From my crude drawings, to Val's enhancements after discussing it with me, to Arthur's excellent, breathtaking final product, you are looking at an accurate representation of what everyone, with a Higher Self, really looks like. The oval, glowing energy being IS you! The energy extensions descending from the central orb are one for each incarnation. As we have hundreds and hundreds of incarnations, space limitations required a depiction of only several streams per Higher Self. These energy cables are the 'silver cords' seen in astral travel. Each extension ends in a physical incarnation. Earth incarnations are simultaneous, hence all are alive at the same time but in different phases (time periods). Genders, races, etc are merely different learning experiences for the Higher Self. The 3rd stream, from your left, of the largest Higher Self indicates an incarnation on the 4th density (astral) after death. The astral levels are depicted as the misty areas above and closest to the incarnated humans. They are ALL you! If you look closely inside the Higher Self, you'll notice small ovals along the left wall. These represent each individual incarnation for that individual Higher Self. The Final Incarnation can access each of the Higher Self incarnations by simply touching any one head to see through that stream's eyes. The corkscrew in the center is not a part of the Higher Self. This is a graphic representation of energy spiraling up through the opening in the top, center of the Higher Self. This opening is the path the Higher Self will follow after the Final Incarnation is completed and all energy streams are absorbed back into the Higher Self, which would now be complete. The Higher Self is, at this point, a true composite of all the Higher Self incarnations and the Final Incarnation becomes the Higher Self. The central, lower object is on the base of the Higher Self, an energy pillar with a multifaceted energy ball on top. This is the central nexus/processing center for the Higher Self and is a natural part of shim. Dominants and Final incarnations may access ANY component or experience of any of the Higher Self incarnations through this ball. It would compare to the ‘brain’ of the third density body. You will see several other Higher Selves engaged on their Paths. This is how I saw them. The energy shown at the top of each Higher Self is the path that the Higher Self will follow to the next level of experiences. These upcoming experiences are TOTALLY different than those on 3rd density. The rectangular upper part of the art, with the Higher Self energy ripples, is a depth drawn image. As it gets narrower, farther distance is indicated. When I saw this completed art, I received a pulse of pure joy from my Higher Self. Never before has this been available to 3rd density Earth and to anyone who wanted to see it. It has caused a real buzz among the Higher Selves involved in this whole project. The art is also now prominently displayed in the Library on Monroe level 27! It contains keys needed by many to bridge from 3rd/4th densities to who they REALLY are. This drawing is a missing key for many Very Advanced and, especially, Final Incarnations. Meditate on this drawing and see where it takes you.

All Rights Reserved. The Real Matrix - Above and Beyond Introduction to Matrix V Gold Edition by Val Valerian There have been stories for years about experiments where a clear glass plate is placed in a fish tank and left for an extended period. When the plate is removed, the fish generally remain on their respective side of the tank. The same thing happens when you put gnats in a covered jar for a while, and then remove the cover. Only a few adventurous creatures emerge, but the bulk of them remain in their self-imposed isolation from the rest of the universe. One of the primary attributes possessed by those few adventurous individuals who escape is awareness (awareness of the environmental context, and a sense of the “potential beyond”) and knowledge that exceeds that of the general population. What happened to the fish in the tank and the gnats in the jar? Somehow, their original intent, freedom and nature was subverted by something else, first imposed from an external source and then willingly, but unconsciously, self-imposed with equal vigor in deference to the perceived existence of the status quo ... because they believed it was so. It wasn’t. The same thing happens to those having a “human” experience. An interesting description of this process was mentioned by author Tarthang Tulku in his 1978 book entitled Skillful Means: Gentle Ways to Successful Work (Berkeley, CA: Dharma Publishing, 1978, 5-6). Tulku summarizes the social process: “Our obstacles to inner freedom are usually formed during childhood. As children we know how we feel about things, and we seldom hesitate to make our feelings known. But pressure from family and friends leads us to adopt the more narrow views and patterns that conform to what people expect. When our natural ideas and feelings are discouraged, we grow out of touch with our senses, and the flow of communication between our bodies and minds is inhibited; we no longer know what we truly feel. As the patterns of suppression grow stronger and more fixed, our opportunities for self-expression diminish. We become so used to conforming, that as we grow older we let these patterns rule our lives; we become strangers to ourselves.” Most social institutions of great significance on this planet (religions, governments and cultural traditions) actively promote their version of information dealing with the ‘big questions’ in life. Who are we? Why are we here? What more is out there? Yet, anyone having the time to do any degree of research at all eventually realizes that what we are faced with is a situation where open deceit has been institutionalized on a planetary scale. Faced with that, people cannot really find out the nature of reality and the answers to the big questions except as defined by planetary and cultural mind-maps and institutions. The thing that people readily seem to do is search for a philosophy or other mental paradigm (way of thinking or perceiving) in an attempt to balance the apparent failure of the planetary social structure and give them a sense of peace of mind. But, that doesn’t work, because the actual nature of what is happening concerns things that transcend social consciousness, which is the main source of information for most people. But, since you can’t solve a problem using the same perceptive viewpoint in which it was created, nothing goes anywhere and everything stays the same. You must get outside the box. 1"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The 1999 movie Matrix was surely, in some way, metaphorically or otherwise, patterned after the Matrix book series, beginning with the 1988 book The Matrix - Understanding Planetary Power Structures, followed by all our other books, in terms of discussing covert control and manipulation of the planetary population by nested factions vastly different from what the population would expect, given their culturally programmed view of reality. I have always marveled at the synchronicity of the appearance of this film, in an almost “Montauk-like” fashion, in this time stream. Of course, there are no ‘coincidences’ (linear perspective), only synchronicity (non-linear), so that shouldn’t have been a surprise. Now that the movie is in the public mind, and sequels are virtually “in the can”, the notion that “reality can be manipulated and it isn’t what it seems” is now in the public awareness, albeit even as science fiction. There is a long list of synchronicities connected with The Matrix, ever since I put it together and published it in 1988. This involves a deeper aspect of the unfolding of reality here on 3 rd density which eventually resulted in this unique book, now in your hands. Notice how the word ‘Matrix’ has interpenetrated society since 1988. In terms of the personal exploration of our planetary reality, as well as the control systems behind it, one of the most useful developments during the last several years was the understanding of the unique mental reality maps and belief systems that characterize cultural programming on this planet. The seminal book on the subject, The Paradigm Conspiracy, by Christopher Largent and Denise Breton, was allegedly suppressed by the owners of the publishing company through \"negative marketing” after discovering that a staff editor had approved the project and it was printed. I made contact with the authors, and they told me that they had been inspired to do the book after they read Matrix II, which of course is another instance of synchronicity. And, it was nice to have inspired such a piece of work. The book assumes a mid-level perspective, but it’s nice. This understanding is essential (for those predisposed to evolve their perspective) in order understand and transcend the “box” which makes up the “social reality” in which we individually live. The socio-technical side is covered in Matrix III. Now that we’ve entered the next century, it is a certainty that many people have exceeded the mental map of reality endorsed by orthodox social consciousness, and there is a greater call for accuracy that has kept par with the search for truth, which of course is relative. To that end, especially considering personal involvement with a series of very interesting evolutionary processes during the last four years, a new Matrix has manifested itself - one which far transcends all before it. The real nature of reality makes planet Earth a grain of sand on a beach, albeit a very interesting grain of sand for us to explore. The beach in the movie Contact is apropos. In terms of experience, reality has physical, mental, emotional, social, planetary, spiritual, and dimensional-density aspects to it. Typically, the last three are not figured into the equation (because they generate knowledge and information which transcends social perception), and no one can see the “box” or what it’s made of. On Earth, the general population is barely aware of planetary aspects beyond wars and weather fronts. Spiritual aspects? Well, look around you and see the blind lead the blind. For individuals, these aspects form a unique composite that specifically suits each unique incarnational experience. For a great many people, however, “reality” does not include spiritual, planetary and dimension-density aspects to any significant degree. Such people are totally immersed in social and cultural awareness, but have little else in their lives, never suspecting that life is a lot more interesting than they could ever dream. However, lives simply reflect aspects of situational experience that the Higher Self requires.

One group isn’t “better” than the other. They just have different perspectives and levels of general awareness at the time. Let’s step outside the box. Experience in the Non-Physical Universe: Statistically Commonplace \"The greatest illusion is that we have limitations”- Robert A. Monroe Many statistical studies have been done over the years on the population in order to determine the degree to which people experience awareness outside and apart from any awareness while in the physical body (Green 1968, Poynton 1975 , Blackinore 1982,1983,1984, Irwin 1988, and Glicksohn, 1989). A conservative estimate is that 35 out of every 100 people have regular or periodic out-of-body awareness. That means that in the United States alone 98 million people could be familiar with the idea, to one degree or another, that they are not their body, but they as “persons” are more than their body and can have awareness, mobility and a totally separate existence apart from it. Yet, because of the degree of social programming in ‘body identification’, ‘gender identification’, ‘job identification’ and who knows what else, people are hesitant to extend the implications of that knowledge into their lives, mainly because they don’t know who they are or why they are here. Using these same percentages, together with some deep knowledge about the nature of different kinds of ‘human’ incarnations on this planet, it is possible to say that theoretically 735 million people out of 6 billion have had these kind of experiences at least once in their lives - about 13% of the population of the planet can relate to experience and independent existence apart from organic bodies. That’s a lot of out-of-body experiences! Why 13%? Since at this time about 65% of the humans on Earth at this time are not, in actual fact, Higher Self incarnations, that leaves 35% - so 35% of 35% is about 13%). The majority of the human population at this time is actually incarnated animal spirit from one species or another. The ratio used to be different earlier in the history of the planet, I am told, and has varied depending on the dynamic present on the planet at that time. More organic bodies are available here than Higher Selves can use for incarnation purposes. It is known that Monroe knew about this, but never revealed this in his books. That kind of “human experience” is different than the “human experience” of Higher Self incarnations. More information on this is in the material. Ever wonder why some religious belief systems feature reincarnation as animals? Now you know. A member of the British royal family wanted to “come back as a virus” to get rid of planetary population, when asked if he “believed in reincarnation” a couple years ago. If nothing else, that statement lays his regressive awareness out on the table for all to examine. Maybe he should go on Survivor. Knowledge of the layout and dynamics involved with these realms is some of the most closely guarded information on the planet, because public knowledge of the true nature of reality could seriously damage earth culture control and manipulation structures. See the article entitled Organized Planetary Out of Body Activities & Polarity Influence, and it is for this reason that general exploration in these areas has been discouraged by orthodoxy, along with frequent ‘reminders’ to re-stimulate cultural and genetic programming relative to the body. They can’t have truly ‘free’ entities wandering around telling the population they’ve been lied to their whole lives about the nature of the universe, can they? According to Robert Monroe, the research at the Monroe Institute encountered hundreds, if not thousands of intelligent beings of all types, just a “phase-shift” away” from our “reality”.

That statement, which is one of the curious anomalies in the book, when compared with what we know to be the case, leads one to wonder if it had to be put there because Robert Monroe was under some sort of duress from the government folks who hobnobbed at the Institute not to add to the existing public drama about aliens. That’s the only sensible conclusion, based on the evidence. There are a couple more anomalies, and after you read and understand this book you will have the knowledge to recognize them, plus you can re-read the Monroe books with an understanding that exceeded that of Monroe himself at the time he wrote the books. Monroe stated that at the time he wrote the book, the estimate for out-of-body experience was 25% of the population, yet available literature and studies dated from years earlier indicated the approximation of 35%. Was this a deliberate slight misrepresentation given to underplay the commonality of experience? You decide. Matrix V represents, in terms of spiritual growth information, some of the most powerful information that will ever be released on this planet, and it will help you “de-code” a lot of things. It’s like wearing the eyeglasses on “ They Live”, letting you see beneath and beyond the reality you are experiencing. Only those who have, or are on the edge of, an advanced current incarnational perspective will be moved by their Higher Self to find and read this material. But, try and remember to walk your talk, striving for balance, and always opt for the highest perspective, relative to the specific issue at hand, that you have in your mind, in order to help maintain that balance. Frankly, this book is the only book that exists on the planet right now that has this high level of information. For the advanced incarnation, 98% of the literature and information on the planet is pure synthetic bullshit designed to keep you in one box or another. It definitely frees up your time for real evolution when you realign your priorities. One recent television program on the Sci-Fi channel that started in 2000 is John Edwards - Crossing Over, in which long-time psychic John Edwards becomes a conduit for those “seeking validation” relative to relatives that have passed. To the audience, and probably John Edwards himself, the “place” he is communicating with is just “over there”, as opposed to “over here”, with no other information. Which, of course, is why it is allowed on public programming. Even this little bit of “cosmic leakage” isn’t well tolerated. On an episode of Larry King Live on March 6, 2001, John Edwards was the guest. King brought on a Leon Jaroff (skeptic), rabbi Botech (religion) and Paul Kurtz (materialist) in order to counteract the “paradigm-stretch” Edwards represented. Jaroff is well known for his position, which isn’t far away from the “amazing Randi”, but more technical. And, rabbi Botech was outraged that the public should be getting anything like the Edwards show because it “threatens the stability of religions”. You could see the frantic fear in the eyes of the rabbi. He was one step short of hauling out his prayer shawl. Kurtz, the materialist, gave a predictably bland “can’t measure it from here, it’s not real” routine. All of this was, of course, foreseeable. Edwards is dealing with recently passed beings dawdling on the 4 th density, still attached to Earth programming, their former incarnational role, concerns, and don’t know there is anything beyond - which, they will eventually discover, there is. What is beyond is the nature of who you really are and what “life” is really about. Just as an experiment, time was spent reviewing the scope and nature of material currently available to the public, especially on the Internet, about these matters. There were so many ‘dead-ends’ spread throughout literature and New Age communities on out-of-body experience, with information polluted by religious belief systems and mindless mental M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Not all the information was directly misleading, but the expanse of the information was very limited. Most of the material out there seems confusing - people having different unusual experiences, but interpreting it from different perceptual viewpoints reflecting their cultural mind set, yet it is the nature of their incarnational perspective that is most important, not generally understood and almost always ignored, because the level of investigation never typically rises above the perspective of social consciousness - a low to mid-level incarnational perspective, and the people doing the investigation don’t have a clue. The information in this book arises from continued, careful observation and experience over many years. The information is not open to conventional ‘debate’, because this material is based on observation and experience, not opinions based on beliefs having no basis in experience. You can surely have your opinion and believe whatever you wish, but it doesn’t change whether or not it is in your actual experience. Things will begin to happen in your life after you read this book, to the degree that you are aligning your persona with your Higher Self, which will be profound in your own unique experience. You might even make some conscious changes in life perspective. Your Higher Self (YOU) is an absolutely unique living energy being of tremendous capability, which is experiencing life on 3 rd density Earth. If your Higher Self is on the simultaneous path, experience is accumulated through a great many different unique incarnational points (all YOU, experiencing) simultaneously throughout the phased spacetime contiuum on Earth in order to gain experience, maturity, knowledge and wisdom for use as a basis on which to further expand your experience at more refined density levels. In order to effectively maintain multiple incarnations simultaneously, memory 011 the incarnational level of pre-incarnational knowledge is blocked, in order to eliminate interference in the experiential process. The Higher Self retains memory of all experience. The predominant incarnational pattern on 3 rd density is, however, sequential, in which Higher Selves only experience one incarnation at a time and haven’t evolved to the point where the Higher Self chooses the simultaneous path. Sequential incarnated retain the memory of previous lives, as well as all the baggage, and have continuity fears. Everything ‘alien’ to Earth comes from a sequential format. All the conformity, control, manipulation, racism and divisive patterns have been inculcated on Earth to suppress the unique individuality expressed by incarnations of Higher Selves on the simultaneous path, in order to divert incarnational progress toward more advanced perspectives outside cultural boxes and to ‘protect’ sequential incarnations and societies from the ‘contamination’ of individualism and more evolved perspectives which threaten group mind sets. Earth is an incarnation point in this galaxy for Higher Selves using simultaneous incarnational mode. All of this is discussed in detail within this book. Just enjoy being who you are and making the most out of your incarnational experience. The specific incarnational thread from your Higher Self that is reading this book is at a point where the inner potential of significant ‘movement’ into higher perspectives and information has resonantly brought the material into your awareness. The information will flow into and among all of your incarnational threads through the Higher Self.

Essential Resources and Recommended Reading Material First of all, there are several books that I recommend that you read as soon as possible, if you haven’t already, that will enhance your understanding of the context and nature of the greater reality we speak of here. Read Monroe’s three books: Journey Out of the Body, Far Journeys and Ultimate Journey, and as far as social mind control is concerned, The Paradigm Conspiracy. We have included some selections from the Handbook for the New Paradigm within this book. We originally had the whole Handbook (available on the internet) in the 2 nd Edition of Matrix V, but we opted to only print the most relevant extracts in the Gold Edition, allowing the reader to have twice the amount of segments, and Q&A, while the book cost stays about the same. We have made an effort to refine the material in Matrix V Gold Edition. Robert Monroe: Planetary Pioneer Robert Monroe (1916-1995)» a veteran of more than 30 years of consciousness research, was a true pioneer in terms of the evolution of human consciousness. The notable work in terms of investigations into the future of man appeared in Far Journeys. In those books, Monroe details his discovery that the Earth is surrounded by “bands” in which individuals congregate after physical death, for varying lengths of time, based on their individual resonant vibration, belief systems or lack thereof. His other books are Journeys Out of the Body and Ultimate Journey, last last book, where the manuscript was severely cut for release to the public, presumably for ‘national security’ reasons, because of the presence of government contracted personnel in the latter portion of his life. Monroe’s whole journey on Earth was monitored by the Darkside so as to limit its impact. Reading Ultimate Journey after Matrix V proves to be an interesting experience. What Monroe refers to as his “I-There” is indeed his Higher Self; his expression “I-Here” refers to his incarnational persona; when he refers to one of his other existing incarnations, he calls them “I-Then”. His books are invaluable for study. Monroe’s books were born from a polarity perspective, whereas the material in Matrix V, which exceeds Monroe’s work exponentially, made it into existence eight years after Monroe’s death only because it originates outside the polarity perspective, from a position of balance - a loophole in the game. Neither polarity expected Matrix V material to appear on Earth, nor could they stop it from happening. Surprise! Simultaneous perspective material on a sequential perspective world! Monroe also played his part in the sequence of events. He knew who the author was in Higher Self terms when he met him at the Institute. The author’s experience at the Institute was a crucial step toward the expansion which would make the information in this work possible. Monroe’s discoveries about these rings/bands are important because of what he discovers later about them around the time period of 3,000 CE. Monroe discovered that the Earth was surrounded by several rings, or bands, that appeared deep gray or brown in color, and that these bands were occupied by discarnate or exteriorized entities who either still occupied physical bodies or who had recently left their bodies as a result of the death of the body. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition 6"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"These bands, described in order of their placement and progression away from the planet, appeared to be broken out as follows: The First Band: Lower Fourth Density The first band appeared to be occupied by entities who appeared to have a preoccupation with distortions of the original survival imprint, and were still bound conceptually to time- space materiality. From the viewpoint of advanced entities Monroe was in regular communication with, this first band reflected “a mass of discordant, undirected thought radiation”. The first band is composed of several distinctly different SUB-BANDS. The first band is the location of entities communicated with by John Edwards on his Crossing Over program. -The first sub-band was occupied by exteriorized entities that still attempted to participate in physical life, albeit with no success, and seemed to be aware of nothing beyond the physical existence they had left. -The second sub-band was occupied by exteriorized entities that were still attached to the physical body in current Earth space-time who were evidently in an out-of-body state, attempting to continue with a physical waking activity. Because of this mode of action, from a more expanded perspective they would seem to disappear from view right in the middle of their activity (on that level) as they awoke back into their physical body. -The third sub-band is occupied by exteriorized entities who have permanently left their physical existence but do not realize it, and are trying to continue a habitual physical existence, often remaining around familiar occupied bodies (still embodied friends and acquaintances) while acting out emotionally-based drives and fears. Monroe viewed this sub-band is one of the major blockages to the flow of human learning experience, and stated that the number of entities in this area will keep increasing as long as specific kinds of “human values” exist on Earth. -The fourth sub-band is occupied by exteriorized beings that are still attached to the “reality of physical matter” (on the third density), although they do realize that they have become exteriorized. These entities have adopted an “anything goes” attitude and mental framework in which they express themselves through “replicas” of physical reality in unusual and bizarre ways. Monroe illustrated one example of a bizarre manner of expression when he told of coming across a seething, squirming pile of human forms trying to sexually stimulate each other to no avail, since they did not in reality still have a physical body capable of such interaction. The Second Band contains exteriorized beings that realize they are no longer in physical form in physical human life, but left their physical life with no awareness or concept that any other possibility for existence exists. Monroe observed that entities in this band appeared to remain motionless and passive, but retained an air of expectancy.

Mid- Fourth Density The Third Band, or ring, contains exteriorized beings who know they have passed through physical death, and still retain a “belief system” relative to “what to expect” after physical death. It is this area that was mentioned in the book War in Heaven. Because of this, the Third Band was broken down into innumerable sub-bands coincident with belief-system orientation. From another viewpoint, if a number of people have a similar belief (as propagated in religious belief systems, for example) they all end up creating a “facsimile reality structure” where they all congregate because like attracts like. Want to have your own flock for a while? It’s another “box” experience. This band is perhaps the largest one, and is also a very manipulative place with all the same game playing and power struggles that went on in physical embodiment on Earth. This band is also the source for the comment “there are many mansions in heaven”. It is also worthy to note that those to “believe” that “there is one life to live and then nothing” congregate at their own resonant level within this band. Monroe described seeing billions of entities, lying in stasis, side by side, in rows. UNLESS YOU KNOW THAT CONSCIOUSNESS, ENERGY AND INTENT CREATE THE NATURE OF REALITY, welcome to an “extended stay” in this area within the Third Band. It’s just experience. High Fourth Density The next general area contains exteriorized entities that are more “advanced” in consciousness than those on the bands below, and have arrived from outside the band areas to prepare for their final human experience on the Earth “below”. From the perspective of those within this band, when an entity on Earth who is advanced in consciousness “dies”, they quickly pass through all the bands and disappear from perception “in a wink”. The Fourth Band is also where the “Park” on Focus Level 27 is located. This is discussed in the material. Change Indicated In The Near-Earth 4 th Density Vibrational Matrix When Robert Monroe was taken to a period in his travels to the Earth in the future, around 3,000 CE, he was surprised to learn that the deep gray and brown bands/rings were no longer around the planet. Instead, there was a single flat ring, which radiated light of its own accord. The ring was full of communication, but no discordant noise. There were no cities or evidence of any mechanized civilization on the surface of the planet. The air was clean, clear and the ecological balance of the planet was restored. He questioned the entity accompanying him about the environment, and it was said that the ecological balance was restored by design, not by virtue of a disaster followed by random rebound back to health. There were no people at all living en masse on the planet, and this was also by design. In fact, the whole planet was at a different frequency level. Monroe eventually came across entities on the planet, but they were non-physical and used non-verbal communication. They told him that they did “use” physical bodies on occasion, and that they kept the bodies, which they referred to as “containers”, manifested from thought patterns using any mass at hand, in “energy cocoons” to keep them preserved, ready for use and in good condition. These entities, even while occupying a body, could transmute matter. One of them materialized a piece of fruit, and gave it to Monroe, who consumed it with relish. They told Monroe he could experience “compressed learning modes”, which they defined as being able to experience “earth consciousness” from the MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 8"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"viewpoint of every species - they could, in essence, integrate their consciousness at will with any life form, experience that life form, and disengage their consciousness from it. There had obviously been a heavy withdrawal from survival imprints and the “body consciousness” of the civilization of the “old Earth”. They could even have the experience of being “eaten alive” (the genetic memory of horror for humans in a body for millions of years) - and pop out again with ease. There was no need for “sleep”, and they could draw energy from ambient space, whether they used a body or not. Now, this is the interesting part. They told Monroe that entities newly arriving on Earth at that time period first had to experience one human life cycle in a period of time before the changes were made, and then they were allowed to spend time there. Monroe was told that these one-time experiences were going on in the 20 th century for some of those destined to return to occupy the dimensional area around Earth in 3000 CE+. Those who graduated from the Earth environment in 3,000 CE did not return to Earth. They no longer needed to experience Earth and could take on physical forms in lessening degrees of density and radiation patterns until they no longer felt the need to do so ... on their journey to the infinite growth patterns of consciousness that are available for all to experience', eventually. The Experience of Spiritual Incarnation In An Organic Body Why come to Earth in the first place? Earth is not the only place in the universe where there is a time-space reality system, nor does it lie on the only vibratory level where there are space-time realities, but life here (because of the nature of life on Earth and the extreme dualities and polarities involved) represents one of those places that represents a unique challenge to any entity who has problems to work out that require such a location. According to Monroe, any time-space scenario (of which Earth is a whopper!) has unique aspects which contribute interesting ways to the development of both intelligence, awareness and experience. You won’t find an entity like 6 th level jehovah entities who are even willing to go through such experience. Because of that, many entities that reside on other vibratory levels have not developed knowledge of what love, compassion and empathy really are - that’s why they feel the need to be obeyed, worshipped, and identify with CONTROL and MANIPULATION. Going to a level where the NORMAL non-physical rules of existence are suspended is beyond their willingness to give up their identity with control. Next, it requires that you select a propitious birth entry point with appropriate genetic, environmental, social, political and economic patterns that you calculate will ensure realization of the very purpose for your entry into 3 rd density, despite the existence of variable that could severely impact the realization of ones purpose, and the whole journey may involve taking certain actions to realign the probable/possible income. Since there are many who seek embodiment experiences (and many who seek to avoid it at all cost), very often a specific kind of birth entry point is not available, and one is presented with less than ideal circumstances. It’s sort of like bungee-jumping without the cord. Bam! Out of the tube with previous memories veiled and into the light. No longer in your natural state, you suddenly discover that the physical body has severe restraints. A while is spent playing with your toes and other strange appendages, trying to obtain control over them before they obtain apparent control over you (that happens later when “body consciousness” is reinforced to the maximum through social conditioning). In your natural state, energy simply flowed to you. Now you have this overwhelming desire to consume nourishment for the body, amidst a cacophony of sensory overload, genetically- programmed drives (and later, raging hormones), genetically (and later culturally) M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Combine all of these with pain, pleasure, sexual stimulation and body-driven emotional complexes. What a bungee jump! Since you are seemingly stuck in a genderized body, you are subject to various brain learning mechanisms. Primary learning occurs when you focus on something. What you do not have a focus on (when you have a focus on something else) is the “stuff” involved with secondary learning processes, and a third form of input occurs while your body is sleeping and you end up in a brief, non-functional void. Initially, and probably throughout a good part of your life, your attention is motivated by virtue of the pain-pleasure cycle. Then, you go to cultural “school”. “School” is a process of non-educational programming stressing low-order repetitive experiences and the physical senses, which results in an unnatural situation centered around the knowledge, manipulation and control of physical matter and low-order energy systems geared toward reinforcing survival imprints and social ego- orientation, as well as BELIEF patterns, many of which are not at all based on actual experience, which results in the establishment of a secondary psychological drive in society to “look for what is true”. The process also eliminates any remaining threads of contact with essence-memory and knowledge of your actual origin and identity. Then, you “interact in society”. Society is where the individual is conditioned to identify with the body and then the ego/image, in that order, and accumulate emotional attachments relating only to expression in a time-space reality, to the degree where a compulsive need develops to re-enter the time-space continuum (trapped on the lower rings, again?) solely for the purpose of satisfying the need to complete physical agenda. “Human” existence can become addictive. The original genetic survival drive of the body becomes further distorted through cultural programming and results in distorted patterns which focus on body protection (where is that gun?), body maintenance (what IS that new aftershave?), sexuality and reproduction, and the need to “protect things” that “one owns” in order to “support the body”. As if that is not enough, sex as a creative act is distorted to the point where it results in irrational and restrictive “attachments” and “commitments” based on cultural ideas that are actually unattainable, besides being an addictive perspective itself. But, they don’t tell you that, do they? You’ll understand a lot more as you read this book. You are advised to go through the material once, read the Q&A and then re-read the material for the maximum impression. Important: You may believe you “are” a “male/man”, or a “female/woman”, only when you as an androgynous spiritual being operating through a body buy into the cultural lie and the DNA programming that says or makes it seem you “are” your body and the gender of the body. Are YOU really a “male”, or a “female”? No! However, most incarnations here think they are! When you read the term “male/man” or “female/woman” later in the main material, the author is talking about those who at this time believe they are their body and gender, not the spiritual being who they really are. If you take some of the material relating to gender “personally”, that shows your orientation, right? Right. To be “offended” on one hand, and at the same time claim to be in a spiritual orientation, just shows you’re trying to fool yourself. You can’t, so don’t try. You would do better, to the degree you can, to move toward orientation with YOU, and alignment of your “persona” with who you REALLY are. No one knows YOU better than YOU. Your various persona are temporary.

Except for experience. All of this results in the “search for the meaning of life”, because the creative energy within the essence, the spirit, is functionally diminished to where the SOURCE and one’s true identity, is forgotten. Monroe’s Recommendations Monroe’s advice about experience on Earth was to: 1. Store the memory, experience and wisdom in life and leave the emotion connected with the experience behind. 2. Recognize that you are responsible for the results of your actions within a space-time continuum. 3. Enjoy the cosmic humor in life. You need to expand beyond social consciousness to see it. 4. Seek to remove emotional energy from your being connected with pain/pleasure connected memory patterns. 5. Maximize sleep periods, promoting tertiary learning processes, creating a break from left-brain thought patterns and “physical input”. A lot of these recommendations Monroe made with the intention of giving people guidance on “purging” habitual thought patterns and beliefs. If everyone took his advice, John Edwards would play to an empty house. Of course, that’s not going to happen. Monroe’s Meeting With Some of His Incarnations An interesting interaction in Ultimate Journey, Chapter 12, occurred between Robert Monroe and what he termed his “executive committee”. In his travels outside 3 rd density, Monroe encountered this group of entities who indicated that in all the times during his life where he had anomalous incidents (such as coming through unscathed after an accident, or finding something you really needed, just when you needed it, or listening to a subtle voice and acting on it) it was them, either one or more, sometimes even from other energy systems, who actually manipulated circumstances in physical reality to allow “Monroe” to reach an understanding or goal which was in line with his incarnational mandates - the main purposes, intent and experience desired by the Higher Self in the first place relative to that specific incarnation. Asked by Monroe if they were his ‘guardian angels’ “They” replied: “We aren’t your anything. You and we are the same. You’ve been helping yourself all the time. We are just the part that helps you remember.” Most surely, adventures in consciousness are sometimes like psychotherapy on steroids, producing tremendous leaps in understanding and knowingness. Monroe asked why people went through multiple lifetimes, and it was indicated that the unique nature of experience as a “human” meant that it was not possible to get enough 3 rd density experience in one incarnation. These other components of Monroe’s Higher Self indicated that information MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge Internationa! Research Group.

All Rights Reserved. from more than a thousand incarnations on Earth, relative to his Higher Self, is immediately on hand: “Every possible situation is here, every emotion. There is nothing you can encounter in an Earth life that isn’t stored here ... in fifty different ways.” They told him that he had incarnated this time to pick up one final piece of experience, and that after this “they would be gone” to a place only Monroe’s “I-There” (Higher Self) could tell. Simultaneous incarnations are in different periods because the different dynamics provide more varied experience. Although not on 3 rd density Earth, sequential incarnations in 3 rd density are typical of “alien” experiential processes. It is also where we started before we chose the simultaneous path of acquisition of experience. Sequential incarnations experience a lengthy evolution in societies that are usually socially boring, where everyone looks the same, acts the same, etc., and the planet or race evolves as a group. Monroe pondered on the idea of the incarnations that had seemingly “run astray” by being caught up in belief systems, and indicated that it seemed “like a waste”, but he was told that much was learned from what happened in those experience - there are no wasted incarnational experiences. It also appears that one task of Higher Self complexes is to “pick up” previous personalities who had become so overwhelmed with Earth life, it’s addictions and belief systems that “the essence of the personality was unreachable”, and restore those personalities. One of the more interesting discussions about what Monroe called the “I-There”, what we refer to as the Higher Self, revolved around a discussion about an un-named field of energy which penetrates both inside and outside of space-time, throughout all the densities. According to Monroe, this spectrum of energy was seen as divided into various “bands”, one of which involves an aspect of this field that actually “in-forms” or enfolds intelligence into life forms. According to information given to Monroe, the Higher Self is composed solely of this field energy. Orthodox Research on Consciousness and Experience Levels Although there are many sources of information relating to out-of-body experience, research indicates that one of the main sources of technical information on consciousness and levels of experience, and the multi-density infrastructure in which it sits, comes from the work of Robert Monroe. We did a survey of literature generally available on the subject, and very little work out there goes beyond subjective description, sometimes tempered with semi-religious overtones and explanations dependent on 3 rd density cultural concepts or even babbling from 4 th density entities with one agenda or another. None of the orthodox literature even touches the subject. The work of Charles Tart and a continual string of speculative thought from ongoing conferences are about all the public seems to get. Most studies of consciousness available to the general public seem to mix psychology and psychiatry, together with a smattering of neo-Darwinism and body-identification, resulting in a continual mind-matter circular discussion which has gone on for years without achieving any success, because real “success” must come by virtue of a paradigm shift which would expose their perspective as passé. So, people really have no dynamic process of growth in this area available within most cultures on Earth. On purpose.

Movement from Physical to Non-Physical Awareness The incarnational “hookup” to the human body appears to depend on a blending of the energy field generated in the brain with the energy field present in the energy connection with the Higher Self at a different density and phase difference. Monroe developed a term “phasing” as a term to assess constant movement of the Mind focus between states of perception, relative to movement toward or away from non-physical states. Monroe also discovered that a specific kind of non-physical energy field interpenetrates the entire span of space-time, including everything in 3 rd density - he called it the “M” field. This energy spectrum, at a local level, contains all thought emissions from every being on Earth, with its cacophony of disorganized random thought patterns. According to Monroe, and others who have spent considerable time personally experiencing levels of consciousness, there entities “out there” who have the ability to manipulate specific bands of this field to achieve certain effects for their own purposes. This field overlaps the life forms on Earth, but is out-of-phase with it. Learning to “tune” parts of the field “in” or “out” is part of the process of training. Robert Monroe was instrumental in developing workable techniques. At one point Monroe allegedly developed a machine that would literally exteriorize someone, but its use was discontinued. Hemi-Sync was then developed for the use of students at the Monroe Institute and the general public, and became a valuable tool for personal exploration. Most people who have even touched on the subject of consciousness studies recognize that there are different states of consciousness that one experiences, for instance, as one falls asleep. There is, of course, that famous point between waking and sleep where the body goes to sleep, often with detectable paralysis, while the mind and attention remain fully awake. What is usually discussed is the progression from alpha waves through delta waves of deep sleep, but there is more to this process than meets the eye. According to the understanding provided by Robert Monroe, as the signals from the physical senses fade out while the person remains awake, there is actually a movement of consciousness deeper into this “M” field, where one eventually begins to perceive series of whole new environments and experiences. Monroe created an arbitrary series of numbers to measure the movement into the field, called “focus levels”, matching distinct perceptual frontiers that appear as awareness moves into this field with an ever-increasing numerical equivalent, creating an initial system to measure the degree of “phase shifting”. The first step in focus is called Focus 10, which is generally described as being in that place where the body is asleep but the mind is awake and alert, the mind focus being slightly shifted from a normal state of being awake, with input from the physical senses much reduced. According to Monroe’s research, this level is consistent with the point of conscious entry into the physical world. One of the most interesting levels reached next, as ones’ awareness begins to move further into the field, was deemed Focus 12. Monroe used to use hemi-synch techniques, unique sounds patterns, to induce movement into this area. After one has been to Focus 12 enough times, the external sound patterns are no longer necessary. According to Monroe, on Focus 12 lies the “gateway” to the Higher Self, among other things. A part of what one experiences in Focus 12, at least in the early stages, are movement of patterns and colors, and geometrical shapes.

One method used to reach the Higher Self is included in the Q&A section. Focus 12 is a level where individual can have an access point to intuitional information about all their incarnations. Experience begins to include intuitional information processing from feeling- based data. The mind perceives through non-verbal precognitive filtering systems. Access to usual human senses is diminished by about 80%. Synesthesia is a common experience at this level of focus, where one experiences feeling colors, seeing.sounds, etc., as sensory processing begins to change. It appears that between major areas “depths” of focus, there are zones where there is not much activity at all, so-called “Null Zones”. Focus 13 and 14 are Null Zones. The next level of interest was tagged Focus 15, marked by an extremely small amount of sensory input from the physical and even more in the “M-field”. At this level intuitional experience becomes very strong. A timeless place containing quantum or large groups of information rather than detailed bits. Information about other places, people, and elements of different time periods can be accessed here and will sometimes be transmitted in “bundles of meaning” (Monroe calls them “rotes”). Focus 16 through 20 constitute energy levels that you pass through on your way to Focus 21, and do not contain much of interest. The state externally characterized by physical deep sleep and production of Delta-waves, with the mind fully conscious is called Focus 21. In Ultimate Journey, Monroe termed Focus 21 as “the maximum range of comfortable phase relationship between time-space and M field participation - the edge”, and said that from this level of conscious awareness one could verify all the material and concepts related in his books. It is also at Focus 21 where it becomes apparent that movement from “place” to “place” is a function of will, and that your real intention is a key to where you will end up, instantaneously. This 4 th density level is loosely occupied by various kinds of beings on an ongoing basis. The vast level of Focus 22 is characterized by human dream realities, as conscious awareness moves further into the field. Lucid dreaming, of course, is characterized by full awareness and the knowledge that you can control the reality you are dreaming (producing). It is that knowingness which transforms the experience into a lucid one. Being in Focus 22 and not awake is typical of someone who is in a coma. This is a place where your awareness begins to move further into non-physical 4 th density. Focus 23 is a lower astral level populated by recently deceased individuals from Earth who do not realize their transition, or believed there was no existence after physical existence (billions of entities remain here asleep), and those who are temporarily stuck. Level 23 is the temporary residence of those who separate from the physical under traumatic circumstances, through suicide, sudden death or disasters. Insane or near-insane emotionally driven beings are present. Sexual release is motivation of entity inhabitants. This level is also known as the beginning of Locale II ( Journeys Out of the Body). The beginning of reality “where thought is action.” . For further description of the activities, and denizens of this area, please refer to Journeys. Focus 24 begins the area of where the malleable nature of reality makes it readily apparent that realities are literally, “hands on”, a product of what you belief them to be, as one may or may not realize one’s total responsibility for what one is literally creating. This level is populated by discarnate entities or those stuck in aberrant behavioral patterns which prevent them from realizing crucial aspects about the nature of reality and moving on. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition 14"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Focus 24 is also described as part of Locale II. ( Journeys Out of the Body). Focus 24 is the beginning of the area of Belief System Realities, which extends to Focus 26. Focus 25 continues the 4 th density band of Belief System Realities, where groups of people who still maintain strong belief systems fueled by 3 rd density Earth cultural concepts congregate by resonance, since “like attracts like”. This level is also populated by discarnate entities or those stuck in aberrant behavioral patterns which prevent them from realizing crucial aspects about the nature of reality and moving on. There are areas in which entities stuck in every major Earth thought pattern congregate, until they happen to wonder if there is more, and then they appear to “wink out” and appear in another 4 th density area coincident with their thought patterns, or move to whatever resonant place suits them. Focus 26 is the last area within the band Belief System Realities, and contains what Monroe referred to as the “Religious Terminus”, where religious groups, people of every ironclad Earth belief system, congregate until they realize there is more beyond where they are. There is even a temple of zeus, with some people having even chosen to appear like “jesus” and every other religious figure in order to play with, control or manipulate the “ex­ humans” who haven’t progressed. There are people here, flush with the new-found power of personal reality manipulation, who see themselves as “god” and even go so far as demanding to be worshipped! Remember the book War in Heaven ? Monroe related just such an incident in Ultimate Journey and described these areas in detail in Far Journeys. For the adventurous who aren’t burdened by heavy belief systems and have left their physical existence behind (or who visit here through an OBE from the Earth’s surface), Focus 27 begins an area that was created millennia ago, by those who felt that people needed a place to recover and examine life after their experience on Earth. This level has been called “The Park”, where you can visit the library (containing every work ever created on Earth, which of course includes this book) and virtually all knowledge, even about things not regarding Earth. There are also places for life review, healing centers, classes and all sorts of activities. Within the next millennium, this too will disappear as everyone advances and it is just not needed any more. Focus 28 is an astral “bridge” zone, a buffer area. Experience from here on takes on a wondrous character, beyond anything you have experienced on 3 rd density. Focus 29 is where 5 th density roughly begins, with advanced non-physical levels extending to Focus 34, where a great collection of Higher Selves experiencing Earth incarnations exist, moving into Focus 35. Once the Higher Selfs path/experiences chosen for the 3rd density Game have been concluded, all the incarnations will be “drawn in” and the Higher Self moves further out into the field, up into the 7 th or 8 th density, where it will typically send out more “probes” of awareness to experience things on these levels. There appear to be several main “nodes” of the Higher Self, the lowest density one sits on the 5 th , around Monroe focus level 34/35, at this time for most beings having 3 rd density incarnational experience. There are a limited number of these “nodes”, although they extend well up into the density levels, where experience goes into profound levels of expression. There are no limits whatsoever, for anything, or anyone. You will create realities - with the experience you have had on Earth and elsewhere you will know better what you do not want to create, why, and how polarity-thought and lack of balance retard progression and evolution.

All of your simultaneous incarnations (YOU) provide information which is used by all of your incarnations through your Higher Self (YOU). Learning by one of your incarnations benefits all. You have no real reason to be uncomfortable with the unique presence of YOU, or its changing levels, that’s reading this book. The Potential Planetary Effect of These Explorations Considering that one of the core beliefs which sustains the view of reality that is programmed into the population is bodv-identification. supplemented and reinforced with gender-identification (if you can get a person to “buy into” that too) and any other identification process that leads a person away from discovery of Self and potential evolution, what would it be like, theoretically, if the truth came out? There would be no discrimination based on race or gender, and all the other synthetically created “ills” of the world based on the body, including consumerism and the world economic structure would go “poof’, as people no longer bought into the ubiquitous bullshit. In this incarnational experience, the vehicle is biological with distorted DNA programming, further distorted by a toxic environment, and we have planet full of sleeping ’’humans”, most of whom seem to be “Forrest Gumping” their way through life. That’s an experience, too, coming in, because of the DNA alterations in your vehicle, your complete memory access has been blocked. You have to work all your life here to gain insight through experience. Talk about a challenge! The journey and the process are important.

Matrix V Gold Edition — IIow to Maximize The Experience Read the collection of segments over a period of time, while at the same time reflecting on your ongoing experience. Don’t try and overextend yourself to the point where you get tired and your attention wanders. Give yourself a chance to absorb and reflect on the material. What you don’t understand immediately you may well understand later on in the book when it ‘clicks’. Look at the index in the back of the book to see the scope of the book. Certain information is repeated in different places in order to maximize understanding of specific related subject areas. Read all the Q&A. If you then go back and re-read the segments, this process will maximize the depth you will reach with the material, all the while keeping an eye on your perspective, your experience, and what you observe, both externally and most importantly internally. Effectively processing this book does take time and focus. See the reader comment section in the back for comments from those who found that multiple readings accelerated evolution of their perspective in different ways. Enjoy the book. It is truly the very best, most advanced and most accurate spiritual information available on the planet. Presented purposely in a ‘no-holds-barred’ style in a series of essays by the author, the material will challenge you to think, to reach, and to explore life in new ways, as you resonate more and more with the nature of your Higher Self during ongoing experience. To the degree that you still identify with your body or gender, or are steeped in any heavy value judgments, you will have some special challenges. Trust your Higher Self and see where experience takes you.

All Rights Reserved. Author’s Inti'oduction to the Second Edition (Author’s Introduction to Gold Edition Follows) Back in the early fall of 1999 , I felt that I must begin sharing my experiences and observations as a Final Incarnation. This started as emails to Val and a couple other friends. After a steady stream of information, Val decided to put many of them on his Leading Edge web site (www.trufax.org). Now that, plus much more, is here in Matrix 5. Who would have thought? I sit here with a 1 and 3/8\" stack of printouts of everything I've sent in email form. This material was never intended for the general population because the general population would not be able to grasp it, so deeply entrenched in The Game are they. The only ones who would be able to grasp this icon-smashing material are Final Incarnations and, to a great degree, Very Advanced incarnations. My advice to anyone reading this material is to deal with it individually. If you read sections that make you want to scream, 'that just can't be so', just push it to the side. Remember, your path blossoms like a flower with many petals, gradually, until you shine in your Final Incarnation, and so does your awareness. Questions about the material have been encouraged and my responses, to these questions, are included in Matrix 5. I enjoy the questions. So many of them have stimulated me to reveal even more information. If you have questions on my material, I invite you to send them directly to me at authorthe@hotmail.com. I answer each genuine inquiry about my materials. If you still prefer playing much of The Game and think yourself capable of quoting the fictitious jesus or other religious traps, save your time as these comments are deleted to the trash bin they belong in. Fortunately, very few of these Game-induced comments have found their way here. The Game, as you will read in Matrix 5, is the illusion known as 3rd density life with its polarity-induced controls. Dark and Light polarities and their silly games, many of which are discussed in here, fortunately do not exist in the levels beyond 6th density. Polarity games are like grade school: lots of spiteful kids, bullies and control groups. All these are designed to keep you from knowing who you are and to give your power to others. Polarity is well depicted in the yin-yang symbol, but, contrary to popular belief, the symbol does not depict Balance. Balance is the expert blending of the two polarities into one. There is a balance of polarities in our galaxy. Some areas heavily Light while some areas are heavily Dark. There are even a few areas where they are roughly in parity. Unfortunately, Earth is in a Dark polarity area. There is nothing that can be done to change this at this time, by individuals or even groups. Dark on Earth, via organized religions, governments, society and secret groups, has too firm a control. The Game must be seen to its ending. Robert Monroe knew this as well. When a leak or challenge confronts The Game, Dark and Light (depending on which polarity feels threatened) are quick to martial forces to quash or discredit the leak, thereby minimizing the 'problem effect'. As Robert Monroe said in Ultimate Journey, the Final Incarnations on Earth, during his lifetime (died 1995), were not interested in ending The Game, but only in their individual self-improvement quests. His Higher Self was the only 17"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

I am one of those he was successful with, and I am taking it much further than Bob was able to. I also have no doubt that he was considered a threat and was heavily monitored. This was why we believe that he was unable to release Ultimate Journey in its original form. He told my group that publishers refused to print that book in the way he wanted it to be in print. This was most unfortunate. Bob said the rejecting publishers told him that people couldn't handle what he had to say. I've also discovered Monroe's Higher Self chose an incarnation I've never heard of before, a Split Final. When alive, he had mentioned that he knew he has a parallel incarnation in Russia as a woman 'doing the same thing' he is doing in Virginia. Only his Higher Self can explain why this unique route was taken, however, and it did diminish each of his two Final segments to a certain degree. Once his Russian incarnation is finished, the Split Finals will merge into his single Final Incarnation. Each Higher Self will choose experiences and a Path unique to the needs of that individual Higher Self. The trap of conformity is one that would have you deny who you are. Polarities thrive on conformity. Be like us, vote like us, hate like us, hurt like us, reward who obeys - all these are polarity controls. It really grates them when you say, ’I don’t care what you do, just leave me alone’. A typical comeback they enjoy using is the guilt trip: sin, hell, ’god’, etc. That's when you should use a line by Glinda the good witch in Wizard ofOz, 'Begone or a house may fall on you, too'. Yes, begone, you have no power here, especially once you are Awakened. The Earth life system is very addictive. It takes many hundreds of incarnations to regain your spirit (Higher Self) control and spiral out of The Game. As you try to break free, the Earth life system addicts swarm around you with lots of guilt and even threats for your not conforming. You are very vulnerable here, for not only are you dealing with these external gadflies, but also you must subdue the physical's long programmed history and DNA commands. It isn't until you reach your Final Incarnation that you have the spiritual maturity to finally and totally do so. My material mentions much about alien genetic manipulations on Earth. These alien groups look on Earthers as insignificant, as food and as slave labor. The word 'Earthling' is alien in origin. Like 'duckling' or 'hatchling', they refer to helpless newborns needing control . Marvin the Martian loves to use that word. You really should rebel against that term in favor of the correct term - Earther. If someone refers to themselves as an Earthling, do explain what that means to them. You certainly don’t here 'Marsling' or 'Orionling', do you? A prominent facet of our current time period is the growing emergence of female domination and the abuse of males. Not only gender abuse, but also anti-while drum beating is going on, thus making EVERYONE a victim of one sort or another. There have never been so many victims on this planet as there are now. This plays right into both Dark (sadistic) and Light (masochistic) plans. Light loves being the eternal victim while Dark enjoys its role as victimizer. These roles will continue to exist as long as polarities exist. The female problem is due to Orion DNA commands for the intent of open membership in the Orion Empire, which is reptilian female controlled. Their violence is mirrored in the increasingly violent western (primarily American) females. These situations will grow increasingly severe until the Wild Card Events move fully into play. 2012 is not an arbitrary date. Female dominance is pure Dark agenda. They seek power, control and obedience.

Even though the Roman philosopher, Virgil (possibly a Final Incarnation) said this a very long time ago, it applies ever more so today, \"Foolish is the man who trusts a woman\". The corresponding phrase of this is, \"Foolish is the woman who thinks she can change a man\". Of course, this depends on the level of the Higher Self accepting the female challenge. There are a small percentage of exceptions to Virgil's observation, but it remains a good rule to keep in mind. However for you Game players, you have much to learn. These messages are meant to make you think, hence the in-your-face style I've chosen to use in some sections. The gentle awakenings of Light side connected people are not meant to really Awaken you, but rather to keep you asleep. My use of certain buzzwords in the materials is attention getting. I also use common language terms. You will better understand what I say if I don't send you racing for a dictionary every few words. FAR too much is written in mystery and parable. There is a need and a desire for plain talk. I recognize that and give that to you. There are many things I'd like to reveal, but English is language-variety poor. For example, the one word 'love' has many, non-related meanings. However, in some languages, you can find several dozen words for snow. Monroe refers to 'rotes' which are entire concepts passed between spirit beings in one motion. The rote contains EVERYTHING connected to the event shared. I have rotes for which there are NO words in English to translate into. For these, you will have to either discover them on your own (such as in the Library on Monroe Focus Level 27) or be patient until you can receive them as well. I have given you an interpretation of the cover art for Matrix 5. THERE ARE KEYS YOU NEED IN THAT ARTWORK. I suggested, to the small group I lectured, that they concentrate and meditate on the artwork. You are transmitting the image from your eyes, up your energy cord and into your Higher Self for processing. This can prove to be a major assist to your advancement. I have an 18x24 poster of that artwork hanging in my bedroom where it can be the last and first thing I see in relation to sleep. It is in the body's sleep periods that you can receive important information. If you feel so inclined to work with the artwork, you should be able to purchase a copy of the cover art in 18x24 inch format from Val. Events are going to take a turn for the worse VERY soon and quickly. Both Val's and my Higher Selves have given a sense of urgency to get this material out and available to whomever might need it. We wouldn't get these pulses of urgency unless something BIG is about to happen. Those who are meant to have Matrix 5, will have it. I urge you to read, not only my materials, but also the 3 volumes of The Handbook, available on the internet. Robert Monroe's trilogy: Journeys Out Of Body, Far Journeys and Ultimate Journey will give you a huge amount of information on what is out there, especially in the astral. You will learn about the belief system areas (level 25) and the advanced areas (level 27) and the Library, Healing Center and so on. This trilogy is available or orderable from any local bookstore. For information on reptilian meddling, especially in modern day Earth, read David Icke's materials, such as I Am Me, I Am Free; Robots' Rebellion ; and The Biggest Secret. David’s web site is www.davidicke.com. On David's site, you can read about Zulu shaman, Credo Mutwa who has some information on video about Ancient Earthers and the gender-splitting as well as Orion tampering in Africa. Arizona Wilder has a video on David's site dealing with more of the reptilian controls on Earth and names are named!

All this is good to be familiar with, BUT resist becoming obsessed with it to the point that you stop your spiral out and get caught up in the details of 3rd density. Better to pass through these areas like a tourist looking through a window on a moving train. Take note, but keep moving. Acharaya S is great to read. Her 'Christ Conspiracy - The Greatest Story Ever Sold' will tell you all plus more on the corruption known as Christianity. This will be especially helpful for any of you struggling with removing the last vestiges of that poison from your system. Something to keep in mind is NOT to judge yourself by where I am in my progress and on my Path. Each Higher Selfs Path is truly unique to that Higher Self. You are not accountable to anyone BUT yourself. You will not be judged by anyone but yourself. No one has those rights over you. If anyone tries to control you tell them to 'fuck off. 3rd density humans are so use to conforming that you don't realize conformity is limiting to individual expression. The way to proceed is to adapt what works for you, from whatever sources, and recombine all that into something uniquely yours. I've been trained as a astrologer, studied with the wiccans, trained by Native American shamans, etc, but I have combined everything into what I've proven works for me. This is also not a fixed event for me. I'm continually fine-tuning what I know and substituting something for what I've discovered works even better...for me. The meditation I've given in Matrix 5 to connect with your Higher Self is very potent. When you use the format I've given in the materials, move slowly from your crown chakra down to your base chakra using the keywords given. I do this every night just before going to sleep while in my bed and in the dark. I get a burst of energy, especially from my crown and 3rd eye chakras when I do their individual word. Concentrate on each chakra when you do the keyword for that chakra. See what YOUR Higher Self moves you to do. Make the meditation your own but never forget that gold light is THE protective aura. For those of you who have not been able to astral travel as of yet, I recommend Astral Travel by Gavin & Yvonne Frost. They have been friends of mine for about 20 yrs. This book is their astral travel course that they teach through correspondence via their school in West Virginia. The book can be ordered in any bookstore. When I first took astral travel, I couldn't do it. It took me 6 months of steady persistence to FINALLY make it out. It’s like learning to ride a bike, you never forget once you've learned. The Frost's teach you how to travel through time and much more. I recommend the course, but the book is next best. You must get a good background before dabbling into unknown areas. That's why Monroe's trilogy is so important and why, if you can't astral travel, the Frost book is so valuable. The more you learn, the fewer doubts you'H have and the better you can handle your fears. No matter what you can or cannot do today, you will be able to do at some other time or incarnation. Your Higher Self can be put off, to a certain extent, but cannot be denied. You WILL succeed. Matrix 5 may be the most important book you will ever have. Most of the material is not available anywhere else on 3rd density. Some of it is jealously guarded in power/control circles. As I've said, the Higher Selves will not be denied no matter what the polarities think they may be able to get away with. So read Matrix 5, open yourself up to the experience. Even if you cannot grasp it in its entirety, the messages will be registering with YOUR Higher Self, which will take appropriate steps for your Path. Your life, your incarnation ivill change after reading this whole volume. Go with the changes. See where they take you. Most importantly: TRUST IN YOURSELF.

All Rights Reserved. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Author’s Introduction to the Gold Edition Welcome to the Gold Edition of Matrix 5! This is the final stage of the Matrix 5 project. The Higher Selves involved in this project intended for it to be a 2 phased event. The Second Edition reached one plateau. The Gold Edition reaches much higher. Just as I said in the original Introduction, also included in the Gold Edition, that Matrix 5 is not for everyone but was written for Final, Dominant and Very Advanced incarnations. This holds even more true for the Gold Edition. The Second Edition was a test for those who read the materials. It would shock those not yet ready for such dramatic revelations and thrill those who were ready. If they couldn't handle the Second Edition, they definitely would not be able to process the information given in this Gold Edition. While the new information that was added to the First Edition was made available to those who did not desire to get the Second Edition, this is not the situation with the Gold Edition. Due to the nature of the 50 previously unpublished segments and the order of which they are placed within this edition, the entire book should be read from beginning to end to get the maximum benefit of the unpublished segments. The 50 previously unpublished segments contain many important keys that incarnations require to assist them on their path and to overcome locks placed by the Game. The Gold Edition contains hundreds of keys. The readers will eagerly use these keys as needed for their own progression. As with the Second Edition, if you encounter information that you are not able to process at this time, do not get hung up on it. Just push it to the side. Only Awakened Final Incarnations will be able to process the materials in their entirety. Other incarnations will handle it according to their levels of Advancement. Nevertheless, just by reading the Gold Edition, you will give your Higher Self valuable information that will be passed on to select incarnations of that Higher Self. After the Second Edition was published, a Matrix 5 Forum was in operation. The Forum has been closed for quite a while now, although you will read references to it in some segments of M5. Unfortunately, the Forum, while attracting some excellent incarnations, also pulled lower incarnations whose only interest seemed to be to cause disruption of the project. The Leading Edge Matrix 5 site is the only public site authorized to carry the materials that I write. Observations will continue to be place on that site as long as they are able to. EndGame is here. In the Second Edition, I wrote that I am open to questions on the materials that I have written. This will continue to be so and the email address where I can be contacted appears at the end of this Intro. Please remember that many of you need a personal teacher, as I’ve noted in your questions. I am not that person. You must look elsewhere. I have been asked some excellent questions. These appear in the Q&A section of this edition. The Q&A’s will add much to the segment materials. Read them all. I have also been asked some foolish questions, such as to comment on Russian mail order brides. What the fuck does that have to do with M5? Absolutely nothing! Lightsiders have attacked now and then. Their e-mails are loaded with guilt and victimhood fluff when they make demands. I have no time to waste on Lightsiders. The more into EndGame we get, the shriller the polarities become. 21"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. The thrust of the previously unpublished segments began in September 02. I had no idea how many segments there would be, but I never thought there would be 30, much less than 50. At first I thought there would be a second volume of Matrix 5. After discussions with Val, it was decided that there would be a final edition. A Higher Self pulse named it the Gold Edition. There is no other book like this on Earth. It is unique and could only come out at this time during EndGame for the benefit of our simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves. The Handbook trilogy has been removed in this edition. The Handbook is a mid-Advanced level publication. It is excellent for that level and is freely available on the internet. The Gold Edition, however, needs to be a work unto itself with a truly Very Advanced feel to it. The Handbook trilogy, in its entirety, does not belong here, although references to it are scattered throughout. I still recommend this trilogy to those who haven't read it. It is only another step on your way to spiraling out and should be read with that in mind. It has many keys of value to a mid-Advanced level incarnation on the simultaneous path. The Monroe trilogy is also recommended as a necessary prequel to Matrix 5. The Monroe trilogy: Journeys Out of Body, Far Journeys and Ultimate Journey are indespensible to the Very Advanced incarnates. In late December, I informed the project-involved Higher Selves that if there are any segments that they want in the Gold Edition, I would need to know by Feb 21, 03. Everything that you need to unlock your Game induced locks, based on your current incarnation's level, can be found in the Gold Edition. The rest is up to your Higher Self and the path that shim has chosen. We are well into EndGame. Observations, on a global scale, occur almost daily. The White House is currently occupied by an appointed president who wants a dictatorship of the Dark and is the greatest threat to world peace today. Alien groups have been positioning craft in our solar system. Women keep demanding Orion style female rule while harassing men. The world economy is nearing collapse. These and many more examples are to be noted by those who observe. Now is the time to reclaim your power from externals who desire to, above all, keep you from discovering who you really are. It is only by reclaiming your power that you can spiral out of the Game. The sequential alien incarnates are doing their best to beat us at the Game. The Game will continue after we simultaneous incarnates have departed to higher densities, but that is not our concern. Read the Gold Edition and learn. Apply what works for you in your life. EndGame is here. The old Chinese 'curse', \"May you live in interesting times\", has come to pass. It is only a curse to those who fear the future. Those who embrace the future will find it to be an experiential blessing. Final Comment: Matrix 5 was not written as a ‘guide to EndGame’. Any EndGame items I've discussed in here are side dishes to the main meal: Knowing the Higher Self and discovering who you really are. It wouldn't matter if the Game ended tomorrow, 9 years from now or whenever. That is way secondary to connecting with your Higher Self, Awakening in your Final Incarnation and taking back your power. Please keep that in mind when reading the Gold Edition.

MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Information for Very Advanced, Dominant and Final 3 rd Density Incarnations (Observations From the Perspective of a Final 3^ Density Incarnation) To Whom I Direct This Material Since the fall of 1999, I've been giving a lot of advanced information. I do not direct my material to any physical body, but instead to those spirits animating these bodies as only the spirit is capable of comprehending this information. If the body controls the spirit, it will reject all of this outright for it's contrary to its DNA program. The challenge of the spirit to overcome the physical begins with the first incarnation and ends with the Final incarnation. Only a Final gains above 95% control during the incarnation. Until then, the physical will try to exert control and obedience over the real you. An example of this is someone who gets into the occult and, like a switch was thrown, dumps all he*s learned to find the non-existent 'jesus'. The physical wins and the spirit is subdued possibly for the rest of the current incarnation. Even so, the spirit had a chance to exert itself, even if briefly, and has learned from the experience. It takes hundreds of incarnations before the spirit has sufficient experiences to realize there must be more than variations of the same things over and over. Then it takes hundreds of more incarnations for the search for the spirit. The physical keeps it looking for external solutions and 'don't do anything to rock the boat' attitude. The physical loves to give the spirit a seemingly endless stream of doubts, always extending the comfortable cushions of sleep and peer acceptance. It is a long, difficult journey to overcome the DNA commands, however, eventually the spirit wins and departs the Game. All do so at different rates of progress decided by how quickly the spirit learns to mature. It is to these at or near the end of the Game that I search for and these will comprehend. Those who are still primarily their body need to find far more basic teachers. Definitions Shim: A term created as a pronoun referring to the Higher Self and the energy of the incarnations (spirit) of the Higher Self. 'Shim' is a combination of \"she\" and \"him\". Since everything we talk about in Matrix V is relative to the Higher Self, a correct word was needed, as there is NO English pronoun for being BOTH male and female. The incarnations of the Higher Self are suppressed by the Higher Self in response to shim’s willing participation in the Game. Most incarnations on Earth have been conditioned by cultural programming. This is partially to empower the alien DNA commands in the Earther human body and to make the spirit believe that the false identity of the body, the gender, or both is who you actually are. The prime goal of Earther incarnations is to overcome the body/cultural controls, to recognize who you really are and to have an infinitely wide range of experiences on third density Earth. The drive for Awareness increases with experiences and many incarnations. The third density incarnational cycle culminates with the Awakened Final Incarnation. The incarnational drive for Advancement is proportional to the degree of recognition of the existence of who you really are and are not (spirit vs body ID). 23"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Higher Self: The composite awareness of all incarnational and non-incarnational experience and acquired wisdom, existing on a higher density than any of shims extensions which acquire experience. This is the REAL you. The Higher Self progresses in stages. Once you are finished with 3rd density incarnations and your Final Incarnation takes shim's Higher Self to the next level, that Higher Self of you becomes one facet in the next level of your progression and you have a higher version of your Higher Self to work with and gather new, totally different experiences. Eventually you reach a level where you create galaxies and design 3rd density events. It's super neat, but not of any particular concern at the 3rd density level. Even so, this is only another stage of your progression and not the end of it. After each 3rd density incarnation, we go to the 4th density (astral). When the individual incarnation is finished on the 4th density, shim returns to the Higher Self which is on a higher density. The drawing in the main material pretty accurately shows what our true form is, and you can see the form is nothing like human. After the Final Incarnation, all the incarnational streams are pulled back into the Higher Self and the next move is to another higher density than where the Higher Self currently resides-gathering experiences in the form of incarnations. The Higher Self is not formless, shim is oval in form with a luminescent glow of energy. The Higher Self is immortal and eternal. Shim can never die. For those reading Robert Monroe's trilogy, he refers to the Higher Self as the ‘I-There’ and his Dominant Incarnations as the ‘EXCOM’ (executive committee). Robert uses 3rd density technical terms because of his passionate attachment to Earther sciences and related terminology. Earther vs. Earthling; If you live on Earth, you're an Earther. Earthling is a derogatory term used by sequential aliens and accepted by fools as real. Think of duckling...a baby duck; hatchling...a helpless newborn from the egg. The origin is from the reptilians who look on Earthers as food/slaves/surrogates. The -ling addition says how they look on Earthers as under them, children to be ‘taken care of (that’s another topic). As long as you allow that term by using it or not correcting others who do use it, the vibration of the term will continue. There have been some efforts made to change that. In the Babylon 5 series, for example, people were always Earthers. For some reason, in Star Trek, Earthers are never called such, but rather humans, making it sound like ‘all humans’ live on Earth! Identity: ‘Identity’, in its absolute form, is the awareness uniquely resonant with a specific Higher Self. In a physical incarnation the suppression of shim occurs to one degree or another and the personality often assumes it alone constitutes ‘identity’, based on cultural and genetic programming, further complicated by identification with the body or gender of the body, or both, as well as occupation and a host of other \"assignments\". Incarnation: An extension of a stream from the Higher Self into a 3 rd density physical vehicle in order to provide a temporary period of 3 rd density experience for the Higher Self. Incarnational experiences are dependent on the use of a physical form. Much of the experience of the Higher Self is non-incarnational. In the case of Earth experience, the expression of your Higher Self into a 3rd density, physical, humanoid body. We are concerned primarily with Earth incarnations here in this material. When a body \"dies\", the spirit can interact on the astral in whatever way shim is ready, whether to hang around a battlefield, a religious group, the advanced sections or anything in between. When the spirit decided shim has had enough and wishes more (another incarnational experience), shim 24"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. \"winks out\" and that's where the \"end\" to the incarnation is. The Awareness, however, continues. There is a nexus point for all the incarnations of the Higher Self that is signified by the winking out. Unfortunately, our linear perspective on Earth makes it VERY difficult to understand. The \"linear mode\" would comfortably say \"he winked out and took on a new form.\" That would be fine if we had one incarnation at a time, but we (Earther incarnations) don't. Since we have all incarnations at the same time, each varying in length, that is not the case. Higher Self incarnations (low, middle, advanced, dominant and Final) do occur at different time periods in the 3rd density. For example, a Higher Self can choose to have shim's Final Incarnation in Ancient Greece and a dominant in 1994, because each incarnation gets what shim needs out of different time periods. You could have your very first incarnation in 1994 and your Final in 200 BCE — it's all up to the Higher Self, THE REAL YOU, depending on the experience shim wants! Earther incarnations have the distinction of having Dominants (3-4) and a Final. Incarnations will include as many experiences as the Higher Self decides (on shim's own) to have. Each will be male and female (many times over) and all sexual orientations. ALL experiences are stored within the Higher Self just as all experiences you have in the current incarnation are stored in your memory that you can access at will. Higher Selves incarnating on Earth have simultaneous incarnations while those Higher Selves who choose to incarnate on other planets have sequential incarnations. Simultaneous incarnations occur in all frequencies (time periods) that the individual Higher Self desires experiences and growth. These experiences and memories flood into the Higher Self and are needed, in varying degrees, by Advanced, Dominant and, especially, Final Incarnations. Consider the often heard phrase: \"in my last incarnation...\". Since all Earth human incarnations are simultaneous, how can you accurately refer to your 'last incarnation'? What is tagged as your previous incarnation is actually the incarnation in closest frequency (time period) to your own. I've spoken to a few who were born after World War II, for example, but have strong intuitive ties to the War period as different players on that stage. Another example is a man born in the 50's but has strong ties to the American Civil War. For him it's the incarnation closest in frequency to his current incarnation, hence it is his 'last incarnation' in a manner of speaking. This closest incarnation does not reflect on the stage of advancement of your current incarnation. You could be a Dominant, but the closest incarnation may be of mid, low or any other level than your current incarnation. It is not necessary for you to place a value judgment on your closest incarnation. It has a part to play in your journey and is, after all, you. Deia vu - This phrase is used for the sensation of having been somewhere before but knowing you haven't been there in this lifetime. This feeling is due to you being in the same area of another incarnation of yours but at a different time frequency. Your comfort or discomfort is shuttled through your Higher Self. Note: it is not a PAST lifetime; it is ANOTHER lifetime, as all incarnations are happening simultaneously on different frequencies we call time in third density.

MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Event: This is used for regional events. Examples: World Trade Centers destroyed, Earthquake destroys a town, Politician gets killed or any non-global occurrence. Events happen frequently in the Game. Events are used by both polarities who are attempting to force the Game to reflect their views. Wild Card: This pertains to global shaking events. Examples: Aliens make themselves know to the planet in public or Earth Changes that touch the entire planet. The Game has several Wild Cards that MAY get played in Earth's EndGame. The Game; The use of the word 'Game', originates with the Higher Selves. The Empire and the Dark do NOT consider it a game in any way and do not appreciate the reference. Game is used because of the challenges and object: to overcome all the Empire’s best technology and manipulation to regain your identity (Final Incarnation), gather huge amounts of sensory experiences/emotional experiences and develop wisdom. It is a challenge in that you begin with no memory of who you are and have to regain it by means your own Higher Self decides. There is no single path to this enlightenment but there are many false paths put there by the Empire and the Dark to keep you from finding yourself (religion, for example). Every Higher Self will succeed, some faster and some slower, but all will eventually succeed. To find out what you need to do, you must access your Higher Self. Robert Monroe developed the key to this. It is to access a level of consciousness that Monroe called Focus 12. That's how I learned and I know no other way. It's a matter of going within instead of without. When Monroe told the one group I was in how to do it, no one, except me, was interested in doing so. This is something a Final Incarnation really wants to do (access the Higher Self). It cannot be done by someone for you as only you (as your Dominant and Final Incarnations) can have this access and Dominants may not consciously realize they've been there (during sleep) unless psychic oriented. The material I've been releasing has not been released publicly for thousands of years. You can find threads of it in Credo Mutwa's material and Robert Monroe's books, for example. This material is highly suppressed and you can see why. Val is to be honored for putting it out for access to anyone. Even if they aren’t ready to handle it, it will have an effect on their spirit which will assist in their 'future'. This material, in its form on Val’s site, is unique and the vast majority of the information has never appeared elsewhere. It is not in the interest of the Empire that you know these things for it is spirit, not body oriented. That this information is out now should tell you something about Earth's immediate future. Think on that. 26"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Incarnations of the Higher Self Matrix V and EndGame (Special Gold Edition Segment) The Matrix 5 project is unique in this galaxy's Game. It was developed by several Higher Selves within the framework of the rules of the Game. It is intended for simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves to wrap up their participation in the 3rd density Game. It is not written for sequential Higher Selves. They will continue in their extremely slow progress through 3rd density long after we simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves have departed for new Adventures. Nevertheless, certain factions of the sequential players have become aware of Matrix 5. These factions also know that there is nothing that they can do to directly interfere with this project. The Higher Selves involved in this project would not tolerate that. Several months after Matrix 5 came out, I would receive an email with attempts to derail the project by attacking me for writing it. Of course this type of attack has zero effect on me resulting in a block of the senders email address. This occurred yet again today (2/19/03). The effects of Matrix 5 have already rippled through the time line and continue to do so at an increasing pace, NOT challenging any of the Game's mechanisms, but in distributing keys to simultaneous incarnations who have been waiting for them. These keys are needed to spiral out of the Game. This, therefore, IS part of the Game for the simultaneous incarnates as it takes advantage of a loophole. The Game does not react well to those who directly challenge it, but it will not react to you finding a way to the finish line that does not involve polarity conflicts. The sequential aliens, however, do not like Matrix 5 in any form as it shreds their millennia long control/domination of Earther simultaneously incarnating vehicles. Let them rage, it's time for us to graduate! When Matrix 5 was first published 2 years ago, the Library on Monroe Focus level 27 placed an astral copy of this 3rd density Event for any to read or to remove whenever they wished. The supply of Matrix 5 at the Library equals the demand. The book is still there and will be there until all simultaneous path Higher Selves have departed and the Library is no longer needed. When the Gold Edition is published, it replaces the Second Edition on level 27. ALL simultaneous Higher Selves will have incarnations that do access level 27. Therefore ALL simultaneous Higher Selves, via these incarnations, will gain access to the Matrix 5 Gold Edition which contains the final keys needed for our successful completion of the Game. It doesn't matter if your Final or other Very Advanced incarnations are in the Dark Ages, ancient Egypt or the the Chinese courts of the Emperor. The vibration of Matrix 5 will vibrate like a bell to get their attention. When I went into the Library recently, several people were there, saw me and said, \"there he is\". To that I responded, \"read the book - THAT'S important, not me\". With Matrix V Gold Edition in your possession, you now have the full set of keys on this key ring. You weren't pulled to buy it out of 'curiosity', although that may have been your conscious thought. You were pulled to obtain it through the promptings of YOUR Higher Self who requires shim's incarnation to distribute these keys to all of YOUR incarnations. 27"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge Internationa! Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Your current incarnation may only need some of these keys, but other incarnations will need different ones contained in these pages. If you are an Awakened Final incarnation, you will truly grasp the value of them more than any other incarnation that you have. Keep in mind that 'time' is not linear. What you do now with Matrix 5 does indeed benefit you in other 'time' periods. And there is NOTHING that the sequentials can do to prevent Matrix 5 from having its effects on you! Then may try to get you to stop reading it or pull you back into the Game bv getting you to discarding the book. Also you can, of course, decide not to follow through with what you have read in Matrix 5. but the effect of reading it has already benefited your more Advanced incarnations. Rely on YOUR Higher Self and tell the externals who want you to give your power to them to 'fuck off! Matrix V Gold Edition is unique. The path you have chose is unique to you. The experiences are chosen by you as your Higher Self. All this uniqueness is central to your being able to spiral out of the Game by successfully graduating. Hold on, though. What's coming next is even FAR more fascinating. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition The Higher Self I journeyed up the energy connection from within my physical. It has some similarity to the visual of passage between worlds shown in Stargate SG-i: a circular, brilliant tunnel. One passes up through this energy and emerges into the Higher Self. From within, I saw the Higher Self as opaque but glowing with natural energy. The oval shape has the image of each incarnation I am - the head of each, rows and rows of them. In the center of the 'floor' of my Higher Self is a pillar of energy topped by an energy shaped like a multi-faceted crystal globe. The energy pillar is where the impulses (memories, experiences, etc.) of each incarnation are centrally processed and stored. The globe is where access to any individual incarnation may be retrieved. The access to the Higher Self is possible for all Dominant and Final Incarnations. Before the Higher Self chose shim's path, the Higher Self wasn't an empty blank of energy. Not at all. The Higher Self has all memories before shim chose to incarnate. The Higher Self is a living ship, an intellect. Once the choice was made to incarnate in the 3rd density, the Higher Self chose experiences and disguised shimself in bodies to participate in the 3rd density learning process. As the Higher Self is the incarnation, shim learns from the experiences and changes accordingly. By the time the Final Incarnation is reached, the Higher Self is far more advanced than when shim decided to take the challenge. When the Final Incarnation is complete, the Final Incarnation IS the Higher Self minus the flaws contained within the Earth human body. In a later visit, I looked up and saw a circular energy vortex, which will eventually be the path for the completed Higher Self, under direction of the Final Incarnation, to move to the next major phase of progression in a higher density. This connection is not readily visible from outside the Higher Self as it is slightly out of phase, being of a higher density. While exploring some of my Higher Self, I followed some energy to a point in the Higher Self where I was given an access outside shim. From outside, the Higher Self looks similar to a layer cake-shaped (in shape, not size) oval with a luminescence. Extending from the 28"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"bottom are tendrils of energy, one for each incarnation on the 3rd density. The Higher Self is opaque from the outside as well. I quickly looked around and saw several other Higher Selves, all similar to mine, all with energy tendrils reaching into the 3rd and 4th densities. I'm sure everyone who reads this is familiar with the 'silver cord' attached to the incarnation. The 'silver cord' does not begin with the out-of-body you, but rather terminates AS you. This is the extension from the Higher Self. It passes through your physical body when you are astral journeying. It is this cord's contact with the physical that keeps it alive. The ‘silver cord’ is what you access to enter your Higher Self. By moving up this cord, you enter your Higher Self. Only you can do this for you. When this cord is snapped out of the body, the body dies. The cord never snaps from the incarnational you. However, once, after death of the body, your incarnation decides the time has come for something new, the energy is pulled back into the Higher Self with a small energy flash. This energy is under control of the Higher Self and AWAKENED Final Incarnation. It cannot be terminated in any way except from the Higher Self, the energy of all your incarnations. This also brings up a popular lie - “selling one's soul to the devil”. This is a total fabrication. First of all, there is NO devil and NO biblical god. 4th and 3rd density reptilians are the basis of the devil myths. While individual incarnations of the low through medium levels may misguidedly believe in the fictitious devil (part of the growing/experiencing process) and soul selling, these are features of the Game to keep you away from discovering who you really are. By overcoming the devil/god myths, you progress to a higher level of consciousness. Although individuals may believe that they have “sold their soul”, this is untrue as it could not be done. ONLY the Higher Self and, particularly, the Awakened Final Incarnation have control over the entire experience and the Awakened Final Incarnation is never taken in by such fables. This writing contains major information. It will be of immense value to Dominant and Final Incarnations. Sections of it will be significant to very Advanced incarnations. If you cannot handle the material, push the information aside. It has registered within your Higher Self just by your reading it. Time is almost up.

A Basic Comparison of Densities and Dimensions We live in the 3rd dimension of 3rd density Earth. The astral plane is the 4th density. Time/time travel occurs by using the 4th dimension. The need for technology is not of a higher density. From the 4th density (astral) on up, thought and will create whatever is needed. There is no need for wires, metals, fiber optics, fuel, etc. They are all 3rd density items. One can create objects, on the astral, from thought, and they appear like a house or whatever, but they are pure thought. With dimensions, technology is still in effect. Dimensions include parallel universes. Even the anti-matter universes can be considered as dimensions. Meier's DAL universe is one example. With sufficient technology, beings from different universes can interact with each other. 3rd density has many different dimensions. Technology is a 3rd density trait, no matter what phase of 3rd density. There is no need of technology beyond 3rd density.

Several alien groups involved in Earth's business are from different dimensions and have craft that can pass through these dimensions to reach here. All the dimensions have a connection to each other. Those of us with Higher Selves come from higher densities. The Higher Selves extend a segment of shim's essence to animate physical bodies for experiences. This is NOT done with technology, but with will. This is a complex comparison, but I hope I've explained the basic difference so you can understand the difference. Some incorrectly use dimension/density as interchangeable. Know there is a vast difference. The Sliders show illustrated dimensional travel. The movie Ghost dealt with density interaction. The more advanced your spirit progresses, the more matters will become clearer to you. Vibration of the Higher Self Each of the densities vibrates at a different rate. The individual Higher Selves' frequencies are higher than those of 3rd density. The physical body requires a spirit to give it life independent of the mother's womb. The higher vibration (frequency) causes fatigue in the body. True, the segment of the Higher Self that inhabits the physical body must express shimself through the many filters of the body (DNA codes), but the core, eternal energy that is the Higher Self remains the same and tires out the physical body. As the incarnations progress, the Higher Self shines through more and more and, in Very Advanced, Dominant and Final incarnations, the DNA sequencing (Orion tampering) is overridden to varying degrees with the Final Incarnation suppressing 85-90% of the Orion commands. This adds fatigue to the body requiring rest/sleep. If the Higher Self were to exert full energy, the physical body would be able to perform some amazing feats, such as teleportation by will (which is as common to the True You as breathing is to the physical you). This VERY rarely happens as our purposes here involve learning/experiencing and not dazzling the locals. As your spirit matures, the ‘sensational’ aspects, common to the spirit, become more evident and more matter-of-fact. This also means you choose NOT to go peeking into bedrooms from the astral. It seems those who wish to be voyeurs have a far more difficult time in learning to astral travel for this reason.

The crown chakra CONNECT is most important, though, as you seek to strengthen and increase the connection between incarnated spirit and the Higher Self for direction and assistance. Your Higher Self is the ONLY totally reliable source for you. Higher Densities- One Facet I finished re-reading Monroe's Ultimate Journey (I first read it 5 yrs ago). I've picked up a lot of info since the initial reading and have shared some of it with you in connection with this book. Monroe talks, near the end of the book, about going beyond the Park (level 27), WAY beyond, to an area he calls “the Aperture”. He sees how small he is to other beings there. He's also told he “doesn't have the Gift”. I've found that beyond focus level 27, every being you run into is so much larger, just as Monroe did. The key to why is that the higher levels (above 34/35) contain beings who have gathered all their incarnations below the Higher Self extension at level 34/35 ■ [Ed.- the 5 th density node of the Higher Self] Once all incarnations are recalled and the Higher Self of you on 34/35 departs, it is ALSO quite large as it contains all those incarnations you have been, all your costumes/masks and experiences. This is why the 5 th density and higher are populated by huge beings and why I am so small when I visit. I am only ONE of my incarnations, despite it being the Final one. After this incarnation is done with, I will gather all my incarnations and go to the higher levels arid will be as tall as they appear. This Higher Self of you on 34/35 is NOT the only Gathering Point for your Higher Self, but it is the lowest gathering point. If you are able to go within self and look up, you will see a connection to an even higher Gathering Point where you will add even more experiences tol There are several Gathering Points (my term) before the Higher Self is complete. The amount of 'time' it takes to reach this is staggering, BUT time does not exist beyond Earth 3rd dimension level. I hope you can understand what I'm telling you in this message. It's really neat to see your Higher Self on 34/35, to see all your incarnations within this Higher Self and to go beyond. It’s limitless and totally fascinating. [Ed.-See cover of Matrix V] Higher Self Improvement With Incarnations I had repeated some information, given to me by my Higher Self, about the cover art to Matrix V to the artist who so well captured what I've seen. He was surprised to find out that the Higher Selves \"cared in that way\". Your Higher Self is a composite of ALL of your incarnations from number one through the Final. Therefore, expressions of the Higher Self will be similar to what shim is use to receiving from shim's incarnations. The Higher Self IS your guardian. Who could guard you better than the real you? There are no guardian 'angels' as held by popular myths to be mainly winged, fairy-like beings created just for the purpose of watching over you. Think about it...a spirit being whose sole concern MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge Internationa! Research Group.

All Rights Reserved. is you and your activities. There is only one such being, your Higher Self! No god, no goddess...these artificial beings reside on the belief system levels and are created by their human believers. Only your Higher Self has a vested interest in all you do. When your Higher Self wishes to commune with you directly, shim will take on the guise of one of your other incarnations. You may be told 'your guide is Two Feathers, a Native American of the Mohawk tribe', but what you probably won’t realize is that Two Feathers is you in another incarnation. You may have some dead relative hanging around. This is more common in low and mid­ level incarnations. Most dead relatives don't hang around all that long because, free of their bodies, they eventually want to investigate their new surroundings and get on with their existences. Dead relatives will NOT be allowed to interfere with the Path of the Higher Self. You cannot live their lives and they cannot force you to live theirs. Not so with your Higher Self. You are always being monitored by shim. The Higher Self WILL intervene in your behalf if something external threatens the Plan of the Higher Self. Here's an example of my own on this: years ago (70's), I was driving on a lightly snowing day in Kentucky. There was no wind, but yet as I was driving up this large hill, I suddenly felt a shove on the passenger-front of the car and we went rolling down the mountain. I didn’t have a seat belt on but still felt a gentle force holding me in my seat as the car rolled down. Once it reached the bottom, I was able to easily open the door and get out. I had just filled the car with gas too, but no explosion or fire. The car was totaled, yet I had no injuries at all nor was I panicked. What caused my car to go over is one thing, but what matters is that my Higher Self was not about to let the un-awakened Final be done away with before the Mission even gets going. The Higher Self does allow misfortunes to happen. It's part of the learning/experiencing process . However shim will not allow polaric interference or a random event you have no control over to derail you from the main events you have chosen before incarnating. If you read Ultimate Journey, Monroe's Higher Self, in the guise of his Dominant incarnations, was around to watch over him in numerous occasions. Yet they were nowhere to be found when he was to experience things on his own. Your Higher Self can care for you more than you care for yourself, for shim is free of the Orion DNA programs and can see clearly. I've also seen where an incarnation strays from the intended Path and all kinds of ‘bad luck/misfortune’ seems to trail that person. This is the Higher Selfs way of trying to get you to review and alter your decision. Shim will not force you since it is your decision, but if you refuse to re-evaluate your decision due to Orion commands overriding, you can have a miserable life. Even so, you WILL learn from your error. You will learn responsibility for your decisions. You also can have a LOT of lives, as many as your Higher Self (YOU) would like. The Higher Self will not override your decision, but you will learn. How many times have you said, 'I wish I had known’ or 'I wish I hadn't made that decision'? Nevertheless, you did and you STILL learned and experienced. Higher Selves can also work together, on occasion, for a mutual Mission goal. This has occurred with Matrix V. My material would not have gotten all that far if not for Val's Leading Edge and his abilities. Matrix V needed a major key, which was the cover artwork. This is based on what I saw and crudely drew for Val, who enhanced it and passed it to the graphic artist, who enhanced it for the cover art. It reflects the memory I retain from my M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 32"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. experiences. Our artist, Arthur, was able to wonderfully depict what I have seen, but could not have done so without his Higher Self. For more on the cover artwork, see my comments on it at the beginning of Matrix V. Remember, YOU are immortal with all the abilities of an immortal being (despite ALL the limitations religion and society would like to place on you). You WILL come to your full potential after your Final mcarnatioJi is complete. Then you will look back on much of your incarnational experiences and smile at how there was so much opposition to you discovering your True Self. Your Higher Self will NEVER abandon you. Your Higher Self is the only being you can fully trust, not some non-existent mythological beings created to keep you from regaining your power. Push away the noise and the external. Know that you are loved and watched over by you, your Higher Self. Look within for who you REALLY are. Which Road Will You Choose? While there are many paths to progression, there are basically two types of roads - smooth and rocky. The smooth road is the easy way, but, by far the longest. It works on reassuring you of what you learned from religion, society, peers, etc., ‘is what's best for you’. The occasional ‘bump’ in that road is your Higher Self trying to get you to wake up. If the bump is big enough, it can push you onto a rockier road, at least temporarily. The rocky road is the harder way, but the shorter and far more rewarding way. The rocks on this road are caused BY religions, society, peers, etc. These are what challenge your Higher Self. These are what you must overcome to go higher and farther. Some of the rocks are religious beliefs, gender beliefs, social constrictions, others' opinions and your own insecurities. Victiinhood is represented by deep ruts in the road that you can fall into. In order to progress, you must overcome the rocks and avoid the ruts. Once you overcome certain rocks, you are not likely to have them fall in your path again to be of any concern. Take religion: once you recognize it for what it is and understand who you are, the rocks of religion will fall to either side of you, but not cause you to falter. The rocky road is always chosen by a Final Incarnation, never a smooth road. This doesn’t mean the Final Incarnation knows this from birth. It may, but usually later in life. Everyone’s different. However, when it does waken to its nature, it becomes evident that the rocky road is the ONLY road. Meanwhile, those on the smooth road see you and badger you to conform and ‘return to the smooth road' and ’be like us’. Another thing about the rocky road, once you've overcome the rocks and ruts, the road gets increasingly smooth and you wind up running instead of crawling. The rocky road widens at this point. What's beyond that is not for me to tell, it is for you to find out. The smooth road is a trap. While seemingly smooth at first, it becomes narrower with time, restricting what you can do, keeping you in bounds. You can switch roads. “Too rocky for me in this incarnation”, one may say and switch to the smooth road - enough for one incarnation. “No progress for me on this smooth road. I don't seem to be getting anywhere”, says another, and jumps to the rocky road, accepting the challenges. The choices are your own. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 33"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Final Blocks - External and Internal One person commented, in a question, on the loneliness he experiences as he increases his withdrawal from the Game. Loneliness is ONE of the signs that you are headed in the right direction on your path to spiraling out of the Game. In the section about 'Which path will you choose - Smooth or Rocky', I described both types of paths. As you near the end of the Rocky Road and the rocks (obstacles) are fewer and fewer, you find yourself with hardly anyone who wishes to be in your company. The phone rarely rings and you discover you do almost everything on your own. This is due to people, of a lower incarnational level than you, wanting to play the Game AND they see you have become so independent that they are uncomfortable around you. This discomfort is not only that you won't conform to the group, but also that your vibration has risen to where they just don't want to associate with you or keep meetings to a minimum. The isolation comes after a lengthy (depending on your situation) interaction of relatives, friends, co-workers, etc doing/saying whatever they can to drag you back into the Game. It can be difficult to pass these trials. Tears DO flow. If people like you for how you conform to their narrow standards, they never really liked you. If you continually stick to your spiraling guns, these people eventually fade even if some never give up on trying to drag you back. In your now very advancing state, it's time to connect with your Higher Self even more. Ask shim, \"What's next for me? Lead me to what I need to know, to experience or to whom I need to meet’. You must put complete faith in your Higher Self. This is just the opposite of what society teaches - external salvation vs. internal salvation. The loneliness is a test of your resolve. How much do you really want to progress and leave the Game? The rewards are spectacular but the conviction to reach the goal of End Game must be adhered to. External blocks - family, friends, co-workers, etc - are one problem, however internal blocks (DNA commands/immature spirit) are another matter. These DNA commands, placed in Earth humans by alien genetic scientists, are discussed elsewhere in these writings. The Final Incarnation must overcome these blocks, at least all major DNA commands, to finally depart the Game. The First Law of the Universe will not be denied in the higher densities. The Final Incarnation will learn that breeding, heterosexuality (‘I can only consider a person by their gender’) and more, are artificial and deny the spirit. As a Final Incarnation, these awakenings are NOT forced. Realization unfolds to the Final Incarnation as the Higher Self expands and deepens shim's connection to the incarnation. Yes, questions (internal) DO come up. The body's DNA commands don't just switch themselves off. The commands will flood your mind with ‘reasons why’ you should drop your desire to spiral out and rather how your should ‘find the opposite gender, breed and conform’. What will your family think? What will your friends think? And so on ... conform! [Ed.- The First Law of the Universe is the Law of Attraction, like attracts like. See the back of the book for more.] If the spirit is not mature enough, shim will cave in to these lies, although shim will eventually succeed in the Final Incarnation. The DNA commands will try and convince you to go back to sleep. This can work in ANY incarnation EXCEPT an AWAKENED Final MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Yon wouldn't be a Final Incarnation if you didn’t have the spiritual ability to subdue the prime DNA commands! Again, go to your Higher Self to draw the strength you need. At this stage, you most likely would like to connect with another Final Incarnation to discuss matters with, but the. optimum remains your Higher Self for ALL matters pertaining to you. Friendships & Polarity In Matrix 5, 1 discuss various forms of polarity on 3rd density Earth. One expression of polarity that many don't necessarily consider is in friendships. There is the Darksider 'friendship' where one's attitude is 'what can you do for me'. This is the one way, 'me only' orientation. We either know this type or have seen it demonstrated in film or television. This is a sadistic expression. The opposite is found in the Lightsider friendship. This is the 'I'm here for you no matter what you say or do to me'. This is the. masochistic style: Use me/abuse me...I'm here for whatever you wish. This type of 'friendship' is held up as some kind of icon of idealism. The only ones who say that have an interest in controlling others. It's also the 'misery loves company' pack. I recently heard from someone who I no longer care to associate because he expects me to play this masochistic role. He went so far as to quote David Icke, from one of his books, where David says 'everyone is to blame when there are disagreements even when someone else started it'. David believes that you ‘just being there’ is enough to qualify you to accept responsibility for someone else's experiential loop. That is NOT true and Lightsider bullshit. Anyone who thinks that line will work on me has no comprehension of Awakened Final Incarnations. When faced with this type of person, use the Law of Allowance and permit them to dally in the garden of guilt they've sown, BUT also separate yourself from the situation unless you, too, are caught in an experiential loop. Balanced individuals do not entertain these Dark/Light situations in a Final Incarnation level. You are helping someone to deal with their experiential loop when you remove yourself from their loop. This forces them to look within, i/they are Advanced enough. You are no longer there to feed their erroneous fantasy and take blame for THEIR flaws. Lightsiders will think that's 'horrible' to say. Lightsiders fear reality. Darksiders will grumble. They know that Dark cannot exist without Light. For each person that pulls out of the polarity game, that removes one Dark and one Light pawn. If you leaned to Light, by removing yourself from Light, balance corrects by removing one Dark. You should be able to see where this is headed by thinking over what I've just written. This is another reason why loneliness becomes more and more common in Very Advanced stages and is at its height in the Awakened Final Incarnation. You are separating yourself more and more from situations and persons who still want to play the Game. People who are nearing the final spiral out, want to put the Game behind them. Catering to people who want you to be responsible for THEIR flaws/experiential loops will hold YOU back from your progress. This is like the bucket of crabs where, when one tries to escape, the others pull him back down to be with them. It is very valid for you to examine people who claim to be your friends. Are they your true friends or using you to augment their experiential loops? Do they expect you to cater to them or for you to be their whipping post for their insecurities, jealousies or inner M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 35"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. bitterness? I told the person that I referred to above that “it's not that I'm mad at you. I'm not. It's that I don't want or need this vibration in my life today.” The Rocky Road is demonstrated here. The Smooth Road is so much easier. The choice is yours. Changes in You When you have made some serious (not minor) changes in your perception of life on Earth, your aura does change its vibration. This vibration is noticed by others, although they don't know why. It's just that you seem to ‘no longer fit’... and you DON'T. You are spiraling up and away from 3 rd density Earth. They are spiraling DOWN into the Dark plot, as described in the Handbooks. You will find you irritate them by no longer conforming. Minor quirks are tolerable, but you are vibrating to a new, higher reality, and they don't like it. If you find people going out of their way to be vile to you, ignoring you, talking about you behind your back or confronting you for seemingly minor things, don't worry. Take it as an indication you're proceeding as your Higher Self wants you to. It isn't easy. You WILL lose 'friends'. Of course if they ever REALLY were your friends, they would not be put off by the new you. You can lose 'family' (I lost ALL of them). This shows you that although blood may be thicker than water, spirit is stronger than blood for you are NOT your body. YOU are not your incarnation for it is the clothing you chose to wear in this lifetime, no more, no less. There are a few others (very few in relation to the population of the planet) who are experiencing what we are going through. They are scattered all over the planet. When the shift comes, all of the new vibrating beings will advance while those who resist REAL change, inner change, will get to continue this farcical Game. The thing is, once you've reached a certain level, although you can miss the company of those who've chosen not to associate with you any longer, it's not the emotional wanting most people associate with a loss. It's more of a 'well, that's too bad, but I gotta do what I gotta do' attitude. The more your Higher Self kicks in, the more the real YOU kicks in, the quicker you advance. It always pays to look forward, not backward. Let the dogs howl and snap at you. You're on the rocky road. Once you’ve come to a point on that road, the dogs can no longer try and hinder you. Emotions After watching the film, Little Buddha (excellent film), they show how overcoming your emotions, becoming separated from them, is one of the prime goals of Buddhism. They should have statues of Star Trek Vulcans next to Buddha as the Vulcans are the depiction of this goal. However, we are not here to separate from our emotions nor to be controlled by them. The ideal is to be in control of the emotions. Polarities exist in the emotional field as well. For example, Mediterranean Europeans are known for being ruled by their emotions. Examples: Greeks, Italians, Spanish always describe themselves as passionate (emotional) people and they let their emotions rule them. The opposite, little or no emotional feeling, is shown ideally by Vulcans, Buddhists, the British upper class, and the German upper class. Hmmm, lots of reptilian influence there. Remember, both are polarities. The goal should be to control the emotions and use them. There is overt joy in higher realms, for example. This would make Vulcans and emotion chastising Buddhists cringe. Passion is good, but you must be in control of it. The \"I can't help myself\" excuse is the body in control of the spirit. Yes, you can help yourself, but that spins into the victimhood lecture, and I've already taken you to that. Conclusion: Emotions are great. They are one of the main reasons we incarnate - to learn and to use and to control emotions. Mastery can MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 36"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. only come through incarnational experiences. There are those who try to artificially create emotions without the incarnational experience. They will fail. In Little Buddha, he hears 'if the instrument is strung too tightly, it will break; if it is strung too loosely, it cannot play'. Unfortunately, Buddha forgot that lesson in regard to emotions. It is easier to deny einotions than to control them. Emotional Fire (Special Gold Edition Segment) Emotional fire - the use of emotions to convey concepts - is something that is necessary in higher densities. Emotions are one of the main groups of experiences that we are in the 3rd density to learn. Through much of our incarnational streams, we learn what these potent emotions are and to experience them as they control us in Low through lower Advanced stages. By experiencing these emotions and their effect of controlling you, rather than you being in control, we learn much. The next stage of emotional experiences is one of attempting to stifle them in the name of 'control'. This is a feature that starts in Mid level incarnations and is the opposite polarity of emotions controlling you. Society doesn’t like the use of emotions unless they are Lightsider thrust only - joy, compassion and the Lightsider favorite of ‘denying yourself for others’, for example. The Darkside emotion of patriotism is encouraged in several countries but is epidemic in the US. Patriotism is a Darkside emotion since it is 'me first and what I want'. In Star Trek, the. Vulcan 'total control of emotions and denial of their benefit' is considered a ‘worthy goal’. It is not. The goal with emotions is to make them work for you. This is something that is appreciated and learned more and more in the latter stages of Very Advanced incarnations and mastered during your Final Incarnation. To use emotions to express yourself without letting the emotions control you is the goal. This use of what I call 'fire' seems to be a concept difficult to grasp by those who think that a sepia approach is 'mature'. Therefore, if you are not sepia in verbal color, you do not fit the society box. Exactly! It is the society box that you need to break free from. It is something that you WILL break free from, although it is something for your Final Incarnation to deal with in its final form. Just as with different examples given of Balance throughout Matrix 5, the Balance between being controlled by emotions or denying them is 'emotional fire'. This takes a LONG time to understand and put into practice, so don’t kick yourself if you just can't grasp it well. You will eventually be able to use emotions like a painter uses brushes and paints. Emotions give color and depth to your words. Printed matter/ e-mails are almost totally lacking in the ability to convey the exact emotion you wish to impart, hence print communications result in many misunderstandings. It is like trying to see the colors in a black and white picture. When you are on the astral and above, thought is the method of communication as well as auric colors. When you have mastered the ability to paint your communications with emotions, what a fantastic ‘rote’ you can transmit. It is no longer the two-dimensional communication, but rather a multi-dimensional one with full enhancements. THIS is what I call emotional fire. I have run into difficulties with other incarnations comprehending the emotional fire concept. This is probably mainly because they are still under the society box limitations. I MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 37"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. will admit that it has only been relatively recent for me to understand this fascinating concept myself. I will tell you that once you do grasp it, you will wonder how you ever got along without it. You will need this ability in higher-than-5th density experiences. It is vital to proceed on your path to Advancement. Until you can understand the emotional fire level, you view expressions of it as ‘emotions controlling the person’ because all you currently understand is the polarity of emotions. To overcome the polaric uses of emotions, you must blend both polarities to form Balance. In this blend, you do see elements of both Dark and Light uses of emotion but the adept can see the differences in their use. I can use this and it shakes up an incarnation, yet I can't go back to the society box. That tends to increase the feelings of being alone. Emotional fire is just so amazing. Some people I know get flustered by my use of it and respond negatively or mystified. I, on the other hand, can only sigh in response because they cannot yet understand. Emotional fire is waiting for all simultaneously incarnating. It will prove invaluable to you when your Higher Self moves into higher densities. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Emotional Fire II (Special Gold Edition Segment) In the Gold Edition segment, Emotional Fire I gave you some insights I experienced triggered by the Swan Lake classic recording by Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra (1963 recording). In this special bonus segment, I will give you even more to consider. I put this cd on my surround sound system (Feb 03), turned out the light and waited to see if there was anything else I needed to discover from the expertly crafted, one-of-a-kind artistry. In Act IV, track 14 - Final Scene, I was able to experience something that just took my breath away. It contains the musical codes that duplicate the process of the Final Incarnation summoning back all of that Higher Selfs incarnational streams ! I could see myself standing by the Nexus of Time and manipulating the facets of the crystal. My actions were smooth and quick. I definitely knew what I was doing. The sounds of the orchestra vividly depicted the return of the hundreds and hundreds of energy streams and fading of the incarnational images within the Higher Self as each stream returned to the source. As the last group returned, the Nexus of Time merged back into the lower portion of the Higher Self, the music significantly changed and I saw the ascent of the Higher Self as shim moved slowly, at first, up and out of phase away from the 3rd density Game and to fantastically new experiences. The musical conclusion of the track coincided with the departure of the Higher Self from 5th density. [Ed.- see Nexus of Time, segment #24] I was SO taken by this unexpected visual accompaniment to this track and had some powerful reactions to it. I almost didn't listen to the whole cd but strongly felt that I need to listen to all of it. I was richly rewarded beyond what I could have expected! It is no coincidence that this track is titled: Final Scene. It most definitely is. I do suggest that anyone who is trying to connect with their Higher Self use this cd as a meditation technique. You don't need to do anything special with it other than turn off the lights and relax. Let the sound work on you. It really must be this version of Swan Lake.

If you are meant to have it, you will discover where to get it. This departure from the 3rd density Game calls for the use of Emotional Fire and the will of the Final Incarnation to merge all incarnational segments back into the real YOU. If you listen to the cd, do it from the start so it can work on you in a measured way. Jumping only to track 14 will not be the same if taken independently. Final Scene, gee, what a night this was for me. Defining Incarnational Levels It is necessary for you to have a clearer explanation of the incarnational levels used in these materials. A low level incarnation does NOT mean 'bad' or having a negative connotation. Low level incarnations deal with basic 3rd density experiences. Low levels are totally body- oriented. Some of these experiences include sex, basic physical needs, subsistence levels, fear-based religions, basic polarity functions and 'me' centered. Low levels, while very basic, are necessary to build mid-level experiences on. With progression, low levels are subdued and tailored to fit mid and Advanced level needs. Mid-level incarnations occur gradually as the Higher Selfs needs become more complex and shim desires greater experiences. Mid-levels learn from others, act in groups and look for conformity and traditions. There is fear of treading away from the group, of being 'different'. While religion does move from fear-based to tradition-oriented during the mid­ levels. Mid-levels will ignore spirituality for the false, anti-spirituality of religion. Mid­ levels remain deaf to who they really are and prefer to give their power away, as in low levels, to non-existent deities and aliens posing as deities. Mid-levels prime concerns are families, work, and genealogies (being their physical body's line). They greatly resist any changes to their routines that do not enhance their false beliefs. They ARE their bodies. Everyone else's opinions have great effect on them. Mid-levels start their transitions into Advanced levels when belief in religion waivers and the limits of marriage begin to strain on them. They dip their toes into psychic realms. Tarot readings and astrology are 2 of the most popular routes into psychic realms. Once familiar and accepting of these systems and the world of the psychic, the percentage of Advanced begins to cause mid and low levels to decline with that individual Higher Self. The psychic and the spiritual become increasingly interesting to this transitional incarnation and curiosities become greater. While you will always have a percentage of low and mid level experiences continue through the Final Incarnation, the level tag refers to the AMOUNT of each level in ANY incarnation at any specific time. These can also alter during any incarnation. They also remain fixed during most low and mid-levels because true progression is for Advanced levels. If you are 98% low and 1% mid, that incarnation is considered low level. If you are 53% mid and 47% low, you are a mid level incarnation. 5% low, 35% mid and 60% Advanced is Advanced level. You can see why it takes hundreds and hundreds of incarnations to proceed from 100% low to Final level. [Ed-See illustrations at the end of the material, for examples.] An EXAMPLE of a Final Incarnation may be 4% low, 9% mid and 87% Advanced, the Final Incarnation also has a Mission unique to the Plan of that Higher Self which incarnated AND MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Once the Final Incarnation has ended, the Final becomes the completed Higher Self and then departs to a higher density as a single, complete being for new, vastly different experiences. Awakened Finals have no belief in any sort of religion (neither old nor New Age) although they may before their Awakening. The restlessness experienced by a Final in Awakening can send them into deep research on religions/belief systems searching for Truth. Once they realize that NO religion has the Truths necessary to progress, a spirituality emerges that only that person's Higher Self can show to the incarnation. Running with the spiritual thread given by the Higher Self, the incarnation Awakens and looks at the world around shimself with new eyes, seeing the Game for what it is and desiring not to play any of the Game that is not necessary. Power is not given away, but reclaimed. Finals know the only 'god' is their own Higher Self, the true YOU. Many alien DNA commands weaken and fall, but the spirit still must pass through the filters of the human body. The Higher Self doesn't reach FULL potential until the Final Incarnation has died, thus releasing the Higher Self and permanently freeing shim from the physical. The long journey through 3rd density is over. The more Advanced the incarnation, the more shim lives what shim gleans to be true. Very Advanced incarnations never say, \"I know that's true, but can't live it because of my family, friends, spouse (or whatever)\". This, of course, is the Victim mode. The Very Advanced LIVE what they know as best they can and never take on the victim role with what they know (such as 'my ball & chain just wouldn’t understand'). You can move 2 steps forward and 1 step back throughout your incarnational cycle. You can also move 2 steps up and 3 steps back. This is commonly seen in mid-levels who have a furious interest in the occult, then become frightened (due to alien DNA programming)/peer pressures and 'find jesus'. They toss out ALL they've learned from Advanced stages and run back fully into mid-level. This is part of that Higher Selfs experiences. They will eventually gain the courage to progress, even if not in that particular incarnation. Even though they chose to retreat, once they've dabbled in the occult/psychic, they WILL advance to learn who they are and act accordingly. Progression of Incarnations Low incarnations are those when the spirit is totally body ruled. The Higher Self chooses all genders and sexual orientations for the experiences of just being them. The Higher Self sets very few parameters for these basic incarnations. As with Monroe’s incarnations, some of his stated low levels were to be born in the US (early 20th century), as a woman (Africa), and as an aggressive man (warrior). Time, as you can see from this, was of no consequence. Low incarnations are just this - basic experiences. As basic experiences add to the Higher Selfs experience pool, the parameters are increased. No longer is it sufficient JUST to be born in a certain location or gender, the desire is for even more set experiences. Breeding is rampant in low and mid-level incarnations. This is part of the process. Low incarnations are self-oriented and surrender to 3rd density 'higher authorities'. Religion becomes the opiate of the masses during low incarnations due to fears of non-existent, but believed-to-be- existent deities. Polarities (Light & Dark) pull for allegiances here. Low levels tend to be the foot soldiers of polarities.

All Rights Reserved. Mid-level incarnations become more involved. Society's demands are significant to this level. Conformity sets in. Self-oriented is blended in with society demands. Mid-level is very concerned with others' opinions. Mid-levels seek conformity. Religious conformity is continued due to traditions more than blind fear belief. Mid-levels love to say how they keep up religious traditions. Fear of non-existent deities still continues, but more on the surface than deeply held. Even though in twilight years, mid-levels return to religion strongly, it's to hedge bets on what might follow impending incarnational ending. Mid­ levels tend to thrive on restrictions and traditions. Many, in this era, long for the 1950’s, an illusionary period of tradition. Southern states white Americans, however, long for the 1850's! When the Higher Self tires of the boring routine of mid-level incarnations (this WILL happen as the Higher Self is easily bored), and the spirit strains against the alien DNA commands in the physical body, there is a pull to explore the psychic and other densities. This is far easier to ease into by choosing a series of female incarnations for this transition since the psychic left brain is most active in a female body. The female experiences into the psychic world allow the spirit to RE-familiarize shimself with the REAL you and the REAL worlds of higher densities. After becoming familiar with aspects of the psychic, the Higher Self will insist on using the more powerful male incarnations. This may start out as gay incarnations since in gay bodies, certain alien DNA commands are shorted out and allow left brain to function equal with right. Once an advanced enough spirit is comfortable, male bodies are incarnated into advanced states. After this, the Higher Self will choose incarnations for shimself, riot based on gender, but on a growing list of parameters. Traditional religions are discarded with advancement. Spiritual religions have their pull - wicca, for example. As the spirit advances, though, shim realizes that NO religion will do as they are all artificial controls that give away power to non-existent gods/goddesses. When this is realized and firmly grasped, the incarnation moves into Very Advanced states. Dominant incarnations (every Higher Self has 3 or 4 of them) are always Advanced incarnations, usually Very Advanced. The Higher Self sets these incarnations for specific purposes to bring certain traits into the Final Incarnation. Dominant incarnations have limited access to the Higher Self AND do meet in the Higher Self in order to compose the Final Incarnation. If a Dominant incarnation is very psychic oriented, this incarnation will have much input. With a minimally psychic Dominant incarnation, the concern is not so great to that incarnation since shim knows what input the incarnation has that the Final needs and will be given. Dominant incarnations will carefully watch over the Final Incarnation until the Final becomes Awakened to who shim is. Once the Awakening has occurred, the Dominants have finished their prime purposes. Final Incarnations are the “omega” of 3rd density experiences. Finals have total access to all of the Higher Selfs incarnations. Remember, ALL incarnations of that individual Higher Self are YOU - Low, mid and Advanced incarnations are all you at different stages. These personalities are never lost. You do grow out of them, however. By the time you've reached Final Incarnation, your thoughts are constantly drawn to what is to come as you know you are wrapping up a LONG process here in 3rd density. 41"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. When the Final incarnation is finished, all incarnations from all time periods are simultaneously ended and their energies are pulled back into the Higher Self. The only one that remains active is the unique Final Incarnation. Once complete within the Higher Self, the improved, educated, experienced you moves to new experiences and VASTLY new locations. The journey of hundreds and hundreds of incarnations is over, BUT a new journey begins that will make the former one pale in comparison ! This piece has nut-shelled the incarnational transitions. Note that there is MUCH more to the process than I've given you. Note also that your Higher Self decides your Path and plan. You should not judge yourself based on the progress or assumed progress of others. This is not a competition nor a race. Everyone will 'win'. Everyone will succeed. Be happy being you! A Look At Advanced Levels (Special Gold Edition Segment) The more your incarnations develop spiritually, the closer they get to spiraling out of the Game. Low and Mid level traits have been covered in other segments. Much incarnational time is spent in these 2 levels for the basic, Earther experiences needed in other densities. The complex levels and learnings come in the Advanced levels and there are several distinctions to each of them. Low Advanced levels are those with a curiosity into the spiritual. Note, that is 'spiritual' and not 'religious'. Organized religious conformity belongs to the Low and the Mid levels. The main feature of low Advanced is an active curiosity into topics forbidden by the organized religions of the Low and Mid stages of incarnation. Low Advanced have an interest in psychic related matters and will ask questions about them with genuine interest. What is different about this level and higher Advanced is that this level does not really have any interest in personal development of their psychic talents. They can occasionally visit a tarot reader or astrologer or may not go beyond intellectual curiosity. Low Advanced are continually torn between these developing interests and the deceptions of the Game in regard to belief systems. The low Advanced can identify themselves as a member of any organized religion, but in name only. They rarely, if ever, go to church. They can also identify themselves as atheists. This is part of the restlessness of the spirit and a need for change and progression. Low Advanced is the start of breaking away from the Game and spiraling out of the Game. There are loosely organized/solitary religions that are part of the upper lower Advanced/lower mid-Advanced levels. Wicca and paganism are the most prominent. These belief systems have psychic development interwoven with their ancient beliefs of respect for nature and their one rule: As long as you don't harm anyone else, including yourself, do what you will. This is a combination step away from all organized religious beliefs, one godder religions that are in place to attempt to keep you away from spiritual development. These levels no longer claim any connection to the Game's organized religions, but yet they are not yet ready to move into higher Advancement that needs no type of religion. These low Advanced religions have strong thrusts into learning predictive methods and developing other psychic talents. While they encourage individuality, they still give away their power to external deities. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 42"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. The organized religions of the Low and Mid levels despise these religions. Those who manipulate the masses with organized religions know that these religions lead you away from their false beliefs and assist you in finding your Higher Self. The use of the control word 'sin' is extremely popular by those seeking to control you. A sin is anything that you do that offends the control of the church. Sin, like karma, does not exist except if you believe it. Sin can be thought of as another word for independent experience. In the Mid-Advanced levels, one decides that they have had enough of the transitory solitary/loosely organized religions. They have served their purpose in your progression. This may take several incarnations, but you are moving forward now and will not be held back. The reason why so many female iricarnations exist in the mid-Advanced levels is due to the female physical being more adaptable to learning the basics of psychic development. The incarnating spirits do better in psychic learning in female bodies. There are male incarnations in the mid-Advanced levels as well. These are also more Advanced spirits who will progress from mid to Very Advanced levels in one incarnation in most cases. When the Higher Selfs incarnations have learned what is needed in psychic development via th e female vehicle, shim is then ready to merge the core learning from the female with the superior creative power of the male physical. While there are both males and females in the Very Advanced levels, the male physical is most formidable when occupied by a Very Advanced or Final incarnating spirit. It is a step up to move one's psychic learning into a male body. If you have difficulty with that, you are still body ID'd and see the body as more important than the spirit. The Very Advanced stages learn psychic talents easily. This is due to them having been successful in learning them in other lives during the mid-Advanced levels. Discovery and reliance on your Higher Self is a characteristic of the Very Advanced level. Some, at this level, are quite adept at the psychic arts. Others choose to have different experiences. The Very Advanced levels are where there is a tremendous amount of exploration/discovery in preparation, for your Final Incarnation. The discoveries of your Very Advanced are directed, by the Dominant Incarnations, into the Final Incarnation for Awakening. Observations: The Concept of \"Final incarnation\" from a Cultural Perspective When you look at the phrase 'final incarnation’ used from the perspective of the less than Very Advanced incarnation, they seem to be referring to a ‘linear’ incarnation. In THAT respect, EVERYONE alive today IS a 'final' incarnation as this artificial time line will end shortly. One Light-sider website has members who appear paranoid about whether or not their current incarnation ‘is Final or not’ (incarnational ego in play), that their moderator, who was exposed to Matrix V material, says he's ‘a final incarnation’ because “he will have no more incarnations in this time stream”. When you are of a linear mentality and when you haven't advanced enough to grasp the higher concepts, you have to grasp straws wherever you can. However, there is a massive difference between the final incarnation in a linear time line and the Awakened Final Incarnation of one's Higher Self. So, if it makes anyone feel good to say they are a final incarnation, unless you can answer certain specific questions only an Awakened Final could know, you must be referring to the end of linear, 3rd density time. There ARE un-awakened Finals out there in the world, but MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 43"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"it's up to their Higher Self so trigger that Awakening. IF any of you are in that position, know you can't force the time. If you are a Final, you WILL be Awakened by your Higher Self via your Dominant incarnations. Meanwhile, just enjoy being who you are and making the most out of your incarnational life. Observations: Higher Self Tests - Pass or Fail ONLY There are SO many people I know of who like to say how 'advanced' they are in the spiritual sense. They join those who say they are 'final' incarnations just because I talk about them. I’ve been listening to this hot air ever since I started getting the material ready for Matrix 5. I know a few people in my area (who know I'm The Author) who also claim to be a 'final' and 'very advanced'. (Note, I'm using small case letters on that for a reason). Enter The Event of 9/11. I've never seen such crash & burn, knees knocking and teeth chattering before FROM these people who use to say how 'final' and 'advanced' they are. It seems almost everything they claim they learned was tossed out of the window. One even has the nerve to say she's still 'so advanced' but lapsed into flag wearing, physical ID and all the trappings of a mid-level. The deception is not to me, but to her. As I've said before, your Higher Self will see you are placed in situations where you will be tested AS AN INCARNATION as a wake up call. When you say you are something, or are NOT, the truth will be known and then you will have to face that truth. Here I've been expecting to hear from a couple of these 'final' and 'advanced' people and instead, not a peep out of them. I can hear the knees knocking & teeth chattering from the general areas of where they live. The probable thought being: 'if this came true after he warned it a month ago, what else may come true'. I knew it was ALL wind from these people long ago. It's EASY to say you are something, but a whole other thing when actions are required to back up the verbal bravado. There are a few who seem to have done quite well with the Event of September 11th. Others have gone into hiding. Don't EVEN ask me who you are. I'm NOT your judge, but my observations are very valid. You are where you are. Tests given by your Higher Self, as part of the Game progression, are Pass or Fail only, NO in-between. These tests are not for anyone else's evaluation nor anyone else's Higher Self evaluation. They ARE for your Higher Self to evaluate the status of that individual incarnation to determine what else this incarnation may need to experience or realize about shimself. Those who have passed the first tests of The Event will move on to another level and will be tested again as The Event progresses on. Those who failed the first tests of The Event will have to re-evaluate their own positions on where they are and ARE NOT. If re-evaluation proceeds well, the incarnation can move on to other tests with a better understanding of who they are and, more importantly, who they are NOT.

Tests & The Higher Self Your Higher Self will test shim's incarnation for spiritual progression/Advancement. This is to see how the incarnation is faring over the body DNA commands. For the most part, the body has control in Low and Mid-level incarnations. This is for the pure experiences needed to develop. Once you move/begin to dabble in the lower Advanced levels, your Higher Self will put, what I call, those 'forks in the road' to see which path you will choose within your incarnational Path. Depending on your choice, you can have relatively smooth sailing or be peppered with all kinds of difficulties. If you made a decision and you can't ever seem to get out of the problems (consequences) of that decision, your Higher Self is watching to see if shim's incarnation has the spiritual fortitude to overcome the body's will. When you make the spiritually based decision, rewards await your Advancement. Your Higher Self allows freedom of choice here as learning experiences. You won't make a choice that will cancel any experience that your Higher Self requires, but there is plenty of latitude in 'other' experiences. The more Advanced you become is due to how you handled decisions for your incarnation. You WILL, for example, have to experience being BOTH polarities. Without those experiences, you won't appreciate Balance. THERE IS NO WRONG DECISION, as such, BECAUSE you will STILL learn even if you choose the fork in the road peppered with problems. It's just going to take you longer to learn. An incarnation that chooses the problem-laden path can still switch to the other fork. The switch made, in that case, requires a stronger spirit tempered BY the consequences of shim's original decision. Once you've TRULY learned from your errors or from following your spirit, you will Advance to YOUR next level. The more Advanced you become, the more different the tests become. You can have a test in the Mid-Advanced levels that would have been impossible for a Low Advanced level, but now you're at a level that can handle it BECAUSE you have passed lesser tests in the Low Advanced levels! Once you've overcome the body command of marriage, any future tests of that would be society-generated and not Higher Self generated. Once you've progressed that far with confidence, you can tell society to 'fuck off! The more Advanced you get, especially into the Very Advanced levels, the more alone you can feel you are getting. People don't want to be around you because you don't vibrate at their slower rate. I have talked about this in Matrix V. Now, a Final Incarnation will have different tests specific to a Final. These seem to revolve around the Laws of the Universe. For me, the Law of Allowance has been a common testing. I had a major test of this a couple weeks ago and passed it well. Why all these, tests? To prepare you, who IS your Higher Self for higher densities. What you learn here will have you ready to function well in these higher densities. You have mastered the 3rd density, especially as an Earther simultaneous Higher Self. I watched the last 1/2 hour of Contact tonight. When Jodie Foster's character gets to the alien planet, she asks the alien what the next step is. Now, her character is dead common Mid level, BUT still an Earther Higher Self. What the alien says is that her journey is but a M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 45"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. step and they \"move slowly\" so Earthers will ‘have to wait for the next step’. That is SO sequential! He tells her \"that's the way we’ve been doing it for BILLIONS of years\". Yeah, and the sequential incarnating Higher Selves will STILL be doing it for BILLIONS of years after the Earther Higher Selves have graduated. THAT should tell you something. Embrace the tests as events to demonstrate where you are. Your maturity shows through when you show you can alter decisions made in error. You don’t fail tests in the way you might think. They are ALL experiences that we learn from. This should give you a lot to think about. Tests & The Higher Self - Part II In the original message I stated how the incarnation faces 'forks in the road' of shim's Path. These forks in the road are part of the testing done by that incarnation’s Higher Self. These are tests of spiritual progression. Depending on the level of Advancement, the incarnation will choose one of the two forks. Fork examples: should I marry this person or should I not; should I take this job or move across the country; and should-1 stay in a terrible relationship or end it. IF the chosen fork indicates spiritual growth (incarnational spirit subdues body ID), the incarnation will progress to new levels. IF the chosen fork indicates body ID over spirit, the incarnation is peppered with difficulties because of the choice. Body ID choices in Low and Mid level incarnations are expected and required, but once you enter lower Advanced levels, it is time to proceed to spiral out and spirit over body ID. The constant difficulties are not the end of the matter in the body ID type of choice. The Higher Self WANTS the incarnation to learn and to choose better. These forks are viewed as body ID fork vs. spirit fork, but YOU would have to figure out which one is which when faced with these decisions. This ability to discern these forks for what they are comes during Very Advanced stages. If the body ID fork is chosen by an incarnation that is expected to spiritually Advance, not only is the incarnate faced with numerous, seemingly unending difficulties due to that choice, but that incarnation's Higher Self will assist the incarnation by presenting alternatives to the present situation with expectations that the spirit will recognize this, subdue the body ID AND change the original choice made. Once the body ID choice is made, you have consequences (spouse/kids/commitments of whatever sort) and in order to switch to spirit path, you will need considerable strength of spirit to accomplish the change BUT you CAN do it IF you want. These alternatives may come to you as someone in your life showing you another way to proceed, something you read that wakes you up to your error or even enough pressure on the incarnation that the spirit overwhelms the body ID with 'enough is enough'. You are NEVER left alone by your Higher Self, who wants you to only succeed, but it's succeeding on the progression of spirit that counts. Your Higher Self will continue to nudge you hoping you make the right choice for YOU. The more Advanced you become, the MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition 46"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. stronger the spirit becomes and the more Higher Self driven you become. Subjugation of the body ID by at least 85% is necessary to spiral out, as I discuss in Matrix 5. Obstacles Caused by Faulty Decisions I've discussed those life-changing 'forks in the road’ that we all come to, several times in our incarnational lives, in other M5 materials. Depending on which of the roads you CHOOSE, a series of experiences and consequences will descend on you. These major decisions in your life are well marked and can be of a myriad of options. Here are just a few: -Should I get married -Should I move in with this person -Should I go to college -Should I enter the military -Should I get a divorce -Should I trust in myself -Should I accept this job -Should I move -Should I quit myjob -Should I ....... By these choices I DON'T mean simple choices like, 'should I have chicken or steak'. The choices I DO mean will cause your life to take on a new track with all the accompanying experiences. The more Advanced you become, the more important your decisions will be. It MAY be necessary, for example, to go to college or to join the military because you will meet someone critical to your Path. BUT, if you decide not to do something, other experiences and consequences will be attracted to you. So, how do you know if you made the right choice FOR YOU? If you did, most of your experiences will be of a growing nature and obstacles/negative events will not plague you. I am simplifying this, but if you're here, you should understand what I mean. As I said elsewhere, your Higher Self allows the incarnation to make decisions/choices that do not halt or permanently disable the Plan of experiences your Higher Self requires via that incarnation. If you made a choice that doesn't suit your main Path, you are peppered with problem/difficulty after problem/difficulty. These can be put to you BY your Higher Self who is attempting to get you to change your life. IF you have Advanced enough spiritually, you will recognize you should be elsewhere/doing something else, etc and make a new decision/choice having learned some valuable lessons from the error. Was the choice wrong for you? Yes AND no. Yes because it was a difficult, cyclical experience that you have had before and DO NOT NEED TO CONTINUE IN EXPERIENCE ANY LONGER. No, if you CHOOSE to stay in this type of loop, giving the body control over the spirit. If you can break the experiential loop, the spirit exerts control over the body. I'm talking mid- Advanced progression levels here. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 47"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"If you are a low or a mid level incarnation, experiential loops are necessary for experiences and spiritual growth. It's in the Advanced stages that you start breaking these loops. The more Advanced you are, the more loops you conclude your ride on and, hence the fewer loops you will have remaining as you progress in the Very Advanced stages. So, you've made a decision that is loaded with heavy consequences, numerous problems and you are at a level where you enjoy Matrix 5. That makes you somewhere in the Advanced levels of progression. It is very likely that YOUR Higher Self is peppering you with problems (the ass kick) to try and get you to do something about a situation that you've OUTGROWN and will RETARD your progression in this incarnation. You have to take these things up with your Higher Self. I'm asked for my opinions on various situations and I give them with the intention that the person can save a LOT of misery. Almost always my advice to these people is totally ignored. They always come back with different versions of 'you were right'. Now, that's ok IF they learn from the experience, make NEW decisions and end the cycle. It tells me they needed the pain to break the experiential cycle. What gets me is when they realize the decision is in error but refuse to break the cycle. They seem to have become addicted to the experiential Zoop and become the masochist to the sadistic experience. If they respond with, \"I had no choice\" or any variation of that, they have not progressed enough to see through that lame excuse. Water the root of the problem with your tears of self pity, as I've said before as well. Examine vour difficult life situations. If they are burdening you with constant problems, break the cycle and take a different fork in YOUR road. Suffering is a Light-sider belief. If you are in a comfortable situation, don't become complacent for progression thrives on changes and I guarantee they will come. Your Higher Self will present you with new forks in the road which indicate it's time for something new. DON'T overanalyze the forks in the road. I remember when I said I was going to relocate here, there & everywhere except one location, yet when I graduated college it was that one location that I wound up in. My Higher Self saw to it and I didn't try to analyze or pro/con the choice. I just did it. If I hadn't made that MAJOR decision, I would not be where I am today. However Final Incarnations are in a class all by themselves. Once again I counsel you to hobnob with your Higher Self, the real you. Go with the flows and throw off heavily hard experiences.

All Rights Reserved. 48"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Obstacles Caused by Faulty Decisions: Part II In this segment, I will give you some examples of correct fork-in-your-path decisions. This example is common to EVERY Higher Self incarnation SEVERAL times in your TOTAL incarnational cycle: ‘the happy marriage’. These are the all-too-rare today marriages of 2 people that ‘remain happy with each other for the entire marriage’ (till death do we part stuff). They have some kids who are a credit to their incarnational level. It's the Ozzie & Harriet type of situation of the early half of the last century. You have (out of your hundreds & hundreds of incarnations) numerous versions of this as part of your progression cycle and it fits the area/time period you are in. This is common in the low and mid level incarnations. You basically obey your Orion DNA commands to breed and your Higher Self has much to learn from the experiences here. This is correct for you AT THIS TIME in your Path. Once you've remained in this loop numerous times, it becomes comfortable and the spirit will begin to break the cycle. Incarnations become (usually unconsciously) bored with this mold of conformity and problems start, due to progression and straining to grow in the spirit. The search for the 'ideal' marriage of other incarnations , after you have outgrown the spiritual need for this bondage, results in divorces and multiple marriages. Other problems occur as bitter fruits of the dead incarnational experiential loop - sneaking around with others, escapist tendencies, power plays between partners and so on. You CANNOT go backward. You MUST progress. These problems will continue AND increase until the spirit learns to overpower the body's DNA commands for marriage and breeding to serve the alien overlords. Breaking the experiential loop needs courage and will, as it very well may be difficult. IF you are true to yourself, you do alter your path regardless of the multitude of controls/power plays the partner (ball & chain) will attempt to use to hold you back. Love does NOT mean control. IF both partners are ready to advance, the divorce will be amicable. IF one is moving ahead spiritually and the other is stuck in their own loop not ready to move on, then you must fight for your soul. You WILL win and you will learn powerful lessons if your spirit has decided 'enough is enough'. The sad part is that when someone breaks this pattern, the loop is not totally broken until the incarnation demonstrates that shim does not need to repeat the cycle by finding a new opposite gender, which will bring other problems and the loop continues. In Advanced levels, the need to be in the company of like-minded people increases with the rate of Advancement. In the VERY Advanced levels, you have little tolerance to be surrounded by anyone not moving similarly to you and sex (with others) for sex alone loses its luster rapidly. Nearing the end of the Earther incarnational cycle, you shun marriage but MAY decide to live with someone who is moving similarly as you are. What happens in the Final Incarnation (Awakened) will be made known to you when you reach that stage in whatever 'time period' YOUR Final Incarnation is residing. Other examples of experiential loops that must be experienced AND be broken are: religion, patriotism, nationalism, genderism, Lightsider clinging, Darksider clinging, racism and many more.

The Nexus of Time (Special Gold Edition Segment) While watching television, my Higher Self decided it was time for me to receive a rote (bundle of information) while I was watching an interesting program. You just never know when or where your Higher Self may endow you with information. I instantly stopped watching TV and was wrapped up in the informational rote that came with full detail and color. After receiving it, I knew far more about this subject than I did previously. The information deals with the multi-faceted orb on the pedestal-like device inside a Higher Self undergoing the Game experience. This includes ANY Higher Self in the Game. Refer to the cover of Matrix 5. Look within the Higher Self diagram and see the orb on the pedestal. This is what my informational rote describes in more detail than I knew before. When the artist rendered his excellent artwork for Matrix 5's cover, it was as best as could be at the time. It is not completely accurate. The orb/pedestal in the Higher Self is not as tall as it looks. The pedestal is actually short. You could stand next to the orb and it would only be chest high on a 6' tall person. The orb itself is quite large and has a facet on it for each of your Higher Selfs incarnations in 3rd density. Since I've had over 1600 incarnations, there are over 1600 facets on my Higher Selfs orb. As I've said in previous segments, English is a very poor language to describe many things I've experiences and seen. The orb/pedestal is another that English does not have the proper words for. For lack of anything better, I was told the orb/pedestal is referred to as the \"Nexus of Time\". Time does not exist as we know it in 3rd density, but there isn't a proper word to use in its place for this, so Nexus of Time will do. The orb is the connector for the Higher Self to extend shimself into whatever 'time period' that the Higher Self desires to incarnate. The orb is the link to each incarnation and directs incoming experiences/information to the Higher Selfs memory. A Final Incarnation is given, when ready/necessary, the information concerning that Higher Selfs orb and the instruction needed to operate it properly. I now know this and, I must say, that I've always known it since my Higher Self is me. The information is now in my conscious mind. I can't say why I needed to know that now, but I do. Each orb facet is created by the Higher Selfs energy. The energy stream originates from the Higher Self and forms a Y shape at the base of the pedestal. One arm of the Y energy moves up the pedestal and forms one facet of the orb. The other arm of the Y extends into the physical body of the incarnation. This arm moves under the bottom of the Higher Self until the energy finds the correct vibration portal to enter a particular \"time period\". When this portal is reached, the energy streams downward from the Higher Self, as per the Matrix 5 cover artwork. The Y energy shapes build up in the pedestal, one Y on top of another Y. These form the pedestal itself. If you saw your Higher Self from below, but still on the same density as the Higher Self resides, you would see how complex and organized the energy streams are when they emanate from the central base of the Higher Self. The artwork, although wonderful, cannot really show all the wonders in appearance of the Real You. When that Higher Selfs Final Incarnation has completed the 3rd density experience, the Final, from within the Higher Self, summons back all the other incarnations.

As the energy streams return, the Y energy form for each incarnation pulls back into the Higher Self and the facet is no longer there. Once all the incarnations have returned, the orb/pedestal is no longer there, the purpose for them having been completed. The energy streams below the Higher Self are, obviously, no longer there. When this is complete, the Final Incarnation merges with the Higher Self and becomes the complete Higher Self with all memories/experiences for ALL shim's incarnation complete. At this moment, the Higher Self becomes You and You advance to the next stage of your progression. You will know what to do and where You can go. You will advance to a vastly new level and form another Higher Self for other experiences that I won't cover here. This is quite Advanced material in this segment. If you cannot handle it, don't be concerned, for at some 'time' your Final incarnation will find the information- invaluable. Just by reading this, and other Matrix 5 segments, you have added the information to your own Higher Selfs memories. What is coming for each Higher Self is amazing. Just wait until you see. Dominants & the Final Incarnation (Special Gold Edition Segment) The Final Incarnation, as I've written in previous segments, is the central incarnation of each Higher Selfs simultaneous experience. This is the culmination of all 3rd density Game play. The Dominant Incarnations are 3 or 4 very significant incarnations for that Higher Self. These incarnations distinguish themselves on their chosen path. They are connected with the breaking of major experiential loops, such as religion. The personalities of the Dominants are wide and varied. There is no standard in that area. When I was introduced to 2 of mine, one is extremely psychic while another is not at all. The psychic Dominant is very formal and no nonsense. She occupies a Chinese physical of hundreds of years ago and is basically a 'lady in waiting' to the Empress. When I went to China in 2002, I was able to learn more about some of her facets independently of asking her. There is no doubt that she is the dominant of the Dominants with my Higher Self. The other one of the 2 is a lot of fun, existing in mid-i9th century England. She listened while my Chinese Dominant spoke to me then said with a big smile, \"Yeah, you got your psychic abilities from her but you got your joy out of life from me\". This incarnation is married with 3 children. I visited her home, saw her husband and children. On the surface, it seems like a very average/common life for the time and location. This is her setting. Her reason for being a Dominant is something else. My 3 Dominants (I will not discuss the 3rd one here) met within our Higher Self and decided what traits would be necessary for the Final (me). As with all Finals, significant traits of each Dominant are instilled in the Final. I've mentioned two traits, but one that my Chinese Dominant insisted upon was all the information dealing with females. The English Dominant agreed. They did not want the Final to fall for the manipulations that they knew females in my time period would excel in.They also chose my time and place of birth using what was astrologically appropriate for my position of Final.

All Rights Reserved. considerations, but due to the Dominants needing to be at a certain stage of their own incarnations before they create the Final, the Final Incarnation is, at first, slightly out of phase with the other simultaneous incarnations of that Higher Self. Once the Dominants have agreed on the composition of the Final and the energy is placed in the Nexus of Time, the Final begins and the phase difference is ended. The Final is now part of the simultaneous path. Your Dominants are the 'guides' of the Final Incarnation until the Final is Awakened. They will see that no one on any density will inhibit the Final from Awakening even if it calls for direct intervention. There are certain rules of the Game that apply ONLY to Final Incarnations, a pre-award for reaching personal EndGame. A shaman, who I later learned was Darkside, tried to remove an 'implant' that he saw in me. Neither he nor I knew at the time that this was a special connection from me to my Dominants. He said that each time he reached for it that some 'glowing figures' kept him away from it by relocating it. Once I met my Dominants during a Monroe Institute program, my Awakening had moved into the latter stages. This is when I told my story to Bob Monroe and he said, \"Not only are you correct but I know who you are\". He never did explain further and he left me standing there, silent. My Dominants were available for advising at first, but now they defer to me in my position as Final. Each Higher Selfs Dominants will be unique to that Higher Self. My story should be looked at as an example and only an example. Remember, each path is unique and individual. Consult with your Higher Self for information on YOU. Dominant & Final Incarnations & Experiential Loops (Special Gold Edition Segment) The subject of experiential loops has been covered in other segments, but there is one more issue about them that I want to share with the readers of Matrix 5. Overcoming most of these loops is the goal of each Higher Self via the incarnations that shim chooses. The loops are part of the Game and part of the flaws of being in a 3rd density body. Most loops are experiences and once your spirit has decided that 'enough is enough', you strive to discard them through the several Advanced stages of your path. There are many major and minor experiential loops. Some of the major loops include: religion and the massive amount of minor sub-loops of religion, body identity, sexual identities, living for others whims, destructive habits (drugs, alcohol, smoking, etc), nationality and so on. Some of the minor loops are: following popular trends (what to wear, say/not say,etc), huge amounts of following the dictates of others and giving away of your power in repetitive, minor ways when you really don't wish to. Each of these is open to individual interpretation according to the needs/requirements of YOUR Higher Self. Religion has always been a particularly nasty loop. It isn't until the Advanced stages where your spirit has had experiences enough to make shim strain under the artificial bonds/demands created by a non-existent god (aliens) and those who desire to keep you under control. The start of breaking this loop usually starts with restlessness and examining the beliefs of that religion, then a search for a belief system that makes you feel more comfortable. This restlessness will last for many lives until you finally recognize that ALL MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 52"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"religion is a lie. This usually occurs in the upper-mid Advanced or lower Very Advanced stages. It is successful in your Dominant Incarnations and part of the reason why they are your Dominants. Now here is a bit of information that I found most interesting - the Final Incarnation, when the Awakening begins for shim, can experience religion from being very orthodox when young to the Awakening of who shim really is, all in the space of part of that single lifetime. This occurs when the Dominants want their Final to briefly experience religion in all its stages. While it can seem frustrating immediately after the fact, 'why did I have to waste those years with the mormons (or baptists, buddhists, muslims, wiccans, etc)?' is the initial question. Rest assured that there definitely IS a reason which will become clear as the Awakening progresses. The breaking of the religious major loop has already occurred but the Dominants decided that it was very important for their Final to have personal, current time experience(s) so that the Final's observational abilities will be far sharper in certain vital areas. This, again, is decided by each individual Higher Selfs Dominant Incarnations. The experiences that other Higher Selves choose may well be significantly different. With my Final Incarnation, drugs, alcohol and smoking were never issues. These loops were broken by me in other incarnations. This experiential group is a proven interference in spiritual growth/development. While I can have a drink or glass of wine, that would be it. I have never been drunk in this incarnation nor have ever seen the need for it, BUT the things I have observed in those still stuck in that loop are noted. Don't think of what I just said as anything but an observation on my part. If these are still your loops, that is where you are. You will eventually move beyond them, even if not in this incarnation. While it is not necessary for you to have overcome all loops by your Final Incarnations departure, there are several key loops that absolutely must be broken for one to succeed in the Game. Religion is a major one. Body ID is another. Substance dependency is another. The first one denies who you really are and has you give away your power. The second one also denies who you really are by making you accept the lie that you are your body. The third one wraps your spirit in chains and can place you in a Neptunian fog of stagnation hoping that this will keep you away from knowing who your really are. [Ed.- See also segment Drugs and The Game for more on this.] There are more major loops, but you need to go within yourself and discover what they are for you. If you find a loop had been relatively easy to overcome in your current incarnation or you have no desire to participate in that loop now, it is because the hardest work in overcoming them has already been performed by you in other incarnations. You now reap the reward for your trials in other times. You cannot have all loops overcome because you still have a physical body. This is why around 85% overcoming is very good by Final Incarnation's conclusion. You will have broken all major loops by then. Your Dominants will assist your Final Incarnation and guide your steps through Awakening. Trust in yourself is something I've been saying over and over throughout Matrix 5. It is only when you do this can you find and follow the Rocky Road. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Awakening, Anxiety & DNA Commands (Special Gold Edition Segment) When you are first getting up after a long night's sleep, it usually takes a person a while to become fully awake. The same is true for someone in the Advanced stages of progression. It takes a while to become Awakened. It is not until your Final Incarnation that is it possible to be totally Awakened. This is by design and is something all simultaneous Higher Selves are working toward. While you are in the long Awakening process, you will find yourself in conflict with your body's DNA commands. 'Yourself refers to your spirit. Depending on how Advanced you are, your control over the physical is demonstrated. I am very aware that many of the topics I have written about in the Matrix 5 materials have made most people (to varying degrees) nervous and unsettled. GOOD! These feelings are caused BY your body's DNA command structure as it senses you are moving contrary to how the body’s alien masters have instructed. Here are a few of the topics that will cause unease in the not-yet-Awakened: ^Females - The current thrust by American and other Western females for domination over males is Orion Empire instigated. This is like a cat wanting to become a dog, a tree wanting to become a fish and so on. The purpose of the female gender (from the simultaneous point of view) was to have a totally different experience than the male, not to have an equal experience. This 'same experience' idea is sequentially incarnating trait and seeks to undo the simultaneously incarnating path. The current female problem is one of the most serious threats to the simultaneously incarnating path on Earth today. On the other hand, it is one of the most important features of the Orion Empire and the sequentials' objective in the Game. It is vital to be aware of this problem and understand what is behind it. You cannot escape the Game and graduate to higher matters until you are aware of this problem and your body has overcome the alien DNA commands to ‘serve the female’. Anyone who is uncomfortable with this topic is still struggling with their body's control. That is YOUR problem to work out. This is a powerful control and may not be overcome until your Awakened Final Incarnation. *The concepts that 'good' is not necessarily 'good' and 'evil' is not necessarily 'evil'. The polarity bullshit is either one or the other with both opposites considering themselves 'good' and the other as 'evil'. The American government has been a ‘war criminal government’ in the Iraq situation since the early 90's when the American ambassador gave Iraq the ok to invade Kuwait, then the American government turned on them for doing what they ok'd. America is becoming a fascist state. America calls itself 'good'. It is not. 'Good' and 'evil' are relative terms. They are not absolute. Overcoming the deception of the polarities is another major goal of the spirit in order to escape from the Game and move into higher realms. If you cannot see the players for what they are AND continue to buy into their deceptions, you are not yet Awakened. America is currently a major evil in the world today. ^Religion is another alien control device to inhibit spiritual growth. ALL organized religions have aliens sneaking around somewhere to attempt to derail simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves. Religion is another major incarnational event for the spirit to overcome. Religion steals your power away and demands you surrender your power to it. The abandoning of religion is yet another goal of the Awakening incarnation. 54"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"These 3 are just some examples of what must be overcome to depart the Game and win successfully. Do they make you uncomfortable but yet you still want to know more? The uncomfortable feeling is your DNA commands to obey. The desire to know more is your spirit calling. This is YOUR internal battle and one only you can win. The good news is that you eventually will win with your Awakened Final Incarnation. Questions and The Game While I have written much on a lot of Game topics in the Matrix 5 materials, you may find it interesting to take it one step further by asking questions, not only of other’s you are comfortable with, but also of yourself (if the question applies). By doing this, you can gauge, to a certain extent, what your participation in the Game is with these issues. These questions encompass basic low incarnations on up. Consider: *Why do you feel that you have to/had to get married? This is a good question to see if THEY understand why they do this. I've found that responses heavily favor other people's expectations/controls/conformity. Follow up: why marriage and not just living together? The answer is body ID controls, hence Orion Empire and alien genetic scientists. It's definitely not a spirit thing as marriage is non-existent outside of 3rd density. I talked with one man who said he didn't want to get married but his family \"expects\" it of him. I said he was conforming. He said he knows it, isn't happy with it, but will do it. Mid-level incarnate. *Why do you feel that you have to be romantically/sexually linked to the opposite gender ? Make them think about this. Everyone who engages in this activity does it because they're expected to. It used to be drilled into everyone that this is \"normal\". It's what \"everyone\" does. Again, others' expectations/controls/conformity. If it's a spirit based attraction, the physical shouldn't matter. The controls of body are physical controls. Sex is the top of that heap. I warned one man, from his horoscope, that his marriage to this woman was going to be hell on Earth. He got mad and said, \"If I don’t marry this one, I’ll marry someone else, but I will get married.\" I could hear the applause from Mintaka. By the way, I was right with this guy - both he and her are miserable with each other. *Why do you feel that you have to have children? The alien DNA command 'want sex’ is one of the commands in this area. The 'have sex' command is not for fun but rather is strongly under the control of it’s twin DNA command to ’have sex to produce children’. This is the command from the alien throne. This second command has weakened considerably over the years, as one can see in today's environment compared to just 100 years ago. This is due to the immense energy field ofEarther Higher Self incarnates. The weakening DNA command structure is partially behind the return of the Orion Empire, as I have stated in earlier segments. Hence all the religious prohibitions in regard to sex. We all have to go through this major phase in progression and it's part of low and mid level incarnations. When you get into Advanced stages, ask why do you feel you have to have children when the world has far too many people on it already (and you'll most likely bring in another minion these days)? Don't expect them to give you an answer that makes sense. Most likely they'll just get flustered as the body has no valid responses for this other than conformity-related, stock phrases. *Ok, you did the marriage thing once, why do you feel you need to keep repeating the cycle?

All Rights Reserved. 55"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. This is a real kicker. It's the experiential loop in full force. The ‘marriage of the moment’ so popular in Hollywood and mimicked by countless other people. The huzband of the month club so popular with many gays. Why don't they work? They are sex based, first of all. When the sex gets routine, it gets boring. Unless two people are moving in similar directions, it won't work. Those involved are looking in the wrong places for internal, spiritual restlessness. Restlessness that shows itself in physical frustrations. The spirit must exert shimself, through maturity, to break this experiential loop. *Why do you stay with that person when you are both so miserable? This, again, is the experiential loop with a heavy dose of self-doubt and lack of self-reliance/esteem. The weak woman wails, 'who will take care of me'. Geez, talk about an incarnational dead end. Take care of yourself. Minions love to use this phrase a lot, especially if they had lives as cows, chickens and other barnyard animals where someone always took care of them. Control/conformity issues again fit in. To progress you have to take a personal leap of faith. Faith in yourself, your Higher Self. The minion incarnation will eventually return to the good, old barnyard. *Why do you dislike other races (fill in the blank for this depending on who you're talking with/about)? Dislike of other races is body ID and was placed in there by alien genetic scientists. Remember, in previous segments I wrote how other aliens meddled with Earthers after the Orion/Sirian genetic scientists did their thing. When these aliens tampered with their interest areas of the globe, they instilled their dislikes of other alien groups to those Earthers. These dislikes are heightened due to reptilian features of the Earther human brain. When the spirit has matured enough to override the body in this area, you learn to judge people by WHO they are and not WHAT body they occupy at the moment. The mid- Advanced and higher have no time for people who are at the stages where the body is in such control. Yes, we all go through this stage in earlier incarnations, but just because we were in second grade once doesn’t mean we hang out with second graders after we are well beyond that stage. What is really non-spiritual is a comment like: she can't be a fung-shui professional because she's not Asian or he can't be a real shaman because he isn't Native American. Undoubtedly this person, in another frequency incarnation, is this race or that race where specialty trainings exist. This is carried through into other incarnations in the mid-Advanced stages and above. Talk about a dim comment I was told: I asked a Native American traditional about reincarnation and if someone, non-Native American, knew he/she had lives as, say Lakota or Cherokee (or whatever tribe). His response was 'if that was so, how come he/she is not one today?'. That response is typical of a sequential incarnation. The sequential incarnates DO incarnate that way. Ah ha! *Why do you do what everybody else does in (whatever) matter? This is a big conformity/please others issue that low and mid levels love to wallow in. This is body ID. The Empire demands conformity. It's those damned Advanced spirits that throw sand in the engine of the Empire. They are forever challenging conformity and questioning obedience to the will of the Empire. The often used, CONFORMITY demanding question of: 'if everyone jumped off a bridge (or something similar), would you?'. This is an attempt to bring you back into line. Both Lightsiders and Darksiders use this, but Lightsiders do it with relish. This is meant to keep one from straying out of the box of imposed rules. You cannot Advance as long as you stay in the box. These are just a few questions you can make with the information I've given you about the Game. You can compose many more. It's good to ask them, with people you are comfortable with. It gets them to think and self-examine. Most likely they will be flustered by the MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 56"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"question and want to give a standard, Empire approved response. However it will register with their spirit and may also get them thinking about why. You just might be pointing them to an escape hatch. Not opening it for them, for they can only do that themselves. Remember not to be obnoxious with these kinds of questions either. Don't be a missionary. You can't save anyone else but yourself. With that in mind, have an interesting time, but start with questioning yourself first. Observations: The Higher Self and What No One Can Do For You There are people out there who are now claiming that they can speak for someone else's Higher Self. NO ONE CAN SPEAK FOR ANYONE ELSE'S HIGHER SELF. Your Higher Self does interact with other incarnations throughout the incarnational experience. Higher Selves do communicate with each other on the density level they occupy. However anyone who sets themselves up as a ‘channel for other people’s Higher Selves’ is not valid. They are being manipulated by lower astral entities. Another thing to consider is people who look for external sources for contacting their Higher Selves. One of the main themes of Matrix 5 is to go within and reject external power takers. If your current incarnation believes shim cannot contact shim's Higher Self, that person will never contact the Higher Self by asking another to do it for shim. This is also another indication of someone not being satisfied with where they are in their progression. Actually your Higher Self DOES communicate with the incarnation and watches over each incarnation's development. This is your TRUE guardian, not some mythical 'angels'. When I first Awoke, I tried to take 2 different people to their Higher Selves. I was only able to take them to the entry into their Higher Self when, in both cases, I saw they had their 'eyes' closed and were acting like sleepwalkers. I discovered that these incarnations were. NOT permitted to have this ability at that time. Both were totally unaware of the experience (eyes closed). You cannot force Advancement. Only Dominant and Final Incarnations can have access INSIDE the Higher Self, although various Advanced incarnations may be able to see Higher Selves from without. Remember, even if the incarnation reading this cannot access their Higher Self from within, YOU HAVE INCARNATIONS IN OTHER TIME PERIODS THAT DO. Don't give away your power to those who say they can talk for YOUR Higher Self. It's a trap and a waste even if it’s free. The drug pusher gives you your first fix for free too. The lure here is to keep coming back to this person (no matter how well meaning the person is) for more 'advice'. I can't talk for anyone else’s Higher Self. All I can share with you is my experiences and discoveries which you are free to dismiss or accept, which is of no concern to me, but be on guard for those who are setting a snare for you by saying they can channel your Higher Self.

All Rights Reserved. Guides and the Higher Self In chapter 12 of Monroe's Ultimate Journey, he talks about the conversation he had WITHIN himself with his Higher Self and combined other incarnations. They come right out and tell him that 'they' watch over him and assist him. This is also what I've discovered. The 'guides' and 'angels' that we all hear so much about are really different aspects of your Higher Self and NOT strangers who suddenly ‘decide’ to hang around you. That strangers would do that never made sense to me. Don't they have anything better to do? Yet, our Higher Selves have a distinct interest in seeing how each incarnation develops and progresses, from the earliest on to the dominant one. This means, of course, your Higher Self is ALWAYS with you, is ALWAYS available for you to consult with and will NEVER leave you! It directs the re-channeling of fears and absorbs/processes information and emotions. There is FAR more to this, but each person has to develop to the stage where he or she is able to access the Higher Self at will. Monroe told my group how to connect to the Higher Self. I was the only one who tried and succeeded. No one else even bothered to try! If you knew what I knew, you'd know why I laugh at troubles and fears, hope the Earth flips or the aliens invade. IT DOESN'T MATTER! When I do soul retrievals and tell people about their 'guide', this ‘guide’ is really an extension of their Higher Self. I know of no other shaman who would tell you this. As far as I know, they all think it’s “some wandering spirit with no life in the astral”! Ah, well ... I hope this makes you think! The Phrase “In my last incarnation’’ As I wrote a while back, Higher Selves incarnating on Earth have simultaneous incarnations while those Higher Selves who choose to incarnate on other planets have sequential incarnations. Simultaneous incarnations occur in all frequencies (time periods) that the individual Higher Self desires experiences and growth. These experiences and memories flood into the Higher Self and are needed, in varying degrees, by Advanced, Dominant and, especially, Final Incarnations. The main idea of this brief writing is connected to the often heard phrase: \"in my last incarnation...\". Since all Earth human incarnations are simultaneous, how can you accurately refer to your 'last incarnation'? What is tagged as your previous incarnation is actually the incarnation in closest frequency (time period) to your own. I've spoken to a few who were born after World War II, for example, but have strong intuitive ties to the War period as different players on that stage. Another example is a man born in the 50's but has strong ties to the American Civil War. For him it’s the incarnation closest in frequency to his current incarnation, hence it is his ’last incarnation' in a manner of speaking. This ‘closest’ incarnation does not reflect on the stage of advancement of your current incarnation. You could be a Dominant, but the closest incarnation may be of mid, low or any other level than your current incarnation. It is not necessary for you to place a ‘value judgment’ on your ‘closest’ incarnation. It has a part to play in your journey and is, after all, you. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 58"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Higher Self Individuality You all have seen the cover of Matrix 5 and the appearance of the Higher Selves. Each Higher Self has hundreds and hundreds of incarnations simultaneously, but they (on that higher density) all appear the same when you look at the artwork. Just as each incarnation is individual for that Higher Self, so is each Higher Self different from all others. The massive amounts of experiences pouring into each of these immortal beings alters their vibrations. It is by these vibrations that each Higher Self forms into a unique personage. These vibrations are easily distinguishable by other Higher Selves. So, while they may look the same by the cover art, they are anything but the same. This enhancement continues throughout your Higher Selves' progressions. At the conclusion of a Higher Selfs Final Incarnation on 3rd density Earth, all the energy strands (incarnations) are reintegrated into that Higher Self and shim moves on to bigger and better experiences. The vibration that Higher Self now has includes the rare and special vibration of Earther 'graduate'. Shim has the perfect ability of recognizing others as the individuals they are, even though that ability does not translate well in the incarnations due to the alien flaws. Each individual incarnation & that incarnation's experiences add to the overall nature of that Higher Self. This can all seem a bit complicated to you, but be assured that it will all be obvious to you when you are ready in your Final Incarnation. Be Satisfied Being You - Incarnational Levels Since I discovered, at the Monroe Institute, that I am in my Final incarnation, everyone I’ve told that to is suddenly “in their Final incarnation”, typical of the “follow-the-leader” American fashion. Because of that trend, I will describe Dominant, Final and other incarnations to you to help you understand the differences, at least to a certain degree. I’ve had over 1600 incarnations. All but 4 of them were basic (low, mid-level and advanced) incarnations, both Light and Dark, gaining Earth experiences and storing them in my Higher Self. These other incarnations can be from super basic early incarnations up to advanced incarnations with specialty areas. Only you can discover how many incarnations you have had, because only you can access your Higher Self consciously. Somewhere in the incarnation experience, my Higher Self decided it was time for a Dominant incarnation. You can have 2 or 3 of these. These go beyond the Advanced incarnations, being a blend of several points of past incarnation to form an individual Dominant. One of my Dominants dealt with psychic ability and development. One other dealt with a sense of humor needed for Higher Realms. My other Dominant I will say nothing about. Only you can discover your Dominant incarnations. They will interact with you within your Higher Self. Your Final incarnation is a blend of all your Dominant incarnations plus a fair amount of ‘spice’ from your other incarnations. While you may be born knowing you are the Final incarnation (on 3 rd density Earth), it is almost guaranteed to be suppressed by family and society until you rediscover it later in life. Dominant incarnations are unique to you and have abilities of discernment not present in any other kind of incarnation. Dominant incarnations, once consciously recognized as such, have control over the physical’s DNA MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

All Rights Reserved. flaws installed by the meddlers. For example, an awakened, knowing Final incarnation does NOT say, “I need/have to have (the opposite gender).” Dominant incarnations can live together in male/female relationships. Final incarnations know the destructive energies in the opposite gender placed there by the meddlers. Final incarnations will not allow themselves to be surrounded continually by these vibrations. Yes, you can be in Final in either gender, but you recognize the flaws of the physical and willingly adapt to them to serve the spirit. This is why in the chaos, I will not allow any females to be in my group nor any male who ‘needs’ a woman. You have to find your own groups. Once you reach Final incarnation, you’ll understand why. This has NOTHING to do with physical sex. The Dominant incarnation, once aware, does not bed hop, but understands the real meaning of sex as energy transfer and an assist to growth of the other spirit. Even though gays/lesbians don’t have the flaw of heterosexuality, they misuse the physical blessing by “searching for the right person”, not knowing or wanting to know that their physical makes it easier for the spirit to express itself. BUT if the spirit is not advanced enough, it will use the physical in these cases strictly for pleasure experiences, but still remain urisettled. Once the Final incarnation is aware of its nature, even though it doesn’t necessarily know its purpose, things change. This is described, to a certain degree, in The Handbook Vol. 1 & 2. The desire for sex alone is suppressed and the need “to be with someone who vibrates to your spirit or close to it” becomes far more important. You know the folly of control (marriage) and related issues. You eventually know that the opposite gender physical is destructive to you your purpose. (You won’t understand why UNTIL you’re in a Final incarnation AND have progressed enough to handle it). A Final incarnation can get married before awakening, however once awakened will realize the error of it and why it is an error. BUT, as I told one who has come to this point, it was an experience. Now you know it, as long as you don’t get caught up in that cycle, you’ll spiral out and away to higher matters. A Final incarnation can start out as a Christian, wiccan, muslim or whatever, but is unsettled by the limitations as the spirit tries to awaken. Final incarnations, when learning there is an escape, do not go back. They can still have flaws to work on: victimhood, smoking, alcohol or whatever, but they know they have to work on it AND take steps to correct it. A Final incarnation will not be exposed to the Higher material and shun it to follow a lower path. For example, one man I know was exposed to a fair amount of higher, but he turned against it to marry some female he had nothing in common with. Even if he had lots in common with, if he were a Final incarnation, it wouldn’t have happened. He may be a Dominant incarnation or an Advanced, but not a Final. That gives you some idea of levels of incarnation. Now to my real point: Be happy with who and what you are, whether Advanced or Dominant incarnation. There is a purpose and reason you are getting material I share here. Lower and mid-level incarnations will not be bothered with it. Dominant incarnations can absorb parts of it in preparation for contributing to your Final incarnation. So, you’re married. That’s your experience, and make the most of it. It doesn’t mean it’s “wrong” for you. We’ve ALL had to go through that ‘curse’ many times in different roles. It’s where you are today. My advice and comments give you something to consider. I will not try to ‘convince’ you of anything. Final MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 60"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"incarnations KNOW. I will not try to ‘argue’ any point. If you don’t like it, forget it. That’s fine with me. Final incarnation information here represents points for consideration - you find out for yourself if it’s comfortable with you, so PLEASE be happy with your status. You wouldn’t get this type of info unless you were an Advanced, a Dominant or a Final incarnation. One thing about Finals too, we generate new information,-new to this level. Incarnating Paths and Higher Self Individuality (Special Gold Edition Segment) In earlier Matrix 5 segments, the wide variety of experiences and the individual nature of each Higher Self has been mentioned. This cannot be emphasized enough. Conformity is a hallmark of the sequentially incarnating Higher Selves. It is an anathema to the simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves. Alien planets progress as a unit. The aliens have admitted this to their contactees in many instances. The aliens are all close to being at the same level of Advancement according to their race. This does not mean that the oldest races are the most Advanced spiritually. Quite the contrary, it seems. The oldest race in our galaxy is reptilian. They are the most technologically advanced and the least spiritually Advanced. This is their race's choice and will likely mean that the oldest race will be the last one to complete the Game. This shows that the reptilians will be the last race in the galaxy as the others will have departed for higher realms. The Game WILL end. These Higher Selves chose this extremely slow path of Advancement. Third density is not eternal. Enter exploding suns and black holes to clean up the mess. Game over! As for the fast track, simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves, we choose to Advance individually rather than collectively. This is VERY important. In the higher densities, it is the individual abilities that shine. We learn to do it on our own. On Earth, there has always been an attempt to work as a 'team', to be as 'one'. This is an alien influence in trying to mess with our parts in the Game. Simultaneous Higher Selves have adapted to this meddling by having their incarnations work as a team/group in Low, Mid and Low-Mid Advanced levels. What this does is give you a significant experience as working with/for others in order to build your data bases and experiences to find out what works and doesn't work for you so that you can move beyond teams and be an individual. This individuality is eternal even when all Higher Selves merge into one. In order to have harmony, you must be complete as an individual. That is difficult to grasp while still in the Game. The simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves are the first to complete and depart the Game even though we Earthers were the last to start it. In the Mid Advanced levels, you begin to want to separate from the teams/groups. You start to strike out on your own and develop your individuality apart from any group. In these EndGame days, the stress to conform is far greater as the aliens and their lackeys pull Earth more and more into a sequential path. Notice the conformity/obedience that comes from governments/society/religion. They are all alien thought dominated. They want to make Earth like any other sequentially incarnated planet. Individuality is where you must be to move to higher densities beyond the Game. By individuality, I don't mean the Darkside \"it's all about me\" shit, but rather the Balance way of \"I am whole unto myself/I can do it myself'.

All Rights Reserved. 61"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"In latter stages of Advancement, the desire is to break away from the team/groups and become more reclusive. This doesn't mean a hermit, but does mean you become far choosier in associations. This is another clue that you approach your own part of EndGame. This can manifest as disgust with the Game and the loss of interest in conforming to any way you are not comfortable with. With knowledge and spiritual control over alien DNA commands, this desire does increase. Search where you are in your progression. There are no correct answers. You are where you are. Do you prefer group activities or individual activities (you alone or with one other)? Do you crave team sports/body enhancements or mental/spiritual knowledge? Are you a body centric person or one who wants to develop the eternal/what you take with you on the death of the body? If you are body ID'd, the good news is that state is temporary and you will abandon it starting with a Mid-Advanced incarnation which will snowball all the way through your Awakened Final Incarnation. As far as each individual Higher Self, their unique nature is absolute. The Dominant Incarnations of one Higher Self are very different from the Dominant Incarnations of another. Being very familiar with my Dominants, I find them very confident and strong. Yet, I read of another Higher Selfs Dominants who appear very differently. They do not seem nearly as confident as my own (from my perspective) and try to ‘hedge their bets’ in creating a Final Incarnation. You must remember to approach your Higher Self on your own terms. What I have written about mine strictly applies to me. They are not universal, other than each Higher Self has 3-4 Dominant Incarnations, as Robert Monroe said. While this is true, the composition of these Dominant Incarnations is unique to each Higher Self. How each Higher Self chooses shim’s Dominants is not something I can talk about at this time. The bottom line is to trust in YOUR Higher Self, which is, of course, the real YOU. Trusting in your Higher Self will be a reward unto its own. Awakening I've used the word 'awakening' numerous times in the Matrix 5 materials and specific to the Awakened Final Incarnation. Awakening is a process. It is NOT an instantaneous action like flipping a light switch. The awakening process that I refer to happens in stages. The first stage is when the incarnated spirit moves from mid level incarnations and makes lower Advanced stages a significant part of shim's Earther life. This can occur, for example, when the predictive sciences (astrology, tarot, etc) gain and hold an interest for the person. Even if the person regresses back into common mid level, the touch of lower Advanced has altered the person and will continue to build on the spirit in other incarnations. It is the body that yanks the not-yet-mature spirit back into mid level, usually with the 'assistance' of other Game players (relatives, friends, co-workers ,etc) using guilt, fears and non­ conformity as weapons. There are many other examples you can probably think of where the spirit tests the Game and shim’s development by reaching beyond the standards acceptable to Game players. From this, you can see the general awakening is a long process involving hundreds of incarnations. Progress is made. Progress is slow, but it is still progress. The next significant stage of awakening comes during mid-Advanced levels of progression. Religion is still, in most cases, a factor in mid-Advanced levels: New Age religions, wicca, Lightsiders and other similar polarity-oriented beliefs, although standard Game religions are abandoned by mid-Advanced level. It is when the spirit feels that ALL religion is 'not right' and there MUST be more that you are near the Final Incarnation.

The restless nature stems from the spirit, BUT the spirit MUST break the incarnational loop (see my Matrix 5 segment on breaking this loop). You will not be able to break these loops if your spirit is not Advanced enough to make the bold choices necessary to progress. This can also take several incarnations, but by now, spiritual progress is Advancing rapidly and the body is losing control of shim. GOOD! Dominant incarnations are a category all their own. In my case, one is Very Advanced, one is mid level and one is in a unique category. My Very Advanced is conscious of her role as coordinating Dominant due to her extremely Advanced psychic abilities. Yet my mid level Dominant is not conscious of her role, finds amusement in the psychic incarnation's serious nature and views the Dominant function as a dream. It is what each of the 3 or 4 Dominant incarnations offer to create the Final Incarnation that is important. The Final is the combination of segments of these Dominants which makes a totally new incarnation. You will understand all this and more WHEN you are ready to. Lastly there's the Final Incarnation. This incarnation is not likely to be born Awakened, but shim does complete the Awakening process. The un-awakened Final can temporarily engage in mid level religions by being brought up in them. The spirit is restless early and by teen or 20's can trash upbringing standards to ’see what's out there'. Religions that shim is brought up in or dabbles in can be quickly dropped when the incarnation sees no progress, nothing new, but desires something shim cannot put shim's finger on...yet. The search for truth/the source is strong and will lead you along YOUR path to seek the experiences that YOU need. Then comes the time when the un-awakened Final is met by the 3 or 4 Dominant incarnations. When this happens, you have now reached the BEGINNING of Awakened status. It's a whole new area and it takes time to process the huge amounts of information you will be given, not all of which will you consciously remember. It will take years, but variations occur with each individual Final Incarnation. The Awakening Final becomes the Awakened Final by a series of events that the Dominants set for the Final's self-awareness of shim's position in the Higher Self. This, again, is individual. When the Final reaches Awakened, the top level of 3rd density existence, the Dominant incarnations are no longer overseeing and always defer to the Awakened Final. Remember, ALL these incarnations are you. When the Final Incarnation is Awakened, it's only the BEGINNING of the end of one phase of progression and the start of the new/next phase. Awakened Final Incarnation & Self-Doubts I am regularly asked by Matrix 5 readers if ‘they are’ a Final Incarnation or Awakened. These are people who are not ready for the M5 materials because if you have to ask, the answer is 'no'. These people are looking for external confirmations for something that can ONLY be given by your own Higher Self. I cannot tell you exactly where you are, BUT I can deduce where you are NOT by the questions asked of me. The opposite side of this coin is the few people who outright declare themselves to be an Awakened Final Incarnation. This one is very easy for me to reveal as there are certain questions ONLY an Awakened Final Incarnation can answer and these involve their own Higher Self. It also serves no purpose for an Awakened Higher Self to declare shimself JUST MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. 63"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"for the declaration. Almost every Awakened Higher Self today will spend most of shim's time observing and gathering last experiences. The reason why I declared myself was because of the Matrix 5 project which is unprecedented in 3rd density Earther history, either pre or post Atlantis, and this is due to EndGame and the need to provide escape hatches to Earther Higher Selves. I have discussed these issues in previous messages. ONLY those Awakened Final Incarnations who have a specific purpose for declaring themselves will ever do so. If they have no reason to call the spotlight on themselves, they remain silent observers gathering information for their Higher Self. This gets back to an earlier message of mine - Do NOT play ‘wanna be’ and be happy with where YOU are in your progression. You are all your incarnations and somewhere in time is YOUR Final Incarnation. All the knowledge I've shared in the M5 materials will also be yours when it is your time. Be at peace with yourself and your own progression and Path. Incamational Missions and The Higher Self Each incarnation has mission(s) to perform. In the low through mid levels, the mission centers on experiencing the physical through the chosen body. Especially in low level incarnations, the spirit is there for the ride and the body rules. The experiences are wrapped around sex (doing or preaching against) and sustenance (work, religion, family). When one reaches the Advanced levels, the spirit exerts more and more control over the physical. This is when more specific, spirit oriented missions occur. The departure from convention indicates spirit over body. An example is breaking from the organized religions that the majority follow in your area and striking out on one's own, usually to New Age and other non-standard religions for the area you live in. For North Americans, it’s wicca, buddhism, new age, etc. For Asians it can be new age, Christian, falun gong, etc. These religions make the conformists uneasy. The uneasiness is from the body's DNA commands to obey/conform to the Game. This religious breaking stuff is an event for low Advanced thru mid-Advanced levels. Sexual orientation issues are another break-out for the spiritually Advancing. Review the segments on bisexuality and 'coming out'. Doing what YOU want over the desires of family members is the spirit striving for individuality and new experiences. There will be Higher Self missions that the incarnation must and will accomplish. The Higher Self will prevent any outside interference in this, such as pre-mature death. The Higher Self will see that you have the physical necessities for completing these missions. You cannot die before they are completed. Remember that your Higher Self chose the time/manner of death before the incarnation began. As an example, I'll use myself. I had been born in a family whose grandparents all came from Poland and was brought up catholic. In my high school days, I began questioning the religion and started my search. My family had a cow over my inquiries and, at the time, they were JUST inquiries. I had various experiences on this track of my incarnation that brought me to where I am now. My Higher Self gave me the energy pulses I needed when I needed MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. 64"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"them to insure that I followed MY mission to Awakening. These pulses of Higher Self energy overrode DNA commands that attempted to suppress the spirit. Another example: I was in the Air Force and had shift work. Hated it. I remember saying that I wanted a Monday - Friday, weekends/holidays off job. I got that after college. Not only that, but I got a job that allowed me the freedom to work on my main incarnational mission, the Matrix 5 information. I have no doubt I have that job BECAUSE of the need for Matrix 5 to be written. Matrix 5 was destined to come out. I remember Monroe trying to get his final book in print. He told my group that he was rejected by publisher after publisher because \"the public wouldn't be able to handle the material\". This is why he said he watered down the material to the weaker version it became, much to many people's disappointment. He sacrificed content for distribution. On one hand, much very important information he wrote will never come out, but it wasn’t meant for him to release it. He didn't fail his mission. What he did was invaluable to those ready for it. Incompletion would not be the case with Matrix 5 which takes people beyond Monroe's valuable materials. Enter Val and his publishing house which is probably the only one who would publish my materials as is. The hell with what the public can accept. Matrix 5 is not written for, nor does it pander to, conformity and the public, as all readers of M5 know. Due to his and our Higher Selves collaborating on this project, Matrix 5 has a worldwide readership. Matrix 5 also needed to come out at this time when computers, instant communications and EndGame are all operating. If M5 came out 300 years ago, how many people would have read it or even knew it existed? This is a major mission event and one that was destined, by Higher Self collaboration, to be a reality. Incarnational missions are of all varieties, some major and some minor, but they are all set experiences your Higher Self requires. Again individuality of path is to be remembered. You must look within to YOUR Higher Self to see what YOUR path experiences are. Look back on your life arid examine decisions/events. Which just seemed to fall into place in front of you? Which ones changed your life/outlook? Discover them and you'll discover the handiwork of YOUR Higher Self. Higher Self Choices - Earth and Non-Earth Incarnations Higher Selves who choose to accept the Earth Game challenge have a much more complicated incarnational path than those who choose not to go the Earth human route. The Earth Game is one with memory blocked and with many hundreds of incarnations going on simultaneously in many different bodies, time periods, etc. Higher Selves who do not want Earth Game experience, but do want 3rd density experience can choose, incarnations one at a time, sequentially in NON-Earth physicals. For example: Andromedan incarnations. When the Andromedan body has served its purpose and dies, and the Higher Self chooses to continue that experience, shim is born into a new Andromedan body with memory intact. It's like changing clothing. While this is valid 3rd density experience, you should be able to see how slowly the Higher Selves, who choose only this path, evolve. These incarnations are 'safe' but will eventually get them to higher levels.

All Rights Reserved. 65"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Earth Game incarnations make for far more rapid development, as Robert Monroe said. When the Higher Self chooses the Earth path, the spirit has HUGE amounts of obstacles to overcome to rediscover shimself. That they DO make it to Final Incarnations shows it is possible for ALL who choose the Earth path to succeed. Nevertheless, many Higher Selves will decline this opportunity to play it safe. This is OK. No judgment here. Each is free to choose their own path. If you have an incarnation in the sequential, alien incarnations, you can choose to go to the Earth rapid advancement path at any time. Once this choice is made, that Higher Self must complete it - no backing out. They realize this before accepting the challenge. The amount of emotions and sensory experiences in the Earth path are unparalleled and therefore attractive to the more daring Higher Selves. Our concern here on the Earth path is not what others are doing in other alien incarnational paths, but to discover who we really are and connect to our Higher Self which is the repository of ALL our incarnational experiences. Once this is done, then you will know the direction YOUR Higher Self, the REAL YOU, will be going. This is why looking inward is far more valuable than outward. A Different Facet: Alien Higher Selves I've given some information on non-Earther Higher Selves and some of their purposes in The Game. As we draw near to the climax of Earther 3rd density existence, it will be the conclusion for those Higher Selves on the Earther incarnational path. Those who accepted this path will be graduating to other areas of development/experiences. What about those who did not choose the Earther human path? What will happen to them? Those who chose the infinitely slower, non-Earther path must still continue in their agonizingly slow (from an Earther Higher Self perspective) path of advancement. They will still desire to play The Game even though the Earther human Game pieces are no longer in play. Earth will revert to a pristine state and will no longer be accessible by these aliens as Earth will be out of phase to them. The Higher Selves who are reptilian, Sirian, Pleiadian, Vegan, Tau Ceti, etc will slowly progress until they, too, have reached the spiritual level to no longer desire to play the 3rd density Game. Alien groups are at various stages of Advancement with some groups far more Advanced than others. They will realize that there are NO losers among the Higher Selves who were involved in The Game. You should be able to see from Earther power struggles (many are aliens in disguise) and from bits of information on alien interactions that, even though these beings have been around for WAY longer than Earthers, Earthers have spiritually progressed in lightspeed next to the snail's pace of aliens. Remember, this is their choice - Law of Allowance. So, the Orion queen and Sirian king will eventually progress onward, but how many millions more years? It doesn't matter to Earther Higher Selves who will be busy elsewhere. Alien planets/races tend to progress as a unit. Earther Higher Selves progress as individuals, a Major Key in understanding The Game's structure. If you went to an alien planet, say Ummo, Iarga or Erra, you would find that almost everything is similar and everyone is about at the same level.

The bleed-over of conformity, that we hear so much on Earth, is ALIEN in origin and brought here by those aliens who were and still are in residence and control. The alien Higher Selves will continue with their sequential incarnations, and that's fine because that's the way they want it to be. By the time the reptilians have reached the point where an Earther Awakened Final Incarnation is, you have no idea what marvels you will be experiencing. I'm not giving this information to ‘start a stream’ on alien Higher Selves. This is given to you to help you understand your path vs. their paths AND to give you more to consider and ponder about. Develop YOUR Higher Selfs experiences/abilities and leave the aliens to their own devices. Group vs Individual Progression (Special Gold Edition Segment) In Stargate SG-i, season 2 - episode The Fifth Race - the aliens, that the series, refers to as the Asgaard (really Greys), tell ultra Mid level Col. O'Neill that Earthers are not an advanced race and they can't associate with Earthers until they progress further as a people. This is the sequential path idea, one that their incarnations cling to - Advancement as a race or planet. Since the sequentials do progress as a planet, they feel that everyone must as well, hence the false air of superiority which is technologically, not spiritually based. Earther simultaneous incarnations never progress as a group or planet. The whole basis of simultaneous incarnations is individuality, both in path and progression. This concept of true individuality, the basis of higher densities, must be discovered and embraced by the sequential incarnates at some stage of their progression. Once this is desired by that Higher Selfs incarnation, shim will begin the Advanced stages of the sequential path. The constant theme in many science fiction shows/movies is that Earth is ‘not worthy of hobnobbing with the aliens’. This is something that the sequentials hope will delay the true Advancement of Earther Higher Selves. This is another dead end in the Game, like ‘karma’. Monroe said that ‘karma’ exists ONLY if you believe it. Know that your individuality is really unique. This is one reason why breaking experiential loops is SO important. When you break these on your own and the ultimate decision/action to break them IS yours alone, you prove your individuality to yourself with \"I did it\". You may get assistance from others, but if you didn't use your own efforts, you could not succeed. When you watch the aliens prance around (on film, tv or on Earth) and look at Earthers as food or as beneath them just remember (referring to the Matrix 5 materials) who you really are and who they really are. Remember too that it is they who are poking their noses/snouts in our affairs and planet and not the other way around. Another Variation of Higher Selves In the Matrix 5 materials, I've written quite a bit about simultaneous and sequential incarnating Higher Selves. Now it's time for me to give you some information about another group of Higher Selves - those choosing NOT to play the Game. I've only heard of one other person even mentioning this group and that was Robert Monroe, although he never spoke more about this than the event that took place. I think it's in his second volume, Far Journeys, that he encounters one of these beings.

All Rights Reserved. exploring when he meets this luminescent form who demands worship. This briefly caught Bob by surprise. Read the book for all the details. This meeting involved a Higher Self that has chosen not to play the Game. Remember, one's Higher Self is independent and decides what shim would like to do or not. There are benefits and liabilities from decisions on those higher levels just as they are on this 3rd density level. This example also shows the polarity of a being on a higher density. From what is written, B06 seems to have run into a Dark polarity Higher Self. Dark polarities are self-centered and have power trips along those lines. When you have advanced enough, especially after your Final Incarnation and the re- melding of all your incarnations back into your Higher Self, there are some things you cannot get away with in the higher densities. One of them is deception. Your emotions are clearly visible to all. Joy, sadness, anger, etc are all visible through the colors they tint your aura with. The luminescence is part of the Higher Selfs energy and power. When Bob didn't give that Higher Self the subservience/worship that shim demanded, the being reacted badly, but did not attempt to damage Bob. If one was to astral travel to this density, one appears very small next to the residents of this level. This is what I discovered when I found myself on one of these much higher densities, although I didn't run into a Darkside Higher Self, but another type of being (don't ask). Higher Selves who choose to enter the Game, either as simultaneous OR sequential incarnates, are far in Advance of those who choose not to. Yes, simultaneous incarnates are the most Advanced, but sequentials are more Advanced than non-Game players. Non- Gamers know this. This is why the being didn't dare attempt anything threatening beyond intimidation with Bob. That being knew that Bob's Higher Self was watching. Connect the dots here and you'll see what I mean. The densities higher than 3rd contain such a massive variety of beings and energies that you can be amazed by them. Of course your Higher Self already has far greater knowledge about them than you do consciously (part of the Game, again). The wonders of creation are waiting for you once you graduate/conclude from your participation in the Game. How fantastic they are, too. Forced Conformity Forced conformity, especially in vogue in the United States, has its origins NOT in the realms of tolerance but rather in the dark halls of alien systems (sequential incarnations). I've discussed a bit about how alien systems seem SO boring to an Earther since everyone is pretty much the same, dresses similar, acts similar and progresses as a planetary unit. Conformity shuts down individuality and individual expression, something that Earther Higher Selves love to experience. Earth incarnations are intended to be WIDELY different and thus assist the Earther Higher Self incarnates in experiences that are vastly different. A European warrior, an African tribal woman, a Native American shaman, a Western businessman and a Chinese farmer, to name only a few examples. Although aliens created the different races on Earth, they, unknowingly, set the stage for the mosaic of experiences that would become ‘The Game’ on Earth 3rd density.

When an Earther-experience Higher Self wanted to taste how it was to be a real female, shim could incarnate as a woman in Rome or in ancient Egypt or in Atlantis or in isoo's Japan, for examples. To be a real male, shim could incarnate anywhere except in Western countries of the late 20th century to today. Each of the different races offered unique experiences and each area of the globe allowed totally new varieties. There was no global conformity. Now, you have the Americans trying to make the world conform to their beliefs and lifestyles. Major religions are attempting to create a planetary belief system with the prime clash as between Christian and muslim for dominance. The lists of 'you can't say' and 'you can't do' in the West (especially the US) are strong arm attempts to homogenize the population and do away with all significant differences. This started with ‘female status’ (what else is new). This points the finger at the reptilians who are very rigid in their conformity and are female dominated. Now, the idiots on this planet, especially low level, mid level and minions who LOVE to conform have become the prime enforcers of this shame, which is why you don't have too many Final Incarnations in this time period. The atmosphere is horrible. The ones who resist conforming come from both the various Advanced levels AND from the polarities. The FALSE resisters are those who complain, not because there is conformity but because they don’t conform to their own rigid standards. These are both the right wing, fascist types AND the left wing, ultra­ liberals. For example, Michael Moore in his 'Stupid White Men' book is very correct on his taking on Darksider Bush & his corporate henchmen, BUT then he starts bashing the white races for being white with all the variations that go with that experience. This is how ultra-liberals act. The fascists will correctly complain about forcing situations of tolerance (can't be forced, must be learned) but will try to force their bogus Christian religion and hate on everyone. These are just two areas where alien/polaric manipulation is active, with the root desire to fuck up simultaneous incarnational experiences. One thing about this is that it's TOO late. We are at the end of that cycle and these are manipulations of those in panic. You always have to go deeper than the surface to find out what happening on Earth these days. On the surface, it can seem fine that ‘both genders are totally equal’ and ‘should be able to do anything the other gender does’. This was not true throughout history when there were major differences in the genders thus making the experiences vastly different. Higher Selves in these past incarnations were able to learn FAR more from this than the pseudo equality of today. It was in the Middle Ages, the fucked up 'chivalry' of the royals (alien controlled) and the desire of non-royals to imitate them that slowly began the fall into the chaos of today by placing females on a pedestal that they should never have been put upon. Then, in the 19th century when the alien DNA commands kicked in ... well, this has been discussed already. This comparison can extend to everything else being forced on people today. It is a serious attempt to homogenize Earthers because the Orion Empire is returning and intends to make Earth an open member of the Empire, which has homogenous, conforming populations. Forced conformity is not something 'good'. It is anything but. Observe and always look deeper. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 69"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Intolerance, Conformity and Farther Incarnations One of the hallmarks of difference in Earther simultaneous incarnations, as opposed to alien sequential incarnations, is the great variety of types of people on the planet. As I've written in earlier segments, alien worlds are homogenous in look and culture, with no more than slight differences. Take the planet Acart for example. They dress the. same, have the same living styles and, from what I've read, would be terribly boring for me other than a brief visit. These people are progressing as a planet, as do all sequential incarnates. That means slowly and, from a simultaneous point of view, tediously. Here on Earth, due to the simultaneous incarnating Higher Selves AND the various alien cultures that have tampered with Earther genetics, we have a huge variety of cultures and racial variations. The real bonus here is that, as a simultaneous incarnating being, you can experience true variety without leaving the planet. This assists the incarnating spirit to progress and develop tolerance for being different. Intolerance comes from body ID viewpoint. When the spirit has not matured enough, the body holds control. Tolerance of differences is seen all over the different higher densities, even with polarities. Superficial 3rd density issues like body races, types, etc are just non­ issues among the spiritually Advanced. If anything, being different makes one more interesting to the spiritually Advanced because difference equals change potential The spiritually Advanced thrive on changes and difference. Conformity equals stagnation. Stagnation is what the Game would like to occur, yet change exists despite the Game because change overrides the Game. Since the Game cannot stop change, it has made ‘allowances’ for it. Conformity is the drive for the Orion Empire and their Dark AND Light allies. Such concepts as 'be like us', 'obey or go to eternal suffering' or the ever-popular use of guilt to stifle independence are all attempts to halt change and progression. Everyone progresses at their own pace and according to their Higher Selfs plan. We have incarnates, at this time, who are everything from 'first' incarnation to Final Incarnation, hence a HUGE variety of attitudes, outlooks, etc. This is why I say that my materials are my observations and experiences and should be regarded as such and not 'thou must' rules that polarities want you to obey. I have also said several times that if you don't like what you read, forget it. I am nobody's ‘leader’. Leaders require followers, which is why I use the pseudonym, 'The Author'. I don't want followers or people who require that I make their decisions for them or camping out on my front porch. You have to be your own leader. If anything I've written helps you decide what you want to do, good. If you aren't interested, good. Meanwhile, my adventures continue and experiences build. Today, America has become very unbalanced at the direction of the Game. Anyone who appears \"different\" is suspected of being a 'terrorist'. This, of course, is not true and the American people are being played for fools. The Americans will continue to give away their power, as per the Game's requirements and Dark polarity demands for a fascist police state with all the accompanying problems. Police states demand conformity. Remember that when you or your neighbors dance to the next pied piper tune out of Washington. Germany went down a similar path in the 30's.

When you are in Very Advanced stages, you can easily see this manipulation and you don't want to be surrounded by people who thrive on these lower levels of progression since you have moved beyond that particular stage of experience. Appreciating people who are different than you or your background indicates a facet of spiritual maturity. I love talking to people different than me and hearing about their cultures, etc. It's like going to a different planet when you immerse yourself in another culture. When you do this, even if it's just for a short time, you widen your appreciation of what's different. This is something your Higher Self wants to experience via shim's incarnations. Multiple Personalities - A New Perspective As I wrote in earlier material, Earth incarnations, for those with Higher Selves, are simultaneous, not sequential, since ALL incarnations occur at the same time. If the physical brain is damaged in a certain way either in birth or through trauma, the body can be damaged and other incarnations can bleed through into the physical of the damaged incarnation. The only incarnation able and intended to handle input from other incarnations (your Dominants) is your Final Incarnation. When the damaged incarnation switches to another 'personality', the incarnation's energy stream from the person's Higher Self allows unprocessed/uncontrolled free-flowing input from incarnations close in frequency (time line) to manifest their energy through the damaged incarnation's body. This could not happen if Earther incarnations were sequential since then there'd be only one energy stream from the Higher Self. The physical body is also very electric. Short circuits to certain areas of the brain can effect the energy stream from the Higher Self as the energy stream is filtered through the physical body. Multiple personalities is NOT a normal situation by any means, yet it is also not the dreaded situation most people cringe from. This would be considered an experiential choice by the individual Higher Self. Why? Who can say why a Higher Self would chose this situation except that person's Higher Self. More could be accessed in the Library on Monroe level 27, for those interested in this topic. The multiple personality syndrome is more serious to incarnations with less experience/maturity. Those of low through mid-range incarnational levels really can become quite unbalanced by this disorder and require hospitalization. Remember, society and the Empire will do almost anything to keep you from realizing who you REALLY are. If people understood multiple personalities from this perspective AND people were taught who they are without the religious/'scientific' bullshit, we wouldn't have all the problems we have today on Earth. Some of you will find this information helpful in verifying simultaneous incarnations as well as assistingyou in understanding more about this type of experience.

When Earth's Vibrations Get Too Heavy I was talking with Val on the phone tonight and mentioned the very heavy, negative vibrations being generated on Earth today - victimhood, oppressive religions, female gender false-superiority, drug abuse (prescription/hard street stuff), you can't say/do anything that does not appeal to all, and so on...you get the drift. The more Advanced you are, the more sensitive you are to vibrations and these depressing ones do weigh heavy around you. We are surrounded by them at work, on tv, in print/film, etc. Fear is THE word of the current time period. When these become wearying to you, I advise you to do something that you enjoy doing. After I got off the phone with Val, I put on the up musical, Music Man, on the dvd. Great, fun film. Do what is positive-generating to you (fuck everyone else - there are times when it should be JUST you). Ben & Jerry's? Light reading material? A fun dvd or vhs film? A hike in the mountains? A walk along the shore? Get a massage? WHATEVER it takes to break you away from the madness being generated (on purpose) in these Final Years EXCEPT escapist routes - drugs/alcohol/denials and similar. We all need to do different things for variety in our lives. To be absorbed totally in one topic for months & months doesn't give you the breaks you need to process what you've learned and to enjoy your incarnation. The higher densities are NOT full of dour beings who never laugh but rather many beings who fully enjoy their existences. The HEAVY vibrations surrounding us now (both people and electronic generated) are part of Dark's plan. It takes a strong and Advanced incarnation NOT to get caught up in it. Just remember to take relaxing time, pleasure time for yourself It will make coping with the current situation easier on you. Observations: Matters of Balance I've heard comments about how a couple of people ONLY want to hear of matters spiritual. Spiritual matters are the Light side of polarity. Matters dealing with the Game are Dark side of polarity. You are unbalanced if you ONLY want to hear about spiritual matters while incarnated on Earth OR you ONLY want to hear about physical matters. Balance is the blending of both to serve your Higher Self Yin-Yang balance is jumping from one to the other, example: noticing the Event, but failing to make appropriate spiritual connections (such as 'it was their time', if their Higher Self allowed it to happen, it was for the experience for BOTH dead and survivors, etc) makes you part of the Game (such as 'we have to get them/revenge', fear controlled, glue to eveiy word the TV says even if it keeps repeating, etc). What you're getting here is the Balance that comes to Awakened Final incarnations. You are not all ready for that, and that's ok. Proceed at your pace, BUT don't try and lecture me to 'only give spiritual information'. You probably want one of the Light sider sites where you can coo and bless each other. If you only want what's going on in the Event at the moment, you want CNN or just about any other TV channel on now. If you want a Balanced approach, you're in the right place. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 72"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Observation: Faux 'Balance' Today it seems to be popular among many Lightsiders to claim they are actually in Balance. As I've stated in Matrix 5, Balance has specific qualities to it (check previous materials for more on this subject). True Balance cannot be achieved by any 3rd density incarnation that is not an Awakened Final. While it is possible to achieve a yin-yang style balance in Very Advanced incarnations, one needs much specific information (path-specific info from that Higher Self, a select series of experiences, etc) before true Balance is able to be attained. Just as there are wanna-be Final incarnations, there are wanna-be Balance individuals/groups. These people are actually Lightsiders. They seek to clash with the Game and change all (or most) of the rules. While scanning some of their declarations, these Lightsiders, in the false claim of Balance, are seeking to rally the troops to do battle to make the Game in their image. The Darkside LOVES this kind of talk, as misguided incarnations, searching for a higher way for their path, read a litany of Balance-appearing catch words and phrases then are mislead into believing this is ‘the Balance way’. This is an incarnational experience for them. Those people who use this faux (false/fake) balance are usually otherwise nice, mid-level Advanced incarnates who don't want to face their true level and seek to lead and have others follow. These are some of the wanna-be's. They are not able to grasp that Balance does iwt call for followers, ONLY Light and Dark polarities do so! While they consciously know that and say they don't want followers to their plans, nevertheless, followers flock to them and they all discuss their plans under the faux balance leader. True Balance never does 'war plans' to change the Game. Balance understands the Game and the purposes of it. Much of that has been discussed in the Matrix 5 materials. Balance OBSERVES the Game and points out interesting facets of it. but does not call for actions against it. The Darksiders are thrilled that this faux balance arm of the Lightsiders is active now. It feeds their side because the call for action will result in an equal but opposite reaction from the Darkside. Faux balance people cannot abide just observing because they are genuine Lightsiders who constantly seek to defeat the Dark, one of the main tenants of the Game. Very Advanced levels, for the most part, have put away much of the ‘defeat the Dark’ mentality. These incarnations are close to becoming their Final Incarnation which exists elsewhere in time. Another thread I've discovered with the faux balance people is that there are alien groups behind their philosophies. That in itself is a red flag to people who have read the Matrix 5 materials, especially dealing with simultaneous and sequential incarnations. Since there are aliens encouraging this faux balance, well, you connect the dots! Something to remember is that you should follow whatever you feel you must. If you want the experiences connected with fighting the other polarity then go for it. It's your path and your experiences. It's OK. I would advise these people to see themselves as they are and not what they are not. This, of course, may not be possible for someone at that level, but will definitely occur in more Advanced incarnations for that Higher Self. It’s ALL about experiences. EVERYONE will be able to see it for what it is by the time they reach their own Awakened Final Incarnation.

The Third Density Game Observations: Information on some Basic Rules of The Game I have told you about simultaneous and sequential incarnations and some of the implications of each. However, for those Higher Selves involved in the Game, there is one constant: all pre-3rd density memories are kept from the incarnations until the 3rd density path is complete. This is why even though the sequential incarnations retain their past, 3rd density incarnational life memories, they have to build from a clean slate with a first incarnation. With each following incarnation, more information is added. The simultaneous incarnations also start 3rd density with a clean memory slate in order to participate in the Game. But this group is adding to the Higher Selfs memories from all incarnations at once, scattered throughout Earther 3rd density time periods. In both cases, NO pre-Game memories are lost, just hidden. What can work against spiritual advancement is the desire for physical immortality, a passion for the Orion Empire. BUT, when you look at reptilian royals, who are fanatics about cloning and life extensions, they don't advance spiritually. The Orion Empire reptilians are pretty stagnant spiritually, however this does serve a purpose in the Game. It is not for me to say more on their path, as our concern is our simultaneous path. Just know it all works out in the end. Another negative on the sequential path, from a simultaneous point of view, is that they tend to choose reincarnation in the same star group, .i.e., Pleiadian, Tau Ceti, etc. They don’t have the vast variety of Earther incarnations that simultaneous incarnates here jump around in. This severely cuts down on experiences. There are also far less gender-jumping incarnations among them. They can get comfortable in either male or female bodies and rarely hop into the other. This is one of the reasons why, for example, the Errans of Taygeta (Pleiadian) are homophobic. Needless to say, those Higher Selves who don't choose simultaneous paths are definitely much less adventurous. The Game is far more complex and there are certain segments of it you must discover on your own at some point in your progression. That the simultaneous incarnates are developing so rapidly toward spiraling out (thus winning) the Game and leaving the sequentials to slowly progress on their own is significant. When the Earther experience is completed, ALL Earther Higher Selves will have proceeded to new levels while the sequentials continue along on their path MINUS the Earther faction. That should give you something to think about! 74"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. The Game & Participation In It While I have said, over and over, that you cannot defeat The Game, nevertheless, at varying points in your individual progression, YOUR Higher Self will want the experience of attempting to confront The Game so that you learn. You can have revolutionary experiences such as being a German anti-Roman fighter, a Chinese Cultural Revolutionary, a Southern rebel fighter or a Zulu warrior attempting to hold The Game back from South Africa. All of these and countless others can and are experienced by Higher Self incarnations as part of The Game FOR THE EXPERIENCES. The Higher Self knows all about The Game and its rules even if the incarnation does not even know The Game exists. These experiences are right for YOU. When you get to Very Advanced incarnations, you are not likely to engage in physical rebellions/controls, but do get involved in mental observations based on Other Life Incarnations you've had. By the time you reach Awakened Final Incarnation, you understand the value in actions as well as the position of Observer and the purpose of The Game. You realize that, experiences aside, your goal is not to defeat The Game but rather to graduate (escape) from it, to learn the Laws of the Universe and incorporate these Laws into your life. You allow The Game to proceed because it must, although your part in sustaining it is ending. Once you realize that, you can depart The Game and you no longer want to participate in it, you are headed for the escape hatch and your next level beyond 3rd/4th densities. The problem with those incarnations dealing with Matrix 5 materials (when they are not yet ready), written from the perspective and position of a Final Incarnation, is that they can degrade THEIR experiences and positions into 'wanna be' Finals. They do themselves a dis­ service by attempting to deny where they are and the experiences they need. Yes, reading M5 will give you vastly new important information and, yes, you MAY alter your decisions based on it, but you should not force yourself to be something you are not yet. You may be, in 3 months or 3 years, or not at all in your current incarnation. If you want to run to China, like that group of Australians, and protest with the Falun Gong group in Beijing (and get arrested), then do it. It is your experience. Just because I would or wouldn’t do something does not mean that you should do what I do. Don't be a FOLLOWER. Adapt what you agree with to fit YOUR path. Don't worry about the rest. Trust in YOUR Higher Self to guide you to what you need to learn, to know and to experience. Today's times are THE most difficult since Atlantis, for various reasons. The variety of experiences is unmatched on Earth. These times are Endgame. Participate where you feel you must. Leave participation in something when it is time for you to move on. DON'T fear others' opinions of you. DON'T come under others' control unless you want that experience. The more Advanced you are, the more you resist others’ opinions and controls when they seek to drag you back into The Game. You must learn to be your own leader with NO 'followers'. As long as you encourage 'followers', you encourage people to give their power to you. Yes, this is another experience but one you will shed by your own Final Incarnation. This is not the same as dealing with others on a similar path as yours moving in the same direction. In that case, you walk with others and share, but not follow. As with all M5 materials, this message gives you something to think about and, I hope, assist you in making your decisions. You can get all kinds of advice, but the DECISION must be your own. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 75"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Observations: Light Feeding Dark I just read this article written by a Light-sider. The title is ’How To Think Like A Terrorist To Survive Terrorist Times'. Near the end, she. has a brief paragraph entitled 'Holding The Spiritual Candle Of Light Despite The Present Darkness': \"I firmly believe that each one of us as individuals can help prevent terrorism by our prayers, energy of love and light sent throughout the world. By becoming aware.\" She probably meant to say 'throughout the world by becoming aware.' Now, becoming 'aware' is one thing. It's something else to challenge the Dark polarity by attacking it with 'love & light', the Light-siders boundless belief of ‘superiority’. THE DARK POLARITY WANTS TO BE SHOWERED WITH 'LOVE & LIGHT’ BECAUSE THIS ENCOURAGES THEM TO DO EVEN DARKER DEEDS. I've said it in M5 that if 'love & light' is so effective in war times, why do they bother with armies? Just haul out the Light-siders who can chant, coo and spray the Dark-siders with their version of 'love'. Wouldn't this have worked in WWII? Yeah, right. In the physical, the Dark-siders would have had fits of laughter and mowed them down. Remember when, in the 50's movie War of the Worlds when the Light-sider priest believed he could defeat the aliens by waving his bible and sending thoughts of 'love & light'? How did the aliens reciprocate? They fried his ass. THAT’S what you'll get by trying to confront Dark in that manner. This 'love & light' shit actually feeds the Dark-siders, which should make people wonder what Dark-siders (passing as Light-siders) are pushing the Light-sider fools to believe this crap. I remember one reptilian Dark-sider who said he challenges anyone to surround themselves with 'love & light' and see if he can't harm them. However, it is in the interest of the Dark polarity to keep up this sham stance and, thereby, use the Light-siders to feed the Dark. These people may as well do what the Serb civilians did during that war a few years back. Put a paper bulls-eye on their shirts to make it easier for the Dark-siders to hit them (yes, the US Dark-siders at that time). The Law of Allowance says that Light-siders must be free to_ _ be what then are, j ust as a re Dark-siders. This is~part of the Game. Light-siders do not follow this law and neither do Dark-siders. This is a law with Balance at its root and Balance is what BOTH polarities dislike. The Christian bible says their god will spew out those of Balance. Well, we know about that jackass alien. So, do consider these matters when deciding what YOU want to do. There is no right or wrong, just different experience, BUT the best choices are made with greater information, so you are less likely to be suckered in. As with everything else, by the time you reach VERY Advanced stages, things will be made clearer to you.

This is not going to be a long message to you all but this is an important one to those ready to grasp it. In previous Matrix 5 messages, I told you that ALL Earther Higher Self incarnations, on the Simultaneous Path, are occurring at the SAME time in all time periods that each Higher Self wants to gain experiences from. Hence, your Atlantean, Egyptian, Greek, Chinese, African, etc incarnations are NOW in the different phases of the Game that we call 'time'. Knowing this, can you change the future in 3rd density Earth's segments of the Game? NO! This is why I keep telling you that the Game cannot be changed on a global scale. ONLY your participation and Advancement (or not) can be changed. The Lightsider fantasy I see over and over about changing the rules and scenes of the Game are completely delusion. Again, these people are worried about the external rather than the internal. They don't yet grasp the importance of internal development regardless of what the external scenery is. The experiences you gain through ALL your simultaneous incarnations is what matters, not the settings that the Game has arranged. As long as your primary concern is the external (the Game), your progress is slower. Once you realize what I've been saying (or at least much of it) in Matrix 5 AND put it into practice to suit your Path, you progress in a hyper fast mode. Can you change the Game's rules/settings - again no. Can you change HOW you play/participate IN the Game - YES! The Game continues until ALL, both sequential AND simultaneous incarnations, have completed THEIR parts of the Game. Earther Higher Self simultaneous incarnates are on the FAST track. We complete the Game FAR, FAR sooner than the sequentials. We have things to do and places to go beyond 3rd density, as I've said before. It is WHEN you realize that YOU are YOUR central figure and can detach yourself from the Game (as much as is practical) via your Final Incarnation, that you really begin to spiral out of the Game, BUT the Game WILL go on. Once you have all the experiences YOU need, the rest does not matter. The Final Incarnation can gain the lion's share of experiences and is where you tie together all experiences that your other incarnations are living. All the bullshit of 'saving' others is just a distraction from you discovering who you are, and also a violation of the Law of Allowance. Imposing your will on another (even if you are correct in your position) is Dark side, but I've talked about this before. If you still want to participate in breeding, religion, polarity sides, etc, then DO so. It's your Higher Selfs individual path and where that incarnation is at this time period. You don't belong reading Matrix 5 materials. You will only upset your physical, which still controls you, AND I will keep releasing materials that cause the physical and immature spirits consternation. After all, if despite the caveats I have place in Matrix 5, you STILL insist on reading materials you are not ready to comprehend, you deserve what YOU stirred up. I MAY have more to say on this topic, but, for now, consider what I've told you here. It's awesome!

Observations: On Feelings of Resentment and The Game Once learning about the Game, low to mid-level Advanced WILL resent the Game because they can't understand the mechanics of it. The Law of Allowance says you allow them to proceed at their pace and where they are. 'Saving' others is a low to mid-level Advanced thing and not of the Very Advanced. The resentment of incarnational levels is ALWAYS of lower to advanced. You most certainly CAN resent their constant interfering in your stuff, however. This is a vast difference from \"resenting where they are\". The Game and The Players As I wrote in 'Changing the Future', the Game’s functions are set and only you can free yourself from the Game, thereby winning. Just as when you play a board game, there are rules and certain things that must/will occur during the play of the game. The same goes for the 3rd density Game. The two player groups are the simultaneous and the sequential Higher Selves. These groups are further subdivided within themselves. With the simultaneously incarnating (fast track) Higher Selves, each individual Higher Self operates as an individual unit with experiences, events and time periods chosen by each Higher Self to operate within the Games parameters. Within the sequential Higher Selves, they operate as a group and rarely, if ever, change into another group. Hence, you have the reptilian faction, the Sirian faction, the Andromedan faction and so on. In almost all cases, they proceed/Advance as a planet or group. This is VERY slow because each waits for the others to progress at a planetary rate. Earther Higher Selves progress independently at their own speed. Not proceeding as a group is daunting to the sequentials as well as not retaining conscious memory of shim's other 3rd density lives. The one time that a Higher Self can 'change sides' is if that Higher Self decides to enter the Earther Higher Self path with all the benefits and the liabilities associated with that path. This type of switching sides IS allowed in the Game. It does not occur very often. Due to the very nature of simultaneous incarnations, it is obvious that a simultaneous can never regress to a sequential path. That the sequential group stays within a certain race and progresses as a planet, at the minimum, shows much (to simultaneous incarnates) about their limitations. Yes, they have all incarnation memories, but their experiences are limited to that race and racial development. The one element that all sequentials have in common is FEAR. In this case, the fear is being born into each incarnation without memories of other incarnations. It is a courageous Higher Self that takes the simultaneous path, as Robert Monroe said. Simultaneous incarnates choose all the different races on Earth and can experience segments of the various alien cultures vicariously through the races that the alien cultures engineered here on Earth after the Orion Empire did their genetic 'thing' to Ancient Earthers. This is ALL part of the Game. Simultaneous incarnations include black African groups, Asian varieties, various European cultures and so on. Each different Earth culture was formed by copying alien races who tampered with Earther humans eons ago. This is an enormous advantage over the ‘single race’/’evolve as a planet’ path that the sequential incarnates Advance in. 78"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Much of the Game's strategies involve working against the simultaneous incarnates. The sequentials use all manner of blocks/obstacles to keep this group from winning at the Game. However the Game IS geared for the simultaneous TO WIN by departing from the Game before the sequentials. The main burden for the simultaneous incarnate is to regain your spiritual identity. Huge clues for your spiritual identity are found within the Laws of the Universe. Once you discover YOUR spiritual identity AND live it, you are well on your way to graduating. If you intellectually know it, but choose not to live it, you still have a way to go in your development. The sequential aliens will come in second place, in the Game, but they, too, will eventually graduate and the 3rd density Game will be over. Lots for you to think about here. The Game and The Players - Part II While I've given you more on the Game, from a galactic viewpoint, I now will give you more information on the Game players - the Higher Selves. You may have heard that the reptilians are the oldest race in the galaxy. You have heard that there are many races that are FAR older than Earthers. Earthers are considered as having ‘far to go’ to reach these aliens in most areas (in all areas if you were to believe aliens). Now, get ready for a different perspective. It's sequential vs. simultaneous incarnations in this spotlight. Sequential incarnating Higher Selves have one incarnation at a time, retaining conscious memories of their incarnations at birth. This, as one can see, is a SLOW process of development. Simultaneous incarnations occur in all time periods since the genetic alteration of Ancient Earthers, thus allowing that individual Higher Self to receive tremendous inputs of information, emotions and sensory experiences at the same time. This is the FAST track of development. The caveat here is that the incarnating Higher Self will have NO memory of who shim is when shim begins the Earther path, but will have to find ways to relearn who shim is. So, here you have an ancient history of sequential incarnations slowly gathering information and (mostly) controlled experiences. Due to these sequential incarnations genetic tampering with Ancient Earther humans, a window of opportunity had opened up for those Higher Selves daring enough to risk the challenge that we know as the Earther incarnational path. This rapid advancement has spooked the aliens AND the polarity addicts. Various methods are being used at this time to try and halt or reverse the advancements made. They know what the 2012 period brings and they would like to undo it. When the Earther 3rd density period is over, these successful Higher Selves will move into higher densities to gather vast, NEW experiences. Meanwhile, those who prefer the slower, safer path will continue to their own conclusion much farther down the road. After the Earther graduation, Earth will be off limits to aliens as the Planetary Spirit reaches shim's own full potential. Alien races proceed as a group. Everyone is pretty much at the same level. Earther humans proceed individually, thus you have a wide variety of people at all times in history. Some alien groups would like us to believe that we have to ‘mesh as a whole’ and become as they are. This is interference by the sequential Higher Selves that must be ignored.

That Final and Dominant incarnations are spread over most 'time' periods is part of the protection so that the sequential aliens cannot swoop down and break Game rides. As stated in other materials in Matrix 5, if one of them does try to break Game rules, the individual Higher Self WILL interfere directly to prevent an unwarranted change of shim's Plan. Think of the difference in the two incarnational paths this way - the ULTIMATE role- playing game with a twist. Sequential incarnations are playing a single game (role) at a time. Simultaneous incarnations are playing hundreds and hundreds of games (roles) at the same time. I have had over 1600 incarnations, so my Higher Self is involved in 1600+ DIFFERENT role playing games at one time AND processing all of the experiences learned from them. This means that one Higher Self, who has had sequential incarnations for millions of years, can be experientially surpassed by another Higher Self who has been in Earther incarnations for only thousands of years. The aliens may like to have us think that technology is connected to advancement, but this is not true. It's spiritual development that counts, NOT technology. Hence, we have the Earth 'quarantine' while the alien meddlers still meddle. The Earther experience seems to be concluding around 2012, while the sequential incarnational path will continue until it reaches its own conclusion. This gives you something to think about, a whole NEW perspective on the Game of 3rd density. Observations: Where the idea of \"We Are All The Same\" Comes From Incarnates below Very Advanced in their progression LOVE to say 'we are all the same' and 'you're no better than anyone else'. These catch phrases are used when the person feels insecure with their position in life. While it’s true we are all in a human body, we are definitely anything but 'all the same' spiritually. The 'you're no better than anyone else' is an alien originated trick used to try and make people conform to what the GROUP thinks you should be. This is because on alien worlds everyone IS pretty much the same and the whole planet/race progresses as a unit. This is sequential incarnations. The aliens disguised on this planet do seek to impose their values on Earthers and this is one of them. The prime alien agenda seems to be to keep Higher Self incarnates from recognizing who they are. The Andromedan group uses lofty language on Earthers \"you are Pa'Taal, so high and developed\" then goes on lecturing listeners (through the contactee or the web moderator) on ‘how you should live your life’. If Earthers are who they say we are, it should be the other way around. However this is THEIR scam and agenda. Remember any Higher Self who isn't part of the simultaneous Earther incarnational system is in the other side of the Game trying to keep us from discovering who we really are. I had one guy tell me earlier this year, 'except for everything you know and can do, you're no better than me’. Doesn't that phrase just make you wonder how that brain operates? It IS all about progression, BUT it isn't a race so there’s no need for jealousy as every Higher Self will eventually get to the same level BUT not at the same time.

If the world were populated with ‘only’ Very Advanced and higher spiraling Higher Selves, you wouldn't have the mess we're in, you wouldn’t have the Red Cross begging for blood (and not for what they say it's for) yet turning away any man who has had sex with just one man since 1977, catholic schools banning Harry Potter because he doesn't credit 'god' with anything, Jerry Falwell blaming the attacks on liberals, gays and anyone else who doesn't bow to his 'god', people attacking indians and american muslims for what happened (you don't see them attacking Christians because McVey was a Christian or the Klan is a Christian group) and so on. [Ed.- You also wouldn’t have the situation in the movie Contact where belief in an external ‘god’ was a requirement for participation in novel experience.] We are FAR from being 'all the same' and there are incarnates 'better than others' because they earned it. This is another example of simultaneous incarnations for you. Since everyone’s Final Incarnation, Dominants and Very Advanced are scattered all over the time phases, you DO have everyone different. I'm not including minions and aliens who live among us. They are trying to be spoilers/roadblocks for the Higher Self Earthers. Don't you see how the more difficult they make it for us, the faster we progress and the more we learn? Hang in there. Also, the information I've given you in M5 is unique, and its own Wild Card, but on an individual level, not global or Game shattering. This Wild Card can rapidly advance YOUR outward spiral IF you choose to adapt any of it to fit your Path.

Sequential Influence and The Game Sirius - The Dog Star In reading some works on Sirius, the authors correctly state that the Sphinx has the body of a dog (not a lion, as supposed by some including astrologers). The face of the Sphinx is that of a woman, not a man. The proper interpretation of this is the female (Orion queen) is the 'head' of her Sirian allies (the dog body). Sirius is said to sit at the feet of Orion in the sky. Egyptian god, Horus, is linked with the \"dog star\". These are just a few of the references pairing the canine and the star Sirius. This is due to the wolfish appearance of the brutal Sirian warriors. [Ed.- The Sirians have a love of eating their enemies alive while in battle.] When the Sirians tried to invade the Orion Empire Ages ago, they failed and made a treaty with the Orion Empire for an alliance. The Sirians were very vicious and usually devoured the residents of a conquered planet. After making their treaty with Orion, Sirius was told to refrain from that practice, as slaves and a source of food were required (farm planets). Sirius is still providing front line soldiers for the. Orion Empire. The term 'dog soldiers' comes from the reference to Sirius being the foot troops of Orion. This term is still used today for the lower military. The appearance/behavior of a Sirian being is very similar to the 2 hunters shown in the first season of Farscape on the Sci-Fi channel. As soon as I saw them, I said, \"That's what the Sirians look like.\" In this series, they are called Vocarions and the two in this show have the dogish names of Rorf and Rorg. The Sirian Empire is male dominated. The Orions do not interfere in this. To see a color picture from that Farscape episode, use this address (www.scifi.com/farscape/journeylogs/blood.html) and scroll down to the bottom. The picture on the right is VERY close to what a Sirian looks like. Watch the episode Till The Blood Runs Clear. Farscape's first season is available in VHS/DVD. When the genetic scientists came to Earth, an Orion royal female and a Sirian royal male were both in charge of the experiments on Earth. These two eventually formed the rebel group that I have mentioned elsewhere in Matrix 5. I suggest Robert Morning Sky's \"LA Transcript\" for more written details on this. There is FAR more on this topic in the Library on 27. I hope this new information on this ally of the Orion Empire will assist in your understanding in the nature of the Game. These are also sequential incarnations, as are all alien to Earthers are. As with Orion, they are not open to spiritual advancement, but rather Dark polarity control. Sirius/Orion Involvements As covered elsewhere in my material, Sirius is male dominated and Orion is female dominated. Due to their uneasy alliance because of Orion's superior technology, Sirius is the seat of Orion's dog soldiers (front line troops). Ancient Earth was the object of both Orion and Sirian genetic scientists. Both Sirius and Orion examples are found all over Earth today. Some are listed below. 82"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. The goddess (mary) worshipping church of Rome (Orion) started the Orion/Sirian conflict on Earth when it invaded Sirian (muslim) male dominated lands - the Crusades. This conflict is still on-going. The Protestant Revolution was Sirian incursion into Orion domination. This is even further complicated by the Orion queen and Sirian king in conflict with the rebel reptilian queen and rebel wolfish king who worked together to carve their own empire from the Orion Empire. The rebels, who are just as vicious as the Orion/Sirian royals, are now not only infighting, but also dealing with newer Orion and Sirian Empire factions. Orion factions include the catholic church, Greek/Russian orthodox, wicca and other religions who are primarily goddess oriented. Sirian factions include muslim, protestant, mormons and jews, all god oriented. Polygamy, still practiced by muslims and formerly by the mormons, is Sirian. Mormons, while they don't practice polygamy today, still believe in it. Their church teaches that in mormon heaven #1, ALL men will be polygamous with hundreds or thousands of wives all working in spiritual kitchens and having, although painlessly, spirit children while the god-husband creates worlds. This, of course, is pure mythology. Interestingly enough, catholics are the current largest practitioners of polygamy. ALL nuns wear a wedding ring. If you ask them why, they'll tell you that they are ‘brides of christ’, the biggest polygamist of ALL history. Divisions are even deeper between rebel queen/king and homeworld/Empire queen/king. Muslims are rebel king. Jews are homeworld/Empire king. Catholics are homeworld /Empire queen. The rebel queen’s representative, the Ninhursag - Elizabeth II, sides with the rebel king, hence England supports protestant (rebel king) Northern Ireland over catholic (homeworld/Empire queen) Ireland. Even so, sometimes lines blur and manipulations are extensive. This is a simplification, but you get the idea. Infighting is permitted within these groups by both Orion and Sirius. Motherlands are Orion oriented. Fatherlands are Sirian oriented. Conflicting parties, both Sirian factions - Israel and Arabs, were summoned to the White House under the Clinton administration for mediation. Why? The US is Orion faction. Orion is top cow in the alliance. The Orion US summons both Sirian factions to Washington and both dutifully come. Now why would the Arabs come since the US is overtly pro-Israel? Because Sirius submits to Orion dictates in most cases. This over simplifies something that could easily be written in a book as there are so many details and variables. Now with Bush jr in the White House, the tilt is to the rebel queen and Israel is held less in favor. Don't get overly caught up in these details as they can keep you from paying attention to your Path. Due to the planned return of the Orion queen, the DNA command sequence of female dominance became active in America, Canada and Great Britain in the second half of the 1800's. This has rapidly snowballed into the current situation we have today in Orion sponsored lands. The UN's Women’s Conference, held in 2000, pointed the Orion Finger at Sirian lands of male dominance to conform. EVENTUALLY THEY WILL HAVE TO. This will show Sirius taking second place to Orion. Although on the Sirius system, male dominance is permitted, as on other Sirian controlled planets, it is not permitted on planets claimed by Orion. Orion claims Earth. The time of the rebel confusion is almost over and Orion is once again exerting its control from Mintaka. There is FAR more that can be said about these matters. Use your own discernment. Both Sirian and Orion are of the body. This includes their religions.

Observation: The Truth Is (NOT) Out There I had watched the series finale of Earth Final Conflict today. The first four seasons were pretty good. This fifth and last season was terrible, with Orion DNA commands running rampant. At the end of the episode, one dead common, mid level Earther comments to another how everyone wants to know the answers to THE questions of life: 'Who are we?' and 'Why are we here?'. He says the answer has to be OUT THERE in space and they agree to go with the last Taelon to search OUT THERE for the answers. I guarantee that no Earther Higher Self incarnate can get the answers to these questions OUT THERE with the sequential incarnates! No way! Never! Looking externally for these answers is all a low, mid and lower through mid-Advanced level quest. Religions tell us to turn to external deities (already well covered in the M5 materials) and count on beLIEvers. This is necessary for your development AT THOSE STAGES to cause you to be restless at the empty answers you find. This is part of the Game and part of the alien efforts to keep Earther Higher Selves from finding the truth. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. In the mid-Advanced levels, restless activity reaches its climax with the abandoning of ALL religions, conventional/new age/ancient. The abandoning of beLIEf will easy your progression into the Very Advanced levels. him, I found the vast wealth of going within. This personal wealth is more valuable than anything external, yet you cannot access this wealth totally until your Awakened Final Incarnation, wherever shim may be in time. As you know from the many messages I've shared on this topic, once you have this access and knowledge, the Game has lost its control over you because you can no longer be manipulated by it. All the caveats of the Game, that I've discussed in M5 and beyond, become second nature to you. If you've read the materials, you know what I mean. If you haven't read the materials, you must do so if you want to know. The answers that the two, dead common mid levels want answered have been answered in Matrix 5. The answers are SO simple and easy to understand that they are rejected by the lesser Advanced because they want something complex, EXTERNAL and deity controlled. The 'someone to take care of me syndrome'. When they find out it’s ALL about themselves and their Path, it causes a radical readjustment of their thinking. Their Higher Self rejoices when shim's incarnations bridge this gap in the Game and begin the spiral out process. The X-Files has used the phrase 'The Truth Is Out There' for years. They want the viewers to look externally for their Path. The Game wants you to look without. When you are ready, finally ready, to hear the answers to the questions of the mysteries of life, you can receive them from your own Higher Self who can verify what I've written about them in Matrix 5. Matrix 5 should be used as a bridge to YOUR Higher Self and not the 'omega of all'.

Put your trust, as I've said over and over again, in YOUR Higher Self. TV Aliens and Earth Watching Star Trek, Andromeda and other science fiction shows and films, Earthers are being fed myths in regard to alien races. Each alien race on TV, such as Vulcan, Klingon, etc, is depicted as composed of the various sub-categories of races on Earth. We see white, black, oriental, etc Vulcans, for example. This is just not how it really is on alien planets. The REAL alien races are quite unique to each other and homogeneous - reptilian Orion, wolfish Sirian, Nordic Pleiadian, etc., do not come in a variety of sub-categories as do Earth humans. Orion differences are in winged for royals and non-winged for the rest. More examples: Billy Meier's Pleiadians from Erra are all Nordic appearing, while he also interacted with a woman from Deron where the people on that planet are of a black race. There is no such thing as a white or yellow Deronese. Yet Earther TV would like you to think so, even if it is science fiction. What's up with the Earth? Are the various races, currently on the planet, the original hodge­ podge of inhabitants? NO! I have touched on the original Earth humans in other writings, the pre-divided gender beings of the ancient past. They were not of the various sub- categories that we have had for millennia. [Ed.- See Ancient Earth - Loss of hinocence] The various human sub-categories of today on Earth are the result of tremendous alien genetic tampering experiments. True, they first began by splitting the Earth being into 2 genders, thus attacking the First Law of the Universe. This was part of Dark's plan. It is also a fallacy to think of race as being simply shades of skin color, since much more is involved. At one time, there were as many as 20 different types of races on Earth resulting from genetic experiments. Remnants of Earth's blue race are said to still exist hidden in southern Asia. In subsequent experiments, human genes were altered by adding reptilian Orion, wolfish Sirian and Earth ape genes (among others) into the newly genderized Earth human. They also mixed human and animal genes. This still goes on today in the Dulce genetics labs. As a point of interest, the ban on eating pork by certain religious groups as being 'unclean' is NOT due to ‘a dirty animal’, but rather because there are human genes in pork and pork is said to taste like human. Another genetically created animal is the cat, which has reptilian components (eyes and hisses like a snake/lizard). These are both from Atlantean genetic experiments. [Ed.- Cats have blood types A, B and AB, similar to some humans.] While there were about 20 different human sub-categories, the first one created was for heavy labor in the mines for their alien masters. By incorporating Orion, Sirian and a significant amount of ape genes, the Empire had it's first slave race which are, in modern times, today's Africans. Through time, black Africans have been a slave race to more than the aliens. They were, unfortunately, slaves to Egypt, Arabs and western European Christians. The ROOT of ail this trouble comes from the alien genetic scientists. This race had a specific purpose for the aliens, but not all races did. Most of the other races were just experimentation prompted by genetic curiosity. The European white race turned out to be quite vicious. While they have been able to conquer other races around the globe, no other race has been successful in returning the MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition 85"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"'favor'. The Huns of Asia and the Turks and the Arabs were all halted in their expansions when they took on Europe. Through inter-racial breeding, the traits of the races have crossed over. A majority of American blacks have European traits because of being forced to breed with Christian slave owners. It is not necessary to go into more detail on this, although, if interested, the Library on Monroe Focus Level 27 has enough details to satisfy the most demanding Virgo. Another item of interest - dark hair and brown eyes are native to Earth humans. Eyes other than brown and hair other than dark are of alien origin. Also, if the RH factor of your blood is negative, such as B- or 0 -, there is an alien factor in your blood. The point is that if the Orion and Sirian Empires hadn't tampered with Ancient Earth, this planet would not be where it is today. The other point is the Earth human of today is an artificial creation. If TV/film aliens strove for accuracy, their aliens would be each of a single race per planet, but then TV tries to lure the viewer into false senses of security, conformity and superiority. It just is not so. There are many wonderful aliens and many vicious aliens with all kinds in between. However, the Game is full of illusions and deceptions that Dominant and, especially, Final Incarnations must see for what they are. Remember also that you are NOT your body and, to be awakened, you must eliminate the body/race/gender identification from your knowledge of who you really are. Observation: Higher Self Intervention On TV The Sci-Fi channel had 2 new documentaries on television this past weekend. One was a 2 hour update on Roswell which included a \"smoking gun\". This was General Ramey's memo, held in his hand, when he's posing with the faked weather balloon materials. They didn't count on future technology being able to read that memo. It includes a reference to a \"disk\" and \"victims\". This, in itself, is worth seeing, although they don't show it until near the end of the 2 hours. The rest of the program is loaded with the usual government threats to witnesses and a rehash of the Roswell materials. The Roswell event is 55 years old. With the impending return of the Orion Empire, there is an increase in interest in Roswell/aliens and lots of War of the Worlds, V, etc., being shown on television. It seems that rarely a week goes by when I don't see War of the Worlds on one channel or another. The companion documentary on Sci-Fi immediately followed the Roswell program. This one centers on abductions ( Abduction Diaries). The most interesting one involves a middle aged woman who certain aliens were tampering with. Once, when they were threatening her, a glowing being came in and drove the aliens out. The being referred to shimself as \"we\" when communicating to the woman. This was a Higher Self intervention. The \"we\" is most likely the Dominant Incarnations of that Higher Self. The Higher Self will intervene if any situation threatens the path/experiences that the Higher Self has chosen for an incarnation. This is a part of the Game given to simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves. When the Higher Self intervenes in such a dramatic manner as demonstrated in this documentary, aliens will scatter. The intervention can come to ANY of the Higher Selfs incarnations. The Higher Self has shim's plan for the entire Game and knows each incarnations partin that plan.

The sequential incarnates, as you know from the Matrix 5 materials, have interfered/ tampered with Earthers for a LONG time. Once the situation of the Game was set and the simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves joined in the Game, the aliens have been attempting to throw a monkey wrench in the works and try to ruin it for the simultaneous. Most of the time, this has been looked on as a challenge by the simultaneous Higher Selves and something they can overcome or adapt to. BUT, when the sequentials try something that would be impossible to overcome without direct Higher Self intervention (such as pre­ mature death), where the something involves stopping the Advancement, the Higher Self WILL undertake a direct intervention. If you are able to watch the Sci-Fi channel, take a look at this intervention. Observation: Taken (Special Gold Edition Segment) Sci-fi channel is broadcasting the new, 10 part mini-series Taken. As of this writing, I’ve watched the first 2 episodes. The heightened alien exposure on tv and film indicates something is probably 'up' with the aliens (see other alien-related segments of Matrix V). Sci-fi channel said their November 02 two hour update special on Roswell, followed by Abduction Diaries, garnered them very high ratings and placed these programs in the top 10 of the week. Refer to my segment on these two November programs. Now it's Taken. Previews were advertised for at least 6 months. Stephen Spielberg is the person behind Taken and it shows in the production. Sci-fi reruns its programs. If you miss the first run, they usually rerun it several times. * Taken opened with a highly interesting scene in the first episode. This was not repeated in the second episode. The whole tv screen begins as white. It moves slowly out to reveal 2 stars. Next is another full white screen and a brighter, more impressive star shows as the view retreats. What they are showing is the belt of the constellation Orion. The third, more impressively displayed star (right side) is Mintaka, home star of the Orion Empire! The Orion belt is even at the correct angle of increasing from left to right. How interesting that the focus is on the reptilian queen's royal star. The camera moves next through the asteroid belt. The asteroid belt is what remains of the planet destroyed by the Orion/Sirian Empires ages ago. After this is Earth's Moon, then Earth itself. The implication, for those who know, is that the asteroid belt should serve as a reminder to Earthers that this can be their fate as well. Why didn't they move from Mintaka directly to Earth? The lesson is not so significant. The Orion Empire, although preferring not to create another asteroid belt where Earth is, would not hesitate to do so if the reptilians thought this was their only option. With an eye to the future and what I know, I can say that the Earth, despite what the reptilians and their allies may plan, will not wind up as another asteroid belt at their whim. Another message in this opener is that Orion is returning. If you haven't seen the opening scene of the first episode, make sure you watch it when it reruns. Also, I suggest taping it, then running the tape slowly to catch all that I've mentioned. It is more dramatic when you see Mintaka, glowing as they have it, in slow mode. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved, *Next that I want to draw your attention to is the type of Grey aliens (Sheti) that has been shown in the first two episodes. This was not the type of alien that crashed in Roswell, but this is the type that the government wants you to focus on. They are part of the Orion Empire. The Grey shown in these episodes is a violent type. Also note the man in the small room where they are holding the alien. He's chanting away in Hebrew. The interesting tie here is there is the \"Jehovah” alien group that has a distinct interest in the Israelis. Draw your own conclusions here­ in episode two, the giant squirrel tricks one boy into following him. This is a common alien trick is used especially on children in the abduction scenarios. Taken shows it well. Read Mati'ix II for much more on the aliens and this type of trickery. This carries over to the astral with some of the recently dead. I am referring to the Light Trap and the creation of images to lure the newly dead into a false sense of security. Read my previous segment on this subject and refer to Matrix II for even more. *Early on in episode two, we are taken to Groom Lake in 1958. There is a lot of information on Groom Lake - volumes. Pay attention to the 2 aircraft in the scene as the evil Army officer, Owen the murder/traitor, is walking to the hangar with his Nazi scientist. When you look at those craft, you will see they are not the simple jets of the 50's. Groom Lake is a real hive of activity above and, more so, below the ground. *One lesson that you see over and over in the two parts is that you should NEVER trust the government. The military (as well as political officials) take oaths to protect the country from enemies \"foreign and domestic\". This is a farce. They are only interested in protecting their own interests (and, more so, those above them) and not the people. In the latter 4o's when the Roswell event happened, people still beLIEved that the government was there to help the people. Yet, the eyewitnesses of the Roswell event and related were routinely threatened by the government which excels in lies and denials for their own interests. This is another topic you can find so much on and David Icke's materials are great on this. 1 will be giving more observations on Taken as it progresses. Meanwhile, watch and observe! Observation: Taken - Second Commentary (Special Gold Edition Segment) The Sci-Fi Channel's series, Taken , is really a major series on abduction and sequential alien tampering in modern Earther lives. Part 7 of 10 is the latest shown. Here are my comments since my observations on parts 1 and 2: * \"We would never do anything to harm a civilian. We would never do anything to a civilian against his will.\" So said the Dark government representative, Owen Crawford, who murders whenever he found it suited his purpose. Over and over you see how the government lies, kills and imprisons those who they want or who interfere with their Dark agenda. The statements they make about 'never harm' are really laughable. The government WILL do anything to anyone they want to. The government will do anything to a civilian that is against the civilian's will if it suits their purpose. The government is NOT your friend, nor is it looking out for your best interests. If you think it is, you aren't even ready to scan the index of Matrix 5! It is in the Advanced stages that you learn of the government's extremely Dark nature and insidious deceptions. When this occurs, you have begun to see things as they really are.

All Rights Reserved. *Shape shifting and other alien technological trickery play through the series. Aliens shape shift to look like others to gain one's confidence. Aliens shape shift into humans. This is all very true. Alien craft, in this series, disguised to look like a circus truck, a restaurant or other harmless Earther object in order to not alert the abductee. Alien shape shifting is discussed in Matrix 5 and in David Icke's books. This is a reality and it is common. Your Higher Self is well aware of what is really going on, but the Game must go on. *Note the prominence of red and blond haired women that the aliens deal with. This is significant. I suggest, if you are interested in knowing more about this, check David Icke’s site, www.davidicke.com , and check out Arizona Wilder's video tape where the blond/red hair figures prominently with the reptilians. Red hair is most valued by them for their ritual purposes. *The abilities that Allie shows are Higher Self manifestations that would NOT occur, except in the rarest of cases, on 3rd density. They would like you to believe that by mixing Orion allied Grey with Earther human genetics, a ‘super being’ would exist. This is NOT true. This is what the aliens would like us to believe, however. Not only that, but they want us to believe that the alien genes are superior, when, in actuality, they are inferior. This ‘blending of alien/human’ is part of the sequential Higher Selves moving against the sijnultaneous Higher Selves in the Game. This is part of their attempts to move Earth out of the simultaneous path and into the sequential path. The mass teleportation at will by Allie at the end of the 7th part just would not happen as shown. This is part of the deception of merging alien with Earther physical bodies. Nothing magical would happen. It’s the alien technology 2-step, smoke and mirrors deception to keep Earthers in awe of aliens and their technological dog and pony shows. *They continually hint that the government does not know as much as people think they do. Actually, the government knows MUCH more than people think they do. There is more going on with Taken than they would like you to believe. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Observation: Taken - Final Notes (Special Gold Edition Segment) The 10th and final part of Taken just aired on the Sci-Fi channel. For those who have yet to watch the series, be sure and have your crying tissues for the last half hour. Taken is not a real story. There is no real Allie or any other of these characters, although some characters are based on real people. When you see the show, you should be able to see who I mean, especially the man in the mobile, 4am radio broadcasting mobil home. Some features of the end part of the series to note: ^Several people, in the show, marvel at Allie's ability to \"manifest though\" in the physical. What Allie does, primarily the huge alien show seen in Part 8, would be something that a Higher Self could easily do, but would not do via an Earther physical. This is part of a deceptive idea that the sequential aliens would prefer Earthers to beLIEve. \"This is the next step in the evolution of life\", one person states talking about Allie. What you should easily notice here is that EVERYONE in this series is totally wrapped up in external and body ID matters. That is where the aliens are and where they want us to be. As for manifesting thought, we all do that all the time. Our thoughts manifest on the astral which is one reason why the lower astral is so cluttered. It is part of our ability as Higher Selves that shines 89 I"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"through even the many filters the aliens installed in our Earther bodies. Also, when you are on the astral, you have instant gratification by making whatever you desire to manifest. Watch the film, What Dreams May Come, to see some great illustrations of this. *Time manipulation - This was demonstrated several times in the series, but the largest display was at the end of Part 7 when Allie shifted a group of people out of time for over 2 hours. This is another Higher Self ability. The aliens have versions of this that are technologically, not naturally, generated. The problem with these displays of abilities by Allie is that they are tying ALL of this to a merging of Earther and alien physical bodies. THIS IS A LIE! They would like you to believe that the aliens are some 'masters of Higher Self powers'. This is just not the case. Our Higher Selves move through time as simultaneous incarnations as easily as you move from one room to another. It has nothing to do with physical bodies or technology. *People, in the series, talk about how \"advanced\" the aliens are, all the time bowing to their technological superiority. I have been warning about this throughout Matrix V. \"We are so behind where they are, but where Allie is 'shows the future' and where we are going\" - yeah, right. The aliens admit that they are 'emotionally challenged', so to say. They claim they have 'no emotions' but are astounded by the wide range of Earther human emotions. Yes, indeed. It's not that they have 'no emotions' as the series stated, it’s that most have survival emotions only - fear, anger, hate, etc. The aliens have widely commented on Earther emotional ranges. This is due to the simultaneous nature of our Path. As I have said elsewhere in Matrix V segments, the aliens have been trying to duplicate the benefits of the simultaneous path using technology. They are trying to have their cake and eat it too. This particular goal will NOT be reached and their efforts are in vain. They aren't spiritually Advanced enough to recognize that, so they keep trying. *\"A thousand voices talking at once\" is what Allie's mother said when she tries to mentally tune in to the aliens. These are Grey aliens and they have a hive mind. This was also demonstrated with Star Trek's Borg collective. The hive mentality is the height of conformity and an icon of several sequential alien groups. Individuality is not found with these types. *What is it with all that red hair in this series? In an earlier observation of Taken, I mention the high visibility of blondes and red heads. Blondes are dirt common today with females, but not because they are natural. Statistics say that only 1 in 20 is a natural blonde. Red hair is even less common, but in Taken, they were seen among several of the main characters. Again I refer you to Arizona Wilder's video tape, from the David Icke site, to discover the importance of these two colored hairs. The reptilians particularly have a use for these people. *The sacred, alien-Earther, female child - This has been seen before almost 20 years ago in another mini-series, V and V - The Final Battle. In this case it was the 'star child' born of an Earther female and a reptilian male. 'Mystical powers' were hers to command. Rent these 2 mini-series for the whole show. The 'star child' and Allie are both supposed to be held up for awe by Earthers. In both cases, Orion Empire reptilians and Greys are involved in breeding. Also notice that it is the female icon both times. This is the Orion Empire propaganda for Earther consumption. After all, the Empire is female-ruled. This (female icon) is, of course, the opposite of such major manifestations since it is the male body that is the generator of energies.

This called for loads of long hugs from her parents in attempts to recharge her batteries. Charlie, her father, was the source of energy for both females. When mumsie used her energy up, she needed to run to Charlie to recharge. Charlie was the 'electrical outlet’ for both females. Remember the Matrix V materials when you observe the propaganda. This was a very well done series. I’m sure that many of you will be able to glean a lot of interesting observations on your own from Taken..It seems that the main points that they want you to accept are: - The aliens are hopelessly more advanced than Earthers - Earthers benefit when breeding with aliens even though it can be disturbing at the time - The aliens are so advanced that they \"lost\" their ability to have a full range of emotions - The aliens are so innocent acting in their abductions/manipulations of Earthers - Surrender interpretations of whatever you are not ready to comprehend or deal with, as of yet, to the aliens who can handle it better since they want us to believe that they are spiritually superior. - The government is vile and cannot be trusted, (this IS true) - The aliens will help us in our next steps in evolution Other than the government point, the others are PURE sequential alien deceptions. I have been warning that they intend to make Earth a sequential planet and deny our simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves a place in this galaxy. Remember that propaganda is not limited to government and religions. The aliens also engage in huge propaganda manipulations on Earth. Taken is one of them presented in semi-fictional theatrics. Very interesting series. You never know what you may find hidden in there. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Revelation: Abduction Bottom Line (Special Gold Edition Segment) With Sci-Fi's mini-series Taken, Abduction Diaries, and countless other alien abduction films, books, etc., the creation of hybrid beings composed of Earther human and alien (Grey and reptilian) is reported over and over. You don't hear of other types of aliens engaged in this activity. Why? In Matrix V segments, I have mentioned that one of the considerations that the Orion Empire is seriously contemplating for Earth is the destruction of the current planetary occupants to be replaced with another. I've also discussed the Ancient Earthers in contact with the Orion/Sirian Empire's genetic scientists and what occurred there. Now for- something you haven't heard yet - the purpose of these hybrid experiments is to search for and attempt to create a new form of life to take up residence on Earth after Earther humans have been ‘disposed of, and they have no intention of telling you that. The Greys (Sheti) work for the reptilians. The purpose of the abductions is to analyze and get samples from many Earthers in order to use what the aliens find \"useful\" from the current population to incorporate into the next intended residents. Forget the old 'dying race' crap that the Greys like to use to trigger sympathy for them with Earthers. That is a smoke screen. The hybrids they create are not the final product they desire, but they are a step in the direction that they seek. Hybrids are further manipulated, but this is not viewed by Earthers. 91"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Another goal of this hybridization project is yet another attempt to duplicate simultaneous incarnation benefits without taking the simultaneous path. In a previous segment, I told you that the aliens are not spiritually mature enough to realize that this is impossible. This, however, doesn't keep them from trying. The aliens in Taken want us to beLIEve that they don't think they are harming us, that they are just innocently having their way with Earthers they abduct. The idea is ‘I do it because I want to, and fuck the rest of you’. The Sheti serve the Empire and you are supposed to serve the Sheti. ALL abductions are Dark polarity, but then that is what the Orion/Sirian Empires are. In the Taken series, Allie says 'you have to look at it from their (alien) point of view' and how important it is for them to abduct Earthers. Yeah, it is important for them to obey their Orion mistresses! They are also under Orion orders to develop a new being to inhabit Earth ‘once the planet becomes sequential’ and the simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves have departed. Once again aliens are duping Earthers to serve the Empire. Now you know more of why. Genetics: A Sequential Obsession (Special Gold Edition Segment) We get blasted about genetics, genetic engineering, hybrid experiments, etc., from all the trumpets of society/government/entertainment and so on. It was the obsession with genetics that brought the aliens here to experiment on the Ancient Earthers. Since those days, Earther royalty has been centered around genetics in the form of the 'correct' marriage. This was to keep reptilian lines and alliances mingling on Earth from being tainted by non-royals. More recently, Hitler was fanatical about genetics and the 'perfect Aryan' being in Europe. Since World War II, America, having imported many German scientists after WWII, has been wanting more and more genetic knowledge. This lead to agreements with certain Dark alien groups for genetic technology and certain underground bases primarily in the US southwest. Today, for example, we have various forms of cloning acknowledged in public even though it has been going on for decades. Foods are genetically enhanced. The passion is to ‘extend human life’. Fear death! Do the 'approved' regimens of diet and exercise. Take the 'approved' drugs for every minor inconvenience in life. Death is bad, so deny that it will come to you. If you do what we say, you will live longer. THOSE are the mantras of the sequential aliens and one area where they are currently active on Earth. The Sci-Fi mini-series, Taken, had the aliens trying various cookbook type genetic experiments on Earthers. Star Trek Nemesis is themed around genetics and a clone. The drum beats of genetics and cloning are everywhere. The hope of those ultimately behind this is that Earthers will embrace these methods and the sequential path. These give away your power to the body and to those who would keep you on body ID. These are more traps set by sequentially incarnating aliens to attempt to derail the simultaneously incarnating. This genetic mindset is an Orion Empire mainstay. You do not hear anything about spiritual development in the genetic circles for genetics is their god.

The aliens have other goals with their hybrid experiments which are touched on in another segment. Youth and beauty are co-partners with genetics. The news reported that it will be possible to replace your face with another (dead) person's face. ALL of this shit is sequential aliens fucking with Earthers. Unfortunately, most Earthers are buying into it. Come on, EndGame! Minion incarnations will buy this lock, stock and barrel. Low through low-Advanced levels will dabble with various facets of this rhinestone ’gem’. Yes, there are experiences here, but they are ALL of a low level. This is not a lure to the Very Advanced and above. It is the spirit that animates a body that is the deciding force in what occurs, despite genetics. A mid-Advanced level incarnation can do wonders with a genetically poor physical. An Advanced incarnation can overcome any obstacles to succeed in shim's path. Whoopie Goldberg was a welfare mother in her youth. Her incarnating spirit via her Higher Self gave her what she needed to move beyond the limitations of environment and genetics. Remember that the aliens created the black race as a slave race. Whoopie's incarnating spirit didn't let that stop her. The poor Eastern European who came to the US in 1914 with only a few dollars and turned that into a comfortable, mid-Advanced level life could not have done it if genetics or 'station in life’ were factors to limit. The severely crippled man becomes a prominent scientist. Fuck genetics! The examples can go on and on. You will hear more and more about these topics from all quarters of the Game. They will be proven futile. Atlantis had similar obsessions in its latter days too. It didn’t save them or their life routines. The only verifiable growth comes in spiritual Advancement and that means NOT giving vour power awav to anvone or any.organization. Develop your spiritual self. Remember, your death and manner of death was set by your Higher Self, thus you, before you incarnated. Alien Visitors to Earth Alien visitors to Earth are not on the simultaneous incarnational path that Earther Higher Selves are experiencing. There are several types of alien visitors, not all reptilian, who are freely moving around observing Earthers in their natural habitat. These either look enough like Earth humans to pass or who have disguised themselves to pass. Many tend to be very telepathic and can pick up thoughts directed to them. Similarly, an Earth native who is taken to another planet does not lose the simultaneous experience. These are controlled by the Higher Self, once shim has chosen the path shim desires. Several people claim certain aliens are from the 5th density. Creation is NOT conforming to what Earth people believe OR what aliens believe. Just because they arrive with lofty sounding ideas and fancy ships doesn't mean they know more that everyone here. The more they rely on technology, the less they rely on spirituality. One thing to remember, unless you've heard from the aliens themselves OR have personally been to the 5th density, I suggest you remain skeptical of what you hear. The popular aliens are notorious for sneaking around Earth and choosing problem-ridden contactees rather than using other methods to deliver their messages. Earthers are being programmed with a wide variety of alien propaganda. ALL aliens have their agendas, and I do mean ALL. There are a lot of mazes for Earthers to get lost in.

If enough dog and pony shows can be presented, they believe you will never go within. Earthers with Higher Selves need to pay less attention to these circus acts and more attention to Self.

Denial of Information & Sequential Incarnates (Special Gold Edition Segment) In Matrix 5, the quarantine of Earth by the sequential aliens and the endless meddling by these same aliens on Earth have been discussed. This segment deals with another area that the sequential aliens are exerting control - the dissemination of information. It is well known that the American government is paranoid about telling the people-just about anything that doesn't enhance their agendas. The too often used phrase, 'national security', is the cover for this paranoia. Keeping in mind all the other sequential alien information that I have given you, remember that denial of the existence of aliens and alien activity is currently still essential to the intent of isolating simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves on Earth. If you were foolish or naive enough to believe the government, the Roswell incident never happened, no aliens ever visited Earth, Atlantis is a myth and the Egyptian Great Pyramid is a tomb for some pharaoh. 'Swamp gas' was another favorite delusion of the government in referring to alien craft observations. The list of outright lies is endless and continues to grow in leaps and bounds under the current, fascist Bush dictatorship. But then what else would you expect from reptilian/alien rule? Minion incarnations will blindly obey the government. Low and Mid level incarnations will obey to varying degrees as part of the experiences required by their Higher Selves. Advanced level incarnates will be anywhere from questioning of the government line to outright discarding what the government says as tainted and manipulative. You can wonder why they don't reveal alien information to the general public. The lame excuse is that 'people will panic'. 'Keep them unaware' is their motto. Instead of being truthful to the public, they are keeping this perceived panic in check UNTIL the aliens arrive. They are counting on this panic and fear so that the public can be controlled with an alien arrival because the belief is that the public will give anything for the fear to be removed. The government has had decades to get the public use to alien realities. They have no interest in doing so. The people who buck the government bullshit are simultaneous path Higher Selves who will not be deterred by the alien/sequential planetary rulers. The government will use whatever means they can to attempt to ridicule people who want to KNOW. Currently on Showtime pay television, comic magicians Penn & Teller have a show called 'Bullshit'. In the first few episodes, they ridicule alien contact, reflexology, chiropractic doctors and more. These comics are 2 crabs attempting to pull any other crab, who wants to leave the bucket, back into conformity. Penn & Teller almost always pull fringe elements to 94"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

No, that's institution and approved, but alternative medicine will get full grief from their narrow minds. Consider that the powers that be are using comic magicians to use their brand of sleight of hand on the public once again. Just as their main act is an illusion, they continue to present illusions in this show. This is just one current example of control being exerted on the simultaneous so that they resist Awakening. This, of course, also grossly underestimates the will of simultaneous Higher Selves. These are just more rocks on the Rocky Road. Nothing can stop the progression of simultaneous Higher Selves. The planetary quarantine is inconsequential as it is based on keeping average sequential incarnates away from Earth. The alien meddling on Earth, while placing many rocks on our path has only tempered the simultaneous incarnates to be stronger. Knowing that the planetary controllers are either outright alien or human collaborators (watch the film, They Live ) means you learn not to trust the government or the military. They have the sequential aliens' agendas as their 'orders'. This boulder on the Rocky Road is part of you regaining all your power from external sources and learning to trust in your own Higher Self first and foremost. A Deeper Look: Alien Semantics There is a known alien group who tells their contactee that they are from the 5th/6th density. Of course with this kind of pronouncement, the Earther, in awe of the massive alien technology and alien mystique is SO impressed. It's time for a Deeper Look. From where I discovered the Higher Selves residing, while engaging in the 3rd density experience, it corresponds, using the Monroe level guidelines, to the 5th/6th density. When I went outside my Higher Self, I saw numerous other Higher Selves ALL with hundreds of extensions from them to the 3rd/4th densities. From this I've gathered that those engaging in the Earther simultaneous experience are \"near\" each other, probably for communications between themselves when necessary. So, since our Higher Selves are on the 5th/6th density, if you were to proceed to other areas of that frequency, you would come to other Higher Selves (FAR more of them) having their sequential incarnational experiences in The Game. Since their memories are intact from one incarnation to another, they know far more than they are ever to reveal to an Earther Higher Self incarnation. Hell, they even quarantine the planet to try and keep us localized (as per other revelations on this topic from me). They know that if they choose to interact (for whatever reason) with Earthers, we wouldn't have a clue about where they are coming from BEFORE Matrix 5 and subsequent materials were released. So, when they say, \"We're from the 5th/6th density\" (accompanied by a celestial choir, no doubt), don't be deceived. Instead say, \"The hell you say, so am I!\". Then you can also add, \"I chose to handle the simultaneous incarnational path, the fast track. Don't worry, you'll eventually catch up.\" I tell you, you were not supposed to be aware of this while still incarnated on Earth until your Final Incarnation and this is the first Final Incarnation who has the nerve to provide this important window in the Game (near Endgame). They successfully try to wow Earthers with technology and exotic appearances (in most cases) and this works unless one is in the VERY Advanced stages of their Path. You notice that all the contactees are either uneducated (easy to mold) or upper mid-level or low- M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 95"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Advanced level types who won't ask the HARD questions of them. They would steer clear of Dominant Incarnations, Very Advanced Incarnations and, especially, Awakened Final Incarnations. This group, like all other alien groups, has dazzling technologies and ships. Higher density beings do NOT need these things since will alone makes things happen. These aliens have home worlds, alliances/enemies, clothing and all other necessities of 3rd density existence. Don't be taken in by the double talk of ‘sth/6th density’. This information will be of great assistance to your Dominant and Final Incarnations no matter where they are in time. This knowledge is part of the Endgame scenario. Alien Labels: 'Reincarnation' & 'Past Lives' (Special Gold Edition Segment) If you have read all Matrix 5 segments, you are familiar with sequential and simultaneous incarnational labels and what makes them so. The terms 'reincarnation' and 'past lives' have been around for quite a while. They seem to originate with hindu, buddhist and other Asian religions. These terms are totally inaccurate for Earther Higher Selves. We are simultaneously incarnating on this path. It is only sequential incarnates who have past lives or ‘reincarnate’. The term 'past life' indicates a sequence of progression through incarnations. Lightsiders love those words. You can always hear them babble about \"in my last incarnation\" or \"in my next incarnation\". This is sequential terminoloev. This exists as a direct result of aliens passing along their path traits to Earthers who are their followers/genetic creations. On a deeper level, it is part of the Game and attempts to delay your discovery of your true nature and the simultaneous path of Earther Higher Selves. Earther Higher Selves do not have past and future incarnations. Non-Earther Higher Selves do. All Earther Higher Self incarnations occur simultaneously in different frequencies referred to as 'time periods'. Remember that linear time does NOT exist. Time is so played with on Earth that it is easy to see the fallacy of it. War time, daylight savings time, standard time, double summer time, etc all demonstrate that the keeping of time is artificial since it is changeable by laws made on Earth. For example: Arizona does not have daylight savings time but Utah does. It can be 3:00 in Utah and 2:00 in Arizona even though one state is geographically on top of the other. However, in the fall when Daylight time ceases to exist, both states are on the same Mountain Standard Time. Time keeping on Earth can be quite messy. It is very artificial. If time were a fixed item, silly laws by silly people would not be able to change it. Many Asians and other followers of karmic style religions, fear what their next incarnational status will be, so they tend to mold their lives around this fear. You know about 'fear' and control from previous Matrix 5 segments. This fear keeps these people from developing properly. Karmic religions are very dead end and deceptive to the incarnate who has not matured enough to see them for what they are. I remember one of my astrology teachers being mad at another woman and saying, \"it'll take her 1,000 incarnations to make that up to me\". She's a fool. Karma, like time, is artificial. The good news is that karma and past life types will eventually advance beyond these stages. Favorite 'bad boys' from modern history, Hitler, Stalin, etc are not being 'punished' for their experiences, but have moved on to other things in other incarnations they are having.

All Rights Reserved. not understand this, but then you should also not be reading Matrix 5 materials. It's way out of your league. If you still cling to 'karma', you are clinging to alien philosophies. Karma, if it were genuine, would only work with a sequential path of incarnations and never with a simultaneous path. How could karma exist if all your incarnations are occurring simultaneously? It can't, ‘Karmic astrology' involves reading a horoscope for information on other lives of that person. They teach that the 12th house refers to \"last incarnation\" while the 2nd house refers to \"next incarnation\". This is also a sequential incarnate philosophy and could very well work for them. BUT what applies to sequential incarnates does not apply to simultaneous. I would sooner say that the 12th house brings experiences from other lives of your Higher Self to play in your current incarnation. Knowing what you know now, you should react differently to hearing the terms 'past lives' and 'reincarnation'. Earther Higher Selves do not reincarnate. You can't ‘reincarnate’ once you have chosen the simultaneous route. It's a mismatch in terms. Don't be deceived. Observations — Aliens and the Higher Self \"When are the aliens coming to save us?\" was one question I was asked many times when I taught classes. Earthers are ALWAYS looking for some external savior, whether it be the non-existent jesus or some alien group. I'll have several questions in this writing for you to think about. First of all, why do aliens groups, who claim to have such important messages for Earthers, always choose representatives who are loaded down with personal problems or little education or who just put them on a pedestal believing every word that drops from their lips ? Meier in Switzerland has been dealing with aliens from Erra in the one of the Pleiadian systems. Meier never completed grade school and is dazzled by the alien technology . He refers to Earthers as 'lowly worms' and the Errans do nothing to discourage this. Other aliens groups contact people with loads of personal problems and huge amounts of fear. My response is that IF what you aliens have to tell us is SO damned important, why can’t you choose someone who has an intellect and, more importantly, is spiritually advanced enough to ask you the proper question and NOT take what you say solely on/ace value? How many times have you heard of aliens talking about Higher Selves and matters beyond 3rd density concerns? The main reason for us on Earth is to discover who we are through experience. It is the connecting with your Higher Self and spiraling beyond the 3rd/4th density muck that should be your goals. However the aliens don't talk about this. Why? Aren't they all they're cracked up to be? They love to charm their Earther supplicant with wonderful shows of technology, yet the more one relies on technology, the less likely they will look inward to the true source. Val tells me last night that since the Andromedans say they come from the 4th/sth density, they imply “technology must be there too”. This is an incorrect assumption, but one that an Earther would normally deduce. The Andromedans have also had plenty to say on events supposedly to happen on Earth and they just haven't happened. In view of this, why would anyone believe anything they say JUST because they say it??? MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition 97"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Another blurb from the Andromedan group’ is that they, or someone from the ‘Andromedan Council’, will intervene on Earth AFTER someone in the Middle East explodes a nuke. My question is, what is the alien motive if they wait until AFTER a nuke goes off to intervene? Why do so many people have to die and the planet get radiated before they show? For the experience? Yes, it will be an experience, but IF they claim to know what will happen AND they claim to be benevolent, why would they delay their arrival until after such a huge disaster? They have their own agenda. I remember when the aliens were saying that they were ‘waiting to be invited’ to intervene on Earth. Just send us this astral message and we'll come. The astral message was sent and they saw it. Did they come? NO!...and I doubt they had any intention of coming. Therefore, what's this game they're playing? The different alien groups love to play their Earther shill like a puppet to see just what they can get away with. It's not the Orion reptilians that play these games, but other alien groups. Reptilians do not play games. All this stuff aside, the alien lure is just a lure to get you from paying attention to your Higher Self. I find it interesting for these ‘superior’ acting aliens to never talk about the Higher Self. They talk about many Light polarity issues, but I've never come across any Balance issues from them. They are wrapped up in their wars with the Orion Empire as well as with other beings not yet mentioned on Earth. Getting alien information IS interesting and I'd love to discuss cultures and ideas with them, but just because they have neat technology should never blind you to who you are. I can travel beyond the galaxy in a blink without a space ship of any kind. The aliens come spouting all kinds of information, yet hide themselves from all except their chosen minion follower. Why is that? Do they fear REAL questions and examinations by those who have experiences that they don't seem to have had? They obviously fear something by not being public. It’s just a cop-out to use the 'we can't interfere' line of crap. They've already interfered by contacting one person and getting him to spread their messages. The Orion Empire has been helping themselves overtly and covertly for thousands of years to Earth and the humans here. Where were all these self-proclaimed enlightened aliens all through this period? We have to look on the alien issues as interesting, but a lure to get sidetracked into a loop that will keep you away from your purpose on Earth and your goal. Listen to the info their lackey spews. Evaluate it as best you can, then go on with your life and your inner development. Any aliens who claim to be able to help Earthers, but only after some awful disaster, are not as good as you'd like to believe. You should be tired of aliens coming from their ivory towers telling Earthers how they should be living and what they should be doing. Every Higher Self has shim's own path, which is unique. My Higher Selfs path is different than yours, however there are enough basics to follow so that you know you're listening to your Higher Self and not some alien guru. Make sure you put aliens and their perspectives in proper place to your own. Stop looking for saviors of any kind for only YOU can ‘save’ yourself and that you is your Higher Self!

If you have this book, pay attention to pg 368 - Micro-chipped population. This Event is well under way for full implementation, and you should know about it ahead of time to help you decide on your personal course of action, if any. There are some hefty movements to have all of David's books removed from bookshelves. Go to his site for more info on that (davidicke.com). I suggest getting this book while you can. It shines the light on some hefty segments of the Game on 3rd density earth. There are some errors in David's assumptions, but those of Very Advanced levels and up should have no problem discerning them. Icke is serving as a major source of Game info, but he is challenging the Game and battles it. This will eventually be his undoing as the Game does have ways of dealing with that type of aggression. Stick to the observing mode and personal Advancement and spiraling out of the Game, but resist challenging it directly. The key here is to end YOUR participation in the Game and not to try to undo the Game's purpose as many Lightsiders are trying to vainly do. I've said before that Icke has errors in his materials, among them that ‘all the aliens are from 4th density on Earth’. I've just uncovered in his Children of the Matrix book (pg 399), one that is at least as seriously flawed. With it he's playing the Game and doesn't even realize it. That's those Lightsiders. Here it is: \"I wrote earlier about how, when two polarities, male and female, are fused together it creates a third force of fantastic creative potential that can take us vibrationally out of the Matrix mode.\" Cheese & crackers. What a bunch of Game bullshit that is. That comes directly out of the alien DNA command structure ! This falsely assumes that there are male and female spirits, which is what the Game wants Earthers to believe. It also denies that every spirit is BOTH male and female and needs NO 'fusing' to become whole. It also leads one to believe you can’t succeed in spiraling out ‘without the opposite gender’ when just the opposite is true. It's awakening to your whole, true nature that will allow you to spiral out, not looking for another external savior (the opposite gender) which will do more harm than good in the long run, especially in Advanced stages, but you have to discover this on your own. More: \"For this reason, the Illuminati have worked furiously over thousands of years to keep male and female apart and maintain the duality.\" What!!?! The planetary rulers INSISTED on creating genders then REQUIRED/FORCED them together to short out Higher Self functions. That whole sentence of his is one of the most absurd I've ever read from him and far worse than ‘all problem Earther aliens are 4th density’. He continues on with his Lightsider flawed philosophy but it's terribly wrong. He is where he is and Lightsiders LOVE to pontificate BUT he doesn't realize that what he's doing here is to greatly assist the Game by throwing in a MAJOR dead end that will delay his readers in spiraling out. That’s why I say although his books are excellent, you must be on your spiritual toes when reading them.

Observation on David Icke's View of Reptilian Presence David Icke constantly refers to the reptilians as being ‘4th density possessing human bodies’ on one hand, then on the other talks about how they ‘shape-shift into physical reptilians and need to drink blood’. 4th density beings have no need of human blood/flesh BUT physical reptilians DO. I really don't understand why he doesn't make the connection. Dark astral beings feed off fear and other negative vibrations. They have no need of physical sustenance. There ARE lower astral reptilians but they work with 3rd density reptilians. Credo Mutwa talks about physical reptilians, not astrals. I don't know why David doesn't make the complete connection with all the stuff he publishes. These are 2 different types of reptilians. The astral ones are of minimal concern since if you aren't fear based, they have no power over you. The physical ones, however, are another story. David is where he is and DOES give out lots of good info, but he has his blocks. Two Reptilian Influences On Earth \"From the Library on 27: *Notice how females have been doing all kinds of artificial things around their eyes with make-up? Make-up, dyes, etc go back to the temple whores in ancient times. Temple whores were organized by those who had contact with the reptilians. Orion reptilians always wanted people to look to their eyes. They used hypnotic like stares to control. To draw one's gaze to the eyes, they used different types of enhancements to get attention. When watching TV, I notice how these bimbos today draw black circle outlines around their eyes, put all kinds of tacky colors around them and even glitter and such. This is pure reptilian female. *Female dominance in the Orion Empire constantly requires males to bow/kneel to females. One example of this is from the Dark and Middle Ages of kneeling to a female when asking for marriage. This is a reptilian tradition of subservience by the male. This began with royalty. European royalty is notoriously reptilian and half-bred. The common people, ever desiring to be like them, adopted this slowly. Lots of wanna-be royals out there. This continues today. When a female proposes, does she get on her knees? Of course not, it's not part of the Empire. This tradition is not practiced around the globe, but, of course, stems from Europe and from Europe into North America. These 2 examples are just 2 of the Orion traditions on Earth. 100"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Observation: Harry Potter/Chamber of Secrets The Harry Potter films are good entertainment and very well done. The Harry Potter films/books are geared primarily to children/early teens, but are read by all ages. Harry Potter material is LOADED with reptilian imagery. Harry Potter materials are meant to influence the reader/watcher to become more and more used to the reptilian ways. Harry Potter is filled with Orion imagery. I saw Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets this weekend. It’s a very well done movie. I was interestingly surprised to hear an Orion reptilian dialect used in the film. The words that Harry speaks to the snake and to open the chamber portals are spoken by real Orion reptilians. This dialect is used by Orion reptilian on Earth when talking to each other in the 'mother tongue'. If you were able to glean that from the film, you may have also intuited that this is a higher dialect used by the royals, hence its connection to control and to use power with these sounds. Harry used these words on the snake to control it, yet the other students thought he was urging the snake to strike. This is part of the mystery for non-reptilians hearing reptilian speech. Pay attention to it when you watch the film. It is really excellently done. Snake imagery, Slitherin House, \"Caput Draconis\" (Head of the Dragon) as the password to enter Gryffindor's house, alien spiders who eat humans and fear the reptilian basilisk, on and on go the Orion mystical examples. I'm surprised how brazen they’ve become on one hand, but on the other, they have plans that are close to being fulfilled. The phoenix, in this film, is representative of the Orion queen's ability to die and be reborn. This is cloning. For the queen, a tediously slowly progressing sequential, her spirit leaves the dead body and returns to inhabit a cloned version. This has been going on so long that only in the latest palace coup, where one of the royal females destroyed the queen and took her place, that the original queen has finally moved on to other things. Now there's another even more ruthless female in charge of the Orion Empire. The basilisk represents the rebel queen responsible for pulling our solar system, temporarily, out of the Orion sphere. The rebel queen (basilisk) is death to look on. The only thing that can blind the basilisk is the phoenix clawing out her eyes. The phoenix also brings Harry the sword needed to kill the basilisk. The phoenix is the Orion queen assisting in the downfall/death of the rebel queen. This film includes a message to those who support the wrong queen. It is fascinating. Harry Potter IS worth seeing. I will see it again but with an eye to decoding more of the reptilian imagery. Interesting what they're doing with movies these days. [Ed.- The author of Harry Potter recently said that when she read some of what she had written, “it scared her”. This indicates Harry Potter material is essentially channeled by Rowling from sequential sources deeply engrained in the Reptilian mindset -she would have never gone into fear if it was genuinely produced from her own imagination, per se.] M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge Internationa!

Human clones have been around for a while, but that's a whole other story. The Raelians claim to be wanting to develop clones to create \"eternal life\". For them, as for the sequential aliens, \"eternal life\" means physical immortality. The reptilians have been attempting this for millennia before Earther humans were created. They still have not found anything beyond cloning and drug extensions because there is nothing else to discover. The search for physical immortality is a search for what can never be. It is an internal search for something that already exists: the immortal you as your Higher Self. The Raelians founder claims to have been met by one of the standard Grey aliens. The aliens have nothing but their own interests in mind. They always have been that way. They have succeeded, via this stooge of theirs, with several thousand Earthers. It's the same old, but obviously successful story of getting the Earthers sidetracked again. This is also a Lightsider technique for deceiving Earthers to believe that the physical body is the object of fascination rather than the spirit. The Raelians believe that aliens cloned humans on Earth. Cloning was part of the alien genetic scientists' program, true, but it was not the core way Ancient Earthers became today's Earthers. The Raelian founder says the Grey alien he met was oozing with \"love\". Yeah, so oozing that he dazzled the guy with sequential alien beliefs of physical immortality. The quest for physical immortality is alien. Earthers who quest for that are body ID controlled. The constant running to allopathic doctors for the slightest discomfort to the physical body is a reflection of 'I am my body, the body is supreme'. This is an alien concept and one that is heavily propagandized on Earth, especially in North America. Drugs for everything you can imagine. \"They will extend your life\". They will not. The manner and time of your incarnation’s death was chosen by you and that cannot be changed. The media is dealing with the Raelian cloning with the poo-poo of the propaganda machine because Raelians mention the alien connection. Propaganda controllers would rather you don't look to the alien connection and how the aliens taught cloning/genetics to Earthers. However, in the meantime, these same Earthers proceed with their genetic/cloning methods. The Raelians are just another arm of the alien meddlers to sidetrack simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves. Observations: Aliens Who Cry Wolf There were 2 events tooted about by an alien group. One was the ‘arrival of the Nibiru mothership’ in Earth orbit \"on Sept 18,2001\". The other was on Sept 21, it was \"written in stone\" that ‘a meteor would hit either Italy or Morocco’. Obviously neither happened. 'Written in stone', please! Of course the Niburu are lurking out there, but what happened to the meteor. This alien group has predicted SO many things of which zero have happened. Then, they want to split hairs between 'probability' and 'prediction'. 'Written in stone' is 100%. What does that tell you? What I've been saying all along: that the aliens have their own agenda. They keep placing hoops out there to see which Earthers will jump through them. The lesson here is the aliens have cried wolf FAR too often to be given credibility MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

AND their agenda outweighs the illusion of assistance. NEVER believe the aliens unless they can prove what they say. They will continue to cry wolf - guaranteed. Observations: Aliens and ‘Spirituality’ There are different groups of people who are followers of alien ‘spirituality’. These people hang on every word that the aliens spout. These are religions just as any other Earther religion since they seek answers from external sources. While the information/observations I share are from MY Higher Self, you should be communicating with your Higher Self to see which, if any, of the topics I share are needed on YOUR path. One Lightsider site, which will remain nameless, is so enthralled with every word coming from this alien group that they need alien ‘blessings’ on what they want to pursue and believe. Of course, as with all religions, there is the priesthood. The priesthood of alien religions is the 'contactée'. This particular Lightsider group has their ‘holy father’ contactée w'ho remains in the distance, as do almost all 'holy fathers'. This calls for at least a ‘pope’ (moderator) who communicates the will of the aliens as given to the holy father who gives it to the ‘pope’ to dispense to the masses. Of course there are also lesser priests in this group, the die-hard defenders of the faith who will pounce on those who DARE to disagree with the ‘sacred’ aliens. The moderator will also call on followers to attempt to disrupt sites that don't follow the 'word' of their alien masters. The followers are upset that what I've written in M5 doesn't mesh with what the aliens say. No surprise there. \"What should we do?\", they cry. The moderator is quite uneducated as it is (another hallmark of alien manipulation choices). \"Matrix 5 is taking us to another way of thinking, popey dearest. Will the aliens SAVE us from Matrix 5?\". To this I'd say to that group, if Matrix 5 is SO upsetting and contrary to what you've been told to believe, you can choose NOT to read it and forget anything you've read. What's so hard about that? Well, it could just be that these people's Higher Selves are causing the unsettled feeling in their respective incarnations in order to get them to think for themselves. It would require a major change of mind for these incarnations and a new perspective. They FEAR this, so are looking for the moderator to calm them. So much fuss over a book that they never had to read or ‘were forced’ to read. Ah, well, it can be interesting to observe, at least for a while. These types tend to be so awed just with the idea of aliens and their advanced TECHNOLOGY that they don't hesitate to give their power away to them. It's one thing for the aliens to talk about alien, 3rd density matters, but another thing to talk about spirituality and saying their spirituality applies to Earthers who are undergoing a different experiential path. BUT then, that’s part of the Game. As always, with everything you hear (even from me), go WITHIN and see what YOUR Higher Self want/needs to hear. Beware of followers of alien beliefs. They're like the alien version of Jehovah’s Witlesses (intended spelling) who will try to keep you from the ONLY source of pure guidance FOR YOU, your Higher Self and you cannot connect to within as long as you are dazzled by without. MA T RI X V: The Gold Edition 103"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Alien Technology & the Game One alien worshipping, Lightsider site message talks about the technological advancements of the aliens with great awe. The message mentions, \"they are in advance of us ... at least the beings from Zenetae Andromeda have a lot going for them and yes, having been where we are themselves, they could tell you fairly accurately as to their advancement.\" This is exactly what the sequentially incarnating Higher Selves want us (simultaneous incarnates) to concentrate on - technological advancement rather than spiritual Advancement. External as opposed to internal progress. This is one reason why sequential incarnates take SO much longer to progress because they crave technological/external advancement. The aliens have been dazzling Earthers since Earther humans were both genders in one being. Yes, that's been part of the Game, BUT the goal for simultaneous incarnates is to move from the Game. That can be done only by closing down the attraction to alien/technological ‘rhinestone advancements’. The cheap dazzle is their lure to be 'like us'. Instead, simultaneous incarnates must learn not to be like them but true to their own Path, which, I've been telling you about in the M5 materials, is unique. One of the parts that the aliens play in the Game is to attempt to delay the simultaneous incarnates from discovering their true nature. Technology has been one of their prime methods of doing so AND it has worked well for them. Low incarnations ivorship alien technology, mid level incarnates crave alien technology, low through mid-Advanced levels put aliens on pedestals and tag them 'space brothers'. The veil of alien deceptions is torn in the Very Advanced stages and seen for what it is in your Awakened Final Incarnation. This stage, reached by your Awakened Final Incarnation, is a necessary part of the escape from the Game - when the alien glitter is discovered by you for what it is and, more importantly, what it isn't. A question I've brought up before of why aliens, when seeking contactees, always seem to choose the uneducated or someone who they scan as who will hold them in awe, is now answered. They would avoid anyone who is in a Very Advanced stage or higher (Dominant or Final Incarnates) because these levels have had the alien smoke screen dispersed (by Awakened Final Incarnation). Think of the aliens as the person behind the screen (as in the Wizard of Oz) using technology (big green head with fire and smoke to enhance the image) to dazzle Dorothy & friends. Once Dorothy saw the man behind the curtain (alien veil being removed), she saw the wizard (alien) for what he is and is not. The same happens to you. By your Awakened Final Incarnation, your veil will be taken away and you will see, in this example, the aliens/or what they really are. Since the aliens are not spiritually Advanced (in comparison to those beyond mid-Advanced levels), even though they would like us to think otherwise, they'd be quite insecure with the prospect of dealing with Very Advanced or, <gasp> and Awakened Final Incarnations. This is one of the reasons why they tippy-toe around, look for sycophantic/uneducated Earthers to carry their lofty sounding messages. A favorite alien pastime is skulking about the planet to avoid detection by the planet as a whole and look for other ways to derail Earther Higher Self incarnates. YET, alien groups have invaded other far less technologically advanced planets than Earth, BUT those planets are populated by other sequential incarnates! The 'you aren't developed enough' line is pure horseshit. They know it, but, like the man behind the curtain, they hope you don't.

Sequential Technology Dependence & Spiritual Laziness (Special Gold Edition Segment) I have been observing, for many years, how people become dependent on technology and how this dependence fosters increased laziness in most cases. When I was teaching astrology, for example, for several years in the 8o's, I never had one person in any of my classes who wanted to actually learn astrology. They were interested in how I could interpret their horoscopes or what program they could get to do the work for them. This was not because these people didn't have the ability to learn at least basic astrology, it was due to technological laziness. One of the major problems in the Game, with the introduction of technology, is the accompanying desire to have more external objects do your work for you. When it is for manual labor, this is understandable. This is also only the first step in the deception. The next step comes with mental laziness. Calculators have made many people lazy in using their mind to do even basic math. Most children now are so dependent on calculators that they are relatively incapable of doing simple math, without them. Computers take that a big step forward. Yes, you can play neat games on computers as well as perform numerous other time saving tasks. The question to ask yourself is how have these and other technological devices given you the excuse to stop developing mentally. It was a rarity, when I taught through the early 90's, to find people who would read! They couldn’t be bothered to read and had the lame excuses, \"I don't have the time\" or \"I just don't like to read\". This is pure laziness. They have given away their power to externals, in this case, technology. Many people don't want to read, but they will watch a video or listen to a tape (technology doing the work for them). This lazy attitude causes spiritual stagnation. This is one of the goals of the aliens in getting Earth to move from being a simultaneously incarnating planet to a sequential one. The SLOW progress of the highly technological aliens has become the goal of the rulers of Earth. This is a misguided attempt to push back EndGame. Sequential progression requires dependence on technology. I've tried to get people who took my classes to read. I gave them lists of books that would be a great assistance to their progression. These are books that would make them think and assist in discovering who they are. BUT \"I just don't have the time to read\" or \"I just don't like to read..does it come on video?\"! Incarnations, apart from minion, who are caught in this trap cannot Advance further than lower-Advanced. Mid-Advanced, Very Advanced and higher are driven to read and to know. This doesn't mean they don’t use computers, but they know that the main sources of knowledge come from reading. If you can't be bothered to read, you are not ready for the knowledge. Higher knowledge is meant for those who want to keep their power. The lack of interest in reading or the desire to read ’picture books' only makes these people dependent on those relative few who do read. Matrix 5 is written for a certain level of person and one who wants to read and this means read more than just Matrix 5. Yet, the large number of people who have been unable to grasp significant portions of the materials 105"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit-The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

They expect me to do the work and then be their steppin-fetch-it to do their bidding because they are either too lazy or too incompetent. I will NOT have dependents. There are plenty of teachers (low-Advanced through mid-Advanced) who want dependents. I suggest you find one much closer to your current level, in that case. People continue to come to me with questions that they can find the answers to IF they search. They are too lazy. There are those who have the ability to learn astrology, for example, but \"don't have the time\", \"don't like dealing with people\" or whatever, but it really comes down to not willing to take the time and effort required to learn. These people think that I should, therefore, ‘be their personal astrologer’ whenever they have the whim to know about themselves. \"Check on that for me\" or \"I read such and such somewhere, so interpret that for me\", is typical of what I get. I rarely use the phrase \"do for me\" to others because I've learned to do for myself. When they know you can do, they try to flock around you so you 'can do' for their lazy asses. On the other hand, you are not able, in one incarnation, to be able to do everything for yourself. This is where barter comes in handy and is a very valid form of transaction. If you want something, what do you offer in exchange? Idiotic Lightsiders believe that they have ‘the right to get whatever they want’ for no effort on their part beyond vocalizing the request/demand. This is a Lightsider feature and one they match with guilt to get you to obey. Fuck that! An example for myself: I am not a rune stone reader. I have no interest in rune stones. If I knew someone who could read them proficiently AND I wanted a reading, I would never go to them and request a reading without offering something in return. \"Could you do a rune reading for me? I would be glad to do something in return for you.\" THAT'S how you approach a barter transaction. If you want someone to go out of their way to do something for you and you don't offer to go out of your way in return, you are in a polarity mode. Lightside (it's your obligation) or Darkside (it's all about me). What also gets me is that when you point this out to the abuser/dependent-wanna-be, they immediately go into a defensive mode. The favorite '2 step' is \"that's not what I meant\". Look here, if it's 'not what you meant', then you’d better mature and learn to say what you fucking mean to say. I am not responsible for reading your mind and divining what the hell you mean. These people also don't accept responsibility for what THEY do. Notice: \"it's not what I meant\" means YOU don't understand. Fuck you...the responsibility is YOURS to convey what you mean. If the 2 step, guilt trip, oh-poor-me is your attitude, you will get fire back from me. Remember, over and over I say my materials are not for the spiritual kiddies. The root cause of this lazy attitude, that I write about in this segment, comes from technology. In the old, far gone days, bartering of services was expected and honorable. Today, it's a rarity. The computer does it for me, so should you...on demand is the prevailing attitude. Creeping Darkside - it's all about me. I have written that we live in the Dark sector of this galaxy, the Dark sequential aliens have been messing with us and the sequential aliens are well along to changing Earth into a sequential planet. I have NO time for the lazy, for those who don't like/want to read or to take the time to learn, for those who want me to ‘take them on’ as a dependent or for those who expect me to M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 106"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Sequential Influences, Individuality & The Game (Special Gold Edition Segment) \"You are part of a team \", \"you are a team member\", \"you must think of everyone else first\", \"the good of the whole is more important than the good of the individual\" - These are just SOME of the phrases that are drilled into you since birth. \"What will the neighbors think?\" is a concern of most people. This is group approval. Worrying about everyone else at your expense and subverting individual growth to cater to the group are SO common and SO expected. Something to remember about this constant whine of conformity is that it is based with sequential incarnates. This is the way of alien planets - progress as a unit and stifle individuality. This group mentality is a facet of the Game that adds to the challenge of the simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves. This doesn't mean that there is nothing to be gained from working with a group on occasion. The main experience gained from working with groups is to adapt ideas (that work for you) from the group and alter them to fit your style thus making it a totally new concept. For example, I have taken numerous teachings and techniques taught to me by shamans, wiccans, Monroe, etc and altered them to work in a new way that works extremely well for me. If one of my shaman teachers was to examine a shamanic technique that I've developed, they would see parts that resemble what they taught, but with new twists and turns that are, for me, MUCH more effective. Most of the teachers you have do not like you to cross their lines and alter what they believe is dogma. Yet, you must do exactly that if you want to progress as an individual. The way of higher than 4th densities is individual in scope. You will learn just how when you are ready. Now, on Earth, it is up to you to find out just how individual you can become. By breaking the molds, you expand. Each prime teacher I had was uncomfortable when I began to learn things that either they didn't teach or they didn't approve of. That didn't stop me. \"He's off on another tangent\", a couple of them said about me to other students who towed the line. Yep, and look where it's gotten me. If you are making others (peers, family, teachers) uncomfortable due to your desires to learn, that's just too damned bad! Go for it. The ‘group approval/disapproval action’ is one of the main control functions of the Game and the sequential aliens on Earth. These are in place to help keep you \"asleep\" and to try and keep you from Advancing and (gasp) connecting to your Higher Self. This mechanism is something that you must and will overcome. These are more 'rocks' in the rocky path of those on the quick route. My relatives cut me off mainly because I left the catholic church. My chief aunt demanded that I return to the church. 'You must stay in the religion that your family is\", she commanded back in 1987. A fork in the road for me although I didn't even hesitate to stick to my decisions. These relatives have not spoken to me since. Painful learning, but, when you chose the correct fork in the path, rewards follow. If someone asks me about family, I tell them that I have none. I don't. Remember family' is a body ID concept. Blood is thicker than water but to spirit is where you must go and this requires that you leave 'blood' behind! This does not mean that you dump your family.

If I had chosen poorly, these opportunities would not have been there. My Higher Self made sure that I had the conviction to stick with it, though, and choosing the correct fork was assured. When you are on a lower stage, you can and do make the ‘wrong’ BUT comfortable choice. You cave in to the groups demands, BUT you toyed with moving on and away from the group. That in itself is progress. The incarnations that fall back (l step forward/2 steps back) still did learn and that learning is registered. It makes it easier for your other more Advanced incarnations to proceed. Do what your current incarnation must do, whatever that may be, but also remember what I have said here. Sequential Shenanigans & Abductions (Special Gold Edition Segment) There are several alien groups who are attempting to duplicate simultaneously incarnating Higher Self experiences without taking the simultaneous path. These aliens abduct Earther humans (non-minions) in order to try to duplicate primarily, by technological means, the wide emotional ranges we have. Although they do realize that this is part of the simultaneous experience, they wrongly believe they can find a means to duplicate it with their advanced technology alone. They are so dependent on technology that they believe that technology solves all. This is the optimum external power giveaway. There is no future or spiritual development to be found in allowing technology to be a substitute for genuine spiritual growth. I remember when I was at the Monroe Institute hearing stories about aliens trying to use certain Monroe students to probe for clues to technological duplication of emotions. You would think that, after all the years of trying to do this, they would give up and know it is not possible from a technological perspective. Yes, you would think so if you are spiritually Advanced enough. They are not spiritually Advanced enough to recognize this. Therefore they continue to seek a technological solution to a spiritual problem. These aliens usually use fear projections to get their subject to submit to them. They have learned that Earthers in fear will usually do anything to end the fear. This is one reason why they usually avoid any Earther who is Very Advanced or higher. It is too easy to turn the tables on them. If the aliens get to being more invasive than the abductee's Higher Self will permit, the person's Higher Self will step in, in one way or another, to end the scenario. I have seen the aliens retreat in fear at the appearance of a Higher Self manifestation. Be aware, though, that alien abductions are also experiences and there are Higher Selves who will permit this for the experience, although watch is kept to make sure the aliens stay within the bounds chosen by that simultaneous Higher Self. If one dies due to alien abduction, it was because that person’s Higher Self chose that manner of death. Remember, nothing severe can happen to an incarnation if it is not in the experiential plan of the Higher Self. With alien abductions, the Sci-Fi channels 10 part series Taken and much more, the abduction scenario has gotten a new life after being on the back burner for about 10 years. This is partially due to the intended return of the Orion Empire and also due to EndGame. You have the power to drive the aliens away. You are your Higher Self. This is why the M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 108"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

However, this will not stop the Higher Self from interceding, if necessary. . The bottom line is, as always, to trust in your Higher Self. If you are an abductee, it is ONLY because your Higher Self permits it for the experiences. Nothing will happen to you, in the abduction scenario, that the Higher Self does not permit. Sequentially Incarnating Higher Selves (Special Gold Edition Segment) I have given you a fair amount regarding simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves and those of us who are on that fast track path. Those who have read and understood those segments now have a decent amount of information on that topic. It is time to give you some more information on the sequentially incarnating Higher Selves. Is there a difference? Yes, indeed. If you were to look at a sequentially incarnating Higher Self from the outside, you would see just a single energy thread emanating from that Higher Self. This represents the single incarnation that shim is experiencing. If you looked at a simultaneously incarnating Higher Self, you would see hundreds and hundreds of incarnational streams (the M5 cover is very good, but the incarnational streams cannot be properly demonstrated). The single stream carries all the memories of that Higher Self once shim entered the Game. It does not carry the memories of the Higher Self! This is part of the Game's restrictions, although in the sequential path, the memories are cumulative and allowable. As long as the sequential path is kept, the memories remain of all incarnations since the first incarnation of the Game. IF a sequential Higher Self becomes emboldened and decides to 'switch sides' and join the simultaneous path, the decision will cost all the active memories that incarnation had as a sequential path being. The memories are still there, but they remain within the Higher Self and inaccessible on shim’s new path. You do hear, on occasion, of aliens visiting an Earther contact and telling them that he was one of them. The contactee, of course, does not remember. This is a bit of sour grapes with the interfering Higher Selves to the new simultaneously incarnating one. A zap from one team to another to try and confuse/derail that Higher Selfs progress. The aliens pick an incarnation, almost entirely at this time period to shake up, due to EndGame. Inside a sequentially incarnating Higher Self, you would NOT find images of each incarnation that Higher Self has had in the Game. The images that I have reported inside a simultaneously incarnating Higher Self indicate active incarnations. They also indicate information entering that Higher Self at an enormous rate from each. This energy flow results in a brighter energy glow to these Higher Selves than the single strand of the sequential. The inner sequential Higher Self has smooth appearing walls.

Refer to the Gold Edition segments that explain sequential Higher Selves for more details. Each sequential has only one (1) 3rd density experience at a time, hence one (1) energy stream. Compare this to the cover art’s simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves. Note though that the cover art is not able to have hundreds and hundreds of incarnational streams.

This is behind the past/next life idea so popular on Earth. It is understood among the sequentials. It does not apply to simultaneous incarnates, as I have said in another segment. The Raelians have recently said that their goal is to make Earthers able to clone themselves and transfer the consciousness of one incarnation into another. That statement IS sequential alien. Be aware of this and know it is not an idle comment or an imagined one. The reptilians have mastered cloning so that certain royals are able to transfer from one body to a clone of the same with full memory. The Orion queen is the most notable adherent of that and does not allow just anyone to participate.The Raelian plan is a direct assault on the simultaneous incarnates and there is an alien group behind it. The reptilian royals are paranoid about being able to clone at royal levels. Most non-reptilian aliens don't concern themselves with this, but just incarnate in another about to be born body in the planetary race they have chosen. The Nexus of Time in a sequential Higher Self, like the single strand, only contains a single flow pair of energies. The orb on the Nexus is not multi-faceted, but smooth. The sequentials will eventually have to reach Final Incarnation status, but that is far in the future and we will be long gone when it arrives. The sequential incarnates are 3rd density junkies with an addiction only each individual Higher Self can break. As long as the focus is on the body and not the spirit and experiences, they are focusing on what will take them an awfully long time to work out. They will do it, but what a LONG time. Higher Selves on the simultaneous path do not associate with Higher Selves on the sequential path while participating in the Game. You should look at them as ‘teams’. When in the Game, the ‘teams’ are separate. The simultaneous ‘team’ is quite small when compared to the sequential. The only movement comes when one Higher Self decides to change to simultaneous. The Game will eventually end for the simultaneous Higher Selves as well. When the Game is completely done, there will be a lot of experience comparing. Aliens ON Earth & The Game I have written about aliens, to a certain degree, in many past segments of Matrix 5. I have also stated aliens are on Earth. What I will now discuss, a bit, is about aliens ON Earth and the Game. There are major Lightsider theories about Earth and the quarantine of Earth. One of them says that 'various fields supposedly surround Earth and keep aliens out'. This is a mix of truth and lie. There are different 4th density (astral) fields around Earth. They are the lowest of the astral and Robert Monroe talks about them in his trilogy. These fields do NOT and cannot keep aliens away from Earth. These are astral oriented fields and not protective force fields. Aliens have been coming and going from Earth since the planet was created. Aliens are here today. Earth was chosen by the Higher Selves incarnating in the 3rd density as the simultaneous incarnating playground.

Likewise any minions removed from Earth are still part of the Earth Planetary Spirit. The center of control for incarnations IS the Higher Self regardless of simultaneous or sequential incarnational paths. As I've also said previously, a Higher Self can choose to leave the sequential path and embark on the simultaneous. The reverse cannot happen. Evaluating the nature of the word, 'simultaneous' should make that clear. When an alien dies on Earth, that Higher Self is NOT forced into the Earther incarnational path. This is another Lightsider fable. This alien will return in another sequential physical according to shim's Higher Selfs Plan. This includes everyone from reptilian to pleiadian to tau ceti and everyone in between. This is part of the Game on a wider scale. When the aliens are finally revealed on Earth (one way or another), they will be incarnations of a sequential path Higher Self. Remember, the more technology, the less they rely on the spirit. Don't be taken in by their dazzling technology. They ARE coming in one way or another as the Orion Empire intends to have its way with Earth/Earthers. (Review earlier segments on aliens for more.) The best perspective one can keep in these very unusual times is to, above all else, remember who you REALLY are and act accordingly with regard to experiences YOUR Higher Self requires. The aliens play their polarity games and also try to keep you ignorant of who you really are. They WILL attempt to sweep you up into the Game at the cost of your Advancement. How you react to this will be in accordance with your Higher Selfs plans for that unique incarnation. The aliens are here already. They have always been here. They, in disguise, pass you on the street. They shape-shift into images that make you believe they are Earthers. They are in many positions of Earther authority. They FEAR being overtly discovered by the simultaneous incarnations. Those who use fear are wearing the cloaks of their own fears. They don't want the Game to end ... BUT it will, and the first to succeed and leave the Game will be those who have chosen - the simultaneous incarnational path Earther Higher Selves. Sequential Incarnates and the Merkaba (Special Gold Edition Segment) A very popular, Lightside technique in the world is forming a series of astral constructs or 'merkaba' around and within your physical body. There are heavy concentrations of this technique being called 'sacred', praying to the 'one god' and loads of references to 'unconditional love', the prime Lightside myth. If you were to read any of their web sites, you would a sugar shock from their descriptions and postings. Not only this but they'll give you the prayers to fit your religious background, so eager are they to get you to buy into this trap. Cutting through all the knee-bending shit, you will see artwork of the complex design they use. Notice in most of them you can find, in the center, the triangle up over the triangle down. This is the 6 pointed star usually referred to as the 'star of David' which has nothing to do with the fictional king of the bible, but was used by the Rothschild house of Europe.

All Rights Reserved. 112"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"David Icke has more information on that if you want it. However this 'star* is older than that by far. The triangle point up is the symbol for the Orion sciences divisions (genetics, etc) and the triangle point down is the symbol for the Orion military. Many of their ships have the 6 pointed star on them to indicate Orion Empire fleet. I have mentioned this in an earlier segment. These complex ‘merkaba patterns’ and creations form more filters on the astral to attempt to interfere with your Higher Selfs connection to the incarnation during EndGame. Fluffy descriptions of 'ascended masters' (THAT alone should set off warning bells within you) who descend (how nice of them!) to the 3rd density to help Earthers unite as a planet and progress as one is PURE sequential alien interference and, also, specifically part of the Game. It is another attempt to add more filters beyond the physical ones that their genetic science instilled in Earthers long ago. By strengthening these internal filters with astral filters, the incarnation will find itself stagnant in a Lightside loop. Giving away your power, once again, to external deities, angels and a 'hierarchy of superior beings' is a major new age religion demand of its followers. This is also part of their plan to make Earth a sequential planet and rid it of those bothersome simultaneous incarnates. I find it interesting that they seem to use gold light as well. This is an attempt to fool those who are moving into upper mid-Advanced levels. Remember I told you how the polarities will warp and mutate Balance to deceive. With the merkaba techniques, they get you to install your own blocks, which is far more sophisticated than the physical implants/controls forced on you. As I've also said before, the only astral enhancement that Monroe has in his Institute is a simple eggshell of energy. I say use gold light for that protection. If you place a complex series of patterns within this eggshell, it would be similar to stringing electrical wires around your home. My advice is to steer clear of this. Of course there are those incarnations (obviously) who have chosen to have the merkaba experience. I have given you the information that I've discovered about this topic. The decision is yours to accept or to decline the advice. Aliens & the Third Density Some researchers would have everyone believe “there are no aliens on 3rd density”. Monroe himself said he ‘never found any’ on 3rd density, but hoards of them on 4th (astral). THIS IS NOT TRUE. There are plenty of aliens in 3rd density and a good deal of them are interested in our planet! Consider this: Above 3rd density, there are no needs for materials, electronics, space ships, etc. Yet, the aliens who come to Earth have and must use all of these. They have physical ships, various advanced technologies and the need to eat. Once you are on 4th density and above, there is NO need for any of this. The desire to control Earther resources and population are all 3rd density matters. There is no need for Earth resources on higher densities as beings use their will to create whatever is needed. Since we have all these flying saucers and other alien craft, the occupants have a 3rd density origin, whether it be from our universe or a parallel one. Some of them do some lofty speaking to enhance their position and dazzle the contactees with their science. THEY ALL HAVE AN AGENDA. The Andromedans have said a lot through Alex Collier, but we have seen nothing. Last year they said there would be intervention on Earth AFTER a nuke was MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. 113"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"exploded. My comment is, if they are so 'good', why do they have to wait until a nuke is used? They have THEIR agenda. All this skulking about by both 'good' and 'bad' aliens tells us that none of them has the best interest of Earth in mind but rather they seek to use their own control methods and designs. If they were genuinely 'good', they would make themselves publicly known and reveal what is going on. They say they ‘cannot interfere on Earth’ BUT they do so every day in different ways. Instead of giving the Earthers the opportunity to make choices on their behalf, the 'good' ones continue to allow the 'bad' ones to exert their control on the planet. Change and progress come through radical experiences. If the 'good' ones showed themselves to the planet and exposed to all what is going on, power to decide would be given to the general population. Yet, they won't do that. Why? Remember too, both 'good' and 'bad' are relative terms. What's 'good' for one is 'bad' for the other. Polarity games continue with these alien participants. Keep in mind too that Earth is the ONLY location in the galaxy with simultaneous incarnations. ALL Higher Selves know this. What better place to play about when you are not participating in the simultaneous path! Aliens come up with holier-than-thou reasons for not going public on Earth, but you should be suspicious of them as well. It seems to be all about power and control by both sides. There is also a hefty dose of fear on both sides as well. The 'good' ones fear this and that, such as the bogus 'non-interference' policy. For having such a policy, they aliens surely do come and go and deal with different power/control groups on this planet. No, the only ones who aren't involved ARE the ones who should be - the people of Earth. Take a closer look at those on the sequential incarnational path (non-Earthers). See if you can glean why they are acting as they do with Earthers. I've talked a lot about taking back your power and control over self. Meanwhile, both alien polarity groups are ensuring that you don't have all your power when they are involved. They seek to keep your power and lord it over Earthers with their technology and skulking about. Remember in the series, Earth Final Conflict when the Talons killed the psychic woman because they feared she could see them as they really are? There is more to that. The key to advancement here is NOT technological, but rather spiritual advancement. The aliens offer religious control through their prophets. This is the opposite of spiritual. They have a fear of those spiritually advancing. Don't you wonder why they only seem to appear to the uneducated (Meier in Switzerland) or those who are wrapped in fear (Collier in Colorado)? These people can be controlled and used to further the alien agendas. They treat ALL Earthers like children, yet avoid those who are quite advanced spiritually. Why? Will the advanced ones ask the 'wrong' questions of them? Will these advanced ones be uncontrolable and not sufficiently dazzled by the technology? Will they be able to ask spiritually advanced questions that will reveal where these aliens stand? What do the aliens FEAR? Quite a bit has been released about Meier's Pleiadians and their home world lives on Erra. When asked about dancing, they replied that their females enjoy this, but the males don't dance because they have concerns over being thought of as gay! Yet these same Errans would have everyone believe how spiritually advanced they are and how Earthers are SO far beneath them. Agenda, agenda, but Meier the uneducated made a good slate for them to write on. These Errans avoid other Earthers like thieves hiding in shadows. They prefer to set up a prophet, as in old, mythological Earther days, and therefore a priesthood. See where this is going? Will they never give up trying to act like gods?

Why don't they show themselves to anyone who wishes to converse with them? Why don't they publicly land? What do THEY have to gain from manipulating Earthers? What promises do they make that they don't fulfill? Taking back your power also means not to give it away to aliens of any polarity. Lots to think about here. Astral Versions of Interplanetary Craft (Special Gold Edition Segment) In an earlier Matrix 5 segment, I mention that there is no need for space type craft on the astral. When we are on the astral, we are shed of a 3rd density body. We are in spirit form, although still an incarnational extension of our Higher Self. It is the physical body that would generally require a space ship to travel between star systems. The UFOish craft seen commonly roaming Earth's skies are physical craft either Earther created or alien system ships. On the astral,.you have the ability, based on your Advancement and self-imposed limitations, to create anything you want. Thus the astral is loaded with houses, temples, books, etc. This also includes the presence of flying saucers or other interplanetary style craft. It would be easy to create, for example, an Orion Death Star, but that's usually done by those carrying their polaric wars from the third to the fourth densities. In most cases, these craft are used, on the astral, to impress, to control or to intimidate others of less- than-Very Advanced levels. If one is impressed by these craft in the physical, they will still be impressed in the astral. Polarity conflicts continue on the 4th density and polarities will create whatever they find works for them. There are various New Age gurus who are pushing the awe of alien ships from \"other densities\". These people are usually willing or unknowing agents of the sequential aliens who push the alien propaganda line. This is yet another facet of the Game. This goes along with the fables of 'space brothers' and 'the aliens are here to help us'. This beLIEf system also goes to indoctrinate the unaware to serve the 3rd density myth of ‘sequential superiority’ by taking this lie into the astral and thus binding the incarnation (as long as possible) to cling to the words of these space phonies. It's ALL the Game! If you feel you must believe them and follow them, then that is what you need to do for that is where you are in your progression. If you've had enough of that horseshit, then it is time for you to move on to where your Higher Self leads you in your quest for truth. Those of Very Advanced stages and trained properly can handle astral craft that threaten with a mental 'snap of the fingers' to scatter the energy of their creation. Needless to say, when you have become that Advanced, the polarities learn to steer clear of you with their 3rd density style tricks. Gold light can do many amazing things to protect you and teach those that need a lesson something they should understand. I will not say more on that at this time. I have never heard of the ship creations hanging around the Monroe level 27 of the Library. This is probably because those who dabble in these types astral creations stay away from there as it is a gathering point for those who won't tolerate their drama. One other point on the space vessels: You will find craft from other dimensions poking around on 3rd density Earth. Don't confuse dimensions (parallel systems) with densities. The Game is SO complex that it would be staggering for someone not ready for it to try to comprehend. Our Higher Selves fully comprehend the Game and all its facets. This falls back to advice that I have been giving all along: Trust in YOUR Higher Self!

[See also Q&A #421 for related material] A Different Look At The Game We on Earth having simultaneous incarnations. Those Higher Selves, who refused the quick path, are having sequential incarnations. It seems part of the Game is for those in sequential incarnations to try and derail or, at least, place major obstacles in the paths of those choosing Earther incarnations. This would explain why Earth seems to be the central point of chaos in this sector of the Galaxy. Sequentials, in the guises of various alien races, meddling and causing other interferences to those in simultaneous Earther paths. This, of course, would make them ultimately responsible for the rocks in the rocky road and the source/cause of the experiential hodge-podge of Earth life. With other Higher Selves working against you, it makes the challenge that much more significant and valuable. This may well be the ultimate source of the conflicts centered on Earth.

A Different Look At The Orion Queen & Aliens The Orion queen FEARS death of the body. As such, she’s been cloned and preserved by life extending drugs. Without death, you cannot gain the varied experiences the Higher Self needs to progress. Each Higher Self MUST incarnate in 3rd density genders, sexual orientations and gain a WIDE gamut of diverse experiences. The Higher Self, who became the Orion queen, is experiencing a very limited amount of experiences, only one gender and a huge dose of absolute power. The Orion queen is, beyond a doubt, a low level incarnation. Remember, alien incarnations are sequential, so there is NO input from other incarnations into that particular Higher Self as there is in simultaneous, short lived Earther incarnations. If Ancient Earthers were not tampered with by the aliens, the ideal lives they were leading would have kept experiences to a minimum and those Higher Selves would have progressed as slowly as other sequential incarnations. Simultaneous incarnations did not begin until the aliens altered the Earther humans and created chaos on the planet. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, the phoenix-like Higher Selves who accepted the challenge of Earther incarnational paths are progressing as no others. The alien created chaos turned out to be the best matrix for the Higher Self to rapidly develop! Earthers seem to marvel at the huge incarnational periods aliens seem to go through. They'll tell their contactees of living for hundreds of years, or, as with reptilian royalty it can be tens of thousands of years or more! You should be able to see how slowly these Higher Selves, not participating in the Earther fast track, will progress. They live on homogenous planets in pretty uniform societies. There are few challenges, it seems, unless they clash with other aliens, like the Orion Empire. So, if things are pretty ho-hum, is it any surprise that they proceed at a snail's pace when compared to Earther incarnations? Earthers who long for life spans as long as the aliens are body-controlled, for it's the body that fears death, since the Higher Self is immortal. With the shorter lifetimes on Earth, we are able to gain FAR more varieties of experiences. Your Higher Self loves all these inputs from shim's incarnations as there is NO FEAR in those who chose the Earther challenge, 116"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"despite the individual incarnational fears of the various stages of growth, the Higher Self WILL overcome. Americans(especially) will be filled with the artificial life extensions of science/drugs and the false sense of lengthened lives through plastic surgery. Incarnational levels short of very Advanced will dabble with these to varying degrees. Once, in the very Advanced stage, the spirit has progressed beyond the need for attempts at extended physical life and shim realizes the time/manner of death was chosen by their Higher Selfs need of experiences and variety, there is a new flow of energy from the Higher Self into Dominant, Very Advanced and (primarily) Final Incarnations. Mature spirits/Higher Selves understand the folly of being body-centric and do get a kick out of observing those who are so wrapped up. Alex Collier told of that one OLD Andromedan who died after living SO long but would be born again into another Andromedan body, you should be able to see how slow that Higher Selfs experiences are moving. Same race, same system, similar experiences even if shim should choose a female body for shim's next 3rd density move. This being will still have all the memories of shim's past incarnation - SLOW progress. Meanwhile on Earth, you are experiencing ALL races on the planet, both genders, all sexual orientations, both polarities and a HUGE range of emotions not found elsewhere. ALL this is being processed by your Higher Self. See what joy that Higher Self is receiving because there was NO FEAR of taking up the memory-denying challenge of the Game on Earth? The unparalleled emotional range of Earthers is so fascinating to other races that some are trying to duplicate the emotions WITH TECHNOLOGY in order to forego the Earther commitment. I was told this by an alien group loitering around the Monroe Institute when I was there. This will NOT work and is doomed to failure. When I told them they must incarnate here to gain these experiences, they rejected the idea outright. Take heart! Examine all facets of your life and spirit. Look within, not without, for it is within that you will find your peace! Drugs & The Game (Special Gold Edition Segment) Americans LOVE their prescription, over-the-counter and 'illegal' drugs. America is a nation of drug addiction. The constant blare on television for prescription drug use (complete w'ith the whispered, rapidly spoken side effects of their useage) has Americans in line at their AMA doctors to get the latest drug fad. Take your pill to sleep, to rid yourself of stomach acids, to lower cholesterol, to do this and to do that. The people I work with each take more than one prescribed medication every day. The women are most notorious for this and one has her bottles lined up on her desk like they were trophies of distinction. This is also semi-skillfully used with guilt by her to control how she believes others (with few r er drugs) should treat her. The men in my office are also on their medications. One hunky, mid-40's guy tells me how he's on cholesterol and blood pressure pills. They are obviously taking a toll on him. Meanwhile, the most I ever do is herbals or homeopathic, but no alopathics more severe than plain aspirin. This doesn't even get into the 'illegal' drug useage. These heavy drugs are easily obtained in most of the. US.

It’s the vast useage of all these and legal drugs that I want to draw your attention to. Now to the question of why the Earth is a planet of drugs with the US as the headquarters. Drugs, all prescription/over-the-counter/’illegal', have a roof purpose of trying to cut your spirit/Higher Self off from the body. Drug useages add chemical blocks that your Higher Self has to overcome in that incarnation. Drug useage dulls your psychic receptors and weakens your will to counter the alien DNA commands. This is even found in brushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste. Bend to the alien powers. The haze of drug useage is a major attempt by the sequential incarnates to delay your Advancement and extend the length of the Game on 3rd density Earth. It won't work but it doesn’t keep them from trying! Our Higher Selves are well aware of these attempts by the sequentially incarnating Higher Selves in the Game. They know this is an EndGame feature. Simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves have planned for this event, just as,when you are playing a board game, you know what lies ahead for your piece. Nevertheless, the sequentials will continue to try and stop our progress and our escape from the Game. Drug useage IS an experience, however, and there are many incarnations that want to have these experiences. These incarnations are not in the Very Advanced stages when they do this, although they may overcome them and move into Very Advanced during the same incarnation. This is done so that you have a current reference to the problem in that incarnation. You overcome the sequentially inspired problem and that makes them huff and puff. Knowing that the drugs you see advertised in all the media are sequential dead ends will assist you in defeating these road blocks or rocks on the rocky path. Knowing that there are aliens taking much pleasure out of seeing the United States of Druggies should assist you in overcoming the body ID that demands the drugs. The television ads with happy people dancing to take their drugs. Free flu shots to everyone in my area and so on. The body is working against the spirit, not with the spirit. The body, as we have it since the Ancient Earthers, is a sequential alien creation. Guess who that creation is designed to serve?! Spiritual Advancement and eventual ruling of 85% or so of the body is a major victory in the Game. The odds are against you. The odds had not taken in the full abilities of the Higher Selves on the simultaneous path. The body fears death. The drug companies play to this fear. The body panics and drags the weaker spirit to the drug store to get these 'preserving' drugs. This is like the Orion reptilians who have drugs to extend their lives. 'Be like us' is the lure of the sequentials and their heavy body orientation. Drugs will help you feel good, extend your life...trust us. Don’t believe it. This segment gives you a vastly different perspective on drugs and should assist you in making decisions for yourself (being spirit) over your body.

TV shows and films have been made on this topic and are usually quite entertaining. This topic came up yesterday to me from two individuals, so I will give you some information. Time travel is a complex subject as it involves not only moving through time, but also the intricacies of the Game. The Game is a huge jigsaw puzzle. It is a common misconception to believe that if you have a few pieces of the puzzle that you have the entire picture. Time travel involves just a few pieces of the puzzle. In the Back To The Future trilogy of movies, Doc Brown creates a device that can physically move people through time and undo events that they are uncomfortable with and thereby create a reality that favors their positions. While very interesting to watch, it just isn't possible to do these things. Time travel is a reality. In Matrix 5, I mention how I learned basic astral travel and, in that course, astral time travel is discussed and assignments are given to travel back to 1600 and forward to 2200. Refer back to other segments for the details as well as which book/teachers I had. Astral time travel is the fastest way to zip around through time periods. You leave your body, use the techniques given (although I altered them to fit what works best for me) and you just appear where you warit to be. You can observe things going on but cannot change what you see. Remember, time is an illusion. Earther Higher Selves are simultaneous incarnates and you exist in all frequencies chosen by your Higher Self for the experiences shim warits. Our 'present' is another frequency's 'past' or 'future'. Some say that the future isn't here yet, but that isn’t quite correct. It's a matter of perspective. The Higher Self is a being of exceptional power and ability. However much of this ability is held in check, by your Higher Self, when your Higher Self agrees to participate in the Game. This refers to both simultaneous and sequential incarnating beings. The Games rules do not include changing the rules by using your abilities. The restrictions of the Game take precedence in the 3rd density. In certain instances the Higher Self can intervene (as per earlier M5 segments) to ensure that the incarnation's pre-choscn path goals are met and not circumvented by other Game players. Time travel, whereby one or a group decides to ‘mold events to fit their agendas’ is a violation of Game rules. Such an action would interfere with experiential choices and is motivated by the body rather than by the spirit. In Back To The Future, Marty McFly wanted his family's experiences to be different than what they chose. By going into the past, he altered events to make his family's path totally different. You can't do that. This would have interfered with the experiential choices of several Higher Selves to fall under the desires of one. This is a Lightsider power play, the 'I know what's best for you' ploy. Moving away from fictional films, there's the Montauk series of events and their time travels. The Montauk project was built with heavy alien activity and instruction. If you don't recall what I've written on alien, sequential incarnate attempts to hinder simultaneous incarnates as part of the Game, refer back to earlier M5 segments. Beware of aliens bearing gifts! They most likely have an a hidden agenda. That certain aliens wanted the Dark government of the US to have this technology should say something in and of itself. It wasn't made available to everyone or even the knowledge of it made public. Nope, MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. 119"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"the aliens, as usual, go slinking/slithering around in the Dark to attempt to manipulate/obstruct the developments of Earther Higher Self incarnates with the assistance of Darksiders on Earth. The Montauk project is wrapped in tragedies, murders and more. That alone tags it as a Dark event. Mind controls, interdimensional tamperings and others have invited trouble to Earth. The 20 year loop event caused by the Montauk experiment - the rift - is real and a bi­ product of the experiment. Have you heard of the aliens who were responsible for this technology returning to repair the damage their interference caused? Of course not. Therefore one has to question their intent. The rift would not exist if the damage was repaired. On the other hand, the rift couldn't exist if it was not part of the Game. Again, beware of aliens bearing gifts. There is an excellent source of Montauk materials in books by Preston Nichols and Peter Moon available through Sky Books on Long Island, NY. Start with The Montauk Project - Experiments in Time if you’re interested in this topic. I've read the whole series and find it quite interesting. A huge amount of deception and paranoia is depicted by the controllers of the technology. Paranoia and deception are common among Dark workers who fear losing their control. That should indicate how tenuous their hold is. One thing to remember in reading time travel stories is that you cannot go back in time to kill anyone to change history. If this were possible, history would constantly be changing for all the time travelers wandering around being like Marty McFly. For everyone who wants future CC, there's another who doesn't want that but rather future MM and then someone else who wants future WW and on it goes. Time travel can be excellent for OBSERVING first hand how something was. The body oriented would say, 'why don't you see what next week's lottery numbers are so you could be rich?'. Geez, I've been asked that question enough. Your Higher Self is in control of at what stage you are able to start conscious astral travel. If you can't do it yet, take it up with your Higher Self. If you can, your Higher Self requires that talent for that incarnation. Astral travel requires a certain stage of spiritual maturity. Astral time travel requires even more. August 12, 2003 is the next 20 year date for the time loop created by the disastrous Montauk project. The loop event was created on Aug 12,1943 when things just seemed to go wrong. Again I point out the alien connection and set-up for this to happen. You also didn't see any so-called 'good aliens' with their advanced technologies step in to ‘undo the damage’. Once more, beware of aliens bearing gifts. This energy rift seems to peak every 20 years from the 43 date. As it is, I've written that 2003 looks like it'll be the year from hell. Add this event to the pot! There is one thing I would like you all to remember though - this IS part of the Game. Something of this magnitude would not be allowed IN the Game if it were not part OF it. You need more pieces of the puzzle to see it better. I find it interesting that in the latest claims by the Andromedans they use the date Aug 12, 03 as the deadline they set for ‘driving all aliens off Earth’. There's a connection here. I advise you take whatever the Andromedans or their lackeys say with no more than just a grain of salt. Remember the ‘mass fly over of Andromedan ships’ that was going to happen a couple of summers ago? It seems that ALL aliens just get their jollies from seeing what Earthers will believe next. They ALL have their agendas.

They want you to generate fear, feel threatened and give your power away to Dark authorities for external 'protection'. There is nothing to be 'in fear' about when you KNOW and TRUST in your Higher Self. That is the KEY for each Earther Higher Self. With the gold shield and trust in your Higher Self, you know you're immortal and it's the body that tries to get you to fear. Who created the bodies we have? Those damned, fucking aliens! It can seem that the aliens have their claws, paws and hands all over in the Game. Yes, these are other pieces of the puzzle. They fear you discovering who you really are. The Montauk project is just another of their tools for that. The puzzle, however, will not be completed for you until your Final Incarnation merges all of your Higher Selfs incarnations into one. Time travel is fun and exciting to watch on TV or in the theater. Time travel can be quite interesting in the astral. Just remember with each phase of your awakening that you will be met head-on with external blocks and fears to keep you from progressing. This is the Rocky Road as per that segment in M5.

The result is the minions and the low and mid level incarnates panic seen on tv and in print today. 'We need our external deity', they scream. 'We aren't responsible enough to live life without an external deity', and they fall on their knees. 'We want to give away our power and if we can't have our god thrust on the lives of everyone irregardless of what they feel, we want a new, violent revolution'. Ah, yeah, horse shit everywhere. The judges didn't say that these people could not use the power giveaway phrase, 'under god' in private. The two judges said it was a violation of separation of church and state. Wails and moans of the religiously rabid aside, when you observe a situation like this, always look deeper. The Orion Empire is returning. Self-proclaimed Earth Emperor George the traitor (but is he a real traitor if he's a reptilian? Hmmm) says how important \"the almighty\" is to him. The \"almighty\"? Yes, the Orion queen is referred to as 'the almighty' as one of her numerous titles. I've already said several times that the 'god' of the Earther religions is the Orion queen. The US ditty of 'one nation under god' does not have the surface interpretation adhered to by the masses of followers, it's the Orion queen to those in power who know. Since one of the Game's Wild Cards is the overt control of Earth by the Orion Empire, the US is most definitely under 'god' also known as the Orion Queen. Removing her from the pledge, money, etc at this date is not allowed and the fools who follow play right into her hands, rather claws. Just think, if this Game Wild Card is permitted full play, these nuts can have their 'god' on the faces of all planetary monies. Some may ask about removing prayer from schools and some other events of past decades. Did they remove it from Congressional sessions? NO! Did they remove it from oaths taken by leaders and judges? NO! They also didn't remove it from several other areas. The reason prayer was removed in schools was to create division and enhance the 'divided they fall' MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

These are the things that Very Advanced and higher incarnates should look at, not just the surface and the 3-ring clown acts in Washington and by the damned one-godder fanatics. The Game will not allow dismantling of the slightest piece of it UNLESS it serves the Game by introducing a more advantageous (to the Game) piece. Yes, it's all experience indeed. Keep your eyes/ears open. Patriotism and The Game Ever since 9/11, the Game has been successful in getting draconian measures passed in the US because they wrap these measures in a flag. One of the holy words of the current phase is 'terrorism'. This is one of fear's catch phrase terms. Most people are anxious to give away their power for the illusion of safety. The people they want you to fear and point their fingers at for 9/11 are NOT those who were responsible. If you want to see who is responsible for 9/11, look at the finger pointers. People are dancing to the tunes that the fear mongers in America are playing. Those who do so are being controlled by their bodies. It's the body that fears death, never the spirit. The Game has moved into a higher gear since last September. They want you to believe there are 'terrorists' everywhere to keep people in a fear state and, thus, feed the lower astrals who enjoy the negative vibrations. They want you to give away your power so they can make you obey them. If you don't give away your power, then you don't invite the vampire into your home. If you DO give away your power, the vampire is invited in and you only have yourself to blame. ’Patriotism’ is another catch-phrase term they use to control the people. This, as are all Game terminologies, is warped as well. It's another way to force conforming. Conforming is ‘necessary for the Game to succeed’ with its goals. Both Dark and Light polarities are involved in this phase of the Game - which should tell the observer something. Here's an excellent quote from Theodore Roosevelt on Patriotism that is currently appearing on Davidlcke.com: ARE YOU LISTENING GEÒRGIE? \"Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the president or any other public official, save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiently or otherwise he fails I his duty to stand by the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the president or anyone else.\" Theodore Roosevelt This is excellent, and should be remembered by the Observer. What is going on in the US today also happened in Russia during the 20's, Germany in the 30's and Eastern Europe/China in the 50's. Emperor Bush, while goose stepping in DC, wants 1 in 24 Americans to spy on their fellow citizens. This was a feature of fascist, communist and any other totalitarian governments.

The papers say Bush's approval rating is 72%. This is not true but how they are manipulating, as always. So, what does one do? Low and Mid level incarnates will dance to the Game's tune as these are the experiences their Higher Selves want. Low Advanced through Mid Advanced levels will give lip service to the dance but have reservations about it. They may share these reservations with close friends, but will wave their flags in public or challenge the Game directly (David Icke for example). Very Advanced and higher won't be found waving flags for the Game's benefit. Observation is key here. Watch and analyze. Take many mental notes, but resist getting caught up in the Game's fervor. Leave that to those at the levels where this participation is necessary to learn. You will do what your Higher Self requires of shim's incarnation as you. There is no good/bad here. It's all experience. This is their experience and they must be free to pursue it. They release excellent information on the Game, but from an attack point of view rather than the observational point of view. They also are Lightsiders trying to 'save' everyone from the Dark. This is ok. It's their path. Keep the Laws of the Universe in mind when faced with the fast track the Game has started. With the stock market also crashing (intended despite what Greenspan says in public), more fear is generated. Fear is the name of the current Game chapter. The alien Wild Card is moving into play behind the scenes. Which Wild Card is about to be thrown into the action? My advice to those in Very Advanced stages is to beware of being swept up in the drama and observe, but above all else, do what YOU feel you must do. Observations: The Game is NOT the film \"Matrix\" I rejected the submission of a link to a page that glorifies the film 'The Matrix' as if it is The Game discussed in Matrix 5. This site takes many of the film's ideas and compounds them. I went there, and it's full of movie based theories and human superior bullshit. It's an interesting film and there are some similarities to The Game, but giving the film THAT much energy will lead to dead ends and other similar manipulations. The reason that people are pulled to the film is that there is a subconscious nudge that Earther existence is not what it seems to be and controls are involved. Most of what is in The Matrix is pure Hollywood, which is controlled by the Dark polarity. The polarities love using material that contains only enough truth to catch the unsuspecting. They candy coat (truth) their dead-end lies so that the lies will overwhelm the truth. I NEVER use the term 'matrix' as that has a connection to the film. 'The Game' is far more accurate as it IS looked on as a Game by those Higher Selves involved in it, both Earther experience and alien (non-Earther born) experience. The film is way too Dark and sinister which does serve the polarities. Matrix 5 explains the Game for what it is - experience and a learning ground for higher experiences. The film is heavily Dark & Light polarity with Neo being the man who will 'save' (external deity) the people, not just help them realize who they are (thus 'saving' themselves), but who actually does physical battle against the Dark. That is NOT the way to win the Game, but rather the way to continue in it\\ Of course it's YOUR choice with what you want to do with your incarnation. Choose whatever path YOU want. Your Higher Self will be YOUR guide. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

The nurse told her they are too busy with hordes of sick & dying to see her, but the doctor would call in a prescription WITHOUT EVEN SEEING HER TO DIAGNOSE. When this woman went to the pharmacy, the pill pusher told her that they are SO backlogged with drugs to dispense that it would be over an hour before they could get to hers. She started whining (female hallmark) and she got her drugs sooner. There are high numbers of sick/dying around here and I'm sure elsewhere as well. Coughing, hacking, fevers, flu, etc. Excessive self-prescribing/over the counter drugs as well as prescriptions galore. They constantly attack their immune systems with chemicals then wonder why it doesn't function properly. Homeopathy is the only way since it works with your immune system rather than against the system as allopaths do. Homeopathy also goes to the root/cause of the disease and not to the symptoms which are just fruits of the cause. Of course this immune attacking via drugs is part of The Game and the destruction of the immune system is part of it. If your Higher Self is participating in this through shim's incarnation, it's all for experiences. If you aren't meant to have these horrible experiences, you'd be dealing with a homeopath. This is just one facet of The Game's current time line. One's Higher Self can desire the experiences of certain diseases. As I've said in M5, if you are supposed to experience an event related to illness or death, no doctor, healer, homeopath or shaman will be able to cure you of it. Observations: Why \"Star Trek\" Scenario Will Not Happen Here on Earth It was 10 years ago that Bob Monroe told my group at his Institute that he loves watching Star Trek. He also said it will never happen. At the time I didn't understand why not, although I had a sneaking suspicion that what he said was true. Since having all the experiences you've read in Matrix 5 and what I've shared here, I now know why Monroe was absolutely correct. In the Second Edition, I explained why Earth has been quarantined by the aliens and how this is due to their desire to keep Earther Higher Selves from 'infecting' non-Earth systems. They don't fear germs or such, they fear the Advancing Higher Selves may interest their systems in the rapid development path. It's NOT that we are so 'primitive' by their standards in technology. It's that we are advancing farther/faster than they are in spiritual development. Even in the new Enterprise series, Earthers want to change the status quo of aliens with the 'be like us' and 'we know what's best' attitudes. These are common in those in the mid through mid-Advanced spiritual levels. These incarnations have advanced only enough, at this time, to let their physical and/or their limited spiritual states dictate. Once you get into the Very Advanced stages and, of course, your Awakened Final Incarnation, you move beyond the need to impose your will on alien cultures or individuals.

Different groups (again) at war to impose their beliefs/restrictions on others with no regard to the Universal Laws, Yes, these are learning experiences for the developing spirits, AND if this was the limit of it, Earth would not be quarantined since the Sirian/Orion Empires are just 2 examples of alien groups that also impose on others. The alien fear is those Earthers who have moved BEYOND this level and operate on other levels as well. These have some astounding abilities and perspectives that THEY fear and don't want their populations to be exposed to. Knowing this, do you think that some alien group will bring 'rescue' ships to remove the population, as some would have you to believe? Hell, no! Maybe cattle car ships for them to dine on, yes, but not to 'rescue'. Be VERY suspicious if this Wild Card gets played. Remember Twilight Zone's 'To Serve Man' episode from the 50's. The aliens would NEVER allow Starship Enterprises full of Earthers to zip around the galaxy. Earthers must be contained. On the other hand, the 2012 date looms ever closer. Even without a quarantine, this date warns that Star Trek treks are limited to imagination and film. There is ONE exception, and that is people who can astral travel. They can go anywhere and anytime. Yes, it is MOST interesting. Few can do this, but more can do this today than 100 years ago. This ALSO puts fear in alien leaders since they cannot stop this. These same beings (including the secret government) have developed astral alarms & traps to catch those who try to probe their facilities. I wrote about this in M5 as well, so please refer to what's in the text. These astral alarms are primarily located on Earth, so if you can astral travel, but VERY careful where you poke around. They can follow you back to your body via the 'silver cord' or connection to your Higher Self. Then, too, if your Higher Self allows this to happen, it's an experience with a questionable ending, I'd think. You can briefly visit Mintaka, which looks a lot like Coruscant (Emperor's planet in Star Wars) or Erra in Taygeta in one of the Pleiadian systems (very green) or even one other world which is rocky and the local have homes build in the sides of cliffs with the outer wall looking like glass. These are friendly. THIS type of travel, which will eventually be available to ALL, is one the aliens cannot stop. They try with fluorides, vaccines, nutra- sweet, pollutants, electronic zaps and more (see Matrix 3 Volume 2 on this stuff), but yet the Higher Self will counter these effects in those incarnations shim wants to experience astral events or other special situations. So, enjoy Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, etc. You WILL be able to glean some hidden information in them, depending on your level of advancement in the current incarnation reading this. But never forget it's THEM (aliens) who have fears about US (Higher Self Earthers). This should give you things to think about.

Look at some of the events since the mid-1800's and where they have been moving Earth since the mid-1800's until today. The United States is the central thrust of the Game due to the nature of it and the power that it commands. * Lincoln shreds the Constitution and the concept of independence for the American states in favor of a single nation (damn the constitution) at the command of a central government. *Females raise the stakes on their control over males with prohibition as their first crusade in the US. This is followed by voting rights with the sham front of \"equality\". The Orion sleeper DNA has been activated. * After several wars, old empires crumble, especially in Europe. The attitude of the Game is 'you have to break a few eggs to make a cake 1 . World War I and World War II are the most significant, especially with the formation of the United Nations. *In the late 1980's and early 90's, the communist block crumbles from within and by the leaders, NOT the people, in most cases, especially Russia. This is very significant. The Game moves into a higher gear. The European Union develops and grows into a United States of Europe. It has expansion plans today. Single European currency becomes a reality. ^Immigrants flow into Europe and the US. These are immigrants who mostly serve to further dilute the native populations. Homogeny is encouraged. *One world thought heavily promoted, one world people and the people are forced to conform to new sets of 'rules'. Unified measuring systems, unified currencies and no borders are all key phrases. The new majority (women and non-Europeans) discriminate against European descended males. Men willingly give up control in most cases due to their Orion DNA commands.Women (Orion mode) are at the front. ^Problem, reaction, solution becomes almost a daily event with fear, death and fear of death (for the body ID'd) introducing police state trappings: video cameras everywhere, police monitoring, you can't say 'this' or 'that'...fear, fear, fear. The Mid Advanced and higher incarnates will have no trouble in adding to these observations. What you need to be aware of is that all of this IS the Game in action. Not only that, but these events are being coordinated by sequential aliens. It was the sequential aliens who introduced advanced technologies on Earther people who were not spiritually mature enough to handle them. It is the sequential alien incarnates who are looking to tip the Game in their favor. And their 'bottom line'? The whole thrust of ALL this meddling, ‘One World’ stuff is to convert Earth into a sequential incarnate type world where there are minimal differences and a lack of true experiences that simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves live for. The sequential incarnates seek to deny the simultaneous incarnates a place for rapid development and, hence drive them from the Game by denying us what we thrive on. THAT is the Ultimate Goal! 126"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"While this is their goal, they will find they are fighting an impossible battle to win. Keep the year 2012 in mind as the final year in EndGame. I expect most of us, if not all of us, will have departed before then. The sequential incarnates are way too late to reverse or halt progression. In this time period, simultaneous incarnates are ALL over Earther history and time. It is OUR EndGame and time for us to move on. They can't deny us what we already have, but they do seek to take Earth as one of their own and deny any other fast paced block of incarnates. Another thing the simultaneous incarnations are not paying attention to is the Earth planetary spirit. The planetary spirit is also preparing to Advance to shim's next level. The greed of the sequential will prove very fruitless. If you can astral time travel to the year 2200, you will be able to see what I mean. What you will see in 2200 is the result of something that will happen in these days of EndGame. One thing that I've discovered about all the sequential incarnates' worlds is that they are SO alike on their own planet. It would be terribly BORING for a simultaneous to find much of interest on these world besides knowing who they are. These worlds are homogenous, have a one-world government (even in the Empires of Orion and Sirius). It is the sequential incarnates who demand little, if any, change and little, if any, independent thought. It's the 'good of the planet' at the cost of the 'independence of the individual' which is their mantra. John Kennedy's inauguration catch-phrase in 1961 was a key to this intent AND was of sequential thought. \"Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country\" THIS IS A SEQUENTIAL, ONE WORLD PROGRAM MANTRA. Lightsiders embrace it since the nature of Lightsiders is to give all. Darksiders embrace it as the nature of Darksiders is to take all.... the yin-yang of balance (not to be confused with true Balance). The country is here to serve the people if the simultaneous incarnates are in charge. When it becomes the other way around, you have a sequential incarnate world with a heavy minion population. This is Earth today. Consider all of this when you make your observations. Remember the Bottom Line!

It is not that Earth is not capable of sustaining a huge population. It's what is incarnating in this excessive amount of human bodies. The Higher Self has specific goals/experiences desired on 3rd density Earth. There are many Higher Selves, each with many hundreds of incarnations in all time periods. The ideal amount of incarnations was in Ancient Earth where there were several hundred thousand incarnations at one time. Today there are billions. When Earth humans create physical bodies, they must be animated. When all spirits coming from Higher Selves are incarnated, but bodies are still being produced, the animating spirit must come from the animal group souls. Creation demands that this be so and this is what the Orion/Sirian Empire is counting on. Humans animated by group soul energy are of the lowest order, very animalistic in human form. To those who are very perceptive, they are noticed by the flat, depthless eyes (windows to the soul), for example. These incarnations, being animal in nature, will follow those who take care of them (government or religion) and always look for others to take care of them. These incarnations are easily roused and stimulated. These easily participate in mob actions, violence and rapes. They move with the winds, but will resist change to their minimal comforts. In Robert Monroe's books (1st and 2nd), he meets disincarnate animal/human spirits , for example, in the ‘ball of carnal desires’. Robert pulled one from the naked ball and he described the blank expression and the desire the spirit had to get back into the sex ball. Read his books for details. This is one place recently dead minion (animal-into-human- body) spirits go... the lower astral. It is the 'glow' of the human experience that still holds them. In time, it will fade and the spirit will wink out and return to the animal group soul. This spirit CANNOT make the transition to Higher Self spirit form as it is contrary to its nature and purpose. It should be left alone to develop according to its own desires. That religion (which wants people to breed like roaches) wants more children (the visible force behind the anti-abortion movement) shows it wants the population to continue to grow. Why? The number of incarnations of minion spirits already exceeds incarnations of Higher Selves. Remember, the Empire wants breeding, production and food, NOT advancing spiritual growth. Higher Selves, knowing the body is a vehicle for experience, nothing more and nothing sacred, understands the Dark plot. The 'body is sacred and life is sacred' mantras originate from the Empire where it IS sacred to them. Minion spirits are strictly to animate the excessive bodies. Minion spirits are more closely related to nature spirits than to Higher Self incarnations. They have a different function in their own evolution. Dark didn't hesitate to mutate the Earth human into genders, why 128"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"should they care if they mutate animal spirits into these bodies as long as it serves their purposes? The Empire understands this and is using the anti-abortion/religious groups to further its goals and try to counter the Higher Selves. We have been told that if the majority of Earthers requests benefic alien assistance, they will come. Well, i/the majority of Earthers are of minion spirit incarnations, that majority can never be reached. The Dark is playing/mutating the Game to fit those rules. This will be found to be of little consequence, however, for change and evolutionary progress will happen despite the Empire and the Dark. It is not the purpose of Advanced, Dominant and Final Incarnations to overly concern themselves with Minion Incarnations. This is being revealed to add more to your understanding and assist you, especially if you are a Final Incarnation. The Matrix and Minions One statement made in the film Matrix is to remember that those still asleep will do anything to preserve the system and defend it, therefore consider them enemy pawns. The same applies to real life. Unless a person is awake, they will defend the system and must be considered enemies. This means use extreme caution in how much you tell a sleeper and steer clear of the minions who cannot awaken due to the nature of their animating spirit. It's interesting, as I told Val, that the minions also have their own song on the radio now. The chorus goes, \"We ain't nothing but mammals, so let's do it like they do it on the Discovery channel\". Minions will defend whoever makes them comfortable, feeds and houses them. The welfare system is in place, among other things, to make sure the minions know who is feeding and 'caring'for them. The preservation of the system, where only the rulers decide any alterations of the direction of the planet, is paramount to the establishment. This is where The Handbook comes into valuable guidance for those very few awake and those trying to awaken and break free. Due to this, it is imperative that those who want to be awake regain all their power, because if the Handbook changes are thwarted, at least you will have the ability to spiral beyond this tragedy. Light and Dark (in Light clothing) have really stepped up the assault against private gun ownership. This is because Dark knows what is about to happen and wants to up its control. Even if everyone around you wishes to remain asleep, look to yourself. If you don't take care of self first, you won't be able to assist others properly. More on Minion Incarnations There is a finite amount of Higher Selves who choose to incarnate on Earth/3rd Density. One is never forced to begin a series of incarnations here, however one can accept the challenge. Many never will choose this route. The Earth spirit desires those in harmony with its own nature which is why the pre-gendered Earth humans had a paradise where telepathy with animals and true peace was the way of things. [Ed. - See also Q&A #13) Earth is reacting to the uncomfortable and mutated population on the planet by trying to get rid of those who don't belong. Famines and natural disasters are two ways.

The Earth spirit is a Balance entity. It has been feeling the imbalance for quite a while now and is reacting accordingly. Time magazine (11/25/02), in their People section, show women from the PETA organization storming the stage of a Victoria's Secret fashion show and carrying posters calling the model \"scum\" because she's working for a fur company. In an earlier Matrix 5 segment, I mentioned the radical PETA organization as being minion and Lightsider composed. Another minion incarnational fondness comes in the seemingly endless attempts at comparing Earther human activity to the animal world. It's been on the news and in print how human sexuality, for example, is constantly compared to animal realm sexuality. This is an invalid comparison. The Nature path is vastly different from the Higher Self path. How many times have you heard comparisons of human gay orientation and talk about how animals aren't gay. Of course, this, for one, is not true. Most animals are bisexual. However animals are not on the same experiential path as we are. Comparisons of both paths should be ignored as invalid, but will give you a clue as to where the person/people who push these things are coming from. This is more of sequential alien incarnates attempting to derail the simultaneously incarnating. It is the minion incarnates who, like the meddling sequentials tampering with us on Earth, are constantly trying to compare human life to animal. Not only that, they will go so far as to say animals are superior to humans. This is one of PETA's mantras. This is another dead end to try to block simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves. That most of PETA's members are female also tells you something. Since the majority of Earth's population is female and the majority of incarnations are minion due to alien interference, well, you can connect the dots on that. The PETA Lightsiders, usually Low Advanced levels, are involved for experiences that their Higher Selves desire. These people will eventually move beyond this stage, if not during their current incarnation then in another. Observation: Minion Moves I was watching Survivor last night and, after one guy gave a Lightsider speech about not telling lies to women <sigh>, he extended his right arm, palm down in a loose fist. One other guy comes up, extends his right arm the same way, and taps the other guy's extended hand. This is the same action that chimps and other jungle/forest apes use. I've seen it before on nature shows. After this, I watched another show where this guy starts a one handed, chest thumping when he's trying to prove a point about himself to a panel. This is another ape communication tactic. You will see this one armed, chest thump particularly among blacks and hispanics. If you've been particularly observant, you'll notice that these animal antics began some years ago among black race elements and were eagerly copied by hispanic and certain whites. This is minion activity. Remember the nature of a minion spirit in a human body; Unlike the simultaneous Higher Self, the minion spirit is nature based and retains that image even in the human body. I remember one guy wanting me to respond in this type of manner and I replied that I don't participate in those minion activities. He had a shocked look on his face when I said that.

This reminded me of when my shaman teacher wanted me to go to a 'shaman in a weekend’ style course to see how NOT to learn. At one point, the instructor wanted everyone to \"act like an animal of their choice\". I just couldn't do that. It felt so wrong for me. Yet those there started growling, snarling, etc. Talk about a minion group event! Quickie shamanic courses are very popular with lower Advanced and some minions due to their stress on connecting with the animal realm. True shamans do not carry on as Quickie, faux 'shamans' do. Simultaneous Higher Selves are not on the nature spirit path. When you see people mimicking ape interactions, think minion. Most of Earth is populated by minions, so that's not hard to catch for observations. Minions are group soul beings and when one or more of them start acting in a certain manner, others follow to belong to the herd or pack. I noticed that not all of the men in that Survivor tribe did the ape touch. Only a minion spirit won’t hesitate to respond to another minion spirit. There are all kinds of minion moves to see every day either in person or on television. Minion incarnations are just SO perverse, but this is a part of the sequential aliens manipulations to try and halt the progress of the simultaneous incarnates. Minion Incarnations and Embedded Memories New York City announces it has 70 million rats in the city. The TV news next shows PETA protesting New York’s attempts to kill off as much of the rat population as possible. 'Rats Have Rights' reads the posters as a rat-costumed person tries to be cute. As stated in the previous section on minion incarnations, they originate from the animal group soul and not the Higher Self souls. The breeding of human bodies Oike roaches) has forced animal spirit essences into these bodies. What memories are embedded on this animating spirit? Animal, of course. This includes omnivores, carnivores and herbivores. Herbivores detest meat eating and hence organizations like PETA exist. This does not mean PETA membership is totally herbivore incarnates, but it does mean primarily. Various radical Light-siders have also been pulled in. Animal abuse should not be tolerated, but this should not be taken to the extreme where animals abuse people either, example: rats. PETA is just one example of animal groups soul incarnates' organization. Carnivore incarnates are drawn to the military and the police as careers for 'legal' brutality and to criminal organizations for illegal and semi-legal expressions of their natures. Both the military and the police have lowered their admission standards to draw in these incarnates. The recent news has US military in foreign lands raping in Okinawa as well as other inexcusable activities both in Okinawa and other parts where the military is stationed. Police beatings in places like New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and elsewhere are perfect for carnivore incarnations. Why are these types of incarnates encouraged to join the police and the military? Will the military and much of the police turn on the citizenry if ordered? If they are minion incarnates, most definitely. Consider these questions well based on the information given in this section.

The thing about the decal is that it has 5 toes and not 4 as the animal has. I commented to him that they don't have 5 toes, but he didn't seem to care. Today, when leaving a mall, I noticed another vehicle had the same decal in its rear window - the 5 toed paw print. This is nothing less than one of the marks of a minion - animal in human form, no matter what they might beLIEve it is. This cutsie animal/human combination antic has been around for a long time, but is more prevailing in these latter decades. Animals acting as humans and humans acting as animals. Minion incarnations! There are more minions on Earth today than at any other time in history both pre and post Atlantis. Look for the 5-toed paw print when you are out and about. I'm sure more of them will turn up. Just something else to observe in the cornucopia of EndGame. Stirring Up The Minions Once you begin to seriously spiral out and want to withdraw from the Game, those around you will fall into action against you. Whether it be family, friends or co-workers, they will use whatever means they can to get you to drop those non-conformist thoughts and return to sleep. The forms of attack range from demands to silent treatments to guilt to body loyalties and everything in-between. The Dark and the Light will use surrogates (weak, body controlled people) to irritate and attempt to intimidate you. I've heard of a teen child hitting and giving grief to her mother, who just happens to be spiraling out, co-workers isolating a person who won't be part of the group and does what he does because he happens to be spiraling out, and a married man whose wife makes unreasonable demands because he wants to spiral out. Religion is a common weapon for those you know to use against you. Your aura changes once you seriously start to close down your participation in the Game. If your spirit is mature/advanced enough, shim will resist these coercions. The more you resist, the stronger you will get. You can find yourself quite alone unless you can hook up with another rapidly advancing incarnate. This is good as you can support each other. Let the dogs howl. It's a major test for you. You MUST pass these types of tests to show you have the conviction and maturity needed for the higher dimensions. No one said it'd be easy. Minions & Aliens & The Game - Oh My! A take on a Wizard ofOz phrase (Lions & Tigers & Bears, Oh My!): Minions & Aliens & The Game - Oh My! While you can find Earther Higher Selves in just about any location and group on Earth, there are some places where minions and aliens prefer to go. Minions are found in all sporting events but, unless working as janitorial staff, you would never find a minion at a Star Trek or other sci-fi convention. Minions are body oriented. They make excellent blind followers, hence security staff, military and similar.

All Rights Reserved. won't find lower level Earther Higher Selves there too, but minions thrive on this stuff, while Earther Higher Selves will evolve out of them. Aliens can be found all over the place from positions of planetary, religious and corporate powers to someone living in the neighborhood. If you've seen the film, Galaxy Quest, you saw how the aliens are able to shape-shift into human form. While this is a film, the techniques are genuine. This is how Cathy O'Brien in Trance Formation of America saw George Bush Sr. change from human form to reptilian. While Earthers can find this technology amazing, certain alien groups have had the ability to shape shift for a long time. They use it here either to pass unnoticed or to deceive. Not many Earthers would elect an obvious reptilian to the presidency, after all, and the Americans, as a group, prefer their illusions to reality. Yes, aliens WOULD attend a sci-fi convention to observe what Earthers are doing with these topics, BUT you would not likely know they are aliens unless you had certain abilities. Of course aliens will always deny who they are. They are not going to say, \"ok, you caught me\". They are fulfilling functions on Earth and it is vital to their function that you don't know, just as it is a major function of the American government to keep the citizenry in the dark unless it suits their purpose. If the Orion Wild Card gets fully in play, THEN we'll all see aliens as they really are for the need for deception will be ended. The only reasons after that will be to discover people who work against their system. It is not that an incarnation, either simultaneous or sequential, is on Earth that makes Earth special. It is the individual's Higher Self choice of one growth path or the other. This is why I had said in earlier material that the so-called quarantine of Earth is NOT to keep us apart for US being primitive, but to keep the masses of sequential incarnates from being 'contaminated' by the simultaneous incarnates. The reasons for all of these shenanigans are due to Earther Higher Selves, the simultaneous path and the Game. In this regard, Earth IS at the attention center of the galaxy because only on Earth can you choose the simultaneous path. The Game is SO interested in maintaining your interest in the game board, the pieces and the rules that it doesn't want you to look away from them. The Matrix 5 material is taking you beyond the Game as well as giving you much hidden information on the Game. I will also tell you this has certain factions quite frustrated because of the Matrix 5 materials. Their frustrations come from my using a formerly hidden function of the Game itself (the escape hatch) while telling you the Game must go on to its end. More on Nature Spirit Incarnations \"The current news is featuring this 'new' information on ‘the intelligence of dogs’. They say that dog barks and sounds are language. No kidding. All animals have some sort of language and communications. The Higher Self of the nature realm is the Planetary Higher Self This being, as stated in previous Matrix 5 materials, is wrongly referred to as 'mother Earth'. Refer to past segments on this topic. The Earth Planetary Spirit has a full range of incarnations just as our Higher Selves do. The Planetary Higher Self is as intelligent as our Higher Selves are, but the path of experiences is vastly different from ours. This does NOT mean that there is no intelligence in the Planetary incarnations. There are low, mid and Advanced incarnations for that being as well. A low level nature spirit incarnation can compare to a low level Earther Higher Self incarnation. They are parallel but like comparing pineapples to bananas - way different.

All Rights Reserved. low level human (non-minion) incarnation comes across as a dim bulb in the intelligence department, for example. The animal 'group soul' is a processing segment of the Planetary Higher Self and under that being's control. The nature spirit realm includes mineral, plant, insect and animal. It also includes elemental - salamander (fire), undine (water), sylph (air) and fairy/gnome (earth). Advanced incarnations include diva of various levels. These are a study unto their own and, if you are interested, there are books out there that can give you clues. The concern for us is our path and our Higher Selves. Way on down the line we will be able to merge with Planetary Higher Self knowledge in higher densities. I have spoken briefly with the Planetary Higher Self (on 2 separate visits) who recognizes me for who I am. Interesting being. Shim is accessible, to a certain degree, to those who can discover the location. The Planetary Higher Self prefers to concentrate on shim's incarnations and path. Curiosity visits are discouraged. There is distress over the abomination of minion incarnations and the ravages of Earth by irresponsible incarnates and aliens, but despite this, the Planetary spirit is also dealing with these as experiences and processing information. Remember that Monroe stated the Earth will regain the pristine condition, devoid of any cities/pollution/etc, in the future. Refer to the Journeys Out of Body trilogy. When a species becomes extinct, it just means the knowledge gained through that species is now complete. This is a good sign. The wailing over extinct species comes from Lightsiders who value the body more than the spirit. They don't understand the nature of the Planetary Spirit path and think they are assisting when they are actually interfering. These people, in error, believe they are the ‘superior development’. They are not. Being different does not make one path superior or inferior to the other. The hand-wringing over beached whales/dolphins is pure Lightsider control crap overly concerned with the physical and doing what THEY think is ‘best’ without the concern of why the Planetary Spirit is doing this. Suicide in the nature realm is just as valid an experience as it is in humans. I've seen sea gulls wait on the side of a busy road then throw themselves in front of a car to die. Being different does not make one path superior to another. Lightsiders transfer their values/desires to nature path incarnates which have a totally different set of values/desires. It IS a mess but Lightsiders will get over it as they progress. Respect of nature spirit incarnations is one thing, but allowing them to invade/control your life is another. I went to one house where the person living there had spiders all over. He didn't want to \"disturb\" them and where they decided to set up house. The balanced approach is to require respect for your home and escort any spiders trying to set up shop outside. I tell them unless they’re paying rent, out you go. I do know several people who feel SO subservient to the nature spirit realm that won't even kill a mosquito. That's Lightsiders and certain minion incarnations. For Lightsiders, it's a phase they will evolve beyond in some incarnation. I don’t intend to be writing further on the Nature Spirit realm. To know some about it is one thing, at this stage of progression, but to concentrate too much on it will detract from your own path and development. The Library on level 27 contains a lot of information on the Nature Spirit realm for those who would like to know more, but this segment should give you more information that you can use when considering interactions with the nature spirit incarnations.\" M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 134"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Humans and Eating Earth humans are designed to be omnivores with cutting teeth, 4 small fangs and molars. Therefore, humans are meant to eat both plants and animals. Herbivore incarnates are repulsed by eating meat, thus we have PETA, hinduism (that's why they believe they can die and be reborn as an animal because that's where they belong!), and vegetarians. These organizations and religions also pull in well meaning and radical Light siders, however, the hard core is herbivore incarnates. Plants are aware and DO feel pain. Their spirits are of the elemental experience, which is significantly different than those of Higher Selves. We are not to be concerned with their path. WAY down the progression line, you will understand all they do. Plants respond to positive and negative vibrations. The elemental kingdom understands its purpose and has no problem with it as long as it only properly incarnates into plant and animal physical bodies. Their perspective is lost when forced into incarnating in human bodies. The Higher Self incarnates must, and do, learn respect for these kingdoms and to work with them.

Earth Planetary Spirit - More Information People hear about the 'goddess' Pele in Hawaii or the ’god’ deva of the Matterhorn in Switzerland. Are they real beings? Yes, but they are not deities. Placing deity lables on beings show a lack of spiritual Advancement. These are devas and NOT deities. These are examples of incarnations of the Earth Planetary Spirit. Visions people have of Pele or other major devas are glimpses of the Planetary Spirit's higher incarnations. Some of the places where these beings are found are major volcanos, mountain ranges (Alps, Himalayas, Rocky Mts, Mt Ranier, etc), vortex points and similar energy wells. I will not go into why they are here nor their purposes. If you are to know more, you will be led to where you can receive this information. The Nature Spirit path is significantly different than the simultaneous Higher Selves path. The experiences are totally different and it is not, at this time, necessary for extensive details to be known. As I've said in earlier materials on Nature Spirits, we will all know about their journey much farther up the Advancement line. Earth Planetary Spirit incarnations include the 4 elementary spirits: gnomes(earth), salamanders(fire), slyphs(air) and undines(water) and all their various sub-spirits. There are many levels to these incarnations and deva is quite high (Advanced) within the Nature Spirit progression. Their purposes all vary. The perversion of minion incarnation, though, is not part of the Planetary Spirit path as it crosses the two, widely different paths. This is a polarity perversion and breeding, in these days, assists the perversion. I have discussed that earlier. Taiwan had a 7.1 earthquake today. This is a direct action by the Earth Planetary Spirit as are volcanic eruptions and other planetary events. The Planetary Spirit has ultimate control over shim's physical body (Earth) and it is foolish of aliens and Earthers who think they can totally control the direction of the Planetary Spirit's path. 135"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"More Information on the Nature Spirit Realm In Matrix V, I mention the Nature Spirits and minion incarnations. I have also discussed some of the Planetary Spirit beings. Their Path is significantly different than those of Higher Self incarnates. The Nature Spirit Group soul is connected to that planet's Planetary Spirit. You can correctly look at Earth's Planetary Spirit as the nature version of our Higher Self. The Planetary Spirit is responsible for all nature realm incarnations. All non-dead planetary bodies in the universe have a Planetary Spirit. A dead planetary body corresponds to a dead human body - the Planetary Spirit has departed. From this you should be able to deduce some significant aspects of the Nature Spirit Path (depending on where you are in your progression). I will give you one more level on the Nature Spirit Path. It is directly connected to that system's sun/star. The sun/star of that solar system is the next node for the Planetary Spirit. When, eventually an entire solar system 'dies' (all dead planets), the Planetary Spirits will unite in that system's sun/star. When that sun/star goes dead, that Nature Spirit version of the Higher Self moves on to the next step in shim's progression. Don't bother to ask, since you will know all the what/when/whys when you are ready. Each living planet in a sun/star system is considered an 'incarnation' of that sun/star. All animal/vegetation is considered incarnations of the Planetary Spirit. Note, though, that this path and development are VASTLY different than all Higher Self incarnations (both simultaneous and sequential). Our concern should be on our own Higher Self and shim's development while in the Earther segment of our Path. WAY higher up you will be able to see the need and purpose of the Nature Spirit progression. The higher material is SO fascinating BUT you must be ready for it. To be ready for higher materials, you must spiral beyond the Game. Final Incarnations will resonate to this information far more than any other. Revelation: \"Loosh\" Yesterday, after reading something, on the internet, claiming to be an explanation of Robert Monroe's 'loosh' (reference Far Journeys by that author), I was struck by the absolute untruth of what that person had written. He said loosh is created by human beings. That couldn't be further from the truth and it shows he did not comprehend Monroe's books. Robert said beings were harvesting 'loosh' from a pristine Earth. At the time he discovered this, Earth was free of all human life except 2 bodies that spent most of the time in stasis. The writer of that 'humans create 'loosh' is stuck in body centric beliefs and has set up dead ends for Advanced levels to get caught in. I mentioned that to Val on the phone last night and said it was time that I gave some information on the nature of Monroe's term, 'loosh'. This essence is an energy vibration (NOT 'love'). It is created by the Planetary Spirit of a pristine, pure vibration, such as the future Earth (minus humans, aliens, minions, etc). This is part of the Nature Spirit realm and progression. It is not something that we in the Higher Self progression should be overly concerned with AT THIS TIME. The Planetary Spirit is a parallel being to our Higher Self but on a vastly different experience. The Planetary Spirit REQUIRES a pristine state to produce 'loosh'. I will use Monroe's term because there is no other English word I can think of to describe it.

This pristine Earth is populated with plants, certain insects, animals, birds and fish of all sorts which are the NATURAL bodies for the Nature Spirit group soul. Earth WAS pristine at one time. This was before Earth was violated by the Orion/Sirian Empires. Earth did generate loosh back then. Once the aliens arrived and began ravishing the planet, the production was rapidly disrupted. Enter The Game. The Game is now reaching its climax which will involve the removal of Earther humans, aliens & minion people. Earth will undergo a regenerating experience after that. The Planetary Spirit will then be able to restore Earth to the pristine state that allows the Planetary Spirit to restore production of loosh and to Advance even further in shim's progression. The plant, mineral & animal life of a planet are expressions/incarnations of the planetary spirit. The Earth planetary spirit also agreed to participate in The Game but from a totally different point. It is not necessary for me to write further about this now, so don't ask. Monroe wrote about the harvesting of the vibration known as loosh. He did not reveal why/how it is used and it is not necessary for Earther Higher Selves to know AT THIS TIME, as I said earlier. You will know when it is necessary for you to know. As it is, this whole topic is quite advanced and I can’t fully say why it is necessary for me to reveal this information, but it was given to me to do so yesterday. On a personal level, I'm glad to release it because Monroe's loosh has generated lots of speculation and curiousity.

Most of their bodies looked similar to the modern male body with an important exception - the genital area. From the outside, it looked like the. modern female. However it contained both the female and the male organs recessed within. This allowed them to reproduce with whomever they chose IF they wanted to reproduce. They were also able to enjoy the pleasures of sex without concern of pregnancy whenever they wished. They had the ability to shield the growth matrix female egg from the living male sperm. Of course each Ancient earth human produced both sperm and matrix. The 'Garden of Eden' setting of simple life on Earth, where they could also communicate with the animals telepathically, came to an end with the discovery of this planet by the Orion Empire. The Empire, ruled by a reptilian queen, in its ever expansive mode, found mineral and water rich Earth and immediately claimed it as part of their Empire. The Empire is conquering-based and considers non-reptilian races as lesser and males as subservient. The reptilians are the oldest 3rd density race and extremely advanced technologically. It also requires enslaved populations, of its conquered worlds, to work under their direction. The Empire also needs a steady supply of food. Seeing Earth was ripe for harvesting its mineral growth, they knew the need for a large and growing slave population was first. They found the Ancient humans totally unsatisfactory. They were as children - naive, innocent and friendly. However, the Earthers were dazzled by the flashy technology of these strange aliens. The alien genetic scientists, joined by those of their ally, the Sirian Empire, were told to mutate the Earthers into a suitable slave race. First they realized the natives had too much harmony and control as they were. The scientists decided to split the Earthers into male and female genders. They created 2 different types of chambers. One would deprive the Earther of its male genitalia and related mechanisms. The other removed its female genitalia and mechanisms. Dazzled by the technology, the humans eagerly went to the chambers, choosing one or the other. When the newly genderized humans first saw each other, they were repulsed by each other. The males did not like the female breasts, while the females did not like the external sexual organs. They refused to associate with each other (see also the Law of Attraction in a section below). They remained male with male and female with female. While the conflict was considered good for the Empire, they had to find a way to force them to breed. After much tampering with DNA commands and many failed experiments, the scientists were able to suppress the repulsion and heighten the command to breed. The Empire also tried many and varied forms with the Earthers, in their genetic experiments, including using alien genes and various ape genes. This is where the various Earther races develop. It is not the history of the mutated Earth humans or the Empires of Orion and Sirius that I want to draw attention to, but rather the child innocence of these spiritually immature beings. They did not have the DNA and gender problems caused by the Empire as we do. 138"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Their bodies were in harmony with their spirits and the planet. Their existence did not allow for maturity. Here comes the Empire. What started as a Dark venture wound up providing the grounds for spirits to mature and learn far more rapidly than the many placid planets in existence. There has been a resurgence to become as a 'child'. This resurgence originates from the Light side with dark's approval. This must be avoided for it is the child innocence that caused the problem in the first place. This is not the same as the joy a maturing spirit experiences (see also the Humor and a Light Heart sections). It is known that the empire is not pleased with Earthers and is seriously considering harvesting the humans and sending a few to the genetic labs to create a new Earth human obedient to the Empire. Consider how much easier for the Orion Empire it would be if we ‘became as children’, once again dazzled by super advanced alien technology. The 'gods' of old intend to return. The alien deity says in the bible to be as little children or you cannot enter into the kingdom. The Koran stresses submission to 'god' (that's what Islam means). The New Age religion encourages people to be childlike. Think on that in relation to this section and discover who is really behind it and their goals. 12-Strand DNA There is a belief in many Light-polarity circles, that the original 12 strand DNA that Ancient Earth humans had “can be restored” in the current human bodies. This is not true. When Earth humans were a single being with both genders in one, there were 12 strands of DNA. When the alien genetic scientists split these humans into 2 genders, they also ravaged 10 strands of DNA. The so-called 'junk' DNA humans carry today is the remnant of those 10 strands. In order to restore the 12 strands, humans would have to reverse the process and re-combine the genders. This will not happen. You can't go backwards for all the chanting in the world with this matter. With the Dark plot to control Earth, the Orion Empire actually created the current Game that entities with a Higher Self saw as an opportunity for rapid spiritual advancement. The challenges to remember who you REALLY are and to grow spiritually are powerful. Many entities choose NOT to take the Earth incarnational path because of the challenges. As Robert Monroe said, those who have accepted the challenges will advance far faster and further than those who don't, but the choice is theirs. It takes many hundreds of incarnations to remember and to reach the Final Incarnation. Progress depends on the individual Higher Selfs incarnations and how rapidly they discover and see the Game for what it is. You will receive NO help from the masses. Actually, you will be held back by the masses. Conform, do what we want you to do, submit are all part of the command structure to fail. Due to the Orion Empire's female dominance, they are using the female gender on Earth to set the stage for their return. If we were part of the Sirian Empire, it would be the males being used for the return. You can see why there are many who do not want to take the challenge as well as why so many refuse to accept these Advanced Studies. They just aren't ready for it yet. This is ok as we all must go through these stages.

This is the First Law of the Universe and not of ‘everything except 3rd density’. A few body-centric people believe this Law does not apply to 3rd density. The alien genetic scientists went to great lengths to try and circumvent the First Law with DNA tampering and commands. The Empire's scientists sought to ‘do away’ with this law by forcing the Dark will of ‘opposites attract’ because this would create conflict of the spirit and serve their divisive purpose. Divide and conquer. Millennia have been used to try and force it. People who are their body instead of their spirit have much maturing to do and obstacles of the Game to overcome. Once your spirit is mature enough, shim will recognize the Laws of the Universe for what they are and will want to live them AND overrule the body's programming. This, of course, sets off built-in alarm bells in those who are in denial and wish to play the Game. They will try to pull you back into the Game by any method they can come up with. It is a test of your spirit to resist those who would drag you back. If you wish to spiral out of the Game, you must abandon the rules of the Game. In much of the western world, females are the instruments of the Game because the Orion Empire (female ruled) is planning to return and, under the guise of 'equality', females are seeking overt control and dominance. There is the bogus wail of stopping violence against women, for example. Notice it is not stopping violence against PEOPLE. This is why we are constantly bombarded by overt female violence of hitting, slapping, kicking, punching, etc and continual anti-male verbal slams. TV and film is full of female violence. Yet, if a male says anything anti-female, they descend on you like a flock of harpies. \"Don't do what we do; do what we say\". This is Orion DNA commands in females. The companion DNA command in men is to obey the female and be subservient to her. Of course this isn't true in all cases, but it is in the vast majority. If you wish violence to cease, you must stop participating in it. There is much deception in the false 'equality' message. Males and females are NOT equal, but their treatment should be equal, something that females resist. The evening news reported that female executives in the advertising industry are paid more than their male counterparts. Yet, you hear no 'equal pay for equal work' comments from the females on this matter. No, and you won't. You have to train yourself to see, not what they want you to see, but to observe what is really going on in stealth mode. The Body vs. The Spirit Which rules your incarnation, the body or the spirit ? In MOST of your incarnations, the BODY will rule the spirit. This is because the immature spirit is learning through the bodies' experiences. As experiences increase, the spirit learns. By mid-level incarnations, the spirit is confident enough to start to exert itself over the spirit to a limited extent. It isn't until advanced incarnations where the spirit begins to control 50% or more of the body. At the Final Incarnation, the spirit controls 90-95% of the physical. DEATH - Death is a big issue to the body for it ends the body's existence FOREVER. The lie of resurrection of the body is a physical fantasy of religions who are body-oriented. It doesn't matter that the life force spirit lives eternally or that the experiences of the body live forever with that incarnated spirit. The body knows it is mortal and will die.

Cemeteries are the physicals' monuments to other physical vehicles. They are a waste of money. The spirit has moved on. Only the decaying shell remains. Nevertheless, when the body controls the spirit, they continually hang in cemeteries and talk to the dead body. Once the spirit has sufficiently advanced, shim knows going to cemeteries is a waste of time. If one wants to say something to a spirit, you just say it. Another thing about death...why is it that when someone dies, they’d have you believe the best person who ever lived just died? This guy was an asshole in life, that woman was a super bitch, but they die and suddenly they were living saints! This is the body again. Instead of remembering BOTH 'good and bad' experiences, they choose to only remember a limited amount of the experiences. It is far more realistic to remember the incarnation for how it was. Then there's the word 'death' itself. How that word is feared! They have to look for other words like 'passed over'. Yes, the spirit passed over, but these people don't understand the spirit. If they know shim 'passed over', and UNDERSTOOD it, they wouldn't be weeping and wailing and dressed in black. He (the incarnation) DIED. SHIM (the spirit) can't die. Funerals are for the body and for those bodies still living, not for the spirit nor those advanced enough to comprehend the matters of death. CONFORMITY - Conformity is totally of the body. Concern over what others think of you, desire to appear dressed based on what others expect of you are just 2 examples. In pre- Victorian society, people were far freer in matters of sexuality and appearances. It was the Victorian era, however, that kicked off the previously latent Orion DNA commands. The Victorian era brought about the male prison known as the suit and the female prison known as the corset. Everyone dressed in black by the later 1800’s, Appropriate color, for the end of individuality was the goal. Cracks developed in the late 1960's with the hippies and continued through the 70's. However freedom was threatening to undo the DNA commands. The repressive 8o's and increasingly freedom-robbing 90's have force people to conform to Orion commands on an ever increasing scale. Females exerting dominance and running under a double standard of 'do what I say not what I do' is part of the Orion schedule. If a male doesn't conform to this, they are viciously attacked by the reptilian female commands. American 'beauty pageants' are constantly berated by females as demeaning and making a sex object of the female. Yet, the recently broadcast male 'beauty pageant' on FOX had the males parade in bathing suits, judge by all females (female pageants are judged by mixed group of judges), had the males strip their shirts off while the women howled like animals in the audience. Yet, FEW people can see the Orion connection. Conform ... conform ... you can't say this, you can't say that. You can't do this, you can't do that. WHY? Because they are threatening the intended Orion order and the return of overt membership in the Orion Empire where conformity is a hallmark! This is a great time for low through mid incarnational experiences, for they live to conform, but very trying for the spiritually advanced and a real burden for Final Incarnations. The more controls, the more of the body, the bane of spiritual development. 141"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Body vs. Spirit Control Once you've reached your Final Incarnation, you may discover that when you interact with the residents of Earth you are talking to both the body and the spirit. If the spirit is immature, as it is from the first incarnation through mid-range incarnations, it is the body and its DNA commands that you are communicating with. Most sex, physical activities and so on are of the body. The need for participating in or watching organized sporting events is of the body. There is no judgment call there, but it is a valid observation. As the spirit matures, shim (being the animating spiritual extension from the Higher Self) gets slowly increasing input from the Higher Self. Spiritual interests are one of the spirit's interests. This is not to be confused with religious pursuits as those are control methods of the body orchestrated by alien groups. The more spiritual one becomes, the less physical oriented and the less religious. Once one has evolved beyond the need to watch or participate in organized sports, for example, you have entered a more advanced incarnation. The physical body is violent and self-gratifying. If you tiy to reason with someone who wants to get violent with you, you are appealing to the spirit, NOT to the body. If the spirit is mature enough, shim can override the body's violent tendency. The body seems to want to act violently much of the time and you may find these thoughts moving through your mind. However, despite these thoughts, the advanced spirit will be able to keep the body from acting on them. It's one thing to say 'I'm going to beat you' and another thing to actually do it. Spiritual control over these body functions is a major goal. Road rage is of the body. The desire for knowledge is of the spirit. If the spirit is minion incarnational, then you can run into more problems. Those can be appealed to by buying them off in some manner. They do not respond to reason. Only a Higher Self incarnation will respond to reason. When dealing with a body-controlled person, you may well have to talk in terms the body will understand. A trying time is when you have 50% body control and 50% spirit control. There's a constant clash of wills. The spirit will eventually win with more incarnations. The spirit progresses, while the body remains pretty much the same. Again, we ALL must go from first incarnation and body-rule to Final Incarnation and 95% spirit-rule. The 5% is the cushion given to appease the body so it will be minimally satisfied. It can be satisfied by pleasures but you must resist destructive things such as drugs and alcohol abuse. These will override your spirit's control. The body responds well to rewards like chocolate, physical things and amusements of a non-destructive nature. You will find rewarding the body will allow the spirit to develop with less hindrance. An example: when learning astral travel - the body does not want to participate. It'll twitch, itch and basically bitch and moan. It fears death and the removal of the spirit. You have to talk to it as you would a child. \"If you let me have 15 minutes to do this, I'll treat you to some ice cream.\" This type of interaction will work. Once the spirit has advanced in astral travel, you no longer have to do this to the body except as a treat for not giving you difficulties.

This means 95% of control of will. The body wants to do all body-oriented pursuits, has minimal interest in intellectual pursuits and zero interest in spiritual pursuits. This 95% includes realizing that the body is simply a vehicle for the spirit and nothing more. \"Good morning\" said person X to person Y. \"What's so good about it?\" responds person Y. \"At least you're alive\" says person X. That comment is pure body. The spirit knows it cannot die. The body fears dying so will do almost anything to keep alive. A spirit- controlled person would never respond as person X did. Almost everything is geared to the body in this country: Lose weight, don't eat this, don't eat that, use fluoride, get all your shots, HIV causes AIDS, worry about cholesterol, use make-up, dye your hair, worry what others think, conform...conform...conform. These and much more are ALL for the body's concern so you continue to produce for the masters of the world. You chose the way of death of the body before you were incarnated. Once the spirit is in control, you realize the futility of worrying about what the above. Once the spirit begins to exert control over the body, shim takes interest in the psychic and related matters which will eventually lead the spirit to shim's Higher Self and the Final Incarnation. In very advanced incarnations, the spirit knows much more about shimself and will discard more and more of the body's concerns to conform. This never sits well with the masses and they will try to reclaim you through varying methods. Once entered into lower advanced levels, you may slide back. Eventually you will succeed and will spurn those who try to drag you back into their lower states. As your spirit control grows, the body’s will fades proportionately. You will still reward the body with trinkets or chocolate or ice cream or whatever it may like as a reward for cooperating with the true master of the body, the spirit animating it...the REAL you!

Body & Spirit - Controls & Experiences You can’t turn on the TV, in the U.S. at least, where there isn't an onslaught of fear centered on the body and body-ruled matters. You hear that 'this person's dead' (wail/moan), you 'HAVE to do/not do/eat/not eat whatever to keep the body living longer', 'take this drug, use that drug, have your body Probed' because 'something (gasp) may be creeping up on your it'. Germs, wash, paranoia, FEAR ... all for the body's concerns. Even with politics, it's all body-based fears. The American government says, 'if you don’t allow us to put in place more fascist controls over you, some unnamed terrorist may do something in this country'. Fear, FEAR, FEAR!!! The physical body reacts to this every time. Panic sets in. This is a self-preservation response heightened by the alien DNA commands. All facets of society want us to believe it's all about the survival of the body. More myths: all life is 'sacred', the 'hallowed/sacred' ground of NYC where those 2 towers had their event (the government responsible), and the 'hallowed/sacred' ground in Oklahoma where (the government again) blew up that building. You can think of many more. Physical bodies reign over Higher Self incarnates because the incarnates are not spiritually able to override the body. Looking a bit closer, one might ask if that means that the Higher 143"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Self is also immature. The answer is 'no'. The Higher Self allows extensions of shimself to incarnate, as per the Game and the Games rules. Remember, the bottom line of 3rd density incarnations is EXPERIENCE. If the incarnating spirit entered with FULL awareness, that would nullify most of the experiences. Even with sequential incarnations, the first incarnation is a blank page. The remembering of past lives only goes back to their first incarnation. The sequential Higher Selves must also play by the rules of the Game as it applies to them. The Game, for simultaneous and sequential incarnations, has the Higher Self as the repository for ALL of that Higher Selfs incarnational experiences and pulses down information to shim's incarnations based on what experiences shim's had and still needs. Therefore, the Awakened Final Incarnation has the most input from the Higher Self and is aware of things other incarnations of the same Higher Self either are not aware of at all or only to certain degrees. The Dominant incarnations are ONE of those more aware, and that depends, too. My purpose here is not to go into all those details, but to let you know there is a method/plan for each Higher Selfs incarnational cycle in 3rd density Earth (the fast pace) or in sequential 3rd density worlds - an agonizingly SLOW pace from an Earther Higher Self perspective. In low and mid level incarnations, the Higher Selfs incarnations vary, from 'blank slates' to minimal spiritual control. This allows their 'physicals' do it's thing, and these 'things' are the experiences, both good and bad, that help the spirit develop. It is also VERY important for the incarnations to see, to taste, to smell, to feel, to eat, etc as much as they can with all shim's incarnations. ALL these sensory experiences are stored within the Higher Self. EVERYTHING that ALL incarnations have done is contained in the Higher Selfs perfect memory. Remember, judging/good & evil are all 3rd density control devices. They don't exist in higher densities. They are all just different experiences. Few of you who read this can handle what goes on in conversations among those who have long overcome the false limitations of 'the sacred body'. When you don’t support the physical's supreme stance, you can be labeled 'morbid', 'insensitive', 'unfeeling' or whatever. These terms are all used to enforce the body's control over the spirit. Once the spirit has matured enough, usually in Very Advanced and higher incarnations, you begin to see the body for the dead end, temporary vehicle it is. The body/life isn’t 'sacred'. NOTHING is sacred. If anything, EXPERIENCE is what the Higher Self treasures. Every experience /sensation that the Higher Self has had through shim's incarnations can be duplicated on higher densities exactly as it was on 3rd density. You like the taste of a vanilla milkshake? The experience of the taste, texture, temperature, etc., is all stored within your Higher Self, and may be used AT WILL by you, as your Higher Self, especially when the Final Incarnation is complete and that Final Incarnation has summoned all other of shim's incarnations to return. The Final Incarnation then adjusts to ALL shim's incarnations and moves forward. How wonderful. This segment is complex and there's far more to it. I expect most of you will not be able to grasp it in its entirety. Deal with what you can and push the rest to the side.

How many times have you seen or heard someone say, \"I won't let him/her go because I love him/her\"? Just watch the parade of minions and low-level incarnations on the Jerry Springer show. These people don't 'love' the object of these statements, they only seek to control and dictate to them, which is anything BUT love. My Sexual Prisoner article reflects some of this intent. Sex is totally of the body. The huge sex drive was notched up by Orion genetic scientists to make people breed for the Empire. Americans are such prudes about sex due to the perverse influences of religion and that it is a Cancer country, astrologically. Since sex, for people who would like to identify themselves with religion (control), so-called decency (control) and similar, is so taboo (Orion genetic command structure), they have twisted the word 'love' to be the substitute word for 'lust'. Someone meets someone else and wants to hop in bed. This is lust, not love. Love at first sight is the body's way of saying lust at first sight. Any partnership based on sex/sexual needs as primary is doomed to failure. 'Let's make love' someone says, but they really mean is 'let's fuck'. Using 'love' is soothing to their warped ethics. Using 'fuck' forces them to face what they want. Therefore 'fuck' is shunned. Foolish people. Affection is the spirit ID. This is NOT sex, even though sex may occasionally be the result. Affection is what you take into higher densities. Sex is left behind in 3rd density. Affection is very common in higher densities. Affection translates into non-sexual romance, hugging, cuddling, holding hands, kissing, and similar on Earth. You can love someone and never want to have sex with them because you connect with their spirit and not their body ID. The First Law of the Universe - Like Attracts Like - warns of the folly of cross gender sex, and I've covered this already in other material. However when it's spirit to spirit, the woman's best friend is her female friend or a gay man as sex is not an object. The man's best friend is his male friend. Unfortunately, het men do not tend to mix well with lesbians as gay men do with het women. Another flaw in the het male structure. In Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean countries, people are closer to expressing their spirit without the artificial constraints of German/British Isles/Irish body ID, anti-spirit attitudes. True to spirit, affection is NOT by any means limited to opposite genders. Many men are affectionate with women as a means to an end. Then, once married (a curse on this Orion command), romance quickly fades. As one man said on TV, 'no use to chase the bus once you've caught it'. That's because the Orion DNA commands are ALL about breeding for the Empire and keeping you away from discovering who you really are. The short circuiting that occurs when male and female get together intimately (as I've already discussed) will reinforce the lie and deny the spirit. \"I feel like a man trapped in a woman's body\" or \"I feel like a woman trapped in a male's body\" are both of the body, NOT of the spirit. The person who says this has not matured enough to grasp the spiritual connections. The spirit is male AND female. When you are body ID, your body controls your spirit, you will only be intimate with the opposite gender (and the Orion Empire is pleased). When you are spirit ID, your body will be intimate with who you desire without regard to gender. When you are spirit ID AND Awakened to the Laws of the Universe, you can have affection for the opposite gender, but will shun sex with it to keep you progressing spiritually and not risk shorting out due to chemical/electrical imbalances in heterosexuality.

The Vibration of Affection (Special Gold Edition Segment) Everyone knows about affection and the giving/receiving of it. You can see the demonstrations of affection between humans and between mammals. Affection must not be thought of as sex. That's a whole different matter since even non-affectionate creatures and beings engage in sex for procreation. For them, it has nothing to do with affection. The vibration of sex is Mars. The vibration of affection is Venus. They are very different. Affection is definitely not limited to physical beings. If you hear that it is, you are hearing another myth. The expression of affection varies with Higher Self incarnates, both simultaneous and sequential. Certain species require more and others far less. This is an aspect of the physical that they incarnate into. Earther humans seem to require more affection/touch than any other race. This is due to the nature of simultaneously incarnating, on one hand, and the mammalian genetics that were instilled in Ancient Earthers by alien genetic scientists. This was not done for the matter of affection. It was done because the aliens wanted certain animal qualities in their human creations. Affection was a by-product. Touch is very much necessary for Higher Self incarnations. This can come through close friendships (both sexual and not) or massage therapies. While the vehicle is physical touch, it is the spirit energy that flows from compatible spirit energies that really enhance the experience. You can have a massage from the opposite gender that feels physically relaxing. The female will take energies from the male no matter if she is the therapist or the client. The responses given will be dictated by the alien DNA commands and the shorting out of spiritual development occurs as per other Matrix 5 segments. If the therapies are given by same gender participants, you stand to not only have the physically relaxing feeling but also have a spiritual energy enhancement. This energy enhancement can also come from non-sexual, affectional contact. This can be through hugs, hand holding, sitting side-by-side in contact and so on. The mix of physical/spiritual contact is extremely enhancing to the people involved. Same gender affection can set off body defenses in those with weaker incarnational spirits who cannot override the DNA commands. Remember, as I have written in other segments, the body has commands that stimulate fear in same gender contact. This is on purpose and one of the loops that must be overcome by the Advancing spirit. People who still identify themselves as heterosexual are the most limited by these commands, especially those in male bodies. This is because the male body has the maximum creative ability and is more 146"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. capable of dramatic changes if this ability is awakened. The DNA command reaction is strongest in this type of body. When we drop dead, the need for affection does not end. Remember, it is primarily a spirit thing. You can be even more affectionate in the astral without a body as the spirit energies are unfettered by the 3rd density body and its myriad of DNA commands. Affection on higher densities can be quite a light/sensation show by those who share this feeling for each other. A 'down' spirit can brighten considerably when another chooses to share affection with shim. Another item to remember beyond the physical body, you are no longer shorted out because genders do not exist beyond the 3rd density except as illusion. There is no shorting out as with Earther bodies. The affectional process will be with us always as we progress to new experiences. It is one of the rewards of a maturing spirit and one of the pleasures that we truly enjoy sharing. If you have difficulty receiving affection here, remember that it will pass. There are also occasions where your Higher Self will give shim's incarnation(s) a pulse of pure affection. If you can experience that, you have a glimpse of what affection is outside of 3rd density limitations. The Earth Human Body and the Higher Self The alien genetic scientists split the perfect human body vehicle for a Higher Self to incarnate and created 2 inharmonious genders loaded with Orion/Sirius DNA commands and alien genes as well. The new Earth human body was a servant of the Empire and the greatest challenge for a Higher Self to incarnate into. The body has demands and programs that can only be overridden by a very advanced Higher Self incarnation. This happens in slow stages. Some internal shorts to the DNA program have occurred allowing the First Law of Creation to shine through - Like attracts like in the physical too - homosexual incarnations. The Dark manipulation of Ancient Earth humans presented a unique opportunity for rapid advancement of those Higher Selves who chose the challenge of Earth incarnations. Robert Monroe, in his trilogy, explores some of these. When the Higher Self begins the Earth mode incarnational process, it realizes it will need many hundreds of incarnations for the spirit to achieve control of the Dark engineered physical body due to the nature of the control. As the spirit learns, it will begin to try and exert itself over the powerful body controls. Organized religion was created to make a false spiritual cage for a novice to mid-level spirit to flounder in. All organized, major, hierarchal religions have alien control at the highest levels. Try leaving one of these religions and see how family and others who belong will try and shame or pressure you to return. Leaving of a major religion for another, even if for another major religion, is a sign of spirit realizing there must be something better. It can still take many more incarnations for this restlessness of spirit to drop all major religions. This is one reason for the New Age religions. These are intended to be the golden cage for the spirit after it leaves the iron cage of the one god religions. That this new cage had to be developed is unsettling to the Empire and a main reason in their consideration for re­ engineering Earth humans all over again. Advanced, Dominant and Final incarnations are not what they want. They want to recycle low to lower mid-level spirits into another breeding, productive incarnation. Hence the Light and Tunnel at death trap.

They project the person(s) image in the white light tunnel and the image waves you in deeper (See Matrix II for more on which group, a member of the Orion Empire, is involved and where their generator is). If you CHOOSE to follow, you can be trapped and sent to another incarnation of their choice. This shows the Empire does have an understanding of the spirit, but it attempts to short this out. The Light and Tunnel trap is a relatively new device, but one that will fail and they now know this. 'Go into the Light' say those who have had near death experiences. They are the salespersons chosen to advertise this alien venture. NEVER enter that light. Go up, left, right, back or anywhere but there. The mass media exposure of the Light and Tunnel trap (seen in the film, 'Ghost' where the hero willingly enters the glittering trap) is to try and get people to buy the destination. This tends to play especially well on the belief structures of the Light polarity. Robert Monroe's works have gone far in educating upper mid-level and advanced spirits into avoiding this trap. The aliens know well of their less than stunning success here. The body is the gender. It's male or female. The spirit is not the gender as it realizes that genders are a mutation of the spirit on 3rd density. The bodies' commands are numerous as is its survival mechanism. Several DNA commands are time activated. The female demand to control, dominate and transform the male to her wishes is strictly the Orion model. The male desires to breed a dynasty is the Sirian model. As both genetic scientists from Orion and Sirius were involved in the creation of Earth genders, both wanted Earth to be a micro-version of their alliance. Both Orion and Sirius are violent and aggressive. Orion is female dominated. Sirius is male dominated. As above, so below. Sirius attempted (in the very far past) to invade Orion. They lost and the Orion queen formed an alliance with Sirius. Since Orion was far more advanced technologically, the Sirians entered the alliance rather than be destroyed. Sirius has become an arm of the Orion military. Back to Earth's genetic manipulations - The Orion genetic scientists made sure that the female would be programmed to eventually dominate the male, first through deception and then overtly. The males were given DNA commands to protect the females and, eventually by timed command, to be overtly subservient to them. This is advancing rapidly in America which has cultural/material control of most of the world with its dazzling lights. You know it is of the body if it is gender-specific demands. You know it is of the spirit when it discards gender-specific demands. Example: Feminists groups demanding violence against women laws. That is the furthering of the Orion model. The spirit would want violence, against people to be the model. This includes the true, but overblown violence against women, but ignores the vastly understated violence against men as women increasingly believe that they have the 'right' to slap, punch and do other forms of violence and humiliation against men. Like attracts like! The manipulative trait of the female is an Orion attribute. One must cease all forms of violence in order for it to cease returning to you and this also means mental violence and trying to change people (men) instead of accepting them for themselves. This, though, is counter to the Game and Orion program. Now, advanced spirits, having had many incarnations as female and male, have learned more and the spirit is able to override more of the physical. You can hear someone talk in a spiritual mode, then throw in some of their gender's demands. \"Reincarnation, spirit, blah- blah...but the goddess is who we should worship.\" Warning... gender-specific to a non­ existent deity. The 'goddess' is a code name for the Orion queen.

Females blaming their problems on males is genderized and external victimhood (it’s their fault). It is also Orion which, at first, was ruled by a king. The reptilian female blamed its self-generated problems on males as well. They eventually launched their violent coup on the king and his cabinet and took control. Orion reptilian females can spit a deadly poison which makes them formidable warriors. The geneticists were not going to give this ability to the Earth female, not wanting to eventually set up a potential rival, but they enhanced the Earth female ability to poison the mind to get their way. This has been done for ages. This is of the body, not the occupying spirit. Today western, primarily American females, who are their body, are attempting to advance their agenda and control, not only of males where they reside, but also in other countries where THEY feel they should meddle. The UN’s Women’s Conference was held to advance their agenda. Well, who's behind the UN? The constant barrage of women yes, men no is Orion, and is also a mini-version of Orion's will over Sirius'. This' MUST happen according to Dark's plan. This is known to Final Incarnations and, at least to a certain degree, to Dominants. As in 'heaven', so on Earth. The Game’s rules have entered a new stage (in the last century) to incorporate overt inclusion into the Orion Empire once again, now that the Throne of Mintaka has turned its attention here once again. The main learning in this section is if someone, no matter how advanced they'd like others to believe they are, speak of single gender only demands, it is of the body. The goal is for the spirit to control 95% of the body in so far as making the spirit express itself. Reward the body with something it craves, pizza or chocolate, for example, if it cooperates, but be aware that until you have reached a certain level of control, it will seek to exert itself and its commands over your spirit. Never forget that the body's control over spirit: marriage, breeding, religions, ethnicity, nationality, gender control/dominance and more are ALL the body in control. The Higher Selfs mission is, by accepting Earth human incarnations, to educate the immature spirit to eventually mature and control 95% of the physical, escape from the gender identification and learn Spiritual truths while realizing religion is of the body and Earth is only a beginning and the Game will end. Religion and spirituality are mutually exclusive. It is of Orion to equate the two as the same thing. The more spiritual you get, the less religious you get. It is also of Orion to elevate the female over the male. Roger Ebert, film critic, commented that one of Gene Siskel's pet peeves in film was to portray women as saints, kids are colorful and men are violent, evil and everything else negative. Remember the Orion plan. This information can greatly assist the Finals and Dominants no matter which gender they occupy. African Tradition of Gender Split Credo Mutwa, Zulu Shaman, has revealed his African traditions in relation to Ancient earth humans and alien genetic scientists in a double video set available through www.davidicke.com. Credo talks about how before the reptilians got here, Earth was covered in clouds (like Venus) always. Also, there were no genders for the humans here! Briefly (Credo talks in more detail), when the reptilians got here, they promised the Earthers that they would 'make them gods'. They knew they couldn't control Earthers MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 149"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"without genders and without speech. Earthers at this time were totally telepathic. They sweet-talked them into going into either a green cave or an orange cave. I think this is the legend for genetic chambers where Earther DNA was cut up and altered. If they went in the green, they came out female. If they went in orange, they came out male. “Males” and “Females” instantly disliked each other. This carries through even to today. Females didn't like the 'snake' men had between their legs. Males didn't like the breasts on females. They avoided each other. This wasn't good for the reptilians who wanted them as slaves. They taught them speech, but different speech to different groups. This further divided them. Then the reptilian 'Isis' taught them about sex. They were swapping partners all around just using them for sex. On and on the story goes. Men have to be taught (reptilian command) to be with females for procreation only. Young boys resist this, going back to the pre-reptilian times where there were no genders. Young girls also resist this, but their DNA is made stronger to bear children. More on Gender Split With sexuality, the fault lies with the alien genetic scientists and those who were foolish enough to believe them. One could also say it was part of an overall plan to make Earth incarnations the huge difficulties, but great spiritual growth potential, they are. I can see why many refuse current Earth incarnations. Those that take the challenge though, will grow faster and experience much more than those who refuse Earth mcarnations. However, I move forward now to discuss spirits inhabiting Earth physical bodies. The spirit, as I've always said, is neither male nor female but encompasses both in one. This was accurately reflected in ancient Earth humans as a one gender. When the immortal spirit activates a human body, the spirit is subdued by the genetics of that body. Example: electricity put into a proper device causes it to work perfectly. Electricity (still the same) put into a defective device can mean it either doesn't work or works poorly. The alien scientists caused the perfect device to become defective. If the spirit cannot overcome the huge flaws in human bodies, it will operate defectively. As a spirit develops, depending on how far it wants to develop in the Earth experience, it will seek out bisexual and gay bodies to express itself in. There are 'failures' in some bodies. Failures in DNA coding cause ancient memories to slip in. If the genetic scientists' failures are significant enough, you enter a gay or lesbian body (in regard to sexual orientation). If the failures are only marginal, you enter a bisexual body. If the alien DNA damage is totally active, you enter a heterosexual body. You notice how people make their closest friendships in same sex people ... the guy with his 'boys' and the woman with her 'girlfriends', as it should be. Then, the alien DNA damage pops in PLUS society's commands/'god'(alien) commands to be with the opposite gender in order to breed. The alien 'god' needs more humans on the farm, after all. In ancient Earth, the population was very low. People didn't live to breed like they do on Earth after it became subject to alien rule. The reptilians believe in “divide and conquer”. This is why they divided the perfect ancient Earth human bodies into flawed genders - in order to conquer Earth and divide the natives. In a het body, a REAL het body and not a closeted bisexual, although the person can form his/her closest bonds with same sex friends, they do not let their spirit control their direction.

THAT'S BECAUSE THE SPIRIT KNOWS IT'S AN ABOMINATION TO BE WITH THOSE THAT DON'T VIBRATE LIKE YOU!!! You constantly hear what's ‘wrong’ with men from women and what's ‘wrong’ with women from men...yet they STILL violate these spiritual warning flags to please their reptilian masters. The physical alien damage and society (religion/conformity) keep you in place. The aliens are pleased with you. You do what they want you to. Despite your deep affections to your same sex friends, you cannot consider living with them in an intimate relationship. This means you deny the spirit to please the alien masters. Breeders, the lowest of human incarnations, but one we all have to experience for our growth. With bisexuals, there is a degree of release from the alien commands, true. The spirit has more say. They will have sex with either gender BUT they want to appear conforming by ONLY living with the opposite gender. The spirit is acknowledged in sex, but not on the emotional level. That's why most bisexuals will have sex, but won't kiss same gender. They are not able to cross the genetic chasm set up by the aliens. They also say that being bi is the 'best of both worlds'. That is not true, because their world is sex and not the real reason for sex (an exchange of spiritual energies). Bisexuals cave-in to the physical while feeling 'something' from ancient Earth past. Homosexuals are the most connected to their animating spirit. The alien codes are short- circuited. The ancient Earth 'normality' shines through, much to alien displeasure. This displeasure is shown in religion and most societies as horror, repulsiveness, shame, etc. They want to 'change' you...yeah, like the aliens did to ancient Earth perfection!!! Be like us, they say. \"God\" wants it/'god' condemns you. Who the fuck is this 'god'...the damned reptilian aliens and their allies! The 'god' of conformity, the 'god' of control, the 'god' of the mindless sheep! Now, while the spirit in a gay/lesbian body is able to control the body and knows, from ancient Earth, that you should be with someone physically like you, without advanced spiritual training, they just don't get it. I gave a lecture on the spiritual nature of gays/lesbians in 1997. Talk about trying to teach something to the dim bulbs! Unfortunately, most gays, due to the constant barrage of 'you're not normal, you're an abomination', have closed down the avenues that will allow them to move beyond the alien controls in hets. One does have to be in a later incarnation to allow the spirit great enough control over the physical to ignore the masses. None of the 3 sexual orientations have the spiritual stuff right, so that they can explore and find their own way to spiral out of this prison planet JUST by their sexual orientation. We must undergo ALL sexual orientations, strengthening the spirit's experiences. The stronger/more experience the spirit gets by having hundreds of incarnations, the more it can control the body when, in later incarnations, he/she chooses a gay or lesbian incarnation to ALLOW THE SPIRIT THE BEST EXPRESSION POSSIBLE IN CURRENT DAY EARTH. Ancient Earth was the ideal. Robert Monroe said this, as well as Credo Mutwa and myself. Monroe told one of my groups that if you want to live in a past Earth, don't go to Atlantis, go back to Ancient Earth with full telepathic abilities, no war and no genders! The constant fighting between genders reflects a deep recognition that “there is something wrong”. The chopped-up DNA we have within our bodies partially dealt with the telepathic abilities that were natural.

Taking It One Step Further The spirit/physical connection has a double cause of flaws. First, the physical, due to meddlers messing with Earth human DNA (going back to Ancient Earth, as I’ve already discussed with you). Second is the maturity/development of the Spirit. Once the Spirit (in connection with the Higher Self gaining experiences) has matured, shim will overcome certain flaws in the DNA even if stuck in a het or bi physical. The Spirit is all powerful, but shim has to learn that it is, and learn how to develop shim’s abilities and gain the wisdom that knowledge should bring. The immature Spirit MUST learn, experience and gain wisdom to function efficiently. The maturing Spirit must continue this process, but once begun, the spiral to sail away is also started. Minion incarnations will NOT develop this way, but that’s a different story. Here, I’m only discussing incarnations with Higher Selves. Put on a suit of armor. How can your physical move around in it? Not at all fluid, not in the manner it can move without the armor. It’s the same with the Spirit. View the physical as a “suit of clumsy armor” restricting the movement of the Spirit. However, unlike this comparison, once the maturing Spirit gets into the physical, shim can overcome the limitations of the armor (physical) no matter what the orientation. True a gay or lesbian physical is far easier to adapt to, like chain mail (gay/lesbian) to plate mail (het). There is more fluidity to chain mail than plate. This information should make you all think and search deeper. Male/Female Aspects In Ancient Earth, the human was both male and female in one being. The alien meddlers came and split the genders and, among other things, weakened the spirit’s expression through the physical body. Depending on if one chose the creative male body or the nurturing female body, the other aspect was suppressed. The male body produces life by itself - the living sperm. The female body does not produce life by itself, but rather is the host for the living sperm, which uses the female egg matrix to develop. The female is the incubator for this event, but NOT the creator of life. It is not the female aspect. Females who create other than life (which they can’t), are tapping into their male part of their spirit. It is not enough to overcome the limitation of the female body to create physical life, BUT it does create mental (music, art, etc) and translates that into the physical.

In gay/lesbian bodies, the meddler DNA commands are neutralized thus allowing the Ancient Earth ‘Like Attracts Like’ (which is the natural order). The spirit can show more of itself in these bodies, although the lesbian body (due to meddlers creating genders) still cannot create life, which is quite frustrating to the spirit occupying. The inability to create life by females is part of their bitterness, part of the reason why they started the myth that life is created by them. It is not. Why can't females be happy being females? Because the spirit knows it is wrong to be split into gender ...unnatural. Unfortunately, without the proper spiritual education, the genders don’t know why things are as they are. The suppression currently “in vogue” - the suppression of the male (giver of life) has to do with the intended return of the meddlers and their queen, a female dominated society. The false idea that “female is superior to male” started with them and caught on due to the insecure nature of the vast majority of females on this planet. True, they should be treated equally, but their purposes are quite different. As it says in the Handbook, one of the major problems with Earth is the females inhabiting it (centered on the American continent). The females are playing into the hand of the meddlers instead o f being true to their spirit. There are exceptions, but they are few, far between and ignored by the too vocal majority. Much more could be said about these topics, but enough for now. Givers of Life Myth would have everyone believe that the female is the giver of life, the source of life. This is false. The male is the giver of life. The sperm is alive when leaving the male, alive all on its own. It seeks the female egg as the egg is the matrix needed for the sperm to advance in its life. The egg, by itself, is just a lump of matter. It has no life of its own. The myth of female as the giver of life came from those uneducated who saw the female as the one who bears a child. The female is the bearer of life NOT the giver of life. The female is the oven for the bread to bake. The female serves an important purpose in the life game started by the reptilians when they split humans into 2 genders. The myth serves the reptilians, who are a female-dominated society. To keep the female as central is necessary for them. While males and females should be treated equally, they are not equal. Each has it's strong points and weaknesses, due to reptilian meddling. Why do females insist they can do anything a male can do? Credo Mutwa says, in his video, that females worship any being they feel is above them. This is why females aren't happy being females alone, they try to become men. Males (except for drag queens-but that's another story) don't want to become as females. It’s because the females are more sensitive to what they lost in Ancient Earth than most males are. But instead of trying to understand what happened and why, they mistakenly believe they can absorb male traits by emulating them...dressing like men, talking like men, hanging with men but at the same time almost constantly criticizing men. It is not that one gender is superior to another, it's that they are both different with different purposes. Equal treatment yes, but if females really want to be on par with males, M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

The Orion queen is returning. Females will be in control, NOT Earth human females, but reptilian females. The reptilian part of the human brain is vibrating to the advancing reptilian overt take-over. Put 2 and 2 together. Lesbian Energies I’ve already explained some matters with sexuality. There is more to understand on lesbian energy, since the female physical is dependent on recharging from the male (giver of life). It is similar to the explanation of gay male physical. As with the gay male, the lesbian physical’s SPIRIT is able to handle the physical body due to a disruption of meddler DNA changes. As ALL spirits are both male and female, thus the same energy, the spirit needs no rechareing as the physical does. The spirit in a lesbian body (as with gay men) KNOWS it doesn’t need the opposite physical gender. It also KNOWS the opposite gender, in sexual relationships, can have an unwanted effect that will inhibit growth. This inhibition factor w*as designed by the meddlers to restrict spiritual growth. One thing to keep in mind, just because the spirit has optimum growth possibilities in a gay or lesbian body, doesn’t mean the spirit is more advanced. Nope. A spirit can choose a gay/lesbian body while immature for certain experiences. This is very obvious. A more advanced spirit can and does have het incarnations to gain other types of experiences that we all need. Put an advanced spirit in a gay/lesbian body and you have potential for tremendous growth, accomplishing in l incarnation what would have taken several incarnations. This is what I chose for my Final Incarnation. This is MY oath, not THE path. Remember what 1 told you in my Incarnations piece. At different times in your own spiritual development you DO chose gay, lesbian and bisexual physicals. You NEED ALL these experiences to progress onward and continue your spiral out. Back to lesbian physical - the spirit knows the opposite gender is not needed as it generates enough energy by itself. The storage battery aspect of the female is neutralized by a glitch in the DNA that the meddlers did not count on. The lesbian does not ‘need’ a male just as the gay man does not ‘need’ a female. The spirit, whether mature, immature or somewhere in- between, is in control. It is possible for a man or woman to cause the glitch in the DNA physical if the spirit advances enough through its oivn awakening. The spirit can accomplish ANYTHING. There are men and women who were hets for significant parts of their lives, then they seem to awaken to a new path that requires a gay or lesbian body. This is the spirit evolving sufficiently enough to CAUSE the DNA glitch. These people have families, but realize they must now chose a path more suited to their awakened status. This does NOT work in reverse. Once the glitch appears in the physical, it can not be removed by others. (True, if a genetics lab got a hold of them, it would be possible to do, but only by physically going in and altering the DNA as was done in ancient Earth.) The glitch can be temporarily suppressed and the person can try to conform to what fellow prisoners on the planet Earth would like (meddler’s Earth), but it is too powerful to suppress for long. Astrologically, the energies for this are the planet Uranus (gay life in general/gay males specific) and Neptune (lesbian energy combined with Uranus). URANUS WILL <NOT> BE DENIED. It’s the ONLY planet that cannot be circumvented. Roll with it and you do well. Fight it and you WILL suffer. Uranus rules the upcoming chaos described in the Handbook.

This is excellent for the spirit to learn. However, for a Final Incarnation, the female body would be a major impairment for such an advanced spirit because the body cannot produce life and has always to be recharged from a male (unless lesbian), but even if lesbian, cannot produce life. The Final Incarnation needs unlimited creative ability/force that is impeded by a female body. Of course if a Higher Self wants to have a Final as a female body, shim can. Also, it was far more advantageous in a female form in pre-i85o's female bodies when they were true females. The Orion DNA activation in both female AND male bodies makes modern females far less likely to be compatible for a Final Incarnation. It would seem that the Higher Self (it is in my case) would want the most advantageous physical for the Final to operate as smoothly as possible. This is true in a male incarnation. Two of my Dominant Incarnations were female, but pre-i850’s: one very psychic and one very interesting. You won’t have psychic interests or inclinations unless you’ve had female incarnations. Once you’ve had numerous, psychic interested female incarnations, the spirit has learned what shim needs and takes that information over into male incarnations. Shim can go back and forth until shim gets to the level needed to carry the information into a male creative incarnation that will use the psychic information learned. The male physical can handle this spirit far better. There is no frustration at having lost the ability to create life. Too many frustrations in modern female bodies. Therefore, my conclusion is the odds are heavily favored for a Final Incarnation to be male. There MAY be exceptions, but then there may not be either. It’s an individual Higher Selfs decision and I won’t be conducting a poll of them. Just something else to consider. Equality Means Equality The predominant whine with women is that they want equality with men. They want to be treated as men treat each other, which is what equality is. THIS IS A LIE. This is the Orion DNA command in operation. The innocent, well sounding phrase of Equal Treatment is valid IF it were true. So, women want to be treated as men, that includes stripping females of their special treatments. No longer does a male excuse his mannerisms and speech nor change them when a female is around. If everyone’s the same, and women want to be treated as men, then fart and burp away guys. Do what comes natural, curse up a storm, talk sex talk and speak your mind. But wait, when you do that, the same females who whine equality suddenly complain how can he do that in front of a woman. If you can’t stand how men treat men, then don’t whine for the treatment. The First Law of the Universe - Like Attracts Like. There’s nothing more UN-alike than Earth's gendered humans. It is a planned error for Earth genders to be compared to magnetic polarity - see how they attract, when actually the Earth genders are electric as our Higher Selves are energy beings. Think as the Higher Selves are car batteries manifesting in negative (female) and positive (male) incarnations since the alien genetic scientists did their business. Touch the positive to a positive of another battery or negative to another negative, and you have a free flow of power. Touch the negative to the positive and it will blow. This is similar and far less visibly dramatic, but nevertheless true, when a male and a female get together. There is an electrical and also a chemical shock that reinforces the Orion DNA commands and makes it harder for the Higher Self to operate in the physical of Earth bodies. I 155"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"If Earth females REALLY wanted equality, they'd take the benefits along with the liabilities. THEY DO NOT. They insist on a double standard. Well, that's not equality. They were never intended to have equality, they intend superiority and control with subservient men, just as on Orion. Females believe they can say whatever THEY want to about men, but damn the male who dares think he can get away with saying similar about females. They would never get that far unless Orion also implanted latent subservient DNA commands in the male body. Women love to use the tears to get a male to submit. This is done on purpose when things aren't going their way. Women rely on tears to control a man in many instances. It is important to remember that a woman crying is like a woman breathing. So what? Women always cry and it should not be treated, in most cases, as anything more. Women screaming is another device to draw attention to themselves. When a woman perceives herself as no longer in control of a situation, the majority of them will either cry or scream. For example: 2 men decide they want to fight. A female standing nearby doesn't want it, so she screams to draw attention to herself and what she wants. If both men want to fight, let them. It's an experience for them. In this case, however, it wasn't sanctioned by the female, so she uses one of her attention grabbing weapons to bring the situation under her control. If SHE whispered some poison into a man's ear and he was fighting for her, that's another story. It has her sanction and is ok. These Orion DNA commands are far too strong for low through mid-advanced level incarnations to override. It is part of the Game and its new rules. Those who are high Advanced or Final Incarnations will take on the role of observer here, in disgust for the most part, whether male OR female. Final, Dominant or highly Advanced Incarnations never defend their gender for they recognize them for what they are. They also refuse or resist being pulled into the dramas initiated by Earth females in their quest to rule. Fortunately, this drama on Earth will shortly be undergoing drastic changes. More for you to think on. A Curse Or An Experience? A female acquaintance of mine commented how she feels unfortunate to be currently in a female body due to the awakened Orion DNA commands. I have written on the effects and the problems caused by the alien meddling and my observations from the perspective of a Final Incarnation. First of all, when reading these materials, you must read them as who you really are and NOT from your physical perspective. Defending a gender because of its nature, rather than the developing spirit within, indicates you still have a way to go in your progression. You are NOT your body. If you're \"only human\", all you will get from reading this material is the realization that you aren’t ready for it yet. While the challenge of the awakening Orion DNA began in the 19th century and has grown into the still developing monster of today, there are still places in the world where the Orion plague has not taken over. These are places where women are still women and do not seek to become men.

If the Orion mode is followed to completion, it'll be Planet of the Harpies centered in the USA (Unruly Shrews of America). BUT, it's the experiences and the challenges your spirit must overcome to rule the body and not the Orion visa-versa. To overcome the physical, you must connect to your Higher Self. Hang in there for the body ruled people will howl at you for not conforming. In Washington, the Violence Against Women act is slithered through Congress and Hillary said she wanted to go to the Senate to “do everything for women”. This is more of the same Orion crap. If it was Violence Against People act, that's a different story, but the legislation leaves it open for continued violence by females against males while banning the reverse. This caters to the Orion DNA commands and return of the Empire. When you are a very Advanced incarnation in a female body, you recognize how the body is being manipulated and can control its urges to become dominant. The seeming curse of being in this type of female body can become an excellent experience for the spirit. Your Higher Self chose that gender for specific reasons that you will discover when you connect to the Higher Self. Remember: it’s not a curse. It's an experience. Gender Problems — “Adam and Eve” On the Sci-Fi channel series, Lexx, this space trollop takes her ship and 2 assistants to an all male planet, in the opening episode. The senior male on this planet was asked, by one of the bimbo’s assistants, how they reproduce. It was correctly stated that they use some of the sperm and place it into a genetically engineered matrix and make another male when needed. The need for the female 'oven' was made obsolete. The senior male also noted that when females are in society they breed contention and a reproducing competition that destroys harmony (SO true). When you go to the bible fable of Adam and Eve, it does, in a story way, tell how there was one gender on Earth. The lie is that the alien 'gods' want you to believe there was only one being in the Garden of Eden (Earth). This was not true. They want you to believe this one being was lonely. Well, as there were many beings, not only one, they were not lonely. Next 'god' causes a deep sleep to fall on Adam (aliens drugged the one gender human), removed a rib (the cheaper cut per Archie Bunker) and formed Eve. This is a clumsy story of the genetic splitting of the Ancient earth human into 2 genders. Adam didn't become male only until 'god' took part of the body. Adam retained the creative/life-giving ability, but the matrix needed for the live sperm to develop was shuttled over to Eve. Now, in the story, Lilith is described as before Eve and Adam's first 'wife'. It could be that Lilith was Adam's companion (one of the androgynous Ancients) who opposed the genetic manipulation of Adam, therefore Lilith is called 'evil' and driven off. Remember, the bible is pure propaganda for the alien 'gods' and is NOT history but historical FICTION. A lot more could be said about that parable, but the crux of the matter is that the matrix, which the living sperm needs, is currently held within the female. In the Lexx episode, the all male planet long ago developed the matrix and therefore the female was no longer essential. The technology exists today to also create this matrix on Earth, but will never be allowed under the current reality.

The female body is technically obsolete because of the genetic solution with the matrix. The optimum, however, is recombining the genders on Earth. If they pulled them apart, they could rejoin them. This will NOT happen, though. The next thing to ask all of you is who are you? Are you your body or is the body merely a convenience to gain experiences? If you are your body, you will object to the elimination of the female body because your spirit is either not mature enough to have access to this type of information and therefore you are your body or you are a minion spirit. If you're reading this and you are body identified, the first option applies. Minions will never read Matrix V. If you are your body, the genetic perversion of heterosexuality is the icon for you. Well, we've ALL had to go through that and have learned much from those experiences. But now it's time to spiral out of that lower vibration. In order to spiral out, you must know what has happened to Ancient Earth and the deceptions that still go on today and why they continue. The female construct comes directly from the Orion model. Something to remember is that genders are a 3rd density event. Your spirit is BOTH male and female. Genders do NOT exist in the upper dimensions and, on the astral, only illusions of former 3rd density experiences would have one believe genders are “standard in the spirit world.” Once freed from the genetic flaws of the current earth body AND the spirit has matured enough to receive information from your higher Selves, you will look at the current situation for how it is beyond and apart from the illusion and lies created by superior alien technologies. If you are still body controlled, you will continue to believe the lies generated by the Game regardless of what you read in Matrix V. The good news is that, you will Advance and move beyond your current limitations.. That you are receiving this type of information says that if you're not there yet, you are close to being there. Even if you don't reach that level in your current incarnation, the information you’re reading in Matrix VIS stored in your Higher Self and maturing spirit. Once it clicks, you'll know what I mean and what you have to do next. Reading the Handbook trilogy is a great way to progress. Reinforcing The Limitation of Genders Last night (Dec 21, 2000), I was invited to a Winter Solstice gathering. It was a small gathering. At one point, the host and hostess had us gather around a small bonfire and they individually started calling on (non-existent) deities. Finally they gave some herbs to the females and some tobacco to the males. These were to be thrown into the fire when their individual wishes were made. The herb was laurel, a traditionally female plant, while tobacco is considered male. I did not participate in the deity worship, but rather observed. For the very Advanced and Final Incarnations reading this, these ceremonies reinforce the illusion that spirit is male and female. Yes, the physical is, but the animating spirit is both male AND female. As I've stated before, there are no individual genders beyond 3rd density. Those who choose to retain their 3rd density gender on the astral eventually lose it and return to their normal state. When given some task 'that is female' or 'that is male', the thumb on your crown chakra is reinforced. In actuality, due to the nature of your spirit and Higher Self, you can perform either male or female tasks. This is why when you participate in an all female or an all male circle, the energy is SO potent, far more so than in a mixed gender circle. In the one gender circles, both male and female tasks are done by the same gender.

This DNA short is to keep you from finding out who you really are and, therefore, delay your departure from the 3rd density cycle. Even if you are by yourself, you can do any type of ceremony you may choose by using your spirit, NOT your physical, I usually avoid these “circle events” due to their continuation of looking for external salvation and deities. You get to a point where you've moved beyond this stage - usually in VERY Advanced, and definitely during the Final Incarnation. Gender Role Reversals The Orion DNA commands in BOTH males and females continues their steady march to an Orion society. In USA Weekend Aug 25-27, 2000, in the Family section is an article on 'stay-at-home' fathers. This is one of the Orion role reversals required for complete Orion dominance when the Queen returns and Earth becomes fully Orion overtly controlled. Here are 2 quotes from the article which boasts \"2 million U.S. dads now stay home with the kids\": -Web sites devoted to stay-at-home fathers sell T-shirts with slogans such as \"Men Who Change Diapers Change the World\". The At-Home Dad Network support group now BRAGS (my emphasis) 30 chapters - which do doubt duty as play groups for the kids - around the country.\" -\"Stay-at home dads are changing more than just diapers. They’re altering attitudes. [A father] in Clifton, NJ, BRAGS (my emphasis) that his 7 year old son says he wants to be a stay-at-home dad when he grows up. And it's changing the way daughter, 5, plays house. Says [the father]:\"I heard them upstairs saying, 'we're going to work, and the dads are going to stay with the babies.'\" The Orion plan calls for women, as in the rest of the Empire, to rule and run the planet. Men are to be relegated to cleaning house and caring for the children. That so many men are going along with it shows the strength of the Orion DNA commands. As stated elsewhere, women do NOT want equality, they want control. The 'equality' line was just to get their foot in the door. These are Orion DNA commands which always work on low through early advanced incarnations. The spirit is not strong enough to override these commands until having passed the early advanced stages. Those who are very advanced spiritually do not allow the Orion commands to control them. Minions are totally body controlled and will obey. If the full Orion Wild Card gets played, those who are Final Incarnations and VERY advanced will not play those control games. Finals are out of here anyway. The very advanced will rebel and, at the very least, not participate on an individual level. 2012 is End Game, so there is not much time left either way no matter what series of Wild Cards are played.

I saw one man express his 'curiosities' about gay sex and the interviewer said, \"If you have sex with another man, you're gay. You can only be gay or heterosexual.\" This is NOT true, but it sticks with the Game's polarity of one or the other with no in-between. This goes along with self-proclaimed Emperor of Earth, George Bush jr's statement of,'you are either with us or against us'. No middle road is allowed. As I've stated in earlier M5 materials, balance is required in everything. The same is true for sexuality. The (erroneous) claim that only 10% of the population is gay/lesbian would mean that only 10% of the population is het. Where does that leave the other 80%? Bisexual. If TRUE statistics were used, more than 10% of the population is gay/lesbian and more than 10% is het, although the dominant orientation IS bisexual. This is something the Game does NOT want to be known. I've met FAR more married/married-with-kids men who want same gender sex than I've met totally gay men. Since nature is overwhelmingly bisexual, minions will also fall into this category. With Higher Self incarnations, it will depend on the Advancement of the spirit and shim's control over the physical and its alien DNA commands to be het (OBEY THE EMPIRE) and breed. There is also the crumbling nature of the DNA commands which is one reason the Orion Empire wants to remake Earther humans. I've mentioned the electrical/chemical incompatibilities with het sex, but while they act to keep the spirit from control of the physical, these electrical/chemical impulses actually reinforce the alien DNA commands. Bisexuality, in Higher Self incarnates on Earth, comes about as the spirit begins to exert some will over the body. They tend to be very torn over the issue and VERY secretive about their affairs with FEAR as the root of secretive behaviors DUE TO THE DNA COMMANDS STRAINING FOR THE SPIRIT TO OBEY THE EMPIRE VIA THE PHYSICAL BODY. As the bisexual returns to het sex, the DNA commands are reinforced and the attempt to subdue the developing spirit is increased by FEAR of not conforming. This fear is what they trust you will obey to keep you in line. I've talked to a number of secret bisexuals about their desires and they have all kinds of pseudo logic to rationalize all their behaviors. They really DON'T want to talk about it and this is due to their not being Advanced enough to handle it. They must move at their own pace. Having same gender sex will strengthen the spirit OVER the body's DNA commands. This is why, if advancing enough, they ALWAYS come back or look for more. It was a spiritual high that cannot be duplicated in het sex. Bisexuality is the bridge to higher development. Denial of bisexual urges, when swamped in the fog of alien induced heterosexuality, indicates physical dominance of the spirit. Bisexual activities indicate a progressing spirit (in Earther Higher Selves) as the spirit BEGINS to exert control over the alien DNA commands. This DOES happen in mid-levels BEFORE the spirit is really ready for Advanced spirituality. It will assist the developing spirit into entering Advanced levels in other incarnations.

The Law of Attraction says Like Attracts Like. Split genders exist, in reality, only on the 3rd density. The ILLUSION of genders exists on the 4th density (astral) because the spirits are clinging to their 3rd density characters and have created the illusion of having gender on the astral. As stated in Matrix 5, when the astral inhabiting incarnation realizes that shim is no longer the gender that shim was on in 3rd density, the incarnation drops the false gender appearance, reverts to shim’s natural state and moves on, LEAVING THE ASTRAL. While bisexuality is the ‘balance’ (NOT Balance in the spiritual sense) between gay and het orientations, it is NOT the Way of the universe. For it to be the Way, separate genders would have to exist up through all the densities. They do not. Genders are, as stated several times before, a 3rd density phenomena. The gay/lesbian lifestyle is the only pure reflection of the Law of Attraction in 3rd density. However, since 3rd density is a training ground/learning experience, the incarnations (both simultaneous and sequential) must come to their own realizations of this and at their own pace. Progressive sexual orientations will be learned FAR quicker in the simultaneous path of Earther Higher Self incarnations than in the eternally slower sequential path. One example - the Errans of the Taygeta system of the Pleiadies (Meier's contacts) are FAR behind in this area - so far behind Earther Higher Self incarnations that their men do not dance for fear of \"appearing homosexual\". There, unfortunately, is a lot of that attitude among the sequential incarnates. It is the Law of Attraction that pulls Earther incarnates into bisexuality and causes the alien DNA commands to panic. The Universal Laws, being universal, will eventually call all incarnates into awareness AS INTENDED. The Universal Laws are a major undercurrent in the Game that the Game does not want any attention drawn to. The Game would like everyone to beLIEve it is the alpha/omega. This is part of the Game's deceptions. The loophole in the Game is allowing the Matrix 5 information to be distributed to those who wish to know how to escape (NOT fight) the Game. Even if you aren't ready for all the information that you read in the Matrix 5 materials, it is still now part of your Higher Selfs informational base and can be accessed by other significant incarnations you have, especially your Final Incarnation wherever shim may be in time. I can't overstate this importance nor the importance of the escape hatch from the Game, but it is something you'll have to discover for yourself. Since bisexuality has the Law of Attraction as its basis, the Game increases its panic by trying to deny the existence of bisexuality. Hence you get the dopey comment, 'You're either gay or straight\". This is a lie. YOU (the true YOU) are all homosexual because ALL spirits are both genders in one. You have not been aware of this due to the Game, alien DNA and control devices (religion, governments, etc).

However YOU have to make your own decisions at the pace you are able to. Just as you have to overcome polarity in many facets to progress, you will have to come to an awareness of genders/ sexuality, as these involve creative abilities, and move beyond the extreme limits of 3rd density to realize your TRUE potential. If you cannot handle this information at this time, go back to what you are able to handle. As I’ve said before, Matrix 5 information is written for Final, Dominant and Very Advanced incarnations only. No matter where , you are (or are not) today, you WILL.be able to overcome the limitations/illusions the Game has spun around you. There is a lot for you all to consider in these bisexual segments. Bisexuality & Minions The Nature Spirit incarnations on Earth are bisexual in almost all cases. The Planetary Spirit is learning/progressing through incarnations in animal, insect and plant bodies. As I've said in earlier Matrix 5 materials, the Path for the Planetary Spirit is significantly different than that of Earther Higher Selves. Unlike Earther human bodies, the animal kingdom, in almost all cases, is unfettered by alien sexual DNA command structures. This allows them to progress as they need. There have been and still are creatures/insects/plants on Earth that are the result of genetic experiments. These experiments were alien and Atlantean in origin. In a few instances, Orion scientists implanted the DNA commands for heterosexuality as tests for implanting them in Earther humans. The number of species where this happened was VERY small and most no longer exist on Earth today. The way to spot these that remain is to see which animals remain monogamous once mated. The Planetary Spirit does not have any ‘sexual hang-ups’ so common in DNA commands in humans. Sex is done for pleasure and for breeding, not for life-mating, in almost all cases. The sex is almost always bisexual with an 'if it feels good, do it' attitude. When the cycle is completed for the Earth Planetary Spirit, just as for Higher Selves, genders no longer exist and all are both genders in one, according to the Universal Laws. Bisexuality is the standard among 3rd density beings, both Planetary Spirit and Higher Self incarnates, in Very Advanced stages. Heterosexuality will only inhibit progression. Heterosexuality is only useful in procreation, a function that is no longer valid/necessary on Earth today. In AWAKENED Final Incarnations of Higher Selves, due to the very nature of being Awakened, you will not find any heterosexuals and you will find most are gay/lesbian as the Universal Laws apply more and more with spiritual growth, and the desire is to live according to these Laws. It is not a burden. It is done willingly and eagerly. The Awakened Final Incarnation spirit, in control of most of the physical, will override the alien DNA commands and leave that useless baggage behind. Even if the Unawakened Final Incarnation was heterosexual, once the Awakening process begins, bisexuality will begin as 'curiosity'. Of course this strikes a chord of fear in those who are body conti'olled. BUT this material is not written for those trapped in the heterosexual swamp. This is one of the greatest fears of the body and the Orion Empire, since it is connected with you finding out who you really are, casting off the shackles of the Game & alien DNA commands and reverting to your true nature.

This concludes the 3 part bisexual commentary that I am sharing with Matrix 5 readers. Consider what you have read. When it is YOUR time, you WILL understand with an \"ah-ha\" of awakening. Asexuality: Living In Denial (Special Gold Edition Segment) There are the 3 forms of sexuality in 3rd density: heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual. Each is a different experience with heterosexuality being the low end, common and least like the higher realms. Homosexuality is the high end and most like the higher realms. Then there is a state known as 'asexual'. This is where one professes to have ‘no sexual inclinations’. This state is not based on any medical or age reason, but just reflects someone who claims to not to want to engage in sex. This is a phase of denial between heterosexuality and the other more advanced stages of sexuality. This is body ID induced and stems from the person not obeying their DNA commands, but not yet strong enough to act out non-heterosexual inclinations. This stalemate usually results in asexuality or a standoff between the body ID and the spirit in transition. Many religious orders claim celibacy. This is mostly for public, Lightsider impressions because behind closed doors, all types of activity can and do occur. To be fair, though, there is a small percentage of those orders who really do practice celibacy. Celibacy and asexuality are twins of the same family. Religions love using these twins to get people to deny sexuality. Denying sexuality will limit your spiritual growth, not increase it as some Eastern religions teach. But, as I've said before, religions are alien constructs to mislead simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves. Sexuality is an important key in unlocking who you really are. The sequential, knowing that this is so, AND wanting to delay the inevitable on Earth, placed the heterosexual short circuits in Earther human bodies so that het sex would be a body pleasure and not a spiritual experience, but instead a spiritual shortening out. This has been covered in earlier Matrix 5 segments. If the person no longer desires to pursue het sex, due to spiritual advancing, but is not to the stage where they can admit that they want to advance to higher sexually, a denial of sex is announced when it comes to doing it with another person. Wrapping themselves in a false sense of not needing sex, they pretend that they’ve risen above such desires. This is another trap laid by the sequentials. This is also why, due to religion, that sex is constantly referred to as \"dirty\" and hence 'beneath' you. Fortunately, few spend much time in this dead end. It rarely lasts more than one incarnation. The spirit realizes that shim needs the intimate companionship of like and moves next into that direction. This may be by baby steps with long periods of denial and retreat into asexuality in between, but the journey has begun. This journey will take you far from the asexual denial phase and into areas you MUST experience and do so eagerly/willingly in order to proceed to the higher densities. You may say, 'not me' now because that's where you are. The vibrations of change will assist you in overcoming the body ID and alien restrictions. You will mark those incarnations as very fortunate within your Higher Self.

The Breakdown of the Orion DNA Sexual Component On March 14, 2001, Reuters featured an article, “More Americans Having Gay Sex”, which showed the increasing deterioration of the artificial induced, heterosexual orientation. Heterosexuality was forced on newly split Ancient Earthers as a way to keep Earthers from discovering their Higher Selves. As I've said in earlier writings, in gay/lesbian bodies, the Orion DNA command is shorted out in regard to sexuality. The article shows that it is deteriorating in those still with the body identification of heterosexual, which is contrary to the First Law of the Universe. The numbers given in the article are VERY conservative. The vast majority of men who have expressed interest in sex with me have been married men with children BUT they persist in calling themselves heterosexual...just curious. The conflict is with their body clashing with their spirit. The spirit longs to shine through, but needs experience and maturity to suppress the body's command structure in the sexual area. Rationalizing it as being 'just curious' would have them trick the body into 'it's just a phase'. Guilt usually kicks in during initial 'curious' experimentation. This guilt stems from Orion commands and concern of what others would think, which is also a sign of Orion control and spiritual immaturity. Guilt, as discussed earlier, is one of the polarity features that Light loves to club people into conforming with. As you spiritually mature, guilt becomes less of a factor until it is in the trash of former experience-generating events. What is interesting is that the more they have same gender sex, the more the guilt is overcome. That's because of the First Law of the Universe and Like strengthens Like. The chemical/electrical compatibility between the same gender is powerful and spirit- enhancing. THIS is one of the concerns that the Orion Empire and their lackeys on Earth (most religions, for example) don't want you to know. The gay/lesbian positive media and court rulings indicate a significant breakdown of the Orion sexual command. This is great for the First Law of the Universe. This is ONE of the reasons the Orion Empire is intending to solve the Earther human situation and ‘create a new human with stronger DNA commands to obey the Empire’. One of the other reasons is to subjugate the male completely. This is progressing, but not fast enough (!) for the Empire. Orion intends to make their presence overt with their newest queen. All this makes it imperative for FINAL incarnations to Awaken and other incarnations to process as much information as possible to their current incarnation. Gays, the Game & DNA Commands 0 One item in the Washington Post today (6/17/02) describes how hard-line Christians have formed an 'alliance' with muslims in attempting to block gay and abortion rights at the UN level.

WHY? These are just a few examples of the Game's manipulation and fear generation on the subject of homosexuality. Look deeper. They use 'fear of gays' as their banner, but why does the fear exist at all? Why should anyone care what any two consenting adults do - period? As I've said in other Matrix 5 segments, non-heterosexuals are a threat to the Game itself (when it garners POSITIVE views) because it leaves a wide opening for the spirit to POTENTIALLY Advance to the point of wanting to end shim's participation in the Game. The Game easily manipulates body-ruled individuals. The Game wants stagnation and no spiritual growth. The Game is only deceiving itself, as stagnation is not a realistic facet of the universe. Change is guaranteed. It is certain alien DNA commands to ‘breed’ and ‘be with the opposite gender’ that cause these fear based reactions. These commands exist primarily to stunt spiritual growth by placing you in an electrical/chemical status on one of the most important spiritual levels - sexuality. Recall what I've written about the effects on the spirit, when genders merge, in Matrix 5. The spirit WILL Advance despite these physical/DNA commands. That tells you something about the nature of the spirit and the Higher Self. Shim will free shimself from the DNA prisons formed by aliens and enforced through their lackies of religion and conformist societies. Hardliners are part of the Game’s machinery and are parts that eventually will be overcome by the Advancing spirit. The spirit grows DESPITE the alien deity of the bible and the koran, DESPITE the mindless (sheep/flock) who follow blindly and DESPITE countless other obstacles generated by the Game. The ancient Greek part of history, especially with Sparta, threw the Game into a tizzy with their culture. It was eventually suppressed, and later roundly condemned, by 'organized' (read Game-controlled) Christianity, then islam. However, no matter what these agents of the Game did, homosexuality continued and, in some instances, thrived. Why? Part of this is due to Earther Higher Selves being on the simultaneous incarnational Path. When you exist in old Greece, the vibrations/experiences you have are stored in your Higher Self and DO influence other of your incarnations to varying degrees. Yes, you DO have incarnations where the body rules the spirit (low and mid levels). You, in these incarnations, DO live for/enforce the Game and its rules (part of your experiences AND you ALWAYS learn the Dark parts first). BUT you also DO grow and eventually override the body. This first occurs in seemingly insignificant areas. These areas, ignored by the alien DNA commands, are the toeholds you need to build up more Advancement. The effect of these first spiritual usurpations creates a slow (at first), snowballing effect on your incarnational path that ripples through your developing incarnations.

All Rights Reserved. has developed enough, the spirit begins to challenge the Game in areas that the Game says are 'off limits'. Those who pander to the Game are still under body control. Part of your mission, within your incarnations, is to overcome numerous aspects of Game controls. Sexual orientation IS one of the major areas. There are NO heterosexuals in higher densities. It is unnatural. Shadows of them exist in the astral, but they are only illusions based on 3rd density experiences. While you DO have gay/lesbian incarnations at various spiritual levels - ALL Earther Higher Selves do - what is necessary is that the bands of heterosexuality be broken. This is also done at YOUR time and with specific incarnations set by YOUR Higher Self to be victorious over the alien DNA commands. The Very Advanced stages of incarnation will be found to be gay and bisexual (even if some are closeted). I refer you to the 3 segments I wrote on bisexuality for more information. If someone whines, \"I gotta have (the opposite gender)\", that is PURE body control, anti­ spirit and anti-Law of Attraction. They haven't progressed enough yet. These people are not yet able to'understand this reaction is due to the strength of the DNA commands. The 'gotta have' comes from the body sensing a weakening of control. First time incarnations in a gay/lesbian/bi physical can have a same gender experience, then run back to the Game wrapped in guilt. THAT is built in. It is by engaging in continued same gender contacts that the spirit is strengthened to override these alien DNA commands. It DOES happen. Lots of airy-fairy Lightsiders wallow in heterosexuality and the illusions the Game spins around it. They don't yet realize that by doing so, they reinforce the spiritual growth inhibitors that come with heterosexual couplings. If they use tired, old (read body ID), low & mid level phrases like: 'proud father/husband', 'devoted mother/wife', etc (and, boy, can I make a list of these), they are definitely NOT ready for Matrix 5 materials. They find it a shock to their DNA command systems and these systems react in force to such direct shocks as I've placed in Matrix 5. The base fear of the rabid Christians and their muslim 'allies' (yeah, allies like Hitler & Stalin) is stimulated by observing the spirit unfettered by the body. <GASP> They don't obey...they don't conform...and they threatened the stagnation we desire - hence the reactions they display towards gay issues. Too late, Game players. The gay card was played ORIGINALLY as a divisive measure in the ongoing 'divided they fall' campaign of another facet of the Game (Orion Empire/Dark side). They underestimated the reactions of Earther Higher Selves. Today isn't the Dark Ages, which are the really 'good old days' to them. They released the genie from the bottle and it's too late to put it back. Hence you have people, like the dictator Bush in the White House, who obeying his alien mistress, gives homophobia support and the hardline Christians false hope. June is 'Gay Pride' month. Gays have much to be proud of, primarily in overriding one of the MAJOR DNA commands despite terrible pressure/persecutions from various arms of the Game. Hets are constantly seeking to reinforce their unnatural primacy via film, ads, tv, music, etc. Hets are ALWAYS showing off their 'private business'. The Game doesn't want you to concentrate on gays in a POSITIVE light. As the Game reaches its climax in these last days, the failure of it to succeed in holding back Earther Higher Selves is VERY obvious to those who KNOW and are in touch with THEIR Higher Selves.

All Rights Reserved. 'Coming Out' and The Game The phrase 'Coming Out' is connected today with a gay or lesbian revealing their orientation and lifestyle to family and friends. This is one way the Higher Self, through that incarnation, demonstrates that shim is breaking an experiential cycle and striking out as part of the process of escaping from the Game. On my way home from work yesterday, I listened to the talk radio where Coming Out was being discussed. Whenever matters on sexual orientation, that contradict the Game, are in view, the body's DNA commands move into overdrive. I heard such stupid comments as 'maybe it’s only a phase' and 'maybe they haven't met the 'right' person'. Of course by 'right' they mean opposite gender. Why is it you don't hear 'maybe it's only a phase' in regard to someone moving into het orientations? The reason is the gay/lesbian/bisexual lifestyles are spirit (as in Law of the Universe) oriented, while the het lifestyle is body/alien DNA command oriented. The radio host, when told by a mother how her 25 year old son Came Out to the family, asked if the son is effeminate. No, said the mother, he is sports oriented which made the host even more nervous. Did he ever date? Yes, said the mother, but my son found no attraction with the girls he dated. <GASP> as more panic sets in. This 25 year old is not adhering to the 'rules'. Does he have a father? Yes. How is his father taking it? He supports and loves his son even though it isn't the lifestyle he would have wished for him. All this fear and nervousness! Why? The 25 year old has broken an experiential loop AND has cause his parental incarnations to examine issues that are necessary for them to view at this time. This 25 year old's courageous step has rippling effects throughout his family, friends and those who hear his mother's story. THAT shakes the Game up. The Game doesn't like it when people break experiential loops, especially on this magnitude, and disobey conformity standards. That the son is normal, athletic and self-confident demonstrates a Higher Self incarnate moving into more Advanced stages and subduing the body’s DNA commands. Those people who support him are going through their own changes on their own paths. 'Normal' also means what is normal for you. The Game seeks to warp normality into the word 'conformity', so a red flag should go up when you hear the word 'normal' being used as a weapon of the Game. If any of you are nervous, uncomfortable or otherwise put off by reading segments like this one or any other of the sexual themed segments, you have internal issues. That you are reading them here shows that YOUR Higher Self wants you to be exposed to these ideas to stimulate your own Advancements out of the Game. Heterosexual orientation is the Game. You will move beyond that to escape the Game but it doesn't necessarily mean that you will do so in this incarnation. It takes many incarnations to break free and the cycle ends with the Final Incarnation. However, your exposure to this material will assist your Higher Selfs other incarnations Advanced enough to handle this material, even if your current incarnation is limited. The process involved with Coming Out is a major step for an incarnation, more so if the incarnation is not perceived as gay or lesbian. When everyone seems to consider someone gay, whether they have admitted it or not, is usually due to the male being effeminate or the female being masculine. When the person passes as an average type of guy/girl and then announces they are gay/lesbian, THAT causes the shock to others. They could pass off the effeminate male or butch female as other than standard, but when one of 'them' reveals their truth, the group wonders how many more are there and those playing the Game feel threatened which is totally fear based due to DNA commands.

Resistance to Coming Out shows a body's DNA commands are on alert to the spirit exercising control over the body in a way stronger than sneaking around having same gender sex in the shadows. The Higher Self celebrates this event in shim's progression as it heralds the move toward ending shim's participation in the Game. As with all other experiences and levels, you will find Earther Higher Self incarnates involved in all sides of issues for the experience. Those on the Game side of the issues will eventually progress to the Higher Self side of them. Observe, learn and Advance. The Law of Attraction The First Law of Creation is the Law of Attraction (Reference: Handbook for the New Paradigm ). \"Simply stated, like attracts like\". This law has been perverted on 3rd density Earth to ‘opposites attract’. This is artificial and of the body. This is also a major force in the Game. This was introduced by Orion & Sirian Empires' genetic scientists who wanted to absorb Earth into the Empire. It was necessary to mutate the ancient Earth human into two genders and force the newly created genders to bring their warring, incompatible selves together. I have covered this previously. If the spirit is advanced enough (always the Final Incarnation), it will extend this law to the physical it occupies. In bodies where the DNA commands of sexuality are shorted out, these are gay and lesbian incarnations. The spirits in these bodies vary widely in maturity and, unfortunately, they rarely understand this gift. This shorting out is increasing and one reason why the Orions are considering destruction of current human population and recreated them with stronger DNA commands. Pre-invasion Native American tribes did understand. This was a threat to the Game and was dealt with by the evil Christians and their armies. An incarnation having a heterosexual experience can mature enough to overcome the DNA command. These could even have been experiencing the curse of ‘marriage’ when they realize they no longer can participate in this artificial, forced state. When this occurs, the watchdogs of Game play howl and berate the person for daring to alter Game rules and try to get the body to exert control over the spirit again. This fire can be part of the spirit's refining when it sees the Game and its players for the control freaks they are. Never forget, as above, so below - but use the Higher Density model instead of the Orion model. As long as you adhere to the Orion 'opposites attract’, you will reincarnate as ‘you are your body’. Once you adhere to the Creation ’like attracts like’, be glad as your reincarnational cycle in nearing its end and you are less of a Game player. This First Law shows its potential in either all female or all male energy raising circles. The energies raised within far exceed those of mixed gender groups. This is due to mixed genders not understanding (or caring to understand) the First Law and catering to the Orion mutation of the law. Remember, they are their body. When opposite genders come together, especially sexually, there is a shorting out of all potential except for Orion-approved breeding. This is also part of the Orion plan to keep the real you subjugated to the physical. Remember breed and produce are the 2 prime Orion directives.

While much more can be said about this, I've given enough for Final Incarnations to expand on. The spirit seeks the perfection it had in ancient Earth when there were no genders. Consider ’like attracts like’ is the First Law of Creation. Spend some time thinking of all its implications and discover more of who you really are and are not. Posturing Posturing, one of the prime functions of the physical due to the DNA tampering by the alien genetic scientists. Way back when the meddlers began tampering with DNA, AFTER splitting Earth humans into genders, they plugged in the urge to reproduce in both genders. Before gender splitting, there was no compulsion to reproduce and the population was kept at a comfortable minimum. Also there was no such bondage as ‘marriage’, but that ideal reality is long gone. The breeding urge was placed into humans to supply workers for the masters and as a food supply. They tied this breeding urge with sexual pleasures and the rest, unfortunately, is history. Posturing, the attempts at trying to lure the opposite gender , have become an art in the modern times. Posturing has been done in various ways by both genders. At first, females did not do what they know in current times. They would use talents (cooking, field work, etc - read practicality) to lure a male. Temple prostitutes were the first to paint themselves up for the average citizen (the royals are another story). In ancient Rome, a prostitute advertised by coloring her hair blonde. If you see a blonde in Ancient Rome, you KNOW what she does for a living. This spread from temple prostitutes to brothels and street whores. As the average female saw how this attracted males, they began to adapt to whore regalia to try and keep the male at home (remember the female urge to hoard her energy source and control the male in her way). By painting lips, etc, the average female in the then Known World started to bring the art of posturing to the science it is today. However, the core of ALL posturing is breeding. This is NOT beauty, it’s artificial and females excel at being artificial today, at least the vast majority of them do. It is not who they are, but what they want you to believe they are, which is false. Males didn't need this kind of posturing, but they did it by being a leader, a military hero, or someone else who the limelight shined on. The natural male power aura of life became more valuable for the female. The strongest, the best looking, the artist, the poet all drew females to their attention. Today, it's the athlete or the holder of power (financial, entertainment, political) that serves to posture them to the females. This is when they can judge the females throwing themselves at his energy, who is likely to be the best breeder. It all goes back to the curse of breeding. However this DNA command to breed is so strong that the vast majority continue to posture even after marriage, after breeding and even when older. Society, the overseer for the masters, keeps drilling the artificial, 'you are your body' theme to keep you in posturing stance. Look young, plastic surgery, conform to physical standards...anything to keep you concerned with the physical rather than WHO you really are. The breeding command has so suppressed and warped the spirit (unless quite mature), that they continue to obey the opposite gender command and will live with the opposite gender even if children are not bred nor desired. Why? Due to a flaw in the breeding command structure of the DNA. This could be a rather extensive look at why they 'have' to be with the opposite gender, but I prefer being briefer at this time.

Gay men and lesbians, even though their DNA has lost the commands to be with the opposite gender, still have the posturing commands due to their genetic history where it's been so inbred. Most gay men, so it seems, have severely limited physical/superficial structures - youth oriented, how one dresses, paranoid with weight consciousness to the point of needing a shrink (to name some). In the TV show Will & Grace, Jack rightfully complains about the treatment he got in grade school for being gay and how he was verbally abused. Yet, this same Jack will turn around and abuse others for how they dress, if their weight is not within his narrow standards, what they enjoy doing.if different from him, etc. The victim has become the abuser. He wants unconditional acceptance, but is unwilling to reciprocate. This is a TYPICAL gay reaction. When hearing about somebody they may be interested in, what do they ask? How old is he? How is he built? And other similar questions, the hell with who he is, they're only interested in the physical. Then you hear them moan, will I ever find love? Well, Miss Thing, you're not looking for love, you're shopping for a side of meat. This is not, fortunately, observed by ALL gays, but a rather large, LOUD segment of the gay population. Lesbians, on the other hand, are not as superficial, to their credit. They look more for the internal woman, not the outer, which is secondary in most cases. You will find both gays and lesbians, although a minority, ‘wanting to have kids’. That’s the breeding desire. So, even if the section commanding opposite gender sex has been neutralized, there are sub­ commands in the DNA structure that may still be operational. ALL of these commands come from the meddlers and are artificial to true, ancient Earth humans. Instead of developing Lheir minds and spirits, discovering who they really are and why they have chosen to be here, religion, government, advertisers and those who have bought into that artificial reality continually bombard the rest of the populace to be your body and keep it within standards set. Paint your face, dye your hair, keep your weight to our standards, wear what we approve of, cosmetic surgery, be seen with the 'right' crowd, eat what we say, drink what we say, have this medical test, take these drugs, smoke these ciggy butts, don't have a good time unless it's doing what we want you to...you only have one life. LIES! You only have one life as your current incarnation, but you have hundreds and hundreds of lives. It doesn't matter if you're short, tall, skinny, fat, bald, grey, wrinkled, average looking or whatever. What DOES matter is are you developing your mind? Are you true to yourself or to others? Do you live for THEM or for you? It doesn’t matter if you look like the Wicked Witch of the West or are average or less in looks. It's the inner you, the REAL you that counts. Don't be side-tracked into the \"I'm only human\" dead end path. When someone tells me \"I'm only human\", I respond, \"Too bad, I'm not\". Posturing is just part of the problem, but it is a big part. People do not want to explore the why's of it. Geez, no, they may have to wake up and take responsibility for themselves. Why do you \"HAVE\" to be with the opposite gender? Why do you \"HAVE\" to conform to dress standards? Why do you \"HAVE\" to keep a weight of such and such pounds? Why do you \"HAVE\" to be so preoccupied with doctors and what they say (that's another power giving away topic for another time)? Understand posturing for what it is and why it's there and it is unnatural to your true nature. Be true to yourself - one of the keys to spiraling up and out.

All Rights Reserved. Observations: Breaking the Experiential Loop We all have them - experiences that keep repeating themselves with different players. The most common seems to be the Liz Taylor/Donny Trump thing of 'marriage of the year' club membership. As I’ve written, opposite gender couplings are contrary to the First Law of the Universe (Like attracts Like). The alien genetic scientists know that, so they built in heavy DNA commands to override the spirit. So you have internal conflicts between \"I want to be with my own kind\" (men prefer hanging with other men and women prefer hanging around with other women) and the false physical command to be with the opposite gender. This causes many, many problems. The chemical/electrical shorts that occur when opposite genders experience physical contact (of ANY kind) will enhance the DNA command structures and work against the spirit. It's only through HUNDREDS of such incarnations that the spirit learns and, eventually near the end of the 3 rd density experience, overcomes this massive flaw. You see/hear this daily with marriages changing like the changing of oil in a car. They are unsettled with being together and get the 'itch' to look for someone they don't realize. Although this is PARTIALLY due to a sub-command in the DNA structure to breed as much as possible AND it does exist in all sexual orientations, it is part of the plan of the alien scientists of WAY back. I know SO many people who are miserable living with the opposite gender, but stay together for such artificial reasons as finances, children or just lack of faith in self. These are all major victims and 'oh poor me's’. This is also part of the Mid-level through mid- Advanced level trials. I've always said to people that I understand why you got married, but when you realized it didn't work, why did you repeat the mistake? Of course I KNOW the answer, but I wanted to make them think. This is one of those experiential loops the spirit is ‘doomed’ to keep repeating until shim CONSCIOUSLY recognizes it and breaks it over the protest of the alien DNA commands. \"You just don’t understand\" they say, BUT I do. It is THEY who don't understand yet as they are not ready to face what is. Eventually they will, but until then they will remain in these loops. Other types of loops would include situations of any sort that keep coming back into your life. When you notice something like this happening, examine each of the players and see what they all had in common. THAT'S where you will find the reason for the loop in your life. Here's one of mine from this incarnation: I had offered to individually train 4 different men. They all had varying degrees of excellent psychic ability, but one after the other, they declined. I looked at what each had in common and it was all centered around the damned DNA command 'to be with the opposite gender and their females’ ALWAYS got in the way. Once I recognized the problem, I committed myself never to offer to train any man who must have the opposite gender. They are where they are, BUT they are not yet ready for someone like me. That's ok, as it's their path, but I can't have such a disruptive influence like some vindictive bitch’s interference with training. They ALWAYS want to know everything that's going on and decide what he can or can't do. They want to be \"we's\" and I do not do \"we's\".

Look at loops in YOUR life. What common, ‘negative’ thread do you find in each example. Once you've identified it, you can make adjustments to it and the loop will be broken. Shorting Out By DNA Command The spirits of both genders are male and female perfectly blended into one energy being. The Orion genetic scientists understand this as well as the immaturity/innocence of incarnating spirits. It took several experiments before they came up with the current human models, and even here they've tweaked it on occasion throughout history. What they never wanted to happen is for the spirit to know who it is while in the physical for it would be uncontrollable by the Empire if allowed to mature past a certain point. Dominant and Final Incarnations would be completely independent. Not only is the false law of opposites attracting part of the DNA command structure, but also is a provision to enhance the blocking of spiritual development, like an electrical short, when the genders mate. Ancient, newly created human beings had to be forced to mate, so put off were they by each other. To be safe, a spiritual shortage, enhanced by the female's succubistic ability and urge to reproduce and the males 'I am my body' desire for a dynasty, was worked into the DNA commands. The Empire needs bodies\\ The more the male had sex, the more it wanted sex AND it was for breeding purposes. In more modern times, unless mormon, catholic or 3rd world, the desire is not so much for a dynasty in many cases (spirits are maturing, but not mature enough to see through the Game), but for the DNA command 'to be with the opposite gender' even if totally incompatible. They don't realize they were designed to be incompatible on purpose - to keep them so fighting amongst themselves that they'd find it harder to discover ivho they are. So the sham of marriage is followed by multiple divorces, palimonies, crisis, and violence, all because the body is in control of the spirit to satisfy the insatiable desire of the Orion Empire for workers and food. The short is electrical and chemical in nature, however it’s like a poisonous plant - pretty to look at, but deadly if touched. We ALL must go through the Game and these experiences, and we ALL will eventually come to an understanding of the Game and withdraw when spiritually mature enough. A Few Brief Comparisons: DNA Commands vs. Higher Self Overrides Those Governed By Orion DNA Commands: Defend/cater to the whims of and defer to the female even at the cost of what or who is right. Reproduce and breed regardless of one’s ability to properly care for offspring. An inherent “need’ exists to expand the population. Heterosexuality is for breeding purposes, to keep the genders in conflict, and to sustain female domination whether covertly or overtly. Conform/submit to deity and authority figures including priesthoods. Believes in only “One path” to development. External salvation oriented. Use whatever means to enforce conformity and standards. Believes You are your body” (I'm only human) and the “one life to live” lie. All life is “sacred”, but kills its own kind. Anti-abortion. A need for someone to “carry on the family line”. Those Governed Bv Higher Self Overrides: Recognition of Orion commands. Treats no one as gender but by their merits and desire to grow. Never defers to any gender because of gender.

Sees heterosexuality for the perversion of the Spirit that it is, but also recognizes it as part of the Game/experience for lesser advanced incarnates.

Never forces their will on anyone. Defend only if attacked. Understands of the notion of “external salvation” as a lie. Sees the body as a vehicle for spirit - nothing more. Pro-choice. Life begins at first breath. Realizes that other races use humans for various purposes. Genealogy is meaningless. Sex and The Spirit The main purpose of sex on Earth is to procreate, bring more workers and food in for the Empire. In centuries past, this was the only way sex was approved. For the male, it didn't need to be a long affair, but just the express road: to impregnate the female. This was and is unsatisfying for the female as sex with a male was the prime way to feed off his powerful energy and recharge her batteries. Hence, there were many bitter females being cut off long before reaching maximum charge. Both reflect sex where the body is in control, not the spirit. This also includes the free and easy approach most gays have to sex. With the men, it's sex for sex first, not for an emotional tie. With an immature spirit, they can go through the vocalizing of 'I want true love', but tend to fall back into a body-defined needs for sex and physical orientation above the desires of the spirit. Lesbians are more eager to settle down with another woman and follow through far more reliably than most gay men. When the spirit exerts more control over the physical, a more tender nature expresses itself. It's no longer the quickie (that's always the body speaking) AND, the more Advanced spiritually, the less likely it will be with the opposite gender exclusively. Not only that, but also sex becomes so controlled by a Very Advanced spirit that it will be put off by the idea of carousing ‘just for sex alone’ without an emotional tie. Spirit controlled bodies desire closeness with other spirit controlled bodies (Like Attracts Like). Obviously there are WIDE variations in control of spirit over body. We ALL must go through them to get to spirit control. Sex for sex alone with another person is viewed as empty, purposeless and very unsatisfying. Sex involving spirit to spirit is deep, energy exchanging and part of the growth process for both spirits. It enhances the creative aspect. Final Incarnations, once Awakened to who they are, will not have children as they realize, this as a major drain on their creative nature. Refer to my other comments on this in other sections in Matrix 5. Final Incarnations, even if occupying different genders, will realize that Like Attracts Like and the dangers to the spirit so evolved by opposite-gender sex. This is not likely to be acknowledged by anyone who is NOT in their Final Incarnation, and those are very rare compared to the number of incarnated bodies today.

It won't do any good to caution, though, because all of you think you're ready for everything until you're exposed to it. This message is for only a very few incarnates, but those few will understand & appreciate it. it is now time to release this.) In Matrix 5 I wrote about genders, sexual orientations, DNA controls and related. I took the information only to a certain level. It's time to expand portions of that. I will not repeat all the M5 material here, so I suggest, if you're interested, you re-read those topics. The DNA command to procreate like roaches is not of the spirit, but of the alien masters. The \"I am my family line\" is alien and of the body. The \"I have to have children to carry on my name/line\" is alien and of the body. Neither of these is true. I’ve been told several times, when asked why they breed, that they must 'expand the race' (alien command) or, if they know who I am, they tailor it to what they THINK I want to hear: 'to give other Higher Selves the opportunity to experience Earther existence'. The latter is common in low Advanced through mid Advanced levels. In the current time period (actually for the past few hundred years or so) this production line breeding has NOT been necessary for Higher Self incarnations, but rather to introduce and expand the minion populations arid cause the rapid deteriorations we are all so aware of on Earth today. The 'Higher Self incarnational experience opportunity' answer is a Light- sider twist to the basic alien command to attempt to keep the incarnation asleep. Also this encourages heterosexual couplings which, as I've explained in M5, causes a shorting out of the spirit's awakenings. This is part of the progression of the Earther Higher Self incarnational cycle and we ALL must advance beyond it. When you reach Awakened Final Incarnation, you will see more and more of The Game as it really is because you are to graduate from the scene. You could even have been a breeder BEFORE Awakening to your Final Incarnation state. When this happens, your Higher Self decided that shim wants shim's incarnation to be more aware of this facet of The Game. Gay/lesbian incarnations have been discussed. Now it's time for a deeper look into the heterosexual lifestyle. When a Higher Self chooses the Earther incarnational path, shim starts out with the spirit being driven by the body's desires (Low through Mid level incarnations). With experience, the spirit slowly and gradually exerts control over the line of bodies shim incarnates into. Low through Mid incarnational levels are rabidly heterosexual (EXCEPT in cases where the DNA commands in that area have failed and you have a gay or lesbian incarnation with an immature spirit.) These people are totally body dominated and when you toss in the control devices of religion, well you know what you get then. The heterosexual mechanism (perversion of the Law of Allowance) tricks the person into believing that they are ‘not whole within themselves’. They need 'my other half. Today it's 'soul mate' (New Age religions) that is the catch phrase because they believe they are not whole within themselves. These are alien implanted lies, BUT part of The Game. So the male 'has' to have a female ‘to be whole’ and vise versa. A mormon church leader stated that any man who wasn't married by age 25 is a 'danger to society'. Where's the danger? That he might be realizing his true nature? MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

I've asked several men about their stated 'need' for the opposite gender. I responded that it seems like you are looking for traits that you ‘don't have’, so you look for a traditional female to bring these into your life. This is because you don't realize that you have ALL these traits in you already but they are suppressed by the body and the Earther incarnational experience. You ARE whole within yourself and ‘the search’ for an external 'other half is in the same pot as the external deity and salvation myths. Bisexuality is the spirit beginning to exert shimself over the draconian alien DNA commands. Along with this, unfortunately, comes much guilt and fear. These are body generated due to your violation of DNA commands. If you don't respond to these self- imposed guilts/fears, and 'society' discovers your leanings, THEY will be eagerly obligated to shove controls at you. Bisexuality is a step that your incarnational path will take you on so that you can discover who you really are. Once you've reached the end of your incarnational Earther path, you no longer 'gotta have' the opposite gender and if you desire the same gender, the relationship is not like heterosexuals have or the delusionary, acceptance-craving marriages that many gays/lesbians want. When your spirit reaches a VERY Advanced level, shim will short out certain DNA commands BY WILL ALONE ('enough of that shit' attitude). Remember, as I have said, by the Final Incarnation you will have 85% control over the body and even higher control over significant areas of DNA commands. This is something you can't force. You MUST be who you are and where you are. However know it WILL happen to you, if not in this incarnation then in others. Your Higher Self benefits greatly from reading the Matrix 5 materials even if the incarnation reading them isn't ready for much of it. You cannot argue/convince others of 'how they should be'. They should be whatever they want to be. Law of Allowance! The complete individuality of each Higher Selfs incarnational path, here with Earther incarnated Higher Selves, is paramount. Conformity is an alien progressional fixture. Much more on this titled subject can be said, but this is enough for now. Masturbation Masturbation is a very valid form of sexual release. Taboos abound on this practice, especially in the major, organized religions. That in itself tells you something. Masturbation is one way the female can recharge herself USING HER OWN SPIRIT. This overcomes the \"I gotta have a man\" command. Lesbians, using mutual masturbation and other techniques, have done quite well with this. Remember the body is loaded with lies to stifle the spirit. As both genders have the same type of spirit, they contain both genders in one. Female masturbation will put her in the receptive state to allow the spirit to give what energy is needed without the male. Male masturbation is good to keep the system in working order. Those men who go long periods of years without sex or self-sex will have their systems go dormant. This can cause problems later in life. Consider all the bans on masturbation and think why...you aren't producing bodies for the Empire, you have the nerve to enjoy yourself and you just might discover that you don't need another person ‘to have sex with’. 175"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"A Comment on Balance I read something in Handbook III something about Balance being a “narrow, (hinting) bland, existence”, which is ‘why beings keep going to polarities’. This just isn't so. For anyone in or understanding Balance, it is the best of both polarities with the optimum of passion under control of the being, not the physical. Take cursing, for example, go into the background of why ‘fuck’ and ‘shit’, for example, are considered 'bad' words. There ARE no bad words. They are words of power with specific uses. The Light polarity, in its sanctimonious nature under control of religion, which is Dark polarity, has decided to limit verbal expression. ANY limit of verbal expression is controlling. So-called 'curse' words are not ‘bad’ at all. Most refer to sexual acts or human bodily functions, neither of which are dirty, they just are. However, to control people, certain types of Dark institutions (religion, society, etc) have decided that ‘sex is dirty’. Why is sex dirty? Because of the power therein WHEN understood and used correctly. It is a minor effect of sex to procreate. The major effect is instantaneous merging of spiritual essences between the 2 connected people. The meddlers do not want humans waking up to their full potential, so it is necessary to ban sex in all but procreative processes. That's why all the sexual related taboos - speech and action. An aware spirit can transmit much to an open, but limitedly aware person by sex. Knowing this, the sex act has been mutated into other non-spiritual methods - S&M, B&D and such. These involve pure lust and control which is physical and not spiritual. If you ‘are your body’, then that is so. These come from the Dark side. Super-orthodox Jews, placing a sheet between partners and sex only for procreating is a Light side plan. Both sides want sex to be either very limited or very lusty. Neither are into spiritual manifestations. Thus monogamy exists, also to control the expression of the spirit through sex. Females are the worst in this, but that is also connected to them hording their energy source (the male). Sex with spiritual bonding is NOT a control method. It's NOT the pseudo-soul mate garbage that you hear far too much today. Sex with spiritual interchange is NOT the 15 minute wham-bam goodbye. That's pure physical. True sexual/spiritual expression involves both the physical AND the spiritual. It is rare today. Today, people get married (a living bondage/curse) for control of the other, financial dependency, energy dependency, victimhood/power giveaways (he'll protect me or she'll take care of me) or similar. These are all polarity controls that limits spiritual growth. If you're gender-bound, you're physically limited for it's your physical that wants the opposite gender BECAUSE “they are the opposite gender”. The spirit wants to share with someone BECAUSE of who they are, and not what physical they are in. The more advanced spirits who are also in a DNA shorted out physical will recognize that to advance the most, they need the same type of physical as the opposite is either draining (female) or addictive (male). A female physical finds it far too easy (unless lesbian) to become dependent on the male's boundless energy. A male physical finds it far too easy (unless gay) to gain the approval of his 'peers' by appearing to be spreading the sperm and reproducing (ancient physical demand/primitive). The more advanced spirits do NOT reproduce, although they may have before waking up. The more advanced spirits realize the value of their energy and reserve it for other projects. Reproducing is a ‘low to later development’ incarnational function. Realizing ivhy not to reproduce is an ‘advanced to final’ incarnational mindset. We ALL have to go through all these stages, but you never go backward here...that carried too many traps, for it's harder to advance if you fall back.

Balance can curse when necessary, as Balance will not allow those who wish to control to limit by embarrassment or guilt (you know how Light loves to control with them). Fuck Light. Balance can show considerable compassion and care, despite Dark's me-only attitude. Fuck Dark. Balance is NOT interested in polarities’ opinions of itself. However you do have to experience both polarities to appreciate Balance. Balance is NOT a 3 rd density Earth prime function. It is far advanced, but then certain spirits have chosen to incarnate here from far higher densities to try and assist Earth at this time due to damaging energies threatening higher densities. It is in the interest of Balance to do what it can to assist Earth. So there! The Challenge: Undo Excessive Polarity Control I have mentioned that one of the purposes of Higher Self incarnations into Earther bodies, beside the main purpose of individual growth and experiences, is to initiate and assist in the deterioration of the Orion DNA command structure. There are beings of Balance who well know the polarities' desire to expand Dark/Light chaos into densities that have overcome polaric problems. The polarities will eventually fail. This is guaranteed. However, they will not give up quietly and will think there is a way to overcome the end of polaric existence to the very end. Robert Monroe talked a bit about the importance of the planet Earth in his second book. This dealt with the harvesting of \"loosh\" which is Monroe's term for a specific energy created by the Earth planetary spirit. Dark wishes to use this energy for its own purposes. When Orion perverted Ancient Earthers into genders and added DNA command structures contrary to the Laws of the Universe, those higher density beings saw what they were attempting to do for the long run. They also saw the opportunity for rapid growth by those Higher Selves who chose to incarnate on Earth and serve a higher purpose as well. Most Higher Selves declined the fast paced Earth Path and chose the slower, safer sequential incarnational path on other worlds. Those higher density beings knew there was only one way to cause a deterioration of the Orion DNA command structure. This was by active participation of the higher density beings in the incarnational process. As the Higher Self, with Earther incarnations, matures, the energy of the Higher Self becomes stronger. IF only those with Higher Selves incarnated on Earth, the command structure of the DNA would deteriorate more rapidly. Enter minion incarnations. The breed like roaches command is to ensure minion incarnations, which have no higher density being input. This is Dark's attempt to counter the Higher Selves. The 'defer to animals’ idea is minion oriented. When a Higher Self incarnates in any human Earther body, the vibration of shim's spirit itself begins the disruption of the Orion DNA command structure. The Higher Selves incarnate in all races and genders not only for the experience but also to begin the disruption of the command codes in as many Earther bodies as this disruption is passed on in the genes. There is nothing Dark can do about this except to increase minion population OR destroy all the physical bodies and re-engineer a new type of Earther being. The gay/lesbian sexual orientation, as mentioned before, is one where the ‘anti-First Law of the Universe DNA command’ was disrupted. Since Higher Selves' incarnations are simultaneous, the command structure disruption occurs from the earliest times after the Orion perversion on this planet. The disruption continues today.

Apparently that is the weakest link in the command. Polaric organizations, like religion, structured 'society' and governments, are arms of the Orion or rebel queens (both are equally bad for Earthers). They not only fight among themselves but against the Higher Selves. They know they are losing on Earth and intend to do something MAJOR to stop this. The major idea is to create a new being on Earth and try another approach to their planetary control. This will not happen. Keep 2012 in mind. It's not an artificial date and a LOT will happen between now and then. Consider what I've told you here and see if you can deduce more. The old Chinese curse is really a blessing: May you live in interesting times. The times are now. The Source and the Root of the Problem The DNA commands, instilled in Earth human bodies by the Orion Empire, cannot be undone by ‘throwing a switch’. They are in force to give the body dominance over the spirit. According to the Orions, ‘the only purpose of spirit is to animate the physical’ and this is to serve the Orion Empire and its queen. This is the Source of the problem and start of the Game. While this is the Source, the Root, formulated by the source, is the creation of genders which trap the spirit into believing 'I am my body'. The mutation delay, set by Orion, subjugates the life-giving male by the manipulative, controlling female, as it is in the Empire. The female gender has caused more problems and sadness than anything but religion. To be fair, if men had ignored their manipulations, it wouldn't have happened, but go back to the Source and the Root. In my own life, ALL interpersonal problems have been either directly because of females or men under the control of females. If the female isn't convinced she is in control and manipulating the male(s) in her life...and any other male(s) she chooses, she will make life miserable. Remember, diamonds are a girl's best friend - the costly and the inanimate. Everything else is strictly for her amusement. That this exists is one thing. That males allow themselves to be thusly deceived/controlled is their fault. I've already covered much of this in previous messages. As the spirit matures, it begins to exert itself over the physical. The physical does not give in easily. The prime lie of the physical is ‘you are not whole unless you live with the opposite gender’. This denies the true nature of the spirit, which is both male and female. However, it does show how the physical was divided by the Empire and how it seeks to return to its perfect state. This CANNOT occur by living with the opposite gender for the Empire also installed codes that cause conflict and the desire for females to rule in their physical. This body-oriented lack of wholeness attitude forces the body-controlled physicals to live with a non-compatible opposite gender and endure a life of conflict to appease the alien DNA commands. The succubistic nature of the female body harms the male and drains him of years, among other things. The male's ability to give life frustrates the female who can't and causes her to become a shrew if he won't obey or amuse her. As spirits mature, they feel restless with the status quo. Interests contrary to routine begin to peak their interests. Curiosities about other beliefs, psychic and occult mysteries and studies and radical, non-conformist thoughts are all from spirit trying to exert control over the physical. Sexual experimentations with the same gender are also of the spirit.

The spirit will eventually reach a state of maturity when they realize not only do they not need the opposite gender to live with, but also will act on it. Hence, women who leave husbands/boyfriends to be with another woman and men leaving wives/girlfriends to be with another man. This is increasing. Many times this occurs before the spirit is mature. This is when the DNA command is shorted out by genetics as well as usually when someone is born into a homosexual body. It takes courage and maturity for the spirit to control the body and break convention. You are still short of total spiritual control i/your physical still exerts the ’gotta be with the opposite gender' command that your spirit isn’t strong enough to override.

The X-Files series finale was tonight and it was excellent. The central theme was shown in the opening with 'End Game’ and 'December 22, 2012' as the date of End-Game. There are 2 items I want to touch on about the show. The date they use in the opening IS the date from the Mayan calendar. Near the end of the episode, it was revealed that, \"The Mayans were so frightened by the truth that they ended their calendar with that date\". The core truth, according to X-Files is that the date is the date of the final alien invasion of Earth and the end of Earther humans. This COULD be ONE possible end of End-Game. I say this because End-Game does NOT mean the end of the Game, but rather the end of Earther Higher Self participation IN the Game as Earther Higher Selves move on to the next level. This is a snowball type end that keeps getting more and more severe. The December 22, 2012 (winter solstice) is considered the LAST day. It is also said that if you're lucky, you will have departed the scene before then. Mulder also believes that the Game is controlled by a small group of people here on Earth. This is SO narrow-minded. The Game is controlled by something FAR greater than a group of people here, or the Orion Empire as a whole, for that matter. Mulder couldn't accept the nature of the Game at the level he is at. This brings up the second point I want to touch on. Mulder says, at the end, that he’s not giving up hope that we can ’save’ ourselves from the Event. This is the BODY talking. There is NO WAY that the real you, the incarnating spirit, will NOT be safe. The body, on the other hand, is only a vehicle for the spirit. You CANNOT save the body nor do you need to. It’s the BODY that is speaking when you hear this stuff. The BODY fears death because it is the end of the body forever. I have discussed this before in the M5 materials as well. I was asked if someone is caught in a nuclear explosion, is the spirit harmed in any way. The Higher Self is omnipotent and eternal. The Higher Self is also shim's extensions into shim's incarnational choices. IF there is a nuclear event (as when the US nuked Japan), the Higher Self withdraws the incarnating spirit extension less than a hair before the explosion. Knowing this, the bodies are dead a nano-second before the blast. Trust in your Higher Self, I keep saying. The REAL you will not be harmed.

All planetary problems have ended and the Goa'uld fear the Ahshinn Federation. The aliens have extended human incarnational life to 200 years. Then Carter, mid-level female, discovers she cannot become pregnant and that the life extending serums contain sterilization components. The Earther human race will end within 200 years. Crisis, crisis, panic!!! This is SO body ID'd. The 'I am my body' incarnates run around in panic. It's like watching a car (body) drive, in circles while the driver (spirit) sits and does nothing. The body FEARS death and the lack of breeding. These are alien DNA commands of prime directives to the body. The body is LOADED with fears, as I've said before. Yes, these are experiences but they are experiences to overcome. IF people were spirit oriented and the incarnation was in control of the body, the end of the Earther human existence would mean nothing since nothing is ever 'lost'. You may not totally grasp this until your Awakened Final Incarnation, possibly in VERY Advanced incarnations preceding the Final. You will learn there is NO weeping and wailing over the end of human life. Yes, the Game would like you to believe you are 'only human'. Yes, the aliens would like you to believe you are 'only human'. Yes, the rulers of Earth & their lackies would like you to believe you are 'only human'...BUT YOU ARE ANYTHING BUT HUMAN! This is a very Advanced concept for all to come to grips with, and you MUST do so in order to advance into higher than 4th density realms. The drive to push the fear of body death is SO strong at this time due to so many Higher Self incarnations progressing AND due to the End of the Game on 3rd density Earth almost here. If you cannot handle this message, push it to the side, as I've said with all of my M5 materials. You WILL be ready at some time in your incarnational path. I guarantee it.

Death of The Third Density Physical Vehicle Death Related Myths (Special Gold Edition Segment) \"I don't believe there's anything after death\": This is a popular myth among extreme body oriented people. The body and the body's life is everything to them, hence they will do anything they can to prolong the body's life. This is irregardless of the fact that their Higher Self chose the date/manner of death before the incarnation. The 'no life after death' person has subdued the spirit so that shim is along for the experience of spiritual denial. Each incarnation does have only one life as that incarnation. Once the body dies, that incarnation will never be alive in the physical again. This is the body’s greatest fear. Matrix 5 readers know that even though the body is dead and gone, ALL the experiences live on in that person's Higher Self. This makes these experiences immortal since they are contained in the real you. I have met a few of these 'nothing after death' people. You can't get anywhere with them, but listening to their body talk can be an interesting observation in body control. The 'nothing after death' deceptions originate with the sequential path beings. After all, it was the sequential aliens who installed those miserable DNA commands when they split Ancient Earthers into two genders. The Orion queen is fanatical about not dying. Cloning and life extension drugs abound in the Orion Empire because they do not want their part in the Game to end. This is a 3rd density addictive behavior and does retard spiritual growth. The symbol of the phoenix - physical rebirth - is Orion. It was also the symbol of the Chinese empress and others. One of the purposes for the existence of religion and its control on Earth was for thosef incarnates, who aren't fooled by the 'no life after death' mantra, is to keep a fear of god (alien personality masquerade) who will get you after death if you don't obey. They want to get you coming or going. This is to enhance the Game’s traps and dead ends forL simultaneous incarnates. When the 'no life beyond death' mode infects a simultaneous incarnation, it will only be for one or two incarnations FOR THE EXPERIENCE WITHOUT THE ADDICTION. This is because of the nature of simultaneous incarnating. We are experiencing a multitude of vastly different experiences at one 'time'. We will be long gone while the reptilians are still struggling with physical immortality. They were doing so when we chose the simultaneous path. We will have come and gone and they haven't even progressed at all. See how tediously slow the sequential path is! Body ID'd people love the phrases 'the gift of life' and 'all life is sacred'. These are Orion concepts, except they don't examine the intent when used by the Orion Empire. 'The gift of life\" is a reference to the Orion queen being able to clone and extend her life. The queen is mother. The queen IS the Empire. See how that is mirrored in Earther royalty? Royals talking in the 'we' mode, for example. The average Orion reptilian is not given this 'luxury'. 'All life is sacred' is an Orion concept as well since they consider that all life (under their jurisdiction) belongs to the. queen and is hers to use as she sees fit. Refer back to old England where all life on the king's preserve belonged to him, thus was, in a way, 'sacred' to 181"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"him. It also warns away other non-Orions that they risk the wrath of the queen if they mess with her 'sacred life'. Very Advanced and higher incarnates know that life isn't sacred. Life worship is contrary to spirit immortality. We learn, by experience and progression, that it is only the spirit that counts and the physical is no more than a temporary vehicle for the spirit. The personality of the incarnation (philosopher, prostitute, peasant or mayor) is only the temporary role for the Higher Self to experience and grow from. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved, Choices and Death Before you incarnate, you choose a variety of items, from gender to method of death. First incarnations are very, VERY basic -1 want to be ‘born here’, for example. You choose a random experience based on the location you desire. Next you may wish to choose the other gender. With progressive incarnations, the spirit matures and the list of experiences is modified and enlarged. By the time you reach Advanced incarnations, the item list is long. This is based on past incarnational experiences and experiences you still wish to have. One item that will start probably in mid-lower incarnations is choosing the manner of death. After randomly experiencing various methods of death, the spirit begins to realize shim can choose whatever method shim wants. Just remember that the Higher Self will require a huge amount of variety in death of the body for the experiences. This is everything from violent to peaceful. This includes infant death to suicide to old age as well. There is NO such thing, in the spirit realms, as ‘death before your time’. YOU CANNOT DIE BEFORE YOUR TIME. You can be some extremely fit body type and get killed by a bus or simply drop dead. You can be a smoker, like George Burns, and live to be quite old. It's ALL experience. The wail and moan over death is strictly of the body, for the body knows that that particular body will never live again. It served its purpose, so the spirit has moved on. Most of us have known people claiming to be a death's door, but seem to be hanging around for decades. YOU CANNOT DIE BEFORE YOUR TIME...and YOU set the time and method before you were born! Suicide, the big 'how dare you' of the alien masters and their religious flunkies, is another experience. I was asked to check on a suicide in the astral. When I saw him, 1 told him, \"You look pretty good for a dead guy\". That spirit had learned many valuable experiences and has since moved on. Suicide is NOT tragic to the spirit It's just another experience. The mythologies of ‘heaven’ and ‘hell’ are strictly polarity inventions with mythic heaven for the Light siders and mythic hell for the Dark siders, according to the Light side, of course. These places do not exist outside the minds of those who wish it, and it is real to them ONLY as long as they continue to believe in it. Death is nothing to be feared. It is the release the spirit gladly accepts to be free of this classroom. Death is a graduation of the spirit and should be celebrated as such. 182"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"More on Choices and Death Since the Higher Self chose the manner of death, after maturing enough to realize it can, when the individual incarnation's time to end nears, there is no healer, psychic, doctor or herbalist who can halt or change this decision. In any situation where the person is healed from seemingly life threatening situations, this is proof of an experience. When the body dies, it is proof that the Higher Self has experienced all shim required from that physical incarnation and is progressing onward. Death is what the body fears most because death of the body is forever. However all the individual incarnation experiences are forever as is the spirit that gave that body life. You are eternal, the physical incarnation is temporary. Once you realize you are not your body, death of the body is insignificant especially when you realize that YOU chose the manner and time of the death experience. Body Identification and Fear of Death News spots, commercials and talk shows all wailing about cholesterol, fat content, salt and so on attempting to control what you think of your current incarnation. This is working with overwhelming success. This is also another control element of the Game. One of the choices you made, before your current (or any) incarnation, is how you will die. The manner of death chosen is due to the Higher Selfs need for different death experiences. The deaths chosen range from old age to suicide to prime of life and everything in-between. There is no such thing, as I've said before, of dying before one’s time. You find perfect physical specimens being killed by a car or bus. You know of people who always seem to be sick, but outlive healthy people. There's the jogger who dies while jogging. On and on the examples go. When it's your CHOSEN time to die, you WILL die and cannot change what you set into motion. You WILL accomplish everything you wanted to do before you incarnated. You can even choose an incarnation that dies shortly after birth JUST for the experience of it. The only limitations are those you set. You cannot change your mind once incarnated • However you will be able to better tune your ‘next’ incarnation because of what you've discovered in the current one. NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING, can stop you from exiting when it's your time. Not all the doctors, homeopaths, shamans or anyone. If your time hasn't arrived, you will be seen past a ‘crisis’ and will have learned from it, but you didn't die because it wasn't your time. So all this drum beating about cholesterol, fat in foods, etc., is an attempt to get you to give away your power to the medical segments of society, to get you to conform to what others think you should be doing and to get you to obey. One well known saying is \"I'd rather die fat and happy than skinny and denying the pleasures of life\". You're here for experiences and to enjoy, as best you can, your incarnation. Those who control the Game want to ensure that you produce (in the Orion fashion), give away your power to those who wish to rule you (government, medical professions, peers, etc), and live a life of fear of something that cannot be changed - death. The fear of death is purely a body thing. The body fears death, as the body will have this one life only. Whereas the spirit animating that body has many, many lives. When the spirit is immature OR minion, the body’s DNA commands rule. The fear of death...the 'I'll do anything to extend this life' attitude...is body centric.

Death, for these spirits, i s just another experience and there's also the longing to return to jiill memory and get on with other experiences, especially with Final Incarnations. Homeopathy and herbals are the best for your system as they work with your immune system. Allopathic medicines will ruin your immune system. However the choices are yours based on pre-incarnational decisions. You should never be forced into a certain path. Keep your power, for you cannot ‘graduate’ from 3rd density unless you do. Let the others wail and moan over death. The Awakened know better. You do better to read labels for chemical content than fat, etc. The chemicals will get you in far worse condition than the natural substances. Enjoy your life and damn the rest. You Just ‘Dropped Dead’ - Now What? Yeah, you just dropped dead/kicked the bucket or whatever, but your physical body is no longer working. You can choose to hang around and watch those you know, but unless you're a low to mid-level incarnation, you will get bored with that quickly. Notice how the spirits that John Edward, on his Sci-Fi channel show and is a medium for, are still concerned with every day Earth life? Beings who Matrix V is geared for will never visit John Edward, or someone similar, once the body is dead. Once you're satisfied, after death, get yourself up to Monroe level 27. If you cannot do it yourself, someone will assist you strictly because you desire it. You can spend as long as you like here. As I've said earlier, the Library is huge and will be invaluable for you, as are the Healing Center and the Planning Center. What you may choose to do, on 27, is create a residence. This is easily accomplished just by visualizing it. I have a home there. I know others who have residences ranging from a castle to a lily pad. The interior and exterior are to your design and you can alter whatever at will. Once you die, time, as you've known it, no longer exists. Your own limits are your only limitations in what you can do or where you can go. Unless you are a moderately Advanced, Dominant or Final Incarnation, your desires for higher knowledge are limited. Remember, all experiences are stored within your Higher Self, and this applies to ALL incarnations. When you've had enough as that individual incarnation, the energy of that incarnation will be absorbed into the Higher Self. You do not ‘end existence’, but rather, like clothing you no longer desire to wear, the incarnation you've just finished becomes a memory, totally intact, but a memory nevertheless, and you move on to new and greater experiences. Death & The Higher Self There is so much hand-wringing over the subject of death that I will give some more information on this topic. Death and the fear of death are both BODY concerns. Remember, until you have become quite Advanced spiritually, the body will rule the spirit making the spirit basically 'along for the ride'. The body fears death more than any other single event that it can and will face. This is the basis for the misleading statement of 'you only have one life' - yes, the BODY only has one life, but YOU have hundreds and hundreds in that many different bodies, ALL of which die.

The Game is vast with a myriad of rules. I have discussed many of these rules in the Matrix 5 materials but that even pales to how many there are. The Game requires the Higher Self to choose the manner of physical body death for each of shim's incarnations BEFORE they incarnate. Just as in Dungeons &- Dragons or any other role playing game, you choose your character and the traits that character has, likewise you also do so for each of your incarnations. The Higher Self will choose a wide variety of deaths to experience since experience is the bottom line of 3rd density incarnations. You will experience deaths through disease, accident, violence and old age - just to name a few. In my own experiences, one incarnation was stabbed during the Roman Empire, another drowned and there was a variety of other gruesome deaths of the bodies. These deaths are all saved within the Higher Self just as all other experiences you have via your physical incarnations. The information will be needed further up in your progression. Death is one of the 'sacred' topics with Earthers lacking in Very Advanced development. Jokes about death are considered in poor taste by these people. This, of course, is body ID horseshit! Remember nothing is sacred and death is fear based. Earthers will try all kinds of methods/doctors to attempt to extend their physical existence, yet the jock in great shape gets run over by a car and the woman who is religious in everything she eats dies of brain cancer. The examples are numerous. What is going on is that no matter what you do or don't do, the date and the manner of death was set by your Higher Self (thus YOU) before you were born. The desire to ‘defeat death’ is mainly an Orion Empire hallmark. The Orion queen and close royals use life extending drugs (the prime one is pronounced ’sma') and cloning. With cloning, they seek to instantly transfer the queen's spirit from the old body into a cloned duplicate. The draining of others' life forces to extend one's own is a well known story on Earth. Vampires and other types of energy stealing (such as in Disney's Hocus Pocus ) are examples of these attempts to forestall death of the body by making others existence shorter. This originated with the sequential incarnates and was introduced on Earth by aliens living here. Reptilians on Earth engage in these activities with most of the so called 'missing persons' and the governments know this. These ideas, while interesting to hear, can sidetrack an Earther Higher Self if not Advanced enough because they introduce fear into their belief system and introducing as much fear as possible is an Orion/Darkside & Lightside goal to control incarnates. Body-ruled people will reject the idea of Higher Selves choosing their own deaths/time and drag out that old chestnut, 'predetermination'. This idea is a feature of some protestant religions, but, again, it's warped. Those whose religion believes in predetermination say ‘there is nothing one can do’ so you just ‘wander’ through life. THAT is a Game trap: the idea that someone is shoving a life path on you without your input. However, NO ONE is forcing your Higher Self to do anything. It is YOUR Higher Self and ONLY vour Higher Self who chooses vour experiences and your Higher Self is the real you. You must be able to grasp that if the Matrix 5 materials are to be of assistance to you on your path. You WILL know (not believe) that by the time you become your Awakened Final Incarnation. Your body cannot change its manner/time of death. ANY thoughts to that area are strictly body/immature spirit generated. NO ONE can promise and deliver to change that. You cannot 'sell your soul' to a fictitious 'devil' to do so (this topic was covered in previous M5 material). You will understand this topic on death fully when it is time for you.

All Rights Reserved. cases of death, the spirit has already separated from the body before it physically dies. You will hear how someone 'rallied' just before death to impart some message to those in attendance. The 'rally' is when the spirit briefly re-enters the dying body to give a message. The body still lives, even when the spirit is elsewhere (as in coma) due to the energy stream from the Higher Self still passing through the body. This is the same thing that keeps the body alive when one sleeps or astral travels. Sleep has also been referred to as the 'small death' as the spirit always leaves the body when it sleeps. The spirit can never die. The body definitely will. When.you read this, it will activate certain DNA commands within you in regard to the body being the omega of concerns. This is a lie that wasn't present with Ancient Earthers. This is a lie that all Higher Selves know as part of the Game. Death is nothing to fear for a spirit-in-control person as it frees you from the bonds of 3rd density and permits you to be so much more. Observations: Deceptions - \"Do this so you will live longer\" The media today is SO full of do this/don't do that so you can 'live longer'. This is a facet of the Game, so be warned. Your Higher Self, just as shim chose birth circumstances, also chose death circumstances for EACH incarnation. There is NO circumventing of this by the incarnation especially as the Higher Self knew the body's survival instinct is high and will overrule all except the most Advanced and the Final incarnations. There is NO 'contract' with your Higher Self, as some seem to believe, since the Higher Self IS you out of the costumes of the incarnations. The reason for death is the true final 3rd density experience for that incarnation. This is why Joe Jock can die while playing sports, why Debbie Diet can die in a car accident and why Harvey & Helen Health-Nuts died on 9/11. That there is SO much wailing over the death of the physical definitely shows body control heavily over spiritual. Today, on TV, the hospital nurse tells people not to eat 'comfort foods' except sparingly during the holidays, so you can 'live longer'. PURE BULLSHIT. They aren't called 'comfort foods' for nothing, you know. Unfortunately, you don't come to the realization of the tremendous power your Higher Self has until you are at the end of the incarnational cycle. Therefore, people who believe the medical garbage in the media have chosen those experiences. If they have chosen those experiences, the Higher Self will allow them so long as they don’t interfere with that individual incarnation's Plan. You cannot cheat your death time by being 'in shape' or the Orion Empire's 'ideal weight'. The example I like to use is George Burns living to 99 while drinking and smoking his whole adult life, yet how many buff bods died on 9/11 or in an accident? Consult with YOUR Higher Self for more on this, but I thought it timely to bring this up with the warning crap on TV. My advice is to enjoy what you can while you can and try not to die with regrets that you could have avoided. Where's that cherry cheesecake??? Triple Ho's!

Polarity Activities on the Astral My writings have given you much information on the Game known as ‘3rd density Earth’ and the manipulations of both Dark and Light polarities on Earthers (and beyond). So, now you just dropped dead. Are you now free of the troubles of Light and Dark? Nope. Both polarities are very active on the 4th density (astral). The lower 4th density is heavily populated by the Dark. You can run into the astral reptilians that David Icke refers to in his materials. You can also meet various Light polarities also. Both sides continue to try to keep you from knowing who you really are. They have a lot of success with low through early Advanced incarnations. These are those who haven't spiritually matured enough to see beyond 3rd density Earth and believe that ‘once they've died, everything is ok’. In an article that Val sent me, written by a student of the Monroe Institute, the last massive earthquake in India was investigated by some Lifelines graduates. The person describing the astral experience reported a tunnel that was rapidly moving the dead from where they were to where they are supposed to go. No tunnel experience of this nature has been reported by Robert Monroe or myself. Yet, here was one. Due to excessive minion incarnations in Asia, Africa and South/Central America, I am not all that surprised to hear of such a phenomenon. The Earth Spirit is very anxious to have the minion incarnations on Earth returned to the group soul from whence they came. They need to get on with their own incarnational paths in the nature realms. This tunnel was created to ease them back 'to where they belong'. In the article, a couple of \"Light beings\" came around and told the Lifelines worker to send \"Light\" to these newly dead. Light side recruitment! As I previously told you, white light is the polaric badge of the Light side. These Light workers went so far to lift the Lifeline worker to be a beacon of Light and draw in these dead. They commented on those who 'wandered' away from the camps of the dead. Minion spirits do not 'wander'. Higher Self incarnations definitely may. The Light polarity, here, continues to try and 'save' people on the astral as they do on 3rd density Earth. What is also amazing is that these Lifeline graduates seem to so easily obey what they're told without question. You MUST question. If they refuse questions, then they have an agenda that may not be your cup of tea. Non-minion dead from this event did go up to level 25, the belief systems, and the advanced dead moved up to level 27. MINION SPIRITS DO NOT MOVE TO THESE AREAS. These areas are STRICTLY for Higher Self incarnations. Minion dead can loiter on lower astral levels, but will eventually be reclaimed through the guidance of the Earth planetary spirit. Meanwhile, the Dark is trying to cause intense fear in those who spent too much time close to the 3rd density after death. Visions of sufferings, false hells, the ghosts of haunted places, etc all generate powerful fear vibrations that these Dark entities feed off of They particularly delight in causing fear to those still incarnate as the fear these people generate (both minion and Higher Self) does nothing but feed the beast, so to say. IF THEY CANNOT CAUSE YOU TO FEAR, THEY WILL NOT STAY. Fear is the weapon of choice on the astral. Just by visualizing, horrid creations can be instantaneously created for the sole purpose of instilling fear. Fear stifles your progress and MUST be overcome. Knowing what can be concocted on the astral and that they can only cause fear IF you let them, will allow you to deal with these irritants which are easily dispelled with confidence.

There are Dark and Light polarities on level 25 on the Monroe system of the 4th density. These you can readily investigate, if so interested. The religions that were/are active on Earth are all represented on level 25. The Christian 'heaven' is next to the ‘sacred’ places of other religions, but each is unable to sense the other, so wrapped up in their illusions are they. All these are stages of growth for the Higher Selves. Both extremes of polarities can wind up here, from Hitler, Stalin and the popes to ’mother' Theresa and princess Diana. They all have their Higher Selves who, with maturity, will be able to recall these incarnations back within shimselves. In these areas, both polarities try to reinforce their way among their adherents . This information is gathered by the Higher Self incarnations as just another experience. By the time the individual Higher Self reaches upper Advanced and, definitely, Awakened Final incarnations, the less influence do the polarities have on them. This is a large part of the polarity dilemma - if they can't hang on to anyone beyond a certain level, how can they advance the polaric state into the higher densities? Even so, they won’t give up. Robert Monroe, in Ultimate Journey, talked of a large, glowing being who demanded worship. This occurred on a level higher than 4th, where polarities still exist. This was a being of the Light polarity. When Monroe refused, the frustrated being moved off. Monroe held on to his power and so must you! The vast number of experiences you have on 3rd density Earth prepare you for what is to come. A large part of that is in recognizing and dealing with polarities you will run into on 4th density and beyond. It is the graduate of the Earther incarnational process that will be able to succeed far greater and with more ease than those Higher Selves who chose safer incarnational paths. Belief System Centers On The Astral The 4th density (astral) has various levels to it. Monroe levels 27 and 34/35 have already been mentioned in other materials I’ve discussed. One of the most populated areas is level 26 - the belief systems. Level 26 is the level of Christian “heavens”, oriental “nirvana”, wiccan “groves”, Greek “Elysian fields”, Norse “Valhalla” and so on. Whatever kind of post-death promised land you can think of (and some you wouldn't believe) are all on level 26 and they are ready to receive the newly departed spirit believer. I have visited a few of these centers. The spirits who gravitate to level 26 are those who have formed beliefs of ‘where they'll go once the body dies’. These levels are strictly of group or personal beliefs and not the higher learning centers of level 27. In Monroe’s books, he mentions escorting a spirit from the level of the recently dead. Bob intended to take this spirit to level 27, but the spirit vanished as they reached 26. Monroe found this happened several times. This demonstrates that the spirit cannot go to levels higher than shim is ready for. This is a self imposed limitation by the departed spirit. One point that applies to all belief systems on 26 is that they are totally unaware of any other area other than their own. The wiccan “groves” are next to the area of catholic “heaven”, etc. All exist independent of each other, of course, because any afterlife not of the groups' belief is not in that groups' reality. The Greek area is especially beautiful . A huge, white temple with marble columns, is the central feature and, yes, you can interact with the Greek deities of old.

These 'deities’ are nothing more than astral creations formed by the energies of their worshippers through time. They exist only because people continue to put energies into their form. While pagan deities are very active with their people, Christian ones are not, due to the aloof attitude the followers have imbued their mythical deities. If you want to see an interesting effect, disguise yourself to look what the Christians believe jesus or mary look like, add the dramatic touch of descending on a cloud, and watch how the spirits start to worship you. An interesting experiment. The New Age center, instead of traditional deities, has \"ascended masters\", \"councils of elders\" and similar judgment passing creations. There are books in print that describe the New Age center. In this area of 26, which is LIGHT polarity, you have to deal with other residents, \"peers\", who either approve or disapprove of your incarnational actions. You better not be a suicide and wind up here. You may get punished by forcible incarnation on an uninhabited planet! Much of the New Age center seems very similar in structure to the film 'Defending Your Life', as that is one thing you do before the judges. ALL belief structures on 26 are simply that, belief structures. We've all been to various of them, depending on incarnational beliefs and time periods. Once a belief system loses adherents, the images begin to fade with time. There are some former beliefs that have only tatters of disintegrating energy remaining. The main point to be made here is that all belief centers are artificial constructs that have control (to varying degrees) and conformity as rules. In reality, there are no deities, elder councils or ascended masters who sit in judgment over you unless YOU let them. This is why getting connected to your Higher Self is so important. Once you are connected, you will pass over level 26 and go to the Advanced, non-deity, non-master area - level 27 - where you can interact with your Higher Self. Astral Defenses and The Higher Self Last night I told Val about a soul retrieval that I did for a friend a couple of days ago. At one point, an astral entity, who had been engaged in harassing my friend, saw me and said, \"Ah, someone else for me to tamper with\". This entity was generally adult human in shape and size except for 2 'S' shaped horns on his head above each ear. No sooner did he say that to me and I sheared off his horns. That caught him by surprise. I told the being that he's not to mess with my friend any more or I'd do more than that. Then I followed up giving him a couple zaps of energy to get him moving away. The entity was totally stunned by the outcome and was, obviously, not use to dealing with someone who wasn't in fear and knew astral self-defense. There are ALL types of beings on the astral and above. Monroe describes some in his trilogy. I've seen many more than he^s described. Some are very nice, some are neutral and some are unpleasant and even dangerous. I have been trained, as a shaman, on how to deal with the various types of beings 011 the astral. This training allowed me to be ready for part of my Higher Selfs vast store of information on protection and defense.

It would be a Lightsider reaction to say 'ignore any astral being and they’ll leave you alone'. It would be a Darksider reaction to spiritually nuke an astral being who you feel challenged by. The Balance reaction is a mix of both Dark and Light, If you are threatened, you use a demonstration of your abilities to cause the being to think twice before proceeding with a threat to you. Ignoring this type of entity encourages them to be bolder since they take it as a sign of weakness on your part. You would be perceived as a Lightsider. Balance uses enough of a demonstration that causes the entity to stop. If more of a demonstration was needed for a stubborn entity, that can easily be arranged. Some times it is necessary to return them to a pure energy state, especially if they are created by someone's thought. Now as to how much energy and to what level to use it - Whenever I am confronted on the astral, I never hesitate on what to do. With the above example, I didn't pause and think about what was an appropriate action. I proceeded with the action quicker than Samantha could twitch her nose. This is when the pure energy of the Higher Self with all shim's knowledge and experiences comes to call. The Higher Self would never allow the Awakened Final to be bullied on the astral. You really have no idea of the enormity of abilities that is found within your Higher Self. The only limitations are ones you imagine. If you have to hesitate and try to reason what to do in that type of a situation, first of all, you shouldn't be confronting astrals or you can have an experience that could even kill your physical body. Second, if you have to stop and think, you are not an Awakened Final as this level is the purist extension of the Higher Self outside the Higher Selfs being. Third, you cannot bluff on the astral. Your aura reveals the truth about you. This brings to mind the lesson in the bible (yes, you can adapt one or two things from that book) where some men saw demons possessing someone else. These guys said, ’we saw (non-existent) jesus and paul (I think) cast out demons, so we can too*. They used the words that they saw as effective, but the demons said, ’we know jesus and we know paul (or whoever it was), but we don’t know you'. The words, without the ability, meant nothing. They proceeded to beat the hell out of these guys. The same holds true on the astral but in different form. The name 'jesus' has no power on those levels. However if you try to ACT like you have power/training that you don't, the being would see you are bluffing and proceed to have their way with you if for no other reason than to teach you a lesson. The astral and other spirit beings are not to befooled with trivially. Remember polarities exist up through the next few densities. You must act responsibly. You can learn some astral lessons on Monroe level 27, but the vast amount of higher density lessons wait for you AFTER your Final Incarnation has summoned all of your Higher Selfs incarnations back home and you progress upward. The invaluable lessons you learn on the 3rd density will translate to the spirit realms. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 190"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Observations: Ghosts - New Information Ghosts seem to be significant on TV these days. Some depict ghosts in civil war areas, some on ships, some in haunted areas, etc. While these can be interesting programs, they are NOT all ghosts. When you see what appears to be a ghost and this spirit is doing a routine function or a repeating task, this is NOT a ghost but rather you are seeing into another time period where that person (not ghost) is moving about doing things common to that person. That this person is always seen doing the same function indicates that is where the fracture in 'time' is occurring and it makes the viewer think the event is ‘repeating’, while it is simply the same event being viewed over and over. When you go into a known haunted area and ghosts are making noise, creating lights, moving items and similar, those are true ghosts or lowest 4th density beings. These are trying to get your attention or frighten you. The difference between a ghost and seeing into another time period is that the ghost notices you but the other time period person does not. This is why there could be a repeating scene of a woman carrying a tray down a flight of stairs or civil war soldiers shooting. There is an anomaly in the illusionary fabric of'time' that is allowing you to see this. Linear time is an illusion and ALL our incarnations are doing their things at the same 'time'. This is a VERY Advanced concept. Viewing another time period is a one-way event that seems to have begun in the 20th century and is increasing in frequency. This ability was extremely rare in earlier centuries. There are LOTS of stories of so-called ghosts who are really quite alive in their time, but being viewed from our time as a ‘vision’. The conductor who is seen every night waving his lantern by a railroad track, the civil or revolutionary soldier who is always seen loading his rifle, the woman who is spotted in 18th century garb and goes from room to room checking - all of these are examples of time visions. These people do NOT notice us in our time because they are alive in their period. They are unable to communicate to or even to see the viewers. IF they were able to see us, they would think that WE are the ghosts. Yet, with true ghosts, they DO notice you and DO try to get your attention. These can be recently dead or family dead who want to hang around for whatever reason. They can also be of the lowest 4th density beings who want to feed off the fear of the living by scaring them. So, when you watch those shows on TV or read about them, remember what I've told you hear and understand with this new knowledge. It WILL make a difference. Simultaneous Incarnation Overlaps & Ghosts (revisited) (Special Gold Edition Segment) Do you notice how some people are really hung up on certain periods of history or historical locations ? There's the man who is wrapped up in the American Civil War to such a degree that he seems to be concerned with that as much as he is concerned with the present day. Then there's a woman who is totally surrounded by the colonial period and entering her home you could swear you stepped back in history by 250 years. A World War II buff, born after that event, who is fascinated by the period or a certain segment of that period (Japanese, German, etc), and all spare time is used in collecting items from that period or delving into facts of the period.

All Rights Reserved. These are just a few examples of something not uncommon among the simultaneously incarnating. Remember, since all incarnations are occurring at the same time AND your Higher Self is currently processing information from EACH of these numerous incarnations, there can be a certain amount of one incarnation's vibration into another provided that the incarnation is having strong experiences. You are not likely to have a peasant incarnation in the Dark Ages filter into your 21st century incarnation because the peasant incarnation would not be a significant one. However, your love of Roman artifacts or 18th century furniture does indicate something significant about the incarnation of that time to transfer that interest into your 21st century self. Deja vu is the term commonly used when this incarnational vibration occurs. The same can be said for the immersing in ancient Greek culture by some in the 18th century or the Atlantean cravings of others. These are energy transfers. This is easier to observe when dealing with 'past' time periods than 'future' periods due to an easy link to the past, post-Atlantean worlds, via books, tv, etc. If you are having a significant incarnation now, depending on where you are and how it is significant, a taste of that can slip into one of your Advanced level incarnations of the time 'past'. Advanced incarnations are more equipped to handle the revelations. This can show as interests in things that do not yet exist. The revolutionary, the bohemian and those out of step with the current norm may all be having this happen to them. It can be unsettling to contemporaries as it encourages change and exploration . As I have mentioned in an earlier segment, what people think are ghosts, in most cases, are just visions into other time periods, a rift in the fabric of time phases that allows you today to see something occurring simultaneously in the 'past'. Battlefields are common time rifts, where ghosts of seemingly old battles are fighting. This is not a ‘repeat of an old performance’, but a look through a hole in time. These participants do not interact with you and, if they saw you, they would assume that YOU are the ghost in strange clothing. In actuality the 'ghosts' are very much alive in their time period. A genuine 'ghost' would be someone who has died and interacts with the physical incarnate. The vibrations we call 'time' are not difficult to pass through. Our Higher Selves are constantly involved in all time periods that shim has an incarnation. These incarnations are just as alive as we are now. If you were to astral time travel, anyone, from that year you chose to visit, who saw you would call you a 'ghost'. When I went to the year 1600, the Native Americans who saw me believed I was a spirit being. It's all a matter of perspective in this illusion heavy Game. Game Over: The Moment Of Knowing (Special Gold Edition Segment) In earlier segments, I wrote about the end of an incarnation on the astral after physical death. There comes a point where the incarnation, on the astral, remembers who shim is and, with a flash of \"ah-ha\", that incarnation disappears from the astral and returns to their Higher Self. This occurs when that Higher Selfs Final Incarnation summons in all simultaneous incarnations and removes shimself from the Game. The \"ah-ha\" comes when full memory is restored to the astral segments of that Higher Self, just moments before the now whole Higher Self leaves for other densities. The reason why a Higher Self does not hang around with incarnations truly aware is because the second stage of the Game on 3rd density Earth is being played out on the astral 192"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"4th density. This is why much of the astral is a reflection of the physical. Fully aware Higher Self incarnations of the simultaneous path, other than a Final Incarnation, would know far too much to play the Game as per its rules. Polarity becomes severely threatened and has to submit to Balance if this were to happen. This is contrary to the Game. Hence, when a Higher Self has completed the simultaneous path via shim's Final Incarnation, this manifestation, when ready, summons all that Higher Selfs incarnational streams back within through the Nexus of Time. When the summons is given, the filters and blocks of each incarnation are removed. The glow of 'knowing' fills each incarnation as they meld back into the Higher Self. They remove their 'costumes' of the Game, become one with the Final Incarnation and proceed to new experiences and challenges outside of the 3rd density Game. I did a shamanic technique on a suicide case a few years back at the request of the father of this man. I told the recently deceased about the Library on 27 where he can find the answers that he needs. Some months after that, the spirit of the suicide case appeared briefly in my living room to tell me to tell his father that \"wait until he discovers what I found out\". The spirit was really overjoyed and, after delivering his message, he vanished from the astral. I am revealing in this Gold Edition what happened to him. This will happen to all incarnations of your Higher Self under direction of the Final Incarnation. THAT will be an absolutely wonderful, liberating moment when it occurs to us.

Why are people, with sane curiosities, unable to take the experience? When I approach someone I've been observing with these types of questions, they almost always will avoid answering them with the truth. Oh, they'll tell me all kinds of fluff and sparkle, but rarely the truth. One example: I don't know how many times I've heard or been told that male A is \"just curious\" about gays and gay life while being married to a female. Almost all of the men I've done the pleasure dance with have been married with kids. Does your wife know? Of course not, she has no idea. Why are you married if you prefer being with a man? This one has them pause, mumble some nonsense usually about others' expectatioris of them, and so on. So, you're living your life for someone else then? \"I'm just curious\", they say. I bet you are, but curious does not mean visiting me every Thursday when your wife is at adult evening classes. That was in the 8o's, by the way. Yes, society and alien DNA commands put you in that prison, but only YOU have the key to that cell and the key is YOU. THEY don't want you to know that you ARE the key! Another example is someone (male or female) who lives the lie of a marriage with someone they are incompatible with. We ALL know people like that. Like one of my friends said to me recently, \"In that case, what's the point?\". Very true. When quizzed about this, the lamest excuse is 'for the kids’, but fingers will point all over the place. I can tell you that the worst reason to stay together is 'for the kids'. Kids notice EVERYTHING and it does them more harm to grow up in a hostile home than any other single reason. Not only that, both people are being unfair to themselves and each other by allowing it to continue. Again, the key to this cell is YOU. These 2 examples (and you can think of many more yourself) have a common root reason for existing - FEAR. Yeah, the Fear Tree has many poisoned fruits on them - such fruits as others' expectations, financial, kids, etc - and these people would prefer if you just pick a fruit or two and be satisfied while watering the roots of the fear tree with tears of self- pity. Removing the fruit does NOT deal with or end the problem. The problem is the source of the fruits - FEAR. Instead of watering the roots with tears, use your key to escape the situation. Yes, alien DNA commands DO fit into the equation as well. All these byproducts of the Fear Tree will keep low and mid level incarnations in line even much of the Advanced levels. These are learning experiences for the incarnation. By repetitive dips in this experience pool, the progressing spirit eventually recognizes the pattern, the experiential loop, and will also eventually break the cycle. If the cycle wasn't broken, the spirit would never progress. One cannot change this progressional cycle of the spirit. This is true, BUT one can point out the fear factor to an incarnation and, depending on the level of progression, the spirit may 194"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. get that needed spark and start to end the loop, even if not until another incarnation. The tricky part here is NOT to try and force the matter. It would simply be to make the comment, answer any questions if they ask and let it go. That’s the Law of Allowance. You allow them to make their own mistakes even after you give vour best advice. They will learn FAR more if they experience the pain of their decisions and the consequences of these decisions. The thing is that IF they are in pain, they can alter their path by making new decisions provided they can overcome their own fears. Remember THEY have to do this. Don't nag them. Be their friend even if they don't make the decisions you would. We are ALL at different levels of progression. The Law of Allowance is quite simple, but you won't be able to recognize/handle it properly until you reach Awakened Final Incarnation for your Higher Self. This brings another point in mind. Balance is NOT neutrality. Neutrality is lack of Balance and stagnation. Balance is quite active. Think on this, but don’t fault yourself if you can't quite grasp what I've said. You WILL when it is YOUR time. Observation: Fear and Manipulation The 'bottom line' purpose of incarnating in 3rd density is experience and what we learn from all the experiences we have via all our incarnations. We are now in the EndGame years and there are more varieties of experiences today than any other time since Atlantis was destroyed. On the other hand, there are those who seek to deny you experiences hoping that by denying you what you are here for, that ‘EndGame will be extended and postponed’. Here's a review of some of those who attempt to stop EndGame from occurring: *Governments - The purpose of government has become the erection of fences to severely restrict potential experiences. An example is in California, medical marijuana use is legal. In US federal law it isn't. So federal goons are currently overriding state laws, not for the good of anyone, but to restrict. Governments have been regulating countries based on the dominant religion of the country. We know what religion is and more will be said below. Governments have been the enforcement group for religion by making mythological philosophies enforceable on non-believers. Sexual restrictions are all religious based and tainted by the alien restrictions dealing with matters of procreation. Laws against gays, polygamy, etc all have their origins with religion. Governments should be minimally involved in people's lives and concerned with protection of the people from those who seek to do violence against them. Instead, the governments (on ALL levels) meet to figure out how to further restrict the population they control (note control, not serve). Government SHOULD be serving the people, not religion, not special interest groups and definitely not for the highest bidder. You also hear the power hoarders in Washington talk about \"continuity of government\" as being so damned important. Yeah, it's important to them, not to those who have Advanced beyond the need to be controlled. If EndGame brings about government collapse, good riddance! Also, the worst thing to do in that case, would be to attempt to re-establish the same government. Break that experiential loop. Governments are agents of the Game and the Dark polarity. Deception is their shroud and control their game. Idealistic, new politicians either fall to the Dark or are replaced or otherwise removed from the scene. Governments have become major players in restricting your experiences.

Religion is sequential incarnate-oriented, since the roots are with aliens and the sequential incarnates. There are some minor exceptions to this, but even in the minor exceptions, sequentially incarnating is still the cornerstone (the “you only have one life” bullshit). You cannot control simultaneous incarnating Higher Selves due to the nature of the simultaneous experience. You DO have control over sequentials to a certain extent, hence the karma myth (“in my/your next incarnations, you owe me”...). Sequentials are also born with their memory intact so you can chase down someone who 'did you wrong' when you've discovered where they were reborn. This is what slows down progression for the sequential path Higher Self. They drag their baggage from one incarnation to another. Now, that's fine for them as that's their path, but when they attempt to make their way OUR way, they become agents for the Game. Their beliefs form the core of Earther mainstream religions with basically 'everything for god' as the theme, which goes back to when the aliens genetically manipulated Earthers to serve them. The 10 Commandments are nothing but alien commandments meant for Earther slaves and not the aliens themselves. A whole book could be written on that topic alone. Religion exists to limit your experiences and for you to surrender your vower to an external being while keeping you ignorant of your Higher Self and true nature. *Medical Groups - The medical organizations are very much fear based information machines. \"If you do this, if you don't do that, cholesterol, fat, etc\" (medical mantras)...FEAR that if you don't obey, you may not live to be 90, but may die at <gasp> 75. This is another denier of simultaneous incarnates and is truly body ID oriented. Your Higher Self can have as many incarnations as shim desires. There are NO restrictions on it. Also, the Higher Self sets the time and manner of death. Worrying about all the hand wringing, body oriented, fear based pronouncements of the medical establishment will NOT extend your life one second longer than your Higher Self has decided that it should be. This is why George Burns could live to 99 and smoke cigars and this is why the jock type who does everything the medicals want is hit by a bus at age 28. When one parrots cholesterol, fat or whatever medical fear, that’s the body talking and NOT the spirit. These people also deny themselves pleasures they crave, thus experiences, because they beLIEve, for example, that 'fat is bad for you', meanwhile they drown themselves in DIEt aspartame drinks and pop pills for control of every twitch the body may come up with. If you trust in your Higher Self, you act accordingly. If you allow your body to control you, yes, you gain that experience, but that incarnation is not in Very Advanced stages. One store owner I know said that she \"fears high cholesterol because the doctor told her she could have a stroke and not be able to move\". Fear is the weapon here. Under the guise of 'we're here to help you', these groups actually exist to control you and deny you significant experiences by having you give away your power to them. There are other groups that you can add to these, but you get the general idea. There are always groups or people who want you to give away your power to them for the purpose of controlling/manipulating YOU and denying YOU experiences that are not sanctioned by the polarities. Waking up to this is one of the goals of your incarnations. This is followed up by realizing you don't need these groups/people as you are whole within yourself and that they exist to build fences around you to keep you in a box of their creating. Until you can break free of these so-called authority figures/groups, you are still significantly Game bound. 196"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Fear, Control and Your Power I've written about ’fear’ in numerous Matrix 5 segments. Fear is your worst enemy and it is used by both the Dark and the Light polarities as their MAIN weapon in the Game. Fear is something EVERY Higher Self incar national series will have to overcome in order to move forward. There are many types of fear, but it’s still the same energy. The difference is that this energy comes in many disguises. At work today, 2 foreign students (in their 20’s) were in an office using a public access computer. Not only were they using it improperly, they decided to start making out at that desk. Needless to say, the office workers were not happy with that scene. One told the two to stop that in this place of business and if they want to make out, they must leave and find a motel. The foreigners ignored the instruction and, shortly after, started up again. The office worker then threw them out. This worker is not a supervisor. Where was the supervisor? In her cubical \"listening\" and approving of it. The question is, why didn't this supervisor (paid big bucks) come out of her office to supervise and throw them out herself? Fear. While a good paperwork supervisor, she's a poor people supervisor. She was afraid to \"deny these foreigners services\" in a public office. She was afraid that someone might sue her for calling them to task for disturbing the office routine by supervising. This is the short version of this story but the point is made. This woman is heavily fear bound and this is just one incident of it. Fear has been the MOST successful weapon used in the world and, especially in the United States. Fear is having a field day in this country. This is being stirred up by both polarities. Fear \"terrorists\", fear \"the unknown\", fear \"arabs\", fear \"witches\", fear \"gays\", fear \"people acting suspicious (at least in your opinion)\", fear people \"different\" than you and so on. The US is SO fear bound that they'll give away all of their power and constitutional rights just so those who are using the fear weapons will \"protect\" them. Giving away one's power to an external deity is a major goal of those who use fear. Deity doesn't only refer to fictitious gods, aliens and the like, but also to ANY external source who seeks it. If you are controlled by fear, your body still significantly controls YOU. Fear also feeds those lower astral entities who will do anything that they can to induce fear in the 3rd density incarnates. I've talked to some people who tell me that they aren't afraid of anything. People who say that are putting on a false front. These people have some deep fears that they refuse to acknowledge because they don't want to have to deal with them. They feel, in most cases, that it’s a weakness to have fears. It's not a weakness to have fears, but rather it's a weakness to deny them. You have to acknowledge them before you can handle them and relegate them to where they belong. Someone may not be afraid of many physical situations, but they can be afraid that someone finds out they are lacking in the mental department, for example. Someone with internal insecurities (fears), may be like the drag queen in the corner of the bar or a bully who is hypercritical of almost everyone that they see. Someone with intellect in one or two fields may fear that people won’t think he or she doesn't know \"everything\". Fearing of ‘not being perfect’, except that really means not conforming to others' limits or expectations. Based on these few examples, you can easily add your own.

Aquarius is the sign of true freedom. Cancer is not. It is the sign of tradition and intolerance for change not initiated by itself. The hippie era of the late 6o's is a great example of Aquarius shaking up Cancer. Cancer is not tolerant, it is controlling. Cancers can fear true freedom.You see what the US is doing in the world and that Darkside president, who is also a controlling Cancer, is doing. Both are great at \"do as I say, not as I do\". And what is their big weapon? FEAR! Fear Iraq, fear Taliban, fear muslims, fear this & that - mantras of the current, appointed president. What does this fear encourage? Giving up your 'rights' - surrendering your 'power' to an external deity whose icons include flags, statues and the like. They also talk down to you, \"the bad people\" the White House reptilian says. Something to consider is that when you fear, you WILL attract to you exactly what you fear. This is part of the Game. This is given to you to overcome it. Only the body-ruled fear death, yet death is the prime cloak the government loves to dress fear in. Another example: I will be in Orlando for Halloween this year. People have said to me (again since my trip to China last April was apparently not enough for them) not only the standard (since 9/11) 'aren't you afraid to fly?' but also 'Orlando is on the list of hit sites for <gasp> terrorists - aren't you afraid to go?' Hell, no! But, they might kill <double gasp> you! Big fucking deal. Then I'll be free to summon back my incarnations and proceed elsewhere. It's their bodies talking/reacting while the not-mature-enough spirit is along for the ride and, hopeful, will learn from it. Fear of death - the BIG fear of the body. Overcoming fear is a LONG process taking hundreds and hundreds of incarnations. It is a major goal for your Higher Self via the incarnational streams. You WILL succeed by your Awakened Final Incarnation. Don't put yourself down because of fears, but DO examine them and admit them to yourself. Try and come to terms with them. Attempt to handle them. Education is a good way to start. Fear of spiders, snakes or other creepies? Read up on them and gain an understanding of them. Replace fear with caution. They are NOT the same things. Caution comes with maturity. Cautions move fears to an understanding level. If you don’t know the difference between fear and caution, do some research on the terms. If you want to see fear in the eyes of someone, tell them about some of David Icke's topics - child slavery by the government or reptilian shape-shifters, for example. Most will quickly dismiss these topics out of FEAR. Fear because if they were shown the evidence, they know they'd have to do something about this one way or another (and there is more than one way to handle this material). And if they do show an interest, the most likely response is: who will save us? ( external deity again ) Fear also because they'd have to face the lie of American 'freedoms' arid image. It's far too heavy of a thing to deal with until you reach the upper Mid-Advanced ranges and beyond. You will also learn how to deal properly with these issues WHEN you're ready. If fear can make you SO used to giving away your power and having others protecting/helping so much that you are nothing more than a dependent on others or a ward of the government, you have become a perfect citizen of the Orion Empire. The queen likes people like this - people who obey and fear - because they are so easily controlled. Consider that, especially in regard to other Matrix 5 materials. “We will think for you”, they say. This is a major dead end and very difficult in this time period due to all the technology that hasn't been around since Atlantis sank. It's EndGame. Be aware of fear. Take back your power ! 198"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Observation: Law of Allowance & Earther 'Freedom' The Law of Allowance is the law of freedom. You know what the Law of Allowance is if you've read the Handbook trilogy or the Matrix 5 materials. This Universal Law IS freedom itself. Keeping this in mind, examine the use of the word 'freedom' on Earth, especially within the US. As you know, the Game warps Universal Laws through polarities and deceptions. You hear the polarity stooges in Washington talk about defending 'freedom'. This is not true. The word 'love' also means 'sex', yet they are not related terms. You can love someone without ever having sex with them. You can have sex with someone and not even LIKE them. The same goes for the Game's use of 'freedom'. It does not mean the same thing as the word implies. For fascists/Christian orthodox, 'freedom' means they are free to subject you to their forms of control but, on the other hand, these people will not tolerate opposition to their control. They are free to impose their narrow minded beliefs on those who could care less. These people also want their archaic values forced on those who seek to expand their interests/experiences. The Game loves using the words like 'tradition/family values/society' to attempt to keep you in line and away from allowing your Higher Self to grow. For the ultra liberals, 'freedom' means they are free to impose speech limitations and foreign mannerisms on those who just want to be left alone. They want to impose a false tolerance which the Game is using as a disguise to break the US up by language/culture/religion and just about any other divisive means they can think of in the name of pseudo tolerance. The Game knows you cannot force spiritual Advancement. It must come at your own time and at your own pace. The Game uses these two extremes to create conflict and all in the name of 'freedom'. This freedom bears NO resemblance to the Law of Allowance. Desire to control others is NOT 'freedom'. Imposing your will, whether it be individual, national or global, on another is NOT 'freedom'. Intolerance, an attitude unfortunately TOO common in the US, is of the Game and not of the Universal Laws. American 'freedoms' are a real serpents' stew of lies and deceptions. So, when you hear the drums of war in Washington and the American Adolph spicing war/Dark polarity rhetoric with the word 'freedom', it is just another attempt to deceive the population. One polarity loves it. The other hates it. Polarity conflict - the core of the Game. The end result is that only Balance is effective and the way of the highest densities. Searching For “The Higher Power” In this film I saw, an alien asks an Earther woman about all the religious icons in her room. She explains that these items are each connected to a different 'Higher Power' and she's searching for the right Higher Power for herself. The alien asks how will you know when you've found the right one. She responds that she'll know. The search for the Higher Power has taken Earthers down countless dead ends, such as Christianity, judaism, muslimism, hinduism, etc. Churches, synagogues, mosques and all other gathering places for these dead ends are filled with people who believe they have found their Higher Power.

All Rights Reserved. The only Higher Power that should be of concern to you is your Higher Self and no others. In Robert Monroe's trilogy, he describes his travels (in 4th density and higher) when this huge, glowing being commands Bob to \"worship me for I am your god\". The entity briefly caught Bob off guard. When he processed the request, Bob knew this was only a resident of this particular density (above 4th). He refused to comply with this unreasonable demand and the being threw a fit while Bob moved on. Read the trilogy if you haven't already. There are numerous beings who want you to give away your power to them. Regaining your f - ] power, both on Earth and beyond, is one of your major goals in order to spiral out of 3rd density Earth. Power thieves take the guises of priest, minister, president, congressman, rabbi, mayor or anyone in an \"authority\" position. Instead of these people working for you, they have taken your power and wind up ruling you. Most of their time seems to be used to decide on new laws, which tell you what you can't do. People fall all over someone in authority positions while these elected officials and religious types should be catering to you. Why do people fall all over power takers? Repeating: take back your power from these control mongers. The prime goal is remembering that the ONLY Higher Power that you must listen to is your Higher Self. Any other entity, that seeks your following, is deceiving you. The loss of connection and knowledge of your Higher Self began when you chose the Earth incarnational route and the genetic scientists from Orion made every effort to keep you from ever finding shim again. They failed. They greatly delayed the victory, but in the end they failed. Your Dominant and, primarily, your Final incarnations are the keys to unlocking your higher Self and cement long lost control over your incarnations. Your Higher Self accepted the challenges and rapid growth achieved only through Earth incarnations. The Higher Self is destined to succeed and this success is realized when the Final Incarnation signals the end of the 3rd density experience and the advancement to higher realms. Deity - A Major Power Giveaway An interviewer on television asks a woman what Thanksgiving means to her and, I swear, every few words were followed by the tired phrase: 'I thank god'. The crediting of your life's benefits to some non-existent, puppet master/mistress deity is probably the most major and unfortunate giving away of one's power. You cannot advance beyond the 3rd/4th densities as long as you cling to this misplaced loyalty. The origin of deity on Earth arrived with the Orion/Sirian Empires. Ancient Earth humans had no deities. Enter the Empires, who convinced the Earthers, with their impressive technology, that indeed they were 'gods'. Once they had divided the humans into genders and slashed/altered their DNA structures, Earthers became so dependent on the aliens that they were 'thankful' to their deities for what they were given by these Dark beings. With time, enter the priesthoods. These were ‘representatives’ of Earthers to the aliens. This go-between position was kept even after the overt alien presence on Earth was diminished. Priesthoods are positions of power and control over Earthers and their deception continues today. Of course in the lower ranks of priests and ministers, they do believe the manure they shovel at people. However, the Vatican, Westminster Abby, Salt Lake City's mormon leadership and so on know exactly where their loyalties lie. 200"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The priesthoods exist to continue the myth of deity control and to keep Earthers from discovering who they really are. It is you and your interactions with others that have brought you to where you are, NOT some non-existent or alien gods or goddesses. Your Higher Self is in control of your life, not an alien or a fictitious deity. Since you are your Higher Self, if you give thanks, give thanks to yourself and others who you are close to, but mainly to your Higher Self, the real you. When you reclaim this major lost power, you will run into a lot of flack by lower incarnates and minions. What, they say, you don't say 'god bless you'?! You don’t credit an external source for everything you have and are?! How dare you wake up! How dare you try and exit the Game! How dare you be true to yourself! Indeed. Phrases other than 'god bless you', such as references to 'the lord', 'the god/goddess', 'the prophet' are all key to keeping the thumb of religion over your crown chakra. You need to slap this thumb away to gain access to your Higher Self. The thumb is a filter keeping much needed truths away from you. This thumb keeps you away from your Higher Self and, therefore, your true identity. So, at this holiday time of the year, reclaim your power. If you've advanced far enough to drop the religious horse shit and give thanks to yourself and those who mean something to you, you have come far toward spiraling out of the Game. Forget mythology and alien meddlers. Thank you, Higher Self. Gods: DNA Command & Creation of Them 'Bow down to god', 'worship god', 'praise god' and countless other power giveaway phrases are heard all too commonly. What is it with gods who need/require worship? If you are all so damned powerful and omniscient, why do you insist on this? To answer these questions requires a 2-pronged reply. The first is the origin of deities on Earth.. That Earthers were always looking for deities originally began with the Orion/Sirian Empires genetic rape of Ancient Earthers into genders and subsequent imposing of DNA commands in these new beings that include subservience to their alien masters. Since this original period, other alien groups came to use Earth for their genetic experiments. These aliens showed up in amazing crafts as well as some time/inter-dimensional travelers who likewise came and went in non-common ways. The locals were so taken by these amazing feats that they felt that these beings must be 'the gods' of old. Therefore the idea of superior beings was implanted through DNA commands and direct observation of outstanding technology. These alien 'gods' demanded obedience and subservience, especially the Orion/Sirian Empires. Refer back to Matrix 5 for more on this early period. America's current 'god crazy' phase with the pledge of allegiance shows the body, under alien DNA 'worship god' commands in over-drive! Where you see someone foaming at the mouth for their 'god' shows either a minion incarnation or a body in control over the immature spirit. The same goes for the muslims and their body oriented god fanaticism. Both are different expressions of the same DNA command and they cause the strife the Orion Empire wants to divide the population.

This is one ‘problem’ that the Orion Empire has observed with Earthers and one of the reasons why they intend to redesign Earther humans into something else. This will not happen. You will have to wait and see how the EndGame develops. The second prong of the answer, to the first paragraph's questions, involves the lower astral AND Monroe level 25. When the Ancient Earthers were split into genders and the DNA command to 'obey god' was installed, the Empire knew the worship would satisfy on 2 levels, the physical and the astral. The physical is obvious. The astral involved certain lower astral beings molding the freely given energies of worship especially if worshipped in FEAR. This fed the lower astral beings. 'Fear of god' is still a common theme among religions. The Christians will say “if you can’t love god, then fear of god will keep you in line”. This/ear is shown in mythical hell fantasies of devils and burnings. Does mythic hell exist? It does exist in the lowest astral due to all the energy put into creating it by those who believe in it. It is merely an astral creation unknowingly created by the beings who are the true 'gods' but are not yet aware of their own abilities! One cannot be 'sent' there. One can only 'go' there IF one believes that is where they must go. The same is true of the religious sectors of Monroe level 25. When I visited that level, there was a section of level 25 for the Christians, the muslims, the pagans, the hindus, etc and no group was aware enough to sense/see the others. You can go to the Greek pagan sector and converse with Athena, Hermes, etc and they will tell you that they are who you see. In fact, these are the astral creations by those who worship these beings. The worshipers have created the astral gods who MUST have continued worship/devotion energy to sustain their existence. You can find gods, who no longer have devotees, whose forms are fading away. ALL these pseudo deities WILL eventually return to their formless energy states when Earther Higher Selves leave and move on. As Monroe says in his books, in the future, level 27 with the great library and healing center will no longer exist because the need is no longer there. Likewise will the other levels created by Earther Higher Selves dissipate what was created. The True Gods will have ceased to create at those levels. We will have moved on to new experiences and no longer need to dabble in these areas at that level. So much for you to consider here. A New Perspective On An Alien Order When ancient Earth humans were divided into genders, the first verbal command the alien genetic scientists gave was, \"We are your gods. You will have no other as your god.\" Through the ages, it has been remembered. In the Middle Ages, it was placed into the common English of the day and after being altered to fit the existing one god religions that emerged. You recognize it as, \"I am the lord, thy god. Thou shalt have no other god before 11 me. Why do they still keep archaic English with those bothersome 'thee/thou' phrases? You may well be told they are now considered ‘royal’ terms, despite the fact that everyone, who spoke English, talked that way. Thee/thou have evolved into you/your. European royalty decided they were above the common people and clung to those terms in formal speech. The same goes for their alien masters. They consider it a sign of respect for your betters.

My intent here is not to focus on this but rather to give you something to consider based on the original command. Everyone with a higher Self should rephrase the command into a statement. Since there are none of these mythical deities, and forget worshipping aliens, replace the image of 'god' with the eternal and ‘sole source of all’ to you , your Higher Self. This makes your Higher Self your 'god'. This concept is fully comprehended by awakened Final Incarnations \"I am your god\" calls you to recognize your real self, your Higher Self, the ultimate authority on you and the creator of all your incarnations. No one except your Higher Self can say that with authority. One of the purposes of the Dark AND Light polarities is to deny you this knowledge and keep you looking for external authorities on you and your path. This is a major block you must overcome, for you will never find your Higher Self until you look within. \"You will have no others as your god\" cautions you about looking for external salvation as I said above. Your Higher Self cautions you that looking away from your inner self will prove to be a dead end. No aliens, mythological deities (they're ALL mythological) or religious leader can 'save' you. Yes, you do get ideas and other input from external sources, but you must adapt this input to fit you and your path. You discard what you don't need and adapt needed ideas to suit you. By doing this (more and more as you advance incarnationally), you form your own Yellow Brick Road that will take you home to your Higher Self, higher densities and the experiences they have to offer in your progression. The best is yet to come! Observations: Disruptive Symbol to Chakras - Cross \"The Christian cross is a symbol that will disrupt any chakra that it is placed over. It’s the structure of the cross that does it. Many wear it around the throat. It will disrupt your throat chakra (clairaudience) making it not operate correctly. Many wear it on a longer chain and it's positioned over the heart. It will disrupt your heart chakra (major positive emotional center and gateway to higher abilities'). Some wear it on their belts. It will disrupt your solar plexis chakra (defensive systems). I can see why Christians wear it since it symbolizes their slavery to the alien 'deities' and Christian mythological beings. However, why do non-christians wear it as jewelry? I saw a Native American dancer (an outstanding dancer) wearing a huge silver cross over his breastplate as he danced. Nothing sadder than a Native American in total defeat by supporting their conqueror's religion. Similar to American blacks following their former master's mythological religion. The wearing of the cross is encouraged by Christian leaders of most of their cults. A notable exception is mormon, who is much better at employing 'curses if you do/don't' on their members. Those who made wearing a cross ‘acceptable’ knew the effect when they initiated the process. Since religion is primarily concerned with keeping its sheep in the dark, they will use any symbols they can to enhance that state of darkness.

This is a Native American symbol, among others. These tend to encourage balance in a chakra or area. Very Advanced and higher incarnates should be aware of these 2 symbols. 1 threw out all crosses/crucifixes a LONG time ago. I don't recommend you give them to someone as it will cause them at least subtle damage. Throw them out in the garbage where they belong. I made sure the couple I had were broken first. The Law of Allowance say anyone who wants to wear this destructive symbol be allowed to do so. It's their path and current choice. Even if the reader of this wants to continue to wear it, do what you feel you must. Choices are yours. This information is given so you are aware of the consequences of it. ‘Tis The Season - Another Look At Religion Tis the season...a fun time, Sagittarius of good times is in force, yet we are drilled with the religious myths of jesus and his fictitious birth. This, of course, is to remind you (over and over again) that ‘you should owe everything’ to this false deity who, they say, ‘was born for you and died for you’. Spare me from this crap. This comes from the power hungry priesthoods trying to run every facet of your life. They don’t even want you enjoying this holiday season without the guilt of \"jesus is the reason for the season\". This is just not so. The season is ancient and Pagan. The Christians couldn't stop it, so they tried to bully their way into it. In fact, jesus was NEVER the reason for the season, but you need to remove the thumb of religion from your crown chakra to fully realize that. Another thing about this false deity (who is really alien ) is the appearance of this creature - he's an old, white man. For all the complaining blacks do about white attitudes, why do they still worship the white god? If god is white, therefore white must be the race closest to/of god and therefore again, the white races must rule the planet as being closest to deity. This has been what is behind western European conquests throughout history. This is also pure bullshit and one of the reason that priests were sent out with exploring ships. Waving their white god in front of the native locals while showing off their European barbaric power. Get the locals to join our church. These converts then become closer to the god-chosen, master white race and removed from the non-converted. Western European conquerors freely quoted their invented book of rules (bible) to enslave others. Yeah, some of the southern US sects have limply apologized for using the bible to justify slavery, but this doesn't mean that their religion is wrong, only that they used it incorrectly. The mythical jesus was a Hebrew, so he would have had black hair and brown eyes, but what do you see instead? A blue eyed, light brown haired, western European white man. Satan, the mythological lesser deity, however is always red (good excuse to control the Native Americans, I guess). Now look at where the catholics (Orion queen's followers) are - mary worship. There is the legion of maiy and the marianist society, all devoted to the worship of the Queen of Heaven. In the song Hail, Holy Queen (we've all seen it in Sister Act), the first line: \"Hail, holy queen enthroned above\" refers to the Orion queen enthroned above (Mintaka). This song was written by a pope long ago and you better believe the pope's know exactly who their heavenly queen is! She is the central figure in catholic, orthodox (Greek/Russian) religions. It is the Orion queen, mary, and joseph is the Sirian king obedient to mary. You don't hear much about joseph, but mary is all over the place.

You can travel all over the higher densities and never run into any of these mythological beings except on Monroe level 26 and these are simply astral creations of the worshipers throughout the ages, and you can run into just about any deity ever worshiped on Earth on level 26, but not in higher level. There are no ‘angels' and other ‘servants of Earth gods’. It’s amazing how many educated and otherwise savvy people still cling to a belief in mythological deities. As for the priesthoods, their purpose in life is to keep people in line through faith and/or fear. BUT, once you remove the thumb of religion from your life, you will see things far more clearly and priesthoods will have no power over you as you increase the speed of your spiral out of 3rd density Earth. You have no need of god/goddess or other creature to give your power away to. Giving away your power denies your true salvation, connection to your Higher Self. Your Higher Self is the only road to progression FOR YOU. So, enjoy the holiday season, the lights, the candles, etc. I enjoy the music as well and just change the words to the beautiful religious songs (I prefer the instrumentals in these cases). Adapt the season to fit you and your needs. Give thanks to your Higher Self for being in your life and guiding you. ALWAYS look within, not without. Observation: Tis The Season — Holidays Once again it is the BIG holiday season in much of the world. Today it is geared to celebrate a birth that never happened. Yeah, most Earthers just love fairy tales and this one is no exception. Even though the Christians have hijacked this ancient holiday of Yule, the pagan nature of it remains today. If you are a South Park watcher on Comedy Central, you know how the creators just love zapping convention. The movie, South Park Bigger, Longer & Uncut, is an outstandingly iconoclastic effort. However to zap those who allow themselves to be body ruled, check out the South Park Christmas album, Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics. There are many great holiday songs there. Check out track 4: Dead, Dead, Dead. Body ID'd persons will be repulsed at the lyrics. The chorus is: \"Dead, dead, dead, someday you'll be dead. Dead, dead, dead, someday we'll all be dead.\" Wonderful song. Such realistic lyrics. Play this album for your body oriented friends and relatives if you want to see them be uncomfortable. One other festive song on that album that I will mention is track 16: The Most Offensive Song Ever. To a Christian, it most definitely is! Unfortunately, while the lyrics for the other songs are in the liner notes, this one is not. Kenny and Mr Hankey sing a song of fictional jesus’ mother, fictional mary, giving blowjobs because she can remain a virgin by doing so. It is difficult to understand some of what Kenny mumbles, but you can have fun with what you can hear. On the back of the cd, in the lower left, an upside down American flag is placed. The upside down flag indicates a country in distress. This is true. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are two incarnations of Higher Selves having a blast at zapping convention. 205"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"On the other hand, remember what I wrote about adapting what you are taught and making it your own. By the time you are ready for the Matrix 5 materials, you have flushed religion down the toilet, but yet you may still enjoy what you had as a child at the season. There is NO reason why you cannot enjoy it now. Take the icons that gave you pleasure and make them fit who you are now. I have a 6 foot tall, balsam fir in my house with 500 LED, very low wattage, multi-colored lights on it. My house is festive, comfortable and smells like balsam fir. Co-workers have said to me, \"how come you do christmas when you aren't Christian?\". Break those loops and fences that are around you and don't be intimidated by the riff-raff. Even when I use the word 'christmas', it's just a nice sounding word to me that conjures images of decorated trees, wreaths, etc, although if it were pronounced 'christ mass' instead of 'kriss miss', it would be another story. I adapted what works for me. Keep that in mind for yourself. The key to these traditional holidays is to make them yours in a way that is comfortable to YOU and fuck anyone else. The independence you show can really fluster them. One traditional holiday that I don't observe is easter - the fertility festival. All those het sex icons: rabbits, eggs, etc - a breeders festival. No thanks. BUT I still may pick up a white chocolate egg because I like white chocolate. When asked what I'm doing for this day, the answer is 'just another Sunday for me', but that's ME. Just keep in mind, do what YOU feel comfortable with and what makes YOU happy. Triple Ho's for the season! Observation: The Game & One-Godders The catholics are undergoing an exposure that is manipulated by the Game. This is due to the situation where the one-godders have outlived their usefidness to the Game. The Game is attacking BOTH Christians and muslims (one god religions) in different ways. The Game would have you believe that all muslims are terrorists and Christian priesthoods are deviant. Well, there's truth in both thoughts. ALL muslims aren't terrorist, but many are. ALL Christian priesthoods aren't deviant, but many are. The Christian priesthoods have been corrupt since they began. Catamites were the priests' sex toys in the early/middle ages. What is going on with the priests today isn't new. It's ALWAYS been going on with them. The churches say 'don't judge the church by the priests'. BULLSHIT. If they say the priest is 'chosen by god', didn't their god know the priest was a pedophile? What does that say about the god who chooses these people as priests? Remember that to your Christian friends. Also, the main condemnation of the church is that they preach against what they are involved with themselves. Do as I say, not as I do - how very American of them. The same goes for protestant preachers who are thieves, adulterers, etc. IF they were 'chosen by god', what does it say about their god?! One god religions have outlived the Game's usefulness. The way to rid the world of them is to villainize them in the eyes of the people. Since most of the incarnates are minions, they are easily manipulated. The Orion queen intends to reclaim Earth. Ridding Earth of the one god religions, or at the very least, to severely weaken them so they whither on the vine, is being done on purpose. Don't go only by the surface headlines of the news. You must look deeper to find out why. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Is allah a different god? Hell, no. Allah is just arabic for 'god' in english. Why don't they say spanish speakers worship 'dios', french worship 'dieu', polish worship 'boze' (pronounced boh-zheh) and so on? They've been manipulating people for ages and this is just to create an artificial separation. All the one godders worship the same alien being(s) who they call 'god' in whatever language. The hindus worship other aliens from other groups including the one that one godders call ’god’. When you examine the trickery and semantics of the Game, you can see the manipulation of the masses (who are asses) and something we must all evolve (spiritually) beyond. Observation: Separation of Church and State In the US, you hear the phrase ’separation of church & state’ and you are meant to b eLIEve that ‘the tentacles of organized religion are kept at bay by the government’. This is FAR from true, however, with the US based on deception, nothing else should be expected. Here are some examples of the fallacy of the 'separation of church & state': *SEX LAWS: What are most laws based on? Religious viewpoints. Take laws on matters of sexual relations, such as sodomy (Jewish based horseshit), polygamy (christian/jewish horseshit), age of sexual consent (more religious horseshit) and same gender relations (Jewish based horseshit). I've spoken a lot on the gay matter, but sodomy includes both hets and gays. Go to your non-religious dictionary for the definition of sodomy. Sodomy is based on that cockeyed, desert (alien) deities desire that you farm animals have sex for procreation only. Sodom was nuked by a rival alien group and it had nothing to do with sex at all, but the warped nature of those one god religions have perverted that information. It is perversion that generates lies like this in order to control YOU. The polygamy ban, at least in the US, has its origins with the Orion Empire where a female can have multiple male consorts. This applies ONLY to the female. The Sirian Empire is the exact reverse. You can see the Sirian hand in arab countries and in the mormon philosophy. Earth is not yet ready for females to engage in having harems. The attitudes must change first. As the Orion DNA commands continue to have their desired effects on males, the intent is to eventually make the Orion model standard on Earth for those who desire to participate. This is part of the Orion overt conquest of Earth. The mormons never gave up their belief in polygamy. They say it’s only a temporary situation where they must obey the laws of the land. They anticipate Sirian control. This won't happen. Whatever faction has most influence controls what beliefs are reflected in the laws of that land. These are purely religious in nature. Similar religious beliefs influence the 'age of consent'. Most of Europe has 16 as the age when it is legal to engage in sex. In some places it is younger. The key is consent. Body ID'd persons interested in control and power refuse to consider the Law of Allowance in these matters. THAT is their problem. Most teenagers start whoring around earlier than 16. Some start later than that. It's all about consent and control. The teens want to experiment/experience. Adults, refusing to let their children grow up, try to delay the events. What adults should do is explain the consequences of mixed gender sex and what is involved with abortion if they aren't careful.

They should concentrate on explaining sex as a healthy beneficial activity with stress on cleanliness and condoms. Laws based on religious (lack of healthy) sexual attitudes have their foundations in the simultaneous, alien incarnations because they know that sex brings Higher Selves in contact, hence the drains/blocks involved in het sex are part of the DNA commands. Gay/lesbian sex makes them crazy because no such drains/blocks exist here, so it becomes <gasp> evil. While I only cover some sex laws here, examine other laws and look for the claw, uh, hand of 'god'. Wake up from the illusions they so skillfully create and maintain. *OATHS/PLEDGES: \"One nation under god\", swearing on a bible and oaths of office are all performed with religious based vows and always with that damned, alien god sticking a nose into everything. Deity involvement is meant to remind you that you are supposed to be subservient to an external deity. Give your power away since ‘there is a being better than you’, they say. It is all concocted smoke and mirrors by the sequential incarnates to prevent (or at least delay) simultaneous incarnates from discovering their true natures. When you pledge allegiance, swear on a bible or take any oath that involves a 'god', you give your power away. As you can see, these oaths (of office, for example) mean nothing to those who take them. More deception is involved. Currently, in the White House, is a psychopathic megalomaniac who took his oath to defend and protect the constitution from enemies both foreign and domestic. Instead he has proven himself to be a domestic enemy of the constitution. He and his henchmen/women are stripping away rights in the name of an artificially created enemy just as Hitler did in the 30's. Congress doesn't honor its oath and permits this to happen. This can be analyzed all the way down to local political levels. This is because there is the illusion that those in power want to have the populace believe. It's JUST illusion, however. *RELIGIOUS OVERSEERS - Yes, these are known as congressional chaplains, military chaplains and other non-religious groups where they \"open with a prayer\". This is done to keep the 'eye of god' (and you know what that means by now) or, at the very least, make you beLIEve that ‘some god is watching the proceedings’. Tax moneys pay for chaplains to perform their voodoo in places that they still say 'separation of church and state'. Where's the separation? Chaplains should be removed. If anyone wants to go to church, they are all over like saloons. Indulge in your Game habits as much as you want to, there. Separation of church and state - not hardly. The current Attorney General of the US is living proof of church controlling state in a nazified way. It's only going to get worse before it gets better. Observe and analyze. Look for the deceptions and find the person behind the curtain to really understand the nature of 3rd density Earth in EndGame.

Two-Part Big Leap In order to enter the New Reality and participate in its creation, those who wish to MUST take the Big Leap, and it has 2 parts: 1. You MUST realize that ALL religions are control devices that have vou looking elsewhere for 'salvation'. This includes: muslim, hindu, the all evil Christianity, wicca, paganism and any other religion that has you give away your power to a deity (god OR goddess). Not only must you realize this, BUT also act on it by ending external worships/devotions. Proof is in the action more than the word. You must reclaim your power. As magic is not a religion, this is not included for obvious reasons. However, as the Frosts always say, wicca and paganism are nature RELIGIONS, not magic religions. It's just that wiccans/pagans are open to using magic. 2. After Part l, you MUST come to realize that vou create vour destinies. You MUST drop the victim attitude of 'it’s everyone else's fault that I am in this situation'. We live in a country of victims today. There will be no victims in the New Reality. You MUST take control of self. If you smoke, for example, don't blame the tobacco companies, stress or whatever. YOU decided to take up that #i psychic inhibiting habit. It's YOUR fault. Non- smokers have stress too and we don't smoke. Don't whine about little or no psychic abilities if you are the cause of this inhibition because of a nasty drug habit you freely decided to take up. Yes, alcohol and other drugs are also problems, but the tobacco problem is the biggest/widest used. Yes, the government/Dark side is behind it, but you STILL had your free will to decide to take up the filthy habit. So, you deny all religions have control over you. You take back vour power and vou look within (to vour Higher Self) for guidance/assistance. Use the mantra \"I am a human becoming. Help me to become\". Use (think) it often. It REALLY helps. Rituals Rituals , as stated in Handbook III, are used by religions and secret societies to control a person and to remind the person of his or her 'place'. Religion loves rituals: Go to church every Sunday or GO TO HELL (catholic), for example* ALL religions, both structured and unstructured have rituals to continually remind the followers (correct term for sheep) that they are subject to the whims and moods of their deity AND that they are not to think themselves anything but subservient to that deity. \"It's a sin to ask that question\" I was told more than once in catholic school. 'You have to accept that without question and just because 'god' says so\". Bullshit, but it does keep the vast majority of the sheep in line - fear of their deity. Rituals, continually practiced, will train the person to be subservient to the deity the ritual is geared to, whether it be jesus, 'god', 'goddess', allah, krishna, buddah or whoever. Kneeling, bowing, using phrases like 'the lord says', 'god says' or 'in god's name' or 'god willing' are all ways to show that someone else has control over your life. These beings only have control over your life IF you chose to give away your power to them. If you chose to reclaim or to retain your power, they have no power over you. The ritual of 'the lord says'...notice how it's always THE lord instead of my lord. If someone wants to have a master, that's fine, but keep him to yourself. It is proper to say 'my lord', in that case, but never accurate to say 'the lord'. 'Our lord' is only accurate when talking to others in the MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 209"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"same group of sheep. However, notice that it is a ritual to say that...a ritual to remind you that you are subservient to another being. People who have reclaimed their power have NO lords or ladies for they are a deity unto themselves. When someone sneezes, what do they say? “god bless you”. This is also a ritual. It's been several years now that I've been telling people not to say that to me when I sneeze. It throws them all for a loop. Why? Because I've interrupted a ritual and refuse to give the expected response to it. The incredulity, the shocked looks...you DARE interrupt a ritual ... for...'god'!?! Yep. The 'god' of this world, no matter what name(s) you may give for this deity, has no place in my life. I do not give away my power. However if you seek to have a 'god' in your life, please help yourself, just don't try to include me. Another common ritual, crossing/blessing one's self upon hearing/seeing something uncomfortable to one's belief system. The crossing ritual reinforces that 'god' is in control of you and will decide what you should be doing. It's like waving garlic at a vampire, theoretically, and by crossing one's self, that person is keeping the unwanted energy away. Geez, forbid that what the person hears or sees might awaken him/her to question the belief system. Baptism is another ritual practiced by many religions in some form or another. Baptism is an initial and initiatory ritual of giving one's power away to a 'god' and acknowledging that the person cannot save himself and needs an external savior. The use of water, sprinkling, pouring or dumping in is symbolic, not of the stated washing away of ‘sins’ (which don't exist), but of washing away your responsibility for your own salvation. Be my shepherd...I will follow...I will obey...just tell me. Talk about avoiding responsibility. Another ritual involves quoting from the bible to justify your actions instead of admitting self-responsibility. \"The bible says...\", \"jesus said...\", \"paul said...\" - this said/that said...but what do YOU say? People must toss this control device and take responsibility for themselves. Not he said/she said, but <I> say, <I> decided, <I> discerned, etc. The ritual of confession to 'god' is another control device that busybody priests and ministers can really get off on. Get your sins forgiven. Yeah, right, as Robert Monroe said, there is no sin, no good nor evil, just different experiences. Exactly. Learn from your mistakes or you'll repeat them. Ask for forgiveness from someone you've hurt, but not from some damned deity. There is no such thing as sin. There are only experiences that help you grow and mature. The ritual of communion - “eat my flesh and drink my blood”. Very cannibalistic, whether literally as with catholics, orthodox and Henry the 8th's church, or symbolic as with Iutherans and other protestants. Cannibalism is cannibalism. The ritual is reptilian in origin; sacrificing to the blood thirsty reptilian 'god' to appease him. The reptilian 'god' is still around and is the 'god' people all pray to DESPITE what they may otherwise think. The reptilian wears the mask of 'god the father', 'allah', etc, but take away the mask and watch the forked tongue flick. Secret society rituals are quite complex. Included are the masons, the mormon temple endowment ceremonies, Skull & Bones Society and many others. The rituals are used to bind the membership in obedience. Repeating the rituals is for reminding the membership of what is expected of them and not to become independent of the rules. In the mormon endowment ritual, at one point in the fdm, Satan turns to the people and says (while a light MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Bullshit! While religions and secret societies have scads of rituals, there are also plenty to be found in the government as well. The government “knows what’s best”. Give away your power and then more of your power and independence so.that the government will give you a controlled life with few upsets and challenges. Look how many run to the government or other authority figure (boss, supervisor, etc) to solve their problems instead of working on a solution themselves. Every petty, minor thing that comes up...they run to 'daddy' to make it go away. You can never learn until/unless you accept responsibility and find solutions. \"He said something I didn’t like, so I complained to authority.\" \"He's not doing what 1 think he should, so I complained to authority.\" \"She gave me a dirty look, so I complained to authority.\" When are these people ever going to reclaim their power and grow up? These are just a few examples of ritual. Look at the rituals in your life. Look for those that give your power away to any other person, place or thing. Examine why you do it. Do you HAVE to do it? If you respond, but 'god'/government/society expects it...then you're doing it for the wrong reason - conformity. \"I'd do it, but what would everyone think?\" <SIGH> Do it! More on the Sneezing Ritual This ritual of the phrase given to someone who has just sneezed is one of the most common rituals in every day life. Why is it used? On the surface, it's a myth formed centuries ago when people were told that part of their essence leaves the body on sneezing. A counter point, more current on the time line, says that the heart stops on the sneeze. Both are incorrect, but what better way for religion to grasp on something that people feared by tossing their deity in to further enhance domination by 'god'? Even in this time, when people know what a sneeze is and isn't, why do they continue to say 'god bless you'? Mindless ritual restating your subservience to a deity. Why 'god bless you' and not 'bite the wall'...or better yet, why anything at all? And why is an expulsion of air from your nose w r orthy of the ritual and not a fart or a burp? Doesn't your 'god' fart or burp? Yes, the deity does when you know who the deity is behind the mask he wears. One person, who knows who the deities really are, says he still likes to say 'bless you' because it sounds so nice. Geez, talk about programming. In order to break from control by the deities (and who they REALLY are), you must stop using the rituals approved by them. Since sneezing has nothing to do with death knocking at your door, why do you still say it (if you do)? If you simply can't summon up the courage to break the rules and stop saying it, why not say 'I bless you'. But, that makes me 'god'! Think about it! But that's a SIN to think you aren't a slave of'god'. Bullshit! I favor not saying anything when someone sneezes and have been in this mode for a few years now. Mindless phrases are a waste of energy. When I'd sneeze and someone says the phrase, I use to say, 'which god?'. That'd get them. My suggestion is if it happens in public and you sneeze, ignore any use of the ritual to you. If someone else sneezes, ignore it too. Life goes on. Now, if you're asked why you didn't participate in the ritual subservience to 'god', (which isn't likely in public), then you can say why.

Now, if I sneeze and someone I know performs the ritual on me, I tell them ’please don't say that ritual to me, I find that very offensive'. Talk about getting the looks. Why? Because you've interrupted a ritual to deity, you've broken the pattern and once the pattern starts to break down, it spreads. Reptilian Commands and the Sheeple Since I learned some things, I NEVER go to weddings or birthing events. I'll share some of the reasons why with you, especially since I shared some info on the gender abomination created by the reptilian genetic scientists. Weddings are a continuation of the reptilian coJitrol started on ancient Earth. The bible (reptilian command doctrine today) tells how only those 2 genetic flaws - man and woman - that 'god' (read reptilian master) has joined, let no man put asunder. It also says by these 2 joining, “they are now as 1.” That is a lie and a deception telling them “this is the only way to return” to being the original single type human of ancient Earth. Hell and damnation if you don't follow this warning. All this shit, if you don't obey the reptilian deities. Since those ancient times, it has become custom, BUT the genetic code in hets and most bi's still pulses to the reptilian command. It even screws up many gay physical bodies wanting gay marriage, showing this part of the DNA code to be present in many, but not all, gays. This is why most women think they HAVE to get married and why most men think they HAVE to 'settle down'. They are obeying the reptilian master of their physical bodies. This is why the public 'look down their noses’ by the obedient masses to those who don't follow this command and either remain single or just live together. If you find someone you enjoy being with...why marriage? For 'official' (reptilian) sanction. This sanction has little lures to it in terms of ‘benefit shares’ by the partner with medical coverage. Well, domestic partnership laws are changing that. Monogamy is also a reptilian command. When people get married, they want to know they 'did the right thing', so they make a big to-do over it and EXPECT to be congratulated for it and rewarded with gifts. This also goes back to reptilian commands for acceptance. If one doesn't support this horrible event (thinking on a different scale), those who do are shaking their heads. IF you do attend a wedding, you are giving your seal of approval to the event and your agreement to it. I believe they should live together, NOT get married, so I will not ‘certify’ the event in any way other than a sympathy card, if so moved. Astrologically, it moves the relationship from the 5th house of lovers to the 7th house of enemies ... and then you want to know why so many marriages fail and why there is so much infidelity (but that also bring up the subject of forced monogamy ). The mormon church considers any man over 25 a \"threat to society\" if they aren't married by this age. Thank you for these kinds of threats. You can see they speak for their reptilian masters. Then there's command #2...breed like roaches! The Mormons don't consider you to have completed your 'duty' to 'god' until you breed. The command to breed is to increase the population to provide the reptilians with a larger FOOD source, labor pool and potential fodder for their continual wars and expansions. Married people who don't breed are looked down on. I know one Earth Life Addict who felt he HAS to breed. This is his physical DNA commands overpowering his weaker spirit. The reptilian master is pleased. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

MATRIX V: The Gold Edition All these “congratulations for breeding” are similar to those for marriage... certifying the deed. I do NOT congratulate breeders for fulfilling their master's commands. If you want to do it, don't try to involve my acceptance, cause it’s not there to give. Yet, for Earth system involvement, we ALL must go through the marriage and breeding cycles. This is part of the learning process for bevond Earth cycles. However, when you get to a Final incarnation, you may get this information (some of which I'm sharing with you) so you can get some advanced perspectives before your last goodbye to the prison planet. 99.9% if you won't be ready for this stuff until AFTER your Higher Self has finished with 3rd density incarnating.

Observations: Origin of the Custom of Kneeling to Another Some examples, on Earth, of kneeling to another person are: ‘*Submissive statement to authority/dominant figure, such as conquered soldiers kneeling on the ground before victors; someone involved in some serious begging; cops (take it one step further) by making people prostrate on the ground. ■’‘'Submissive statement to deities such as kneeling to 'god' in church. On one's knees to 'gods' has been going on for millennia. *The marriage proposal where a man kneels to a woman. You can probably think of others, but the bottom line is that kneeling to another is a form of submission. The origin of kneeling to another has its origins in the Orion Empire. Ancient Earthers (pre-gender split) never knelt for this reason. Enter the Orion/Sirian Empires (story in Matrix 5) and their declaration of being deities and kneeling was introduced on Earth. This is an ancient practice in the Empire as well. Since females overthrew male dominance eons ago in the Orion Empire, males have been required to kneel to the female when asking some major event of her. This kneeling to females was required of males in European traditions, especially royalty which is heavily reptilian. This had been carried to even more ridiculous stages, such as men standing when a woman entered the room, men surrendering their seat for a woman, men taking off their hat to a woman, men altering their speech patterns when a woman 'is present' and so on. All this female catering is a direct result of reptilian Orion culture on Earth. This special status/inequality with western females spread like a plague wherever Europeans went and attempts were made to impose these alien rituals on others with a mixed bag of success. NO ONE should ever kneel to anyone else for these purposes. Kneeling indicates submission. If a man insists on marrying a woman, he should NOT kneel to her like an Orion slave or an Orion male. Tradition, they say. Yeah, a tradition that began in the Mintaka system. Kneeling is placing your head below the other signifying that person is above you. Remember in the King & I how the Thai king demanded that no one's head be higher than his. Kneeling to a woman or man signifies that the one you kneel to is superior to you. This higher head stuff is also carried on by people wearing hats, tiaras, crowns, and other head pieces. (Although the crown is a take-off on the horns surrounding royal reptilian heads.) 213"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"This ritual is not going to stop on its own because authority figures are polarity control people and feel superior to everyone else. Females (Western) feel that they are superior (DNA commands) and will insist on more types of submissions by Earther males whose DNA commands will force submission. The only bright spot in this garbage is that 3rd density Earth is nearing its conclusion and all the crap associated with it will be ending, at least for the Earth planetary spirit. So the next time you see a man kneel to a woman for her 'favor', just think Orion whipped. Remember these things when you continue your observations of the fall of Earther humans. Game Traps: Ancestor Worship & Genealogy In Asia, ancestor worship/reverence is a tradition. Genealogy began with royals (Orion Empire lackies) showing their lineage and, thus, their 'right' to be in power. Genealogy today is a main pursuit of the mormon church. Other than the royals (hence alien motivated), why is this falling over ancestors so important? Because The Game wants you to identify with your body and not your spirit, the true you. If you get hung up (and we ALL do in low and mid level incarnations, even into mid-Advanced levels) on the physical line and your false obligations to that line, you will never view yourself as an incarnation of your Higher Self inhabiting ALL human races on Earth in time periods selected by your Higher Self for specific and general experiences required by your Higher Self. You feel obligated to do/say things because of the family/clan/dynasty,etc. You are told to do these things BECAUSE of your physical line. This is drilled into you as a strong part of The Game to keep you asleep. If you KNEW that the line is nothing but to provide a vehicle for your incarnation, you might not go to war, get married to the 'right' person, breed to prescribed dictates or carry on body-oriented, ancient grudges passed on from generation to generation. Knowing you are an incarnation from your Higher Self, you recognize that you are in all these other experiences that The Game says you must ‘like’ or ‘dislike’. If you are reading this material, you are an arab/african/european/asian/native american, etc, as you are a catholic/protestant/muslim/hindu/buddhist,etc. If you are all these people at different times, you understand why and would never war with yourself. However by now you should have gained the wisdom and reason to act significantly different that when you were a mid­ level incarnation. Carrying on traditions-for your physical becomes insignificant unless you just enjoy a particular tradition. For example, I decorate at Christmas time, but am not a religious of any sort. I have adapted that holiday to fit me but have NO religious figures connected to the Christian subversion of the original yule period. Yet, I have zip to do with easter, which is nothing more than the ancient fertility festivals with religious overtones (fuck like rabbits then praise jesus crap). Fertility festivals are for breeders, not me. Adapting something to fit you is a mid-Advanced and above trait. They may say, \"If you don't honor the ancestors\" or \"If you don't do your genealogy\" you will suffer some unnamed fate. I remember once, when I was in Utah, a woman asked me (in a laundromat) if I had done my genealogy. I told her 'no'. She said she knew someone who had completed his back to 'Adam'. Yeah, right. The mormons want people to do genealogy because the aliens are looking for descendants of specific lines. This is why they record/computerize all genealogical information sent to Salt Lake City and store it in the mountain vaults with access to alien bases underneath.

Orion DNA Commands — “Higher Education” In Time magazine, Dec u,200o, a special report on education: The MALE Minority reveals that the enrollment of men has fallen to 44% of undergrads. The articles says that some social critics \"blame a dearth of male role models among school teachers and a culture that promotes anti-intellectualism among boys\". According to an education analyst in Iowa, \"the share of college degrees earned by males has been declining for decades\". All of this while the enrollment of females has continued to rise strongly since the early 8o's. The higher education of females must occur for Orion purposes, the same as the decline of male higher education is needed. The Orion DNA commands continue to manifest. The Orion goal of female dominance on Earth fits in with the Mintaka model. Submission to the female by the male is required when Earth fully rejoins the Orion Empire after a long period apart and under the rebel queen. Males are for the amusement/pleasure of the dominant female, a total role reversal of the former centuries. As stated previously, the wail of gender equality was never the goal but rather the excuse to become dominant. This could never have come about if the DNA command was only in female bodies. A companion command had to be in male bodies. Education is necessary to develop minds beyond menial roles. This has been known for ages. Now it is not because men are being denied education, but not choosing to be educated. THIS is the DNA command in action. They want their sports and low level amusements, but resist any real mental development. This is increasing and the Time article brings it to light. Most will say it’s ok, but Final and very Advanced Incarnations will see it as another blight in the plan to suppress the male gender on Earth. What can be done about this? Really, only a powerful spirit (Final or VERY Advanced) incarnating a body can override the DNA commands. We are nearing the end of an era and, fortunately, the Orion DNA commands will not be allowed to fully come in force. The 2012 date is one of the key ones. Many Final Incarnations are here at this time due to the unique situation on Earth - the swan song of Orion/Sirian meddling. Just when it seems they have it all, it'll all be snatched from them. Some clues to this exist in Monroe's books. Regain your power and prepare to spiral out IF it's your time to do so. Obeying The Orion DNA Call Michael Moore’s book, 'Stupid White Men', has some excellent commentary and some damning/Orion commentary. He has one chapter condemning the entire white race throughout time. Racial variety is one of the hallmarks of an Earther Higher Self experience. Each race has individual positive and negative traits. THIS SERVES A PURPOSE FOR EARTHER HIGHER SELVES which need the various races for differing incarnational experiences. This chapter in his book is called, \"Kill Whitey\". Moore's hatred at the white race for fulfilling its role in the Game is part of the sequential aliens' attempts to force conformity.

All Rights Reserved. In another chapter of this book, ’The End of Men', Moore blames men for all the ills of the world and absolves women of any guilt. This is PURE Orion DNA command in the male of today. It is SO pure that the Orion queen would be proud of him. In this chapter, Moore falls into the common mythological trap of calling the planetary spirit 'mother nature’ and claiming that this spirit is attempting to eliminate all men from the planet. This, of course, is PURE bullshit. Refer to M5 for comments on the fairy tale being called 'mother nature'. The planetary spirit would act against Earthers as a unit, but not against only one gender, of whom Moore is totally in error in blaming. He believes that the plague of female births on Earth these days is 'mother nature' way of removing males. This is an Orion DNA thing (timed for now) and has nothing to do with the planetary spirit. In true Orion DNA obedience, Moore says, \"Truth be told, I am a better person for having lived my life surrounded by stong, intelligent and loving women\". They are perceived, by this type of male, as 'loving' because he allows himself to be dominated and manipulated by them. Note this comment in the same chapter: \"Whatever frightening male habits were not exercised by my sisters and mother, these two (wife & daughter) have been merciless in finishing off.\" \"Frightening\"? To whom?? Pussy whipped, Orion DNA driven male! This chapter rambles on blaming men for every possible problem that he could think of. Hell forbid you should also be a white male! He IS but, like Robert Morning Sky, he is in sackcloth & ashes over being male. This, again, is Orion reptilian in origin. The chapter is filled with some truth, numerous half-truths and many outright lies due, most likely, personal research lacking. I was wondering why such an attack book on Bush & his controllers could come out in these days. Well, I've discovered why and I'm just 1/2 way through the book. It is anti-white, anti­ man, elevates females to near goddess staure and, thusly, serves the divisive, polaric, alien DNA agendas. As long as he serves purposes like that, he’ll remain around even if he does tweak fascist segments of the country. When you have reached Very Advanced stages, you will be able to quickly discover where someone is coming from. Harper Collins, a major, mainstream publisher, put Moore's book out because it serves a polaric purpose. IF it wasn’t for Val and his tiny Leading Edge, Matrix 5 would have never been published. Luckily, Val's Higher Self was a major part of the M5 project. Orion Influence and the Removal of Hats (Special Gold Edition Segment) Why has it always been that men have been expected to remove their hats at certain occasions, such as in a church, at a funeral or when meeting a woman? Why is it that women never remove their hats for any such occasion? The wearing of head gear seems to have been with us always. There are the protective reasons such as a helmet (military or sports) or to help ward off the cold or rain. There are ornamental hats, religious hats and so on. With military helmets, Roman Empire being a good example, that have the scrub brush tops or similar - this is a reference to the Orion military with the tops of their heads having a crest of scales. Where this variation exists on ornamental military headwear, it is an imitation of the reptilian military. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 216"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. High hats (favored by the Roman church in popes, bishops and certain kings) are meant to give the impression of superiority to their followers or their common people. These also have alien ties in their origins. Crown and tiaras have their origins with the Orion royals as well due to their formation of horns on their heads in a circular pattern. Of course the Orion royals also enhance their horn protrusions, but, nevertheless, this is where crowns and tiaras have their origin. Back to the original questions at the start of this segment. Why are men expected to remove their hats when women are not? This is due to the Orion Empire where females rule and males are very second class. The removal of the hat is a symbolic acknowledgement of the superiority of the female rule, hence men have always been expected to take off their hat when meeting a woman. This was happening on Earth even when men were in full control. It was a practice of European Earther royalty (part of the chivalry nonsense) to mirror Orion mannerisms, although the original reason for doing this was known to a relative few. When the Orion Empire was openly on Earth, the newly formed humans had to incorporate Orion customs as much as they could. These became traditions even after the changes that followed. As far as men taking their hats off in church - since the Orion queen and Sirian king are the 'gods’ of Earth, men must show respect for them by removing their hats. This is a symbol of subservience. And, why don't the women take off their hats? Because the Orion females dominate the Sirian Empire. The Sirian king bows to the Orion queen. In a microcosmic form, the Earther male bows to the Earther female, especially today when the Orion DNA commands are SO active in much of the world especially in the USA, Canada and Western Europe. Remember these things if you are a hat wearer and be aware of the real reasons of these 'traditions'. Sexual Prisoners The talk radio today was discussing a known Hollywood personality's comment that she refuses to have sex with her husband any more. To this several other women called in to agree. OK, if you don't want sex any more, then your husband is free to find it elsewhere. No? Well, if you won't give him what he needs and refuse to allow him to get it elsewhere, you’re guilty of having someone as a sexual prisoner. This is the reverse of using someone for sex by instead keeping him from having sex. With a male, if there's no sex, there's no romance. This is a further development of the Orion DNA command to be at the female's whim. A man should not put up with this Pampered Cow Syndrome. All she's doing is living off you all at her control. If you don't have the spirit to throw the cunt out and make her earn her own living, you probably deserve what you are getting. It's all a learning process, after all. This control is one of the main reasons why I'm against marriage. Women use it as a license to control a man's life (today) more than the other way around. This is why I do not attend ANY weddings, either het or gay. Why gays want to imitate hets by getting married is a beyond me. As I've said earlier, marriage is a control device originating with the Orion genetic scientists when they divided Earthers into genders. The perversion of marriage, unfortunately continues today, but is far less 'sacred' than in the past.

More marriages are broken (they should have a picture of the wedding photo in the divorce columns). In the name of ’love' (read instead 'lust'), people form unions that, in the majority of cases, rapidly disintegrates when the sex becomes routine. This problem wouldn't exist if they just lived together for as long as they wished, then went their separate ways once done. Ancient Earthers had no such trap as “marriage”. In most cases, it's the controlling nature of the female that gets in the way. In some remnants of the Sirian system, it's the male's controlling. The Sirian system (in the US) has been rapidly giving way to the Orion system with the impending return of the queen. This, unfortunately, gives us countless 'queens' here waiting for their mistress (unknowingly). Under the innocent-seeming guise of 'equality', females have bullied their way into dominance and have broken down society. When women were real women, the country had FAR fewer problems since they raised the family and created a home. Due to Orion DNA commands, females desire to be males (but yet retain the status of females) have caused much of the chaos in the country today. This is not something that can be corrected. In the interesting book, Surrendered Woman, the female author tries to reverse the Orion commands. In the book, The War Against Boys, another author tries to bring to light the effects of the Orion commands. While these, and other, efforts are interesting, they will prove to be futile. The control/dominance/me-first machine known as woman will not reverse. The evening news shows how American style feminism is spreading like a doomsday virus into China, India and Nepal. The Orion DNA command will cover the Earth, if unchecked by the upcoming Events. There can be no return to the past. The past is gone. However the horrors of a female dominated Earth will not be realized either, thank Destiny. We are in the darkness of 3rd density Earth. The darkness will be banished, but it'll get darker before the dawn in the next several years. Once this is ALL wiped away, only then can matters be put right. The Orion plan is, fortunately, doomed to fail. Neither will the Sirian plan reassert itself. It will be a whole NEW era. One that will banish forever the horrid state of affairs Earth has known since the Orion genetic scientists started their meddling on Earth. The keeping of sexual prisoners by females or males will end one way or another as will other crimes against the Higher Self. One reason we, with Higher Selves, are here - to learn from the terrible errors/experiences on Earth so they won't be recreated in your individual Higher Selfs future when you choose to create worlds.

Here's a mini-list showing what is sent for which occasion based on body or on AWAKENED spirit orientation in the current time period: BODY - Congratulations: Birth, Wedding, Engagement, Graduation, Religious event AWAKENED SPIRIT - Congratulations: Death, Divorce, Separation, Graduation FROM religious control BODY - Sympathy: Death AWAKENED SPIRIT - Sympathy: Wedding, Birth, Engagement, Baptism, or other religious event Of course those who are body ruled will fail to understand the “Why’s” for this list. Once they are awakened, they WILL not only understand, but also agree! Other Reptilian Commands All reptilian commands to their Earth gender slaves deal with divide and conquer. It is to their benefit that the division increases to keep fighting internal and not to the source of the problem - the reptilians themselves and their lackeys. Organized religions are one of their prime hate-generator s. Using today's organized religions, the reptilian 'god' of the bible commanded the Israelis to conquer and kill many times. In one case, 'god' was so mad that the Israelis DIDN'T kill enough (they were supposed to kill ALL cattle and people) that the 'god' threw a ‘hissy fit’ through his prophet. “In the name of god” has been used to start wars for no other reason than people had different attitudes. This 'god' also fights on both sides. Look at WWI where 'god' was “helping” both sides. It's true, because this 'god' is the reptilian master in whose interest it is to keep Earthers divided. Imagine what it'd be if more people refused to fight. Some did during the Vietnam war, and see what ridicule was heaped on them for going to Canada. Today, the reptilian lackeys of media are trying to stir up more violence in places like East Timor, \"They're killing catholics!\" was heard on TV many times. The continuing violence in Northern Ireland is Christian vs. Christian. You don't hear the TV cry \"they're killing catholics\" or \"they’re killing protestants\", do you?

MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition case, it's muslim and, with the US/England being primarily Christian dominated, they plav the song that they know will work best to stir up fear, anger and a desire for revenge, all of which involve reptilian and Dark side emotions that feed the 4th density reptilians. In the US, the division goes further than religion: it's race, sexual orientation, clothing, income levels, hair lengths/styles, voting preferences, neighborhoods, gangs, and just about any other differences you can think up. Instead of celebrating diversity, they condemn lack of conformity, but still claim that America is the “land of the free.” Yeah, right. The Christians think that means only they are free to spread their religious poison for the reptilians and that “no other religion” has that “right”. The Christians want everyone to be like them. Why not be happy being what you are? Misery loves company! What tactics are used? Fear (hell, devils, death) is the prime method of conversion and control, once in the fold. These are reptilian tactics. Generate that fear to feed the 4th density reptilians. The dramas have increased to a maddening crescendo. In order to spiral out of here, you need to cut yourself off from participating in the reptilian orchestrated dramas. Observe, take note, but restrain from being swept up in the tidal wave of fear. What's the worst that can happen (according to what most people think)? The body dies. So, what! The spirit lives on. There is no hell, no heaven. All that is a lie to control the masses. There is an eternal progression, new experiences, new knowledge and new places to explore completely different than Earth. The 4th density reptilians won't be hanging around you or your home if there's no fear being generated. They'd starve. But in homes caught up in the dramas, such as school shootings, murders and other TV channeled, fear causing dramas - people generating the fear are putting out a dinner invitation to the 4th density reptilians and they NEVER turn down a free meal. Robert Monroe, in Ultimate Journey, said that any attempts to remake, the Earth into a different model will be met with failure because this is the wav it's supposed to be at this time. This is what it needs to be so that those incarnating here can gain a wide variety of experiences. Earth WILL regain its pristine condition, but only after cataclysmic changes. There IS a progression to what is happening. It WILL all change, but not peacefully. It will change rather dramatically. There i s fear from Light-siders over this. The reptilians thank you for that fear. The changes should not be looked at with fear. You are NOT vour physical body. Your physical body is only an extension of you, your “Halloween costume” of this incarnation. The lie that “you're ONLY HUMAN” is a reptilian deception, as is “you only have one life”. You only have one life as Bill or Betty, but will have MANY others as Lou or Phyllis or Jim or whatever. Close out the noise of the reptilian propaganda machines and their lackeys. Go within and find your truth. It's there. A Deeper Look — New Age Religions New Age religions have been gaining ground in recent years while the outdated mythologies of Christianity are on the decline, although not gracefully! The New Age religions are tolerant of a wide range of beliefs and sexual orientations. On the surface, these new beliefs look great and are a tremendous improvement over guilt ridden, blood and pain drenched Christianity. On the Travel Channel's Lonely Planet series, the traveler to the Baltic states commented positively on the upsurge of pagan religions especially in Lithuania, for example. 220"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Move past the surface relief that New Age religions bring to people who are sick of Christian oppression and look at root beliefs from a standpoint of spirit as opposed to body. New Age religions, like the one god religions, encourage the cornerstone of the Game - that two genders exist beyond the 3rd density into the higher densities all the way up to a polarity of god and of goddess. They also believe in a female (godess) superiority while paying lip service to the male (god). This is from the Orion Empire where the female dominates the male in all phases of social, religious and political areas. The movement from male dominated religions to female is necessary, from the Orion perspective, at this time as the Orion Empire has immediate plans to subjugate Earth into their Empire overtly for the first time since Orion and Sirian genetic science created genders on Earth. Therefore, it is necessary for those who are their body to conform to the queen's will. The catholic church, the most pagan of the Christians, has done much to prepare the way by its worship of the mythological mary goddess. The feminist movement, with its Orion input, has used the false banner of gender equality to rapidly advance its secret agenda of female superiority. Consider that for a while... Both of these elements (plus others including a desire to be free from repressive Christianity) have given New Age religions a tremendous boost. The wiccan revival, Dianic traditions and modern paganism, while allowing for greater expression, have increased the genderization of the spirit to heights never seen. Yes, they are similar to the oldest religions of post-Atlantis, but now the control and center is female, the Orion model and this has bled into all areas of Western life with its core in the US and Canada. The same goes for the mass 'training' in shamanic areas. This very commercial training is part of the New Age religion plans. Students are taught of the genderization of ALL spirits (male and female guides, 'Mother' Earth, 'Mother Nature, etc). They are taking people, with much glitz and glamour, into the female domination. This mass shamanism is not true shamanism. It's also like Americans bull in a china shop approach to the astral. This can get these students into significant trouble and open gates to the unwanted. Sounds like more Orion manipulation! It serves Orion's agenda and that’s why it is permitted and encouraged. This is not true shamanism. The New Age religion is the newest cage for the spirit, the real you. By keeping you occupied with this 'new' mythology, it will become difficult to see spirit as it is, a single, non­ polarized intelligent being. Not a yin/yang model showing male/female equal but separate, but rather the perfect blending of yin/yang before it was artificially separated. Dead people carry the 'I am my body' into the 4th density astral where they cling to their 3rd density, physical identity, male or female. They try to continue the Game on the astral. If you are your body on the astral without knowing who you really are, you will eagerly choose reincarnation. If you, while incarnated, know who you are AND act accordingly by not playing in the Game unless necessary (examples: creating children, marriage and the 'need' for the opposite gender - all mainstays of the Game), you can move beyond the Game forever. This is the Final Incarnation. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 221"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"As in the Roman Empire, they didn't care what deities you worshipped as long as you did worship. The variety of deities, headlined by 'the goddess' (read Orion queen), keeps your attention focused on the external and for external salvation. Never forget, the Game requires you to be your body, look for external salvation and that you are nothing without deity. In reality, once you do discover who you really are in your Final Incarnation, the Game has no power over you nor do those who play the Game, for you are ready to move beyond the Game and the Game's creators. The New Age religions will not allow the discarding of individual genders. It's in their pantheons and ceremonies. These deities, like those of ALL religions, are to be worshipped, obeyed and pacified. To find your Real Self, you must move beyond all religions, for each religions is another trap. Each is a different cage for your spirit. Pagan/New Age Deities (Special Gold Edition Segment) In several segments of Matrix 5 ,1 refer to mainstream religious deities as having their roots in alien visitors. It is also necessary to know what applies to pagan/new age deities as well, especially since this is where the One World people would like to steer Earthers. I studied with the wiccans for several years in the 8o's. It's an ancient religion generally based in striving for harmony with the planetary spirit, wrongly referred to as \"mother\" Earth. The planetary spirit is, like we are, both male AND female, so \"mother\" Earth is a misnomer and an Orion oriented term. This stems from the idea that 'we all came from the mother' which is a reference to us all coming from the Empire 'mother' or, more correctly, the reptilian queen as the genetic scientists told Ancient Earthers. To understand the true nature of spirit is reflected in the terms one uses. If you feel you need to whine/complain about that, you might as well close this book because you are not ready for Matrix 5 at this stage of your progression. I have just read a Jan/Feb 03 editorial by a major wiccan female leader. In it she is all aflutter about certain wiccans who dare \"think that they are stronger or wiser than a god- ess\". <GASP!> All deities of Earth are based on alien beings depending on the pantheon and type of aliens active at that place/time in Earth's history. It may be Greek, Egyptian, Celtic, Norse, Chinese, etc but they are still based on aliens who interacted with Earthers ages ago. The worship of these aliens continued via the priesthoods after they left the planet. Earthly followers, under priestly rule, prayed to images of what they believed were deities. In doing so, they created astral images of these gods/goddesses. It is the astral forms of these beings that continue to store the energies of their worshippers who are, in reality, their gods. This is due to the powerful incarnational spirits creating them in their minds. When a wiccan calls on the power of a god or goddess, they are tapping this energy which resides on Monroe level 25. I have been to the Greek and pantheon on 25 as well as briefly to the Chinese. These astral creations look just like the worships believe them to look like. The Greeks are particularly impressive looking. Without continued input from worshippers, these astral constructs would eventually fade into free flowing energy. It's the will of the worshippers that gives them life and holds their form. So, to answer the question given by the wiccan leader, by one who knows the true nature of the deities, the answer is a resounding 'yes'. You ARE stronger than a god-ess since YOU are one of many who created that form. You ARE also wiser because the image cannot be more than what the energy of the creator-followers are.

The wiccan leader's admonition goes further and swoons at people in circles who \"demand Their presence\". Note the capital T in their. She urges her readers to \"respectfully ask Them to observe\". Note the capital T again. Capitalizing deities and the pronouns referring to them indicates superiority of them to you. Honor, like respect, is earned, not given. This is one reason why I never capitalize these astral creations' nouns/pronouns. If you defer to the astral creation, you are giving away your power to them. \"Offer them the respect that is their due.\" Oops, she forgot to capitalize the T’s in that sentence. The 'respect' that an astral creation is due is no more than the 'respect' that you would give any other creation you might make such as a sand castle, clay figure or stick figure. When interacting with nature spirits, you should act differently than with the god-esses of religion. These beings are indeed real and part of the Earth planetary spirit. You don't command them, but may work with them if you are in certain new age religions and wicca. They are NOT deities but are on par with simultaneous incarnates in so far as they all are expressions of the planetary spirit. Working with these beings is common in certain lower through mid-Advanced levels. You will Advance beyond this stage, but it can assist certain Higher Self incarnations to remember/discover who they really are. This is the shamanic experience for those Higher Selves who choose it. The real Advancement comes from moving beyond the shamanic path after having immersed yourself in it. This hat-in-hand approach that the wiccan leader wants to see is just another form of giving away your power to an external deity and meant to keep you from knowing who you really are. As long as some religious leader, both mainstream or not, can get you to give away your power to an external being or idea, you are not in a position to spiral out of the Game. Hence ALL religion is a dead end for simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves. New Age Shamanism - “Power Animals” On the American continents, the pursuit of ‘animal spirit guides and guardians’ is a drive of those who dabble and engage in shamanic practices. Americans, always looking for power over others in one form or another, prefer calling these animal spirits 'power animals'. Something to keep in mind - the seeking of power and control over others is the domain of the polarities BOTH Dark and Light. Genuine shamans do not have 'power animals', but will deal with animal spirits for specific guidance. If the shaman comes to look at the guide as superior and submits to the animal's will, balance is broken and power is given away. There is a nationwide training in the exploration of certain demi-shamanic techniques. This series of courses is open to those who can pay. An important note: TRUE shamanism can NEVER be bought. My main shamanic teacher had me attend one of this group's basic teaching weekends in the late 8o’s. I had a few years of genuine shamanic training at this time. I was taken back by how the participants were instructed into ignoring all safeguards and invading the animal spirit realm without regard for their safety or any concern other than finding a 'power animal’. I will not go into further detail on this as it is only for properly instructed shaman apprentices. Animal group soul incarnates who become animal subservient shamans are another story. During the weekend, the participants were told to ‘become their animal’. They formed a large circle and acted as their animal spirit. This is one way of inviting animal spirit possession of the human. The animal they opened themselves up to was the one they brought back from the animal spirit realm. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 223"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"This animal realm is comparable to a generally pleasant level found on a Monroe focus level. There are lots of woods, plains, waters and other areas. This is not in the location of Monroe upper levels, the levels of the Higher Self incarnations. This animal spirit realm resides parallel to the planetary spirit location where Earth's Spirit can be found. Something to consider...does this make the planetary spirit the Group Soul of the nature realm on the planet shim resides in and the 3rd density incarnations in everything from rock to air are shim's individual incarnations? It will make you look at certain things differently. The animal spirit realm should never be barged into like a bunch of American tourists with superiority complexes. A respect for the incarnational path of nature must be developed, and it is in Advanced incarnations. This doesn't mean living off air and water, but it certainly isn't killing the buffalo as they did in the 1800's. You will get input from the real you, your Higher Self, as you mature. Bursting into the animal spirit realm is done by Dark, immature and, many times, otherwise well-intending people. Remember the old adage: the road to hell is paved with good intentions. In this case, the 'good intentions' are centered around 'what can these spirits do for me'. It’s also part of giving AWAY your power. The Higher Self is about regaining all personal power, not giving it away to animal guides/guardians or humans or aliens. Once you realize this, you no longer need these externals. I know shamans who say all they do is done because of their animal associations. If the animals are doing it all, why are they there? The Higher Self shaman is to learn that they need no animals. The Higher Self has the ability to do all. THAT is what you will learn. Have respect and balanced compassion for the creatures of Earth, but realize they have their experiences and roles to play on the planet. To Men Who Want To Open Their Heart Chakra Last weekend I was asked how a male can obtain an open heart chakra for himself. This is easy in a female incarnation, but not so for a male until he's reached at least mid-Advanced levels. Therefore, I am writing this with them in mind. Your Higher Self is ultimately to decide when and in which incarnations will the powerful heart chakra be opened. When the heart chakra is opened, emotions flow freely. In a female body, the lesson to learn is to control these emotions so they do not rule you. In males, the control is usually there, but there is a fear (especially in males considering themselves heterosexual) of their female energies. \"I'm a guy. I don't have female energy\", they may say. In that case, he is NOT ready to try the steps below. Remember, outside of the incarnation, we are all BOTH male AND female balanced in one. There are certain pre-requisites that you guys must meet before your heart chakra will be opened (by your Higher Self). It usually helps if you are in a gay incarnation, but it can be done by any orientation IF the spirit is strong/Advanced enough to overrule the body. Also, sage smudging will greatly assist you in clearing your auric field as will massage help in stimulating the chakra areas. If you have a trusted friend or one with his heart chakra opened, they can assist you greatly if only just to listen and advise you.

Second - You must RECOGNIZE what these male AND female energies are, especially in regard to your current incarnation. Third - You must EMBRACE, in your case, your female energies and bring them into balance with your male energies. This is not the Balance I've talked about in M5, but rather a balance AND expression of male/female energies. Fourth - You must DEMONSTRATE to yourself that you understand, recognize and embrace your female side. This is primarily done by the rejection of the fears that keep you from doing the first 3 steps. You demonstrate this by living what you've learned. Fifth - Once you are comfortable and have demonstrated this energy balance, THEN can you SEEK the opening of the heart chakra. Remember, you can only try and fool yourself (incarnation) but you cannot fool your Higher Self who is watching your progress nor anyone else who has this chakra properly opened. When the heart chakra is connected, your emotional flood gates will open wide and all repressed/restrained emotion will come pouring out in tears at first, but this will subside once expressed sufficiently. You will find this, if you achieve it, to be one of the most liberating events you will face in that incarnation. Psychic abilities tend to increase and the connection to your Higher Self is far stronger. It is cleansing, fulfilling, rewarding and most amazing. The Effect of “Surrounding With White Light” \"Place the white light around you for protection” says the “love & lighter”. As I've said before, white light does NOT protect anyone. Since that's the case, why is this false phrase so commonly used? It is the chess game between Dark and Light played in third density and the incarnations are the playing pieces. Just as in chess, there are 2 colors. In this case, black and white. In order for you to play in their game, you must choose a side. Surrounding yourself with white light identifies you, on the astral, as a Light side player. Surrounding yourself with black light identifies you as a Dark side player. These auras are used so that the polarities know who their allies and enemies are and will act accordingly. Protective? Not at all. If anything, using a polarity light will encourage attacks by the opposing side since it radiates like a beacon in the astral. The polarities are constantly recruiting new members and members have been known to change sides. It's all a game. So, enter gold light. Gold light will nullify BOTH white and black light. It's interesting that when the Light polarity attacks, their offensive astral creations become black. This is because black is the color of polarity attack. So, when a Light attacks a Dark, Dark will absorb the attack and it increases Dark's power. It is a myth that Light creates light astral weaponry. Light is masochistic, turn the other cheek stuff. Dark is sadistic, aggressive and accepts the turned cheek as something not yet attacked. As a shaman, I've removed and dealt with both polarities and have seen only black-colored weaponry. No such thing as white-colored weaponry except in Light myths. Gold light will instantly dissolve black and is a bane to BOTH Dark and Light. The polarities wish Balance would go elsewhere. In the historical FICTION known as the bible, it says MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Balance is rejected by the polarities with cautions against non-participants in the Game. This is pure bullshit. Polarities fear Balance because they know that both Dark and Light will eventually be absorbed into Balance with is a blending of the polarities NOT in yin/yang but in gray. So, cover yourself in white or black light IF you still wish to play the living chess game. We've all done it at different stages of our incarnations. Eventually you mature in experiences to see the polarities for what they are and will no longer play the games (as much as possible to exist in current Earth). This should give all of you lots to think about. More on White Light \"Cover yourself in white light. It'll protect you.\" Variations of these phrases are used by many. It's time to reveal the fallacy of white light. Both polarities use light. Dark uses black light. Light uses white light. The lights are visible on the astral. They also serve as ID badges. Dark workers seek out those who surround themselves in white light. It is these who they will go after. WHITE LIGHT'WILL NOT PROTECT YOU FROM ANYTHING. Using white light will just identify you as a Light polarity worker, a masochist for the sadistic Dark polarity; a victim for the victimizer; a cheek-turner for those who love to slap cheeks! White light is the beacon that draws Dark to you! White light serves NO other purpose. Since this is the case, you have to look at all those who tell their followers to surround themselves in white light. Yes, there are those who are well meaning and believe it to be true. There are also those who are agents of Dark and want to identify those who innocently cover themselves in non-protective white light. Dark can be very insidious, very deceptive. That 'cover yourself in white light' gets so much publicity should also warn you since Earth is under Dark control. If you would like to carry something to protect yourself, carry a black tourmaline on your left side. This stone reflects many harmful (Dark AND Light) energies back to the sender and away from you. The left side of your body is where incoming energies enter. The right side is where energies from you exit. Energy Colors Do you notice how green and red colored energies (encased in black or white) are the primarily used colors in attacks? Green is the color of the solar plexus chakra, the seat of attack/defense. Red is the color of the sexual chakra, the seat of creating energy. When you are attacked, it is the solar plexus chakra that is the recipient of the attack as well as where energy is sent from to attack another. The feeling in the ‘pit of your stomach’ when someone does you wrong is the solar plexus chakra slamming shut in defense of an anticipated attack. This is the physical manifestation of an action bv vour spirit self. Dark and Light both uses lower energies when attacking. The glowing green figure of a Dark one on the cover of a book aptly shows the summoning of the solar plexus energies. This is commonly shown in fantasy based movies as well. However, when Dark attacks, they also use the red sexual energy to create the attack which can look as red-enhanced green beams or any variety thereof. Many/most times this energy is sheathed in black, the calling card M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 226"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. color of Dark. When it is sheathed in white, it is the calling card of Light. These are signature energies. Light likes to wrap itself in blue energy, the color of devotion. It doesn’t mean devotion to something specific, just devotion. It is just as easily used by Dark in their devotions. One is white-coated blue, the other is black coated blue, but blue nevertheless. White likes to claim blue as one of its colors. This is a propaganda lie, but Dark doesn’t like to tip its hand unless necessary. Blue glowing figures are generally used for Light-siders. This is also propaganda as Dark can glow blue as well in proper instances. Red, green and black are common Dark portrayals while blue and white are common Light portrayals. Just remember that both polarities use propaganda for creating an image they desire. Light lies just like Dark, but Light gets highly indignant when you call them on it, the nature of Light. As stated many times before, the gold energy will deflect or disperse these depending on how much energy you put into your defenses. The more you develop, the stronger potential you have in defending yourself. White does NOT deflect black nor does black deflect white. Rather they attract each other and feed each other. Black needs white and white needs black. If you surround yourself with black or white, you WILL attract the other polarity. If you surround yourself with gold, they tend to look elsewhere in the attack mode. A Bit More on Blue Again, blue is simple the color of devotion. The who or what the devotion represents is another question. It is a favorite of Dark because Light has the PUBLIC reputation of using blue, so 99% of those who see it think of ‘good’ and the Light side. This is a Dark deception. The color of the UN flag is blue, UN helmets are blue ... but their devotion? Well, I think you all know. Dark also won’t hesitate to use white if it suits them. Dark is very opportunistic. If you check below their use of white, it is pure black. Remember the wolf in sheep’s clothing fable. This is discernable by those who KNOW. Although they can use 3 rd dimension white, it cannot disguise their aura! It only fools 3 rd density eyes and minds. With the Israeli flag, the Star of ‘David’ is composed of 2 triangles, one point up and the other, point down. According to Morning Sky, the Orion reptilians use the up pointed triangle to indicate their genetic scientists and the down pointed triangle for their military. Put them together and you have the Star of ‘David’, the emblem of the united military and sciences of Orion. The ‘god’ of the bible is actually the reptilian Orion queen. The white on the Israeli flag is the sheep’s clothing. Take it from there. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Observations: More Data On Colors - The Latest Diversion David Icke's latest 'thing', on his web site, was turquoise. It seems he will be in a turquoise 'outfit' (see his comments on his site) since he believes, based on one 'scientist' that turquoise is the color of the universe. <sigh> The physical/3rd density matters that Earther humans get caught up in are all pretty much guaranteed to take one AWAY from knowing who they really are.

All Rights Reserved. From Icke's site: \"I cured my male cat of debilitating feline urological syndrome with turquoise, the colour of the 5th ehakra, and the centre of communication energies.\" That comment is from a Canadian 'meta-physicist'. Turquoise is NOT the color of the 5th (throat) chakra. What would have been correct for him to say was that he used turquoise color energies through his cat's 'throat chakra'. ANY color can be used on any chakra for specific events. Just because he used that color successfully, in this one case, does NOT mean what he claims. The true color of the 5th chakra is deep blue. This guy used a combination of blue & green (turquoise). It's the green that is the healing color while the blue is calming. Also, Icke is placing TOO much emphasis on clothing color. 'You attract what you wear' has some validity. If you're wearing a t-shirt with Jerry Garcia on it, you will likely attract other Deadheads. When I wear the Matrix 5 t-shirt with the book cover on it, I'm looking to attract others who might recognize it. Wearing colors, though, is strictly a personal decision and, in most cases, does NOT have cosmic implications! You wear what you tend to look good in. Pink is the color of love/affection in higher densities, but yet a lot of shrews wear pink on Earth and they exemplify control/domination of men. The color has NO effect on them. Many hard core Lightsiders wear all white. That's a joke. Remember, too, what I wrote about surrounding yourself in white light. Wear what you like and whenever you like. Resist getting caught up in color identities in regard to clothing. Black is a flattering color in clothing. It does not mean you favor the Dark side just as pink doesn’t mean you're a loving person! Green is the color of conformity, but can also be used for healing, depending on intent...and so on. More On The Nature Of GOLD Light (Special Gold Edition Segment) Earlier, I discussed the use of gold light in a protective shell around yourself as well as other defensive uses for this color. I suggest you reread those sections to renew your awareness of that topic. Gold light has other uses far more potent that protection and defense. Gold light is the color of creation/creating. Today I took a classical cd and thought 1 had taken one title, but wound up with a different one (my Higher Self in action). While playing this in my car, I was given a rote of information on gold light that I wasn't consciously aware of before. This came complete with visions and powerful emotional vibrations. Things like this have happened to me before when driving. I know that I won't run up a pole or similar as my Higher Self will control the vehicle during one of these download phases. As a side note, my most Dominant of my Dominant incarnation trio decided to appear to me, while I was zipping down an Interstate road, to convey information I needed about my China trip of last April. It IS most interesting in the Awakened Final Incarnation phases. The cd I am listening to in my car is Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake recorded in 1963 by Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra. I know that there is some potent knowledge purposely hidden in some of the classics. This knowledge was instilled by Higher Self Very Advanced and higher incarnations of the time for use by those needing it NOW. The keys are musical in nature and will react with you according to your level of Advancement and the time set by your Higher Self. This Swan Lake is ONE of these compositions.

Again, as with previous highly Advanced subjects, English is very poor in giving me ways to describe what I can see. I'm glad that once we are done with 3rd density, the limitations of verbal languages are left behind. The pure energy of Higher Self thought IS gold light in appearance when used to create. Light is used by these beings for so much, as is sound. ANYTHING can be cured on the 3rd density level through the use of light and of sound. Remember, everything you have seen and heard is forever imprinted in your Higher Self. I can think of the exact sounds of that section of Swan Lake and the sound is as rich as listening to it on a Bose sound system. These sounds and colors are needed in higher densities for matters that you will learn when your Higher Self has determined it is necessary for you. Once you have graduated 3rd density on the Earther fast track, you will have the awareness of this and will build on it in higher densities. Something absolutely amazing awaits. I have only been given a glimpse of it and it is more powerful that could be contained within a human physical. It is pure spirit, uncontaminated by polarities. Gold light is the energy of pure Balance. This is why gold light has a repelling effect on both Dark and Light energies. United it stands (gold), divided it falls (polarity). Gold light energy - search this out in the Library on 27 when you are able to do so. Even more information on gold light is contained within your Higher Self. Earther planetary controllers are using 'fear' on Earth to manipulate Earthers and attempt to close down your reception of information such as this. Your Higher Self WILL prevail, though. Keep moving forward and spiral out of the Game. Spiritual Healing This past weekend I attended a seminar where I heard a friend of mine, a Reiki master, give a workshop on Reiki healing. She made a point, more than once, of saying that the healing does not come from her, but from the 'universe'. We've all heard spiritual healers deny that they are anything more than a channel for the healing energy. It's always from another external source. It is time to end that once and for all. The 'universal' energy that the Reiki master was talking about is nothing less (nor else) than her own Higher Self. The healing energy does not come from the incarnation's physical, true, but it comes from the spirit connection animating the incarnation. Each one of the energy streams originating from the Higher Self (see Matrix V cover), is an extension of the Higher Self with all the abilities shim has. The progression of incarnations is rediscovering who you really are and reclaiming your powers. Healing is one of your natural abilities. You are taught by The Game that you are nothing and that an external deity is who you owe all to. THIS IS A LIE. While spiritual healers try the Light polarity blurbs of 'it's not me, it’s the universe/'god'/jesus’ or anything external, they deny who they are. This applies even through the Very Advanced stages who just haven't clicked with their own Higher Self. This may not settle fully with you until you are a Final Incarnation or one of your Dominants. The healing ability is from you and no other source! During this weekend, I also gave a lecture on my materials (first time) and I was asked who deity is. I described the formation of popularly conceived deities (pagan pantheons, MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition 229 1"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Ouest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Christian pantheons, etc) that are found on Monroe Level 25. These deities are created by the wills of those who worship an image they form in their minds. These 'deities’ exist ONLY because they are given life by developing Higher Selves. The next question was, then who is THE deity. The answer is YOU are your own deity. That is insinuated in my materials. It is a MAJOR step for you to consciously come to this realization. The Game would call this a prime 'sin' to dare think that you are better/more than 'god'. They do NOT want you to know who you are. Once you have advanced enough through experience, you come to the realization and your abilities will manifest. Confidence in and reclaiming of your power are essential. If you still defer to others and their flawed opinions/controls, you cannot reach the top of your mountain on 3rd density Earth. Fortunately, ALL Higher Selves will eventually reclaim their power and the polarities will be overcome. For now, just remember and consider that you must do away with the Light polarity's false humility. It is the healer who is healing. The healings become MUCH more potent when you realize and KNOW that this comes from you. You cannot reach your full potential as a healer until you do. One other situation to keep in mind as a healer: Each Higher Self has shim's own Path and will stick with it. This is why the true healer will know they cannot alter another Higher Selfs chosen destiny. You cannot heal someone if it runs contrary to that person's Higher Selfs Plan. You can ease their passing, but not thwart the other's road. This is why no shaman, healer, etc can stop what that person's Higher Self requires even if the incarnation is not advanced enough to know it. There is much to consider in this section and, as usual, much more to this. The seeds are here for your success. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Revelation: Percentage of Brain Use This is something the mediator was saying on his site (Andromedan Discussion Group): \"As a reminder, the Andromedans are thousands of years in advance to us and our science and understanding. As a reminder, in their reality the use 80+ % of their brain capability to our 15-%. And yet we are their equals. Now does that not ring a bell of truth.\" Comment: Notice how he worships \"science\" and believes it goes hand in hand with \"understanding\". They do not. The more you rely on 'science & technology', the less you rely on spirituality. This is giving away one's power to 'science & technology'. True higher beings don't need or use ships to travel in or technology to do things. His statements also go to encourage the state of awe over aliens, which serves their faction of The Game. Remember external deities of any sort! Also, we are NOT the equals of the aliens, except at mid level incarnation or lower Advanced stages. Once into the VERY Advanced stages, you have spiritually progressed beyond their levels! The 'we are all equal' horse shit is part of the alien manipulation to keep you focused on THEM (external deities). This percentage of brain use is another flawed statement. IF you don't use something over hundreds of thousands of years, it will atrophy and shrivel up. IF Earther humans were only using a minor percentage of our brain, it would not be the size it is. The human brain would be undergoing a series of shrinkages. It has not. I don't know which alien group started that line of shit, but it seems to have strongly taken root here. Even the. interesting focus level 24 film, Defending Your Life, harps on percentage of brain usage despite the fact that all the 230"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. people there are dead and have NO brain! The likelihood is that the aliens want to maintain a superiority position based on technology alone. Unfortunately, the alien genetic scientists, when they created separate genders here, made sure that the original DNA commands we had, that could CONSCIOUSLY use the brain to its fullest, were cut up and made unusable. This means that while the incarnating spirit CAN (and DOES, depending on level of progression) make use of the full brain function, the body cannot unless the spirit has matured enough to override the damaged DNA commands. This occurs in genuine psychics and similar sensitives. This is a bit difficult to explain, but you will understand it when you are ready. Take heart as there are LOADS of lies & half truths about Earther Higher Self incarnations that those on the other side of The Game do NOT want you to be consciously aware of because IF you do become aware of them, you will win The Game by finding the escape hatches set into The Game just for this purpose. Touch Therapies & Minor Melding Chiropractic and massage therapies are two prominent healing methods where it is necessary for the practitioner to touch/manipulate the recipient. Both can do wonders for the physical body which thrives with physical contact. I regularly visit both practitioners and mine are also male (like energy to like energy). The chiropractor adjusts the spine for optimum benefit. The massage therapist stimulates the muscles to move blood and release built up toxins. I do strongly recommend both therapies. Now to look at both therapies from another standpoint. Both practitioners must get into the auric fields of the recipient. You should talk with the potential practitioner before you have him/her work on you. Note your intuition on the person. Once you allow someone into your auric field, you open yourself up. There are Darksiders out there who can and will steal your energies/soul pieces. I have run into these types on the astral when doing shamanic work. Also, if you are male, my advice is to avoid female practitioners due to their inherent succubistic nature and the draining of male energies. They could be the nicest female you've ever met, but the energy draining ability is still there even if she is not consciously aware of it. My massage practitioner says that he's talked with some males who say they 'just couldn't have some guy massaging' them. In this case, that male will run to the female. Males, of these lower levels, are reacting from a body controlled position and need the experience of having their energies drained. You have to go through hell to realize this and break the accompanying experiential loop. These male bodies still don't have Advanced enough spirits to break this Game loop. While I do understand this level of person, they are far from being ready for the bulk of Matrix 5 materials at this time. Females will receive optimum benefits with massage and chiropractic, like males, if they have the services of a spirit driven(same gender) practitioner rather than spirit dragged (opposite gender) practitioner. If the females HAVE to have a male practitioner, it's the body, like a vampire, demanding to drain a male's energy (alien DNA command). If a male HAS to have a female practitioner, he's obeying his alien DNA command to allow himself to be drained by the succubistic female. Again, of course we all must pass through this segment of the Game to come to this realization. If you feel you have to have the opposite gender, you should not be reading the Matrix 5 materials. Remember who these materials M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. are written for and how you are just upsetting yourself by reading what you are not yet Advanced enough for at this time. I am also trained in massage therapy. I have given massages to former male friends (who are body ruled). My specialty involves clearing the chakras during the massage and the session lasts at least 1 hour. When I do that, I’m able to touch the receiver's spirit and give shim a boost. Unfortunately, when the spirit isn’t strong enough to take control from the body, the DNA commands' alarm systems go off and run into overdrive to suppress the spirit's control very soon after the session. This massage does not involve sex at all, but rather the body's DNA commands react to me connecting to the spirit and attempting to upgrade the spirit's progression. The person's Higher Self wanted my work done and was able to suppress the body long enough to receive it. Even if the body re-exerts control, I have already assisted the spirit in awakening. I've offered to teach this technique to 4 different men and all 4 refused my offer. THAT tells me where they are not yet for the right ones would jump at the chance to learn these techniques. Here's a MAJOR factor in body related work: IF the practitioner has an emotional tie to you, such as friend, the benefit to you is doubled. It becomes not only physical, but also spiritual. A woman can do wonders for her female friends as a man can do wonders for his male friends. The problem, especially with het males, IS being het and all the negative baggage that brings. However, when you progress far enough, you start dropping this baggage and opening yourself to higher opportunities. Where that leads you is something you all will eventually discover as your spiraling out of the Game, continue. Another type of touch therapy people engage in is sex. IF it is sex JUST for sex, it is of the body and not of the spirit. So many people have sex with no emotional ties to the other person that the sex is empty and unfulfilling. Yes, you satisfied a physical need but by ignoring the equally important spiritual need, you are wanting for more and seem to always be looking for that elusive 'perfect' partner. This is an old alien DNA command - one of the oldest - sex for sex. While sex for sex is usually interesting for someone just discovering it, sex for sex alone can rapidly leave the spirit craving what shim’s NOT getting and that's spiritual energy compatibility. When you combine the physical with the spiritual AND both are moving in the similar Path directions, you have a relationship that will grow and enhance each other. This is a rare gem in the world today, but one that can be realized. The two people would be of the same gender and a similar level of spiritual maturity. It cannot work if they are opposite genders due to the Game's warped influence and the female draining the male's energies. Parasitic relationships cannot work. I have written quite a bit on this topic already. When two people of the same gender and similar spiritual levels form a partnership, you have a minor melding of spirits that is like a temporary melding of two Higher Self spirits. Since both physical bodies are the same polarity, both spirits are moving to higher vibrations, input from two Higher Selves can manifest easier on 3rd density Earth. THIS is something the Game absolutely cringes against. These two people will Advance rapidly while paired. These insights will give you some ideas about touch therapies and types of escapes from the Game. You should NOT get into a relationship JUST to be in a relationship. I would never get involved in the Huzband-Of-The-Month club (yes, huzband is a gay spelling of the het term). That is still a body orientation. Hets can belong to the Marriage-Of-The-Year club and recycle spouses just as easily. I've never been in a relationship because. I wouldn't even MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 232"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"consider it with a guy who is not moving on a similar path, and, at my stage, that’s a hard one to find.

[Ed.- See also the segment The Vibration of Affection] MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Minor Melding II - Part II In my previous segment, I briefly touched on the subject of minor melding. Melding is a term used to indicate a blending of 2 spirit entities' energies. Prime Melding happens when your Final Incarnation recalls all of shim's incarnations to the Higher Self and then moves to the next level of progression. Minor meldings are temporary in nature. They can occur when two unobstructed spirits join to work together when progressing on similar paths. Unobstructed minor meldings can only occur between same gender physical bodies. The Game has warped this by introducing opposite gender marriages. The sequential, alien DNA scientists knew the effect of electrical polarity opposites coming together and that it shorts out true spiritual progression. I have explained this in earlier segments. Minor meldings were the standard back when Ancient Earthers populated the planet. The Game put an end to that and created a situation where those desiring the simultaneous incarnational path could rapidly progress despite all the Game would throw at them including hostile genders and polarities. Minor meldings DO include physical intensities. Sex, tenderness, touch and physical affection are expressions for the exchange of energies in 3rd density. If someone (same gender) says they are your friend or 'best' friend and then they say something like: 'I hate when you touch me’ or 'you're always so touchy-feely', they aren't really your friend on the level that you need one for minor melding and it's time to move on. This demonstrates incompatibility of paths. You are wasting your time with this one. If your intention is to 'save' or 'change' the person, then you are on a polarity binge. Genuine minor meldings are not all that common today, unfortunately. This is partially due to the individuality of Higher Self paths and the scattering of all incarnational levels over a wide period of Earthly 'time'. This adds to the challenge. To be successful in minor melding, here's some things to consider: *Opposites never attract. An example: I met this guy where there was instant physical attraction. After talking with him, I found we had nothing in common and I told him it was no use continuing the discussion. He said, 'but opposites attract'. That is a Game lie and at my Final stage, I cannot be swayed by those terms AND I wasn't looking for a fling. For my level, flings are SO unfulfilling. *Paths must be similar. You can’t successfully mix a dead common, mid level incarnate with a Very Advanced incarnate, a Dominant Incarnation with a low incarnation or any other such glaringly different paths. Someone who is a religious adherent will do poorly with someone who has moved beyond religion. If you are into the psychic areas, you will not do yourself any favor by moving in with a Christian fundamentalist. Each one, in that case, would spend time trying to convert the other and stir controversy. This is pure body ID even if both are the same gender. Horoscopes are excellent indications of path for that incarnation and compatibilities do show there. 233"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"^'Spiritual compatibility is the second, but also equally important consideration. The same gender indicates physical compatibility. You must have the spiritual compatibility to go with it for minor melding success. Spiritual compatibility involves working together. The idea of changing the other person (standard thought form with women who constantly try to change the man they sink their fangs into) is doomed to failure and is very polaric and indicates control/dominance issues. This shows they are not on a similar path. SOME minor melding blend combinations that may (stress on 'may') work are two Final Incarnations, a Final Incarnation and a Very Advanced, two mid-Advanced levels, two mid level incarnations, and two low level incarnations. If you are in the Very Advanced and higher levels, you have to be careful not to saddle yourself with a spiritual dependent. Remember, growth should be assisting each other, not one following the other. You could go through many periods without a minor melding partner. It is a hallmark of your Progression if you don’t partner yourself with someone just to say you are in a relationship. The key is compatible/balanced relationship. I have yet to have a relationship in this current incarnation and would only consider such with another man who is moving along a similar path. If it doesn’t happen for me, then it's not meant to. Minor meldings do occur far easier on the astral plane due to no physical body/genders, but levels of Advancement still hold true. Also, polarities do exist on the astral and next few density levels, thus you will have to deal with that. There are still beings who will try to 'save' or to control you in the next few higher densities. Robert Monroe ran into some of them and some of his stories about these encounters appear in his trilogy. All your problems do not end with the conclusion of 3rd density incarnations. There will be other situations to deal with. Meldings, both Prime and minor, will continue beyond 3rd density Earth. Observations: Feng Shui & Yin/Yang I'm reading Essential Feng Shui by Lillian Too. On pg 48, she mentions 'The Attributes of yin and yang': Yin is DARK, stillness, LIFELESSNESS, and DEATH. Yin is the moon, the night time hours, the negative. Yin is the cold, it is the valley, and STAGNANT WATER. Yin is the FEMALE, passive, weak, soft and yielding. Yang is LIGHT, brightness, sunlight and the sun. Yang is activity, sounds, fire, strength, determination. Yang is movement, LIFE, raised landforms, mountains, the dragon. Yang is the MALE, dominant, hard, warm, heat. She correctly says 'summer, which is YANG, gives way to winter, which is YIN' and 'YANG energy is vibrant and alive with life. What Lillian Too says is almost the same as what I've said in Matrix 5, Life is male and death is female (love the stagnant water addition). So why do people insist on calling 'Mother' Nature and winter 'Old Man'??? Life, living and bounty are MALE. If anything, it should be 'Old Woman 1 winter and I've already made comments on insulting the Earth planetary spirit by calling shim 'female'. While it's nice to see that feng shui orientals do understand yin and yang, they can't comprehend the two joining into Balance, but that's part of the Game. They talk about the 'eternal' yin/yang and other Game MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

This is one way the Game tries to defeat the Higher Self incarnates by drilling into them 'you can't win'. Of course that's based on deceptions and outright lies. Feng shui is excellent material and I've adapted it in my home. One thing to know though, it is NOT a cure all. I know 2 totally incompatible people who hired a feng shui person to go through the house. All the feng shui in the universe won't make these 2 compatible. For that you deal with astrology. Feng shui will be able to assist with home/work energy flows, but cannot overcome astrological clashes. Feng shui practitioners can optimize environment but they still can't make gold out of shit! They say how feng shui is used all over Asia and that's true, BUT how many rich, singing from sunrise to sunset people are there in Asia and how many are just scratching to get by. Know feng shui as an enhancer that it can be BUT it will not make someone slated for a low income life suddenly become rich. Remember, it's the Higher Selfs Plan that is in motion and that cannot be circumvented. M A TRJX V: The Gold Edition The Myth of Angels The statement that the material I've written is for Dominant and Final Incarnations does not deter some people from responding with comments that are pure horseshit. One such comment was that we feed energy to angels and divas who, in turn, grant your wishes. Can you believe someone actually said that with a straight face?! I also saw in the local free paper, in the classifieds, that some believer in the mary myth had this prayer to her followed by instructions that if you pray this 3 times, say Heil (my word) marys AND publish this crap, your WISH will be granted. They're always looking for a genie. Angels are mythological creatures created by those who perpetuate the mythological pantheon of jesus, mary, 12 apostles and so on. The Christian mythology is no more valid, and probably less valid, than Celtic, Norse, Greek and other mythologies. However these older mythologies are primarily based on aliens, especially the Egyptian pantheon where Isis is based on the reptilian genetic scientist who was primarily responsible for splitting Earth humans into 2 genders. Because Monroe level 25 is loaded with all kinds of belief systems and humans have chosen to believe in the false religion of Christianity, you can find 'angels' on level 25. These have been created by human thought. They cannot exist without human thought feeding them. If people stopped believing that they exist, they will fade away and their binding energy will return to an unformed state. As long as people continue to feed them and give their power away to them, they will be there on 25 waiting to order you about. Sedona, Arizona is crawling with angel pushers. Someone to take care of you. Someone to SAVE you. Someone to keep you from finding out who you really are is much more like it. The infection of angel control has dramatically increased since the mid-8o's. I saw a Christmas tree in Burlington, Vermont that was covered in wing-flapping angels. A friend with me seeing that said, \"Get a fly swatter\". Final Incarnations will see angels for what they really are - myth. As for devas, they're part of the nature spirit stream of progression and are quite advanced. Devas pay little, if any, attention to those in the Higher Self progression. Those in awareness (VERY Advanced and Final Incarnations) do likewise to them. We do interact, to a certain degree with low level nature spirits, especially earth spirits who are very curious. But other than respecting and admiring what they do (with plant growths), we let them do their own things. 235"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"I have been asked about the nature spirit line of progression and it just isn't our concern at the 3rd density level. Eventually, higher up, you will learn much more about them, but that is for a later stage in your progression. Revelation: 'Ascended Masters' We have all heard of the so-called 'Ascended Masters' and many of us know the names of these alleged beings. The Game, through the polarities and sequential incarnates, warps what is to create dead ends and false paths to prevent or, at least, retard spiraling out of the Game. 'Ascended Masters' is one of them. When an Earther Higher Self completes the incarnational cycle, reintegrates all shim’s 3rd density incarnations and move up (ascends) to the next level, THAT Higher Self becomes an Ascended Entity. That is the basis for the lie known as 'Ascended Masters'. As with all 'masters', slaves/followers are required. This means giving away of one's power to an external. This is pure Game. Part of your spiral out is to recognize these various lures, to give away your power/control of self, for what they are. There is one site I've looked at that has drawings of these polarity/alien creations called 'Ascended Masters'. One thing I’ve noticed on all of them was the sinister look in their eyes. You have no need of ANY kind of 'master'. Once a Higher Self has won the Game, shim no longer needs to be involved in it. There are many new experiences to have. If a being is involved in the Game, it's because that being's Higher Self is still engaged in the learning process in 3rd density. The deception comes when an incarnation tries to control others with the 'one way' that they all seem to offer. If anyone offers a 'one way' as the only way, it's time to move on since each Higher Self progresses differently and uniquely. If you've read 'Ascended Master' material, it's loaded primarily with Light-sider unconditional love bullshit and the desire to shepherd you to their tune. If there were no sheep, there would be no shepherds. They are searching for sheep! Being aware of this should assist you in avoiding the 'Ascended Master’ detours. Of course if your Higher Self requires such a detour, then off you go and experience. After your experience you will also know who they are and are not. Revelation: 'Ascended Masters' - Part II As with all other religions, the New Age religion, intended to be the planetary religion upon One World completion, needs a pantheon of deities. The so-called 'ascended masters' are the foundation of this pantheon. They already have kuthumi, buddah, jesus, mary and more. Diana will be another they intend to add. What they choose will appeal to various areas of the world. If you have researched the 'ascended masters' pantheon, you can see the development of the religion. You will find they need and will present both god and goddess figures to keep the true nature of the spirit in denial. Pantheons tend to have 12 major deities and a host of minor ones, such as catholic gods/goddesses known as saints. The New Age religion will likely have this as well. This New Age pantheon will gain increasingly more exposure, especially with the assaults on the catholic, protestant, muslim and hindu religions in today's press.

Even though people think it's justified, it is being orchestrated with the New Age religion to fill an eventual vacuum. Remember that these established religions were originally created as control devices based on fantasy and legends. Their time is almost over, having served their purposes. Now it’s time for a new control device in religion. When you examine what is happening in the news, you must dig deeper than the surface story. Priests have sex with teenagers. Muslims are terrorists. These buzzword headlines are meant to push the buttons of the unaware. There is nothing new in these headlines, but that they are being given so much publicity now means they are needed to play a role in the continuing subversion of Earth. I advise you not to dance to their tune, but to examine and dig deeper if you are interested in why. Since the core of these headlines is religion, that’s where you need to look. Here comes slithering in a new religion headed by a variety of New Age icons called 'ascended masters'. Can you see where this is intended to go? Revelation: Akashic Records (Special Gold Edition Segment) The legend is that the \"Akashic Records\" are the total event histories of the 3rd density and much more. The term \"Akashic Records\" comes from Asia and, as usual with religion, has a mystical glow about it meant to keep the believer a bit off balance. What really are the \"Akashic Records\"? In reality, this term refers to the collective knowledge that is contained within EACH Higher Self. When someone says they want to access the Akashic Records, they would actually go within themselves to attempt to tap into their Higher Selfs vast knowledge banks. With religion, as usual, they talk about looking for the Akashic Records as one would look for the Library on Monroe Level 27. Some have believed the Library to be the Akashic Records. It is not. The Library is an extension of the Higher Self knowledge banks. It contains only a fraction of the Higher Selves information. The simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves have created the Library to make a portion of their accumulated knowledge available to those able to access level 27. The massive Higher Self knowledge is restricted while you are in the Game. After you have had your Awakened Final Incarnation and finished your participation in the Game, then this knowledge, in full, is available to you once again. Just as religions, etc demand you look for the non-existent, external deity, so do those who have coined the words, \"Akashic Records\", want you to look for an external source of knowledge and wisdom. This is part of the polaric deception that continues in certain sections of higher-than-third densities. To counter this dead end in the Game, this segment exposes just what the \"Akashic Records\" are and are not. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition 237 |"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Revelation: 'Guides'/ 'Guardian Angels' (Special Gold Edition Segment) In an earlier segment, I explained that 'guides' and 'guardian angels' are not some wandering being assigned to spend the rest of your incarnation watching what you are doing. This is a Christian fantasy (guardian 'angel') and a new age fantasy (guide). I have done lots of shamanic journeys for people and have met with each person's guide. When I do a journey, 1 always request the person's guide come forward. When this being comes to me, an identity is given to me to give to that person. After a journey is completed, one of the many things I tell a person is who the guide is and a brief description of shim. The guide is actually in the appearance of another of that Higher Selfs incarnation. It is NOT the incarnation as such, just the image of one. I've found that those in North America have a 'guide' who is Native American in appearance. Those in other countries have 'guides' in the appearance of the land they live in, such as Celtic for those in British areas. This is to make it more comfortable for the incarnation to accept the information the guide has to reveal. The guide travels with me to assist in a journey for that current incarnation who requested this assistance. The guide shows me where, for example, missing soul pieces are for that person, after which I act on the information. Now here's the core of the ’guide'/\"guardian angel' experience: When that Higher Self has something to convey to the incarnation, something that requires extra effort, that Higher Self utilizes the incarnational stream that comes from the Higher Self proper. Just above where the Higher Self incarnates into a person, the energy forms a small stream apart from the larger one (an inverted Y shape) and the smaller stream assumes the shape of one of shim's other incarnations to communicate to the incarnated message receiver. Once the message is received, usually by dream or meditation (although, if necessary, by even more dramatic ways), the guide stream is withdrawn back into the main incarnational connection of the Higher Self. This is why the 'guide' is not there on demand. The Higher Self does not engage in 'thrills' of this sort as they serve no purpose other than curiosity and this curiosity is of less than Very Advanced levels. The 'guide' apparition is a common way that the Higher Self communes with shim's incarnations until the Awakened Final Incarnation. It is the belief, in almost all people, that some fictitious deity assigns some being to be their 'guide'. This is religion warping the manifestation of the Higher Self to shim’s incarnation. Religion exists, primarily, to keep you from discovering your Higher Self and all connected to that knowledge. The 'guide' becomes another external to give one's power away to. In actuality, it IS you, but unless you realize it, you are going through the motions of power giveaway.Knowing, if you see your true 'guide', that this is an extension of your Higher Self can open some interesting possibilities for you to ask something directly of your Higher Self. Something else to keep in mind too - false 'guides'. These are lower astral beings who delight in coming to someone as their 'guide' to attempt to turn you off your path or just mess with you. I spoke to one woman once who told me that Buddha came to her in a dream and was crying because she was examining other options and belief systems. This being was attempting to get her to remain stagnant in her beliefs. Your Higher Self exists for change and new experiences. False guides can be very clever. They are polaric. They DO deceive many. Those Higher Selves allow their incarnations to be so deceived for the experience. They WILL learn from them. These are some of the rocks I mention in the Rocky Road segment in M5. Learning false from true guides is something you must do individually.

This is where you don't trust your astral 'eyes'. You MUST look deeper. This comes with experience. You will make mistakes, but this is part of the learning process. One common fallacy with 'guides' is the winged being. Since in densities above 3rd, will alone can move you to wherever you wish to go, there is no purpose in forming astral wings (although you could if you want just by willing them to be there). This .is another COMMON deception by lower astrals because they know most Earthers beLIEve that these are beings sent by 'god'. This is Lightsider propaganda. Religions encourage this. That, in itself, should tell you something. The lower astrals use it to their advantage. One time I was on the astral and saw what appeared to be someone's 'guide'. I looked at that being suspiciously and shim said to me, \"Do you feel more comfortable with this\" and a pair of wings appeared on the being. This is NOT from person's Higher Self. This is some lower astral meddling around. They are nothing to fear, but rather to chase away. They are part of your learning experience. Keep in mind that experiences are not limited to 3rd density for your incarnation. Several new and key items appear in this segment. Consider them well. Examining the ’Ascension’ and 'Rapture' (Special Gold Edition Segment) There are popular phrases with both new age groups and certain Christian cultists that amount to the same thing. The 'Ascension' is the new age term. 'Ascension' is the lifting off of Earth of the select so they no longer have to endure the trials of Earth. The 'Rapture' is a Christian cultist term, which is similar in regard to Christian cultists. 'Translation' or 'twinkling' is a mormon term. Translation is mormon for having one's body instantly changed from physical to immortal \"in the tiuinkling of an eye\". Note that in all 3 terms it is the body where the concern is centered and the body's fear of death combined with the craving of immortality for it. This is a sequential alien fantasy that has gotten hold of many Earthers via religion. Religion on Earth will always find some alien or alien idea at the root. The Orion queen's desire for an immortal body is the ultimate seed for the desire of the Earther body to want to 'live forever'. Since the reptilian genetic scientists were responsible for the creation of Earther bodies, as we know them today, that idea of physical immortality was instilled by the Empire. This, again, is also part of the Game. This is a dead end deception meant to keep you away from discovering who you really are. The ONLY way there would be any kind of mass teleportation of groups of people from Earth would be if alien ships were responsible. Remember that the sequentials are your opponents in the Game and no good can come out of such a trick by them. They will play to the religious mindsets and minions, who are great followers, will easily be caught up in that IF it were to occur. 'No thanks' would be my response, although only your Higher Self can decide what experiences shim wants for shimself. This myth of 'Ascension' is based on a truth that has become terribly warped. The true version of 'Ascension' occurs when your Final Incarnation summons all your Higher Selfs incarnational streams back within. THAT is the basis for the myths of group physical \"salvation\". The sequential incarnates will warp anything they can to try an delay the simultaneous from spiraling out of the Game. The thing is that there is a preset end to the Game that the sequentials are also unaware of. It is necessary for both the simultaneous and the sequential factions to be thus unaware in order for the Game to progress as planned.

New agers love to say \"planetary ascension\" for Earthers. This will not happen on Earth as that, again, is another sequential alien experience where they progress as a planet and everyone is close to being at the same place in progression. 'Planetary ascension' is very popular with new agers at this time and is being heavily pushed by several new age groups. When you hear of 'planetary ascension', know that aliens are involved in that propaganda and that it is being used to sidetrack Earther simultaneous incarnates. Personal red flags should fly when you hear that term. When you hear the commonly used terms of 'Ascension', 'Rapture', 'Translation/Twinkling' or any other similar concept term, know that they are all red herrings/deceptions for the actions of your Final Incarnation when it is time for the real you to spiral out of the Game. Lightsider Deceptions Update I knew it would only be a matter of time before the mechanism of the Light side would see the effect of the Matrix 5 materials and try to warp parts of it to fit their agenda. I have just seen this in a message on a Lightsider site. The whole thing is gushing, as usual, with the sweet toxins of the Lightside. But, what is new is that they have taken the Higher Self and thrown shim into their mythology of deceptions. Here's a portion of it: \"It is time to teach unconditional Love and Power. Love and Power of God, of your Family of Light: Angels, Spirit Guides (by whatever name or perception you have), and unconditional Love and Power of your Higher Selves. It is time to understand that the Higher Self has God Realization and complete energetic and conscious connection with its incarnations on the Earth and beyond, and is in complete control of who you interact w r ith, both consciously and energetically, on every plane of existence. You are Safe! Even if you cannot go beyond the misconception that there are \"negative beings\" out there yet, know that you are safe through your Higher Self, your Guides of Light and God! St. Germain” Now look how the Lightside takes truth and mixes it with deception to lure the budding Advanced into their latest dead end. First it's the old 'unconditional love' crap that Lightsiders thrive in spewing. I have already dealt with that ideological nonsense. Now they try and tack it on to the Higher Self, Note too that, according to 'St Germain' (reptilian origin, by the way) the Higher Self is subordinate to the mythical 'god' (Orion queen), that seemingly omni-present being who they want you to give your power away to! They talk about the Higher Self, with some semi- true comments, but leave you the impression that you have NO independent controls and are just going through the motions in 3rd density. I had recently written v\\ r hy the incarnate spirit does NOT have the Higher Selfs full memory. This is another body-centric Lightsider fantasy, along with their popular 'spirits are genders' major myth. It also leads you to believe you are not responsible for anything you do. Love & Light...horseshit! The end sentence that I included above says \"you are safe through your Higher Self, your Guides of Light and God!\" Geez, that just makes me want to puke! They refuse to allow you to know that you are complete within your Higher Self, but that you also need external 'guides' and that fucking 'god', who is the simultaneous alien beings who messed with Ancient Earthers ages ago. 240"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. When you read the abundant garbage that the Lightsiders generate, I advise you to ALWAYS remember The Game and its 2 major players: Simultaneous and Sequential Higher Self incarnates. If you keep that in mind, you should be able to view the deceptions put out by the sequential incarnates as part of the Game's mechanisms to keep simultaneous incarnates from graduating the 3rd density experience. Now that I've seen the misuse of Matrix 5 materials in print by Lightsiders, I know M5 is having the effect they didn't count on: the loophole in the Game that allowed M5 to come out and the stimulation of the readers to their Higher Selves to break away from the Game and move to the next stage. I also expect to see more of the use of'Higher Self in Lightsider materials to deceive. They are using their \"Light\" to blind you from seeing where you are going IF you choose to follow them. You DO fall for that shit as you progress, but it is limited to Low Advanced through Mid Advanced levels. Trust your Higher Self and you will be fine. Astrology: Potent & Polaric Manipulations (Special Gold Edition Segment) I was sent a copy of Bush jr's horoscope with an interpretation that was flattering and glowing of him. One look at the chart told me \"what a bunch of crap\". The person who wrote the interpretation was probably hoping she would become the personal astrologer to the current occupant of the White House. I made some comments about what the horoscope really says about that Darksider. What I said about him is not the thrust of this segment. What you need to know is that astrology can be used by both Light and Dark polarities to gain the results desired. I've seen this happen over and over. An astrologer makes some grand declarations that I know just are false. This can go along with the Lightsider astrologer who believes that only the \"good\" things should be told and if you can't find many \"good\" things, create some. I have seen them create \"good\" things out of some flimsy scrapes of data that just are not true, but they sound great. Dark manipulations can include trying to steer the client into taking certain actions that are not to the client's benefit. If you have to ask 'why', you are not Advanced enough to handle this material. You would need to reexamine the definitions of Dark and Light polarities. Dark astrologers can go on bigger power trips. They may concentrate on things that bring distress to the client. Examples of the manipulation: The Bush sycophantic astrologer notes his Libra placements and says how \"diplomatic\" Libra is. Yes, it can be a very diplomatic sign. What you aren't told is that Libra can be the most vicious sign of all 12 if they fail at diplomacy. Not only that, but Bush is a Cancer. That sign is in hard aspect to the Libra placements and this brings conflict. Pluto is also in significant placement in this dictator-wanna-be's horoscope. Pluto is a sign of dictatorship/control. I heard twice on the news when this man said he wanted to be dictator. The first question is: Is astrology valid? Yes, it is. Astrology is the most complicated/complex of the psychic sciences and, therefore, the most potent. It takes a long time and lots of study to become a competent astrologer. Because it is so powerful and potent AND is used by planetary big shots, it is to their advantage to ensure that many false and pseudo astrologers are in the public eye. Your horoscope should not be published or M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 241"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"shown to everyone since it reveals your hidden sides and secrets. Be careful with your birth data and who you give that information to. The Game does NOT like the use of astrology by competent, ethical astrologers, especially of a Very Advanced level or higher. But, too bad, since the psychic sciences are allowed in the Game's rules. Since this is so, the Game resorts to belittling the psychic and related sciences to keep people away from what they may discover about themselves. The next question is: are astrologers ethical? Most of them are. Most will give you their best advice, however some of them are anything but ethical and this includes Light and Dark polarities. This bring up this question: how will I know if the astrologer I deal with is competent and ethical? The competency part is easy - ask for credentials. How long have you studied? Someone who has a computer program and sells computer generated horoscopes for $20 may not know any more about astrology than you. Check first. As far as ethics go, you will have to use your intuition. Some people can say anything. Be cautious of overpriced astrologers. I spoke to a person who said she got her horoscope for $1000, and, she said, it came in a leather folder. That impressed her more than her horoscope, apparently. If you spend more money, it does not mean you are getting a better horoscope. While I want you to understand that astrology can tell you almost anything about your current incarnation (and some of other incarnations you are having), it should be used as a tool, valuable but still a tool. Don't let astrology run your daily life. Make it the spice in your soup. Those daily horoscopes in newspapers are just for fun. I could write them. Take them ONLY as fun. Astrology is so unique that each chart is like a fingerprint, so having encapsulated 12 signs to stand for everyone (or anyone) in each sign, is impossible. I am not a commercial astrologer and I don’t know any personally, so don’t ask for recommendations from me. Reptilian Infighting: Moses vs. Egypt Blood, blood everywhere: The Prince of Egypt, available on tape, is an animated version of the biblical fable of Moses. Most people know the general stoiy, but you need to look deeper. Of course access to the Library on Monroe level 27 makes access to knowledge dealing with this (and countless other) subjects a breeze. Unfortunately, VERY few incarnated on Earth can touch the knowledge there. Although the Moses story never took place (Egypt was NOT destroyed when Ramesses I ruled, but rather increased), the story was meant to show the conflict between factions in the Orion Empire. ALL ancient deities, including those of the bible, are alien and the aliens were very overtly involved in ancient times. They were not unified and in harmony, but were highly competitive and jealous. (\"I am a jealous god\" - biblical deity). Once the Orion queen lost (temporary) control over this solar system to the rebel queen, the rebel queen and her allies sought to control different groups on Earth. However, in each group, the serpent played a visible part as did the flow of blood to satisfy the reptilian appetite and feed their 4th density relatives. Yes, I know that A LOT can be said about all these matters, but that's not the purpose here.

He threw down his staff and it became a serpent, calling card of the reptilians of Orion. Why not a lion, a hawk or an elephant? Because the serpent is the symbol of Orion power, both rebel and standard factions. Pharaoh, recognizing this as an opposing faction since it threatened him, had his priests throw down 2 staves, which also became serpents. Moses’ serpent ate the other two demonstrating the superior power of his reptilian faction at the time. It’s just like warring 'system lords' on Stargate SG-i! One thing to remember, the Israeli deity is male, therefore Sirian home world controlled, allied with the Orion queen. Pharaoh was aligned with Isis, the rebel queen and genetic scientist, and the rebel Sirian king and genetic scientist. That Moses' serpent ate the Pharaoh’s serpents demonstrated that the Orion queen would devour the rebel queen in time. The Sirians are the dog soldiers of Orion, so Moses was on a 'mission' for the Sirian king in the Orion queen’s name. Well, according to the story, the god of this small, primitive group of nomads beat the hell out of Egypt - water to BLOOD, fire from the skies, DEATH of the firstborn and destruction of Egypt's army all because the reptilian deity decided to war with the reptilian deities of Egypt. If this really happened, Egypt's neighboring enemies would have invaded and conquered Egypt with no real opposition. Obviously, this did not happen because the story never happened. Remember, the bible is written by followers of this deity and therefore written in such a way to increase belief in the deity's power. The bible is NOT history. It is historical fiction. It seeks to replace one (or several) sets of deities for this particular faction. You can only break free of ALL deities by realizing there is only one 'god' for YOU and you can see this god by looking into a mirror. Do not give away your power to an external being, unless you wish to be a servant. ALL reptilian factions demand blood sacrifice. In the Moses fable, you had water to BLOOD, BLOOD on the door posts, BLOOD sacrifices and death of first-born people AND animals (what did the animals do to piss off this 'god'?). The reptilian deity of this desert group (Remember, he told Moses 'I am the god of Abraham and Isaac'. He did NOT say 'I am the god of all on Earth’), became ambitious indeed. After directing these nomads to the land of 'milk and honey', they proceeded to kill and swindle all those already living there out of their land. This from the god who said, \"Thou shalt not kill’. Right. MUCH more can be said, unfortunately, the blood still flows today in the name of this deity. Two America’s 1 - America, the fictional land of the free where everyone has free speech, freedom to worship as they choose, freedom of association, freedom of the press, a government elected by the people who responds to the desires of ALL citizens. 2 - Amerika, the real U.S.A. This country does, unfortunately exist. Free speech - few segments of the population allow free speech. Take the Miami Christian gangster community. See all the freedom posters and talk, but when 2 women showed up with “Elian should go home” posters, they were attacked and beaten by this group who claims to be non-violent and freedom-loving.

Freedom of worship, in the USA means freedom to be Christian or jewish (grudgingly, though, jewish). Congress starts sessions with a religious poobah, but they are always Christian, possibly a token rabbi thrown in. How many muslim clerics, wiccan priestesses, hindu cleric, satanic ministers, scientologist ministers, etc have their day as an opener of Congress? Who would complain? The Christians, guaranteed. They spout freedom of religion, and that is supposed to mean ALL religions, but limit or ban those their narrow­ minded, hate filled religion don't agree with. They NEVER mean freedom of religion EXCEPT for Christianity. Freedom of association...try to associate with non-christian religions and the evil head of Christianity raises it's head. The chief cult of Amerika, ruled by the jealous god, shows its jealousy by viciously suppressing minority religions. What do they fear? That the false nature of their religion be discovered. Gay student groups, nope, the Christians don't like that either, even if it isn’t religious. So much for that association. Political freedoms, how about being a communist during the 50's? Freedom of the press...the mainstream press does not report the news, but rather try and convince you to take their views, which almost always are that of the government. Check the wording of headlines, the photographs used and the tone of the wording. Does mainstream press call non-mainstream religions 'cults'? Yes, even though they don't call mainstream religions, the cults of mary, jesus, mohammed, 'cults' (although they'd like to with muslim). How many people had themselves nailed to crosses this past week? They aren't called cults, but if any minority religion did that, the scream of dangerous cults goes up in the press. True, there are a very few, minority presses, but these get branded tabloids or fringe (therefore not worthy of consideration) rags. Freedom of the press should mean non-biased reporting...but not in Amerika. A government of, by and for the people...which president was elected by the majority of the voters? I don't know if there ever was one. Not a majority of those who voted, but a majority of the voters. The Presidents of Amerika are elected by a minority of the voters. If they win by 56% of 49% of the voters, that's not a landslide, that's a pitiful minority. Once elected, the person sets him/herself up as some kind of royalty that the people must bow to, rather than the other way around. Amerikans have given away their power by lowering themselves to elected officials and forgetting that THEY work for you. In how many businesses do bosses, bow down and tip-toe around their employees? Exactly. Now, even the minority elected government responds to those who fork over the most cash, not the desires of the constituents unless both are the same on one issue. It's not a government for the people; it's a government for the lobbies and powerful special interest groups. Amerika is a very sad place. Unfortunately, many in Amerika are in a fantasy land of America in their minds. It is in the interest of Amerika that people believe they are in America. Give away more power. In order to see Amerika for what it is, one must regain their power from politicians, from religion and from ALL others. Only then can one see Amerika for what it is and what it is not. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 244"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Breeding and American Over-Consumption Sunday's newspaper supplement has a headline shouting, \"What on Earth are we doing?\" with a side bar saying, \"The planet may not last another century if we don't curb consumption and population growth, experts say.\" The 'experts' are FAR too liberal in their estimations. The world as we know it will not last beyond 2012. The text describes that while Americans are about 5% of the world's population, they consume 1/3 of the planet’s energy and create half of the solid waste. American propaganda would have the whole world believe they can live like Americans do. This is impossible. In Jan 1900, the planet had 1.6 billion people. Despite World and local wars, as of Jan 1, 2001, Earth has over 6 billion people. 5-7 Earths would be needed to give the world the consumer rate of America. The article said population growth is not the only problem. If no more babies were born at all, the collapse would be delayed by only 7 years, and there's no need to consider that breeders will stop breeding. Consumerism American style is the U.S.'s prime export cloaked in the illusion of freedom. The world wants to consume more and more. The more they consume, the sooner the planet collapses. Reality is that the breeders will continue to breed, per the Orion DNA commands. The majority of the population is minion incarnation, as per Orion design (see previously discussed material). Even if the aliens were not returning, the planet would collapse. Why would the alien genetic scientists allow this to happen? One option is the feared and rarely mentioned conclusion - the harvest of Earth's population to feed the Orion and Sirian Empires. Earth could be harvested (as shown in the television series \"V\") and the alien genetic scientists create a new human minus the perceived flaws in abundance in the current versions occupying Earth today. This is definitely one of the options that I've called Wild Cards. The Earth Spirit is very troubled and shim is speeding up Earth Changes. Some recent ones are the eruption of Mexico's huge volcano, earthquakes in El Salvador and on up the Pacific coast, plus lots more. Observers (Final and Very Advanced Incarnations) can read the signs and know the end of the world as we've known it is at hand. As I said last year, the Wild Cards are ready to be played. Only the naive will cling to the illusion of 'life will go on as it is'. Time is on the side of the Observers because the Observers have put incarnational life in its proper place as just another experience. Reptilian Infighting and Election 2000 As discussed in other material here, it was the combination of Orion and Sirian genetic scientists who brought Earth humans to the spiritual challenge accepted by many Higher Selves. Back on Ancient Earth, the genetic scientists' uniforms had the symbol of the serpent on them. The serpent has played an important role in Earth mythologies, but is always connected to the reptilian aliens. When a reptilian royal, in charge of the Orion queen's interests in this solar system, decided to start her own rule independent of Mintaka, she became the rebel queen. There would be no change in policy toward Earth (whether rebel or Mintaka queen ruled) and its M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

The rebel queen split from Orion during the reign of Atlantis and the sinking of Atlantis brought the end, temporarily, of Mintaka rule over all Earth. Egypt, a colony of Atlantis, was dedicated to the rebel queen. The 'goddess' Isis is the chief Orion genetic scientist who became the rebel queen. The serpent on pharaoh’s crown was the symbol of the genetic scientists from Orion. The rebel queen's original center was Egypt, which fell to Alexander the Great, who did NOT replace the religion but kept it intact. Even those who ruled Egypt after Alexander's conquest were devoted to Isis. While Alexander did his thing, the rebel Sirian allied with the rebel queen was busy in Rome. The legend of Romulus and Remus raised by the wolf (Sirius) depicts wolfish Sirian involvement. Notice, though, the stress is on a female wolf - alliance with the female rebel queen. If it were of the Sirian throne (allied to Mintaka), a male wolf would have been used as the guardian of Romulus/Remus. Egypt and Rome were allied. Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony were Earth representations of Sirius' rebel royalty with Cleopatra representing the rebel Orion royalty. The rebels have never been able to rest since the system coup. Although rebel factions have been dominant most of the past several thousand years, Mintaka factions have been becoming more assertive especially in the 20th century since the Mintaka queen is expected to return. World War II was a fight between rebel queen fascist factions and socialist Mintaka factions. The Mintaka throne's faction started to assert itself through the catholic church. The mythological mother of mythical jesus, mary, is the representation of the Orion queen. The protestant split from Rome mirrors the rebel split from Orion. Since that split, 1 don't know if you can find a catholic church that doesn't have the statue of mary (Orion queen) standing ('crushing the head') of the serpent (rebel queen-genetic scientist) while both stand on planet Earth. The catholic church's steady elevating of mary shows the intended return of the Orion queen. The current pope's insistence of mary's supremacy over jesus is quite easy to see. He talks about mary and jesus. The protestants have been clashing ideologically with the catholics ever since the split and are fully set against mary-worship as this favors the Mintaka queen over the rebel queen. Now with the crisis of the US election 2000 for president, the factions are clashing in another arena. Bush and Gore each represent a different faction, however BOTH represent reptilian interests on Earth. Baring a MAJOR event, the Orion card is in play and the queen is returning to take overt control of Earth. The Bush family has much closer ties to the British throne which Robert Morning Sky has said is the Nin-hur-sag (representative) of the rebel queen on Earth. The right wing is rebel queen supportive to the left wing supportive of Mintaka. BOTH factions are bad for Earthers. It's a matter of which poison do you choose - arsenic or venom. The shooting at many alien craft trying to enter Earth's atmosphere, when not identified, is typical of the rebel queen's faction since the Mintaka faction has been slipping agents to Earth for quite a while, as have other non-related factions.

Although this greatly simplifies a very complex issue, you get the drift. Infighting between Orion and rebel reptilian factions continues like 2 dogs fighting over a bone called Earth. By some groups referring to ‘Faction 1’ or ‘Faction 2', they refuse to go to the root of both factions. It’s not the Mafia, religion or security agencies that are the root. They are arms of the factions, but not the factions' rulers. Researchers fear to dig too deep to face the alien factor due to a false superiority complex inherent in most Earthers and especially Americans. The interesting situation with this election is the severity of the clash between both factions. True, they’ve managed to cause a new division in the US due to this situation, but the clash is indicative of something major to occur that both groups want to control. The Dark and the reptilians DO fight with each other at all times, but to be so public with it is major. I suggest the returning Orion ships to this solar system have a significant role in this and, unless the Andromedan Council intervenes, it could really get messy. Refer again to that Simpson’s episode of Kodos vs. Kang. After that election, the aliens dropped their human disguises and ruled Earth overtly alien and made slaves of the population. Whoever finally becomes president will rule under a dark cloud as those who voted for the other candidate will feel they were robbed. There will be no true winner and half the country will be bitter. It will be interesting to see how this current crisis develops. One more thing about the 2 major factions: It is FAR too simplistic to think there are only 2 factions. Under each faction are several sub-factions. Each sub-faction supports it's senior, but will battle others in the sub-groups under that senior. The 2 major factions are the second level from the top of the pyramid and there are many layers under that. I never said it would be easy! Observation: Election 2002 & The Game Last night (Nov 5) was an excellent example, for observers, of how the Game ensures that it will proceed as planned. I have no doubt the fascists in the White House are goose-stepping in glee today with the results. Emperor Bush has taken control of the Senate who, like the House, will eagerly give him whatever he wants to expand the American Empire. While this can be disturbing to Advanced levels of Higher Self incarnations, remember that it is necessary that the Game moves in certain directions to conclude EndGame. What you should keep in mind is that everyone who voted for fascist Bush supporters is guilty of pulling the trigger on guns or dropping the bombs that will kill in other parts of the world. If civilians die in the US because of this, they were not 'innocent' unless they voted against the fascist Bush cronies. Nevertheless, this is all part of the experience and the Game! Because EndGame must move into an even higher gear, it was necessary for the Dark to win. Those who voted fascist did so fori of 2 reasons: either they are Empire party members or they are minions or Low through Mid levels of progression. These people in the latter categories were manipulated through the use of such keywords as fear, conformity and patriotism. Fear, of course, was the prime drive which is highly effective on minions and Low levels. Even so, most people who could vote didn't vote. There are all kinds of excuses for why they permit the fascists to run rampant over the country, but they are all hollow IF these people complain about the results without exercising their voting ability. As an observer, you should be able (depending on how Advanced you are) to see the interaction of the various players (fascist Dark/Lightsiders, minions, multitudes of Low - MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition 247"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Mid levels, etc) and disect the Game's structures. That the US has been thrust into a full war stance lead by a wanna-be dictator will bring more horrors to the world. As 'Adolph' Bush said 'you are either with us or against us'. Don’t fall for that line of shit! The Americans deserve what they will get either because they actively wanted it by voting fascist or they sat on the sidelines through apathy. This is all the Game! Keep watching...keep analyzing. It’s going to get much worse. Observations: Divide and Conquer CNN European Edition today shows clashes in Nigeria of ethnic battles. One tribe doesn't like another. This has been going on around the world in high gear since the 90’s: Yugoslavian ethnic clashes, Indonesian, Sudanese, Ethopian, etc. In the USA, increasing divisions based on language, race, sexual orientation, religion, politics, gender (caused by females), etc. Europe has similar divisions, although more racial and religious than the myriad of American divisions. \"United We Stand\" says the bumper sticker on the car next to mine in the parking lot. Well, Americans have not been (mostly) united since WWII (and there were problems there too). The rest of that saying is \"Divided We Fall\". We ARE divided. We WILL fall. Fundamentalist Christians hate everyone not like them and they form the core hate group in the USA from a religious point as do people who wrap themselves in the flag - extremely intolerant. Why all this division, especially in the USA, the (false) land of the free? The Americans united are the most formidable nation on Earth today. This is well known to the rulers of the world. On one level, in order to form the One World government they desire, they know the Americans would never agree and stand in their way. This is why American rulers (elected officials) have been pandering to minority elements under the banner of tolerance. It's not for tolerance, it's for division of the population. The Middle East is going to explode. Israel's pompous leader openly wishes the death of the Palestinian leader. This one hates that one who hates the other one. Islamics hate Jews who hate them back. Christians hate everyone not like them and the polarities are in their 7th heaven for it. Take language in the USA, the Tower of Babel example. To divide a people, you break up the common language, in this case - English. Instead of making English the official language of the country, divide it with lazy Spanish speaking peoples. By lazy, I don't necessarily mean not willing to work (although that is changing), but that they refuse to learn the language of the country they come to live in. They don't want to be American, they want to keep their language intact and make Americans learn it and be like them. There are some states that give driver's licenses in MANY different languages. If I wanted to live in a country whose language I didn’t speak, it would be my prime resolve to learn that language. Why can't these foreigners do the same? The answer lies with minions. Unfriendly alien craft in and around the planet and the return of the Orion Empire are another level for the divisions on the planet, although these divisions can vanish in the face of a much greater threat. But with alien technology, there is zero chance of effective resistance. Remember ALL non-Earther Higher Self incarnates are playing the Game AGAINST Higher Self Earther incarnates (refer to M5 and M5 supplemental materials).

On a third level, the hate & divisions are feeding lower astral entities who are enjoying a banquet of negative vibrations almost all around the globe. These entities will do whatever they can to encourage negative vibrations which Dark astrals feed on. Yep, Earth is VERY messed up and will get WORSE. This is part of Dark's plan of 'if I can't have it, no one else will have it either' - scorched Earth. I told Val about that over a year ago. It's very Orion & Sirian Empire attitude-wise. What's a Higher Self incarnate to do? Depends on your level of Advancement. If you are in the Very Advanced levels, Dominant or Awakened Final, you KNOW what YOU must do: gather experiences and observe. You learn a lot from observing. You do NOT fight the Game. Pointing fingers at the Game's players is part of observing. It is not fighting the Game as you are only identifying the elements of it. The Game MUST be allowed to proceed on its own course. It will end because of itself, not because of any polarity. If you are an Awakened Final (VERY few of these around), you do NOT use your energies to attack the system. You observe and tag what you see, from the very Dark George Bush & cronies to the obscure person who does a kindness because they want to and not because some god or group tells them they must. For those of you on other various levels, you will experience what YOUR Higher Self desires through your incarnation. In some cases, it will be to act against the Game (never an Awakened Final incarnation though & you WILL know why when you are there). It's your experience, after all, and that is the main purpose of the Game. People think Sept 11 was bad. It's going to get MUCH worse! The police state is shadowing the USA as the people give their power away to Washington. Enjoy what you can now. Now won't last forever. There will be those of you with the Atlantis Syndrome, the 'it'll go on forever' attitude that the Atlanteans had even on the day the islands sank. This is the body talking. The body will override an immature spirit. The body talks about expanding the species. The body is ruled by alien DNA commands in these areas. When you have reached Awakened Final Incarnation, you tell the body to 'fuck off. It's always better when the spirit drives the body rather than the body driving the spirit (low, mid and below Very Advanced levels). If it is your Higher Selfs desire that your incarnation be swept up in the high dramas of today, so be it. For those beyond that point, continue to observe, tag and make personal judgments using your intuition. You can totally trust YOUR Higher Self. Divide and conquer is in full swing. Earth is a planet of victims. The stage is set for the victimizer. Know that it will all end and the end is near. Assisting Orion DNA Commands The woman on the television 'health' spot says both women AND men are victims of domestic violence but (I knew this was coming) 95% of those on the receiving end of the 'domestic violence' are female. That is totally untrue. I don't doubt that 95% of the REPORTED domestic violence is to the female, but then how often do males report violence by females to the authorities? If true statistics were kept, you'll find that it’s pretty much 50-50 and, if anything, it will continue to increase with females committing more and more violence. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 249"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"This is part of the Orion DNA command for a matriarchy based on the Orion model. Orion reptilian females are very violent and subdued their males eons ago. Now that the Orion queen is returning to Earth, it is necessary (from their point of view) that Earth mirror Mintaka as much as possible since it will be an openly part of the Orion Empire. The DNA structure placed in the genetically created genders had delay activated segments, as discussed elsewhere. Part of this dealt with female dominance and male subservience. If you've seen the Jerry Springer show, you've seen minion and low incarnations going at each other. Minion and low incarnations are completely body ruled and it's easier to see the new DNA commands in operation. Unfortunately, the spirit must be quite strong to resist these commands and shim doesn't get strong enough, until the VERY Advanced stages and the Final Incarnation, to be able to control the body's structure and break from the conform mode. Television and film constantly reinforce the female dominance/violence commands. Laugh tracks when the female slaps, kicks, punches, etc the male in sit-coms. This female violence is on the increase due to the DNA commands. Do you ever hear a laugh track today if a male returns the violence? No, because you are being conditioned to accept female violence as the way it is...as in the rest of the Orion Empire. Violence is not limited to only physical, but also mental. The controlling partner who threatens to leave if not obeyed, withholds sex/sleeps in a separate room if not obeyed, gets ‘pissy’ if not given the material possessions wanted, and so on. The purpose is to dominate and control the other. Females have become experts at this. While victimizing the male thusly and then the male reacts to it, she always turns around and says 'look how badly he treats me' when she is the cause. Yes, it does happen both ways, but the tide of events has the female side on the increase. The Canadian law giving females unheard of special status if they claim 'abuse' is just one of the new Orion models taking hold. This law is on the Leading Edge site. Greek poet and philosopher Virgil said, \"Foolish is the man who trusts a woman\". Virgil was at least a very Advanced incarnation. It can also be said 'foolish is the woman who thinks she can change a man\". There ARE advanced males AND females, it's just that the overwhelming majority are body and therefore Orion controlled. This is increasing around the world, but is centered in the US. You can still find remote areas where women are women, but this is shrinking by design. Unless you are a Dominant or Final Incarnation, you probably won’t be able to handle this, but my material is for the VERY Advanced who will resonate with it. Violence is unacceptable. People, both men and women, live with it every day. Victim becomes victimizer...a nasty cycle. A truly MAJOR event will be needed to break this cycle.

It's like an infestation that continues to grow. This is according to the Orion plan and the evil nature of the female will continue to progress in this line until ALL their goals are met. Females demand power and control and want men to take the role of females of the 17th century and earlier. Unfortunately, almost all men are going along with this, as per their Orion DNA commands. I'm ready to check out. There is nothing short of reconstructive DNA procedures that will end this since even if there is a wonderful cataclysm, the surviving females will still press their agenda. Better to end the nightmare and cleanse the whole planet. This WILL happen, according to Robert Monroe's visit to Earth's future as well as my own. Victimhood There is a sub-polaritv within the Dark and the Light polarities. This is the victim and the aggressor. Victimhood is very popular, especially in America, these days. EVERYONE seems to want to be a victim. Dark side ‘victims’ are the lackeys, servants of their superiors. Light side ‘victims’ are those who ‘turn the other cheek’, follow their superiors because they are “deity-chosen.” More could be said on these, but you get the drift. IF YOU ARE A VICTIM, YOU WILL ATTRACT AN AGGRESSOR. The victim female or male - always in a bad relationship, always giving, always subservient, always feeling sorry for self and looking for external saviors. Light side superiors LOVE to appear as saviors. Light side victims get into victim groups. Dark side superiors LOVE to play the needed role as aggressor (you can’t have a victim unless there’s an aggressor). Dark side lackeys love to assist their superiors in making the victim feel like a victim. Victim and aggressor are opposites. In order to do away with the aggressor attitude, the victim MUST give up the victim mentality and merge with the aggressor attitude to regain their power. Once the victim is gone, the aggressor is gone. Aggressors ONLY seek out victims. American society encourages victimhood. You should ask why and what is there to gain. Since the world is Dark-controlled, and balance must be satisfied, the more victims in the world, the more aggressors. The upcoming New Reality' will NOT have any victims. Those who STILL desire to be victims will not participate in the New Reality, but will reincarnate somewhere where they can continue playing this power game. Americans love to blame everything but the obvious for events in their lives. It’s the school’s fault, it’s the neighbors’ fault, it’s the government’s fault (true, but for different reasons), it’s the <who/whatever’s> fault.

Those who DON’T say “it’s not my fault” and “I can’t help it” are spiraling away from this prison planet. When I hear, “What could I do, I had no choice”... bullshit. You HAD a choice to do it or not. There’s always a choice. Victims say the “I had no choice” sentence. Balance-oriented people say, “1 had a choice and chose this”. I told a smoker he chose to smoke. Yes, he did, but still not out of the victim mode (although he’s making attempts to rise above it), he still refuses to accept responsibility. I can’t see why not, who forced a non-smoker to be come a smoker? He CHOSE it. He has to live with his choice. When I heard “Boy, I wish I got that promotion a long time ago so I would have had the money to buy Y2K supplies.” I said, “if you weren’t smoking, you would have been able to buy supplies.” He responded, “that’s ONLY $3o/week”. Yeah, $30 that could have been used to buy supplies or other things. Victim and his ‘oh poor me’ attitude. This applies to so many people who refuse to take their power back. AND don’t give me the old chestnut, “you don’t understand how hard it is to quit”. Well, who told you to START! Your body told you not to be getting sick when you tried to, but your CHOICE to poison yourself, limit your psychic abilities was your choice for stupid reasons (usually to impress someone not worth trying to impress). Always go back to the source and see it was your decision. You are experiencing the consequences of your decision. If you can’t admit and see that, you will remain a victim. Until vou accept vour responsibility, you will not be able to heal yourself. I see all these victims every day. Victimhood is comfortable for them because the Light- siders are there to encourage them (it’s societies fault, his/her fault...but NOT yours). IF YOU WANT TO PROGRESS, YOU MUST TAKE YOUR POWER BACK AND SHUN THE VICTIM TRAP. If you complain about anything, this does NOT make you a victim unless you look for external salvation. When I hear complaints now, I say, “Ok, now what are you going to do about that?”. Big Mary the lesbian complains to me about her roommate. I listen and say what are you going to do about it. She says “what can I do?” I told her throw the bitch out. “No, I can’t do that”. What she’s telling me is she’s looking to carry her victim status around like a cross looking for sympathy while she does nothing about it. Pure Victimhood. I told her if she’s not going to do something, take her power back and progress, I don’t want to hear it. Another whines to me about some clown. I give my opinions and suggestions. They are not what he wants to hear and comes back with the ultra-lame ‘you just don’t understand’. Yes I do. I understand he enjoys being the victim and doesn’t enjoy when I don’t play the Light- side hand-holder part. When I suggest actions that require the giving up of victimhood, he won’t hear it. So I say “don’t mention it and you won’t have to hear my comments.” Victims - what pains they can be when they drag their crosses around in front of you, weeping and wailing, but refusing to drop their cross! The “I-love-to-suffer” syndrome! Victims do NOT want to be told how they can correct their choice. They get indignant if you suggest ways in which they can take their power back.

Someone who has been living a life of a victim may decide to take back his or her power at any time. If they want to throw off their cross, they will show it with actions, not just words. Words come all too freely, but to escape from the victim trap, actions on the part of the person are REQUIRED. We all know people who tell you their sob stories. When they are told how to begin repairing them and regaining their power, you get ‘I can’t do that because of this reason or that reason’.

Don’t Be Deceived - Polarities On The Move I received an email about the so-called 'ascended masters of Light' being on the move and ‘descending from their lofty towers in the far East’. The Lightsiders tuned into this have their hearts all-aflutter in the belief that ‘Earth will be shifted to the Light polarity’. I'm sure that Dark will say, ok, if that's what you want, we'll just disappear. The Light says there is some ‘rare stellar alignment that will herald their time’. Don't be deceived! For every supposed 'ascended master of Light' is an equally powerful 'ascended master of Dark'. Balance requires this, as I've said in previous writings. Earth has been in control by the Dark for a LONG time and they will not go gracefully. The Light propaganda machine is churning and, thereby, fueling the Dark as one polarity feeds off the other. r ] We are in the years of grand deceptions, arrivals of false 'ascended masters’ and similar events. Notice how these 'ascended masters' all require followers and minions. A TRUE ascended master would never allow these nor would this person allow self to be surrounded by adoring minions. Nevertheless, both Light and Dark power points not only allow this but J also encourage this. It’s one thing to pass on knowledge, but to allow and encourage (rather than discourage) cults of personality shows they are not the 'ascended masters' they are passing themselves off as, but rather shepherds looking for sheep...and sheep are mindless followers. This is why the Christians look to be sheep...lead and we will mindlessly follow. This goes for the New Age religions and 'ascended masters'. There is only one source that is pure for you, your own Higher Self. You can get input from others, even some great ideas, but the path each Higher Self takes is unique to shimself. Earthers look for conformity (misery loves company). Your Higher Self could have you experiencing events that make others shudder. It's not their place to condemn or to judge as it's not their path. Even showing someone a less painful way usually doesn't work, even if they come to agree with you later as they needed the pain as part of their growth. Stick with the Laws of the Universe and you can't go wrong. For guidance, connect with your Higher Self, for shimself is your true guardian 'angel' or guide and, therefore, the LAST focal point that the polarities want you to connect with.

Light polarity pays lip service to the Higher Self, but they keep you looking to external rather than internal controls of your life's path. What to do with the upcoming Light and Dark pony shows? Sit back and watch...observe. If you feel you must participate, it's part of the pain you need for your own Higher Selfs growth. As for this Final Incarnation, it's observe and study reactions. Strengthening the Polarities Sadism cannot exist without masochism. Masochism cannot exist without sadism. That the Dark polarity uses overtly nasty methods to strengthen their position is a given. The Light polarity reacts to this by 'loving' their enemy (who really ISN’T their enemy, just their alien- split 'other half). The Light polarities have been beating that “love-the-Dark-side” band like it was the end of the world as they knew it (hmmm). I know former teachers who have lost themselves to the Light side and refuse to defend themselves when attacked...just send 'love'. I read a piece from a group that leaves a bitter taste in the mouths of those who KNOW, that, among other things, said something to the effect that “love is like hot coals to the Dark and sends them away screaming.” NOT IN THE LEAST! I have seen, as a shaman, first hand how the ethers work when Dark attacks and Light responds with 'love'. The only 'hot coals' they form are the coals to stoke Dark's fire by reveling in Light's weakness. Sending 'love' to the Dark actually feeds their sadistic desires even more, because they see you as an easy target and one who will roll over for their attacks. When I was called on by this Light side former teacher of mine to assist her (cause she only sends love to the Dark now), I went over and found the Dark literally crawling all over her property and place. I cleaned them out with the only method Dark understands - force...and they went flying out of there like bats out of hell. When I was done, this former teacher was safe, at least for the moment. Why did she call on me to help? Because Light's love didn't work...and it never will against Dark. It just encourages them. If love was so powerful, why did the US send armies into WWII? Instead they could have loved Hitler and company. Yeah, right. If love is so powerful, why doesn't love drive the reptilians mad with trying to get off the planet? Cause it doesn't work that way. Love is a very wonderful vibration, one that should be generously used to those who deserve it and who have earned it. Light only cheapens the vibration by blanketly trying to 'convert' Dark. It won't work. If 'all there is, is love', you have imbalance. Love is countered by hate, two sides of the same coin. Bring the love and hate into the refinery to melt and make the wonderful Balance emotion, which has no English word to describe it. Monroe used the word 'loosh', due to no proper word being available. So, anyone who pushes the “love the Dark” is actually assisting the reptilians and their Dark allies in keeping the planet down. Dark respects strength and lack of fear. The Christians fear and love their 'god', according to them. Sure they do. Since their 'god' is a reptilian (no matter WHAT the Christians may say, it is what it is), yes, their 'god' needs to feed off their fear and their 'love' of “that which they fear” that makes them open to Dark attack. What's a sadist going to do if there is no masochist to “play with”? What's a masochist going to do if there is no sadist to punish and use them, “poor sinners” they are? Think about it.

They actually have to go through a MAJOR spiritual transformation to join them back. This has to be done on an individual level by your Higher Self, once it has advanced to a certain level. It is not in the interest of those in charge on 3rd density Earth to have this material known. It is very advanced. It will eventually overcome the polarities. Neither Dark nor Light desire this because they dance ^ to the reptilian song both on 3rd and 4th densities. Victimhood Revisited The sharp observer notices how many people and several groups alternate between being victims and victimizers. This tactic favors taking on the role of victim first to appear justified when they become victimizers, which is the position of control over others. Once they become victimizers, they will not hesitate to flip back to victimhood if their position of Dark dominance is threatened. These are all facets of the Game. Here’s a short list of the most notorious victim/victimizers. 1. Females - The champions of 'do what I say and not what I do'. Since Orion DNA dominance activation in the 19th century, they have learned to become quite brazen in their goal for dominance. Using true inequalities of the past, such as voting rights and equal pay for equal work, females have continued to cling to victimhood status whenever they don't get their way. In order to continue their march to dominance, they continue to manipulate weak men and wave equality flags when true equality is what they fear and would never allow. Final incarnations, male and female, do NOT get involved with this very Dark segment of the Game. Remember the first 2 laws of the Universe. The females' “need to have gifts” always given to them is a minor mirror of the Orion queen's need to have tribute. If this is not a regular feature in their life, today's female takes on the victim role while victimizing the male in her life. You are labeled a misogynist whenever you disagree with the female agenda. This is just a method of tiying to get you to conform and put you on the defensive. Those who choose to walk in this snake pit have many lessons to learn. 2. Christians - These groups have been victimizing millions since they organized under Constantine. Countless millions have suffered and died at the hands of these master victimizers. It was the Crusades that turned the Middle East vicious. Christians ravaged the American native population. Christianity has been the bane of sanity in the world for almost 2000 years. Nevertheless, they do not hesitate to wear the mantle of victim if anyone criticizes them irregardless of the never-ending onslaughts by Christianity of those who disagree with them or live lives outside of Christian draconian rules. When a Christian toots the freedom of religion horn, they ONLY mean freedom to propagate their brand of poison. 3. Israel and the Jews - Israel is to the Palestinians what the Germans were to them in the 30's-40's. The victims of the WWII era have become the victimizers in the Middle East. The over use of the word 'anti-semitism' has been perfected by American Jews who revel in being victims since they've discovered they can get their way, just like the other groups, if perceived as victims. Anyone who disagrees with Israel or Jewish position is labeled an ‘anti-semite’. This is a control term used by victimizers to make themselves appear as victims. Yes, there are true anti-semites such as the Klan and neo-Nazis and anyone who hate ONLY because of their personal religious belief People are free to believe what they MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 255"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"will, but when they try to force it on others, then they have problems. Unlike the Christians who try to coerce others to their beliefs, the Jews do not. But the Jews, like the Christians, do claim sole connections to the non-existent 'god' and this deity's will. However the overuse of the term anti-semite places them on this list. 4. Blacks - This group is next on the list of self-appointed sacred cow victim/victimizers. Far too often, blacks have been true victims and their victimizers have always been Christians. Can you think of any non-christian group that has a history, in America or Europe, of victimizing the blacks, that wasn't Christian? Yet the blacks still mostly cling to this corrupt religion. You would think they'd have learned from being victims in the past to not being victimizers in the present. For example, they can say whatever they wish about whites (victimizer mode), but get highly offended if the same is done to them ('victim'). They have yet to learn if you say things with the intent of being offensive (cracker, whitey), then don't be surprised when you are treated in kind (nigger, etc.). The same with disagreements and decisions. How often is heard \"blah, blah, blah because I’m black\" as the excuse for something that covers up one's lack of knowledge, competence or a simple disagreement. One’s race has nothing to do with it, but one’s insecurities love the false victim way out. 5. Hate Crimes Laws - The US Bill of Rights guarantees ‘freedom of speech’. With the mountains of laws in this country for every major, minor, petty and ridiculous versions of assault, why the push for punishing people for what they think/say? It’s part of the alien plan to remove freedoms and even the appearance of freedoms. The list of victims begging to be included, in the bill to end freedom of speech, grows each year. First it was the blacks, now it’s women (no surprise there), religion (read Christians and jews) and gays. There are many things that shouldn't be said, but freedom of speech guarantees you can. The huge amount of minion incarnations mixed in with low level incarnations mean the vast majority are body (therefore emotionally) ruled and do not seem to have the capacity to walk away from words. These, however, are superficial reasons for hate crime bills. Whereas blacks, women and religions enjoy being victims, gays do not. Since laws in may states are not enforced when the object of the crime is gay, this group feels it must get on the hate-crimes bandwagon. They are deceived by those ruling the planet. They do not see the big picture and only look for a fix to their valid, poor situation. They need to rise above the cloud of victimization and not become as the power hungry women or the seemingly eternal victims/victimizers like the Christians. Another group that has valid persecution status besides gays is Native Americans. The others, for the most part, are just a bunch of “oh poor me's”. There are other groups who see the perceived advantages of alternating between victim and victimizers. This is a large part of the Game’s rules of ‘divide and conquer’. The seed of all this is alien and the Dark polarity. Also remember that by observing these and other elements of the Game, you are far more able to spiral out of it. You are NOT your gender or your race. You are an incarnation of your Higher Self having a human experience. The true object is to regain knowledge of who you really are and suppress the body's will in favor of the spirit.

This will not be permitted, although the polarities will attempt to do so, believing that they just haven't found the right 'formula' to extend their will yet. The polarities also realize that the Higher Selves have turned the Dark plot against Earth into a rapid advancement course of simultaneous incarnations.'The Higher Selves have turned what, on the surface, seems a miserable situation (The Game) and made it a much faster acceleration of spirit than the sequential incarnations of alien lives. This does not sit well with the polarities who seek to control and divide. This is also behind the Orion consideration of wiping out human life on Earth and re-creating a new human life with all the Orion perceived 'flaws' eliminated. The graduated Higher Selves are adding to the talent pool of beings resisting the expansion of the polarities. What has the polarities on edge is they know that once the densities begin to pull up, they will eventually be absorbed into Balance. For example, when the 3rd density ceases to exist, polarities will lose their major playing stage. Just like Princess Leia said in Star Wars, the more the Dark tightens it's fist of control, the more systems will slip through their fingers. This does not stop the polarities, but instead makes them more frantic in looking for the always-elusive 'correct' formula for extension into higher densities. The panic of the polarities is mirrored in the fear of the Orion hierarchy of dying, which is why the Queen on Mintaka is cloned and given life-extending drugs. Polarities greatest fear is the end of polarities and THAT is the Higher Selves greatest expectation. Something more for you to consider. Vampiric Religion We are all familiar with stories of how people are buried and come back from the dead as vampires, ghouls or other undead. Well, on so-called Good Friday, the dead body was supposed to be placed in the grave and tomorrow, it rises from the deadjust like a vampire. Even though the story is myth, far too many people believe it was literally true. So the vampire rises tomorrow, forms his coffin (church) and continues to suck the money, spirit and lives of the people who are foolish enough to believe in him as he has done for almost 2000 years. Knowledge is the garlic that is guaranteed to kill this vampire if he tries to get into your life or you wish to kill him (again) from your life. Knowing what he is (or better yet-isn't), the purpose of his many churches (as common as saloons in America) and how his priesthood steals away the lives, souls and money of his followers is like cutting off 4th density reptilians from their feeding frenzy. Good Friday is a great day to show your independence by eating meat. Unfortunately, once the vampire sticks his fangs into you, you become his slave (sheep). Even so, only the sheep can free himself. No one else can 'save' the sheep. You can offer to inform the sheep. Offer to give the sheep the garlic (knowledge) to free himself from the vampire, but unless the sheep’s spirit is strong enough to break free, it will be to no avail. If a former object of the vampire breaks free, they become fierce in trying to get others to hold on to the garlic of MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Easter is the day they believe the vampire rises from his grave. It will be a good day to have the garlic (knowledge) handy to truly celebrate your freedom (if so) from the vampire by reading The Handbook or other works that keep you free of the Return of the Vampire into your life. The vampire's minions are persistent and the lure of the vampire (conform) is a sedative, so hold close to your garlic. Once you become strong enough, they can never lure you away! Observations: “Woman’s Awareness” I don't know if there is such a month as 'Women's Awareness Month', but it should be Women's Awareness EVERY day. Why? Because, although women are aware of their nature, they become veiy defensive and vile to any man who knows it or comes close to discovering it. Women use outright lies and denials to hide the truth of their nature. Misogyny is a word for \"the hatred of women\". This is a term women love to use, but the definition is incorrect. The above definition is coined by women. Misogyny is better defined as one who is aware of the nature of women and deals with them accordingly. This doesn't mean, just because you know their nature (as you know the nature of spiders, snakes, cats, fish, etc) that you can't be friends with them. Knowing their nature means you understand their manipulative nature and other intricacies. For obvious reasons, they don't like it if you call them on their nature. What is...is. A fish can't be a rock. They almost always, in order to take the attention away from themselves, will try and reverse it to you and put you on the defensive (if they can). You must try and resist that ploy. Women have had covert, manipulative control for ages while crying 'oh, poor me' all the while. That's part of their deception. For the past few decades, they've been seeking overt as well as covert control. By slamming men and elevating themselves as better than men, they've whipped (good choice of word) 99% of the males into believing their propaganda. Now it's common to hear men (especially white men) demeaning themselves in favor of women. The female propaganda has been working. This, of course, has it’s origins in the return of the Orion Empire's intended open control of Earth and the Orion Empire is dominated by reptilian females. The vast majority of men (both het and gay) will fall for the female manipulations. The local gay group here has many who want to cater to the lesbians. See, it doesn't mean that the sex act is the aim here, it is deference to the female who doesn't want to be treated equally, but rather as better. This week, for example, a female pulled into a reserved parking spot. She came out and said, \"I guess I'll have to move this. Where can I park?” I pointed across the street to the gutter. She sighs, gets in her car and asks, \"Can you help me get out of here?\". I said, \"No, you got yourself in, you can get yourself out\". Of course she did and she knew she could. BUT the purpose of the ’helpless woman' ACT is to control. Boy, was she barking (mooing) up the wrong tree! Another item: why do females always expect males to buy things for them?

Men don’t need to have things continually bought for them, but women do, like whores/prostitutes, except with whores/prostitutes you pay them for a service and that’s it. With the females men live with, they're always paying and mostly get varying degrees of grief and more demands. It's their domineering nature at work and their succubistic nature draining the male. Man's best friend is a dog (loving). A woman’s ‘best friend’ is a diamond (materialistic). It gets me when some female is foaming at the mouth, as they do almost daily, while wearing a shirt or top with hearts and roses on it. Those shirts are part of putting men off guard. A woman will do almost any manipulative thing they can to get a man to bend to their will, and the stupid men bow to it. Some females are bossy and domineering about it, some are clever and subtle, but the nature is the same. The talk radio station yesterday (a man and a woman host) said that “gay men don't have the 'benefit' of a woman telling them what they can and can't do and how they can/can't live.” Whip cracking! Why can't a woman be happy being a woman? Why does she want to be a man? They chose the incarnation of a woman for a female experience. Instead they trv and change the experience. There are far more genetic flaws in th e female physical than the male. The female knows that the male is the source of life and that irks them, so they try and steal the role from him through deceit. You can be an advanced spirit and have female incarnations. If you are and do, you will admit the nature of the female IF the spirit controls the physical. If the physical controls the spirit, forget it. Even so, I'm sure these advanced ones exist. They do NOT do the 'oh poor me' routines. They do NOT seek to be men. They do NOT play the games females constantly play. Women and men are incompatible. This was known since the genders were first created by the meddlers. Since the meddlers created the genders, they consider themselves to be owners of Earth's inhabitants. All the grief we have today comes from that original splitting of genders and the continued genetic manipulation by alien groups. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OVERALL FOR THESE SPLIT HUMANS TO HAVE ALL BEEN DESTROYED AND THE SPIRITS ALLOWED TO FIND OTHER MEANS OF EXPRESSION. Due to the energy friction between male and female, an aware/mature male will keep females at a distance. Yes, you can still be friends with them but you must set parameters for them not to cross (but they’ll try anyway - it's their nature). You must be strong, but if you are that advanced spiritually, you already are, ONCE you've learned. If you reveal their nature directly to a female, you likely will get the tired old chestnut, ’you hate women’. Another counter-attack to draw you away from them and to yourself. Don't fall for that one. For those of you who have not advanced to the higher stages yet, you will continue the mistakes of the past UNTIL you learn. Like the guy who got married, gets divorced (from the bitch), then seeks to do it all again. That’s the circular cycle that you’re doomed to follow until YOU break the cycle, as with all cycles. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 259"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Females are becoming more and more oppressive. They do all manner of vile things to males. But if males did any of them to the female, they scream 'sexual harassment'. Again, the bogus female way of disarming a justified male event. Will men ever wake up and backlash? I don't know. The females won't stand for it. Power corrupts them even further, the Orion way. Never forget, females will search for the ideal w'ay to manipulate a man. The only deception to this is the one she gives you and the self-imposed one you have. Breaking the cycle means just that. You must realize that you DON'T need the opposite gender. The need is artificial. Females would be horrified to see these secrets in print and would use all their manipulations to get a man not to read it or pay it any mind. It's so much easier for them to try and get you to pay attention to your 'insignificant, inadequate' male nature. If they tell you this enough, you will likely believe it. The need you hets feel for a woman is artificial and forced by meddlers in your DNA. It is your body, NOT your spirit in control, but it’s your choice to break the control or not. Final incarnations, both male and female, have no difficulty in seeing these observations for what they are. They are the Orion DNA commands moving to completion. Fortunately there is not much time left on 3 rd density Earth. Observations: “Men’s Awareness” Men tend to be very aware of their nature. Men, being the givers of life, have an abundance of energies. When the genders were first created on Ancient Earth, men and women kept apart, knowing the other was wrong for them. Men had sex with men. Women had sex with women. Both were done for pleasure and the sharing of their spirit in a physical way. The meddlers did not like that. They needed slaves to control. So, they altered the DNA even further adding a desire to reproduce. Unfortunately, they needed the female for the egg matrix, which was taken from the original being, for their sperm to develop into another human. Since females cannot create a being, they arranged the female DNA to crave the energy of the male and reproduce. The rest I've covered in earlier writings. Men like being men. Men like to horse around and be physical. Women, jealous of men's independent nature, have always tried to get men to stop being men. \"Don't fight\" \"Stop horsing around\" \"Be like we want you to be\" (read - cast aside your male nature and let us control/guide you to be w'hat WE want you to be). Men are here to develop as a man, not as a woman. You have separate incarnations for that. Once the spirit has matured to a certain degree, it starts to influence the male side to alter to better fit the maturing spirit. The physical behavior becomes increasingly for fun \"I'm going to slap the hell out of you\" \"You're gonna’ get a beating\". This allows the male expression without the primitive destructive violence. Talking about the violence, it’s usually the manipulations of the female in trying to get a man to be like a woman that brings it out. Trying to (usually) verbally assault a man (as they always do) to be something he's not. Then they wonder why the man lashes out at her. As I’ve said, men do not belong living with women. The woman is manipulative. The dominance desire WILL show either openly or in subtle ways, but it WILL be there. When the man explodes on her verbally or physically for her meddling, she bitches to other bitches how horrible the man is for not obeying her. \"What did I do?\" \"What's wrong with MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Females today believe (wrongly) that it's their ‘right’ to do so and they get pussy whipped men to cater to their desire to rule. This is all part of the Orion programming. There is not one man I know who is married or living with a female who is not under her control in one way or another. This is not a partnership situation as it should be, but rather a gender control by one over the other. One guy I know is outwardly dominant and hollers a lot. He married this subtle controller who knows better than to confront the dominant appearing male. I've seen her in action and all the while he's saying “no woman controls him.” Yeah, right. Is it his ego too fragile to admit what is happening? Probably. Why do men stay with these abusive women? Because society demands it, because they fear being themselves, because the body rules the spirit and because the spirit hasn't matured enough to know what is going on - there are also other reasons. Why are all the guys that I've fooled around with - married with kids? Married men are the easiest to play with, but society/religion keeps them, in public, as conforming. I've heard lots about married women doing the same with other women. It's quite natural. Until both men and women can be true to themselves and their natures, problems will continue and get worse since the females are seeing how much crap they can get away with. Then there's men who say 'I'm with a woman because she's spiritually like me' or something to that effect. My question is, if you were going by ‘spirit compatibility’, would you do the same if the spirit was in a male body? Don’t think you're going to pull me in on that deception. If men and women were with people they are compatible with, they’d be with the same gender, the ones they like to hang out with, share their secrets with and have things in common with. Would you even consider making a life with someone based ONLY on the spirit? If you lie, you're only lying to yourself. Men's awareness ... yes, and you have to be true to yourself and not ‘change to impress a female’, because if you do, you're only submerging your true seZ/which WILL pop up again. Getting with someone whose idea is to change you (female mantra) or getting with someone who likes you for the way you are. It’s your choice. What are you going to do?

Testosterone Have you ever heard men say \"There's too much testosterone here\"? No, and you won’t UNLESS they are under direct control of a female, and then they're whipped. Why do we always hear complaints, from females, about testosterone? Why don’t we hear complaints from men about 'too much estrogen'? Because men are happy being men and females are neither happy (as a whole) being female and jealous of the male as giver of life. Testosterone is a direct expression of male energy, an expression of the ability to give life. Some men have high levels of testosterone (read unable to completely control this) and express it poorly. In most cases, it is a spirit having either it's first or very early incarnation as a male. They could have been female in their last incarnation(s), and now want to try male. When in the male body, they have to adapt to the energy that wasn't there as a female. Similarly, someone who has had a string of male incarnations and is having their first female incarnation, realizes what they no longer have in the physical. If they are advanced enough, they enjoy being a female.

Unfortunately, weak and/or whipped males will bow down to the alpha cows. This is connected to the DNA flaws in the male body placed there by the meddlers. Males can thrive in testosterone atmospheres. Like attracts like. Women seek to invade these areas to feed off the male energy and try and control it for their own purposes. Males tend to bond in testosterone areas, and females see this as a direct threat. Males don't care if females bond in estrogen areas and rarely seek to be part of them. But females are constantly seeking to break down male bonding. There is a severe problem with these (majority) females. The desire to control males is Orion. Females fear that if males bond strongly enough, they will not need females. <They really DON'T need them except for breeding purposes - refer to previous writings on this.> When males try to bond, the females try and intrude, always wanting to burden themselves on the males AND, in trying to control them, will try to get them to NOT act like males, i.e. \"Stop fighting\". Females do not understand what is necessary for males and male bonding. Resentment builds as females try and control male bonding, then when the male lashes out at the females, they counter with 'what's wrong with him?'. It's NOT him, it's HER. It's men who have to take back their power from women (woe to men). This doesn't mean to mistreat them, but it does mean to treat them equally and to treat them firmly when they cross the line. It's very popular for females to talk down to males today (Orion again) and express a faux sense of superiority. As long as males allow this, it will not only continue, but grow. When a female is caught crossing the line, she most likely will try to force herself over the line but using guilt, tears, threats and other control methods. If the male is strong, he will ignore these, knowing she has donned the role of victimizer. If you won't be the victim, her control methods have no effect. If you will be the victim, the alpha cow is happy. This also means several incarnations must be used to try and advance both people beyond the victim/victimizer. Men let women be women. Women need to let men be men and overcome female's severe insecurities. However, Earth is now primarily a victim mentality planet where almost EVERYBODY is a ‘victim’ of something. This is another imbalance that must be responded to by a victimizer of equal proportions. It's arrival will be made clear VERY soon. Orion Empire Lackies: Testosterone Wails Today's front page, of regional newspaper where I live, screams, \"One view: 'Too much testosterone'\". This is quoting some unknown attorney who says, \"There's too much testosterone going around\" in the Middle East. First of all, who the fuck cares what some unknown ambulance chaser has to say and, then, why does it appear on the front page? Simple, it’s part of the anti-male campaign by the rulers of the planet to alter Earth for the intended return of the Orion Empire. They figure that most will say 'if it's in the paper, it must be so'. Low Advanced through much Mid- Advanced will light more candles on the altars of their various goddesses (One thing required to enter Very Advanced levels is the abandoning of fantasy deities such as god/goddesses/angels and related fiction.

The anti-male tirades of the cunt-ruled Orion Empire continue at a heated pace as their forces draw nearer to Earth. They want males to feel that all the world's problems are due to them. They want males to submit to the awful sea of estrogen threatening to overwhelm the givers-of-life gender. Since the polarities love the problem-reaction-solution sequence, it's: Problem: men(testosterone) cause war. Reaction: war is bad. Solution: let females rule. This is PURE manipulation in behalf of the Empire and their polarity lackies. In the Orion Empire, males are not permitted to question/counter/challenge female dictates. Yet the female is far deadlier and more vicious than the males ever were. It is illusion that is being spread like manure and the weeds growing from this shit are visible everywhere today. What can be done about it? Really nothing as it is a major part of The Game. You can educate yourself and assist others who are open-minded, but the only actual escape comes from spiraling out of The Game. Therefore you can keep much of The Game away from your individual sphere by not participating in its tirades and by not assisting it in the acceptance of the draconian changes that spread like a cancer. As we are in EndGame years now, it will be interesting to see which Wild Card(s) is/are played to counter these massive controls that the Empire has in place. They WILL be played and they will HAVE to be massive indeed. It can't happen soon enough for me. Keep observing and keep Advancing yourself. Men Must Take Back Their Power The news reports that warfare in country Z is \"killing women and children\". The various movies include the words, \"Save the women and children first\"...and on and on the blather goes. What happened to the men? Why is it OK that men are killed and not rescued? Let me tell you, once your spirit has matured enough through evolution, and you see the Game for what it is, you are repulsed by the rules of the Game and astounded that everyone falls for them. The constant drilling that men are expendable has droned on for far too long. It was one thing when women were happy being women and acted like women, but with the 20th century, they decided they wanted to be like men BUT keep the status women have had. They now wanted the benefits without the equal treatment. This topic has been covered before. The comment I received yesterday from a man who, after reading some of my material, said, 'that's what guys HAVE (my emphasis) to do - anything to keep the woman happy'. I just wanted to scream! This is an ideal example of men giving their power away to women. It doesn't matter who is right or wrong or deserving, just obey the woman. This is giving away of your power, being subservient, just as to obeying the non-existent god/goddess. Giving away one's power means you must reincarnate. Even though we all go through this hundreds of times, once you reach your Final Incarnation, you DO gather all your power and see the Game for what it is. One of your desires is to try and wake up others so they can see the Game for what it is. This can be most frustrating. You MUST reclaim your power to break away from the Game. The giving away of power by a man to a woman is based on an illusion, a lie. It is NOT the man who 'needs' a woman, it is the woman who 'needs' a man. Here I'm talking about non­ gay men and women.

They bear the life the male transfers to them. This has also been previously discussed. (Yes, this whole paragraph can be expanded) Women fear that men, as a whole, will discover the truth about genders and they have tremendous arsenals to keep it hidden and increase their control of men. Going back to the root of this abomination, you find Orion Empire genetic scientists. Remember, the Empire is female ruled and dominated. The Orion belief is that males are controllable and expendable. This has manifested on Earth starting with American females. The Orion queen is pleased. This belief has been woven into both male and female genetics and encouraged by royal families, the bogus 'lady' on a pedestal crap. Pedestals raise those on it above those below it. No one belongs on a pedestal, least of all because of their gender. Also, alien reptilian shape-shifters have guided the current view of western women to what it is today. This reached high gear in the 20th century due to the planned return of overt control by the Orion Empire of this solar system. One of the main, if not THE main, attribute the aliens fear in us is our spiritual abilities. The male incarnates are the key here. The Empire uses the Earth females to keep males from discovering who they are and turn their creative, life-giving energy into changing the status quo. Earth females have succeeded, so far, in controlling the males for the Empire, except in one case: the gay groups. All the bans on gays and lesbians stem from them only partially being non-breeders on the Empire's human farm. The main reason is to keep these people on the defensive so they don't learn how they can use their power, since gay men cannot be controlled by females and lesbians can't be controlled by anyone. Native American tribes considered a gay tribe member a major blessing as one who walks between both worlds. Gays were considered sacred and defended by all tribe members because their unique spiritual nature allowed them to alter situations in the tribe and for the tribe. Can you see why it was imperative for the European invaders to destroy the Natives or convert them to European controlled ways? I will only teach my best material to people who have reclaimed their power and defer to no one based on gender, age or status. Retaking one's power takes effort and determination, but once it’s regained, you never want to give it away again and you're also ready to spiral out of the Game. For, if you haven't reclaimed your power, you couldn't handle above 4th density. So, be disgusted when you hear of the poor treatment of men, not only because of the women's attempt to keep men away from their power, but mostly because these men allow it to happen. If it's not 'killing people' regardless of gender, it's part of the Game and the Orion master player...and enough is enough! Observations: Why Monogamy? Why monogamy ? The popular bullshit line is 'for the children'. This is a outright fabrication. The 'children' are the excuse. Deities forbid that they might learn their true nature, after all. No, it all revolves around the female's succubistic nature. She insists on monogamy in order to protect her feeding source, the male, from other females. She does MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition 264"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. NOT want to share the pot, so to say. Abundant male energy can easily handle a number of females. The greed of'I want it all' is one of the hallmarks of the female gender. Knowing that they are not givers of life, they've settled for becoming takers of energy and they guard their source jealously. In het males, monogamy is more of a power trip. They really don't need to control the female, as they are as common as flies (but more annoying). The DNA meddlers put that damned reproductive urge in humans and het males see female ‘luring away’ (with energy of another male) as ‘denying the male a chance to reproduce’. This, of course, is all physical body controlling the spirit. Many het males will wave the 'children' flag just as readily as spurned females. It's just their core reason is different. It's been outdated for ages, but still exists. The children in Ancient Earth had very healthy lives - no monogamy and no heterosexualism (no genders). If the spirit controls the body in a het, they will not allow the body to have a jealousy frenzy of mouth foaming and ranting. If they want to be with someone else, let them. If they fear to leave because of the other's ranting, it is Dark side on the part of the controller and victimhood on the side of the controlled. While it's fine to let people be with whom they want to be with, once they've chosen someone other than you, you should cut them off financially. They've found a new person to be with. You should also never take them back. Once they've left you, no matter what they say, they'll do it again. They made their choice. Respect their choice, and they must also respect yours, not to be ‘had’ again. People who are in a marriage that fails, if they continue the cycle, it'll just be the same thing with a new face. In order to progress, you must break the cycle by doing something new. It boils down to monogamy being an artificial control method. The female fight for the male energy can be quite fierce and competitive. That's pure 3d physical. It does not exist in higher dimensions. Aware males are quite selective with who they will feed with their energy. Aware males do not drool over females - that's so body dominant. Aware males are also not limited to females. Needless to say, there are not many aware males on Earth in relation to the population. Aware females, although unable to stop the female succubistic nature, can control it to a certain extent and do not insist on monogamy from the male as long as the male is attentive to her needs, but she must be attentive to his needs as well. Aware females are not limited to male partners. Spiritual compatibility is not limited to opposite gender. If it is, it’s the body talking and mutating the spirit's desires. This is just something more for you all to consider. Observations: Consequences Why is it that so very few people are willing to accept the consequences of their actions? This is a subset of the victimhood mindset. Why do people complain about the consequences but refuse to look at what brought those consequences about? Here are some examples: A) This person (T) invites someone to be at his home at an agreed upon time of 1-1:30. The person arrives at T’s house at 1PM, knocks on the door and no one's home. The visitor pounds the door several times in case T is in the bathroom or asleep. No answer.

The visitor must guess what's going on. Now, the visitor didn't think this was the end of the world, and although disappointed, he knew it'd work out. However, when T's oh- poor-me message is found with attitude, the visitor wonders why T refuses to take responsibility for his action of not leaving a note. It was an act of omission, an act of carelessness, but it was T's action. T complains about the consequences while refusing to see the cause. All T had to do was admit his error and the problem would have gone away. Instead T chooses to make a bad situation worse by 'it's not my fault' and 'I couldn't help it'...it's YOUR fault.

P goes off to the Monroe Institute to learn out of body techniques. While he's there, some woman is bitching about something (isn't that always the case). P decides to offer to do a shamanic journey for her EVEN THOUGH HE HAS NOT BEEN TRAINED TO DO IT! P calls his teacher bragging about what he's done and the teacher is horrified. P has disqualified himself from learning shamanic methods because he abused his VERY limited knowledge and did not follow his teacher's warnings and instructions. P also chooses a mundane/conforming path and the consequences of this decision take him away from his former teacher. P disappears for 18 months, then shows up out of the blue expecting his teacher to act as if nothing happened at Monroe or with his conforming path. P tells the former teacher how he wants to learn 'everything'. The teacher says nothing. P gets upset with the teacher for offering to teach him and then not doing it. Why doesn't P see it was his actions that caused the consequences he's living? When P is told this, P doesn't like it and wants the teacher to share it the blame! Can you believe that! P refuses to see the consequences are there only because of his choices, his decisions to do something that took him away from the learning. But, P says, it’s not my fault - I can’t help it...it's YOUR fault. Poor P, will he ever be able to break the cycle? C) This person (L) makes a decision to live and to support another woman. While L is a lesbian, the other woman claims not to be. L financially supports this woman, but spends much of her time complaining about finances and the woman. I told L for her to kick the bitch out. L replies, \"I can't do that\". So on and so on. L made the choice to do this then complains about the consequences. It's not my fault, I can't help it...it's somebody else's fault. Poor L, will she ever be able to break the cycle? D) One last case is that of C. He wants to learn from a teacher. C is in a bad marriage. C has 2 spoiled brats. C has come to realize that getting married in the first place was a mistake. That is good. He recognizes his error. Recognition is only the first step.

I could give you many more examples, but they all end the same. Even those who read and agree with the material in the Handbook (Vol. 1-3) and make progress in other areas, know this: if you can't accept responsibility for your actions, you have far to go. It is a major spiritual step to be able to say, \"It's my fault/it's my decision\". It's not the decision that is important, for it's just an experience. What IS important is being able to accept that you made the decision and can live with the consequences. If you don’t like the consequences, then it's time to make another decision to alter the consequences. The power lies with YOU. If you give your power away (it's not my fault/I can't help it), then you need to reclaim it. Observations: Trophies When some men go deep-sea fishing and catch a marlin or something big, or even something much smaller, many like having their picture taken with the catch. This picture becomes the ‘trophy’. When a woman gets married, she wants her trophy too, those damned wedding pictures. That’s her trophy AND, more importantly, they litter the house with them, especially the living room and bedroom. This is to remind the man who he belongs to and who has staked claim to his energy. The succubistic nature of women is very jealous in guarding their energy source, especially from other women. They know that women are predators (the reptilian part of them). Females are always seen hanging around males, but always complain about it. Why, then, do they hang with them? It’s their energy which they feed on. They bitch that ‘men should be like women, be subservient to women and let women change them to what they want them to be’. This is very Dark side/controlling, but this is their nature. Go to any area, even a gay bar, and you'll find women hanging around, feeding. They don't need sex to feed, although that's a prime way, at least in order to hook their energy source and stake him. Wedding pictures...do the men, unfortunate enough to get married, run around with their wedding albums. No. It's the female to keep him under her control and warn other females away. Trophies.

Observations: Television Revelation Last night, on VHi, in a half hour interview with Al Yankovik, he was asked why his music deals with food and TV and never women and sex. He said ALL women will drain the life out of a man and it's a matter of finding one who will drain it slower than the others. Boy, did he get that right! However, once you've spiritually evolved enough to realize that, it's NOT a matter of finding one who will ‘drain it slower’ (still unwilling to go the next step to break the cycle), it's a matter of having as little as possible to do with them. Of course we all have hundreds of lives in the heterosexual mess, but the purpose of incarnation is to progress. 267 i"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Once you have reached a certain level, you will realize this and never return to that lower state and the other spirits you're supposed to deal heavily with will be the same gender, thus facilitating mutual growth. If you've reached that level of awareness, you will have prearranged with other spirits to enter the same gender body as you. Until you reach that level of awareness, you will continue to play the Game on the sexual level. Be friendly with females who deserve it, but always be aware that they're looking to feed and stake their claim to a male energy source. This means always (even with a female friend) to keep a certain distance from them and never get too involved with them. Atta’ way, Al Yankovik! MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Observations: Gender Unrest Why is it that women aren't happy being women? I've written several essays on this topic, so here's more for you to think about: Why are women always invading areas where men get together? Why do females try and attach themselves to groups of males? Why can women have female exclusive meeting places, but females insist on violating male exclusive groups? Why is it you don't find men demanding access to female areas as females do to male? Why do females seek to be like males, but males (except for entertainment purposes, i.e. drag queens) do not seek to be like females? Why when you see groups of females together, you don't see male hangers on like you do in male groups with female hangers on? All these questions and more go back to the core explanation: The male is the giver of life and the female is a succubistic incarnation seeking to feed off males and trying to claim one for her exclusive use. Men are quite happy to have female exclusive clubs, colleges, etc. Females are not happy when men want the same - there may be energy they can harvest in that group. Look at the Citadel in the south. Why were these females foaming at the mouth (while wearing hearts, flowers and kittens on their shirts) demanding entry to this all male bastion? The core explanation fits. A secondary explanation is the spirit occupying the female body is dissatisfied with the limitations of the experience. It knows it shouldn't have these limitations (blame the meddlers for splitting Earth humans and creating genders), but it doesn't know why nor does it know (until very spiritually matured) who created the mess. (Even so, it desired the female experience .) Instead, it, in the 20th century, began creating problems by trying to be something (incarnate) that it isn't. This division is part of the manipulation caused by the meddlers and current overseers of Earth to further divide the population and cause disharmony. This is also part of the Orion Empire plan to subjugate males by the females, as in their Empire. The givers of life subservient to the matrix holders. All this fuss is 3rd density big time and carried into 4th density by spirits refusing to see themselves for who they are (non-gendered). This is part of the trap the meddlers have set. They would dearly love it if it could be carried into the 5th density, but that won't happen. When the DNA glitch occurs in the standard human body, you have gays and lesbians. Why isn't the lesbian, a female, seeking out males to recharge themselves? First of all, ALL spirits in either male or female bodies are essentially the same. Think of it as electricity. Plug a device (physical body) into the electric and it works. The spirit gives life to the physical. Some devices can transmit ideas, some can toast bread, some can light rooms, etc. 268"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Each device is different, BUT the electricity is the same. The female Earth body has been created by the meddlers to drain male energy, among other things. When you have the DNA glitch, the program to drain energy from males is negated, thus allowing the spirit's natural inclinations to show unaltered. Due to religions’ (keepers of the meddlers plans) tendency to curse this as ‘unnatural’, much fuss is raised over same-sex relationships. Remember, the Handbook correctly states that a 180 degree shift in attitude is necessary to survive the chaos. It’s not the lesbian woman who is unnatural or corrupted, it is the heterosexual female that is. The lesbian female does not seek to hang out with males as their het counterpart does. The lesbian knows (on a subconscious level) that it does not need the opposite gender and therefore doesn't attempt to steal energy from a male and is repulsed by the thought. The lesbian knows it is self-sufficient, unblocked/unaltered by the meddler DNA commands. Again, and I'm getting tired of saying this, but you, being at your level, need to hear it: we ALL go through the experiences of being in both genders. Progression and spiritual maturity will take everyone (eventually) to where they can see the Game for what it is and see how 3d humans have been manipulated. You will come to see heterosexuality as an unfortunate perversion of the spirit that has caused far too much miseiy because of vastly superior meddler technologies that took advantage of pristine Earth. Meanwhile, non­ lesbian females will go on acting as succubi and denying their spiritual selves to let their physical control the spirit until the spirit matures to the level where it can see the true nature of the Game. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Observations: Advanced Female Verification While visiting a married woman that I know, she commented that what I write about women is true. They usually just ‘don't want to hear it’ or make it common information known to men. She also said with women, a man has to either obey her or amuse her. If not, he is in for difficulties with her. She also said not only that, but they thrive to know ALL secrets and confidences held by a man. When I heard that, I remember what I said just last week, 'if a woman ever agreed with what I wrote about the nature of females, I think the world would crack.' It did on Feb 19, the day of the Full Moon in Virgo! Knowing their nature does NOT mean not associating with them, it does make you aware and cautions you as to how close you might want one to get to you. What I found interesting was that this confirmation and additional info on women came from a married het female and not a lesbian. It is nice to find an advanced spirit incarnating in a female as well! Observations - Abortion The wail and moan over abortion continually raises its head. Most organized religions say a child is 'killed' at any time during an abortion. The majority say it is a woman’s choice to decide what to do with an unwanted pregnancy and avoid commenting on the religious stand. From the information in the Library in the Upper Astral, confirmed by my shamanic perspectives, the spirit does NOT enter the body of a baby until it takes it's first breath. Before then, the developing body is primarily dependent on the mother's system. Even when the heart has formed and beats, it is strictly the body, the physical. Spirits who chose to incarnate have much better things to do than lie dormant in a developing physical for 9 months. 269"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. But, once the body is born, it shudders as the spirit enters the body and forces the first breath. This makes the newborn an individual, which it isn't before that time. So why the fuss over abortion? Remember where it primarily comes from - religion. Who is the founder of religion? The aliens in whose interest it is for the slave race to multiply. It is built into the DNA commands. Preserve the physical. It's 'sacred'. All alien commands. The physical is but a tool for the spirit to be discarded when no longer useful. There can be an unlimited supply of bodies on 3rd density Earth, actually more bodies than higher spirits, but that's another topic. It is a low to upper moderate spirit level that requires the birthing experience. These low to upper moderate levels are controlled by the body. They ARE their bodies. Beyond upper moderate levels start to realize there HAS to be more out of life and turn first to no religion/anti-religion, then to the psychic and occult. The static nature of breeding eventually becomes the boring repetition it is. The higher your spiritual level, the less your body you are and YOU control your physical rather than the other wav around. Abortion should be a woman's choice, not imposed by religion, parasitical women or dynasty-oriented men. The image of'dead babies' is artificial. There is no disgruntled spirit as the spirits KNOW more on higher levels, and are not that fussy on lower levels with regard to incarnating again. The demons the anti-choice crowd raise are, in reality, 4th density reptilian and self-created images, NOT a frustrated spirit whose vehicle he or she was cast out from. Before the first breath, no spirit occupies that body. The anti-abortion mob, just like most Christians, are fear and control based and seek to drag the planet into another Dark Age like the one Christianity created at the fall of the Roman Empire (starting with Constantine the Apostate). Minion spirits incarnating into overabundant physical bodies make excellent followers of religious nuts for they ARE their body and really belong in animal bodies. Since ancient times, Earth's seasons have been divided into winter/male and summer/female. This was based on the purposeful confusion by those aliens when they split the original humans into genders. Before this alien perversion, the residents of Earth not only understood the nature of the planet but the expressions of both its male and its female energies. As the male is the giver of life, this is reflected in nature as the growing season. This occurs in both hemispheres at the opposite times of the year. The matrix female period is winter when it rests from the male season of life and regenerates for the next season. The intentional swapping of the seasons was the alien overlords' attempt to add confusion to the newly created, genderized humans and keep them from learning their spirits' true selves and abilities. The genderization of everything by languages also reinforces the lie of genderization of, not only physical, but spiritual. Male, female and neutral all have their own language expression, but there is no provision for both male and female as that was something NOT to be considered. English is the only major, if not the only planetary, language to drop the genderization of everything. However English still does not have a pronoun for male and female inclusive - he (male), she (female) and it (neither male nor female). This stresses you have to be one or the other or neither, but not both.

This song, from South Park's movie, is full of fucks, farts and similar, but yet it was still nominated for an Oscar (unfortunately it didn't win). These people, who are 'offended' by certain words, can be fun to question as to why they are offended. I asked one woman why she didn't like the word 'fuck'. She said she didn’t like the sound of it. Then, she must also find muck, truck and luck offensive as they sound similar. No? then it's not because of the sound. In every case, they refuse to allow further questioning (even though I know the answers to these questions, I’m forcing them to look at the why’s and look within). Another one: why don't you like the word 'cunt'? She says 'I hate that word'. Why? It sounds terrible. Oh, then you must also hate runt, hunt and bunt. No? Then it’s not because of the sound. These are just 2 examples. It's not the sound of the word, it's the meaning of the word. Look at all the words some people find 'offensive'. They deal with sex and bodily functions/parts, these are things that RELIGION has decided are ’sinful' and 'dirty’. They are, in reality, neither. Sex is a taboo because this is a key to your power, something religion never wants you to regain because then you will realize that religion is a sham and something you never needed. The body functions/parts in the banned list include the genital areas which, of course, have sexual connotations. Does anyone bristle when someone calls someone else a 'heel'? No. but it's a body part! Yes, but an acceptable-to-religion body part. Even many people who claim to be free of religion are timid about using most of these words. This is due to ingrained social/religious programming. This programming must be consciously and deliberately overcome and IT TAKES TIME. You have a genetic history of obedience to religion to overcome. However, once overcome, you NEVER go back. -j South Park has gone far in liberating people from religious programming. Religion will ALWAYS be offended about something. Religion is a dinosaur, a relic of an ancient time no longer needed. You must shed the past to enter the future. You must regain your power to J control your destiny. When told by some religious nut that they don't like your language, tell them you don't like theirs either. All that 'god bless you' crap you have to put up with hearing. Remembering that the 'god' of the bible is a reptilian alien puts a whole new slant on the meaning. I tell them 'god bless you' offends me when I sneeze. That makes them stop. How can anyone be offended by that? Well, how can anyone be offended by fuck? You have to turn their game against them to make them reflect on their own words and knock them off their ivory towers. They seek conformity and control. You should be seeking freedom and your power. 271"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Observations - Fat Is Fabulous Some facts about the role of fat seem to have been forgotten in our rush to be the 'right' weight, which, by the way, nobody yet can tell you. ^Without fat, you would be chained to your refrigerator and you would die in less than 24 hours if you didn't have food. Your fat store, the adipose tissue, is best regarded as a sort of buffer. The amount of fat that goes in and out during an average day is enormous. *Fat acts as a sort of bubble wrap, cushioning many areas of the body from mechanical shocks. It is particularly true that the padding on the heels allows us to walk or run without pain. *Various fat stores in the body are designed to do many different jobs besides supplying emergency energy. Fat controls the immune system, mood, behavior and fertility. Women's fat is placed on the hips and in the breasts while men's tends to concentrate around the waist. Both genders have a large portion of their fat stored under their skin. Scientists have figured out that in ancient times, women needed a low level continuous supply whereas men needed an energy supply that was large and could be drawn upon at short notice. To this day, belly fat is laid down and burns up to 3 times faster than fat in other areas. So, with these comments, one has to wonder what is ultimately behind the push to be scrawny. As the article says, if you have no fat, you'll be dead in 24 hrs unless you have a constant food supply. Good way to eliminate those who follow the scrawny routine. No one should be shamed/taunted into conforming to what others think they should look like, genetics and individual path plans make us unique, hence we are called individuals. BE an individual and tell the anti-fat people to 'fuck off! They are living proof that misery loves company. With the Changes that are coming and the reduction of Earth humans from over 6 billion to about 500,000, the non-fat ones will die quickest. Observations - Judgments The Light side has so ingrained the \"judge not\" ditty, via the horribly evil Christian religions, that it has poisoned valid observations, with fear to make them, by countless people. A judgment is a conclusion made by someone based on observations. They should not be made based on hearsay or physical attributes, both of which are petty. Using physical attributes, such as race, weight, sexual orientation, etc is flawed. Why do people, especially Americans, resort to taking someone's action, then add \"he/she's so fat/ugly/gay/etc\"? None of those descriptions add, in any way, to a VALID judgment but are just spiteful and reflect the conformist attitude of the spewer. Judgments should be made on actions - physical, verbal or written. Judgments also should be those which apply strictly to you and your Higher Selfs path. Valid judgments allow you to refine your Higher Selfs path. Once a judgment is made, you should then apply the Laws of the Universe, especially the second law - Allowance.

Their house is now wallpapered with photographs of her, many in the marriage trap poses (reminding him who is boss). Other photos are conspicuously placed to keep a symbolic eye on him. It reminds me of dictatorships where Hitler, Stalin, etc are glaring down at the masses to keep them in line. This man chooses to remain in this energy-draining situation. This is his choice. The second law says he must be allowed to follow his path, no matter how painful it is. Where my judgment of this unfortunate situation comes in hand is to apply my observation via the Laws. I do not allow myself to be put into a situation of having to deal with the female, nor will I do anything to enhance the quality of her situation. The laws state to remove yourself from any situation you do not approve, but allow the participants to proceed as they choose. Only a Final Incarnation or a VERY Advanced on will understand this correctly. Making valid judgments is a necessity for your growth and Higher Self advancement. Resisting to make them or guilt after making them are taints of the Light side which lives to be in a state of fear and to create guilt, which feeds the Dark. Your path is both enhanced and altered by your judgments. Don't hesitate to make and acknowledge them for what they are. Observations - Violence Last night I saw a beer commercial on TV where Cheech Marin was repeatedly slapped by these vicious bitches only because he said things (in a singles' bar) like, \"I lost my phone number, can I have yours?\". Instead of ignoring what he said, they, in ALL cases, became violent and slapped him. There is no call for that kind of behavior, yet one continually sees in film, TV and print that it's ok for a female to be violent against a male even though he hasn't touched her. Why is this violence encouraged? I'd like to see what would happen if she said a comment like Cheech said and a guy slapped her in the face. You know those cunts would raise a ruckus of violence to females, while all the while encouraging violence to males. NO ONE should be violent to anyone else unless in defense. It is unacceptable for women to be violent against men and then complain about violence against women. Victimizer (woman) becomes victim if she gets her instant karma. If any male is slapped by a female AND he didn't touch her first, he has the RIGHT to slap her back! And another thing, I keep hearing/seeing how men always should be apologizing to females even if they didn’t do anything. What is it with the damned cunts!?! Always manipulating and controlling (Plutonian) and what's worse is that most men buy into their crap. You should never apologize to anyone because of their gender. You only apologize for something you did, real not imagined. Observations - More Violence By Women Last night, I saw a beer commercial where 4 different women slap Cheech Marin for making harmless, non-sexual comments. It's a Miller Lite commercial and totally anti-male. I've noticed that so-called sitcoms are getting worse and worse in promoting female violence against males. This is part of the Orion program for female dominance and making males subservient.

It’s like a cancer, spreading and destroying. The men go along with it due to THEIR DNA programming. This is why such a fuss of'you hate women' is bullshit and pure victimhood. The female DNA structure recognizes when someone isn't following the Game and it blows the siren with the shrill 'you hate women' campaign. Then, if they can't convert you to the new ways, you will be isolated and marked with their curse. Of course this has nothing to do with 'hating women', it has to do with recognizing what's going on and trying to alert others to it. Why do men become so defensive with these miserable females throw the 'you hate women' line? Why don't you hear 'you hate men'? It’s all in the DNA command structure and the position of the spirit in its evolution. An Advanced incarnational spirit wouldn't stand for that and a Final Incarnation has much to say on that topic. When Washington dumps the 'violence against women' project and replaces it (won’t happen) with ’violence against people' project, then I'll take notice. Observations - Police State In one northeastern state, several kids have been thrown out of school for the so-called zero tolerance of violence bullshit. Four of the kids (grammar school) were tossed out because they were playing cops & robbers in the playground and using their hands as, gasp, guns! Another young grammar school kid was tossed out because he drew a picture that MAY be a gun and scribbled words that MAY be a threat even though it can't be read cause he's so young. These are just 2 of the incidents this week. This is all bullshit. It's police state programming with the consent of the majority of the people, just like in Germany in the 30's. The Light polarity AND the Dark polarity both want this to happen for different reasons. The Light is, as usual, in its holier-than-thou mode and believes if all guns are removed from sale, the criminals will give theirs up and it’ll be ’love & light’. BULLSHIT! The Dark loves the Light doing this and being most vocal to remove guns because they know once the guns are removed, then it’s all over for the U.S. and the Dark will take control with overt, rather than today's creeping, dictatorship, although 'creeping' has become running today because Dark knows how short time is for their plans to be fulfilled. What gets me is that people STILL say America is 'free'. How stupid can these people be??! I saw the old movie 'Judgment At Nuremberg'. The criminals judging the criminals. The US Prosecutor wailing about how many civilians the Germans killed. Oh, who bombed German cities? Who dropped the nukes on Japan? The Germans and Japanese started it, they say. OK, but why did you have to do the same and then try to act morally superior when you're just as guilty? American atrocities continue: bombing civilians in Serbia and in Iraq, for example. Where's the trial of American politicians and military for these crimes? You can't do that, they say. We’re Americans. Yes, and that's a major part of the problem. America is a Cancer country. Cancer is the sign who can dish it out but cannot take it. Only the Germans should have tried other Germans for what they did in their country, not foreign conquerors. What come around, goes around. A while back, there was a brief flurry of activity around Americans killing civilians in Korea during the Korean War. The former military responded that they were only carrying out orders. Really? That's what the Germans said and it didn't wash then, so why does it now? America, while it SHOULD be an icon, is anything but.

As the Handbook says, we must accept responsibility for our actions. Actions such as voting for people (Roosevelt, Lincoln, Wilson, Clinton, Bush, etc) who had nothing in mind except to strip away American freedoms for creeping dictatorship: Take away states rights, allow the destruction of Pearl Harbor, drag the US into European wars, etc. Well, America, this is what you wanted and what you got. Observations: Voting and The Game Election day is almost here and it's Kodos vs. Kang, as in The Simpsons episode of 2 aliens disguised as humans. Both major presidential candidates are part of the Game, fronts for the aliens and the Dark who currently control the Earth. Just as in The Simpsons episode, it won't matter which of the 2 major candidates gets elected, the Orion agenda will continue. The idea of 'wasting your vote' by voting for one of many third party candidates is a lie that the overwhelming majority of the country buys into. Even when the people, who found out the major 2 candidates are alien (in The Simpsons ) and say they'll vote for a third party, the aliens say 'you're throwing away your vote' and the people reluctantly agree with them! That's all part of the lie. A third party candidate is governor of Minnesota! While the major 2 candidates have some differences to what they promise, they will both obey those who control them from behind the scenes, and that's NEVER the people. Unfortunately, the majority of the people are minion and low level incarnations who always believe the government or just don't care as long as they're fed, watered and housed. Mid­ level incarnations are more concerned with conforming, in most cases, than in researching. Advanced level incarnates realize the government and politics are lies. Many refuse to vote at all, which is approved by the Game, because they won't threaten the 2-party system (2 sides of the same coin, in reality, and the coin interior is the Orion/Dark faction). They didn't figure on the rebellion in Minnesota. Imagine if it happened in a national election. Voting is NOT giving your power away. It is expressing your opinion in running the mechanics of the country. The Game counts on your vote for one of the major 2 or not voting at all. If you genuinely feel comfortable with either of the major party candidates, that's one thing. However, if you don't, examine 3rd party candidates and vote for one you really support. If you can find none who you support, maybe you will choose not to vote. Never vote for the lesser of 2 evils. That you view them as 2 evils (and they are) is enough for an Advanced incarnation to look to someone other than the 2 evils. A vote for the lesser evil is STILL a vote for evil!

If so how, by how much and are you eager to exit the Game or continue? THERE IS <NO> WRONG ANSWER!! You are where you are, and that is neither good nor bad. It's YOU! So, intellectually knowing the Game is one thing. You may enjoy playing the Game. You may want to continue playing the Game, regardless of the nature of the Game. WE <ALL> MUST PLAY THE GAME and WE ALL MUST LEAVE THE GAME. Once your Spirit/Higher Self-extension matures enough to be uncomfortable with the Game, it wants to know 'why'. It knows everything is not what it seems to be. This can take several incarnations or it can take few, but once you begin to spiral out, you rarely fall back UNLESS you desire to. Even if you fall back into the Game, you never quite play it the same, as your progression of Higher Self will reel you in even if it takes several incarnations. Your FINAL incarnation is the pilot of the ship. The other incarnations are ‘ crewmembers’ . You will have a nagging feeling in the back of your mind because you've been exposed to higher material. This material will help awaken you to who you really are. If you deny this and your feelings, you're only fooling yourself and delaying the inevitable. Fighting the changes (even on an individual level) will cause you pain and turmoil because the body is temporarily overpowering the real you. In other words, you cause your own suffering because you're fighting your true (Higher) self. When you flow with the changes, life is exciting and the stream of higher information is incredible because your spirit dictates to the physical, more than the other way around. Intellectually agreeing to observations about the Game is one thing, but if you keep fighting what you've learned in order to continue playing the Game, regardless of what you now know, will bring unwanted upsets into your life. Here are a few examples of the Game: Does the drive to make money overcome your desire to learn spiritually? Does society outweigh your decisions to change? Do others’ opinions take precedence over yours? Do you say, \"I can't say/do (whatever) because society doesn't approve\"? Do you enjoy hearing others break taboos (that don’t physically harm anyone), but you 'just couldn't do that'? Do you really enjoy the company of your same gender friends but can't complete the friendship (energy exchange) because \"I'm heterosexual\". Do you worry what others think about your hair/clothes/opinions? These are ALL some of the signs of the Game and the body's control of the spirit as well. Of course, one of my favorite peeves is the \"I can't because I'm heterosexual\". YOU'RE not heterosexual. That's your body speaking. Since we are all the same out of the body, THE SAME, your spirit is androgynous!!! Like attracts like in the spirit.

All gay or all lesbian circles are FAR more powerful than mixed gender because those in the gay/lesbian circles allow their full power to flow (even if the Higher Self hasn't matured enough to really appreciate it). You wills know you're more in touch with your Higher Self when you've advanced mentally to the bisexual stage. This stage is caught between the body and the spirit, but it IS progress, although it denies the incompatible nature of male and female physical (too much damage caused by the meddlers). This is really quite deep and intricate. These are just a couple more leaves from the tree, and I've given you others in the past. If you want to know more, there is more to know, far more. If you wish to continue the Game, enjoy it! Words are not enough in making the transition from 3rd density, body controlled existence to higher density, spirit controlled existence. Actions MUST proceed once you've come to conscious acceptance of the changes. If you refuse because (“what would my parents/friends/society think?”), then you bring your own problems to your door and only you can correct the error. If you say, \"I agree\" but continue to heatedly chase money on the stock market/seek to get married/want to have kids/need the opposite gender, etc, you haven't spiraled out far enough to make the break with the Game. As I said earlier, this may take several incarnations. That you're getting this information at all says you've advanced enough to at least begin spiraling out. DON'T PUT YOURSELF DOWN IF YOU STILL WANT TO PLAY THE GAME, IN ANY DEGREE. The other side of that is, don't put down those who are spiraling out and at the end of their individual journey of incarnations. One guy once told me, \"You're no better than I am, EXCEPT for everything you know\". Indeed, and then the Game caught him, he stopped growing at the rapid pace he was, got married and had a child. Play that Game!! However, this was his choice and I honor the choice. It gets them when I don't make a fuss over their choices, but they don't like the consequences of their choices either (that's the spirit making them uncomfortable for their decision). One other point, once you've started spiraling out, don't look back on others down your nose with comments like, \"he/she hasn’t progressed\" \"he/she is still at the level they were a year or 2 ago\". It doesn't matter. Don't be a snob and look down at them for where they are. Be concerned with where you are, not where they are.

If you don't want to have segments of the film revealed, read no further. This film is recommended. The most important segment is when their is a murder and the time machine inventor goes back in time to try and prevent it. While he does stop that incident, the person winds up killed anyway AT THE SAME TIME in another location, but still violently. NO ONE can intervene when a Higher Selfs decision/path is set. That incarnation WILL die when scheduled. So the inventor's quest is to find out why he can't prevent the person's death. A statement made in the film is wonderful: \"If you don't like the answer, you shouldn't have asked the question\". So true, so true. I can't tell you how many times I've been asked questions and the people aren't looking for knowledge but rather confirmation of their position. The time machine took him to 2037 when the end of the world occurs. Take off 30 years and you’ll be much closer to the time. When the inventor moves forward in time, he comes to Earth as a desert. THIS is what I have seen in 2200 and so have thousands of others who have independently travelled, as an assignment, to that year. I was surprised to see that. One other important clue - the Morlock leader (reptilian) who is reptilian controls the others who act very Sirian (wolfish). As he said, if it wasn't for his control, they would eat all the humans in a few months. Because the time traveller was SO stupid and tries to make everyone like him (no Law of Allowance for him), he winds up killing the Morlock leader (who was correct in what he said) and causes the Sirian types to run rampant (as they would do if not for the Orion Empire). He tells them that humans are their food and that's the way its been for 800,000 years. The traveller should have left it alone. If you can't see why, you still have FAR to go in your learning. Observation: Polarities and EndGame The EndGame scenarios require BOTH polarities to be as active as possible. On one hand, there's Dictator Bush in DC (sieg heil) as one of the visible Dark polarity icons surrounded by all his fascist/religiously rabid supporters and an easily deceived public. On the other hand is the Light polarity with the 'love not war' and power giveaway mentality. The Game NEEDS both polarities in EndGame since the conflict between them creates the energies that the lower astral feeds on (chaos). BOTH sides use fear as their main weapon - fear of nebulous terrorism, fear of war, fear of death (body ID), fear of different ideas, etc. This fear's use is intended to stimulate you to give away your power to either polarity and to allow them to manipulate you if you do so. If the fear methods had no effect, neither polarity could exist. This tells you the major reason why minion incarnations are encouraged - easily controlled humans with no simultaneously incarnating Higher Self \"interfering\". The politics is dirty Dark. Bush lies over and over again in his attempts to control the public and world opinion. For everything he says about his enemies, you can delete their names and insert his. He knows that most Americans will foolishly respond to patriotic themes and body ID fears, so keeping up unnecessary \"terrorist alerts\" is meant to keep the public off balance.

All Rights Reserved. 278"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"The Light polarity focuses of fears of death and dying but from a different perspective than Dark's. Dark wants to kill for power. Light wants to preserve all life as bullshit 'sacred'. Death fears appeal to those who are still body controlled and to minions, but minions will almost always choose the baser Dark path. Meanwhile Higher Self incarnates, although in both polarities, will tend to choose the Light polarity in the lower through mid-Advanced levels. Those in Very Advanced and higher levels know that Bush is a sack-of-shit traitor to the Constitution, and that the Lightside hand-wringers are are out of step with the thrust of the 1 Game but still serve it. The nature of EndGame is not peaceful co-existence, but rather to go out in a hail of activity, the Grand Climax. The Game certainly doesn’t want Light in control in this sector of the galaxy, but, at the same time, doesn't want Dark in full control either (yet) since that would end the major conflict here. Yes, Dark wins if the Alien Wild Card is played, but the fear of the Orion Empire would create a Thanksgiving feast on the lower J astral for quite a time. It could very well be that several Wild Cards will be played at the same time. The obvious card is the War Card. Meanwhile, that second moon in orbit of Earth visible from the southern hemisphere looms along with record ufo sightings all over - the Alien Card. Another is the Earth Changes Card. The Earth planetary spirit is pissed with the polarities and that has been made known in weather/geological patterns. The Asteroid-Hits-Earth Wild Card - they would never tell us if one was really going to hit Earth. Any government (all of them) based on lies/lying to their public cannot be trusted to tell the truth if it were not in their interest. There are also other Wild Cards in the deck as well. For those observers reading this, just keep watching and taking mental notes. Occasionally I hear someone say that those who are trying to stop the War Card from coming into play should stop and let the Game move into an even higher gear. The Game's pace will not be rushed or retarded. The Game is proceeding as it intends and the Lightsiders are necessary as they irritate the Dark players even more thus causing more dissention. As I said earlier, BOTH polarities are needed for EndGame. October 02 is particularly astrologically active in the negative sense. My advice for you is keep observing and making mental notes - look deeper than the surface events to see if you can spot polaric manipulations and Game thrusts. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Wild Cards, Events & Participation (Special Gold Edition Segment) During EndGame, there is a dramatic increase in Events and the playing of Wild Cards. How are YOU dealing with these? How will YOU deal with them as they are played? Last night (2/20/03), I was told that an \"Amber Alert\" was flashed on one area's television screens - ALL channels. However, other than listing the counties involved (I believe it was state-wide), the people told me that there was no sound or other caveat on the screen. They told me that they were \"so afraid\" and didn't know what to do. That is exactly what the government want you to say and the state of mind that they want you to be in. I said something to the effect of 'what a shame that nothing happened'. The response was 'yeah, we expected you to say something like that'. It turned out the 'alert' was 'unintentional'. Right, you know what I think of that statement!"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. This was a minor Event, true, but it served a purpose for those who rule. I heard that the talk radios all over the state were filled with panic talk on this incident. Remember that the government has been instilling fear into people for the last 1.5 yrs (9/11). Americans are basically prime for the picking. Then an oil tanker explodes near New York City today. One of the talk radio moderators said that he was so angry at being always in fear that he wants to \"bomb some country\". The government loves that kind of response too. Fear continues to rule. Expect more fear inducing incidents around the country. The Year from Hell continues. Examine your reactions to these types of Events. It is far easier to say what you would likely do when it is a textbook style lesson, such as what people in California thought when New York had its Event in 01. Their reactions are significantly different than those people in New York/New Jersey. My advice is to be as mentally prepared as you can be. Arm yourself with knowledge according to your stage of Advancement. Your Higher Self has already chosen the experiences you are to have. Trust in YOUR Higher Self. Those in Very Advanced levels will resist getting caught up in the moment by refusing to become one of the mob. That may turn out to be your experience OR it may be your experience to observe the mob. Both have valid points relative to your stage of Advancement. As for me, the Observer mode has been on for years now, but an Awakened Final Incarnation has a class of its own. The smallest number of Observers will be Final Incarnations. Low, Mid and through mid-Advanced levels will almost totally be manipulated by the government, Events and Wild Cards. Don't worry about them. That's their experiences. Remember the Universal Laws, especially the Law of Allowance. Let your Higher Self be your guide. If you fall to pieces, that's your experience. If you try to be a group leader/icon, that's your experience. If you commit suicide, that's your experience. If you go along with the mob, that's your experience. If you stand back and watch, that's your experience. These examples can go on and on, but you get the drift. You will be where YOUR Higher Self requires you to be no matter if it is in a city, small town or hidden in the mountains. Don't worry about the 'should have/could have' thoughts that will race through your mind. Most of that is body survival command structure. That structure will try to get you to lose any semblance of balance you may have. Then, when it is your time to depart this sector of the Game, your Higher Self will guarantee that you will die according to shim's pre-chosen decisions for this incarnation .Trust in your Higher Self Endgame & Simultaneous Incarnation Higher Selves This time period is unique from all others since Atlantis was destroyed. We have instant global communications, electronics both known and unknown (to the public) and the ability to experience other alien influences without leaving the planet. In former time periods, pre- U.S. civil war, few people went farther than 20 miles from home. Today you can hop a plane to the other side of the globe any day of the week. By flying to foreign countries you can experience the difference in cultures, standards, foods (to a certain extent), languages, ethics and much more. These are remnants of the alien races that engaged in genetic manipulation after the Orion Empire created genders here. You can discover that the ROOT MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 280"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"of foreign languages is similar to the alien languages of those who tampered on Earth. This also refers to written languages. These, of course, have changed/adapted as time progressed, but the alien flavor remains. For example, Chinese and Japanese look the same to untrained eyes, but they are very different. Yet the written versions bear similarities to their Rigelian origins. This was part of The Game, as I have stated previously, to experience this WIDE variety without leaving Earth. However before this time period, people could not really experience them as they can today. This PLUS the Endgame situation means, that ALL simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves have an active incarnation or two or three during this WHOLE period starting with the late i8oo's. I have seen one of mine in the World War II period. As for now, we simultaneous incarnates are here for Endgame. There ARE Final Incarnations, Dominant Incarnations, many Very Advanced incarnations and loads of other levels of incarnations. It is up to that individual Higher Self to decide which incarnation would be present, and what shim wants that incarnation to experience. There are many Final Incarnations out there who will never reveal themselves as they choose just to observe. That is their choice, although they are very interested in the Matrix 5 project. Like always, if you want to discover what incarnation you are, YOU must take that up with YOUR Higher Self. This time period is excellent for learning (computers, TV, huge libraries of books, etc) as has not been so since Atlantis. This is the climax of The Game. That the polarities are trying to undo the differences that were FAR more pronounced before this age, shows how they intend to make Earth like any other homogenous Orion Empire world. This will not happen. Experience whatever you feel pulled to. Don't let the polarities dictate what you should/shouldn't do. The word 'terrorist' has become a code word for anyone who doesn't tow the one world line. They use this word for violent people, but also for any other person/country/group that won't tow the line and people BELIEVE that shit! This is a central part of the Orion Empire plan - anyone who disagrees is a 'terrorist' or 'traitor' or 'unpatriotic'. These are ALL lies, but you must be Advanced enough to see through this propaganda. They don't want us to travel, hence all the hassles at airports. Fear is what they are trying to spread. ALL this is part of Endgame and we are here to observe and experience according to the needs of our own Higher Selves - the REAL you. Falun Gong and The Game The Falun Gong organization was cracked-down upon by the Chinese government, as we all have seen. The government said they were a threat. The group said they were only gathering to meditate. Why the fuss by the government? Falun Gong organized to meditate to change their lives and their country for the better. The Handbook for the New Paradigm warns people NOT to organize to do this. By organizing, they formed a visible structure with a leadership. This indeed IS a threat to the Game and the Game moved against them, as the Handbook warns it will. The Game will not tolerate any SERIOUS challenges to it. Robert Monroe warned about this as well. What the Handbook says to do is be individual or maybe 2 or 3 people, but definitely not an organization. The Falun Gong in China involves thousands.

The Chinese moved in when the Game was threatened by Falun Gong which means the Game's energies were being tampered with. They have protections against this. Falun Gong did not disappear from China, but the organization has been dealt with. That lesson must be applied to the rest of the world where ALL people are monitored, especially in the US, Canada and Western Europe. Conversations are monitored through the phone lines and much more. Read the 3 volumes of the Handbook to know how to improve yourself. Don't worry about tampering with the Game. Concern yourself with spiraling out of the Game and connecting to your Higher Self.

Observation: Body ID In Control This appeared on CNN's website (Apr 19,02): SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -- Clothing maker Abercrombie & Fitch said on Thursday it was pulling a new line of Asian-themed T-shirts after Asian-American groups complained they were a blatant example of racist stereotyping. The shirts, which retail for $25, hit the shelves this week and carry caricatures of slant-eyed Asians in conical hats along with such slogans as \"WONG BROTHERS LAUNDRY SERVICE:' TWO WONGS CAN MAKE IT WHITE\" and \"WOK-N-BOWL - CHINESE FOOD AND BOWLING.\" \"It is not and never has been our intention to offend anyone,\" Abercrombie spokesman Hampton Carney said. \"These graphic T-shirts were designed with the sole purpose of adding humor and levity to our fashion line. Since some customers have been offended by their content, we are pulling these shirts from our stores,\" he added. M A TRJX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Body ID has become central to most Earthers. WHY? Because the Game and the Orion Empire do NOT want you to know that you are NOT your body. If you believe (look at the word 'beLIEve' and see what is central to the word) you are your body and are here for one incarnation, then you will allow your body to rule you unless your spirit matures enough to get over it and know that shim is incarnated in ALL kinds of bodies and Earther races. Therefore, it really doesn't matter if you joke about one or another or ALL of the races/genders/etc. You are them all. If you can't laugh at yourself, you will NOT be able to spiral out. This carrying on about being 'offended' over the slightest thing makes an Awakened Final Incarnation just shake his head at the foolishness AND one other thing, you aren't ready for the Matrix 5 materials yet. If you are offended because someone makes a comment on race or gender, get over it. One example: I watched Politically Incorrect and the black panelists are all arrogant over the use of insult words used by non-blacks. They say 'you can't nigger (or anything else that they consider as insulting' to us, but yet at the next breath say 'cracker, honky, whitey, etc.' to white people INTENDING the same insult to whites as they refuse to accept for themselves from whites. Double standard - we can be racist but no one else can. When it should be, for those wallowing in the Game, if you don't want to be the brunt of those terms, don't use similar ones and if you use them, expect them to be used back to you. The Game basks in such injustices and encourages them. They breed resentment, fears and Dark emotions that feed the low astral beings and encourage more conflict. When I talk with other Very Advanced, I can refer to past incarnations as any race I have been and do it 282"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. with humor because I know who I am and am definitely NOT my physical. It's ALL about experience. Observation: Zigzag, Body ID & The Game \"Fear will keep them in line\" says the Dark AND the Light polarities. As you know, there is a drama happening, in the Washington, DC area, of a sniper randomly shooting the locals. The fear being generated in that area is a feast for the lower astrals and is conditioning those who live in that area. The latest test of control involves this \"safety tip\" from police (\"WHEN outside, move quickly and walk in a zigzag pattern\") to those who want to tempt fate and dare to move outside their homes <sigh> For those who have been regular Matrix 5 readers, you know that your Higher Self has chosen the manner and the time of each incarnation's death. As I wrote in the Time Machine 2001 segment, there is NO way to alter that once the incarnation has begun. Those who have died and will still yet die in this planned event are fulfilling their Higher Selves' plan. If your incarnation has a violent death and you, knowing that, were to hide in your home on that day, you would STILL die violently on the appointed time. A plane crashes into your house, a truck rams your house, a meteor levels your house and so on. This zigzag nonsense is something that those in control are using to gauge obedience under fear. The government has the ability to catch ANYONE that they WANT to. 'Want' is the key here, but if the government is involved...connect the dots. If you go to the Library on Monroe level 27, go to the Current Events sections and discover some of what is to be enacted in this EndGame scenario. If you are meant to know...you will know what these events are. While you can discover Game Wild Cards in the Library, which Wild Card(s) will be played is not available (yet) to us even in the Library. That’s part of the Game’s restrictions and, I have discovered, that is for the overall best. The people you may see zigzag moving in the DC area are all body ID'd people. Minion incarnations will be fierce zigzag movers. Higher Self incarnations below Very Advanced stages will do the zigzag trot too, but something will nag at the back of their mind in the Advanced stages. This will be an impulse from their Higher Self. These are valuable learning experiences for both Game participants and the much smaller section of Game observers. For myself, I'll be watching the news and hope they show video from the air of the zigzag trots and I'll laugh. Expect fear based conditioning to increase. 2003 is set up to be the year from hell. Stay tuned. Fear rules in the US. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Observation: Drums of Fear Do you get a load of the bullshit that the American and British governments have in play?! Tanks at Heathrow Airport in London and missile batteries pulled around Washington. Will there be a tank invasion of Heathrow? What country will be firing long range missiles at DC? This is ALL FOR SHOW and to raise the fear levels in people. Chicago shows their emergency services activated. Fear, Fear and more FEAR! The American government tells people to stock up with a 3 day supply of water and other items for \"terrorist attacks\". The only 'terrorists’ to strike have been the American government in the past 1.5 years. This government is using terror and fear to influence the population and control the attitudes of the public to cater to the whims of government. This 283"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

It's also been said on television that the duct tape/plastic is worthless. I agree. They want your power because without your power, they are powerless. They know it, but most people DON'T know it. Minions quake and shiver. This is why the majority of the planet is minion incarnated. Minion incarnates will eagerly give away their power because this is the order of things in the animal world carried over to minion-human event. Low and Mid level Higher Self incarnates will also give away their power. This is part of their experiences. You can see that there are relatively VERY few Very Advanced and Final Incarnations around. These are in the process of taking their power back. Mid-Advanced incarnates can be torn between giving power away and taking it back. A mid-Advanced level will believe that Iraq is the cause of problems. A Very Advanced level knows that Iraq is the symptom but not the cause. The cause is to blame, not the symptom, and, anyway, this is part of the Game. This is the Year From Hell. So far it is well justified, but it will get much worse. This is not the time to give away your power, but the time to take it back. EndGame is here. Depending on your level of Advancement, you will either give your power away, struggle to get it back or be an observer. Observers do not give their power away. Do what YOU must. Observations: Clinging to Body Identification and Victimhood This is appeared in tonight’s CNN-Europe’s site headline: 01 September 2001- \"Africa calls for slavery apology\" . \"African leaders have called on the U.S. and Europe to apologize for their part in colonial slavery but are divided on whether to insist on reparations.\" These guilt dispensers are trying to lay the blame for what happened in the 18th century and earlier on today's inhabitants of Europe and the US who had nothing to do with the situation, now that we're in the 21st century. The Arabs were BIG slave traders, and still engage in the practice in some areas, but they aren't mentioned. Maybe the victims/victimizers fear they'll 'come & get them'? So, why are these people engaging in this scam? A segment of American population says that much of America was built on the backs of slaves. True, but that was then and this was now. But the Japanese and the WWII European Jews got money, so WE want some too. There are many of those people still alive today. This is recent history, not history that ended shortly after the mid-igth. None of those people OR their children are alive today on BOTH sides of that problem - slaves & owners. The people alive today are only distantly related to them. One other, and more important, thing to think about is that we could have all been in bodies of slaves in those well-past times and we could have also been in bodies of slave owners too. It’s all experience, after all. These people, so body ID'd, are just looking for quick bucks. But, they say, the American government didn't keep promises made. The American government NEVER keeps promises it makes unless it is convenient. This has always been the case. Look at all those Native American treaties-of-convenience (of the 284"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. moment) that were broken when Washington felt like it. Same today with reptilian Bush breaking arms and other treaties made with Russia. The American government is one of the Darkest on the planet. Should you expect any less of them? So, these clowns want apologies for the distant past, well, then the Greeks will want apologies from Turkey for occupying their land and making Greeks into virtual slaves. The Spanish will want apologies from the Arabs for plopping themselves in Spain. Then there's those damned Huns making slaves all over parts of Europe. The Israelis are carrying on over some ancient crap all because of 'we believe we use to live here in the past'. Using that logic, the Native Americans can toss all Europeans out. Then that damned Roman Empire - the Italian government should be apologizing all over the place for everything that happened under their rule. These are just a FEW examples of dragging up OLD stuff and body ID/ victimhood. SO petty. SO unwilling to get on with life. You can't blame the descendants of long gone generations for stuff their ancestors did. It’s SO body clinging and goes against spiritual development. Let's see, maybe next the Southern US states should demand an apology and reparations for the Yankee burn and kill of civilians during the Civil War. The Dark will do ANYTHING to increase the division of people on Earth. I can’t imagine how it could be any more divided here! It's time for The End! Difficult Aspects of The Game; Slavery & Victimhood (Special Gold Edition Segment) This segment is written with the Very Advanced in mind only. The Game and many of its components have been written about extensively in Matrix 5. There are light, easy areas; heavy, dark areas and some extreme trying areas. Your Higher Self wants experiences in ALL areas. This is necessary to spiral out and handle above 5th density realms. One of those extreme, difficult areas (from an incarnational point of view) is slavery. Slavery has existed on Earth ever since the alien genetic scientists split the Ancient Earthers into two genders. First it was human slavery to alien masters. The aliens created the black race specifically as heavy, manual laborers, but not all slavery is manual in nature. After the aliens left or moved behind the scenes, slavery continued. Atlantis had slaves as did other cultures of that time. Slavery continued after the flood period and it was common all around the world. Slaves were black, white, yellow, red and brown (plus some others). Conquered countries became slave fountains for the conquerors. Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, Chinese, Japanese, Nubians etc all had slaves of one sort or another. There were manual labor slaves, menial labor slaves and educational/teaching/mental oriented slaves. Slavery is part of the Game experience. Some slaves were treated very well, many were not. Slavery still exists in some small parts of the world today, although it does not get publicity it did in the past. The ending of most slavery didn't get its start all that long ago, relatively speaking. It isn't that slavery is no longer a facet of the Game. It is that slavery is gaining a different connotation. The Orion and Sirian Empires certainly have slaves and they do consider Earthers as part of their property. If they succeed in their intent to return before the simultaneously incarnating depart, you will learn what being a slave means in the 21st century. It isn't pleasant when the race is alien and looks on you as livestock. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 285"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"In the US, the big brouhaha over slavery began in the early 19th century. This event was part of the Game. Slaves are not permitted to have slaves and, in preparation for the return of the Empire, the concept of Earthers having slaves must be done away with. There were well meaning people who were repulsed by the idea of slavery, blit that in itself would not bring about the end of it. (Remember about trying to change the rules) Slavery would have ended eventually in the US without the massive bloodshed of the Civil War, but then you wouldn't have had a fear feast for the lower astral allies of the Empire. You also wouldn't be taking a major step toward the One World concept without the Civil War. The traitor-to-his- oath, Lincoln, caved under the One World concept when he didn't allow the southern states to leave the Union by following constitutional procedure. Way back in the early i86o's, the One World push had already started in the US. Slavery is an experience. All Higher Selves know it. It is the incarnation that either delights or is repulsed by it, depending on the experience required. You will have been on both sides of that coin in several places in your incarnational experiences. Examples: Black slave in the southern US/slave owner in the Roman Empire...slave in England/slave owner in China. You must face up to these experiences. You will have full memories of ALL your experiences when your Final Incarnation summons back all of your Higher Selfs energy streams. You will also see them for what they really are - experience, part of the Game. You can own slaves in Dungeons & Dragons or similar games of fun. These are very minor examples of the Game itself. While ruling your best friend's character as a slave, this does not change the friendship you have outside of the D&D style game. Likewise in the Game - the Higher Selves know it is a much grander version of a D&D style game. All this whining about slavery is done by those incarnations stuck in low through low-Mid levels of progression. In the US, there are many blacks who cannot stop harping on the slavery issue. This is because it is used as a victimhood weapon and should be seen as such especially since none of them alive today have been slaves nor were their parents. Refer back to victimhood segments of Matrix 5. Another group who uses the slavery victimhood weapon is the Jews. They'll go back so far as the Egyptian period where they were not the slaves of the bible as they would like to think. Of course any time one tends to disagree with one of these former slave clinging groups, they don't hesitate to walk around the room carrying their cross. They claim to want to be accepted for themselves, but constantly use a victimhood tactic if they don't get their way. This is spiritual immaturity. This is THEIR problem and THEIR experiential loop to overcome. Those people in these types of groups (there are more than just these two examples given), who are of Very Advanced and higher stages, recognize this and have moved beyond the victimhood ploy that those who enjoy the loop play. The key to remember here is that this IS the Game and these ARE segments of the Game. Race based shit is SO 3rd density. One look at the cover of Matrix 5 and you can see what you really look like. Not only that you are all races/genders and both sides of all coins. The Learning Experience! When you entered the Game, you knew what was involved. You also knew the incarnations would create havoc of varying degrees until you achieved Very Advanced stages. Nevertheless, experience is the name of the Game!

Observation: Terrorism & the Game A minority group in one country decided that it doesn't want to be under the rule of their 'mother' county, so it engages in actions to disrupt the economy and the control of the ’mother' country. Small bands engage in violent acts, mostly under cover of darkness. Guerrilla attacks against regular military/government forces and against people (the majority) who want to remain part of the 'mother' country. Violence causes more violence. The rebels eventually succeed in ousting the 'mother' country forces with the assistance of foreigners. In today's climate, these minority forces would be called terrorists. Their country was formed on the basis of 'terrorism'. This country is known today as the United States. The Boston Tea Party is considered a 'terroristic attack' against Boston merchants to give one example. Separatists regularly terrorized loyalists as well as British troops. Yet those terroristic activities are held up as 'good' when taught in American schools. Remember, back then, they were ALL British citizens, By the victor, the history is written with their political slant and bias. As British citizens, violent acts against the crown were, obviously, against the law. Yet, what did the new American government do once organized? They made illegal for using the same tactic that put it into power. Examine and think carefully about the events. For a country founded on 'terrorist activities', there is something to hide when it forbids other similar activities and when it could not adhere to the law in the first place. Now, America, as the world's bully, is telling everyone else what they should or should not do and uses threats, both economic and military to attempt to keep others in line. It was the terroristic-founded US that started using the word 'terrorism' to refer to others who didn't tow the American political line. Like 'Old MacDonald's Farm', here a terrorist, there a terrorist, everywhere a terrorist - the American and, conveniently, the British governments are attempting to rule everyone else. Why? This is a major segment of the Game on Earth for this time. The British royals represent certain reptilian interests on Earth, as does the American government and especially the Bush family (at this time). Remember, the Orion Empire is planning to return, as I've discussed several times in earlier Matrix 5 materials. They LOVE using the word 'terrorist' because they've discovered it pushes buttons in most people that will invoke fear. They form foreign policies that will encourage the same type of people today that decided they wanted to be free of Britain back then, to take actions against the people who (supposedly) elected the government that makes this heavy handed policy. They are blaming the American people due to the illusion that the people, as a whole, want these actions. The recent push of the pro-Israel bill in Congress just reaffirms that. In this scenario, the American people would deserve to reap what they sow. Their government, by proxy for the people (and false polls) are encouraging 'terroristic' actions in America. The American people are also being manipulated by the Game to follow the illusions that their current, non-elected president spins for them. It was essential to the Game that Bush be made president and, if not elected, then appointed. This happened. These events are the Game in full motion. There is NOTHING you can do to stop these events.

As an Awakened Final Incarnation, I observe. I can (and do) point out the Game's facets but NOT for the purpose of changing/challenging it. I do this for education. With other levels of incarnations, participation in the Game's favor and against it (polarities) will continue until EndGame. The Game MUST run its course. If you try to halt it, you will fail, however the experiences you gain by either working for the Game's objectives or for those who seek to change the Game are invaluable to YOU and YOUR Path. The problem develops w'hen others try to make their Path YOUR Path. You WILL learn not to do that and you will learn it at YOUR pace and in YOUR time. The purpose of my pointing out Game operations is so you have the chance to learn from observing and to understand SOME of the mechanics/manipulations of the Game. Your 'salvation' lies in ultimately escaping from the Game. I've given you several things to consider in this message. EndGame is in motion. Observation: Why the American Government Cries 'Wolf Ever since the Event of Sept 11, 01, the American government has been issuing attack warnings on almost a regular basis. Yet, NOTHING has happened. Why does a government who lives for paranoid 'security' feel it necessary to do this? Why does a government who avoids any positive communications on aliens, spread such obvious Chicken Little 'the sky is falling' empty warnings? The Game is in play. The government fully knows what their part in the Game is. This facet of it (today) deals with desensitizing Americans. They know that if they keep harping on the 'threat of the moment' that people, not ever seeing evidence of it, will eventually stop paying attention to the cries of 'wolf. Why? This is because when the next Event happens (not the one the government plans to cause, such as 9/11), people will be caught SO off­ guard that it will be major banquet time for the Dark and the lowest astral entities who will gorge themselves on fear. More importantly, they also know that people who are wrapped in fear will do anything and obey any government directive to have what caused that fear removed. The Orion Empire and the Dark polarity are both involved in these theatrics. Since Earth is, in these times, minion incarnate and when you add Higher Selves in low levels, mid levels and lower-mid Advanced levels, fear will become the emotion of the time, as it is today, but will be SO paramount that it will rule their lives. This is what is planned and in operation. It is important that the Very Advanced and higher incarnates realize this and understand its implications. Depending on YOUR Path, you will make decisions necessary for you and YOUR experiences. My hope is that by presenting the Games tactics, you may be better equipped to make better decisions.

Observations: Osama Bin Laden Osama has been busy in the past few years and America has been hand wringing over him. Why hasn't something been done about the situations he's responsible for? It’s NOT Osama who people should be focusing on despite that's where the government wants you to look (an old magicians trick). They describe Osama as filthy rich. Ok, does he carry all of his money around with him? No, of course not. SO, where IS the money he's using to fund what he (in public) is in charge of? It’s probably in several banks. WHY hasn’t any government gone after the banks where the money is? Because they are off limits and controlled by the planetary/alien rulers. WHY hasn't any govenment gone after the countries where these banks are located. Obviously if you cut off his funds, he (or anyone else like that) is just another voice of discontent. WHY does Osama continue to get funds and weaponry? Banks and countries where these banks are located AND the countries who sell him weaponry. WHY were 5 (so far according to the news) Arabs trained as pilots for these huge planes that they piloted to crash? You just can't be a foreigner and walk up to these schools and waltz on it. You have to have financial backing (banks) and foreign government backing. This foreign government would NOT be at odds with the US (Libya, Iraq, Iran, N. Korea, etc). It would have to be a country who, on the surface, seems friendly to America. To wrap up - why doesn't the government deal with these criminal banks and their host countries and cut off the life blood of these terrorist organizations? These are some of the hard questions they DON'T want you to ask. But, then it means the government must also be involved. BINGO! Now you have one feather in the bird of why they want so many minions/low through mid levels around. There is more, but I’ve given you a lot to go on here. Observation: Semi-Global Mantra- “Leader of the Free World” The American president is the 'leader' of the \"free world\". Really? Was there an election held (that no one participated in) that bestowed this title? Why is the American president deserving of this title? Definitely not, because America is not a free country. It is no freer than others and less free than some. Yes, there is the mythological belief in American freedoms, but this just is not true today or ever. I could go into a lengthy litany of American duplicity and lies, but here’s a few: *Ask the Native Americans about American honor and freedom in regard to American treaties and genocide. *Ask slaves back in the Civil War and before about ’all men are created equal' and American blacks after the Civil War about how their newly awarded ’freedoms’ made them equals to European Americans (get in the BACK of the bus). *Ask the Irish in the 1800's when signs were up 'Irish not welcome’ or ’not hired*. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 289"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"*Research the Manifest Destiny (might makes right) declaration from the Supreme Court. *Ask gays why they have to struggle to get basic benefits that hets think are unique to their orientation. These few examples plus LOTS more show that there is nothing more than bullying by Americans to the rest of the world when it suits their purposes. If 'all men are created equal', these would be moot topics. In America, they say you have the 'right to pursue happiness'. However what they don't say is, yes you can 'pursue' it, you just are not likely to gain it. Communist countries are 'terrible' they said and still say. Why? They aren't 'free'. Hmmm, Americans, except in select cases, neither are you, so what's up? These other countries do not, for the most part, have the illusions of freedom that Americans are deluded by. Other countries will tell their people what they can and can't do - outright. America is deceptive about it coating the government's edicts with the flag. AS LONG AS AMERICANS BELIEVE THEY’RE FREE THEY WILL NEVER AWAKEN TO WHAT IS TRUE. This IS a major part of the Game (North American version). American isn't a bastion of freedoms, it's an icon of illusions. The government FEARS people waking up to this. Why does America bully other nations? Because 'might makes right'. America is a Cancer ruled country which is big on telling others what THEY should be doing, but don't they DARE point fingers at America's many faults. Do as I say, not as I do. For Very Advanced and Final Incarnations, waking up to the Game and MANY of its facets are required to spiral out of the Game. In these very late stages, FIGHTING the Game is not what we do. The Game MUST proceed at its pace and schedule. You've won when you wake up to it and refuse to play it any longer or any more than necessary to accomplish your incarnational goals. At the same time, we allow those who want to play the Game to continue to do so (Law of Allowance). If having the illusions removed from you is more than you can bear, then you are not ready for Matrix 5 materials nor are you yet Very Advanced. That's ok. You are where you are supposed to be, but that is NOT where we are. Lots to think about, as usual. Observations: Winged Reptilian Emblem & American Ditty In a current episode (Apr 11) of Farscape (Sci-Fi channel), there is a scene in the Peacekeepers' command carrier where a huge, wall mounted emblem is displayed of a winged (royal) reptilian. This is close to the Orion Empire's queen's elite sector of the Orion military. It does exist. Also interesting in Farscape is that they refer to the police state military as 'Peacekeepers' which is the same title used for Earth's occupation forces around the globe. Think about this and the above comment and draw conclusions. The power give-away ditty on US money (and appears elsewhere), \"In god we trust\", encourages you to conform to trusting the alien master(s) since the 'god' they refer to is the deity of the bible which is alien. The motto of Very Advanced and Final Incarnations, in this matter, is \"In NO god do we trust\". Take back your power! I've just read how one Lightsider group, after praying (can you believe it) to the nebulous 'god' of theirs named 'Isness', is encouraging their followers to rise up against the Game. That's like saying, 'the Dark side needs more energy'.

MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. The Game and Dinotopia In the TV Guide (May 11-17, 2002), open the cover and see a 2 page, color ad for Dinotopia \"A Secret World is about to be revealed\", says the ad. This is a 3 part mini-series by Disney. Disney is HEAVILY involved in the Game. This series begins on Sunday May 12 with a 2 hour first part. A quote from TV Guide (p.106): \"Wonderful World of Disney mounts a lavish three-part fantasy about dinosaurs of many varieties who peacefully coexist with humans in a utopian society.\" The cover of TV Guide (home mailed issue) features the mini-series, although the store version has Star Wars II on the cover. Coincidence? Think about it. This is an effort by the planetary rulers, who KNOW about the intended return of the Orion Empire, to put a spin on the reptilians. They say this mini-series is a fantasy. That IS correct. The genuine reptilians do not act like they portray them in this upcoming show. They'd like you to beLIEve that the reptilians are your friend. Yes, they'll help themselves TO you. I will be interested in watching this 3-parter just to see what they are selling. The Empire IS on its way back. Star Wars is more like it though. Don't be disarmed by, what seems like, a cutsie show. A major US insurance company has a new series of ads being shown on US markets. I've seen 2 versions of this ad so far. One has a lizard featured in the ad and the other has a human. In both ads, the phrase \"cold blooded, reptilian balance\" is needed for us \"warm blooded\" is used. This is a brazen move by the reptilians on Earth. Add this to Dinotopia, Figment (Disney character) and countless other prominent lizards portrayed as cutsie. The real thing is anything BUT cute. This is the first time that I've seen them overtly state the 'superiority' of reptilians to humans in a factual, non-science fiction way. The reptilians are NOT balanced. If you have read all the Matrix 5 materials, you know what Balance is. The reptilians thrive on the Dark polarity. Look at the Orion Empire and the reptilians active on Earth. It's all about power and control, but NEVER 'balance'. Keep an eye out for this type of reptilian promotion. The Empire is moving to return and their agents on Earth are trying to get us use to it, all in the illusion of’cute'. The Game and Dinotopia: Revisited Dinotopia, Disney's attempt to portray the reptilians as kindly, love & light beings, was not all that interesting to me. However, there were a couple of things I took note of, one of which was the book entitled, \"The Care and Teaching of Humans\". Another was, at the end of the mini-series, Disney announces that Dinotopia will return in the fall as a series and showed a reptilian hand, palm outward touching a human hand also palm outward. Remember to consider the opposites. What they are trying to let you know, according to the Game, is presented as the opposite of what is. The book is more like the old Twilight Zone 291"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. \"To Serve Man\" cookbook and a \"Handbook for the Care and Feeding of Humans as Livestock\". The two species' palms touching is pure fabrication. You don't make friends with your food and the reptilians consider Earther humans to be a far lower species and, therefore insignificant. This is also a deception. Abundant commercials for next week's Disney film of loveable, lizards were shown during the 3-parter. The drastic increase in love the lizzies is part of the return to the Orion Empire and the return of the queen that is, for the most part, considered inevitable. This is a major flow in the Game and a darling of 3rd density Dark polarity. Another reason for the return of the Empire is the core nature of the game itself - Earther Higher Self incarnates, the ultimate frustrating point of the sequential incarnates. Nevertheless, it is a central part of the Game, which is drawing to a close the Earther Higher Self portion as those Higher Selves are preparing to exit the Game and move on. The Game will continue without these major pieces as the sequential incarnates will continue to SLOWLY plod along on their Path without the 'distraction' of Earther Higher Selves. Symbols: The Dragon and the Phoenix When I was in China for 10 days, I was shown many references to the dragon and the phoenix being representations of the Emperor and the Emperess respectively. When touring the Ming Emperors' tombs outside Beijing, I saw the Emperor’s dragon throne and the Emperess' phoenix throne. Both symbols significantly present in their tombs as well as in the Forbidden City. When I had my picture taken wearing imperial robes, the dragon was significant on the embroidered design. The dragon is a direct link to the Orion Empire in all Earther cultures. It is not as well known that the phoenix is also a symbol of the Orion Empire especially a significant segment of the Orion queen's influence. I found one Ming era teapot interesting. It depicts the phoenix subduing the dragon. This DID happen in ancient Orion history when the females, in a violent coup, became the dominants in Orion reptilian society. I flew a China Air flight from Beijing to Shanghai. The symbol of China Air is the phoenix. It is on the aircraft itself as well as the ticket stub I saved. Notice they did not choose the general symbol for the Orion Empire, the dragon, but rather the. Orion queen's symbol, the phoenix. Rigel is allied with the Orion Empire and Rigel was the prime designer of the Asian peoples. When I studied with the Native American shamans for 12 years, the phoenix was revealed as connected to the Native American's star origins. This is not commonly known and it took me almost 6 years to receive that bit of information. The phoenix is a common symbol used by the queen's genetic scientists, along with the caduceus. The different symbols refer to different sections of the genetic command structures. The caduceus is the scientific segments while the phoenix is the political segment. The phoenix is central to the largest city in Arizona as well. Yet, I remember an Apache shaman teacher I had say that in the old days the city, now known as Phoenix, was considered so evil beneath the ground (underground base) that shamans were buried face down to attempt to keep the evil away. Much still goes on beneath Arizona’s surface today. The phoenix is a prime symbol of the rulers of the world, the Illuminati and so on. Their connection, while originally to the Orion queen, was switched to the rebel queen who has been in control of Earth for several millennia now. The 'true' phoenix is returning, as I've MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 292"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Bringing these things to your attention may alert you to look deeper and with a more critical eye to symbols and Game participation. It can greatly assist you when you desire to spiral out and to watch, when you are Advanced enough, how the Game's major pieces may move. When the US began as an individual country, the phoenix was pushed for as the symbol of the new country. Do your own research if you wish to know more on that. Dragons and the phoenix - all symbols of the Orion Empire. Watch and learn. Observation: McCarthyism returns as McBushyism There was an article on Rense.com entitled ‘Bush And Friends Try To Quash Criticism Of 'War On Terror' On The Front. It's rare for me to mention something from Rense because it must have relevance to Matrix 5. It shows a major shift in the Game in the U.S. because of overt suppression of illusionary freedoms. Note one person below says Americans have freedom of speech but there are consequences to that freedom. With that perspective the WHOLE world has 'freedom of speech' because anyone anywhere can say anything ONCE. THAT is NOT 'freedom of speech'. Just as McCarthy, in the early 1950's, used fear and guilt wrapped up in the flag, this horror has returned, now 50 years later, with McBushyism. This manipulation by the Game is part of the return of the Orion Empire. As an overt member of the Empire, Earth will become female dominant and fascist (just like Mintaka). With the UN-American McBushyisms, they use guilt, fear and more to attempt to force conformity. These are the real Anti-Americans. Those who buck that system are Higher Self incarnates (minion incarnates would NEVER buck the system as long as they are fed/watered) who want the experience of clashing with the Game. They have a lot of courage, but then, TRUE courage is an Advanced Higher Self trait. It's the courage to be an individual. As for my Path, it is not to confront the Game, however I will expose segments of it so you know what is happening and how manipulation attempts are working. You can only make your decisions based on what you know. Once you know, whether you believe or not, the decisions made by you will be based on the Path YOUR Higher Self has chosen. Do what YOU feel you must. Try to remember the Universal Laws and experience what you will. Observation: 9/11 Media Circus The destruction of the World Trade Center in NYC, the attacks in Washington and other connected events would indicate the War Wild Card is in play. With all those thousands of deaths, you're not going to see the Americans sit back and let that pass. This will be viewed as infinitely worse than Pearl Harbor. So, now we finally have action. The lesser level incarnates will be wailing over the physical deaths and planning 'revenge'. The Very Advanced should now be perked up to watch how these events will unfold as the crank of events in 3rd density Earth takes a major turn. Now is the time to observe and there's PLENTY to watch. Yesterday, the dirge of wailing over the old event of one year ago was blasting through the media. Radio and television droned on over 'oh, poor us'. I turned on BBC America's 6pm news, hoping for some real news. No way. They had this sad faced woman (who looked ready to lose her composure) doing nothing for 25 minutes but last year's event. Of course the same was true for American national news. Not only that, but I notice that when I flipped from BBC or NBC to a non-news channel that the mood lightened. It was much more M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 293"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"rewarding watching reruns of The Beverly Hillbillies on TV Land than the self-pitying news. There was a constant subliminal, electronic feed of sorrow coming from the new channels. I was able to physically feel this emotional charge when changing channels back to news. From BBC (heavy) to TV Land (light) to NBC (heavy) to Sci-Fi (light). Every time I went back to the news, a heavy wave of negative vibration shot out of the set. The Game loves to pull this shit when there is something else going on that they don't want you to pay attention to. From my point of view, the new \"moon\" that took up residence around Earth should have been the lead story (refer to the previous segment on this site for that story). Well, they are attempting to hide this real event from the general public. Instead they are trying to whip up hatred against enemies, real and/or mostly engineered/imagined. They want the war on Iraq. They will do anything they can to ensure there will be a major war with Iraq. If you are playing in the Game, you will do your part to help this war - flag wave/patriotic song ditties, etc. If you are in the observer mode, you will notice (depending on your level of Advancement) how the Game is taking the Game players for a ride and manipulating them to do its will. If they aren't getting the support they demand, they'll cause more serious mischief here. In the office where I work, only one person was overtly caught up in that patriotic crap. She was the one who told everyone to wear 'red/white & blue' for Sept 11. Instead, only she came in wearing that costume. I wore a purple shirt. During the day, a several co-workers complained to me about all this whining that the propaganda mills generate to control the population. Today's daily newspaper wails, \"America Weeps\". It should say \"Some Americans, In Full Body ID, Cry Like Babies\". ONLY the body ID'd person and the Game player will fall for all this 9/11 melodrama, especially since the origins for 9/11 are not where they want you to believe they are. The news yesterday also said that they will be placing an \"eternal flame\" on the site. THAT is Illuminating trade marking, as with Diana and JFK. Those who believe the official lines for the old event are in the fog of deception. Lots of experiences and observations here. Try to look deeper at these events passing through. Observations: Setting Up For Act III of the Event Act II of the Event is progressing to war. Act III will be the consequences of Act II. These people have proven they will meet fire with fire, but the Event must progress on. What will be interesting is if aliens show up as that the Alien Wild Card would trump the War Wild Card.

Observation: Wild Card - World War III From watching/reading the news (remember that 'news' does not necessarily mean 'truth'), it seems that American dictator Bush is dragging the world into what is shaping up as World War III. World War III is one of the several wild cards the Game has to play during the final stages of EndGame. This is the card, many believe, will be the card. Don't count on it, however it IS a Wild Card and that has several possibilities to it. Problem/solution/reaction is how the Game and the polarities try and steer the directions that they want people to take. Bush uses the artificially created group of \"terrorists\" as the problem.

Pearl Harbor was allowed Lo happen by FDR to drag America into WWII. Yes, it could have been prevented. I noticed on BBC America World News tonight that the European polls say 'no war without United Nations direction'. Now THAT is significant for where the Game & polarities want Earth to go. These Europeans are no longer looking to their national governments for solutions, but the intended world government. This is what the polarities want people to do. The Game's direction is a One World Government. All this bullshit about 'terrorists' is just to use fear to get everyone to give away their power. If this WWIII Wild Card does play, you will have to decide what YOU will do. Will you play the Game by waving flags, cursing engineered enemies, demanding everyone be rabid against these people, etc? If you do, that's totally your lessons to learn in your current incarnation. What I will do is to stay within the Balance path and be a neutral. I will not flag wave, rabidly curse an \"enemy\" or anything else along those lines. I will not support anyone on either side. No yellow, green, chartreuse, or magenta ribbons either as these all indicate one's support of the positions they represent. I will observe, make notes and watch the Game in full action from the sidelines. I am not urging anyone else to do what I'm doing. I'm urging you to do what you feel you must. I would suggest you don't mindlessly react. Geez, if you're reading the Matrix 5 materials, you should be beyond that! Think before you act. DON’T react. Expect events to pick up and move rapidly. Meanwhile, observe and learn while you still can. Observations: \"The Need for a Gun\" as shown on Stargate SG-i, First Wave, etc. While watching such TV shows as Farscape, Stargate SG-i, First Wave, etc, I see the constant \"need for having a gun in hand\" by the lead characters. In Farscape, Crichton nearly panics if his gun is taken away. In First Wave, Foster feels impotent without a gun. In Stargate SG-i, Colonel O'Neill whines and near panics if an alien group tells him not to bring a gun to their planet. What is all this need for a gun? Each of these characters is dead on mid-level which is dead common in 3rd density Earth. They have no spiritual understanding and believe the body is the center to their existence. They don’t believe they have any power without that gun. Those who are firmly established in the Advanced levels don't require a gun. These Advanced people have (to various degrees) increasing confidence that their physical is not the omega of all and are coming to an increase of Higher Self control over the physical (which is at the height in 3rd density in shim's Final Incarnation). Something else, in Stargate SG-i, one of the most 'advanced' alien groups (Asgaard), chooses mid-level/zero spirituality Colonel O'Neill as the one they will deal with (contactee). O'Neill is permanently attached to his gun and is a nationalist. Here again we have their so-called 'advanced' aliens picking the worst one they can to be their go-between with Earthers. Did they pick Daniel Jackson, who has at least some Advanced (lower) traits and a terrific background in Earth's myths? No, he might ask the 'wrong' questions and is not as easily manipulated. Then there was this one episode where another alien group says if they deal with Earthers, they require the whole planet to know of their existence and what is involved. (Power/control groups shiver at this type of declaration).

Also, if these Asgaard are so 'noble' why do they allow themselves, to have the planetary populations they 'control', worship them as deities? These are all excellent questions, but, of course, the show's writers have to make this type of alien 'evil', when they are not really. However, this is body centered Earthers I'm talking about here. It's a different thing if you're in a war zone to have a gun handy, but to be so attached to guns that you can’t function efficiently without it on your person (Crichton, Foster, O'Neill, etc), then you can see where the person is (and isn't) in their progression. Farscape Season One #6 The Sci-Fi channel is releasing their excellent series on video and DVD. Tonight I received DVD#6 which has 2 episodes from the first season. I am recommending you either rent or buy this. If you can’t find it locally, you can get it at a reduced price at www.buy.com. Here's why: I've written that you can see what the Sirians look like (not exact but close) in the first of the two episodes - \"Till The Blood Runs Clear\". If you want a pretty good idea of these wolfish allies of the Orion Empire and how they act, this is the best depiction I've seen yet. The real Sirians are even MORE vicious, however. The second episode in #6 is \"Rhapsody In Blue\". John Crichton, the central figure, is an Earther who finds himself in a part of our galaxy where there are NO humans. Crichton is as mid-level spiritually as you can get. Zero in the Advanced level. In this episode, he is dealing with an encounter with Delvians (blue, plant beings with advanced mental capabilities). They do well in making him believe what they want. His Higher Self allows this for the experience. BUT when he's told he's different/weird (almost every first season episode), it's his vibration, even in the mid-level, that eminates since he’s having simultaneous incarnations on Earth dispite one incarnation in another part of the galaxy. He's told that he can help Zhaan regain what she needs from within. Zhaan tells him how he can be seriously damaged for wanting to engage in this ritual. This is when Crichton's Higher Self kicks in overriding the incarnation. Crichton gives Zhaan some advice that is quite advanced (for a mid-level) and that a mid-level just wouldn't have. When the event is over, Crichton complains because he can't remember what happened. That’s because it was an event between a simultaneously incarnating Higher Self and a sequential Higher Self. Crichton's Higher Self has stored the info, but it isn't necessary for shim's incarnation to remember at this time. You will have to get the video/dvd and see what YOU can observe. I found this MOST interesting and urge any who want to test their perceptions to view. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Farscape & Stargate SG-i, 2/7/03 I was surprised to find a few interesting observations on last night's (Feb 7,03) Sci-Fi Channel programs Farscape and Stargate SG-i. In Farscape, a Scarran female leader was depicted. When she came on screen, I was surprised to see how what she was wearing was very similar to what Orion reptilian female royals sometimes wear, especially the headpiece she had on. The Scarran female was also referred to as a member of the ruling class. Later in the same program, a Scarran dreadnaught was hunting the central character's ship, Moya. The Scarran ship was amazingly similar to the ship that was hiding within the Hale- Bopp comet's tail when it passed through this system. When Hale-Bopp was visible here, I went out of body to see if there was anything hiding within the tail. There was a huge, black ship that looked similar to a 4 bladed fan. The central core was round with one 'blade' 296"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"extending, on a 45 degree angle, from each quarter. The windows on the blades were different than the Scarran ship, though, which showed red windows. The Hale-Bopp ship had standard light glowing from their windows. Needless to say, I was very surprised to see this on tv. Following this episode, Stargate SG-i featured one of the Gua'uld female system lords using a genetic altering machine to instantly change a person’s genetic structure. AGAIN, this is very similar to the types of machines that the alien genetic scientists used to alter Ancient Earthers into genders. Whoa...and it's on television too! A lot of interesting sightings are out there if you but observe. With these from last night added to my observational list, I know there will continue to be more. This is EndGame. I've also found it interesting that the White House dictator and his henchmen are using the term 'EndGame' as well these days. Keep your observational antenna raised! Farscape & Stargate SG-i, 2/14/03 The Sci-Fi channel’s 2 showcase programs, Farscape and Stargate SG-i, continue to educate in a fictional setting. The Earth planetary rulers once stated that they could tell the people exactly what is going on and they wouldn't believe it. Information continues to show up but you must be a sharp observer to catch it and sort through the fictional elements. Last night's episodes of these 2 series programs were loaded with jewels. The Farscape episode, A Constellation of Doubt, centered on an interview and commentary about the alien crew's visit to Earth. The type of aliens you see surrounding John Crichton in Farscape are not the policy makers with the exception of Rygel VI. Rygel excluded, these beings are the ones that the genuine policy makers would want to keep as far away from Earth as possible. The 'Peacekeepers' even have a death penalty for their race if they become 'contaminated' by alien association. It is because most aliens are similar to this crew that the quarantine of Earth exists, as discussed elsewhere in Matrix 5. The average, friendly, sequential alien would be most interesting to talk with. There are many friendly type aliens out there. Semjase of Erra in the Pleiades was one. If you read Meier’s materials, she was chastised for accepting gifts from Earthers and not allowed to keep more than a stuffed bear. On the other hand, there are very hostile to Earthers out there as well, such as the Orion and Sirian Empires. No matter what planet the crew of Moya visit in the series, it's just like going to a different neighborhood. Yet, when they arrive on Earth, it's a whole different story. The aliens are fascinated by the Earther experience. Remember that these beings are sequential aliens used to conformity on a planetary scale, and here they find people who are very individual. The danger, as the sequential leaders perceive, is that actually experiencing the simultaneous existence to any extent will cause defections from simultaneous to sequential and a far faster rate. This is the Game and the sequential players are guarding their territory. It is interesting that the alien interviews, in this episode, broadcast on television brought out comments like: - \"if Earth is remembered at all, it'll be for the quality of it's manual labor.\" This from Rygel VI who, as a former empire leader knows about enslaving worlds. An Orion thought form. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit — The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

All Rights Reserved. - \"Earth must learn it won't always win.\" This from General D'Argo after assessing Earth's lack of technological sophistication compared to alien races. That is SO true. - Other comments: \"Earth is technologically inferior\" and \"current defenses could not stop invasion by aliens\". Remember the Alien Wild Card and the intended return of the Orion queen. Read between the lines and connect the dots! This episode was followed by Stargate SG-i's episode, Disclosure. In this the Chinese, British and French were finally told about the Stargate program due to an imminent invasion by aliens that require the Earth to unite. The Americans, in typical arrogant style tell the others that they, with Russian support, should keep the program under their control. An American senator wants to transfer the control to an NSA type organization away from the military. That's like jumping from the frying pan into the fire! The Chinese wisely say that they would have to inform their people about this program so people can get ready. The Chinese position is correct! Of course the Americans respond with that old ditty of people aren’t ready, yet they refuse to educate the people in order TO get ready! Control freaks who treat the population like infants. In the end the Grey alien \"supreme commander\" gives veiled orders to the governments that they want the military in control. Awed by the alien technology and appearance, they all give in. The main key here is the Alien Wild Card: invasion imminent. Another example of the Orion Empire's return for those who can spot the connections. Apart from this, I want to pass on some information to the reader about the real Stargate. I have spoken with Val on and off about the genuine Stargate for several years. Yes, it does exist. While the technology is used in the film, They Live, that film does not show what the gate itself looks like. It really does look very similar to the gate used in the Stargate film and series. It also operates with the watery-looking discharge on connecting. If you are interested in more on this subject, I suggest you get the Winter 2003 issue of The Montauk Pulse (vol 2, #17). Read the lead article The Pyramid of Sound bv Preston Nichols. The Montauk Pulse is published by Sky Books, PO Box 769, Westbury, NY 11590. Subscriptions are $i9/yr and are released quarterly. I was glad to see that someone had released data on the gate. In the Montauk Pulse article, reference is made to a group called the WingMakers. Exactly who they are is up in the air. It sounds like just another sequential alien tampering project. Keep that in mind when reading that article and DON'T get dazzled by the technology. You don't need a Stargate to travel to other worlds or densities. Those who cannot yet do, cling to technology, and, like a drug, the need for more and more technology is addictive and very competitive. Observations: V and V-The Final Battle The mid-8o's television movies, V and V-The Final Battle, are now both out on DVD. I just finished watching both of them and view them totally differently than when I saw them on TV. If you haven't seen these films, you might want to at least rent them. They had been released on VHS several years back. V depicts an alien invasion of Earth by reptilians. Much of V is based on the Orion Empire, real reptilian aliens and their agenda. In the short lived series that followed these two films, more reptilian culture was shown. These have not yet been released, but they have been rerun on the Sci-Fi channel. Unfortunately the V theme was written to deceive as well as enlighten Earther audiences. In reality, the outcome would M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 298"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. be quite different than the story portrays to lull Earthers into a deception of just how intelligent and capable the Orion Empire is. Some notable scenes in the film: *Humans taken as a food source - seemingly endless rows of humans encased in containers for the trip back to the home worlds. The humans are kept just barely alive in a form of stasis. While they do show the reptilians eating birds and small animals live, they indicate (but don't show) that they like ALL their food live. Earther audiences couldn't handle seeing reptilians eating humans. In V-The Final Battle they show a human-as-food processing plant. Humans are placed in containers here after being wrapped in a cocoon-like substance (alien preservative). The same idea was shown in Killer Klowns From Outer Space where humans are also shown being taken as food and encased in a cocoon or balloon. In this film, you must observe beneath the clown exterior and see what they are trying to tell you. There is a scene here where the 'clown' alien drains a body of its blood by sucking it through a straw. The Dark rulers of Earth have boasted they could tell Earthers exactly what is going on and no one would believe it. This is what you have in both of these films. Eating of humans has been a theme in several films over the years. ^Reptilians appear as humans. This is a reference to their shape shifting abilities. The human skin does not rip off, as shown in the 2 films. Also, not all reptilians shape shift. Another flaw here is they show the reptilians as physically similar to humans in matters of strength. This is absolutely NOT true. They are taller than humans, as I've said in earlier segments, and far stronger. Earthers in the 2 V films give the reptilians a good smack and down they fall. No way! You give the reptilians a physical punch and they'll just get pissed off and have their way with you. Physical confrontation with a reptilian is a sure way to be dispatched to the astral! Reptilians are also very rapid in movements. If they portrayed reptilians, in the V series, as they really are, it would have been a whole different story. They would destroy a whole city to do away with a terrorist cell of humans. They would do this without second thought. The reptilians are the oldest race in the galaxy with technology that is unparalleled. The human rebels would have been dealt with quickly and mercilessly. What you see in the film is pure Hollywood pandering to human illusions of physical superiority. Remember what I've said in Matrix 5, it’s the spiritual advancements Earther humans have and that's where we are the most advanced. Review Matrix 5 on these topics. ■^Impregnation of human by reptilian - Human teenage female whores around with reptilian hunk (appearing). Here you seen a human female in search of power. The reptilian slips her the forked tongue and gets her pregnant per her vamping. In trying to use her energy vampiric ability, she got WAY more than she bargained for. Talk about experiences and 'serves you right'. She has twins (no way did she appear to be carrying twins). One looks human, but the forked tongue comes out. That was good for a laugh from me. The second one was a reptilian with blue eyes. The second one dies early on, but the first starts shedding her skin and aging rapidly. The outward appearance is blond human (as that would happen with the dominant reptilian genes), but she spits poison on this other little girl. In the show, the little girl recovers. In reality, she'd have died almost instantly. Reptilian females DO spit poison. This girl becomes the 'star child' with impressive psychic ability. I don't know what the writers were smoking when they came up with that. They would like you to believe that mating with the aliens produces the ideal super race. That is alien propaganda popular with the 'dying race' theory. The reptilians LOVE sex for sex, not for romance. The reptilians are bisexual. They'll do it with anyone they choose. Read Matrix II for insights on this. Sci-fi is full of all aliens looking to human females as the galactic MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 299"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"ideal. This is just NOT true and another Earther fantasy. The same goes for breeding. Sci-fi would have you believe that any species can breed with any other. While this can happen with some, it cannot with most. Look at nature. How much inter-species mating do you see? Exactly! Reptilians with humans would be like cats with dogs. *The virus/bacteria gets them - The Orion and the Sirian Empires have conquered countless systems and planets. Their science is unmatched, including medical. They have been to Earth many times and never really left. Do you think, as in War of the Worlds, that common germs will be their undoing here? They created human life as we know it today. This end is just another Earther fantasy. Earth military (especially USA) has been trying to develop something to zap the aliens. The aliens know this. The aliens are unimpressed. What is even more unimpressive is how Earthers got the better of the aliens in Independence Day. That computer idea is so laughable. The aliens had to pee themselves from laughing so hard over the idea of it. At the end of V-The Final Battle, the aliens race off Earth and hide behind the Moon. IF, and it is a huge IF, the humans managed to annoy the reptilians to this extent, one of their Death Stars would blow up Earth and this system would have 2 asteroid belts - end of story. Reptilians do NOT think like Earther humans, although Earther humans never seem to tire of transferring their behavior patterns on alien races. I'll stop my observations here. There are many more to note, but better for you to observe them on your own. ALWAYS read between the lines or beneath the scenes in films like the ones listed here. Go beneath the obvious and discover a wealth of hidden gems. The more Advanced you are, the more you can unearth. M A TR IX V: The Gold Edition Ouest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Observations: First Wave Episode on the Sci-Fi Channel First Wave Messages The Sci-fi channel show, First Wave, is about the first wave of aliens on Earth getting ready for the major invasion called the Second Wave, which is about to happen. In the episode aired Aug 25, the main character, Cade Foster, was taken into a pocket dimension where he met an alien who tried to tell him how to defeat the Gua (reptilian invaders). It was a mixture of truth and misinformation (what else is new). The alien told Cade that in order to defeat the Gua, he had to 'forgive' them their nature of invading/enslaving planets. If he could do this, he would win. Cade, being a pure Mid level incarnate thinks the alien is talking about a military victory. The alien does nothing to discourage that. A better way to put the advice is not to 'forgive' them, since forgiveness is something requested for a transgression. The nature of the reptilians just IS and does not require 'forgiveness 1 , but rather understanding of what they are and the need for employing the Law of the Universe called Allowance. Allowance says you allow beings to be what they are. It's part of the Game that the reptilians invade/enslave/dine on people. How many times do we here \"it's the nature of the animal\". That applies to all creatures. Why do you need to allow these things to happen? Because we are immortal beings and the 3rd density is a temporary learning ground where the worst that can happen is the body you occupy is killed. This is part of the experience as well. Back to Cade Foster: He CAN win if he follows the Laws of the Universe as he will spiral out of the Game, thus defeating the aliens at their own level by denying them their victory. Remembering who you are and why you are here circumvents the Game and brings you above it. So they kill everyone you know in the physical. Are they dead or do they always 300"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. live? If you don't know that answer, you don't belong reading my materials. The alien told Cade that he would have to sacrifice friends (allow them to die to save others). Cade was told that many have died due to his inability to kill the alien leader occupying this woman's body. (Damned het males and their DNA commands - \"I can’t do that to a woman\" bullshit). Unfortunately, Cade's level is so body ID'd that he has sacrificed hundreds of people to selfishly cling to 2 people, 1 of whom the alien leader possesses the body. If you cling to the Game, you will want a military victory over the aliens WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE! My chiropractor is in that mode saying how he can 'take out' reptilians. Such a fool. He misses the point and is playing the Game. They WANT you to resist. They WANT you to try and deny them their prize. This will not bring you anything but very hard experiences, which, at certain levels, may be what your Higher Self wants. Finals and the VERY Advanced rise above the Game, step over the bodies and realize what is REALLY going on. It is NOT cold/hard (common complaint of the levels below Very Advanced), it is reality. Another Cade flaw shown, which is one I run into ALL the time, is that he wants to learn quickly, without much effort and with limited commitment. \"I just want the power and I want it now\" attitude is what he has, always running around with his gun and VERY insecure without it. Clinging to your gun will keep you hooked on 3rd density. The power isn't in a gun, it's within yourself. Remember and live the Laws of the Universe as they show the way to spiral out of the Game. Observations on the Concept of Home Ownership in America Own your home and be independent\" the advertisement says. This is just one, but a major one, of American illusions of freedom. If you really owned your home and property, you would not be required to pay property taxes nor have it randomly 'condemned' by local governments for their convenience. If you REALLY owned your own home and property AND you decided you wanted to pay taxes for certain services, the town you lived in would have a list of services and cost per home for participating in these services. You probably would want police, fire and trash services, but, if you had no kids, you wouldn't want school services. IF you really owned your home/property, they couldn't legally do anything to force you to pay. If you REALLY owned your home/property, the town couldn't condemn it just to build some structure (tunnel, mall, etc) they wanted. I've read of perfectly good homes being 'condemned' because the town wanted to bully something through. The illusion is 'I own my own property'. The reality is you are a cash cow for the many governments who ALL have their hands grabbing for your wallet/purse. This means you are just RENTING the property from the state. You may own your house, but you can’t really OWN the property. If they condemn your property, you could pay to move your home and you know what that must cost. Why do people allow governments to control them when it should be the other way around? That's one reason why they want so many minion incarnations, who just love to follow and obey. Home/property ownership in America is an illusion.

Observations on the Concept of Freedom of Speech in America As I've said several times in Matrix 5, America is based on illusions that just are not true. As long as the overwhelming majority of people believe these illusions, they will remain. The first illusion buster I did on this group site was the non-existent 'home ownership in America'. Now it's time for the next illusion buster 'freedom of speech in America'. We are constantly bombarded with the propaganda that we have freedom of speech in America. This is NOT true, but they want you to believe it is. In actuality, speech is becoming more and more restricted with the populace dancing to the polarity piper's tune. Look at those grand 4th of July spectacles. These are in place to bolster America's illusionary freedoms. They are a lie. I was talking to someone the other day who said he quit his job because people at work were using the word 'nigger'. He is not black. He told me he has a black friend and didn't like hearing it. Well, if we really have freedom of speech, you could say whatever you like. True freedom of speech means you are unrestricted in everyday verbiage. You don't have to like what you hear, but people have the right to express themselves, even if in poor taste. Even go back 150 years before today's technology. Was there freedom of speech here? Absolutely not. Slave owners were free to say whatever they liked, but resorted to violence when the contrary was said. Even after slavery, blacks were still called niggers, but they could not respond with a negative word about those who used that term. If there was TRUE freedom of speech, the blacks could have freely said what they wanted. Today the reverse is true. Blacks can say whatever they want but whites cannot. Both are valid examples, NOT of freedom of speech, but rather might makes right. Those in control using their position to force themselves on those who can't. The list of 'you can't say' is growing yearly, BUT the myth of freedom of speech is held on to even though it doesn't exist. Now laws are changed so that men cannot comment on women based on gender, BUT women still comment on men, based on gender. Even if both genders were forbidden to comment, how do those who believe in the illusion comment on freedom of speech. How many times have you been told and heard others say, \"You can't say that\". Use the masses to enforce conformative directives. This is also one reason why they want so many minion incarnations. Minions tend to obey as long as they are fed and watered. Now as to the why of what's going on. In the Second Edition of M5 ,1 discuss the sequentials in the Game. These same beings are trying to enforce THEIR desired roles in the Game on Earthers to retard their spiraling out. Refer to the Second Edition or the new supplemental materials for more on that. Since Earth is ruled by the Dark polarity and the aliens, they figure if they can impose their rigid conformities on Earth, they will win the Game. They cannot win the Game, but they are desperate due to the impending conclusion of Earth 3rd density. What I would encourage those of you, who feel so inclined, is to comment on the illusion busters so far given - home ownership and freedom of speech - to those of your friends who you think may appreciate it. It may assist them to spiral out of the Game. As always, if they don't see what you see, drop the subject and respect where they are in their progression. American 'freedoms' are a lie. The prisoner who is worst off is the one who believes he is free when he is not.

Observations: Freedom of Religion in America American riff-raff loves to parrot the phrase: \"We have freedom of religion in America\". This is PURE bullshit! What we do have is Christian dominance in America with a limited tolerance of jews and next to no tolerance of every other religion. IF we had freedom of religion in America, sessions of Congress would not always open with a prayer by some Christian minister or priest, with maybe an occasional non-offensive jewish rabbi. You would have openings by ALL religions practiced in this country. Yes, the Christians would have their stuff, as well as the jews, but so should everyone else including, but not limited to, muslims, wiccans, hindus, satanists, buddhists, druids, various pagan groups, etc. This won’t ever happen as there is no freedom of religion here. Can you imagine a satanist in Congress praying, \"deliver us from jesus\"? What a riot! But the damned Christians say 'deliver us from satan'. That is not religious tolerance. The riff-raff responds, 'but you can still join these religions'. Well, Christians are all over the radio and tv with their mythical nonsense, but put on a satanist or a wiccan program and the fuckin’ Christians will try and close it down. Actually, try doing anything the Christians don't like and they will show you just how far 'freedom of religion' goes. I remember in several areas where wiccan seminars were being held that the damned Christians tried everything they could to disrupt or block those meetings. Yet, these are the same riff-raff who will say 'America is the land of the free'. I know I'm not the only one who can see through that. What it comes down to is that people who are against freedoms in the Bill of Rights are actually anti-American. \"It has served us well, this myth of Christ\" said Pope Leo X and quoted in David Icke's Children of the Matrix (pi94). Yes, the myth of Christianity...of ALL religions has served the aliens and polarities VERY well. David says, on pg 195, \"By choosing to give yourself to a deity or 'god', you open your psyche to possession by the force that deity or 'god' represents, and deities like 'mary' and 'jesus' represent very different forces to those perceived by their 'believers'.\" This is VERY true, which is why I urge you to only go within and give yourself to your Higher Self, the true you. In this way you open yourself to receive messages from your Higher Self, the ONLY 'god' who counts for you. It doesn't matter that the religious believer thinks he/she is getting messages from \"jay-zus\". He's opened him/herself to get messages from the real entity behind the mythical jesus. How many times have we heard 'god told me to kill...', 'jesus is with us and he told me...' and similar phrases. Certain groups get after people who like the Confederate flag. They say 'the Klan uses it'. Yes, the Klan also uses the bible and jesus, but you don't hear those same groups saying, 'dump jesus/bible cause the Klan uses them extensively'. Why not? Does it hit too close to home for the Christians? These same groups will worship the master's 'jesus' instead of seeing through the illusion of it. If there was true freedom of religion, tolerance, REAL tolerance, would be the norm as would respect for other religions. Attempts at imposing your beliefs on others would also be not allowed. No missionaries. If someone wanted to know about religion x, they could investigate on their own. No one needs missionaries banging on the door to try and spread their poison in a misery-loves-company zeal with the intent of blocking your Higher Self. Freedom of religion stops when it involves harrassment of non-members. Freedom of religion in America? No way, never has been. The Christians have seen to that.

Following that shows the same block of homes this time with a hoard of American flags outside each one. The final frame is a reference to \"freedom\". What does this ministry of propaganda ad have to do with freedom? Absolutely nothing. Freedom is NOT conforming to political homogeny. Freedom would be to express your ideas DESPITE what the government wants, DESPITE what your neighbors want, DESPITE what anyone else wants. If the ad wanted to depict 'freedom', it would not have been a show of conformity but rather a show of varying opinions. However the US population is SO lied to about the word 'freedom' that it has taken on a life of its own, similar to the word 'love' meaning 'sex’ when actually they are vastly different. THIS IS THE GAME IN ACTION! The Game lives on word play and mutation of truth. What happens when the anti-war group expresses themselves contrary to the government's propaganda drive? The rabble descend on them for not conforming! If 'freedom' were a reality, those with contrary opinions would not be harassed but rather honored for their difference. Remember what I wrote earlier about America being under the sign of Cancer. Cancer is a sign of conformity and government rule. It is the shadow opposite of Capricorn and overt rule. The Cancer/Capricorn axis is not interested in 'freedom' unless it is 'freedom' to live within the narrow confines of their dictates. The Cancer/Capricorn axis is far more interested in empires (Great Britain, US, etc) and controls. Remove the veil from the warped wordings and see what is really happening. Freedom was visible when the group of firefighters in Florida refused to have the American flag on their truck as a political statement. If 'freedom' was valid in the US, people would have moved on. Instead you had a ruckus over NON- CONFORMITY. THAT is NOT 'freedom'. These same people who bitch at these firefighters are the same who parrot the propaganda illusion of \"American freedom\". Well, \"American freedom\" is NOT 'freedom'. To escape the Game, you must be able to see with your eyes unblinded by the sparkling rhetoric that the propaganda mills love to spew. If you have not yet reached observer status, then you will participate in these learning experiences. This is your path at this time. However the Matrix 5 materials are not written for participants in the Game. As an observer, you must distance yourself from participating in the flow of the Game. You must also look deeper at what is presented to you, by the propaganda mills, and remove the wrappings of belief to see the level of deception. What you will see will not be pretty. In observer status, you do not move against the Game, but you most definitely can point out the Game's mechanics to other interested observers. Share what you see. Remember, you don't escape by fighting the Game, but by removing yourself from it. Remember what the word 'observer' means - a non-participant in events, but someone who takes note and evaluates.

Observation: \"Four Steps Away From Sieg Heil\" On a popular, national radio talk show this morning, one of the 2 male hosts said, \"We're only 4 steps away from Sieg Heil (in the US)\". Observers can easily notice the rapid decline of America into a fascist state. The current occupant of the White House has become the Hitler of the 21st century, but it should come as no surprise since he said publicly (twice) how he wanted to be dictator. Even Hitler didn't say that in public. Congress has become mostly silent on the fascist take-over antics as has the Supreme Court. We've had our version of the Reichstag Fire on 9/11/01. The American public of today has chosen to be like the German public of the i93o’s. The scapegoat jews/gypsies/gays/etc of Germany's era are now Muslims or (ridiculously) any turban wearing person in America. Double standards (one for the US and one for everyone else) is an American priority. Remember when I told you America is a Cancer country and that's 'do as I say, not as I do'. The majority of the public DO support this fascism. This IS the Game in action. Go to this site and check out these cards dealing with the fascist movement of the US: http://yorick.infinitejest.org:8i/ You will see a number of excellent cards you can download. The only cards I don't support are the 3 'women screwed' cards. This-shows that even when you have such inspiration that the Orion program regarding women STILL pokes through in all but the Very Advanced levels where female superiority is a known myth. The best cards, in my opinion, are Loyalty Oaths (Ein Reich, ein Volk under jesus), Reichstag Fire (World trade Center Plaza), and American Public (Land of Mass Hypnosis). There are many more excellent ones. Minion incarnations are absolutely vital in a fascist system since minions make wonderful followers as long as they, like barnyard animals, are fed and watered. Higher Self incarnations can also trot along, for the experience, in all incarnations below Very Advanced. The Very Advanced and Final Incarnations are here to observe these shenanigans of manipulation and the Game in high gear (EndGame). It's interesting that George Washington had a 'dream' of the US being invaded. Well, since the US and the majority of its people have chosen the same route as Germany did in 1930, it should not be surprising that the outcome will be similar since this is an historic experiential loop. Americans have chosen this route and, as you know from reading the Matrix 5 materials, choices have consequences. Those who are being swept up in the manipulation of emotion s/so-called 'patriotism'/hate mongering, etc are fulfilling their roles in Game development, polaric manipulation and Higher Self experiences. Those who distance themselves from these types, observe and make comments contrary to the fascist line are learning by watching those who are foolishly led. Adolph (seig heil) Bush is trotting around the country wrapping himself in a flag and spewing emotionally charge speeches laced with lots of fear inducing phrases similar to Hitler's. 1930's Germans were swept up in 'seig heil' mass demonstrations. Americans in 2002 are now swept up in 'seig heil' sentiment and visions of false superiority. I have an incarnation in Germany during that period. That incarnation is a common mid-level. In this, my Final Incarnation, I have the opportunity to observe from a far different perspective than last century's German one. The Game wants you to hate. Remember we are in a Dark polarity controlled section of the galaxy. Dark rules and, in the long run, wins in 3rd density in this sector while the Game is in play. That the Earther simultaneous incarnate STILL overcomes and wins, despite the Game and its controls, says much for the Higher Selves who chose this path.

In this path, you immerse yourself in everything Game-connected, and raise yourself up and out of it. In this way you WIN the Game despite its controls, alien meddling and polaric demands. The war/superiority drum beat will grow louder. Examine YOUR role in this Event. Your position is important to your Higher Self and your progression. Observation: The Great Dictator (1940) & Game Symbol From Turner Classics Movies site: Warner Bros, publicity described this bold film as \"The Picture That Calls a Swastika a Swastika!\" Satire as a Weapon is wielded by Charlie Chaplin in The Great Dictator (1940), a spoof of Hitler and another daring film for its day (seen on TCM in the television premiere of a newly restored version). I watched this for the first time the other night. VERY well done and funny in several places. They said in an interview, with one of Hitler's inner circle, that Adolph watched it twice and thought it was funny especially in parts with Mussolini. With certain obvious differences (like instead of jews substitute muslims) and it really does parallel the US with von Bush (sieg heil). Even in the end, when Hitler takes Austria, he's standing on a platform with LIBERTY engraved on it. Fuckin' Bush is exactly the same and his henchmen mirror the Germans from the 30’s. History is repeating itself quite well. The movie was filmed before Hitler/Stalin invaded Poland. The 'threat' of Poland to Germany in 39 is the same as the 'threat' to the US from Iraq in 02 - non-existent. The Germans convinced the population that the Poles were going to attack and even stages a fake attack. The Americans are doing the same with Iraq. The Game LOVES to recycle events with minor changes in them. The cyclical nature of the Game, the infinity symbol (never ending and never going anywhere) is really the symbol for the Game. The only way to escape is to find the escape hatches located in various areas of the infinity symbol. This can only be done with full Higher Self guidance that comes only in your Awakened Final Incarnation. Before that incarnation, you are here for the experiences and maturing. Once matured to the level needed to move up to new densities, you reach Final Incarnational status. Matrix 5 is one, if not THE, best way to locate the escape hatches out of the Game. Americans are becoming more and more like the German population in the 30's, by 1938, the hands of heil were raised by almost everyone. I keep pointing out observations on this (more so in private to certain people) but it's SO obvious that only those fully in the Game will refuse to see it. However, the Matrix 5 materials are written for those looking for the escape hatches. The hell with those who want to play the Game from the Very Advanced and above levels. When you observe the shenanigans, see how you are in OTHER incarnations when you were in lower Advancement levels. Learn from watching and resist being swept up by the fervor that the American fascists (primarily Republicans/religious types) are propaganda milling for. It's going to get worse in America, MUCH worse as the fascists/traitors continue their draconian (Orion Empire) goose-stepping. I see otherwise sane people in my area that have been swept up in the spying, speech restricting fears that Washington is generating all in the name of \"Freedom\". My advice: Keep your observational levels high and be suspicious of anything coming from government as 'truth'. Do what YOU feel you must do, but question yourself/motives before getting involved.

Observation: \"Nose Thumbing\" at the World Colin Powell, one of George Bush's lackeys, stands at the press conference affronted by North Korea's decision to remove itself from a nuclear non-proliferation treaty. They are \"thumbing their nose at the world\", both he and his massah Bush(Harry Belafonte is correct), insist. How come you don't hear anyone in the world say the same about Bush withdrawing from several treaties because it doesn't suit him?! This is just another episode of the US, a Cancer country with a Cancer dictator, crying 'do as I say, not as I do'. I have previously given observations on this. You can see they continue and will continue to develop. Observers can see the obvious nature of the US's dictatorial imposition on the world. This is one outcome of alien, sequential thought on the world where the aliens have been preparing Earth to become just another of many sequentially inhabited planets. The nuclear treaty that they are talking about stems from an agreement by those who had the marbles not to share them with the rest of the world. This, of course, has not stopped other countries from gaining nuclear weaponry, such as Israel, India, Pakistan and South Africa. Nor did it cause the US to throw a hissy fit when they did get them. Now with overt dictator Adolph von Bush in the White House (remember what I said about Cancers in the paragraph above plus add the reptilian factor in with abundance), it should be the rest of the world who demands the US give up its nukes. Actually everyone should give up their nukes. Reptilians never give up power. You are seeing it in action here - a microcosm of the Orion Empire (US/Britain) trying to rule the galaxy (planet Earth). This is also in preparation for the intended return of the Orion Empire to Earth. MANY people are foolishly falling for dictator Bush's lies and manipulations. This is easier to have happen when the world is primarily stocked with minion incarnations. Low and Mid level incarnations are also fairly easy to get to tow the line. Remember, the bottom line, at this time, is the removal of the simultaneously incarnating and the replacement by a new type of being to run this planet for the Empire. The police state of the US also keeps turning the screws. This happens a little bit here, then a little bit there with the hope that no one will notice what is going on. The latest is the increased surveillance of American citizens going outside the country. It was reported on CNN and other news formats. The free (relatively speaking) ability to travel outside the country is decreasing. This will also happen within the country as the US fascist government continues its war with the Muslims and Arabs at the behest of Israel and its alien masters. Blind Obedience & Questions Some person or group of people in your government's houses of power decide that they don't like someone in another country. They decide that YOU, the people, should do something about their hatred. They decide that YOU should risk YOUR life to carry out their whims. They don't like leader or party of country XZY, but they also seem to go out of their way to tell you that it is not the people of country XZY, but the leadership that they don't like.

Switching from the ambiguous to some specifics: The current appointed president of the US is engaged in a personal vendetta against the elected president of Iraq for personal matters and due to orders by those in true power on Earth. Both leaders say that the people of the other country are not who they have problems with. Well, in that case, the people of both countries should sit it out and those leaders with the problem should meet in a stadium and fight it out in a ring with no rules other than it is just them who do fight. If people involved were Advanced enough (Very Advanced and higher), they would ask 'why should I fight with someone who has done nothing to me'? The Law of Allowance would say it is ok for those who want to fight to go ahead and fight, but leave those, who don't want to, out of it. Very Advanced and higher do not fight wars where they have no reason to fight. Afghanistan is another such surrogate war. Bush and cronies concocted a story and dragged in (under false pretenses) those who were not involved. These people removed the government of the country and bombed, as well as continue to kill, people who are innocents. This makes the US a war criminal country. The US government knows this and that is why they will not sign a world court treaty because all the US politicians who ok'd the war crimes would be hauled off to Europe for trials just like the Germans and Japanese were after World War II. If they weren't guilty of war crimes, they would sign the treaty. Notice how quickly that the US wanted Serbian \"war criminals\" on trial. Well, what's good for the goose is good for the gander! Now Emperor Bush is foaming at the mouth for another war with Iraq. He has assembled all kinds of horseshit reasons in a panicked attempt to stir the public. He is working as Israel's surrogate and also is interested in Iraqi oil plus other things. He's grasping at straws to link a minor islamic group to everything wrong (in his opinion) in the world today. He is hoping the American people buy into his fantasies. The Very Advanced and higher will not. It is very easy to see through this type of manipulation when you are in these latter stages of your progression through the Game. People should question 'why should I kill them if they have done nothing to me'. Tell those who want to drag you into their hatred to fuck off for the false reasons they give as 'truth'. If enough people said this, it would be less likely that there would be war. Why the fuck should I fight YOUR battles when they haven't done a single damned thing to me AND, not only that, they said that I'm part of the people they aren’t pissed at?! They're pissed at you (Bush)? Fuck that...it's your problem because you certainly aren't going to come help me when I have a problem with someone who doesn’t like me. Enter the minion faction. Here you have blind followers - the herd/group mentality. THESE will make war at the drop of a hat and enjoy following the leader or perceived alpha type as they do in the animal kingdoms. This is one of the reasons why they want so many minions on Earth and why the majority of the planet's population is minion. Minions are meant as counters to the Very Advanced groups, for one, and would help in rallying the Low and Mid level incarnates to their leaders' will. Finally there's the Game itself.

Observation: White House Cries 'Wolf AGAIN Today's news is beating the usual 'fear' drum that they have been beating for the past 1.5 yrs. Once again the alerts are flying color 'orange' to increase the fear of the locals in the US. The White House dictator is concerned because the people are not behind his empire building and war/blood lusts (SO reptilian). Now they say these omnipresent 'terrorists' are targeting hotels, sporting events and so on. I DO expect that if something should happen, during this Year From Hell, that it is far more likely that Dark government forces are behind it. Another staged event like 9/11/02. This will be so the dictator can stir the US population to march to his warped tune. Then the regional talk show (radio) was trying their best to instill fear into people as well and these 2 Bushites were calling for blood. When a caller responded with anything BUT the reptilian/blood party line, they were harassed and belittled for not conforming. This applied to many of the callers. Some dared to suggest Israel is behind much of this Middle Eastern mess. They ARE correct, but I bet you can figure out what these 2 Bushites yelled....the tired, old word, \"anti-semitic\". ANYONE who uses 'anti-semitic' as a synonym for anti-Israel is part of the Dark agenda. You absolutely can be anti-Israel and not anti- semitic. It is interesting to see how people go on the defensive when this term is used. They should tell the term caster to shut the fuck up! Of course you can add an exclamation point to that by blowing your nose in an Israeli flag. Israel IS the Nazi Germany of the current era. NEVER go on the defensive for your positions. If you do, you appear weak and your position is indefensible. The Year From Hell is getting more and more interesting almost by the day. I saw an Air National Guard officer (major) wearing his brown khaki jumpsuit in a store. On his sleeve is a patch with a reptilian head, complete with horns and their eyes.

Genetics and technology are priorities for the Orion Empire in it’s battle to bring immortality to the physical. It IS a no-win position, but they aren't spiritually Advanced enough to know that even though they are the oldest race in this galaxy. Observation: Orion \"Princess\" Mode In the Orion Empire, the queen has many daughters by birth and many more by favor. Their title is 'princess'. They are emissaries of the Orion reptilian queen. In Earth history it use to be that the daughter(s) of kings/queens were called 'princess' and the sons were 'princes'. The 'princes' were a reflection of the Sirian Empire where the king rules. Earther history reflected the 'as above, so below' in that the king/queen was a minor reflection of the Orion/Sirian Empires' queen/king setup. They sought to emulate the alien ranking. This is also true in priesthoods. When the Orion Empire plans it's return to Earth, the queen herself won't be on a ship, but rather one of her 'daughters', a princess of the Empire. It has been a relatively modern Earther thing to refer to female children as 'princesses'. One thing you rarely hear is male children referred to as 'prince'. This involves alien programming and the dominance of the Orion reptilian female over the reptilian male. This is pure conditioning. You have to be Advanced enough to recognize it. The Empire loves using subtle approaches when it can, like a virus that enters the body and you don't realize it until too late. Looking in various catalogs, I see LOTS of 'princess' this and 'princess' that. This is indoctrinating human female children to rule over males. It is not the cutsie thing many thing it is. Candy coating poison so that it tastes sweet does not negate the poison or the effects the poison has on your system. If you look hard and long enough, you may find a token 'prince' shirt for a boy, but you'll sooner find items where the boy is the 'hero' to serve the female. The use of 'prince' is equated more with being a servant of the 'princess' as the Orion males serve the Orion females. Fathers are obeying their DNA command structure in kneeling to their daughter ('princess'). They are programmed to encourage this mode. You have to be quite Advanced to resist that command. This DNA command is but one tentacle on the octopus of female dominance that the Orion genetic scientists installed in Earther bodies to activate at certain time periods like time bombs. Since Earth is targeted to become an overt member of the Orion Empire, the aliens want to adjust mindsets to conform to Empire standards and that places female dominance at the top of the list. We've all heard of'jewish princess', 'black princess' and various forms of it. You tend not to hear queen used the same way. In the Empire there is only ONE real queen and she is very jealous of her position. However there are many 'princesses'. Queen is very mockingly used on Earth in such terms as 'drag queen' or 'gym queen'. It is also used in 'queen sized' items of clothing. You also have prom, parade and other silly 'queens' of no power. Note here too, outside of proms, kings are scarce. These 'queens' are only princesses with delusions of grandeur. When 'queen' is seriously mentioned on Earth, it's Lizard- breath the second in London that people first think of, although there are a few other minor figurehead queens running around of no consequence. This brings up the rebel faction of the Orion power plays. For more on this, refer back to Matrix 5. The only institution that contains 'princes' is the catholic church.

Don't be deceived by what you see on the surface of conformity or seeming innocence. Don't ever settle for what's on the surface. While watching an ancient 'Donna Reed' show on TVLand cable, there was an episode where Donna is instructing her daughter on how to control men, do it stealthily and make them think that your ideas are his. That was in the late so's. That is another form of the Orion programming. Females really believe they have the right to be a 'princess' and be treated as such (DNA command structure). This has rapidly increased in EndGame. Watch, observe and analyze with your spirit and not with your Orion DNA command physical IF you want to see just how the Game is trying to manipulate you. It's insidious. 'Princess' - yeah, right. Observation: Anti-Male Hatred Rages On (Orion Influence) Last month I wrote a segment on the Orion \"princess\" mentality. Now I've found an excellent article that deals with that subject. Of course it doesn't mention the Orion factor as most Earthers are too stupid to believe that they are anything but the center of the universe. The rabid anti-male attitudes of women, especially American women, has added to the decline of western civilization to make it increasingly an Orion civilization. Yes, this is the Game and the Dark polarity. Yes, this involves experience...BUT I never said you had to agree with the Game, the polarities or viewing/living in certain experiences. They have to be taken on an individual level. One person's experience can be another's observation. With that in mind, and with the intended return of the Orion Empire to rule Earth, I am including this article to increase your awareness of the pervasive influence of Body-ID: Anti-Male Bias Increasingly Pervades US Culture By John Leo MensNewsDaily.com 9-7-2 A famous television newswoman told this joke last month at a fund-raising dinner for a women's college: A woman needed a brain transplant. Her doctor said two brains were available, a woman's brain for $500 and a man's brain for $5,000. Why the big price difference? Answer: The woman's brain has been used. Most in the audience laughed, but one man stood up and booed. What's wrong? asked a woman at his table. The man said, \"Just substitute woman, black or Jew for 'man' in that joke, and tell me how it sounds.\" At about the same time, American Greeting Cards launched an ad campaign in Newsweek, Life and other magazines. One ad featured a \"Thelma and Louise\" greeting card, pasted into the magazines, that said on the front: \"Men are always whining about how we are suffocating them.\" The punch line inside the card was this: \"Personally, I think if you can hear them whining, you're not pressing hard enough on the pillow.\" The newswoman, who is a friend, seemed shocked when I phoned and raised questions about her joke. \"The poor, sensitive white male,\" she said. A spokesman for the greeting card company saw nothing wrong with a humorous card about a woman killing a man. He faxed a statement saying the card had been pretested successfully, and besides, \"We've heard no protests from consumers who are buying and using this card.\" But would American Greetings print a card with the sexes reversed, so the humor came from men joking about suffocating a woman? No, said the spokesman, because 85 percent to 90 percent of cards are bought by women. There is no market for a reverse card.

All Rights Reserved. In truth, no man could get up at a fancy banquet and tell a joke about how stupid women are. And a greeting card joking about a woman's murder would be very unlikely, even if surveys showed that millions of males were eager to exchange lighthearted gender-killing greetings. The obvious is true: A sturdy double standard has emerged in the gender wars. \"There used to be a certain level of good-natured teasing between the sexes,\" says Christina Sommers, author of \"Who Stole Feminism?\" \"Now even the most innocent remark about women will get you in trouble, but there's no limit at all to what you can say about men.\" Men's rights groups phone me a lot, and I tell them my general position on these matters: The last thing we need in America is yet another victim group, this one made up seriously aggrieved males. But these groups do have an unmissable point about double standards. On the \"Today\" show last November, Katie Couric suddenly deviated from perkiness and asked a jilted bride, \"Have you considered castration as an option?\" Nobody seemed to object. Fred Hayward, a men's rights organizer, says: \"Imagine the reaction if Matt Lauer had asked a jilted groom, 'Wouldn't you just like to rip her uterus out?\"' The double standard is rooted in identity politics and fashionable theories about victimization: Men as a group are oppressors; jokes that oppressors use to degrade the oppressed must be taken seriously and suppressed. Jokes by the oppressed against oppressors, however, are liberating and progressive. So while sexual harassment doctrine cracks down on the most harmless jokes about women, very hostile humor about men keeps expanding with almost no objections. Until recently, for example, the 3M company put out post-it notes with the printed message: \"Men have only two faults: everything they say and everything they do.\" Anti-male greeting cards are increasingly graphic, with some of the most hostile coming from Hallmark Cards' Shoebox Division. (Sample: \"Men are scum ... Excuse me. For a second there I was feeling generous.\") Columnist Cathy Young sees a rising tide of male-bashing, including \"All Men Are Bastards\" and \"Men We Love to Hate\" calendars, and a resentful \"It's-always-his-fault\" attitude pervading women's magazines. Commercial attempts to increase the amount of sexual antagonism in America are never a good idea. And if you keep attacking men as a group, they will eventually start acting as a group, something we should fervently avoid. But the worst impact of all the male-bashing is on the young. Barbara Wilder-Smith, a teacher and researcher in the Boston area, was recently quoted in several newspapers on how deeply anti-male attitudes have affected the schools. When she made \"Boys Are Good\" T-shirts for boys in her class, all 10 of the female student teachers under her supervision objected to the message. (One, she said, was wearing a button saying \"So many men, so little intelligence.\") \"My son can't even wear the shirt out in his back yard,\" she said. \"People see it and object strongly and shout things.\" On the other hand, she says, nobody objects when the girls wear shirts that say \"Girls Rule\" or when they taunt the boys with a chant that goes, \"Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider; girls go to college to get more knowledge.\" Worse, she says, many adolescent boys object to the \"Boys Are Good\" shirts too, because they have come to accept the cultural message that something is seriously wrong with being a male. \"The time is ripe for people to think about the unspoken anti-male 'ism' in our colleges and schools,\" she says. And in the rest of the popular culture as well. http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/st0ries/le0090402.htm 312"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Observation: Orion Female Agenda Rampages On I have this new ABC Distribution fall catalog in front of me.

Shirt is chock-full of choice conversational openers in a variety of colors.\" \"Colorful observations\" and \"Choice conversational openers\" trivialize the seriousness of the Orion DNA plague on Earth now. Here's SOME of what is written on these items: -Boys Lie -Boys Have Cooties -Too much princess for one boy -Princess(princess)n. see me -Spoiled rotten -I Have Issues I hope most of you can see where this is all going. The Orion spin has increased to a deafening level. Female dominance is progressing so rapidly in the Orion mode and, unfortunately, most males are falling for this lock, stock and barrel. This set above is obviously for young girls and programs them to embrace their Orion DNA commands AND, for boys who see this, to surrender to their Orion DNA command structure. 'Boys Lie' - actually it's not the boys who live a lie. It’s females who cover themselves in make-up, dyes and loads of artificial enhancements throughout most of their lives to make their appearance a lie. 'Boys have cooties'? Well, if this is the case, why do non-lesbian females spend most of their time chasing after boys? 'Princess' - that is a direct Orion DNA connection where reptilian females, of the royal lineage, are all considered 'princess' and 'daughter of the queen'. 'Too much princess for one boy' - Orion female royals have multiply male consorts. 'Spoiled rotten' - well that speaks for itself and what they expect. Using the word 'rotten' says it all though. What do you do with something rotten? You throw it in the trash where it belongs! 'I have issues' - yes, you do and they are not what you think they are. Summary: If boys are such liars with bugs living on them and you are so royal, why would you want to be associated with a boy? Who's living the lie here?

In one part of the movie, an elf is reading off names for Santa to pass judgment on being \"naughty or nice\". Every boy's name read was judged \"bad\". Every girl's name read was judged \"good\". You should be able to see the subliminal message here. In the 1930's, a German said that if you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it is a truth. This is being used by the fascists in power in the US in regard to Iraq and everyone else they don't like. It is also being used by the media and other organs of Orion propaganda to demean the males and artificially raise the females. This is very similar to how the Orion females took power from the males, even though the final coup was violent by the reptilian females. As per previous segments of Matrix 5 materials, I've written about the violent nature of females which is FAR more violent than that of males. If you have to ask 'why', then you are not yet ready for the Matrix 5 materials and your Orion DNA commands are calling you. In a Sopranos episode on HBO last night, an intervention was set up for a drug using younger gangster. One of the people there was his mother who encouraged that her son have sense knocked into him (violence encouraging). At one point, when he was being particularly set upon by the others, the mother chimed in and he responded, \"Shut up, you fucking whore\". She gasped and several men there immediately started to beat this guy. Do you wonder why women can say WHATEVER they feel like (at least in the US) and EXPECT to get away with it (unless another female is involved)? Do you wonder why women are responsible for most of the violence in America today (and throughout history by getting men to carry out their demands)? This is one of the oldest Orion DNA commands - protect the woman. At one time, when women were women, this was understandable. Since women have been DEMANDING that they are treated equally (as men), this is no longer a valid position. At their insistence, they should be treated the same as men. Hence, if she hits you, you have the right to hit her back. While this is evident from the position of Balance, this moves beyond the Game, especially in the current EndGame. The Game is well along moving to female dominance and overt Orion Empire control. The Game is well along moving Earth to a sequential alien planet. Those who have reached Very Advanced stages and higher want OFF of this planet and OUT of this density, seeing that it is almost totally down the drain. If it wasn't for EndGame, it would get far worse than it is now. What other anti-male propaganda is out there? It is EVERYWHERE to those who are even semi-sharp in their observations. 'Man bad...woman good' is the popular mantra. The male counterpart to the Orion DNA commands is to agree with this bullshit. Men, as a group, have given their power away to women who DON'T deserve it. Due to the advanced stages of this perversion, it is being forced on countries with different ideals. This is necessary for Earth to be sequential - a homogenous culture. This is necessary to make the Orion rule easier for THEM. Women attack male genitals (but yet can't get enough of having them around). Penis envy is stronger than ever. Since they cannot have them, they ridicule them.

Men are put down by women and other men. This will increase even beyond the shrill volume of today. Hurry final stages of EndGame!!! The crap the females put out is deception just as much as the daily deceptions about themselves. Just as they use make-up, wigs, all manner of costumes/jewelry to cover up who they really are. They FEAR their true selves and their appearance. They FEAR the male gender. The best way to cover up fear is to ridicule, to point the finger at what one fears in order to draw attention away from yourself. Females excel at this because they have discovered it works for them. Ridicule of men, violence to men and the attempts to reverse the roles intended will continue to rise. The men who put up with this are in bodies too submissive to Orion DNA commands, hence occupied by minions or spirits not Advanced enough to overrule the body. Yes, this is experience, even though of a perverse sort. This is embraced by the Lightsiders and is one of the features of the Light polarity today. If a female says she would like to hit me, I always warn her to be careful because I WILL hit back. That itself keeps them back because they can tell I mean it. You notice, that women talk bullshit, but when called on it, they run for a MAN to carry out their will. If no man is there to carry out their will, they would return to the place that they were meant to have without Orion reptilian tampering. This is just part of what you will discover when you move into Very Advanced stages in regard to genders on Earth. I have given you several segments on these topics in Matrix 5 materials. It is up to you to enhance them, become strong enough in spirit to override the Orion DNA commands (it WILL happen) and learn from what is happening today. Observe, but restrict participation. The more you participate, the less you can observe correctly. Observation: Violence Against Men Encouraged In today's (11/24/02) Sunday newspaper's editorial page, a 'cartoon' appears with female golfers engaging in violence against men and men's property This is in reference to females joining the male-only golf club in Augusta, Georgia. The drawing shows 3 females hitting golf balls to break windows (shown) and cause harm to men (2 are unconscious on the ground with golf balls around them). Where is all that 'stop the violence' mantras that we have to hear daily? You won’t likely hear it when it applies to the violent nature of females against males. This editorial cartoon is only one of countless examples of it being fine for females to be violent to men. This is PURE Orion mode, although this is the first time I've seen it on an editorial page. This is unacceptable to Very Advanced and higher incarnations. This is also the Game. I have been saying over and over that it would get much worse. Women are encouraged to be violent, both physically and verbally, with men. This is because whipped males, under total Orion DNA commands, obey the female at all costs. What can you do about this. In the general or global sense - nothing. What you can do individually is, if you have moved to the Very Advanced stages where you can override your physical DNA commands in this area, is to refuse to play in this section of the Game. If ANYONE decides they want to get violent with you, you can allow it (Lightsiders) or give them a dose of what they had out (instant balance). While violence is not recommended by anyone, if you are attacked, it is your right to return the favor. If females know that their violent nature will not be tolerated, they will hesitate to engage in the activity. If they know you are whipped and Orion DNA obedient, they will have a field day with you.

Observation: Orion in Disney When I was in Orlando, Florida, I enjoyed the Disney Halloween atmosphere and the parades, both regular and special Halloween. One character that was prominent was Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty. She seemed to be all over, in the parades, in the evening MGM show Fantasmic and at the Halloween night where the most commonly worn costume by female attendees was Maleficent. I commented to one there that Maleficent clones were busy tonight. Examine the character...the horns (a characteristic of the reptilians even though they are not correctly shown on the character), the shape shifting ability (she changes from a woman into the winged dragon (which is royal Orion reptilian) and the commanding, cold personality (typical of Orion royal females). In Fantasmic, in her huge dragon form, she is the central villain. The villains here threaten to take control of your dreams. There is a fair amount of Dark/Light banter and one piece of Lightsider propaganda which I just had to laugh out loud at: \"Light will always defeat the Dark\". This is an illusion that I've discussed elsewhere in Matrix 5. Jafar from Aladdin is in Fantasmic and changes into his snake form. Yeah, reptilians everywhere. Jafar proves far less threatening here than the dragon. This goes along with Orion females being far more vicious than Orion males. Another visible character last week was the queen from Snow White. I watched as an actress portrayed her both in MGM and the Magic Kingdom. She was cold, aloof and very reserved, just as in the film. Once again, you have a shape shifting character of pure Dark side (all for/about me). This queen deals in poison (natural talent of Orion females). This queen was perfectly portrayed at Disney and showed almost as much disdain for Earthers as the Orion queen does. One more character I want to mention here is Figment at EPCOTs Imagination building. Figment is the cute winged dragon that talks to people about imagination. At the start of the ride, the actor is talking to those in the ride and Figment shows up. During the banter that they have, Figment licks the actor on the face and says, \"Tastes like chicken!\". Here you have a cute version of an Orion royal with wings and the comment that humans taste like chicken implying the need for humans as food. Disney's Animal Kingdom also has a dragon in its symbol. Expansion plans are said to include bringing dragons more and more into that section of the park. While I had a wonderful time in Disney, I kept my observations on full. This is something the Very Advanced and above should continually do wherever they go. You can never know what you will see that you aren't expected to notice. Remember, always look deeper than the surface presentation. Observation: Rigelian culture - China I spent 10 days in China, one of the larger Rigelian manipulated cultures on Earth.

When I was in Shanghai, at the end of my Adventure, I was taken to the local catholic cathedral as 2 of my fellow travelers wanted to see it. It was quite UNimpressive. One of the women (mid-60's) went on this preachy bit with the local guide about their deity, Mary, supposedly appearing around the world in different ethnic make-ups. I saw she was attempting to dazzle the Chinese guide (a young woman in her early 20's). I responded with how these are all alien holographic projections intended to stimulate submission to the religion and a giving away of one's power. The woman responded, \"but we have to believe in something\". Of course, where she is on her path does require that power giveaway, but her defensiveness was based on belief rather than conviction. It is impossible for someone at her level to comprehend that you must look within to escape the Game. Since nothing more was asked of me, I said no more on that subject because both her and the guide have to decide what is best for them. When the 2 women went to the can, I told the guide that you have to be wary of both Christians and muslims (one god religions) as they are deceptive in their practices. They come in with this faux humility, then when they gain a foothold, they attempt to subvert everyone to their beliefs in a fervor of 'misery loves company' and condemn those who do not live as they want them to. I told her how, in the US, that American Christians are constantly trying to get everyone to conform to their beliefs and standards. I told her if given the chance, they would also try to do so in China. I found the Chinese significantly different and, while very interesting to spend 10 days there, it is not a culture I'd prefer to live in in my Final Incarnation. The American government would have us believe they are like Stalinist Russia, which is far from true. China is very modern, many people are glued to cell phones, just as in America. The cities are clean and, especially Shanghai, have wonderful architecture. Goods are plentiful and the stores are stocked with wide varieties of produce. American propaganda lies a lot. That's the Game for you. The guide I had in Beijing is a minion. Not a flicker of Higher Self in the eyes, very flat. The same went for my first guide in central China. However, my final guide, in Shanghai, is a Higher Self incarnate, but of mid-level incarnation. The Forbidden City is a strong vortex area and my Dominant Incarnation was waiting for me when I passed through the 3rd gate, even though she exists a few hundred years ago. I received so much information on this trip that I will be processing it for some time. It was a wonderful, Eventful experience for me. The women in China have not reached the obnoxious level of the women in America, but then they've only been moving to the Orion dominance level since the 50's after Mao came to power. The current relationship male/female in China seems to be mostly on par with equality. However, with western influence strong (on tv, advertising), I can see that the Game will eventually (with enough time) move to influence Chinese women to become more like their western counterparts. Then I came back to the US and was again soaked in the bullshit of female dominance that is even more oppressive than before.

Observations: Zimbabwe & the Nibiru With the sham Zimbabwe election's anti-European sentiment AND the support for it from all the other black African countries, I wouldn't be surprised if the Nibiru are behind it. The Nibiru/Annanakki are the ones behind the formation of the black race (they took over in that area after the Orion Empire did their gender splitting thing on Ancient Earthers). Since the Nibiru are returning AND they have something in mind for the slave race they created (possibly taking all their non-grossly mixed and pure blacks off Earth to be slaves elsewhere), the central/southern African leaders are aware and want to rid themselves of the Europeans. The deception is that while American Mulsim leaders think the aliens mean them well, they do not. It's just another alien deception on these people. This whole matter is really murky though and I'll be interested to see how it unfolds. Notice how Mugabe has a mini-Hitler mustache? Black Nazis, Israeli Nazis, American Nazis...Nazis, Nazis everywhere. The Empire is returning. Observation: Death of a U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone, US Senator from Minnesota, was killed in a plane crash along with his wife and daughter. Expect the usual hand wringing from his political enemies over this. This is the surface event. It is NOT a Wild Card. A Wild Card is an Event of a global nature, not regional or national, but GLOBAL. Nevertheless, this event was instituted to remove someone who was not an ally of Emperor Bush. Those of you who have been watching the political movements in the US know that only 1 US Senate vote keeps Emperor Bush from dominating Congress. Due to this, I will give you some food for thought: *In Missouri some years back, the Democratic challenger to then-Senator Ashcroft was also killed in a plane crash. The difference between this and Wellstone's is that those who manufactured this event did not count on the dead opponent's wife to run in her husband's place. This was a miscalculation on their part. *In Minnesota today, not wanting to repeat the 'miscalculation' of Missouri, the candidates wife was also removed from the scene AND this event happened only days away from the election. *1 was asked if Ted Kennedy is a target for the fascists. No. He's part of the problem. Remember when you watch the theatrics on 3rd density Earth that if they want you to notice someone, they will put the spotlight on him as much as possible. Those in the spotlight are NOT the people to watch. If they want you to look at A, you better look at everyone BUT A. This was the case with Wellstone. Now take what I've just given you and come to your own conclusions. Correct answers are located in the 'current events' section of the Library on Monroe level 27. This is the Game in action! Certain things must happen in EndGame. The simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves ARE paying attention to what is happening here as well.

This is all part of EndGame and, it hasn't \"begun\", as I've heard said. It is Well advanced. For those who are Observers, you need to look deeper, much deeper at developing events/situations in order to see the roots of the issues. What you get on the news, in the papers, etc is propaganda from that country's government. If you believe what they say, then you are still being manipulated BY the Game. This is not either good or bad. It is where YOU are in the Game. The 'news' should not be the omega (end) of information, but rather the alpha (start). What I release, in the Matrix 5 segments, is for a relatively few people because so few are ready to grasp it all. Yeah, I know there are a lot of wanna be \"Awakened Final\" readers of the Matrix 5 materials who are not ready for it, but you are only deceiving yourself if you can't admit your current incarnation's limitations to yourself. Also...very important...you must, and I mean MUST, learn to accept responsibility for what you say or do. People have told me their opinions or emailed them to me and, when I point out their errors in their opinions, they come back with \"that's not what I meant\" and try to make their problem my responsibility. Now, it OK to make errors, we all do while incarnated. However maturity is to accept responsibility for yourself. If you tell me something, and I respond to what you said, AND you respond with \"that's not what I meant\", the problem is YOURS. You must learn to say what you mean. I have been given the 2 step/backtrack and a flurry of reasons why I should be able to read their minds. This is avoiding responsibility on the part of the person. The correct response is something like \"I said that wrong; let me rephrase that\" or just plain: \"I was wrong\". Don't sink in the quicksand of your ego. Admitting error allows you to progress over ego. Meanwhile, EndGame proceeds. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Observation: Shuttle Craft Columbia Explodes Over Texas ALL day long, and I DO mean ALL day long, American television has been focused on the American shuttle, Columbia, that exploded over Texas today. 7 people died. Well, military helicopters/planes crash as well as small civilian planes crash and they don't get more than a few lines in the national news. BBC America states that this explosion is almost to the day years ago (1986) when the Challenger shuttle exploded. Hmmm. Can you Find any suspicious clues here? Interestingly Israel's first astronaut died in the explosion. He was carrying a drawing made by a 14 yr old teenager killed during WWII in one of Europe's death camps. BBC America said this 14 yr old was gassed then burned in the ovens. A vibration that would be held in the artwork and a tie to that period. When I visited Auschwitz in Poland, during my last year of college, we were allowed to walk around the deserted camp next to the museum original site. This was before I started my psychic trainings. I found a glass insulator on the ground near the electric, barbed wire fences. I picked it up and was flooded with the most awful vibrations I have ever felt. I put it back on the ground. You don't want to carry around artifacts from a death camp. They carry their vibrations with them. Taking that object on the shuttle did no one any favors. 319"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"However while I feel that was not an appropriate item to take into space, that was not the reason for the explosion although that added to the tragedy. The 1986 shuttle was widely agreed upon, in Advanced circles, to have been zapped by an alien group as a warning to Earth. The sequentials, ALL sequential groups, want simultaneously incarnating Earthers to be contained on Earth. Matrix 5 readers know that the Orion Empire is planning to return. There are various alien craft (large, small and HUGE) in our solar system. Did this shuttle see something it was not supposed to? Was something given to this shuttle by one alien group that another did not want to be delivered on Earth? Maybe yes. Maybe no. If the aliens were responsible, you'll never hear that from any 'official' sources. It is no coincidence that the shuttle was destroyed above Texas, home state, of the White House lizard, Adolph von Bush. A message to him as well? I wouldn't doubt it, rather I would expect it especially since Bush is threatening to use nukes in Iraq and anywhere else where they don't bow to him. The aliens do not want Earth nuked and ruining the resources they want to plunder more of. NASA has said this did not happen due to \"anything on Earth\". THAT is also worth noting. Yes, of course Bush's favorite terrorist scapegoats (in this the Chinese year of the goat) aren't blamed for the explosion. The way that these shuttles are overly checked, and with much heightened security in Florida for this shuttle, mechanical problem excuses won't fly, although I think that this is what they will eventually sing to the public: tiles fell off or some such nonsense. Bush said that these people are \"heroes\". Talk about cheapening the word, but dictatorships and oppressive governments are always looking for heroes. The only valid hero is someone who does something extraordinary, usually at the risk of life, that is spontaneous. If someone is paid to do a job and danger is part of the risk, if they die because of a job related risk, that does not make them a hero. They knew the risks. An example of a real hero would be a bystander who pulls someone out of a burning building. It is a fireman's job to do that. He is being paid to do that. The bystander is not. But in these fascist, heil Bush days, you will hear more and more of pseudo heroes. I haven't heard so much of that hero bullshit since the Soviet heydays in recent history. One more observation for today (Feb 1,03): In today's newspaper, on the front page, is an article reporting that \"the Bush administration is revamping decades-old labor regulations in an overhaul that could force many Americans to work longer hours without overtime pay\". \"The administration argues that the pillars of American labor law, which established the 40-hour work week, a minimum wage and overtime pay, are antiquated.\" This is likely not be well noticed due to the explosion. This is a dictatorship tactic AND is a facet of a return to slavery of the populace. Do you think you would have the benefits you have working today if the Orion Empire succeeds in returning and makes this an overt slave planet. No Way! The fascist White House will continue to look for ways to strip away what we still have in order to prepare for one possible Wild Card that is desperate to be played. The Year from Hell has just begun. Stay tuned and OBSERVE! [Ed.- (Feb 9 AP News) Late Saturday February 8, NASA said the U.S. Strategic Command apparently tracked something flying near Columbia after it had reached orbit. Space agency spokeswoman Eileen Hawley said it was possible the object came from Columbia, but stressed \"this is very raw data\" that had just been turned over to investigators and that it was too early to speculate. One day after Columbia's Jan. 16 launch, military radar detected an object moving rapidly away from the shuttle. ] MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

'Time', 'American Freedoms' & Incarnational Visitations (Special Gold Edition Segment) When I was apprenticed to a Native American shaman, I would call her just after midnight on New Year’s Eve and say, \"I'm calling you from the future. It's Jan l here and Dec 31 by you.\" Using that logic, it IS the future, however events all around the world are happening simultaneously irregardless of the date or clock time. Since this is so, what is clock time? Time is an artificial measuring of something that doesn't exist. Just because something happens on 3:00am in China on Dec 19, but yet it's still the day before where you live, does that mean you can alter events because you 'know' what's going to happen in 12 hrs from your current time? Of course not. Time does not exist. It is just this lack of time that allows simultaneous incarnating Higher Selves to exist in whatever 'time periods’ they should choose to experience. The Game wants you to buy into the illusion of time, just as the American government wants you to buy into the illusion of American freedom. Just as time does not exist, neither do American freedoms. Just as you are manipulated by the 'limits of time', you are manipulated by the skillfully deceptive use of the word 'freedom'. I saw people walking the Underground Railroad route from the Civil War days. This was the route fleeing slaves used to enter northern states for 'freedom'. Visualize southern slaves as in a small box called slavery. They escaped this box only to move into another fenced in area for, although in the north they weren't slaves, they were certainly far from 'free'. It took almost another 100 years for serious progress to be made here. The common myth is that the Civil War was fought over slavery. This isn't true and Lincoln didn't want to free slaves until the near the end of the war and ONLY as a last resort. The American Constitution provides for any state that wishes to exit the Union. When this was used by the southern states, the illusion of American freedoms was shown and the Constitution no longer in force. The northern states refused to honor the Constitution and Lincoln became a major tool for the Game and those earlier stages of the One World government. The Game required the US be kept as it was despite the illusionary Constitution. American propaganda and historical rewriting, of course, would prefer you to believe that Lincoln moved to preserve the Union despite it being an unconstitutional move on his part. They would also prefer you to believe it was a war to 'free the slaves'. It was not. It was a war to subvert states' rights to the central government despite the ultimate 'law of the land', the Constitution. The Library on Level 27 contains much more untainted, interesting information on this and any other historical event. Think of this major event in relation to the use of ’time'. Since Earther Higher Selves are simultaneous incarnates that means that the Civil War (and the Roman expansion, WWII, Crusades, etc) are occurring now just as you are reading this and I am writing. Just the contemplating of this can be a real mind-blower and something definitely for those of a Very Advanced or higher incarnational level. If you've read Robert Monroe's trilogy, you know in one book he visits a few of his incarnations at their point of death (ancient battlefield/African village/early 20th century New York City). Although he was in the 'Robert Monroe' incarnation's current time period, when he visited these incarnations, their time period is active. This is an ability of simultaneous incarnating Higher Selves. Each incarnation serves as an anchor to that frequency and makes an easy entry point for the Dominants or the Final Incarnation.

Likewise you, as your Dominant or, especially, your Awakened Final Incarnation can visit any of your incarnations in any time period you are incarnate whether it is American Civil War, Atlantis, Dark Ages, the Egypt of Pharoah, etc. This can be done either through any incarnational stream from inside your Higher Self. This is a fast way: by touching the face on the Higher Self inner wall, you immediately see through that incarnation's eyes what he or she sees. Another way is to just will yourself to where an incarnation is. However, with this mode, you should have some idea which incarnation. You can learn of these incarnations on Monroe's focus level 27 in the Library or with other creative means at your disposal on that level. Your Awakened Final Incarnation receives a massive amount of information/abilities in preparation for the Incarnational Recall and Advancement to Higher Densities. Yes, it IS fascinating and even if your current incarnation is not at that level, you DO have one that is somewhere in time. Your reading of the Matrix 5 materials is helping that one in another frequency. Some EndGame Observations Two of many Observations: CNN reports that catholics, in almost all cases, are pledging MORE money to their church despite the corrupt priesthood. Sheeple of the religion FEAR facing the truth about their church, so they ignore it. If they paid attention, they would have to face the reality of religion and their non-existent gods. Bush is wagging the dog daily. One of the latest is arresting someone for thinking about building a 'dirty nuke'. Shades of the Tom Cruise film, Minority Report, due out late June where they arrest you because of a supposed murder you’ll commit in the future. They label that fantasy, when it is reality and present day! The majority of American residents call for more of their constitutional, paper freedoms to be taken away in the guise of security. Ben Franklin said to his peers at the time that America would give away all the freedoms they place in the constitution. Ben Franklin was one of those who knew the general direction of the future. He was also part of the Game. You are labeled a 'trouble maker' for daring to disagree with emperor Bush, just like those who disagreed with Hitler in the 30's. Without 'trouble makers', Americans would still be overt British citizens and would still own slaves or be slaves, just to site 2 examples of the benefits of 'trouble makers'. Everywhere you look, depending on your level of Advancement/Awareness, you see both massive and minor examples of the deterioration of 3rd density Earth. Those listed above are just a few. These are part of the Game's current/final phases. I'm amazed how so many Americans would rather wrap themselves in the fog of illusionary freedoms/beLIEfs than face realities of religion and government. On the news last night, a shill for the government said that if a nuke went off in DC, \"people would lose faith in their government\". In other words, they might sec the government for what it is and is not. Control/fear...trust us, we know what is best for you - these arc the current government means and motto for the citizenry.

Observation: Dance of the Vampires Dance of the Vampires, a Broadway (New York) musical, will be closing late January 2003 after only 3 months. The reason given is 'bad reviews', although it plays to packed audiences. I just returned from seeing it. It is an outstanding play. Everyone I talked to after the show said it was one of the best they had ever seen. So, why is it closing? Mama Mia, also an excellent Broadway musical, got bad reviews but has been playing to packed audiences as well. It isn't closing. Dance of the Vampires is a musical where there is a wonderfully, unique twist to the ending. The Darkside wins. The play takes place in the 1880's in Transylvania. After a neat opening number/dance, Count von Krolock's coffin rises from the ground with lots of smoke and special effects. The 2 women say, \"God help us\". The coffin opens and Krolock says, \"God has left the building\". That's the first clue that this is a very different play. Interestingly, the female lead chooses to be with the Count and to become a vampire over being with her suitor, Alfred. Even when Alfred and Professor Abronsius 'rescue' her from the vampires, despite her not wanting to go, I thought the ending would prove standard death-of-vampires stuff when the sunlight hits Krolock. I was pleasantly surprised to see it wasn't so. Krolock doesn't die and you see him again at the very end of the show. The female lead had already been made a vampire before her rescue and winds up biting her suitor, Alfred changing him into another vampire. The finale is an extensive dance/song number taking the audience from 1880's to 2080's where everyone is now a vampire. Time Square has loads of ads, just as usual, but with a vampiric twist. Some examples: Virgin Air is now Sacrificial Virgin, Tang is Fang, Cats (the musical) is now Bats and the Rolling Stones are the Rolling Bones. Very clever. The lyrics of the finale deal with how the vampires have come to rule the world, \"We drink your blood. We eat your souls.\" are sung. This got a rousing, standing ovation with cheering. It was excellently done. The Darkside was brazen in advertising. On exiting the theater, I did hear two Lightsiders express unease over the ending. \"They should have all died\", said one. Lightsiders do NOT like it when they can't have their fantasies! The vampire image is based on the reptilians who DO drink human blood. Remember I told you that the Orion queen intends to make Earth overtly part of their Empire. The conquest of Earth in the play corresponds to the Orion Empires intended assimilation of Earth. Dark MA TR1X V: The Gold Edition 323"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"wins Earth. Even the songs in the play stress over and over to \"escape from the Light\" and \"remove the bindings of your imagination\". The play has lots of humor in it. Dark does indeed have humor. The female lead tells Krolock that she turns 18 in 3 days, on Halloween, at midnight during the eclipse of the Moon. The vampire looks to the audience and says, \"It can't get any better\". This happens a few times during the play. The dream sequence song \"Carpe Noctem\", seize the night, was a rousing number about escaping the Light. The vampires say that once the planet is all vampire then they can live in the daylight. In my opinion, their 'daylight' here is basking in the glow of the Orion queen. If you have the chance to see this play before it closes this month, do see it. The Dark side very, very rarely does this type of thing and they do it here with music and humor. I believe that this is the ultimate reason why it is being axed - the Lightside does NOT appreciate it. Balance definitely does, however, and you must embrace and integrate the Dark with the Light to reach Balance, as I've said in other segments. The polarities are also VERY body oriented. The vampires stress immortality of the body, an Orion obsession, yet the soul is no longer there. This is depicted by no reflection in the mirror when one is a vampire. The Orion queen doesn't want our souls around. Those 'damned' simultaneous incarnating spirits are an obstacle for the queen. Better to have the soul-less ones (minions). They obey. The 'wonders' of vampire life are glittering in the play. This also makes Lightsiders very nervous. Their 'god' has no real power over the vampires. In one scene, Professor Abronsius marvels at Krolock's library of \"every book ever published\". Abronsius wants to read them all. Krolock hints that body immortality is needed for that. Advanced incarnates know otherwise. That's a lie of the body oriented and a denial of the spirit. Great play...very different...very EndGame. Loads of observations to be made by those who see it and analyze it. I just read a couple reviews, by non-critics, who said the Germans, who originated Dance of the Vampires, complained that the Broadway version \"isn't Dark and sinister enough\". They even boycotted the opening. The German version is supposed to be more into producing fear in the audience rather than entertaining in the Broadway version. The German version, from what I've read, is truely VERY Dark on the Orion order. Embracing the Dark Polarity (Special Gold Edition Segment) Most Earthers are so propagandized by the Light polarity that unreasonable fears of the Dark polarity are extensive. The Dark encourages this fear as fear feeds the lower astral and makes Earthers far easier to control. I have written several times that Light and Dark feed each other. My comments on the Broadway play, Dance of the Vampires, appear in another segment. In watching various video clips from the play on their fan site (www.dotvfans.com). you can view how, in several instances during the play, that the Dark makes its case against the Light. Pay attention to the words that Count Krolock sings in \"Come With Me\". He encourages you to see the Dark apart from Light propaganda. \"Come with me and bless the MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Let the Darkness be your salvation. Curse the day, escape the Light. Break the chains of imagination.\" It IS necessary to embrace the Dark and the Light to reach Balance. The Light would have us believe that they are all ’good' and Dark is all 'bad'. This is not true at all. There is good and bad in both polarities. The count is correct in saying you must experience the night in order to appreciate it. The Dark saving you from the Light is the opposite side of the coin for the Light saving you from the Dark. As long as you adhere to one polarity above the other, you have not reached a major experiential goal for the 3rd density path. What one will eventually do is absorb the best of BOTH polarities. By blending them together you discover true Balance. Imagination IS severely limited by the Light polarity. The volume of'you can’t do/say' rules is a binding on your imagination. In order to break the bounds, you must use Dark techniques. If it makes you quake to know that, you are definitely not ready for Matrix V Gold Edition. This doesn't mean that Dark doesn't have its own propaganda. It definitely does. Dark is very body/3rd density oriented. The vampire/undead legends are all body centered. Count Krolock sings that if you follow him \"you will live forever more\" as a vampire. This is body orientation at the suppression of spirit and your true self. You already are immortal. Your physical body is meant to be only temporary. Yet Darksiders, such as the Orion queen, the undead of legends, etc, all crave an eternal physical body and stagnation of spiritual growth. This is the Dark's lure for the body oriented of the 3rd density. However in one song, \"Eternity\", the vampires complain about the eternal loop of physical existence with nothing new being a \"pain in the ass\". The spirit craves change. The body craves conformity (the youth industry as the ideal). This song demonstrates a spirit influence for a true undead would not say that. It's a caveat included in the music for those who can observe and note. The choice that the female lead has in the play is body over spirit. \"It feels good\" she says when the count bites her. \"It feels good\" Alfred says when she bites him. That's the body talking because once the person becomes a vampire, they are soul-less with no reflection (indicating the body exists without the previous soul while acting on past memories). You need to really examine Dark very well to see its many facets and traits. There are some very valuable ones that you must have to Advance. The Light has many facets as well, some of which you also need and many your don't. Both polarities use fear to control. Fear is the one element both polarities feature that you will learn to overcome. Here's a clue for you to consider: to reach Balance, you need an equal amount of both Light and Dark blended together. One other Dark propaganda I want to comment on is the idea of soul stealing. I had a Matrix 5 reader as a guest at my house last weekend. I showed him Arizona Wilder's video tape (excellent). In it she talks about how a reptilian was there when Diana was murdered and he 'looked into her eyes and stole her soul with her final breath'. It is a Dark technique to attempt to steal your soul (or parts of it) using a breathing technique. This involves the Darksider inhaling his/her breath over your mouth, many times while kissing you. I had this tried on me once in the mid-80's. At the time I didn't know what was going on since I was not familiar with the technique at the time. This man kissed me several times and each time he inhaled deeply. It did not have any effect on me other than raising a question mark MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 325"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"in my mind. He did not steal my soul. Since then I've been shaman trained and learned a lot. Your Higher Self will not allow someone to permanently steal your soul. This would mean that an incarnation has more power than a Higher Self which is pure fantasy. A Dark shaman could steal a part of a soul. The Higher Self would look on this as another experience. This is a temporary state. As a shaman, I’ve seen stolen soul pieces. Rest assured that all pieces will be returned to where they belong by the time your Final Incarnation summons all that Higher Selfs incarnations back within. One thing a shaman does for people is find lost soul pieces and return them to the owner. Few are deliberately taken. Most are lost through some hard event in your life. There are relatively few Dark shamans in the world, fortunately, and they tend to be quite gaudy in ceremonial garbs and smile way too much. There are also relatively few genuine shamans in the world and, unfortunately, too many wanna-be shamans who can only do you a disservice. Trust your Higher Self in these matters. The paranoid fear of Dark by Light attempts to erect a box that they trust your fear will keep you in. This is to perpetuate the continuity of polarity. I have heard that many Lightsiders up and left Dance of the Vampires once they saw the track of the story line. They didn't like having their fantasy bubble burst. I really enjoyed it and my observational skills were in high gear during and after it. Thanks, Count Krolock and company! Dance of the Vampires, although only briefly around dispensed very important information to those who were able to participate in that event. Observation: Light Polarity Attempts to Alter the Game Here's another example of polarity trying to change the Game. A faction of the Light polarity,'the emissary of light', calling themselves \"spiritual warriors\", plans to launch an attack on the world on February 9, 2003 as 'a great experiment'. They will attempt a technique of theirs to force change and control the will of people. Whether or not their website (emissaryoflight.com) will be there after Feb 9 remains to be seen. The Lightside loves to couch their controls is fluff and soothing tones. You will see plenty of that on their site. Their central figure is a crippled kid in Korea. Lightsiders just do fall all over children and, if they are handicapped, it really fuels their fantasies. You have all read enough in the Matrix 5 materials about Lightsiders to know when they are up and about mischief. The Korean kid has a \"vision\". Geez, don't all the polarities have 'visions' any more. Major Darksider Bush has his 'vision', new Republican Senate boss, Frist, has a 'vision'. All polarity king/queenpins seem to have 'visions'. Visions are also delusions that are given many times under the influence of drugs. The 'vision' of the Korean kid is to attack the Middle East on Feb 9 with massive amounts of psychic generated energies to force change. Forcing change is always the way of polarities. Conformity - it's for your benefit. Bullshit! The question is what energy is manipulating that kid? Lower astrals love possession tricks and it may well be that they are behind it. The lower astral knows that Lightsiders believe in the nonsense 'children of the blue ray' crap. That was a Darkside set up at the root anyway. This has also been covered elsewhere in Matrix 5. The key people for today are in the Baby Boomer generation born 1946-1965.

It is in the interest of the Game to have you look where it wants you to. Of course since the Lightsiders have announced this to the world (I found it announced on David Icke’s site and he is a Lightsider), the Darkside will be well prepared for it. The Darkside lives for these kinds of attacks and has the ability to follow the energy streams of these attacks to the people who generate them. It's all part of the Game's polaric mess. My advice is not to get involved in this battle except as an observer. I remember the Lightside attack on New Year’s Eve at midnight going into Jan 1, 2000. They directed attack energy to the great pyramid in Egypt. I observed how the Dark polarity was ready and eagerly accepting the challenge. The pyramid was a swirl of black energy in preparation for the attack. I stood far back watching this phenomenon. The polarities are all about force and conformity to their will whether it is because of \"I want it so (Dark)\" or \"It's for your benefit because I want it so (Light)”, it's all about obeying their will. Externally forced changes do not help a spirit to advance. Changes bringing advancement must come from the internal because of observation. Observation: Lightside Delusion & Allowance I saw this quote on a site: \"Infinite love is the only truth. Everything else is illusion.\" This is the Lightside's ultimate delusion. It is the core of their beLIEfs. As long as unconditional/unlimited/infinite (or whatever term is in vogue with them) love exists, the polarities will continue to thrive. Matrix 5 talks about polarity terms quite a bit. Now that we are in EndGame, the polarities will actually get more pronounced. As Darksider Bush gets more and more into empire building and threatening those who disagree with him, Lightsiders will get increasingly shrill with their 'unconditional love' loop. One feeds the other. The Light polarity is blinded by the Light. They are so blinded that they cannot see anything but the Light as they move to the edge of the cliff not seeing where they are going. Notice that both Dark and Light polarities stress that you are with them or against them. Adolph von Bush has been proclaiming that from his appointed seat in the White House, since September of 2001, for the Dark side. Champions of the Light have been trumpeting the opposite - ultimate love instead of ultimate domination. This is when you have to bend the line into a circle and see that they are just opposite ends of the same coin. They both see to dominate and manipulate. They both seek to control everyone else in one way or another. The Law of Allowance says one must allow another to develop as they desire. It is not a Law of Acceptance. Allowing does not mean you accept or agree. It does mean that others can progress as they desire as long as they don't force their will on others. The stance of polarities always excludes the Law of Allowance. However in EndGame we see many examples of varieties of expression that rubs society wrong. Sex (not gender) and sexual expressions, the great taboos of religion/society, are based in repression of Higher Self contact. Refer to other Matrix 5 segments for more on that. Those who complain and wail over gay/lesbian expression are mainly those who would identify themselves with the Light side and Light polarity religions.

All Rights Reserved. over by Dark polarity types and control fanatics of physical dominance who demand everyone should be like us, or as popular in America, like U.S. The polarities are so caught up in their agendas that Allowance is the last thing they would consider. Allowance oozes individuality. This should tell you where, the conformist blather of the polarities is rooted - the sequential aliens who are the control mavens of the galaxy. Earth, a wealthy planet, as the location for simultaneous incarnates just irritate the sequentials. The Game is allowing the challenges of gay/lesbian visibility to show those simultaneous incarnates, who are Advanced enough, how polarities operate. It also adds to one's observational notes and sharpens one's skills. The Game allows the sequentials to warp the simultaneous experience by moving to place females above males and cause a shift away from different incarnational experiences that the genders afforded in the past to the increasingly Orion model of today. The Light polarity will do whatever it wants because they are doing it \"for your benefit\". That's an outright lie. The old chestnut, \"If you love me you'll...(whatever)\" is pure control freakish. The Dark polarity will continue with One World mentalities. The Light seems to concentrate more on spiritual control/dominance. The Dark wants physical control/dominance. BOTH are dead ends by themselves, yet BOTH must be embraced by the 3rd density players in order to reach Balance. 2012 & Lightsiders I was in my favorite health food store the other day and the owner asked me for some general advice for the coming year. I told her that 03 was setting up as the 'year from hell' on a global scale (EndGame moves into high gear and final stages). Next she mentioned 2012. I told her that I expect most of us would be long dead by then. This shocked her. \"But isn't 2012 the year of a change in consciousness?\" Yes, a changed from 3rd density life to 4th density for most as your physical dies. Lightsiders, almost always fearing death in any form, know that 2012 is rapidly approaching. In order to calm their anxieties about that year, they've fluffed it up to be a 'change in consciousness'. This is PURE bullshit. Not only that, the impression they like to convey is that the world pretty much keeps going on as it is, then, on a magical day in 2012, suddenly everyone is all 'love & light' and Dark ceases to exist. FOOLS! They close their eyes to what has been going on for years, the fascist government in America continues to try and rule the world as wars are demanded by the rabid, appointed president-dictator Bush. Only a Lightsider could delude themselves into the 'change of consciousness' myth. This myth is right alongside with other major myths, such as jesus, female superiority, 'god', 'the government is here to help you' and 'space brothers'. The Game is fine with Lightsiders believing these things since this places then in the position of inaction and Dark can move ahead with its agenda. This belief actually allows the Dark a free hand because the Light says, \"it'll all change at once in 2012\". The Law of Allowance says everyone is free to do what they want, so it demands that the Lightsiders have the freedom to wallow in their myths. This is part of the experience pattern and, when they grow beyond their own limitations, they will realize where their errors were.

My advice to the store owner was to trust in her Higher Self and resist outside attempts to create and encourage fear. It is by fear that they will try to control the populace. In fear, people tend to give away their power. This fear is total body orientation and the body overriding the spirit. It is fear that strengthens body ID control. It is overcoming fear that strengthens spirit control over body. Choose wisely. 2012 Special Gold Edition Segment I remember when I first heard the buzz about the Mayan calendar ending at 2012, it will occur in December of 2012, that the end of Earth (as it has been) will occur. Depending on who you listen to, it can be anything from the planet blowing up to a change in consciousness. The Dark version would be that Earth will blow apart. They would like this because it would induce the most fear in people. The Light version is the 'change of consciousness’ thing because just about anything more threatening makes Lightsider knees knock and teeth chatter. I remember seeing in one of the Prophecy series (on television) that the common household appliances would come alive and attack people. The waffle iron would chase you around the room! Yeah, sure. At first it seemed that people wanted to hear just about any 2012 idea in the late 8o's because it was perceived as a year so distant. Now we are in 2003, less than 10 years until the date arrives. Lightsiders are starting to be more active with their version of 2012. I've recently read about someone saying that there are some indigenous people, in the area where the calendar was discovered, who say it won't be the destruction of the Earth, but a 'change in consciousness' IF certain Lightsider beliefs are adhered to. Of course when these people add that what they say is some Central American local's opinion, the Light version gains more followers. The attitude being ’if it's Native, it must be better’. When Atlantis was in its final days, there was a similar mood. The Lightsiders of that day preached a similar fable of 'change of consciousness'. Atlanteans still carried on like their routines would never end. Then the 'end' came and it arrived - literally. The Earth didn't end, but it was FAR from being the same. Atlantean civilization ceased to exist. This invited more alien involvement in numerous Earther sections. The Atlantian history is known in certain segments of Earth today, but these groups have no intention of allowing the general public to know what it is. Those 'live' pyramid room openings in Egypt that pop up now and then are strictly for show. They already know what will be shown in those \"live\" television broadcasts. You won't find any genuine surprises there. The pyramids were there when Atlantis existed and thrived. One thing you can count on is that Earth will not explode in 2012. Another guarantee in 2012 is that people will not suddenly stop being who they are to spout 'love and light' nonsense. Always dump both extreme polarities' bullshit. The Game is in full play and we are in the stage called EndGame. Just as your incarnations have their major experiences and deaths preset by your Higher Selves, so are the Earth’s set by the planetary Higher Self. The Wild Cards discussed in Matrix 5 refer to possibilities for this end, but it isn't for us to know exactly which one will bring the completion to the simultaneous incarnational path on Earth. When I traveled to 2200 for the Astral Travel course, I saw what Earth would look like. Gavin Frost told me that he knew that I had been there because I saw the same situation that all the thousands of people, who took the course and got to 2200, observed all over the globe. Now as to what Event happened to make Earth this way is what the Wild Card(s) to be played will determine.

Looking Forward — The Age of Aquarius In The Christ Conspiracy by Acharaya S. (a MUST read book), a good job was done on describing the past Ages of Taurus, Aries and, especially, Pisces and their influences on Earth. Pisces, the Age we just left a few years back, brought us the evils of Christianity and other one god religions, slavery, drug use, secret governments and such. The Age we are entering now is Aquarius. This wonderful age is one of spirituality, the antithesis of religion. We will have (Finally) the end of the Dark Christian and other one god religions, but they will not go gracefully. No Dark ever does! Aquarius will also bring about the end of the artificial-to-humans state of monogamy/marriage and the era of individual growth with a connection to the Higher Self not seen in, literally, Ages. None of this will come easily. A major catastrophe must occur and a severe reduction in Earther inhabitants as well. Val and I have discussed this on and off. Will the meteor that is supposed to hit either Italy or Morocco on Sept 21, 2001 be the EVENT? Maybe, but SOMETHING will occur pretty soon because 2012 is the year that should END the chaos, according to all known signs, and the Age of Aquarius move into full swing with the remaining Earth inhabitants. This means there will be no more minion incarnations on Earth, only Higher Self incarnations. What happens to the Orion DNA commands? That’s a great question and I really don't have the answer for it because that's an internal problem that could only be corrected by reconstructive DNA repairs. It WILL be corrected, the Orion Empire will be cut off from Earth, the drive for gender dominance will end, the need for credit/currency (ONLY in Orion Empire worlds) will no longer exist on Earth. Pretty much all we are familiar with today will cease as structure. You can see why the reduction in planetary occupancy by humans would have to be reduced to about 500,000. Signs and portents are invaluable but can be tricky to interpret at times. What can you do? The only thing you can really do is to educate yourself and connect to your Higher Self. Your Higher Self will ensure that you are where you are. If your destiny is to exit (die), you will, as this is something you chose BEFORE incarnating. If your destiny is to live through the Changes, you will as your Higher Self will see you are in the area(s) you need to be. No need to worry nor to think of all the angles. Trust in yourself, your Higher Self and you'll be just fine. The Age of Aquarius will be a marvel, once it has begun in full swing, like never before. Embrace the changes, roll with them...don't fight them and you will do just fine. 330"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit- The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Earth — Ending the Myths The current and long running belief is that there is Mother Earth and Mother Nature, female planet and female expressions of the planet alone. These are invalid. Earth is NOT female. It is both male AND female, as are all fertile planets. The Earth is the same as its ancient human residents were, male and female perfectly blended into one. I have written about Earth humans previously. The spirit that has Earth as its body (as we have our physical bodies) is a brilliant, opalescent energy being. Its size compares to our own spirits' sizes. It is highly intelligent, has the full range of emotions and is learning/experiencing by its interaction with those beings on and under the surface, regardless of species or planet of origin. The path these beings follow is different than our own, but just as valid. Sedona's red rocks are an example of Earth's female nature. The fertile exterior is an example of the Earth's male nature. Dead planets are those where the animating spirit has departed. These have no atmospheres and no life. There is still an essence, however, as all matter has a form of eternal essence. Forming planets will have one of these spirits, like that of Earth, once an atmosphere is in place. The atmosphere indicates a spirit within, unless the atmosphere is artificially constructed. This mirrors life on Earth beginning with the baby's first breath. The first breath signifies the spirit has entered the body. The planetary atmosphere indicates the spirit has entered the planet. Those who deal with deities and the planetary spirit are in error. 'Calling down the goddess or god' does not summon the Earth spirit, nor the lunar one (there is no spirit in the Moon as it is an artificial construction around a dead planetoid). The Earth spirit is not at the beck and call of beings on the planet. Since these deities are really non-existent, these people can only summon energy constructs that they created on the astral and put energy into. The true origin of the 'goddess' is the Orion reptilian queen and any of her female representatives or genetic scientists. The origin of the 'god' is the Sirian wolfish king and any of his male representatives or genetic scientists. In this relationship, Orion's will supercedes Sirius'. These are responsible for the mutating into genders what was once a single, whole Earth human. All of that is another, previously discussed topic. Montana Crop Formation The Orion Empire, ages ago, adopted a Sirian major weapon. This was to produce a craft that looked like an asteroid, but was actually a planet destroyer in disguise. At one time LONG ago, there was one in orbit around Earth. It was called, by the Earthers, the Eye of God due to it's roundish shape and prime weapon port in the center, which from Earth's surface, looked like an eye. The weapon port can be disguised as well to look like part of the asteroid or small moon. The Star Wars movies had the Death Star. This was based on the Orion/Sirius craft except it was metallic looking instead of disguised. It was one of these that blew apart the planet we now call the asteroid belt. It takes just one blast to destroy a planet. As I wrote of in the Wild Card possibilities, the Andromedan Council is said, by Alex Collier, to be moving to intervene on Earth. They are on their way now. If the Orion Empire feels it will lose Earth and our solar system to the Council, it plans not to allow it to happen.

Just as on Earth, when an army in defeat must retreat, they blow up bridges and railroads and kill the livestock, etc so the Montana crop formation (summer 2000) shows 3 Orion Death Stars (circles with weapon ports open) firing on Earth. One Death Star caused the asteroid belt. 3 will leave nothing but dust. If this is carried out, death will be instantaneous for the entire planet. The attitude is, as with Earth's retreating armies, 'if we can't have it neither can you'. The crop formation gives that warning. This doesn't mean that Orion will actually succeed with it, but it does reveal their plan in case they lose our planet. Observation: Signs I just saw the new film, Signs, with Mel Gibson, Before you read further, this segment will include parts of the film, so you may prefer reading it after you have seen the movie. What occurs in Signs is a partially potential with the alien wild card scenario. The alien language you hear is insectoid. The aliens you see are a reptilian variety noticed by the claws and height. The actions by the alien in the central family's house near the end are more like Greys and definitely not reptilian. Reptilians would NEVER stand still for what happens at the end. What Disney has done is create their own hybrid alien. I do believe the general public could not handle a true Orion reptilian in the context of the film if it was done as they really are, however in Signs the aliens are not defeated as they were in Independence Day. Both films have an base theme of hostile aliens wanting to harvest the Earth, although in Signs it's harvesting the Earthers (must taste like chicken to them). Earthers have been fed the superiority lie for so long that when faced with the reality of the overwhelming superiority (technological) of alien empires, they either panic or hide their heads. Movie makers know this and therefore greatly soften the blows given in almost all alien invasion pictures. Too bad. Earthers could do with a severe dose of reality. This is not a gory film and several scenes are left to your imagination. This is more like a 50's style invasion with 3o’s/4o's suspense. It's very well done. Unfortunately 'god' has a sub-theme in Signs. The writer desperately wants you to run to your local external deity for salvation. Matrix 5 readers know that won't get you anywhere, but it still is an oppressive curse of society in most of the world. The ’god' stuff was weak for me, especially the end, although I know where the writer is going with that and how he wants to lull the viewers back to the mythological sleep induced by that non-existent being. Disney is behind the release of Signs. Disney has been heavily involved with the government since Walt became a government agent and there are numerous references to that in print. About 10 years ago, Disney made a 1 hour television special about aliens to coincide with the opening of Tomorrow Land's Alien Encounter. Only the last few minutes of the show dealt with Alien Encounter. The rest of the show explained real aliens and many facets connected with them. What was especially interesting was that the narrator didn't use words like \"may\" or \"could be\". He used words like \"is\" and \"are\". One would think the whole planet already knew what they did. Unfortunately, they only broadcast that show once. Lucky for me, it was at a strange time and I had taped it. Now Disney is involved in producing Signs. With 2003 set to be the 'year from hell' due to several HEAVY astrological placements, I would not be surprised that the alien wild card 332"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"finally gets played. However we won't find that the aliens come, harvest their load of humans and then depart. If the Orion Empire has its way, they'll be here to stay and Earth will be an overt part of the Orion Empire. On NBC evening news yesterday (8/2/02), a White House spokesman said that the next war on Iraq is planned for April of 03 and \"it'll be like any other war ever seen\". THAT should catch people's attention. Will alien technology play a part? Are there some alien toys the military wants to experiment on the Iraqis with? Time will tell. I do recommend seeing Signs. Use your observational skills and see what YOU can glean from the film. There is a lot to sort through, although forget that tossing water on them acts like it did to the Wicked Witch in The Wizard ofOz. It doesn't work that way, but it is there to make Earthers feel a bit more at ease.

Coup on Mintaka A reliable source told me that he was told, during sleep, by a type of mottled Grey alien, that there had been a coup on Mintaka (home system of the Orion Empire) and the ancient queen was killed and has been replaced by a new queen. The former queen favored covert control of Earth. The new insists on overt control of Earth, complete with \"knocking down of buildings and enslavement of the planet\". This isn't something that just happened last year, but several years ago. The rise of a new queen is probably behind the crop circles with the Death Stars (orbs with circle in their centers) and another showing the inner planets of our solar system but no Earth depicted in orbit. The last time there was a coup in the Orion Empire was when the females deposed the king and killed his supporters. This happened back before they discovered Earth. My friend was told that the new queen devoured the old, as is their way. Observations on the Animal Plagues Mad Cow disease began in England. Now Hoof & Mouth disease's breakout also began in England and is rapidly spreading across Europe, the Middle East and now South America. What's up? England is the center of the Orion rebel queen's power on Earth. Are agents of the returning true Orion queen at work here? The Orion Empire intends to make Earth an overt member of the Empire. The Empire is returning. The rebel queen will be dealt with. The Empire is not pleased with the development of humans on Earth, not the minion incarnations, but the Higher Self incarnations. The breaking down of Orion DNA command structures and the Higher Selves entering into consciousness with their human incarnations are major concerns. Loss of slave labor, loss of food supply and more are at stake. IF HIGHER SELVES NEVER CHOSE THE EARTH INCARNATIONAL PATH, THE DNA BREAKDOWNS WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN OCCURING! It is the Higher Selves that are, in fact, causing the end of Orion domination on Earth. As I've said before, one serious option Orion is considering is removing ALL humans from Earth and replacing them with newly created beings with safeguards preventing another DNA deterioration. One way to consider is that Orion queen agents employ germ warfare 333"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"against the Earthers' food supply. That both started in England, seat of the rebel queen's power on Earth, is no coincidence. If you think so, you should not be reading this material. The huge object entering our system, reported by those using infrared telescopes, from the direction of the Orion system says much. Time will tell, but do consider these observations. Planetary events are speeding up as we move closer to the end of 2012 and whatever that will bring. Being able to observe and detect details is essential for spiritual maturity and definitely for a Final Incarnation. Keep observing. Wild Cards Earth is currently at a critical juncture. The direction that will be followed depends on several 'wild card' events. Wild cards are those events that are not predictable as to WHICH will occur. Depending on which one or which several, events brought on by their playing will take place. I will touch on 3 of the major wild cards. 1-The Orion card. This involves the intended return of overt rule over Earth by the Orion Empire. All pretext of 'human rule' will be done away with. If you get a chance, watch the Simpson's episode of Kodos vs. Kang where Earthers are turned into slaves, etc. One of Orion's options under serious consideration is the eradication of the current human population to be replaced with a new type of being without the Orion perceived 'flaws'. If the Eye of God, the ship also known as the Death Star (similar to as in Star Wars) shows up visible in our sky, the Orion card is being played. 2-The Andromedan Council card. This involves the removal of the repressive alien presence on Earth and Earth's artificial Moon which is loaded with alien involvement. This brings the totality of the Andromedan Council to bear on the situation here and removes Earth from Orion control. This will bring much radical change to Earth including the end of rule by money and credit, which are part of the Orion subjugation system. If this card is played and you live for money, credit and stocks, you better catch a departing ship for the Orion system. This card will reveal the aliens operating on Earth so all can see. This would be a most interesting card to play. 3-The Earth Changes card, this involves massive natural disasters that will forever change the face of the planet. Look at Gordon Scallion's maps to see. One way or another, Earth will have its Balance returned. What also makes it interesting is that the situation does not have to be limited to a single wild card play. No matter what card(s)is played, Earth will NEVER be the same again. If you are a Final, Dominant or VERY advanced incarnation, you will revel in what is coming, no matter which card(s)is played. If you are not one of these incarnations, this will be a tremendous learning experience. The body centric and controlled will be weeping and wailing and I won't even go into the minion reaction.

That’s why the reptilians put 'breed like roaches' into human DNA, because they'd need them at this time. As they are a Dark-side manipulation, Dark is counting on their animalistic reactions to the changes to create further chaos and, therefore, more fear for their 4th density relatives to feed off of In future Earth, there are relatively few beings. It will be close to how it was when the Orion Empire arrived for the gender splitting in Ancient times. Just as they knew to artificially create a calendar to say ‘next year is 2000’ based on what they knew to be coming, so they also knew they needed X amount of minions incarnated. The idealistic Earth can only be possible once the minions are removed, for they were not meant to be in human form. They were meant as fodder/distractions. Earth will assist in doing its part in trying to restore balance by earth changes that have occurred, and will continue to, rid the planet of minions. True, non-minions are also being removed by earth changes, but Higher Selves look on this as another experience. To really stop minion incarnation, breeding must be severely controlled and the population reduced. Paying them to breed (welfare) is reptilian cloaked in faux compassion. It is in the reptilian interest to step up the breeding. Those in power want to increase breeding, but want certain \"undesirables\" removed, especially blacks, hence the current eradication programs in Africa. Yet, the reptilian controlled religions in the West call abortion 'murder'. They want more 'acceptable' races bred. Wishing for “everything to be perfect” is one thing. People who do so also need to realize what is involved in making everything perfect. Many humans must transit. Once the transition is completed, THEN the group soul can be used to create animal/bird/fish, in a clean environment, in plenty. That's the purpose of the group soul - nature. They are supposed to develop differently in accordance with their own purpose. Some Commentary on Handbook II-39 Among other things, Handbook II-39 states: “The desire to 'rescue the suffering’ will be great and examples of victims will be within victim consciousness. The observer mode of allowance, while the new paradigm focus manifests and brings the ultimate solution to their plight, must be held securely at the forefront of the conscious awareness. If dropped, it must be quickly picked up. Looking at or recalling a meaningful symbol is the easiest way to regain the focus. Will all who resonate and commit be able to retain their focus? The success of the project will depend on the consistent and the persistent. Each must look within themselves to determine if their evolvement and genetic adaptation is such that a commitment of this magnitude is possible, plausible and noble enough to find out if the traits of character necessary are available or not. It is certain that each one that commits will find out!” What that means (you gotta read both Handbooks') is that the Dark side will parade victims in front of us (Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, etc) to ‘tug on the heart strings’ of the Light side.

You have to not participate in the ‘we gotta do something’ attitude, as this participation is counted on by the DARK side. Dark side blows up a building in Oklahoma and right away power is given away to ‘do’ something. Those who will survive the chaos will stiffen their resolve. Remember from 6.2 billion to 500 million means a LOT of people will be recycling into the astral AND YOU HAVE TO LET THEM GO! As I’ve said before, if you understand death, you have no problem with this. In order to succeed with the New Reality, you have to say ‘no’ to victims. They don’t want to be helped out of viciimhood, but want to be sympathized with. If you can’t be strong enough, you will become one of them. Unfortunately, although I hope otherwise, I don’t think everyone I’m sending these things to will pass the tests. For them, there’s reincarnation. If you pass the tests, it’s because you’ve reclaimed your power and became an OBSERVER of the chaos in order to help bring in the New Reality. The Observer Mode The observer mode, in the sense of spiritual progression, comes in stages starting with very Advanced and Dominant incarnations and reaches its Earth 3rd density climax in the Final Incarnation. The novice, as well as developed, observer mode is a ‘people observer’ first. To others, people observing is purely a curiosity of human activity, but that’s only the surface appearance. What is more critical is the Higher Self is trying to communicate with the incarnated part of shimself. The Higher Self wants the incarnation to notice the 7 nechanics and the postures of the Game. Observe the awakened Orion DNA manipulations, especially in the female and the growing subservience of the male, etc. This energy originates from the awakened Final Incarnation and passes to shim’s Dominant and very Advanced incarnations. Remember, Higher Self incarnations on Earth are simultaneous. I realize it may be a difficult concept to grasp, so just push it to the side, for now, if it mystifies you. It has been tremendously helpful and of great assistance that the Handbook for the New Paradigm volumes are available at this time. They have greatly assisted those incarnations who have read them and contain the 4 Laws of the Universe. Of the 4 laws, the first 2 are especially important in advancing in observer status - Like Attracts Like and The Law of Allowance. [Ed: see the section at the end of the book for a review of these principles.] It’s very synchronistic that 1 had just spoken to Val about writing this piece when he received the new 4-section addition to the Handbook, which deals with being an observer, among other things. Section 2 of 4 in the new material gives the difference, in terms, between watcher and observer. The watcher is passive. The watcher is only indulging his/her curiosities but has no intention of becoming aware. The observer intends to use the knowledge to become aware and develop. The observer strives to spiral out of the Game. The watcher desires to play the Game. The watcher can also intend on using the materials gathered from watching to further control other Earth humans. You don’t become a full observer over night, although once ready, spiritually, you progress rapidly. Being an observer is an active role. You receive important knowledge and then you apply what you learn to your life. For example, you apply the 4 Laws of the Universe to your private life. Let others do what they will, but the observer is eager to spiral out. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

As I’ve mentioned before, this can be a lonely path unless you are fortunate to connect with another observer. The keen observer, as stated in #2 of 4, is cognizant of the scene and his/her place in it. The observer also knows how the new knowledge differs from the Games rules and sees how his/her reality has changed and continues to change. This is an important part of the spiral out. The observer does not submit to the Game’s peer pressures. The observer has adjusted his/her life to fit the spirit’s control over the body. This is the rocky road, as per one of my earlier pieces. Once you have accepted one \"logical statement\", as #2 of 4 says, into your belief system, you have begun the total realignment of your belief systems. Knowledge trumps belief since belief, which is a Neptunian deception, is not necessarily based on fact and always contains control systems of the Game. As you realize what is true, your entire viewpoint can change. Observers share what they discover with others, but will never force this knowledge. If an observer shares something, and the interest is rejected by the other person, you change the subject. A seed has been planted; so let nature take its course. Those who 'go with the flow', as #2 of 4 warns, take the path of least resistance. This is the smooth path I warned of. Those who go with the flow are adding to the momentum of planetary enslavement. The chaos period is almost here and could kick in full swing at any time. Observers will handle this far differently than watcher, common or minion incarnations. This piece should give those who read it much to consider. One’s Fun Side You have to be complete to enter the higher realms. One of the essential elements of completeness is a sense of humor and an ability to have fun. When I told someone on Saturday that I was putting up my tree with the train around the bottom on Sunday, he said, \"If I were living alone, I wouldn't do that because Christmas is for kids.\" How sad! He let the child/fun side in him die! There's no grim, stodgy types in the Higher (Above 5th density) Realms. I got carded (Yes!) in Las Vegas at Quark's. She really made my day when she told me she'd have to see my ID before she'd sell me a Romulan Ale. I was having fun with the Klingons and the Ferengi, letting the fun side of me enjoy itself. You MUST do this. There are some of you who are always so serious and I rarely, if ever, hear laugh. How sad! You’re “following the Dark side plan”, even if you didn't realize it. What happens to the fun side of people? In my own observations, it is almost always lost when the person marries the opposite gender. Fun men become dronish when the female starts ’changing' him. Fun females become drudges when the male wants her to be a 'traditional' wife. Opposites do NOT attract in anything but magnets. In all other areas, opposition is trouble. In astrology, it is a separating aspect of friction, for example. Oil and water don't mix. Like attracts like in human fields. Heterosexual couplings are learned behaviors, not natural. Men belong with men and women with women. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

They only grudgingly get together afterwards 'because society (read Dark side) expects it. I told myself I'd never take on an apprentice who was burdened with a woman. She ALWAYS gets in the way. Understanding the energies, I know I could only seriously teach another male - compatible energies. Every time I've tried to teach one burdened with a female, there was interference, bitchiness, etc. And in all cases, the female came into the picture (as if sent by the Christian devil) AFTER I started working with the man. Needless to say, these poor, unfortunate males have ceased learning while their succubae drain them. But that's another story. Of big importance, though, is don't lose vour fun side. If you have (and some of you have) one, you must find it and let it out! Get that whoopee cushion, water pistol or rattlesnake egg envelope. Laugh. Have fun. If I find someone who can have fun, I try to bring it out of them. But you who are always so serious (and you know who I mean), geez you can put me to sleep being so serious ALL the time. Even with the serious stuff, you can put a fun twist on it. Make fun of death. Make fun of everything, because none of that matters when you KNOW what the other dimensions hold. Laughing In the Handbook II, I just got done reading IT-27: \"The more playful the attitude and the greater the sense of humor that is brought into the process, the easier the passage through becomes. Indeed, those who have trod the path before you laugh well and frequently. Try it, you will like it.\" If you haven't gotten to the point that NOTHING is sacred and EVERYTHING can be looked at humorously, you have work to do on yourself. A couple of you are working towards that point and some of you are stuck in the somber and serious mode which won't do at all if you want to progress (you know who you are). If there is ANY sacred cow for you, you have room to improve. SOME of the current sacred cows: death, women, religious icons, perceived minorities, and victims. I can't stress enough that you have to see beyond the game and look from the eternal. Things taken as so damned serious are really not at all, however, you won't be able to recognize it until you become an observer rather than a player. Consider the words of the Handbook. As you allow changes to take hold within you, you'll get to know what I mean. Free Will & Choice-Comments on Handbook #27 In Handbook for the New Paradigm, section 27, it says, \"Again we remind you that free will allows those who choose to remain in the pattern of present existence [to do so]. DO NOT BE CONCERNED WITH THOSE.\" \"One is concerned with the choosing of his/her own experience and is not responsible for the experience of others.\" \"However choosing not to participate does have its consequences. Those who choose deliberately to withhold their participation in ending the present paradigm will be allowed to continue it elsewhere in a somewhat different format.\" [Ed.- discussion follows on next page] MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

As stated in my materials, these are my experiences and what I've seen. You are free to believe any you choose or none at all. That won't change what I've experienced. However, if you can resonate with any of the material, you need to do more than just agree intellectually. You must adapt what you believe into your life. I know of some who've said to me that they agree with what has been written, but just can't make changes in their lives as that would upset others. This indicates the spirit is not mature enough to override the body. This type of spirit still seeks approval from others (mid range level) Of course we must still earn a living and pay taxes (at least for now), but breeding and.marriage are 2 areas that you don't HAVE to participate in. If you want to live with someone, do so, but marriage is for society and for the alien masters. That's why people get congratulated for marrying and breeding - the Empire approves. What do you get for living with someone? Nothing and you hear things like, 'why don't you get married?’ Read instead, 'why don't you conform?' This goes for both het and gay marriages. A domestic partnership should be the most that would be needed. As the Handbook states, if you choose not to change your life, you will continue to live it elsewhere, while those who DO change their personal lives will move on to higher matters. People need to stop worrying what everyone else will say/do/think. Awakened Final Incarnations know this. The Game on Earth will be changing rapidly and forever VERY soon. Be sure you're on the right side of the fence for your progression. Whichever YOU choose, choose well and be happy with your choice for you can't have it both ways. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition The TRUE First Commandment We all know that little ditty known as the First Commandment - I am the lord, thy god. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. As I have said in earlier writings, religion is all about control, conformity and keeping people from knowing who they really are. The responsibility for this command began back when Ancient Earthers were split into genders by the Orion Empire. \"Remember, we are your gods. You will worship no others as gods except us.\" With all their dazzling technology and abilities due to this technology, the genderized humans obeyed the new party line. The loyalty to an external deity began at that time and has continues to this day. The Orion/Sirian Empires instilled this external deity concept and saw that the genetic codes reinforced it. The alien group, that became the god of the Middle Eastern desert tribes, codified the command as the first commandment of ten. This alien control freak became the god of the jews and the muslims by design and the Christians in a second hand way. Remember, the knee-benders are warned: worship me and only me for I am your god (optional thunder and lightning in the background for optimum drama). This false statement is reinforced by the recurring phrase of \"I’m only human\". You cannot be more than you recognize yourself to be. Keep this in mind. When I hear that phrase, I respond with: too bad for you because I'm not 'only human'. Yes, there IS an immortal, omnipotent being who you should defer to at all times. This being's concern for you (24 hours EVERY day) is above all others. This eternal entity is ever vigilant of what you do, permanently records all events in your life and will never abandon you. This being is none other than your Higher Self. 339 I"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

This is one of the major cover-ups of Earther history. When, riot if, you awaken to discover who you are, nothing and no one can ever cause you to fear or give away your power again. This major revelation, the True First Commandment, should be given very careful consideration by each incarnation having a Higher Self. Reclaim your power from all false, external gods of religions and sciences. Remember: YOU are your own god and must have no other gods before YOU. Brief Looks - ‘Andromedan Council’ & Atlantis The ‘Andromedan Council’ was back in the 'news' in June 2001 due to activity with Alex Collier and his reports on the Nibiru and the Council. The ‘Andromedan Council’ is to this sector of the galaxy as the United Nations is to Earth. Just as with the UN, you have all kinds of members, so to in the Andromedan Council will you find all types of aliens, both good and bad. Just as the UN is viewed with suspicion by many, so should the Andromedan Council’ be also examined. Collier's recent (June 01) comments that the majority of the Council will do nothing in regard to Earth and conflicting claims by different alien groups should cause you to read between the lines. As I've said before, the predominant polarity of this sector of the galaxy is Dark, thus you only have a handful of alien systems that seem to have noble intent in regard to Earth, such as the Tau Ceti, certain Pleiadian systems and the Zenetae. With the others you find the Orion/Sirian Empires who have made strong cases for control of Earth in the Council. Enter now Nibiru, another Dark group that looks on Israel as their property. The Nibiru do NOT have Earth's best interests in mind. Now we must bear one thing in mind, the Andromedans have a zero percent rating in doing what they say they will. Remember the great fly over of alien ships that didn't happen? That's just one. Keeping that in mind I'll say IF they show up, keep your defenses up and be cautious. Remember in the series Earth Final Conflict, the Taelons came saying they were friends but had alternative plans in mind. There's a LOT of fluff and flack connected to this Andromedan Council’. The proof is in action, NOT talk. As I've said before, ALL aliens have an agenda in dealing with Earth. Don't be put off by hearing the lofty sounding ‘Andromedan Council’ being mentioned by aliens. Atlantis Atlantis in getting press primarily due to Disney's animated film of the same name. Notice the prominent inverted capital 'V'. This also appeared in the old movie 'Atlantis the Lost Continent'. The inverted 'V' is the symbol of ancient Atlantis. The, DID have very advanced science, air ships and beam weaponry. The crystal was centraPto their energy, but not because of the crystal itself, but rather that the crystal amplified the energy attached to it. This is why quartz crystals are so valued by those who use their psychic abilities. The Atlantean prime power crystal had much power. Unfortunately, Atlantis was of Dark polarity at the end, unlike what the Disney movie would like people to believe. Atlantis also 340"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"dealt with several alien races and was involved in the war culminating in the destruction of the planet that now forms the asteroid belt in Earth's solar system. There is MUCH more known about Atlantis by segments of the American and British secret government controllers than one might imagine. Just as there is MUCH ancient Earth information that they'd never release. Remember, polarity is all about control and subjugation...POWER. Knowledge is power, the phrase goes, and they have no intention of sharing the knowledge they have. If they did, you would likely know more of who you really are and THAT runs contrary to the enslavement policies of the rulers of the planet. This is why it is SO important that each of you gains the knowledge of who you REALLY are and proceed accordingly, not to change the Game, but to spiral out of it. Information on Atlantis and the Andromedan Council is very interesting, especially the Andromedan Council since that is current in out time stream. However, I caution you to not get so wrapped up in these topics that you forget your main purpose for being here - to discover who you really are. Atlantis & Crystals Atlantis met its final destruction because of their Dark uses of crystal energies. Crystals and gemstones are considered the bones of the Earth Spirit's physical incarnation. These stones, provided they are still living (not pierced with metal), can be tapped into, by those who know, to use the Earth Spirit's abilities connected to the stone/crystal concerned. Quartz crystals amplify any energy placed next to it, for example. The Atlantean prime power crystal was primarily quartz. The Earth planetary spirit is very aware of who uses shim's 'bones' for what purposes and has no problem with those who use them for positive intents, such as healing and personal development. What the Atlanteans tried to do was harness the entire planet's structure with the prime crystal. This, in effect, would have bound the Earth planetary spirit to serve the Dark polarity in Atlantis. The Atlantean prime power crystal, you can imagine, had tremendous power. They had found a way to harness the energy of Earth's planetary spirit for Dark designs. This did not sit well with the planetary spirit, who is a spirit of Balance, and shim eventually said 'enough is enough' and caused the destruction of Atlantis through their prime crystal. The Atlanteans underestimated both the power of the planetary spirit and overestimated their perceived abilities to control the planetary nature spirit. The destruction of Atlantis, at this stage, was quick and complete, so enraged was the Earth planetary spirit of how they tried to cage shim. That the planetary spirit took this drastic action shows how out of control the Atlanteans had become. They went beyond working with crystals in a positive manner to using them for the Darkest intents. The planetary rulers, through certain agencies, have been searching for this prime power crystal with the intent of using it as the Atlanteans tried. It is unlikely that it will be found as the Earth spirit reclaimed in in the destruction of Atlantis.

Observation: Atlantean Experiments Revived This appeared on Oct 22,02 in CNN's website: \"WASHINGTON (AP) — By manipulating swine sperm, Italian researchers have made a strain of pigs that carry human genes in their hearts, livers and kidneys, an advance that could lead to creating herds of pigs that could provide organs for transplanting into humans.\" This is a revival of experiments that Atlantis was heavily involved in. It was the Atlanteans that created pigs using human genes and cats using reptilian genes. This creation of pigs, using human genes, is why the ban on eating pigs exists in certain religions. Eating pork was considered a form of cannibalism. Earth is returning to a variation of the late-Atlantean period when it was about to be destroyed. Heavy genetic experiments, under alien guidance, was a drive for Atlantean science. Extending life to equal the life spans of simultaneous incarnates was one goal as another was to be like the sequential incarnates. When Atlanteans became so body ID oriented that they fell under the spell of the sequential aliens, they signaled their end as a civilization on Earth. The sequential aliens were attempting to circumvent the vibrations of the future and of simultaneous path Higher Selves. This was outside the limitations of the Game. Earth is meant as the simultaneous path planet in the 3rd density of this galaxy. When the violation of this concept, by over manipulation by sequential aliens, the Atlanteans were destroyed and life had to begin the cycle again and Earth reverted to a state for simultaneous incarnates. The aliens sought to eliminate the vibrations of, from today's perspective, was the last 10,000 years. Atlantis was the last time that the sequential incarnates moved against the simultaneous incarnated in such a heavy handed manner. We are now repeating that cycle. Metaphors From The Wizard of Oz The 1939 film, The Wizard of Oz, contains several excellent examples of Dark and Light polarities, Balance and the Higher Self. The Dark polarity mind control in the U.S. relies heavily on Wizard of Oz themes (read Cathy O'Brien's 'Trance-Formation of America' for numerous examples). I have mentioned the Wizard of Oz in other material in Matrix 5, but will expand on it here and give you an important, totally new way to look at the movie. Three of the main characters are Dorothy, the Wicked Witch and the Witch of the North, Glinda. It is obvious that the Wicked Witch is the dark character. However, the Light character is Dorothy, NOT Glinda. Dorothy is a perfect Lightsider character. She calls herself \"the small and meek\" but is anything but meek. It is Dorothy who the Wicked Witch (in Dark black) battles with, NOT Glinda. Glinda, in the position of Balance, tells the Wicked Witch in Munchkin Land, \"Begone you have no power here.\" True - polarities have NO power over Balance, but the Wicked Witch knows she can zap Dorothy ONCE Balance has departed. \"True, I can't tend to you now..\", she tells Dorothy under Balance's direct protection. 342"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Glinda never refers to herself as the 'Good Witch', only the Witch of the North. I suggest to you that Glinda represents the Higher Self. How does she arrive? As a globe of energy that transforms into Glinda. The reverse occurs when she leaves where we see Glinda absorbed into the globe of energy. The energy globe represents your Higher Self (Dorothy's in this case) and Glinda is the image the Higher Self chooses to communicate, as a guide, with shim's incarnation, Dorothy. I would suggest that Glinda represents a Dominant Incarnation. At another part of the film, Dark attempts to halt the Higher Selfs Plan for the incarnation by putting a spell on the poppies thus causing Dorothy to fall under a deep, paralyzing sleep. This is a major, unacceptable interference in the Higher Selfs Plan for the incarnation. As the Higher Self (in ALL cases) will not allow any permanent derailing in the Plan shim has chosen, the Higher Self intervenes to stop Dark, in this case, by sending snow to disrupt the Dark spell and allow the incarnation (Dorothy) to proceed. Remember, Dark does NOT see those protected in gold light, so the Wicked Witch can only say, \"someone keeps helping her\", but apparently has no clue as to whom. The Dark Witch is unable to know that Glinda (Balance and the Higher Self) is acting on Dorothy’s behalf even after the events in Munchkin Land. Note that Dark still makes life quite miserable for Lightsider Dorothy. These are necessary experiences for Dorothy's growth and the Higher Self knows that the incarantion can overcome them and grow from them. Finally, when Dorothy has advanced enough in experience and maturity, Glinda tells her how to go home. Glinda says, \"You've always had the power to go home.\" We are always connected to our Higher Selves from first through Final incarnations. When asked why Glinda didn’t tell her back in Munchkin Land, how to return home, Glinda responds that \"she wouldn’t have believed me.\" This is true. This compares to the progress of an incarnation. Since all incarnations on Earth are simultaneous, the Higher Self (Glinda) has vast amounts of knowledge that shim will not give an incarnation until the incarnation is ready to receive it. BUT the Higher Self CONTINUALLY watches over ALL shim's incarnations to ensure that shim's Plan is not interfered with. Dorothy clicks her heels 3 times, says the words and Glinda circles her wand behind Dorothy’s head. The circling wand (clockwise) represents the transfer of knowledge from the Higher Self to shim's incarnation. \"There's no place like home\" also has another interpretation other than dreary black & white Kansas. Consider that 'home' refers to the Higher Self, the REAL you and where you return to after each of your incarnations, your incarnations’ true 'home'. There is NO place like home. Now, when you watch The Wizard of Oz, you can look at it very differently. There is more that can be drawn from the film, but that's up to you to discover.

In Matrix 5, I wrote about the 193 Q version of The Wizard of Oz and interpreted sections of it to the Game. Frank Baum wrote his child's story, The Wizard of Oz, over 100 years ago. It's amazing that that book would spin into several versions and visual interpretations. What is behind The Wizard of Oz ? More than one Higher Self as it evolved into these 2 major films. There is so much hidden in this story that even the Dark polarity has used and warped it to serve them with the sex slavery based in the US (read Cathy O'Brien's book Trance Formation of America. The keys and examples, primarily woven in the 1939 and 1978 versions, are waiting for Very Advanced and Final Incarnations to discover. In my 1939 interpretation (partial) was to set those incarnate interested to uncover more, if so moved. Now to give you some observations from the 1978 version as well. The Wiz is more sophisticated with its lessons. Ease on down the road - The road is your individual Path. Yellow bricks are chosen as yellow is the color of the mind and mental activity. Using your 'yellow brick road' is when you start going within to find your way. Along the way, Dorothy (the Unawakened Final Incarnation) meets her 3 Dominant incarnations: Scarecrow, Tin Man & Lion. They all are parts of Dorothy. Note that in the early part of the film, Glinda (reflecting Balance in the 1939 version) is representative of a Higher Self in this version. Glinda caught Dorothy in the snow tornado and took her WITHIN herself (OZ) to discover her Path and reach Awakened status. Note: the 2 versions present some different and some similar lessons, but you must discover them. Going down the yellow brick road, besides Dorothy meeting her 3 Dominant Incarnations, she also meets her other incarnations in the form of the Munchkins, Winkies and Emerald City inhabitants. The Emerald City inhabitants are pure mid levels. Everything centers around their deity, the Wiz (the Game). Whatever the Wiz dictates, the sheep follow. Colors of the moment are used in this film for whims of deity and conforming to society. The Winkies, at first, are slaves to the Wicked Witch (another facet of the Game) and work in her 'sweat shop'. Eventually Dorothy, while beginning to Awaken is not yet fully so, frees these incarnations by flushing Evillene down the toilet. This refers to eliminating the Game's controls over your life. Once the witch is dead, A Brand New Day is the peppy song of freedom. What are they free of? The Game. Once they realize they're free, they remove their ugly exteriors (incarnational bodies), they see their true selves and rejoice in who they really are - \"Can you feel a brand new day?!\" Dorothy and the 3 Dominants wind up back in Oz ,catch the wizard sleeping and discover the Wiz is a phony. A significant departure from the 1939 version, the 1978 version does not have the Wiz giving anything to anyone blit is rather a totally pathetic character. Dorothy is the one who gives the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion what they search for by teaching them to go within themselves. Now as the Awakened Final example, she's able to surpass her 3 Dominants and assist them. Dorothy says 'what you seek is within you' and 'you never needed someone else to give to you what you already have'. The Wiz asks if Dorothy can help him too. Her advice to him (and to all those who are playing the Game and want to escape) is 'you'll never find out what's within yourself as long as you stay within the safety of this room'. In other words, you'll never find out what is MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Believe in yourself is the main theme at this point. Glinda, who has been watching all along and is described by the Wiz as having 'great powers' finally makes herself known to Dorothy thus completing the Awakening process. Dorothy want to return 'home'. Home is actually WITHIN your Higher Self. Lena Horne sings Believe In Yourself as a reprise to Dorothy after she sang it to the 3 Dominants. \"Believe in yourself as I believe in you\" sings Glinda. The Higher Self KNOWS Dorothy AND her incarnations will succeed, BUT she concentrates on Dorothy since she is the Final Incarnation and is telling her that she has to find this out and prove it to herself I would change this slightly. Belief in yourself is the first step, but KNOWING who you are is your goal as knowing requires proof. \"Know yourself as I know you\" is the next step, for once you KNOW, you are only a step away from BEING your Higher Self. \"Think of home\" Glinda says. \"Think of me, your Higher Self' is implied for I AM you. Glinda asks Dorothy what she's learned. Dorothy responds, \"I've learned that I must look inside myself to find love\". As I've said before, English is a piss poor language to describe what she calls 'love' here. It is a woefully inadequate word to describe the awesome sensation that you receive from your Higher Self. I KNOW. I've felt it several times. When I was in the Forbidden City in China, I had to steady myself since it was SO powerful. 'Love' just is not the right word. You'll find out what I mean when it happens to YOU. By the time Dorothy is ready to return to 3rd density Earth, she's Awakened and is far from her Unawakened state of when the Higher Self, Glinda, decided it was time for shim's Final to Awaken. What a film! I encourage you to watch BOTH versions of The Wizard of Oz and see what YOU can see. This is one event that contains several keys very useful to a Very Advanced and Final Incarnations. Suppression of Individuality While I was getting up this morning, the radio talk show had an army sergeant on the line. The army guy said he saw a recruit with hair too long (cutting away individuality) and proceeded to lecture him. The recruit held up a card and the sergeant had to stop bitching. Why? The sergeant said recruits are given a card that they just have to hold up when being lectured. It’s a card that says the holder has being stressed and the stressor must stop! Can you believe that!? Next the radio took some calls from teachers saying they cannot praise students who do well, nor encourage competition among students for fear of inhibiting the slower ones. The kids can no longer play dodge ball or regular 'touch' football. Now they can only 'touch' someone with a ball of yarn in their hands! The radio moderator went into a speech on how people's individuality is being done away with it and everyone is supposed to be identical. THIS IS TRUE. This is part of the plan for readying Earthers for overt alien control. If you've read any of Wendell Stevens' books, such as Ummo, Iarga, Acart or other alien cultures, you'll find these cultures VERY uniform. Everyone is pretty much the same. Variety is almost non-distinguishable. They dress similar. Their homes are similar. They are BORING.

These have given those Higher Selves, who chose the Earther challenge, a great leap on those who chose the safer route of sequential incarnations. Also, the constant feed of information to the Higher Self from all shim's incarnations in a wide variety of time periods is tremendous. The U.S. is rapidly increasing the lists of \"You can’t say\" and 'You can't do\" while maintaining the. false statement of 'freedom'. True freedom, as stated in the Bill of Rights, no longer exists in this country, but most people refuse to admit this. This is due to if they did admit it, they would have to do something about it. Then, take into account the majority of people on Earth are minion incarnations who will do NOTHING as long as they're fed. One reason Earthers have been quarantined is because of the nature of the Higher Self­ incarnated Earther. OTHER PLANETS FEAR WHAT EXPOSURE TO EARTHERS WILL DO TO THEIR POPULATIONS. Earthers take their unique perspectives and try to spread them. True, poisons such as Earther religions (primarily one god religions) and arrogance are negatives, but there are those who have advanced beyond religions and do respect those different than themselves. These Advanced incarnations would do quite well with alien cultures because they would not try to change them, but appreciate them for their own uniqueness. Even so, these Advanced Earthers are STILL considered threatening to many alien planets. The independent natures and non-conformist attitudes of the Advanced Incarnations pose a different kind of perceived threat that might spread undesirable ideas among the locals. So, in order to try and get Earthers to fit into alien ideals, a suppression of individuality has been under way for some time. THIS IS ON PURPOSE. Knowing this, what can you do? Really nothing. As Monroe correctly said, you will not be able to change the direction that the planetary leaders are dragging Earthers (barring a major, planetary uprising). With all the minions, this is not possible. What you can do is continue to improve yourself, LEARN/READ/OBSERVE. It is much easier to beat the masses into conforming than to stifle individual thought, at least as of yet. They DO have plans to get into your thoughts as well. The true ONLY thing that will end the horrors of this Dark plan are Wild Cards such as Earth's Planetary Spirit and the 2012 time line ending. The government is trying to seriously zap the Earth Planetary Spirit by burying nuclear waste deep within. This is like a cancer to Earth. The governments and their Dark alien allies also, according to Bruce Cathie's books, are placing energy into Earth's major grid points to contain reactions of the planet. The last time such a control of the Planetary Spirit was attempted was in the last days of Atlantis, and we all know what happened when Earth said, \"NO!\". Atlantis was gone in one day, so is the power of a pissed planetary spirit! It's time for Earth to take charge again.

Beyond the Third Density EndGame Incamational Images Within The Higher Self (Special Gold Edition Segment) A simultaneously incarnating Higher Self has on the inner wall hundreds and hundreds of images of their incarnations that are ongoing in 3rd density Earth. That the images of that incarnation's head is on the inner Higher Self means that incarnation is still active in whatever time period (Earth or astral planes) that Higher Self chose for shim. This is controlled by the Nexus of Time within the Higher Self. You will not see any alien incarnations created on the inner Higher Self because, once that Higher Self chose to take on the simultaneous path, all alien incarnations will have been ended. You cannot have an alien incarnation at the same time as you are on the simultaneous path. These incamational images, via the Nexus of Time, are the sources of massive amounts of information going to your Higher Self. After the Game, ALL of this information plus everything you knew before joining the Game, will be available to you. We have all kinds of incarnations. Some die very old, some die very young and most die in every age in-between. Now this will be a mind numbing concept if you are not ready to grasp it, but because we are on the simultaneous path, even the incarnation whose body dies shortly after birth is not inactive until it is no longer on the astral. Some can remain on the astral for a long period. You could have an incarnation that died in 24 C.E. which is about 2000 years ago, still not dead in the frequency of 2003. That image is STILL on your Higher Selfs wall due to the fact that 'time' does not exist and certain incarnations can be suspended/time slowed down to accommodate the simultaneous path. This is difficult to understand. Don't get weary over it. Push it aside if you cannot yet handle the concepts. It isn't until the Final Incarnation is complete that the Final will access the Nexus of Time and summon all the incarnations back to that Higher Self, that the images are no longer present. As each incamational stream is pulled back within the Higher Self, that image fades from the wall. This will happen very quickly when the Final Incarnation performs this action. The orb on the Nexus of Time will revert to a smooth globe. The Nexus of Time itself will be reintegrated into the Higher Self as it will no longer be needed. The Nexus of Time is not an external device, but a creation of the Higher Self for use by that Higher Self The Game is over for shim. It's time to move on. This material is very, VERY Advanced. It may not help the incarnation reading it, but it definitely will help your Final Incarnation wherever shim may be. 1 347"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Higher Self & Incamational Stream Data (Special Gold Edition Segment) In other Matrix 5 segments, I've discussed both the inner and outer Higher Self from the perspective of a Final Incarnation. In this brief segment, I want to focus on the connection between the Higher Self and shim's hundreds and hundreds of incarnational streams. A look at the cover illustration shows a few of these streams connecting to various incarnations. There are well over 1,000 such streams for each simultaneous path Higher Self. The Higher Self is aware of each of these streams and shim's concentration on each of them is constant. If you look at your Higher Self, you could see the enormous amounts of information/experiences streaming into the Higher Self via the Nexus of Time connections and the images of the incarnations on the inner Higher Self wall. The data processing is blindingly rapid and not one bit of information is ever lost. You would find it amazing to watch. When it is necessary, the Higher Self sends a pulse of information to various incarnations. The pulse can be anything from an idea/thought to direct intervention in the incarnation’s life to prevent a rupture of the experiential path for that incarnation. Dreams and visions are two of the methods that the Higher Self can also use to communicate to shim's incarnation. It is interesting to see the pulse move down the stream. It is gold tinged and distinct from the rush of energy streaming into the Higher Self. If you ever get a Higher Self pulse, there is no comparison to the sensation. I have had many of them since Awakening. They can come at any time, I’ve discovered, and they have reached me no matter what I am doing at the time. This includes driving. I've had a few very interesting pulses when doing that. The Higher Self pulse is truly unique and extremely powerful. It contains an emotion that would the word 'love' is totally inaccurate to describe. There are no words to accurately describe this sensation, but the experience is beyond breathtaking. Of course, with certain incarnations, there is more activity, such as Dominant incarnations. Activity is unprecedented with the Final Incarnation, especially during the Awakening process of that incarnation. Once Awakened fully, the Final becomes more and more the Higher Self. This culminates in the Final Act and the summoning back of all the incarnational streams. Refer to that segment for more information on that topic. Once the Higher Self is reconstituted into shim’s complete form (minus Game adaptations), the total of all experiences (pre-Game and Game) is now part of the whole you and assists you with everything you will do in following stages of your progression. You have completed the 3rd density Game moving on. Meanwhile, back in the Game, the sequential Higher Selves will be slowly moving on and the Orion queen will still be looking for the non­ existent physical immortality. Aren’t you glad you chose the simultaneous path?! M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Latter Incarnational Stages of the 3rd Density Game (Special Gold Edition Segment) In the latter incarnational stages of your 3rd density Game experience, your Higher Self is breaking numerous experiential loops. The experiences have been sufficiently gained and the spirit has matured, in each of these incarnations, so that the loop breaking is self­ motivated. By 'latter incarnational stages of the Game', I am referring to a Higher Selfs Very Advanced and Final incarnations and not the 'time line'. While all simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves are having experiences in EndGame (for at least part of it), the latter stages can and do incarnate in almost any time period. This is dependent on the experiential needs of each Higher Self as to when shim wants to experience what. An Awakening Final Incarnation may discover various anomalies that shim has no conscious memory of being instructed about. Matrix V Gold Edition gives you the keys you need to proceed and embolden you to be adventurous. I have discovered several in my experience and I have discovered that some of them are not limited to Final Incarnations, but seem to be found in certain Very Advanced. One of these that I will mention is the silver cord. The silver cord I saw around me is not the same thing as the incarnational extension from the Higher Self. A few years ago, while doing an out of body journey, I noticed a silver wire in my bedroom. It was not attached to me but just there. I grabbed the cord and was rapidly transported somewhere else where I had a major personal event that I cannot discuss. The reason I am mentioning this is that you may well run into strange or unplanned experiences. If you are still fear bound, you will cringe at the unknown. If you are Higher Self/spirit in control, you will have the wisdom to know what you should do even if you don't know the outcome. I have seen the same type of silver wire near a few other people in the current time period. Although I have informed them of it, it will be up to them to get out of their bodies and decide what to do about it. That may or may not happen in their current incarnations, but this cord will be a phenomena that will be nearby until they have the ability to see it on their own and decide what they want to do. It may be that the silver wire cannot be utilized by any except the Awakened Final Incarnation. However the fact that the silver wire is there suggests to me that they are a Very Advanced and close to their Final. You cannot force these exotic experiences. You must be ready to handle them properly. If you are still fear bound and lack the adventurous spirit needed to be successful beyond the 3rd density, you will not be able to have these types of experiences. Fear is your greatest enemy in any and all densities. Yet a reckless nature can be just as bad. This is why the 3rd density Game adds much needed wisdom to your Higher Self. Without this wisdom, you could not function well in much higher densities. There are other beings, in higher densities, who have an interest in the Game in so far as they will ensure that the Game does not exceed its limits. There are those IN the Game who seek to force it to continue into densities of Balance. This just will NOT happen, no matter what they do. The Orion Empire is one of those who look for a technological means to expand the Game. They will have to learn the limits of the Game. The Game itself will eventually conclude, but that is FAR in the future and LONG after the simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves have departed. There is no rush. We have eternity, after all!

Observations: Polarities - Your Factions Are No Longer Significant When you have reached the levels of either Dominant, Very Advanced or Final Incarnations, you are leaving the matters that the polarities THRIVE on or have left most of them behind as you spiral upward. We are warned of the dangers of those STILL playing the Game who try and drag those spiraling out BACK into the Game. \"Be like us\", \"Believe like us\", \"Don't do/say things that make US uncomfortable\" and so on are all spewed forth by those in the polarities, especially the Light-siders. This is why M5 is often under attack from Light-sider groups because they can't stand independence of thought/ action especially when the source of it DOESN'T try to force it on them. They are SO use to mob rule/mentality that TRUE individuality has no place among them when it upsets the group. One of the dangers of being in the low-mid Advanced levels is that they cling to mid-level tactics, not having spiritually advanced enough to embrace the Law of Allowance. They FEAR what is different. If they were what they'd like everyone to believe, they would ignore what doesn't work for them and move on. Instead they wail and moan (savior complexes - pure mid-level and pure Light-side). They also work with a mob mentality (notice the over use of the words 'we' and 'us'). These types will exist right up to the end of 3rd density Earth BUT when you spiral sufficiently away from these gnats of the lower spirituality, you can say, \"Your faction is no longer significant\" and close your input channels to their ravings. They are part of the rocks on the Rocky Road that you must overcome IF you choose the faster path. It's interesting to that most of these types have alien sponsors. Hmmm, remember what I wrote in the Second Edition new materials about that. More on the Earth Quarantine This writing will further explore the Earth 'quarantine' imposed by the aliens. As I said earlier, the quarantine is to keep Earthers away from the general populace of alien planets. There are some flimsy excuses for it given by aliens, but the core reason is due to the massive difference between simultaneous Higher Self incarnations on Earth vs. sequential Higher Self incarnations on other worlds. Push the minion incarnations aside and you'll find Earthers with Higher Selves to be processing HUGE amounts of data from all incarnations in many 'time' periods. Meanwhile, sequential Higher Selves are processing the information available to one incarnation at a time. Beside the experiences being processed, Earther Higher Selves also have a total range of emotional expression. This lacks the control aliens have on their planets where they view emotional independence as contrary to stability. The genetic alterations, that have become Earther humans, are responsible for what we are today. We tend to have radical ideas, express all forms of emotions and can be extremely independent. These are viewed as threatening to the status quo of alien systems, hence the quarantine. Now, I can see aliens not wanting those obnoxious christian/muslim religions being spread beyond Earth as they cause nothing but problems and false dependencies. The aliens tip-toe far more around Very Advanced and, definitely, Final Incarnations due to their awareness, especially in a Final, of the Game and what is going on. You notice that all types of aliens come and go from Earth? If it were a true quarantine, NO aliens would be here. Not only do they come and go, but they also live among us in various disguises. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"Notice how few people are chosen as contactees? Do you also see the type of people they chose as contactees? Edward Meier in Switzerland, contactee of the Erran Pleiadians, is VERY uneducated and continually debases Earth humans (calls Earthers ’worms') in his materials. The Errans do nothing to discourage this. Another contactee, Alex Collier, is very Mid-level oriented, reveals himself as dependent on his Andromedan Zenetae contacts and fears for family and self so much so that he uses a mouthpiece to talk for him now and is very reclusive. Do you ever hear of an alien group contacting an Advanced incarnational Earther? Nope, and you probably will not. They love Lightsiders because Lightsiders love to give their power away and the aliens are held in awe by these contactees who never find fault with them or ask the hard questions. The Higher Selves in sequential incarnations are very aware of the Game of 3rd density and know well what is going on with the relatively small group of Higher Selves who have chosen the far more difficult Earther Path. They are really the group ultimately behind the quarantine. These Higher Selves, working through their incarnations, are trying to contain and even thwart those who have chosen the Earther Path. This is why the aliens and their Earther allies who control the planet are engaged in suppressing individuality. So-called 'political correctness' is a mask for trying to force Earthers (focused in the U.S.) to suppress individuality and embrace conformity. The 'you can't say/do' lists are growing in leaps and bounds partially to divide the population but more so to suppress the Earther Higher Selves in an attempt to delay their advancement. It's all part of the Game. It should not be looked at as vindictive by the sequential group, which is easier to say than agree with. The Game is far more intense than you can imagine, but understanding the Game will assist those Finals and Very Advanced Incarnations in being aware and knowing options open to them. Due to the nearness of the end of the world as we know it (2012), the Game players are rushing to forestall the inevitable. Hang in there, fellow simultaneous team. We are nearing the finish line! Body ID & Extinctions of Species The news last night had a segment about pandas and how there are only about 1000 of them left in the world. As usual, with a guilt/panic piece like that, there's lots of hand wringing and finger pointing. Actually the extinction of species has been part of the cycle since the creation of 3rd density Earth. Change is constant and a part of the Way things are. Due to immature/not mature enough and minion incarnations who revere physical life more than anything else (covered elsewhere in Matrix 5 materials), we have had this constant whining about species whose time has passed or is passing. Part of the passing is due to the Planetary Spirit no longer requiring incarnations in a particular plant or animal. The Planetary Spirit has no problem with shim's progression and has all the experiences, of being whatever species, stored within shim’s Higher Self. This does not mean that people should be reckless in dealing with Earth's plant/animal life. As with other polarity issues on this planet, you have two sides on this topic as well. There is the one with take/kill the resources at will and without regard, such as hunting for 'sport' when food is plentiful or damaging trees/forests for greed. The opposite is to submit yourself to nature and allow the resources to control you, such as not eating cows when people are starving or operating under the false belief that the nature realm is superior to the Earther Higher Self realm.

The clinging to life as 'sacred' is a feature of 3rd density that you will have to come to terms with. It isn't physical life that is sacred. The experiences GAINED through physical life are sacred. And by 'sacred', I DON'T mean bow/scrape/worship as that is power giveaway. These experiences are stored ETERNALLY within YOUR Higher Self. THAT is what is important as well as the Advancement gained by having these vast amount of experiences and what you've learned/how you've grown by having them.. The physical is ONLY the vehicle to learning. The Universal Laws, primarily Allowance, says that people have to Advance on their own levels and in their own times due to their individual paths and without coercion from those who have \"been there/done that\". The purpose of this segment, as well as Matrix 5's materials, is NOT to MAKE you act ANY way. What I continue to do is give you glimpse of true realities for your consideration. ALL species will eventually become extinct. It's a 3rd density hallmark. Earther (Higher Self incarnated) humans will eventually become extinct as well. This is VERY good as that shows that those Higher Selves have all completed the Game successfully. Clinging to life at the denial of experiences is what the Game wants vou to do. Deny your spirit since, they say, your physical life is everything. It is not. That is a lie which is the core word in the word beLIEve. You will have to come to your own realizations of this. Remember what I've said here and in Matrix 5. What the Higher Densities are NOT The Light polarity followers, the Lightsiders, would have everyone believe that it is necessary to conform to their restrictive standards of speech and mannerisms ‘in order to pass into higher densities’. As with the Dark polarity, a prime feature of polarities is setting fences of 'you can/can't do/say'. The polarities are behind the current limiting society present in the U.S. today. Lightsiders are notorious for trying to force everyone to 'behave', to get along, to be 'nice' with each other and to ‘conform’. Doesn’t' this sound like the alien interference to stifle individuality? Yes, it does as the aliens continue to interfere on Earth. Throw in some colorful words like 'fuck', 'cunt' or 'shit' and watch them roll their eyes and shudder in pious revulsion. (Read my Matrix 5 writings on so-called 'dirty' words.) No, they say, you can't say that for they are offended. GOOD! Let them be offended. They may wake up if offended enough. Lightsiders would have everyone believe that the higher densities are like Christian 'heaven'. This is FAR from true. If you want Christian 'heaven' you can go to Monroe focus level 25. That this is BELOW the Park/Library level 27 should tell you something. The higher densities do not get hung up on words and mannerisms as INDIVIDUALITY is not only respected but is necessary to succeed and interact on those levels and individuality is encouraged and unrestricted. Lightsiders have made themselves the priesthood of language and manners. Priesthoods take power away from the people. Reclaim your power and stop worrying what others think.

Another comment Lightsiders like to use is that they are in 'balance'. They also like to say that balance, is everyone loving and, basically, like being in Christian 'heaven'. Hell, it IS the Christian heaven with New Age clothing! These Lightsiders haven’t a clue what Balance is. To reach Balance you have to overcome this love & light bullshit! Love, from the Balance perspective, is vastly different that the 'love' of the Lightsider polarity. Balance 'love' is far more intense and very genuine. Lightsider 'love' is plastic and lip service. All this will become clearer to you as you advance. It will unfold for you and you will eventually say 'Now I know what he was talking about'. Hang in there. Observations: Matrix V - Guide or \"bible\"? When I wrote my material in Matrix 5, it was intended to serve as a guide by giving my experiences and discoveries. Many readers DO see it as intended, but there are those who are trying to make it their New Age religion and, therefore, a bible. When these people make M5 a source for their religion, it indicates they are still experiencing mid-Advanced levels w r hich still require some type of external control device(s). I bounced a person, from the Matrix V Forum (when it existed), who was \"trying to convince\" others to \"follow\" M5 and then he gets upset because I won't be his 'master'. It is SO easy for Earthers to corrupt anything they get their hands on due to DNA command structures and their current level of spiritual progression. TRUE individuality scares them. You cannot progress to higher than 4th densities unless you can function as an individual. This occurs, guaranteed, in your Final Incarnation. Another bounced person was just one in a steady line of people who want to give their power away to me and I DON'T want it! There are plenty of people out there who would be more than happy to take your power. Earthers are SO use to giving away their power to externals that they don't know how to react when someone DOESN’T want it. They have tried various victim/victimizer modes to attempt to make me their teacher/'master'. It will NOT work with me. This is why I say Matrix 5 is for VERY Advanced and Final Incarnations. Low through mid-Advanced, while able to glean varying amounts of very useful information from M5, ALWAYS want to bow before some power-taking 'master' (too much fluoride/aspertame in their systems combined with a not-Advanced-enough spirit). These types slither into the Group (not difficult), but when their agenda blooms, out the door they go. I will not allow the Group to be polluted by those who have less than Very Advanced spiritual mindsets. When they get bounced, the victim/ victimizer mode REALLY shows in their sobbing 'why did you bounce me' emails. Everyone's Path is unique to their Higher Self. My experiences are mine and you may well NOT have many that I have had. That's up to your Higher Self. Some things written in M5 are other density realities that are fixed, such as the Library on Monroe focus level 27 (even though that will have a limited existence as Monroe knew). The appearance of the Higher Selves is also another fixed reality, as shown on the cover of M5. As I've continually said, you MUST go within to find YOUR Path and YOUR experiences.

Your Higher Self is benefiting from the information you’ve read in M5 and it IS of use to your Very Advanced and Final incarnations elsewhere in 'time'.

There is an artist's rendering of a small section of the Library in the M5 materials. You can find basically whatever you want to learn of about 3rd density events and more. At the Library, you can receive assistance in your search. Robert Monroe, in his must read trilogy, states that the Library is a temporary feature since it is no longer there in a future vibration. This is because the simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves have departed the Game and the Library, which was created for Higher Self incarnations, no longer serves a purpose. You will have several incarnations that access this structure. For one, ALL Awakened Final Incarnations do use it and what they learn there forms the basis of many 'ideas' that seem to pop into their minds while incarnate. If that Awakened Final has conscious astral travel ability, shim can go there any time shim desires in the pursuit of information necessary for that incarnation. When you create your own residence on level 27, as per training at The Monroe Institute, you can also install direct access to the Library. Here's a revelation for you: The Library was constructed bv all the Hieher Selves engaged in simultaneous incarnations and contains information gathered bv these incarnations. The reason why the Library will cease is that these Higher Selves will it to cease and stop inputting energy into it upon leaving to higher densities. If any Higher Self moves on before the others, the Library will remain. It only takes one Higher Self to keep it in existence. So, basically, when the last Higher Selves move up from simultaneous 3rd density paths, they will figuratively 'close the light' on that project. In the Library, you can locate VERY interesting information on any historical event you may wish to find the truth on. Atlantis...yep, easy - what were they involved with when it sank and what aliens were also involved? The Pyramids of Egypt - discover who built them and the myth of slave labor to construct them. What hand did the Orion/Sirian Empires have in Egypt? Roman Empire - what really went on in private and how the Vatican is a remnant of the empire. Ancient Earthers - the circumstances surrounding the split from uni-gender to 2 separate genders and the heavy alien hand. Formation of the USA and George Washington - loads of myths about that exist today. Slave owner Washington was not the saintly person they’d like you to believe. Abraham Lincoln, traitor to his office as President for scraping the Constitution in i860 and who was pushing his buttons.

Slaves were never included since those who ran the country, all Masonic leaders, knew of the creation/purpose of that race from the aliens who did the creating and the destiny of the Game at that stage. Franklin Roosevelt who allowed the bombing of Pearl Harbor at the demand of who controlled his buttons at the time. Actually you can read about the string of oath breakers who have always been in control in the US and other supposedly 'free' countries. You can read the real histories without the deceptive illusions called 'history' today. Which aliens was Hitler dancing too and what his American backers hoped would never see the light of day? Actually, there is no event you couldn't find in the Library and the information is pure. Of course when you can consciously go there and see for yourself, you don't go snatching records and reprinting what you know for anyone who wants to read on 3rd density. There's a matui'ity aspect involved to those with conscious access. If you seek information to use against the Game, your Higher Self will not permit that from the incarnation. That is part of the Game rules your Higher Self agreed to. You can use the information to instruct yourself for personal knowledge, but not to crusade and seek to undo the Game. What I tell you in Matrix 5 is for personal enhancement and deception- removing ONLY. YOUR Higher Selves know that as well. Several of our Higher Selves are doing a lot of extra to assist our fellow simultaneous incarnating beings. When you reach that final stage and recall your incarnations, you will learn A LOT more information that will take you considerable time to process. It is worth the wait. 1116 Library on 27 - Part II (Special Gold Edition Segment) A comment was made to me that isn't the Library on Monroe focus level 27 \"man made\". This requires a double answer. For one, \"man made\" shows a lack of understanding about the incarnation. \"Man made\" refers to a body creation. 3rd density bodies cannot create anything other than 3rd density objects. Astral objects are Higher Self made or Higher Self incarnation made. The second part of that comment is that although incarnations on the astral do create objects/homes, etc and they can alter the Library building shape, the information itself is generated by the Higher Selves engaged in simultaneously incarnating. All this information can also be found within your own Higher Self. This information will remain as long as a single simultaneously incarnating Higher Self is participating in the Game. The Library is NOT available to sequential incarnations. While that group has conscious memories of their ‘past lives’, a bonus for the far slower progression of sequential incarnation, the Library is a bonus for the rapid path simultaneous group. Before the Game had begun, those Higher Selves, who agreed to participate, agreed to the rules of the Game. Just as when you play chess or any other rule-bound game, you don't change the rules once the game has started. Your Higher Self is conscious of all Game rules even though the incarnations of that Higher Self do not. Your Higher Self will ensure that the rules shim agreed to are maintained in the Game. Robert Monroe is to thank for bringing conscious awareness of level 27 and the features of that level. When/if you create a residence on level 27, you can have a link to the Library. It can be a computer-like device or even books on shelves. I have a book for each year of my current incarnation's life, for example. When I open any of them, I can read what I was doing. If I open the current year, the latest entry is \"Then I opened my book on the astral\".

Besides reading any historical truths about Earth, untainted by the polarities, you can read other 3rd density histories as well. Information on the reptilians, the oldest race in the galaxy, is abundant. Also how they began as male-dominated society at first before the far more vicious females ruthlessly seized power.You can read about alien alignments, polarities and wars. Sequential aliens have exceedingly LONG histories due to the nature of their incarnational path. Much of the alien histories comes from sequential incarnates who decide to switch to the simultaneous path. It is not common, but it does happen that an alien living among Earthers becomes enamored with the simultaneous path and that Higher Self changes path. This is allowed by Game rules. This is one of the reasons for Earth's quarantine by aliens, as discussed in earlier Matrix V materials. I have never been to the Library when it is crowded. People are always coming and going from it, but no mobs. If an incarnation is not mentally oriented on Earth, that incarnation will not be on the astral.Those drawn to the Library are those who were mentally oriented. If an incarnation is not sufficiently Advanced, there is a fear of what the incarnation may learn in the Library. Icons are smashed. Deceptions are shredded away when you access the Library's materials. Are you able to handle that? If so, you will welcome the knowledge. If not, you will avoid it. However, a more Advanced incarnation of your Higher Self will definitely embrace the Library and your Awakened Final Incarnation will spend a great deal of time there while shim's physical, Earther body sleeps. The Library is the most fascinating feature on level 27, in my opinion, due to the immense amount of information available to those who know what to search for. We have our Higher Selves (which, as you know by now, are the REAL we) for deciding to incorporate this into the Game. The Game & Galaxies (Special Gold Edition Segment) In the Matrix 5 materials, I have continually referred to The Game and how it applies to Higher Selves involved with both the simultaneous and the sequential paths. Earth is the center of the Game in this galaxy due to this being the planet for simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves. The information that I have given in Matrix 5 refers to THIS Game in 3rd density Earth. This Game is strictly taking place in the Milky Way galaxy. In one of my weeks at the Monroe Institute, we had an exercise that took us far beyond our galaxy. From the blackness beyond, I looked to the left and to the right. I saw different galaxies in both directions. What is going on in each of those galaxies are THEIR versions of The Game and each is being played by other Higher Selves on either simultaneous or sequential paths. A simpler way to explain this is to say, if you are playing a game of Monopoly on one table, others are playing Clue on another table and still others play something else on another table (and so on), you have various games going on at once. Think of each table as a galaxy. The Games are different BUT the each Game has the same basic goals: to gain experiences and escape (end) the Game. If you are playing Game A, you cannot go to Game C and barge in. You (your Higher Self) chose which, of all the Games available, to play.

The basic experiences are the same, but the settings can be VASTLY different. We can all have access to information from all the galaxies when necessary, but after you have had your Awakened Final Incarnation here. Your concentration and focus belong here, not in the other galaxies. There is A LOT of variety and outstandingly interesting things going on 'out there'. In order to appreciate them fully, you must complete your Advancement cycles here. You need that wisdom and maturity to handle that information properly. As we progress in EndGame on the 3rd density, the Game here is rapidly drawing to its conclusion. It won't be long now before it is time for us to move onward.

The First Experiential Loop (Special Gold Edition Segment) In Robert Monroe's trilogy, he mentions the desire to return \"home\". He persisted in this desire until he was taken back to his first known \"home\". In this location, the spirit beings found there had the ultimate in naive attitudes. Monroe said that the music and colors were amazing. The simple games that the beings were playing caused them much joy. At first he couldn’t figure why he chose to leave that location. Then he noticed that the music became repetitive as were the games. Those engaged in these activities were not interested in anything he had to say that was contrary to the music and their games. What Bob saw was a very spiritually primitive experiential loop involving music and lights. He had Advanced so far that it didn't take long for him to see this. He now knew why he left this location in search of more. When one of these beings breaks this experiential loop, they move away from here in search of new experiences and, yes, what turns out to be new experiential loops. After this primitive music/lights loop is broken, the being moves elsewhere until they discover one of the Games being played in the 3rd density. The maturing being looks at each of the Games and decides which one shim would like to play, knowing that they will only choose to play one Game to get the experiences shim needs. Each galaxy is another Game where polarities rage, although the settings are different in each one. In our galaxy, the reptilians are the oldest race. In other galaxies, other beings are the oldest race there, for example. The Game-searching being discovers the rules and the sides that can be taken in each Game, the advantages and the disadvantages of all. The being notes that no matter which Game is chosen, if shim decides to enter a Game, that the end results are the same. The being realizes that if shim wants to Advance, a Game must eventually be chosen, but the decision is shim's own and no coercion is ever used. The being that Monroe met on a higher density who demanded that Bob worship shim because \"I am your god\" was a being who has become familiar with the various versions of the Game and attempted to use what shim knew about our galaxy's Game to influence Bob. The being had no genuine power over Bob and knew it. So when Bob refused, the being went off in a fit of frustration. A Game involved simultaneously incarnating Higher Self has tremendously more abilities than one of these pre-Game beings. 357"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Experiential loops, from the original \"home\", that Monroe mentions in his books, all the way through the huge number of loops that we experience in the Game are all part of our learning experiences. Successfully breaking/overcoming these loops is similar to taking another step in a board game bringing you one place closer to wining. Think about this segment. Remember who you REALLY are and get ready for where you are going! [Ed.- See last page of book for Part II - a post-production segment!] Galactic Endgame (Special Gold Edition Segment) EndGame on 3rd density Earth has been discussed in the Matrix 5 materials. Now I will tell you a bit more about Galactic EndGame. Read the Gold Edition segment entitled Incarnating Paths and Higher Self Individuality first to get a reference point. The group that handles physical EndGame is the Nature Spirit Higher Selves. The simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves are the first to complete the Game. MUCH later, the sequentially incarnating Higher Selves, according to their group Advancement, complete the Game, at different stages, with the reptilians finishing last. The reptilians are the most resistant to spiritual Advancement. They prefer technological experiences. The more technological the sequential race is, the longer it takes to develop spirituality. Nevertheless, the reptilians will eventually complete their cycle and move on. Meanwhile, the Nature Spirit path develops their own experiences/growth. When a Nature Spirit Higher Self complete a cycle, the planet they inhabit becomes dead. This does not mean that all \"dead\" planets are former Nature Spirit occupied worlds. There are many planets created just as mineral deposits by the Nature realm. These are not dead planets, just because plant/animal life does not exist. These are used by the Nature realm for mineral experiences. What these are will be made known to you when it is necessary. A true dead planet has no minerals and will not grow any plant life. Mars, for example, is not a dead planet, although it has been severely battered by the Orion Empire in the distant past. Moving on, when a solar system has completed its cycle, the sun goes nova and explodes. The solar system Higher Self (Nature spirit inhabiting the sun) moves to the next level of shim’s progression. The exploding sun signals the end in that system. As Galactic EndGame arrives, exploding suns will become more and more common. That is still quite a way off using linear time as a reference. Black holes are another cleanup device. They draw into them whole systems that are broken down to their basic matters/energies. Black holes will become more and more common as galactic EndGame approaches. By then, we simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves will be LONG gone. It is not necessary for us to dwell on Galactic EndGame. This information is given just to give you a preview feel for what this final EndGame event will be like in our galaxy. Post Game: Review,Compare & Share (Special Gold Edition Segment) We have all heard about how one's life 'flashes before your eyes' when death comes knocking at your body's incarnational door. This is the disruption of one of the DNA filters in your physical body and allows you to briefly tap into your Higher Selfs memory stream for that particular incaniation in a genuine death situation. This is a rapid review of that incarnation’s experiences stored within YOUR Higher Self.

All Rights Reserved. When your Final Incarnation has concluded and that incarnation summons, via the Nexus of Time, all of that Higher Selfs incarnations to return to that Higher Self, that Higher Self spends a brief (relatively speaking) amount of time reviewing ALL of shim's incarnations and experiences. This is a look-back and sorting of a tremendous amount of invaluable information. This self-review has been warped by religions to become a 'judgment'. This is an outright LIE! The lie exists to attempt to keep you in fear. When in fear, you are so easy to control. When you are out of fear, you cannot be controlled. No other Higher Self (that has participated in the Game) will find anything but fascination to view your experiences and visa-versa. One Higher Self may say, \"you really had some time in the Game pillaging those villages\" or \"interesting that you chose so many lives as a prostitute\" or \"what were the most important experiences you had as a member of the SS in World War II?\" or \"you really learned a lot during that phase of your Advanced incarnational series\" and so on. The questions/observations can last a very long time if you used Earth 'time' as a gauge. Remember, time does not exist and you have eternity to do whatever you choose. Higher Selves will choose situations where they are the central character in some experiences, others where they are a support character in some experiences; some where they are the oppressor and some where they are the oppressed. Certain Higher Selves will choose to experience many incarnations with their Higher Self friends while in the Game. Roles will have been switched and interchanged many times over. Experiences galore will have been gained. Just think how much you have to discuss with a friend who you participate in activities with on the limited scale of a single incarnation. Try to imagine that on a scale of thousands times thousands times thousands! Not only that, but each Higher Self has the ability to share via rote which is the ideal form of communication. Rote communications bring multi-sensorials into play: sound, light, color, texture, 3D, and more. The materials that I have been releasing under the Matrix 5 umbrella would not have been possible without assistance from other Higher Selves and their incarnations. For example, without Val's assistance, the M5 materials would not have been bound and published so anyone could obtain them. Yes, I would have written them and shared them with a very few, close friends, but this material is FAR too important to have such a limited exposure. Hence this time period of mass, global communications and the internet were necessary. There are some Higher Selves acting in a seemingly minor, but important (to me) roles of support. I will not go into that here, but just know they exist. This information dissemination was planned for EndGame a long time ago. You now have the reality in your hands. Wait until YOUR Higher Self sees the reviews that you are interested in. Consider the Game and The Players (Special Gold Edition Segment) When you are playing a board or similar type of game with your friends, each of you takes on a different role during the game and during game activity. You become adversaries in the sense that you work within the rules of that game to win. This can include harming the other players' characters as in Dungeons and Dragons style games which can be quite elaborate. This can involve penalizing someone's game piece or even giving your best friend the queen of spades in the card game of Hearts. You can also play games where you have game level friends and work together to succeed. 359"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"These examples are all minor versions of the 3rd dimensional Game we are in. Higher Selves love games. The numerous Higher Selves that are playing the Game are not adversaries away from the Game although they can be IN the Game. The sequentially incarnating aliens are playing against the simultaneously incarnating Earther humans. Just as in D&D, they may (and do) perform actions that are harming your pieces (incarnations). In the Game, you DO have some other Higher Selves who are your allies and you have many incarnational interactions with them. You assist each other in varied ways depending on the incarnation involved. This is mirrored by you and your best friend playing a board game as a team. You can still play the same game with other friends, but they choose pieces that try and keep you from winning. In the 3rd density Game, the reptilians and their allies are some of the major pieces working to keep us from completing. BUT this does not mean that their Higher Selves are 'enemies' outside the Game. They are not! As I've said in other segments, the Game is multi-faceted and far more complex than the simple, non-existent 'good vs evil' that many would like to think it is. The Game is operating on several levels with different benefits on each one of them. Eventually the Game will end, first for simultaneous incarnates then for sequential. After the Game ends, all the players will spend much 'time' reviewing and comparing notes about the playing of the Game. This is discussed in another segment. This past weekend, I attended a science fiction convention. There was an actor from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (my favorite Trek series) who asked the rhetorical question, \"why are the aliens always portrayed as bad guys\". Those familiar with Matrix 5 will know the answer to that BUT those incarnates who cannot see the forest for the trees can only still see 'good vs evil'. What the actor refers to as 'bad guys' is a comment on the sequential incarnates' playing pieces in the Game, but not the players who control the pieces. You won't fully be able to appreciate the Game for what it is until your have completed the Game and had your full memory restored. Your Awakened Final Incarnation will learn A LOT about it (you have NO idea how much), but there is far more that will be apparent after the Final Incarnation has summoned all shim’s simultaneous streams back via the Nexus of Time. Bear this segment in mind when you observe the 3rd density Game in motion. Higher Self Departure - Game Graduate (Special Gold Edition Segment) When a Higher Selfs Final Incarnation's physical has died and after that incarnation has finished shim's last tasks on the astral, the Final Incarnation returns to within shim's Higher Self to summon back all the existing simultaneous streams of that Higher Self. Something to keep in mind when considering this segment - I have written that when the Higher Self chooses to take on the simultaneous path that all alien/sequential incarnations have been absorbed by that Higher Self, hence there are no sequential incarnation images to be found on the Higher Self inner wall. They are already processed by you. When I state that each simultaneously incarnating Higher Self has over 1000 incarnations (hundreds and hundreds), this figure does not include sequential incarnations that have occurred before choosing the simultaneous path. How many total incarnations you experience in the 3rd density Game would astound you. You will discover YOUR answers to this when you have graduated from the Game and review all of your experiences. The Final Incarnation moves to operate the Nexus of Time when ready to spiral away from the Game. The orb of the Nexus of Time is multi-faceted. The top, center facet is circular.

All Rights Reserved. 360"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. All other facets are of all different kinds of shapes - triangles, squares, pentagon, rectangles, etc. Each one is unique to one of your simultaneous incarnations. The Final Incarnation knows how to use this orb to recall the energy streams. \"Time\" ceases to exist for these energies as they are reabsorbed into the Higher Self. The last facet, the top circular one is the facet of the Final Incarnation. The Final Incarnation does not travel within the Higher Self like a figure within a glass snow ball. When all incarnations are reabsorbed, the Higher Self reintegrates the Final Incarnation as well, discarding the Earther image which is no longer necessary. The images are no longer on the walls of the Higher Self. The Nexus of Time has served its purpose and is no longer needed by the Higher Self. The energy, that the Higher Self used to create the Nexus of Time, returns to that Higher Self. The former Final Incarnation is no longer only a composite of 3-4 Dominant Incarnations, but, instead has become the newest version of the Higher Self. The new Higher Self is shed of all images/deceptions of the Game and is rich with fantastic amounts of experiences, sensations, emotions, etc from ALL incarnations in the Game, both simultaneous AND sequential. Now you move on to new experiences that you could not have appreciated at all or be capable to handle without having been a player in the Game of Third Density. The Real Wonders: Beyond Earth In Ultimate Journey, Monroe correctly states that the real problem, for explorers in the higher densities, is in attempting to translate what one finds into Earther languages. Many times I've told Val on the phone of wonders I've witnessed and beings conversed with, but that the English language is way too inferior to translate the information into. For example, English has 1 word (love) with many interpretations. Better that there were many words for the various expressions of love and each had its own connotation. When the wonders beyond 3rd density Earth are seen and interacted with, you life can never be the same again. Your vision looks beyond humdrum, every day Earth life to what lies ahead. True, you have no interest in these matters before your incarnational progress moves into Advanced levels and the ability to travel thusly will not likely arrive before VERY Advanced levels due to the maturity needed to interact with these vastly different events and beings. Not only have you experienced, but you no longer rely on belief. Belief is for those who have not seen nor experienced. Once you have seen and experienced, even if no one believes you, it doesn't matter. Experiences are confirmations to you and that is what counts. Your life changes...YOU change! In this series of articles, I have told you SOME of my experiences and wonders seen...such as the Higher Self, the appearance both inner and outer of the Higher Self, the Ancient Earth humans, alien genetic scientists, and much more. THERE ARE MUCH, MUCH GREATER WONDERS TO BE SEEN AND EXPERIENCED. There are many beings in the upper astral, but more far interesting ones beyond 4th density. If you went beyond the level where the Higher Selves reside, having 3rd density Earther experiences, you would appear as a dwarf among giants. This is because you are only one incarnation interacting among completed Higher Self expressions (giants). Once your Final Incarnation is over and shim has pulled all incarnations within that individual Higher Self, you are complete and move to the next level of experiences. You are THEN as the seeming giants you talked to as a dwarf. Not only that, existences on these levels are NOTHING like Earth.

For 3 rd density visuals, go to the Orion star, Mintaka, and see the reptilian queen's home world or go see underground Earth alien bases, but be VERY careful. There are astral alarms to let them know when someone is poking around. Unless you are VERY Advanced, I wouldn't even try it. Go beyond our galaxy (not solar system, but galaxy) and see what you see. What I've seen would be breath-taking if we had to breathe out of body, which we don't. Yes, you can time travel. Go to 2200 and see what there ISN'T to see on Earth. Go to 1600 and see what was. Go to Atlantis and even earlier. These are wonders too, but nothing like what is to come. For when you are ready for these events, all the Earther stuff seems so minor. ALL of this will come to each Higher Self in time and on their individual Path. Words just cannot do justice to what is. Monroe knew this and I know this. You will, too, when it's your turn.

Most of a Higher Selfs incarnations have a basic through mid-level perspective. Many are quite advanced, including 3-4 dominant incarnations (circles) and one 3rd density Final Incarnation (solid circle) for that Higher Self. All these incarnations are YOU having experience on 3rd density Earth. Through these 3rd density Earth incarnations, you experience every gender, every race, every sexual orientation and hundreds of variations and combinations of experience, including more than 1000 variations on the physical death experience. All this experience is funneled to your Higher Self (YOU) and specifically chosen by YOU. From a 3rd density perspective, if we were to give each incarnational life an average lifetime of 50 years, we could say that we would be experiencing 50,000 to 80,OOO years on Earth at once! There are also Higher that choose not to participate in the 3rd density experience, preferring experience on other levels that are 'less challenging'. These matters, and more, are discussed in this book. In contrast, other evolutionary paths also exist on the 3rd density. The predominant evolutionary pathway is the sequential path, typified by humanoid life forms alien to Earth humans. Higher Selves on the sequential pathway experience one incarnation at a time, in a linear sense, retaining full memory from incarnation to incarnation - and also retaining all the baggage with it. The sequential path is a far slower method of evolution than the simultaneous path. Alien races that have been on their path for billions of years are less spiritually advanced than those on the simultaneous path, yet they represent themselves as otherwise to those lightside polarity mid-level perspectives who defer to everything outside themselves and also equate technology with spiritual advancement. Sequential incarnational lives are typically long, some extending as long as several thousand years at a time. That's a lot of baggage. The greatest fear among sequential incarnations is the prospect of losing memory of previous incarnations. Only sequential path 'reincarnates' into a body on 3rd density. In this incarnational path, the sequential Higher Self extends into the 3rd density, over and over. With the simultaneous path, the Higher Self remains on higher densities and project more than a thousand simultaneous extensions into 3rd density, once. The perspective of most of your 3rd density incarnations is linear, although many of your incarnations have the ability to see outside the box when they progress to a more advanced perspective and the accompanying experience that goes with it. Earth is the 'island' in this 'galaxy of sequentials' for those with simultaneous incarnational paths, because of the intense concentration of polarities and diversity of experience. Other galaxies have similar dynamics. Since the operative path dynamic in this galaxy is sequential, they don't want the unique individualism of advanced simultaneous incarnations 'polluting' their 'everyone is the same' sequential philosophy and control systems out there with individualism brought from Earth. This is why Earth humans were not allowed to develop a real space program. Societies composed of sequential incarnations evolve as 'whole races', rather than as individual members. A slow way to progress, but 'safe' from their point of view. They cannot comprehend what it's like to experience a lifetime without immediate memory of all other lifetimes. For us, it's all retained in the Higher Self, but is accessible by advanced simultaneous incarnations.

The Library on Focus 27 I have made several references to the Library on Monroe level 27 and, in this edition of Matrix 5, we now include this artwork based on what I have seen when visiting this section of the Library. The first view is from the top. The book stack are immense. This section is immediately to your left upon entering the Library. While you can browse the shelves, it is not necessary. A person in the Library told me that all you have to do is think of what you want and it will appear in your hands. I followed his instruction and items appeared amazingly easily. When you are finished with the book, it will return to where it belongs as your thought releases it. A question was posed to me as to if there are computers and DVD systems in the Library. Since computers have only been in popular use for 10 to 15 years out of the thousands of years of incarnational time on Earth, they have not taken the place of books and scrolls which have been in use for thousands of years. DVD's have even less use in 3rd density Earth time. You could easily create a computer terminal by will alone. I have one in my home on Focus 27 for my own use, created when I was at one of the Monroe Institute weeks. I find I've moved beyond that as there is another section in the Library even more impressive than the stacks of books/scrolls. You can imagine what someone from 354 BCE would say upon seeing computer terminals. You can receive rotes of materials. A rote is a term used by Monroe to refer to an energy bundle of information complete with all facets of the data, both practical, emotional and sensory. This is a far more advanced way of receiving information and is the way of information transfer in the higher densities. You will know, when you visit, if you are ready to receive information this way. This is the preferred way of information receiving by Awakened Final Incarnations, but it doesn't mean they don’t scan through the books for variety. The rooms you see on your right, as you enter the Library, are lecture/classrooms. Groups can meet in here to discuss anything they wish. You may also find open lectures on varieties of topics given here. When the cover of Matrix 5 was completed, the artwork appeared on one wall in the Libraiy with a golden glow around it, as shown in the new diagram. I was told certain Higher Selves installed this in the Library due to the importance of the picture and the needed keys many will find there. They are absolutely overjoyed at having that artwork on the third and fourth densities along with the text. Once Matrix 5 was published, a shelf appeared under the wall picture. On this shelf, a copy of Matrix 5 is always available. If someone takes a copy, another appears. If a copy is replaced, there is only one on the shelf. Always only one copy. This is an interesting phenomena that occurs in the Park area. Books/scrolls are never missing as when one is taken another appears in its place. I have seen this occur outside of the Library as well. The Libraiy is HUGE. Go through the archway to your right, by the Matrix 5 display, and you will come to even more books/scrolls and more. The second visual shows an incarnation walking through the stacks and you get an idea of the immense nature of the Library. Most people on level 27 wear a loose-fitting robe, not as tight as in Defending Your Life, but not billowy either. Very Comfortable. These 2 pieces of art will give you a great idea of what the Library looks like and what to expect when YOU arrive there. Many thanks to the graphic artist: Arthur J.

Gold Edition 2003 - 122 additional Q&A over 2 nd Edition During the last three years this material has been exposed to the population, with tens of thousands of viewers on the world wide internet, there were hundreds of questions asked of the author about the material and the concepts presented. The author chose to take questions and provide answers on the material from readers, and they are presented here for further enhancement. (Val) The Q&A's are for further clarification of the material, not for personal interpretations. Suggestion: For maximum benefit, it’s vital that you read all of these , and then go back and re-read all segments. You’ll understand it in an even more expanded context. If you choose not to do this, it’s your choice and your loss of additional enhancement. (The -- ------------- ------- - divider separates Q&A pairs from different individuals) Question 1: \"I'm curious about the topic of ET-manipulated near-death experiences. It's been mentioned by CRG & others that those “New Age” phenomena have been artificially or technologically induced in some cases. The previously mentioned article in the latest LEIRJ mentions that the \"light\" is a deception to keep souls from leaving the Earth planes. Does this mean that when people are headed to the light or guided to the light, that the scenario is necessarily being created by the controlling entities?\" Answer: \"This is the first comment to recognize that no value judgment is intended in the material, and I'm VERY glad to see someone get it. What is...is. This is why, when one reaches their Final Incarnation, they can see the Game for what it is. They won't be coming back and it IS necessary to understand what has been going on. If a person is guided by another being after death, they should go with them if it feels right. On the other hand, if confronted by the light tunnel where figures in the distance wave you in, that's the trap and you should avoid walking in at all costs. The figure(s) in the light trap do not come up to you and converse. They try to wave you in. They look like people you were most comfortable with. This is an illusion. This is being created by the Markab (see Matrix II).\" Question 2: \"1 would think that this phenomenon would also occur naturally for those with a certain \"dependency\" for the light and Earth-life entities. If souls are being deceived, then it is important for this information to be revealed - this awareness would be a part of the soul's evolution toward moving beyond the Earth experiences. Thus, both the deceivers and the revealers are playing a useful role in the development of Spirit (Spirit experiencing via soul incarnations).\" Answer: It IS important that souls be aware of the light trap. This is why it was placed by Val in Matrix II a decade ago. That it needed to be addressed again shows the need to understand this device and avoid it. The Dark side intends to do no favors for any developing spirit. Their purpose is that Earthers (not Earthlings - an alien term regarding Earthers as children who need their watching and control) breed, have internal conflicts, produce, be a food source and more to the Empire. That Higher Selves have turned this great disadvantage into a learning experience and an accelerated growth for spirits 374"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. choosing to accept the challenges, gives ultimate success to the Higher Selves. This doesn't prevent Dark from trying to undo that, hence the light trap. If they can keep souls from returning to the higher astral, they will have succeeded, at least for a time, in delaying the inevitable. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 3: The use of the word \"Game\" brings up curiosity about its particulars. Any links or other info describing The Game in resonance with , the context of Thought Patterns? Answer: The use of the word 'Game' originates with the Higher Selves. The Empire and the Dark do NOT consider it a game in any way and do not appreciate the reference. Game is used because of the challenges and object: to overcome all the Empire's best technology and manipulation to regain your identity (Final Incarnation), gather huge amounts of sensory experiences/emotional experiences and develop wisdom. It is a challenge in that you begin with no memory of who you are and have to regain it by means your own Higher Self decides. There is no single path to this enlightenment but there are many false paths put there by the Empire and the Dark to keep you from finding yourself (religion, for example). Every Higher Self will succeed, some faster and some slower, but all will eventually succeed. To find out what you need to do, you must access your Higher Self. Robert Monroe developed the key to this. It is to access a level of consciousness that Monroe called Focus 12. That's how I learned and I know no other way. It's a matter of going within instead of without. When Monroe told the one group I was in how to do it, no one, except me, was interested in doing so. This is something a Final Incarnation really wants to do (access the Higher Self). It cannot be done by someone for you as only you (as your Dominant and Final Incarnations) can have this access and Dominants may not consciously realize they've been there (during sleep) unless psychic oriented. The material I've been releasing (Val had most of it on his site) has not been released publicly for thousands of years. You can find threads of it in Credo Mutwa's material and Robert Monroe's books, for example. This material is highly suppressed and you can see why. Val is to be honored for putting it out for access to anyone. Even if they aren't ready to handle it, it will have an effect on their spirit, which will assist in their 'future'. This material, which was on Val's site and is now here in Matrix V, is unique and the vast majority of the information has never appeared elsewhere. It is not in the interest of the Empire that you know these things for it is spirit, not body oriented. That this information is out now should tell you something about Earth's immediate future. Think on that. Question 4: First, I'd like to acknowledge the time & careful thought that went into these essays. I'm just curious why it sounds a lot like Old Testament God v. Satan in new clothing? Also, why these alien nations battling for us Earthers as slave labor & food sources haven't made themselves a little more obvious in doing so? Answer: It may sound like the OT to you because it's all a matter of perception. If it sounds like that to you, examine your background since it doesn't read that way to anyone else. The old testament god and sub-god (Satan) are both Orion/Sirian Empire personalities who are 375"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. part of the intra-empire struggles. The Empire considers Earth theirs as of its ancient claim. It’s similar to Europeans claiming American lands from the natives. History does repeat itself. They were very obvious and open in Earth's past (Pre-Atlantis, Atlantis and early post-Atlantis). Then infighting took them elsewhere while surrogates were left in charge (royalty). Get into David Icke's material for more of that. They also have considered it more effective to run Earth from behind the scenes in the past. This is planned to be changed to overt. Question 5: Perhaps you could explain exactly how we are food sources, and in what manner we are to be slave labor? Answer: The wording is quite plain...they eat humans as humans eat cows, fish, plants, etc. The whole concept of money is Orion Empire. It does not exist outside of the Empire. Humans were genetic-engineered to be laborers for the Empire. Whether it be manual or mental, you serve the Empire either covertly or overtly. Perhaps you are not ready to handle that at this time. Question 6: I would think, with the undertone of their superiority and technology, that it might be a minor matter for them to swoop in and do their deeds, rather than be the sublime, unseen forces of conspiracy to trick us into some dubious, cow-like submission or trick us into foolishly falling into an Evil trap, a la Satan of old. Answer: That is the way of the Sirians. Since they allied, under duress, with the Orion Empire who is into subterfuge as a preference for taking over low tech planets. The grey aliens (Sheti, in their language) are the surrogates for control on Earth and why they've been seen so much. Your way of conquest is Sirian, the overt falls to the far more clever Orion model. This doesn't mean military force isn't used by the Orion as they needed this to subdue Sirius. Something to keep in mind with the material I've released, it is for Dominant and Final Incarnations. Unless, and only you would know, that you are one of these, you will not be able to grasp the extent and full implications of the material. Hence you speak in biblical terms, which is comfortable with your level. Nevertheless, your Higher Self will be able to filter the material better than your conscious self. If you can't handle something, many things or everything, no problem. Just push it to the side and go on with your life. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 7: Wow! Thank you so much! I was struggling with the question of if I'm not a female and I'm not a male, what am I? Answer: Your spirit is now talking. It is NOT a male nor a female, but both male and female. Unfortunately in spoken word there is no PRONOUN for both. We have male-he, female-she and neither-it. That's because the Empire and the Dark never want you to discover who you really are. You are beating the Game when you realize you are neither gender. If you are your gender, that's your body speaking, not your spirit. 376"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"Question 8: I'm a female. I'm not straight, gay or bi. If I had sex I'd prefer it to be a man, I think. Answer: If you want to have sex and wanf it to be with the opposite gender (except for procreation), that's your body talking, not your spirit. Spirit is doesn't care one iota about the physical as a limitation. Question 9: Being in a female body, I'd have to say that the information you've provided that I'm absorbing, processing and assimilating about females makes me sad. And I wonder, if the percentage of women hip to this is so low, how can I be one of them? Answer: It's cold water in the face to see reality once you’ve been convinced that up is down, dark is light and so on. Many illusions have been exposed in what I've written. If the spirit is mature enough, it'll run with the info and begin (or continue) to dominate the body and its DNA commands to obey. If the spirit is mature enough, it will succeed and then it won't matter which gender one is in. Women enjoy the power, control and illusion they have in regard to men. It's Orion in nature and increasing. Power is a potent lure and Dark knows it. BUT in order to spiritually progress, one must give up the external power to dominate/control/transform others. Question 10: I'm working on those low self-esteem issues. I've always wondered why I couldn't get the goddess stuff to stick. Answer: That's because your spirit has matured enough to convey the fallacy of deities to your consciousness. Keep moving forward. As with all the information I've given, use it or push it aside. There are no commands here. The New Age religions are one of the latest tools of Dark and it's easier to be controlled if the controller is sugar coated. Also most New Age religions play up to the very false superiority complex of females, but that's the Orion way. Thanks for being the second female who has written in and comprehended the material.

Question 11: \"In practical application of extending my awareness out past physical, I experienced a connection to what I perceived as other sentient beings (multiple incarnations?) which resolved to something like an energy grid. My impression of this grid was that it mirrored/shadowed my thought form kind of like a parallel shape, and that it had a pleasant \"lifting\" and energizing effect which stayed with me until some time after returning to the body. (This was a bit different than the word/ picture/thought-touching type of contact that I've encountered as a psychic experience.) Am I generating this or attracting it?\" Answer: You are connected to all your incarnations as they are all you. Once you've reached a high enough spiritual maturity, you can have these other incarnations bleed through. Deja-vu is one indication of other incarnations. What you refer to as a grid sounds like you've touched your Higher Self which is the repository of ALL your incarnational experiences. Very good! You are neither generating or attracting it but rather accessing it. 377"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Question 12: \"I found your section on Minions all too accurate. I believe that I routinely experience genuine communication psychically with my animal companions (i.e. cats, birds, squirrels, etc.) in their animal forms than with these animal/human mutants you call minions. I didn't notice that you mentioned the role of the Orion/Sirian ETs in the other animals or plants on this planet.\" Answer: Earth, once discovered by the Empire, was used as a massive genetic experimentation lab. Many of the creatures today were thus created and serve no apparent purpose other than to cause misery for life forms, such as the mosquito. Some were brought from other planets and introduced to Earth. Many are native to Earth as well. Question 13: \"How does the gender polarity apply to these other earth residents, like the animals, fish and birds?\" Answer: Good questions. Gender polarity among animals/insects/fish is very 3rd density and meant to give the Ancient Earth humans a chance to observe both male and female aspects. Don't forget that the animal group soul is on a different path than those of 11s with a Higher Self. They are to experience things quite differently and serve another purpose. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 14: \"Hi. I'm still hazy about how we provide food for Them. If I heard about a constant and huge disappearance of people, that would clear things up (or do they use dead people like in the movie Phantasm?)\" Answer: The reptilians eat people as people eat fish, cattle and plants. It was no coincidence when, in the Reagan administration, that people were turned out and the homeless stuff began. This way people could disappear without anyone caring. Notice the missing people flier stuffed in your mail. Over 1000 people disappear in the US alone EACH WEEK. Some have met bad ends by Earth nuts, but most have met other ends including uses by the government (Montauk type, for one) and by the Empire. Question 15: \"I thought the male-female thing reflected the actual structures/unfolding of the cosmos?\" Answer: \"That is what the Empire and the Dark would have you believe, but in actuality, to be drawn into the gender Game, you are moving away from the spirit. The concentration here is to be Earth alone and incarnations here, and less concerned, at this time, of everyone else's. The development of Earth humans is unique and not the 'keeping up with the Joneses' of other systems. Question 16: \"... other than these queries I can relate to a lot of what is mentioned ............. from a strange kind of withdrawal from society, to synchronicities....increased magickal ability (manifestation of visualizations) ......... animals that seem damn human....the psi-connection with certain people, etc.\" Answer: Just don't forget, Higher Selves do NOT incarnate into animals (the big lie of Hindu reincarnation which is alien sponsored). You are much more likely to run into humans that seem damned animal! 378"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 17: \"I'm simply wondering where is the evidence for the \"female domination\" that is talked about in this material?\" Answer: \"That you are unable to see this evidence shows your body controls your spirit in this matter. That you are unable to see this is too basic to be addressed here. This material is for Dominant and Final incarnations. It is not debatable, as you seek to do, but is very plain for those advanced incarnations to see. You will be able to understand when you gain more control over the physical. Question 18: \"Backing those claims up with \"it's the Orion Queen model\" is rather empty in my opinion. Especially when this alleged Queen is still to be proven to exist, which doesn't make it very useful when making a point about this - better stick to observable facts for the majority of people.\" Answer: Now, who died and made you spokesman for 'the majority of people'? Again, I state this material is NOT for the majority of people for they are their body or are more than 50% controlled by their body. Your comments are pure of the body and of less than advanced spiritual development, which is OK, but is not addressed by this material which has plenty of caution and warning to those it is NOT meant for. Question 19: \"Also, concerning \"heterosexuality seen as a perversion of spirit.\" Wouldn't simply physical SEXUALITY be viewed as a perversion of the SPIRIT? Physical sexuality is of the body (whether you breed or not), so whether you are homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual you are still in the same frame of mind which is body oriented, and subject to much manipulation?\" Answer: Physical sexuality is spiritual expression in the physical. There is definite purpose in sex. The flaws and commands of body controlled sex have been covered elsewhere here. The incompatibility of the male/female genders have been touched on. Whether sex is body or spirit oriented depends on the maturity and control of the spirit. You will realize this in time when your spirit matures more. Meanwhile, deal with what you can here although you really aren't ready for most of it. Push to the side those things you can’t handle at this time. Question 20: \"I've read most of the books you've recommended, i.e., all of Monroe's works and David Icke's \"The Robot’s Rebellion\", as well as many other materials over the years (Richard Bach, Barbara Hand Clow, Barbara Marciniac, Robert Moody, James Redfield, etc.) some of a channeled nature, which feels right to me and wondered if your material is channeled (the above-referenced subject being the first I've read so far on this particular website) and, if not, where is this information originating?\" Answer: I recommend you also read David Icke's The Biggest Secret and watch Credo Mutwa's video (Vol 1 is best) where he's interviewed by David. My material is not channeled. Channeling is relying on external sources which has many problems. For one, even if the person is honest and real, how do you know the other spirit is what it says it is. Many reptilian 4th density beings love to play in channeling. My material can be found by anyone in the Library on Monroe level 27 (by anyone who can access the level) or within their Higher Self IF you are a Final Incarnation. Only a Final Incarnation has this complete access. 379"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Question 21: \"Secondly, I would like to ask where you see the Pleiadians fitting in to the scheme of things? Answer: There are MANY Pleiadians both good and bad and in-between. Some Pleiadians are responsible for some of the problems on Earth, having assisted the Empire. There is much written on the Pleiadians but it's all love & light stuff. This is polarity and not Balance. If you resonate to this, you are of the Light polarity. They are having their own experiences, but they are significantly different from those incarnating on Earth. Looking without will keep you from looking within. Question 22: \"My Spirit resonates more to these Beings than to anything else I've found, (with the exception of the 'elementals' which I've always believed existed albeit in another, close-by realm) but my mind still seeks answers and is concerned about being tricked .\" Answer: That's your Higher Self warning you not to be so enthralled by this realm. They have their own purpose and different path, by far. Enjoy them, but concentrate on your own growth. Don't give away your 'power' to them or to anyone else even the Pleiadians who you have on your personal altar. ALL deities have clay feet. Question 23: \"I have studied Ascension materials and pondered what my free Will choice would be; to go 'home' if, indeed, I come from the Pleiadies or elsewhere, or stay and fight the battle with the alien forces of Darkness and the New World Order to assist the Earth and the Spirits in reaching the 5th Density.\" Answer: Darkness hopes you battle them. They love battle. You will eventually move beyond polarity, but right now you're in the thick of it. Once you go within, instead of surrendering to without, you'll understand. Question 24: \"And what of the Anunnaki/Nephlim of Clow and Sitchin's works? Where do they fit in, if at all, in your estimation?\" Answer: Definitely NOT the 'good guys'. Question 25: \"You seem to indicate a Creator Spirit, aside from each individual's Higher Self. What is your concept of this Being?\" Answer: Everyone with a Higher Self IS the creator! It is a complex thought pattern, but one you will be better able to handle as your spirit advances. Question 26: \"Last, do you adhere to the concept that the Empire (Orion and/or Sirian beings) feed off of our fear, as well as our bodies?\" Answer: \"Those who feed off fear, hate and the negative emotions are 4th density reptilians. The Empire wants fear to feed it's kin on the 4th density and because fear stimulates a substance in your physical body that makes humans more tasty to them. They try and generate as much of this as possible before they eat them. You can read some of this in Icke's The Biggest Secret.

Question 27: \"What is the best way that one, who is not sure of what point they are at incarnation-wise, but definitely desires to advance towards balance, if not make the trip home altogether, can help themselves? I definitely agree that time is short and do desire to make the most of my experience here, what is left of it. I have availed myself of as much written and other published material as I can possibly find the time to digest. I am taking the recommendations and am in the middle of Monroe's three books. I have been a self- styled seeker for many years now starting with an interest in metaphysics and yogic practice and am now here at the web site absorbing the 'crash' material as I call it.\" Answer: That you really desire to progress is very positive. Reading Monroe’s trilogy and David Icke's The Biggest Secret (which I also recommend) will give you much information. As there is no one way of discovering who you really are, you need to trust in your Higher Self to bring the information you need to your attention. This could be through a physical teacher, books, videos, lectures, etc but it can also be through heightened intuition. One has to do away with external 'saviors' of all types: religion, aliens, polarity both Dark AND Light. You MUST look within. Open yourself to your Higher Self. Connect through your crown chakra. I suggest doing this every night before sleep. Think \"Connect to my Higher Self’. In most cases, it starts slowly, but you need to trust in you. You will get information that is just for you, for your experiences are what your Higher Self requires (which is the REAL you). Adapt what you learn to fit you. You wind up taking a bit from here and a bit from there and come up with something pretty unique FOR YOU. It may not work for anyone else or they may pick bits and pieces. Don't worry about not getting things right by comparing yourself to others. If it's right for you, it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks/does. Your desire to connect with your Higher Self is commendable. Continue the readings and go within trusting your Higher Self which can never lead you astray. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 28: \"This material has affected me pretty strongly. I can now see the Game for what it is. In the past I felt like I didn't have \"any game\" (powers of seduction) or that something was wrong with me. Combine that with being a Scorpio, and you get a very confused person. My only committed relationship ended in an ugly divorce, but under it all I felt that sex was a trap. I have been very wary of repeating this experience. I assumed it was because of some kind of fear of intimacy (psychobabble). I feel liberated but very sad at the same time. I feel no attraction for men, so close friendships are about as intimate as I get. It has been extremely difficult in the past coping with the social stigma of not being one of the \"beautiful people\". All part of being a final incarnation. I feel like I released all \"bad relationship\" karma when I divorced my wife. The planet has too many people on it as it is, so I am glad I have no children. My question is, \"Why the promotion of homosexuality by the mainstream media? Are gay people really outside of the Game?\" Answer: Gays are definitely NOT outside of the Game and they play it well. Gay and lesbian bodies simply mean the DNA command to force one to be with the opposite gender is shorted out. Other than the sexual orientation, gays are pretty much like anyone else. The media primarily, and before recently, has promoted heterosexuality. You can't turn on a tv or go to a movie where hets are not pushed as 'the accepted way'. The increasing failure of the DNA command to be with the opposite gender is a concern to the alien masters. This is one of the reasons they are considering wiping out the planet and re-engineering Earth humans with a better DNA command structure. One can have a gay/lesbian incarnation as a first incarnation or as a Final Incarnation or any number of times in-between. However it is 381"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"the SPIRIT that is what counts, not the physical. An immature spirit in a gay body can be a real “sex pig”, just as an immature spirit in a het body can be. An upper advanced spirit in whatever kind of body is not. It's always the physical trying to exert itself over the spiritual. Until the spirit is mature enough, the body will rule. Body rules include, getting married, breeding, disdain of homosexuality, concern over others' opinions, and so on. Even so, this is something ALL of us must progress through to get to the Final Incarnation. Bisexuality is the spirit struggling with the body for dominance. A Final Incarnation ONCE AWAKENED TO SHIMSELF (SHIM being the proper pronoun for both male and female in one being), will not marry nor have sex with the opposite sex. SHIM may choose not to have sex with anyone but self. Sex, at this stage, is something of the body UNLESS it is between very advanced spirits who wish to exchange energies. Back to media exposure of gays today. The aliens wish to divide the planet's population. They have succeeded with religion, race, politics and now are doing well with homosexuality. Forcing anyone to accept someone will strengthen the resolve NOT to accept. The bans against homosexuality are rooted in Orion and Sirian based religions - chrisitianity, muslim, etc. You have the POTENTIAL to discover your true spirit self in a gay body easier than in a het body. For the most part, old religion is a dinosaur slowly sinking into a tar pit. Hence the emergence of New Age religions. Remember, as per my writings, it is heterosexuality which is abnormal to spirit. The ist Law of Creation - Like attracts Like. There is no gender in the spirit world, so that makes gender the illusion, the lie. Think on that. Question 29: \"I have a new admiration for the bravery of gay people who stand in their truth, but it's not me. The body still has a say in what happens with its intense sexual desire, but I can control it. Self-control is one of the things I Am proud of about myself.\" Answer: As a Scorpio, you have tremendous control and tremendous passions. Since you are able to control it, your spirit has advanced beyond much of the body. You should be proud of your achievement. Don't conform. Don't worry about what others are doing. They are playing the Game. Question 30: \"I'd like to read more if it is available. There seems to be so much about the human experience that horrifies me when the information is processed. I get SO MAD sometimes. I want sex to be a form of divine union, but I AM alone in that, so I will be alone for the foreseeable future. This makes me sad, but I have the strength to carry on.\" Answer: That you can process any of the information I've written has unlocked several keys in discovering who YOU really are. Your Higher Self is pulling you to a higher purpose beyond the Game. Go within and see where you're lead and to whom you will meet. This doesn't mean the body or the Game has given up on you. They will come after you with a vengeance for daring to try and break away. Until they see you are really in control of the body, they will try and drag you back. Sex can be an exchange of energies between two advanced spirits who are aware, but with all the flaws purposely built into the physical bodies, it is counter productive to have sex with the opposite gender except to breed. Marriage in any form is not of the spirit, it's of the Empire. Two advanced spirits would live together, not breed and not get married. Unless/until you are an advanced enough or Final Incarnation, you will have trouble with that. Dominant Incarnations may choose to get married, however, as they have a different purpose. One can also be married when awakened to who they really are. If this happens, the marriage eventually ends because the M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge Internationa! Research Group.

All Rights Reserved. awakened one knows marriage is a trap and must progress. As I said in the beginning of my material, if you aren't a Dominant or Final Incarnation, you probably won't get it. Keep up your progress. You're on the right track. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 31: \"The development of Earth humans is unique and not the 'keeping up with the Joneses’ of other systems.\" Is Earth human's \"unique\" path of development one of enabling a much faster evolution of Spirit/Consciousness/Wisdom or is it something else you are referring to?\" Answer: Yes, Earth humans' path of development is unique. Robert Monroe first discovered that. Due to the extreme variety of experiences on Earth and the full range of emotions, those who accept the Game's challenge will advance FAR more rapidly than those who choose not to. Question 32: You said, \"Looking without will keep you from looking within.\" \"Darkness hopes you battle them. They love battle. You will eventually move beyond polarity, but right now you’re in the thick of it. Once you go within, instead of surrendering to without, you'll understand.\" From your perspective, what are efficient steps for accessing/going within? Answer: You must connect with your Higher Self. This is done through the Crown chakra. I recommend using the word 'connect' and visualizing a golden energy connecting you to your Higher Self. Always thank your Higher Self for information you’ve received and request more. Request you be exposed to what you need. Request the strength you need to control the body's pull to the Empire's commands. As long as your requests are to your Higher Self, you will do well. The information you get will apply to you, not necessarily to anyone else. Many paths for many Higher Selves, but there is the one for you. Question 33: \"Where does the Galactic Federation, the Blue Lodge of Sirius, Lord Surea, Lady Assyria and the Nine from the Blue Light of Creation (via Sheldon Nidle) fit in all of this? Answer: All the above exist to control those who would believe in external salvation. All of these will keep you from knowing who you really are. So, based on that, who do you think is behind them? Question 34: \"Hello— Loved your writings. Thank you for the information. A few thoughts—feel free to edit or delete before posting questions. I definitely feel this is a final incarnation—have most of my life. I have a male body. My sexual encounters would be considered bisexual by most people (never been an issue to me.) It never mattered that the partner was male or female. I recognized skin friction for what it was. One of the things that I continually remind myself of is the trap of making a personal preference for the molecular arrangement of things, people, etc. Esp, how that molecular arrangement appears visually. Now, here are my questions. We are to take responsibility for our creations. I have created a rather large monetary debt that I am contemplating eliminating through a bankruptcy. I am clouded on the issues of being responsible for my earthly creation. I mean, if my body were to die today, I wouldn't give it another thought and sure wouldn't come back for 383"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"another incarnation to work it out. (I don't buy into karma as a concept.) I also don't want to give the next 10 years of my life paying it off. Or do I? This is the quandary.\" Answer: This is easy to answer. ONLY in the Orion Empire does debt and currency exist. It was devised as a trap to make you a slave to the economy. Bankruptcy is a perfectly good way of eliminating debt you cannot afford. What you need to learn from this is not to repeat what got you into this type of debt again. Bankruptcy uses the system to defeat the system. Just don't get caught in the trap again. Using guilt is also part of the Game. Everything is just experience, no more, no less. Question 35: \"How does one deal with this (or any other) aspect of one's life when you know the GAME? What is responsibility? Where does this concept come from? Since it attempts to be guilt-based I have a good clue. Is my only responsibility to connecting to my Higher Self?\" Answer: The Game's purpose is like a maze. To get you so wrapped up in the Game that you pay little or no attention to the spirit. Once you recognize that you are not your body and you are here for experiences, then you know you're spinning out of the Game. Responsibility is to yourself, to mature spiritually and not repeating the same mistake over and over. The MANY traps placed here are alien based. Guilt comes from the controllers. It's like stepping into a bear trap and they complain you got blood all over it. If they didn't place the trap there in the first place.... Guilt is a prime control weapon. The Light polarity LOVES to use it. Guilt is to get you to conform. Now a maturing spirit knows if they caused an error, they apologize for it and refrain from repeating it. A spirit controlled person does not do murder/mayhem. Your prime responsibility is to your Higher Self. Anything that conflicts with this responsibility should be recognized for what it is. Question 36: \" What are you doing with your life other than researching and writing? What do you feel you have a \"responsibility\" to do, if anything, now that you know this is your final incarnation? Answer: I have a 'real' job, for one, but yet very few people want to be around me because I don't conform. You find this to be true as you are ready to depart the Game. A Final Incarnation sees the Game and its participants for what they are. It makes us quite uncomfortable. You'd have to spend time with me to know. My responsibility is to my Higher Self, to learn as much as I can and see what there is to see. Any more than this and I keep it to myself. Thanks for you comments.

Question 37: \"I've found that Qabalistic techniques, particularly those taught by Dion Fortune, have been very useful in contacting my Higher Self. I also think that the reptilian Illuminati have tried to contain these techniques for their own, hence the way that \"mystery\" teachings have always been available only to the priesthood and the \"initiated\" of their own caste. Were the elements of practical Qabalah appropriated by the reptilians, or did they originate the system?\" Answer: That you found techniques that help you connect with your Higher Self is wonderful. There are several mystery schools that have much truth in them. The Qabalah is from the Sirian oriented religion of the Jews, therefore it would be from the wolfish Sirians 384"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"rather than the Orion reptilians.

Question 38: \"As I was reading the material I wondered about the applicability of the Course on Miracles work which I read many years ago. Is it a path to discovering the spirit within us? From memory, it focused on our individual two selves Ego (physical) and Spirit (creation) and how the physical in this world had swamped and almost obliterated the true \"god\" connection. The work was about moving past the physical to the essence of being the true spirit again (to me it equates with the essence of your objective of reaching 95% ruled by the non-physical)?\" Answer: I've never read The Course on Miracles. However, these concepts sound valid. Question 39: I was wondering about the tie in between this material and other works such as the Sitchin earth chronicles. My perception is that his works ties in with what you are saying. As Nibiru is in the same solar system as earth it is more than conceivable that it too is/was controlled by Orion considering that our solar system is on the far outreaches of our galaxy. There is evidence that there was a battle between gods (good and bad) on earth, evidence of nuclear wars thousands of years ago and that Enki (from Nibiru or was it Orion?) was victorious. Although Sitchin hasn't said so, others believe that Enki was a reptilian god and perhaps it is not a stretch to say it was an Orion reptilian. I think Sitchin has been fairly persuasive in determining that Enki and his aides were involved in genetically engineering the human species as we know it today. I have read elsewhere that earth's inhabitants have been impacted by many extraterrestrials over the eons and some have impacted on our genes mainly through breeding and perhaps genetic engineering too.\" Answer : If you want to read more about the history of this solar system, I suggest reading Robert Morning Sky's LA Transcript. You'll get the Orion Empire view of this system and the genetic creating of humans. Just remember, it is the ORION viewpoint. There are errors within, but also much truth. Robert's material is strictly from the Orion standpoint. Question 40: \"It occurs to me rightly or wrongly that Adam and Eve story may signify the time when Adam was the original earth inhabitant who was both male and female and the \"making\" of Eve signifies the male/female separation.\" Answer: This is correct! Good for you. Question 41: \"According to Sitchin, Enki and others considered the existing Earth inhabitants unsuitable for their purposes of mining gold for Nibiru and proceeded to genetically manipulate the species. In order to keep the genetically modified Earth inhabitants under control certain genetic traits were implanted some of which probably relate to the traits you have mentioned as being Orion in females and Sirius in males. Something doesn't sit right in my mind with your comments on the different sexes regarding heterosexual and homosexual relationships. When we go back, humans were both sexes in one until the split and presumably their connection with the creator would have remained the same although influenced by genetic manipulation.\" Answer: The new 'creator' was Orion/Sirian genetics. This is part of the Dark plot. The new DNA commands, the chopping up of the DNA strands beyond 2 were all done on 385"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"purpose. Different races for different purposes, all to serve the Empire. There is no deity saying 'you can't do that'. It's all about experiences. Question 42: \"I can see how males and females while they are not aware and being together would make it more difficult for each to awaken (the plan- and maybe what you are saying). But to me if a spirit is awakened and aware and able to override the DNA influences then it should not matter whether it is in a male or female body or whether a heterosexual or homosexual relationship. In other words it is really the evolvement of the spirit rather than the sex which is the determining factor?\" Answer: Because of your points, well known to the genetic scientists, they placed chemical/electrical imbalances in the physical bodies that would reinforce the physical over the spirit in heterosexual couplings. Remember there were no homosexual couplings back then. That started with DNA command deterioration. The opposite gender will always exert a negative effect. Also gender is contrary to the 1st Law of Creation - Like attracts Like. If the spirit is advanced enough, it recognizes this and follows it. Yes to being friends with anyone (even the Orion queen, if she behaves), but, especially in the Final Incarnation, no to intercourse with the opposite gender once awakened to who you are. There is no need to stick your finger in a hot light socket when you know the danger. The danger here is the body will try to re-exert itself over the spirit. Question 43: \"As Sitchin has ably described, the planet Nibiru is in our solar system and, according to his deciphering, Nibiru returns approximately every 3600 years in its passage past earth and the other known planets in our solar system. It seems fairly supportable that each passage past earth has caused significant influences including pole shifts and the stoppage of earth's rotation for a short time with all the associated devastation. There seems to be evidence of such periods where it has been recorded that the sun stayed up for more than a whole day in parts of the world and in other parts the opposite. I am mentioning this because in your material you cover soon to come transformations where some spirits will leave this world (dimension) and other less developed spirits will find another world in which to continue their work. You also mention the possibility of cataclysmic events to happen on earth which may or may not coincide with these dimensional changes. A question which arose in my mind when I read Sitchins work on the return of Nibiru every 3600 years was- when does it come back again. His writings show evidence of more than one passage (perhaps one was the great flood) and the latest passage seemed to be around 1500 BC. It was somewhat surprising that I was led to the \"Zetatalk\" web site that actually puts a date on its return (around the middle of 2003) which makes sense give or take a few hundred years. It also talks, and has been for a number of years, about transformations, dimensional changes and the like as well as destruction of civilization as we know it; a theme similar to many others (Hopi's for example) and in your material too. Could this be the harbinger of what is to come?\" Answer: Yes. Nibiru is known as \"the Eye of God\". It destroyed Maldek and made it the asteroid belt of today. Nibiru is an artificial planet (similar to the Moon) and is basically a warship on LONG patrol. It is similar to the Death Star of Star Wars, but has the outer appearance of a planetoid. The Sirian Empire was the one to develop this type of device and actually tried invading the Orion Empire with it. They did not succeed. Much of the natural phenomena is Earth reacting to the unfavorable goings on on SHIM's surface, especially the mass incarnating of group souls into human bodies.

Question 45: \"Greetings, I read your work and was impressed. I am trying to ascertain what stage of incarnation I am in. I intend to keep working on this by accessing Val's site and looking into Focus 12 and trying to access the Library on any Monroe level I can get to. I'm also going to get the Matrix series and start reading. Although I may not be completely there, I definitely don’t want to \"play The Game\", and have no interest in breeding. Is it possible I'm in my Dominant or Final Incarnation? Answer: Yes, but ONLY you can say so. This information comes from your Higher Self and no one else. Good for you! Question 46: \"One more piece of info - I'm thirty years old now, and ever since I was about 23, I've experienced hundreds of synchronicities, seen a few visions, and I can feel all kinds of psychic energy in my body and brain, including sensations in all chakras, including 3rd eye and crown chakra. I can control the energy, increase it, decrease it, redirect it, cause and sometimes cure my own headaches or other bodily problems. The sensation is amazing and can be very intense. In fact, I've had experiences where every cell in my body is charged with this sensation, and it seems that my body is being \"occupied\", which I've attributed to being my sensing of my astral form. All this is great and very interesting, but I don't seem to be able to do anything practical with any of it. I go through days of experiencing 5 or 6 \"miraculous\", \"unexplainable\" synchronicities in one day, and then just have to sit and ponder, while still being essentially powerless. So, if you have the time, can you shed light on what you think this energy may be, and what level of evolution or incarnation you think I may be at?\" Answer: You are sensing and using your spirit, your true self energy but your 'powerless' comment says you haven’t developed enough control as of yet. We can do AMAZING things when aware, mature and controlling of our spirit selves. This is what the Dark/ Light/ Orion/Sirians fear. A planet where mature spirits are in control is able to repel alien ships just by thought alone. Think on that. Only you can determine what level you are. This is through your Higher Self. Your physical will still try to resist and pull you back. Never get overconfident either. Question 47: \"Also, any other advice you may have would be most helpful.

I'd really appreciate it!\" Answer: My best advice is read Monroe's trilogy, Icke's \"The Biggest Secret\" and even Morning Sky's \"LA Transcript\". These give you a great foundation and Morning Sky gives you an Orion perspective (the Orion reptilian queen is goddess incarnate type stuff). With these you can see the Game.

M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Range of Responsibility to Ones Children Question 48: \"I have been dabbling in different information for years in an attempt to find my true self. I have read some of the things you said about reproducing and I totally understand and agree. I am pregnant (and am due any day now). What are our responsibilities to the children we have already produced? Can these children impede our connection with our higher self? Answer: Your responsibilities are to raise them the best you can. You made a choice to have children, so you are responsible to follow up with their development. ANY 3rd density distraction can impede spiritual matters, but in order to defeat the Game, we must all pass through its trials. Breeding is one of them. You are still at that stage. It's not something that can be avoided in most het bodies. You will have to use your free time to connect with your Higher Self, but, at least until the children you chose to breed are adults, your prime responsibility is to them. Question 49: \"Is an example of females tapping into their male spirit exhibited by the documented cases of so called \"virgin births\"? Answer: 'Virgin births' are a creation of religion. Some so-called 'virgin births' are because of alien or secret government insemination unaware to the female. Question 50: \"During the gestation process, in the first trimester humans have an extended tail/coccyx and gills giving them the appearance of reptilians...in the second trimester they have the proportionately large head, and eyes giving them the appearance of the greys and in the 3rd trimester they have the fur and general appearance of the modern homo-sapien. Do you feel these characteristics exhibit the obvious genetic tampering of humans by multiple species of beings extra to terra (extraterrestrial)? Answer: Yes, and also an embryo will take on female characteristics before male. Hence the joking comment about 'if a female child is born, put it back in...it's not finished'. Question 51: \"What is your opinion on the statement that the Annunaki originally created the Greys?\" Answer: What you refer to as Sitchen's \"Annunaki\" is actually the Orion Empire. They have genetically engineered more than one Grey alien race, called the Sheti. They worked for the Orion Empire, but joined, at least in this solar system, with the rebel elements, the rebel queen. Both elements are equally disdainful of Earth humans. Question 52: \" I do thoroughly understand that there has been so much genetic manipulation/mixing etc. of many species both on and off this planet (ex. certain Anunnaki were mixed species like Murdoq/Marduk (Reptilain/Anunnaki-rizqiyian) and Enqi Reptilian Annunaki- Rizqiyan) and that one cannot simply lump a group of beings into one category without knowing all of the details of the genetic history, etc...however I just want some feedback on certain issues.\" 388"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"Answer: Read Robert Morning Sky's LA Transcript for more details on genetic manipulation of Earth.

You do not \"control\" emotions, you simply identify them for what they are....as you said, emotions are an important part of this existence. However, to control emotions is not what a person should do...one should learn to react according to the intellect of the \"higher self' but not \"control\" the emotions, you simply channel the emotion in a more useful way?\" Answer: To be in control of your emotions is NOT to be a Vulcan from Star Trek. It is to control them rather than they control you. What you stated above IS control of emotions. When emotions control you, you're carried away on the whims of the physical. To be in control of emotions is not denial of them, but constructive use of them. Question 54: \"On the nature of a being becoming \"both” male and female or one.

You cannot trap ONE. Answer: For one, you are thinking ‘one’ as a third density limitation. It is not. You are trying to apply 3rd density thinking to beyond 3rd density matters. This cannot be done. This is too heavily left brain logic/science. You cannot translate everything from the higher levels to 3rd density terms. There are concepts that have no English word to relate, as Val knows from what I've told him. Drop the scientific analysis and just experience.

Answer: Your death was chosen by you before birth. There is no such thing as premature death. You will not leave an incarnation before you have completed everything necessary for that incarnation to learn/experience. Your Higher Self also is not complete until a Final Incarnation.

Some are indeed interested in assisting, but the Empire has its eye out for these groups. Also, those in political control of Earth are under the control of various Dark alien groups who have killed beneficial aliens who they catch on or approaching Earth.

The accumulation of experiences, personalities and emotions of all your incarnations becomes the real you with the Final Incarnation the pilot and combination of all. What the Handbook refers to as your 'soul' is your Higher Self. Question 63: \"What about the group of SHIM that reach immortality—were they final incarnates, or just had the will to do it?\" Answer: SHIM is a pronoun referring to a spirit. It cannot be correctly used as a noun. Correct phrase for your question, \"What about the group of spirits (or Higher Selves) that ....\" The Final Incarnation, once the Final Incarnation is complete, becomes the Higher Self and moves on to the next level where new and far different experiences are encountered. You need the total experiences of 3rd density existence to enter that area. When you reach Final Incarnation, AND BECOME AWAKENED TO IT, you will understand what I mean. This cannot be forced or induced before it is time. Meanwhile, learn and continue to explore and experience. Question 64: \"I am writing from Italy and I would like to share that to me physical sexual interaction with one’s own self or another SHIM (being of the same gender) is very fine and enjoyable, so do you agree that sex can be exciting even if your purpose is to become wholly independent from the body and to increase its vibrational frequency in order to unfold our unlimited potential and \"ascend\" so to say, or if you prefer, to let our whole spirit \"descend\" more fully into the body? Answer: I must correct you on the use of SHIM as a noun. It is a pronoun like he, she & it. SHIM cannot be used on current Earth genders. It could be used as a pronoun for Ancient Earth humans who, like Earth SHIMself, was a spirit in a combination male/female body. As long as you are in a male or female body, you are either he or she, NOT SHIM. Once vou leave the body, vou are SHIM. Sex, apart for breeding purposes, is only a shadow of what can be when 2 spirits meld. It isn't that you want the spirit to descend more into the body, it can't. What you should try to do is strengthen the connection between you in the body and your Higher Self through the Crown chakra. Connect and strengthen the flow of control to bring the body in line with the objectives of the Higher Self. 391"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"Question 65: \"Do you agree that, even if you don't know too many things about what is really holding us back, we can just follow our inner joy and instinct which is our spirit talking to us? Is this enough to override the body limitations?\" Answer: There is no need to look for a script. Enjoy your incarnation and your experiences. As you mature spiritually, you will be able to know when it is the body talking or the spirit.

Question 66: \"Thank you so much for your answers, I would like to ask: is the Higher Self the part of the Creator or Isness in us, and why do we call it \"higher\", isn't all of what we are just SELF, part of us? Isn't ALL just ISNESS? Answer: 'Isness' is one of the most inappropriate word I've ever heard. It's cumbersome and just doesn't fit. Whoever came up with that one w-as off the mark. EVERYTHING is part of the whole, the Creator. It is the Higher Self because SHIM resides in a higher vibration. The Higher Self is the repository for ALL your experiences and the vehicle the Final Incarnation uses to advance to even higher vibrations. Concern should not dwell on the mechanics of the universe as this is not the purpose of current incarnations. There will come a time in one's progression where you will learn much more on this. Question 67: \"I guess that each one of us has their own personal path, but is there a common way we could more easily and consciously access our \"Higher Self' and the information \"SHIM\" holds for us? Answer: Read the other answers I've given. I have already answered a similar question. Keep up your progress. Question 68: \"I understand that humor is a key to accessing the higher self and that nothing should be taken as too seriously as you stated in your posting, so as a final incarnation moves on to new experiences, how would humor begin to change or express itself?\" Answer: By understanding that NOTHING is 'sacred' and that so-called 'sacredness' is of the body. Once you're here, you look at the oh-so-serious, body oriented concerns as illusion and see the humor in it. Topics such as religion, death, body parts and functions are all things the body considers 'sacred'. They are not. Once you realize you are immortal and the body is simply a vehicle for you to experience 3rd density, you really do see the humor in the illusions the body has created. Yes, this is due to input from the Orion and Sirian Empires (note that violence is ok, but using colorful words, such as 'fuck', are not). Let nothing hold you back. Once you've started changing, others’ bodies will try and drag you back...'you can't say/do/be that', 'that's sacred', 'don't be blasphemous', etc. Apart from humor with the non-existent body 'sacredness', your humor will be needed in dealing with higher dimension beings. A serious, somber person wouldn't do well on higher dimensions. Higher dimension beings are very enjoyable with excellent senses of humor. This makes your aura shine, rather than the restricted aura of the all business types. Any more information that this on this topic will have to wait until you reach that level and experience it for yourself. 392"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"Question 69: \"Since HIV/AIDS is an autoimmune disorder (meaning your body’s immune system is broken down and aiding bodily demise instead of properly defending the body), and many Earth humans are reflectively an autoimmune disorder to Earth (meaning many Earth humans are attacking this aware planet instead of protecting it), can one prevent HIV/AIDS infection in their physical body simply by connecting with the higher self and also opening up to the reality that this planet is an aware entity to be respected? In other words will a person NOT get AIDS/HIV simply by being in tune with nature or is the only safe thing for people to do is to only have sex with themselves (masturbate)?\" Answer: You can find information on Val's site dealing with what AIDS is NOT. It is not caused by HIV, but by the destruction of the immune system and the drugs that assist this destruction. Once someone who believes that HIV causes AIDS is told he or she has it, they begin to die because they believe it. Refer to Val's material or ask him about further on that phase. There are those who chose to experience this event and will. Remember everything's experience. The way of death was chosen just as gender is chosen. You must overcome this fear. Safe sex is the way to go mainly because using condoms can prevent true STDs. Don't be paranoid, but do be cautious. Being in tune with nature will not prevent a chosen destiny, chosen before incarnation. Being in tune with your Higher Self will lead you to where you should go and what you should do. Question 70: \"You stated that final incarnations will not have children because it is a drain on their creative energy?\" Answer: Not quite right. AWAKENED Final Incarnations will not have children. It is possible to be a Final, not yet awakened, and have children. In this case, one must raise them properly. Once the children become adults, you will then be free to explore. An AWAKENED Final Incarnation will not want more children, in that case. Question 71: \"Are there planets consisting of all \"final incarnations\"? Answer: I don't know about that. If so, the whole planet's population would vanish at the deaths of the people. I guess it's possible. I just don’t know. Question 72: \"If so, how would they continue producing bodies for spirits to incarnate into? Is it done through cloning and growing the necessary body in the laboratory?\" Answer: Go back to the Ancient Earth human material. They weren't Final Incarnations, but the population was VERY low compared to today. Most didn't reproduce, however they did when they felt it was necessary. The worrying about reproducing is an Orion DNA command, not of the spirit. Spirit controlled bodies do not worry about reproduction. The process of cloning bodies is also Orion in nature. The Orion queen has been cloning herself for millennia. The Sheti (Greys) are also cloned. They fear not being on 3rd density. You'll have to ask them what their fears are, but I doubt they'll tell you. Again, body focus is Orion. There is abundant life without breeding like roaches for all Higher Self spirits who wish to incarnate.\" Question 73: \"As a spirit gains mastery over the physical dna programming, can the forces which hold the atoms of the body together be consciously transformed allowing the spirit to utilize whatever vehicle is necessary (ex...transforming the body into a living, aware matrix MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

With Earth humans, the Orion genetic scientists destroyed that ability. This destruction is seen by us only having 2 strands of DNA instead of 12. The so-called 'junk DNA' we carry is the remnants of the other 10 strands. For Earth human bodies to do what you say requires the full 12 strands. This is contrary to the Orion will. They don't want us doing that. BUT, you can astral travel which is other dimensions. Identify with the spirit, not the body. Remember, the body is simply the vehicle for the spirit.

Question 74: \"I had a few queries come to mind about minion spirits and the associated traits described in the material. After a minion spirit incarnation ends (the human body dies), will the soul return to the animal group soul, or will it seek additional human incarnation experiences (or is it a toss-up between these options?)\" Answer: Robert Monroe correctly describes, in his book, about what happens to some of the minion spirits after death. It's probably in his first book, Journeys Out Of Body, where Robert discovers this ball of people trying to have sex. He pulls one out and tries to talk to him, but notices the ,blank look on the face. That's an animal group soul spirit. Read Monroe's trilogy. When the minion spirit dies, it does not immediately return to the group soul. The human imprint must fade before the group spirit remembers what it is and returns, which is winking out from that area and returning to where it belongs. It will not seek out additional human experiences as this is not its purpose. That would be like you trying to incarnate as a rock. It's not your purpose. Question 75: \"I agree that the Hindu idea of people reincarnating as animals is non-sense (unless one considers various people as unprepared for human incarnation as you describe), as it is comparable to sending a student who flunks a grade in school back to repeat a previous grade they already successfully completed. More comments?\" Answer: Although with the hindus, it's not flunking and repeating, although that's what they preach. It's returning to the incarnational path the group soul belongs on. Hindus do not accept converts. You are either born one or you are not. That’s also a shadow of the animal group soul. Look at hindu deities too and what do you mostly see? Animals, like Ganesh the elephant deity. They know they are not supposed to be where they are, but the breeding like roaches continues. Question 76: \"Although you have singled out certain groups as examples of how minion spirits manifest in society (Police Officers/Military, PETA/Vegetarians), it seems from your statements that MOST people born are now minion soul incarnations, so you would find this situation in any segment of society?\" Answer: You are correct. This is also a Dark plan. Dark can control a minion incarnation, but it cannot control awakened or awakening Higher Selves. Question 77: \"Anyway, I'm curious about how soul memories from incarnations on other planets might affect one's approach to Earth life. For example, if someone had incarnated 394"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"on the planet with Alex Collier's Andromedans, would they be peaceful, freedom-oriented, and inclined to eat simple vegan food?\" Answer: As our concern is to be Earth, 'what might be on other planets' is not the point. It's the spirit that counts and NOT the body. Collier says he was an Andromedan now born on Earth. Well, the Earth body overwhelmed his spirit and he's fallen into the same mess as everyone else. This is why Earth incarnations can propel the Higher Self to far greater levels by succeeding than incarnations elsewhere. Yeah, the Andromedans can be all preachy but they don’t have Earth physical bodies. Throw them in one then watch what happens. No, if you want safe incarnations, go Andromedan. If you want rapid progression, go Earth. Question 78: \"If someone had incarnated on Alpha Draconis previously, would they be inclined to be ritualistic and domineering?\" Answer: Remember in my materials, I’ve said how Orion and Sirius placed DNA commands in the Earth body. This includes the traits you mentioned. We have the reptilian part of the brain. Guess where that came from. The traits you listed are of the body, of minion and lower through mid incarnational levels. It is RARE to find one incarnating from one planet to another where the differences are so radical. They tend to stay where they are. That's why the Andromedans reborn have all their memories and continue in a new body. It's just a vehicle. The Orion reptilians also want to stay where they are. Question 79: \"When doing past-life regressions with minion-soul individuals, will they recall a lifetime as an animal?\" Answer: I don't know. I doubt these people would want past life regressions. That's a concern of Higher Selves. Question 80: \"I've been told that a certain amount of people tend to be unable to regress to past lives, and that these can typically be identified by looking at their eyes (windows to the soul, I presume). Does this mean that these people are minion spirits? If so, the percentage of people who can’t be memory-regressed is pretty low compared to the amount of minions you say are incarnated?\" Answer: You can be on a first incarnation and have no past lives. Minion spirits tend to have flat eyes. Trying to distinguish minion incarnations from low level incarnations is not always easy. It gets easier with advancement and is not difficult for a Final Incarnation. But then a Final Incarnation is interested more in the end of the experience than pointing fingers at all the minions. Refer to my last remarks for your last comment. Question 81: \"Could it be that people in the regression therapy sample population are more likely to be higher self incarnations and not representative of the general population?\" Answer: You have answered your own question. Question 82: \"Also, are there certain geographic regions with especially high percentages of minions (such as India, China, Africa)?\" Answer: Yes, all the above, but not restricted to them. America has loads of minion spirits, but of course in immense populations like India, you have even higher percentages.

I guess the various races that have done genetic tinkering with Earth humanoids have had a variety of appetites! What diet were the original bi-gender Earther bodies designed for?\" Answer: The Ancient Earth humans were big on nuts, berries, etc. They were not meat eaters. That was introduced by the Orion and Sirian genetic scientists. We are what we are physically. Question 84: \"Do you think a mainly vegetarian diet has any benefits for raising one's vibratory rate and maintaining physical health while incarnated on Earth?\" Answer: I know at the Monroe Institute, when I went there several times, it was a no-meat week. However Monroe himself loved eating meat and look what he accomplished. The current physical body does require an omnivore’s variety. The problem is that the government has polluted the meat as well as the vegetables and fruits we eat. Organic meats/fruits /veggies are best. A strict vegetarian diet on the current human body can have negative effects in the long run. However do what you feel you must. Everyone's path is their own and very individual. Question 85: \"Also, I'd think that more evolved souls would be less attached to physical appetites, and therefore would be more inclined to reduce or eliminate meat-consumption when recognizing that the suffering resulting from slaughter is an evolutionary experience they no longer need to participate in. In essence, I'm suggesting the possibility that vegetarianism could be associated with various soul groupings, including herbivore minion souls, radical \"light-workers\", \"star seeds,\" and even final & dominant incarnations. I may also just be seeking additional insight into my own path, which has included vegetarianism throughout this lifetime. Answer: Advanced incarnations will likely seek to reduce meat consumption. Whether one chooses to eliminate it is strictly an individual choice and not a 'you gotta'. Those who preach vegetarianism, as you are, above fall into the herbivore line of thinking. Coating it as you did falls into a non-existent one path way. If a Final or Dominant Incarnation chose to be vegetarian, it's for their individual experience, not a better way. Those who condemn meat eating do not understand the purpose of the animal group soul, the nature of Earth human bodies and the understanding of experiences. For if you are wrapped up in the physical, you will not gain full understanding of the spiritual. That you have chosen vegetarianism is fine for you, but you alone. Conformity is of the body and also of the Empire. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 86: \"Information has trickled from Val's site and other avenues into my awareness for a while now, long enough that the puzzle of thousands of pieces has as a function of its intrinsic intelligence begun to correlate itself. Would it be a good fit to summarize that in the beginning was a word, idea, plan, to promulgate a conspiracy to create a paradigm, one at odds with the evolutionary sweep and ascendancy of the nature kingdoms, one which would transfigure every human from a divine life-emanating spark into a black hole?\" 396"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"Answer: I don’t believe this to be true. The origin was for experience, nothing more, nothing less. Conspiracy is a polarity issue, both Dark and Light.

Question 87: \"The current cover of Discover magazine asks whether parasites rule the world. So much more is known now about the truer identity and origin of the Oz's Wicked Witch of the West.

I was also wondering about dominant/or final incarnations responsibility to other dom./fm. incarnations that may be stuck. Hmmmmm. Responsibility may be a bad word.\" Answer: Yes, you’re getting into the ’can I save someone’ area. This is a Light polarity issue. Dominant incarnations have varied experiences and you must access your Higher Self to find out more about YOUR individual Dominant incarnations and where you fit. Final Incarnations are a whole other matter with complete access to the Higher Self. Dominant incarnations do not have this access. Final Incarnations have significant input from Dominants, but then exceed their abilities. You may have agreed to assist another spirit, BUT this is not the same as ’saving’ them. If you are more advanced, you can share what you’ve learned but are cautioned against trying to convince them. It is up to them to take the info and run with it. This is why I answer questions but never debate or justify what I’ve learned. This is a Balance issue. Only a Final Incarnation has the potential to reach Balance. The balancing of one’s Dark and Light polarities is NOT Balance. They are both different, significantly. Which is why Balance is so difficult for those not in it to understand, You 'owe’ nothing to anyone, but you may choose to provide some assistance. If they respond, you can provide more. If they reject your assistance, you have to let them go and find themselves. Question 89: \"Do you have knowledge of the events that are to supposed to unfold in the next year and beyond until 2012, and if so, are you at liberty to comment on them?\" Answer: It's not events that are SUPPOSED to happen, but rather events others are planning on happening. There are many wild cards and it will be interesting to see which one gets played first. Question 90: \"Does a final incarnation imply natural psychic abilities or is it just an aspect that is not really relevant to levels of incarnation?\" 397"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"Answer: You can have far more psychic oriented incarnations than the Final, most likely a Dominant incarnation at the very least. The Final will have a more sophisticated ability rather than the crowd dazzling, look-at-me versions in lesser incarnations. There are some things people will not be able to grasp until the Final incarnation. You'll know what I mean when you arrive there. Final incarnations are very unique to each Higher Self. Question 91: \"Finally, where do you get your information from primarily? I'm especially curious about the Sirian/Orion scenario. I’m aware of the reptilian issue mostly through David Icke's work but the Sirius one (origin of the werewolf stories??) is rather new to me. Any idea where I could get more info on this Sirian aspect? Answer: ALL the 3rd density information can be located in the Library on Focus level 27 (Monroe). You can access this plus more within your Higher Self. To read more on Sirius and Orion, see Robert Morning Sky's LA Transcript. It is full of Orion and Sirian propaganda, but also lots of information. Use discernment when reading. Morning Sky also had a lot of Orion material in his Volume 2, but this is no longer available. Guess it had too much info and was making the lizzies nervous back home in Mintaka. I had to check up on which was fact and which was propaganda. As for other than 3d information, it comes from higher densities available to awakened Final Incarnations. There's nothing I've revealed that everyone with access to their Higher Self can't find out on their own.

Question 92: \"Having read the works of David Icke, I was particularly interested in this material. My question is this: If the reptilians and Sirians were already split into separate genders (the Reptilians have their Queen, the Sirians their King), and the combining of genders is God's perfect form, how did these two groups become split, and wouldn’t they have naturally wanted to create a similar type of split entity on earth? Perhaps they viewed the combined gender as very unnatural. Thanks\" Answer: You must first realize that not all life and forms of it are uniform on the 3rd density nor are they expected to be. Conformity is not the way of the spirit but rather the way of the body. Next, the line that 'man was created in the image and likeness of god' is pure genetic tampering. They took Earth human, which was perfect for 3rd density, tampered with it and then created genders in the image and likeness of the alien genetic scientists, both male and female. The current human body is NOT \"the image of the Creator\" and not even the image of a disincarnate spirit. The natural shape, as seen by looking at the Higher Self from the outside, is oval and a pure energy being. The incarnation into Ancient Human form was for the Higher Self to experience 3rd density life. The creation of the reptilian race (the oldest race in 3rd density by far) is not our concern at this point of our progress. If you seek that knowledge, the true knowledge of it, it will come to you when you're ready. Robert Morning Sky had given the Orion version of the creation of the reptilian race in his no longer available Book II. Concentrating too much on the external will keep you from where you should concentrate, the real you, your own Higher Self. Once you have connected to your Higher Self and discovered where you are in your incarnational line, then you can branch outward with a totally new perspective. Until you do connect, your perspective is flawed by your body, genetics, DNA programming, etc. What the Orion and Sirian Empires thought of Ancient Earth humans is irrelevant. They are operating under a Dark polarity plan. They tampered with something they shouldn't have. Select Higher Selves took up the challenge and here we are. The abomination comes from the Dark splitting Earth humans into genders.

Question 93: \"Would you say that our astrological birth charts are a statement of what we choose to experience in this incarnation? Is there any validity in astrology. Thank you.\" Answer: Yes, your individual horoscope includes all the experiences you have chosen plus many you didn't but are wild cards in your incarnations. The key to an accurate horoscope is the time of birth. If the time is off, your horoscope has inaccuracies. The greater the amount of time error, the greater the inaccuracy. Astrology is totally valid and is used on other systems. The Pleiadians of planet Erra have referred to the use of astrology by Semjase who was Edward Meier’s long time contact. Astrology is difficult to learn, but invaluable to those who know how to read it.

One more - you have mentioned the light trap and received much interest from many. I couldn't help but think of all the work Danion Brinkley has done to promote \"going into the light\". Comments? Answer: Integrating the polarities is something for the Final Incarnation to accomplish. Balancing them in a yin-yang picture is done first and can be achieved by Dominant Incarnations. Your Higher Self will guide you in these. Since all paths are different, the methods used can also be different even though the goal is the same. \"Yin-yanging\" the polarities is one thing, but integrating them into Balance is something else. It alters your perspectives and has many benefits needed in higher dimensions. For more on this, you must deal with the real you, your Higher Self. As for those who push going into the ’light’, many are indeed sincere and well intentioned. But then the road to hell is paved with good intentions. It's where they're at. It's what the Dark masters want you to believe. Robert Monroe was the first one to tell me personally about the false 'light'. Val has it in Matrix II. I've done my own investigations on the astral. Where will your path take you? Only your Higher Self can say. Question 95: I have a question as it relates to moving on and the monastic life. In moving on, spiraling out as you (and others) have termed it, one drops the need for male female relationship, relationship period, the need for Sex, and being young, etc. Answer: The need for sex is something of the physical and it is a necessary part of the physical experience, even if only self-sex. In order to maintain properly working systems, one should not go dormant. While there is no \"need\" for a relationship once the spirit is in control, and definitely NO marriages - het or gay - someone can meet a kindred spirit to share a life with. This is fine as long as they are growing together. Once one stops or goes to a different path, you can't allow that to side track you, and therefore a parting of the ways is strongly suggested. Definitely the need to appear young is of the body. The dyes, make-ups, glitters and sparkles all conceal who you really are and make one body centered. That's part of the Dark's plan. Question 96: Where and how does the monastic life fit into this. Is this another kind of relationship (one we perhaps also do not need) but in the form of one with \"God\" or all that 399"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"is if you want to call source something else. The name really matters not. In many of these sorts of relationships there is as much attachment to doing service and God as in any other earth like relationship. Answer: There are different types of monastic life. If it is to be a servant of the non-deity 'god', then it's a false life. If it’s a life a service to others, it's a Light side polarity existence. One must examine who the master is in this life and the purpose. Question 97: I am also aware of something more and that is what speaks to me. I suspect that it is from another incarnation living this life in some form, but it continues to call to me, more strongly as I get older. It is not the dedication to a \"God\" of some sort that I am seeking by living this life but instead a quest, or deep thirst if you will for knowledge, something that is enhanced when one detaches from the \"things\" of this world and goes inward. Answer: The call to dump much of the Game is of one's Higher Self. If the person is spiritually mature enough, SHIM can overrule the body, as long as one doesn't deny the body everything, it won't break down. Question 98: I wonder what your travels in this level 26 reveal to you of this sort of life. I note that you have commented on various lifestyles and relationships but I do not see this one mentioned. Priest, nun, monk or otherwise. Incidentally the monk is the one that calls to me the most. Perhaps knowledge is my addiction. Answer: All these lives are of the service (in the US) to the never-was Christian god. If you are into religious service, especially of one of the one-god religions, you have not advanced enough spiritually. Praying to non-existent deities will get you nowhere. When you realize the lies of religion (read: The Christ Conspiracy by Acharya S.), you will want nothing to do with it or its trappings (religious orders). All these vocations are polarity and counter to advanced spiritual development. Remember, the more spiritual you get, the less religious. That knowledge is your addiction is fine. The pursuit of knowledge is best found when you are free to do so at your speed and level. The life of a monk reeks of religious bounds, but if this is where you are pulled, you will discover that on your own. Do what you feel you must.

Question 99: A couple of times you mentioned that Robert Monroe gave you instructions on how to connect to your higher self. Exactly what are the instructions? Answer: Unless you have taken at least Gateway, in residence at Monroe's Institute, it would not make sense to you. All I can tell you otherwise is go within yourself and seek your Higher Self. Question 100: I know that we are to stay focus on creating the new paradigm—but when 51/2 billion people starts to die off—some of these are going to be your family, friends etc. What to you tell them, \"tough shit\" your SHIM wants to experience victim hood, see you around? Answer: Pretty much. That you identify with the body indicates you are not yet spirit connected. Those who are “spirit-connected” realize what the body is and that the spirit is immortal.

Question 101: Can the concept of “soul mates” apply to minion incarnations? Answer: I received a catalog from Salem, MA which has 2 ceramic pins. One has a woman with a cat and the other has a woman with a dog. Beneath the figures are the words \"soul mates\". This IS a correct illustration of the term WHEN THE FEMALE DEPICTED IS A MINION INCARNATION. As all minions are from the nature spirit group soul, a nature spirit in a human body IS the soul mate of an animal as when the minion spirit incarnations die, the spirit returns to the nature spirit group soul, both the cat or dog and the female (in the illustrated case). Keep this in mind when tossing about, or hearing the all-too-overused phrase \"he/she's my soul mate\". Question 102: Is there a method that you personally use to connect to your Higher Self? Answer: If you have been unable to connect with your Higher Self as you would like to, you may like to use these meditation keywords I've developed and use myself. Using your chakras is a good way to stimulate connections with your Higher Self. Always start at the crown chakra and work your way down through all 7. Crown: CONNECT - 'Increase and expand connection to my Higher Self is the thought. 3rd Eye: SEE and this refers to seeing clearly. Throat: HEAR what you need to hear. Heart: FEEL, this chakra is important for this. Solar Plex: DEFEND - keep those defenses up! Genital: CREATE and this doesn't mean, in the current time, wasting it on creating new physical bodies for minions to incarnate in. Of course, if you are not a Final or very advanced incarnation, you'll be body lead and not spirit lead. Create is for ideas, art, etc. Base: ENERGIZE - With this feel the base chakra energizing all the other chakras in a clockwise motion from base up to the crown. After this, surround yourself in a golden eggshell of energy to enhance this meditation and assist in protection from polarities. Whereas this works fine for me, don't feel that you have to use this form. Use what works for you. I'm sharing what works for me. The crown chakra CONNECT is most important, though, as you seek to strengthen and increase the connection between incarnated spirit and the Higher Self for direction and assistance. Your Higher Self is the ONLY totally reliable source for you. Question 103: A couple of times you mentioned that Robert Monroe gave you instructions on how to connect to your higher self. Exactly what were the instructions? Answer: Unless you have taken at least Gateway, in residence at Monroe's Institute, it would not make sense to you. All I can tell you otherwise is go within yourself and seek your Higher Self. 401"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"Question 104: I know that we are to stay focus on creating the new paradigm—but when 51/2 billion people starts to die off—some of these are going to be your family, friends etc. What do you tell them? \"Tough shit\" your SHIM wants to experience victim hood, see you around? Answer: Pretty much. That you identify with the body indicates you are not yet spirit connected. Those who are spirit-connected realize what the body is and that the spirit is immortal. Again, SHIM is a pronoun and NOT a noun. It doesn’t matter if the body dies. ONLY the body cares and the spirit is not yet evolved enough to separate itself as distinct from the body. Some day you WILL understand. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 105: In many cultural/philosophical circles (particularly those of the east, to my knowledge), masturbation is viewed as a means toward depletion and dissipation of one’s vitality, or vital force/praha which is contained in bodily sexual fluids. Some of these eastern teachings appear to regard retention of bodily sexual fluids (and thus vitality) as essential to evolution and enhancing the physical vehicle so that soul expression can also be enhanced. That's my understanding of it anyway. There are in fact even exercises designed to 'transmute' this vital essence to higher centres/functions. What's your perspective on this? Answer: In order to maintain a healthy male genital system, you must release fluids. Retention will cause blockages and prostate problems. There is a misunderstanding of the relationship between the spirit and the body in Eastern religions. Remember ALL religions are control organizations. Retention of bodily fluids is NOT essential to evolution. It is detrimental to the body. The key to sexual stimulation and to try enhancing spiritually (this is only ONE path) is to channel the energy into the spirit as you are building up in intensity. This should be done when the intent of masturbation is to increase spiritual identity. Also, reach the peak of this event JUST before ejaculation, but ejaculation itself will drive the intent to its conclusion. If you do not ejaculate, you haven't completed the process. You must let go of the thought build-up and that happens at ejaculation. If you hold on to it by stifling ejaculation, the thought does not complete and the energy is bottled up. This method is really only one path, and not the most efficient by far. But you “gotta do” what you “gotta do”. These sexual exercises are also most concerned with the lower 3 chakras and not the heart chakra and above. The connection to vour Higher Self does not require the use of sexuality this wav, not at all. Question 106: Well, I'm from Argentina and I read your material. It is not only quite interesting but also it has triggered some things inside of me, spiritually speaking, I have some questions to ask you personally on your material: 1- I know that you say all about sexuality that \"like attracts like\" and that one final incarnation should not seek out the opposite. Well, I KNOW that I'm not a final incarnation but I know (and this I REALLY know) that I'm a dominant one, my all life depends on my understanding of how things works inside of me and I'm no longer interested in external things such \"what people say\" or what should I do if someone do this..., etc. it is wrong to stay with my girlfriend if I really FEEL that SHIM is also on the same path as me? and I enjoy SHIM presence and 402"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"communication? I know I DECIDED this way, it is really wrong for my evolution? What do you think on all this? Answer; There is no “right” or “wrong” in terms of the decisions you make during your development. There are faster and slower paths depending on some of your choices, but no wrong/right. Only you can tell if you are a Final or Dominant incarnation. One of my Dominant incarnations was as a married woman with 3 children. A Dominant is VERY different from a Final incarnation. The need for the opposite gender is strictly of the body. If 2 spirits wanted to be together in a Final incarnation, they would both be of the SAME gender as this is in harmony with the First Law of the Universe. For anything but the Final Incarnation, it doesn't matter. An UNAWAKENED Final incarnation may still make the body errors of opposite gender attraction. An AWAKENED Final incarnation's spirit is more powerful than the DNA command and will override it. This incarnation may not want to be involved with anyone of the opposite gender where sex is an issue or may only want someone of the same gender. The Final incarnation is THE major step in the Earth sequence. AWAKENED Final incarnations do NOT waste time chasing around the opposite gender, and if they are in a gay or lesbian body, do NOT waste time chasing around the same gender. Final incarnations have no problems with seeing people as who they really are. Dominant incarnations have no homophobic or other gender-based issues and neither do very advanced incarnations. You have misused the word 'SHIM'. You cannot refer to someone as SHIM when they are in a physical body. It's he or she. SHIM strictly refers to non-incarnates/spirits, which are both male and female. If you were to the point of being ready to embrace the First Law of the Universe, you would not have to ask the questions on male/female relationships the way you do. Live YOUR choices. Do what YOU wish to do. These are your experiences. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 107: I was reading and I notice there is a discussion of the Andromedan incarnational cycle VS the earth experience where the Andromedan is a safe and slower evolutionary path and the earth is a place to incarnate if one wants to evolve quickly. Why would a higher self see a faster evolvement as desirable? I don't understand why fast evolvement would be preferable especially since I see earth incarnations as a lot of work. Answer: Since you are in the Earth incarnational cycle, you’ll have to ask YOUR Higher Self why SHIM chose this path. I remember Monroe telling me how the majority of the Higher Selves avoid the Earth experience because they will forget who they really are. Why do some accept difficult challenges? Why do most take the easy route? For your answer, you must connect to YOUR Higher Self as I cannot speak for SHIM. I will say the rewards far outweigh the risks for those who choose the Earth route. 403"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Why is it so hard to connect with one's Higher Self to obtain ancient wisdom? Is it our genetic programming? I know the higher knowledge and remembrance is in my conscious somewhere but there's a block. I've had one OBE experience, which explained basically for everything on the Earth there is a reason whether it's war, famine, whatever. After this life on earth, I'm finding another planet that has some intelligence life forms on it. If I had one wish I could fulfill, it would be to be surrounded by such minds as Nikola Tesla, Mozart and other geniuses who were obviously out of place and time during their lifetimes. It is no wonder they felt out of place during their lifetimes. I like forward toward your response. Answer: See \"On the Blocks Between the Higher Self and Incarnations in the main material. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 109: Truly fascinating stuff that you've written about your first person experiences. Thank you :-) Separate from Monroe’s HemiSync, with which I am familiar and somewhat experienced (Threshold tape series) I plan to employ newly developed Tree of Life Foundation Accutone sequences (a protocol for manipulating (M) field energies of profound import These Accutones will be employed in conjunction with the CHEC HemiSync as they are complimentary. Then, whatever TMI program is most beneficial for Focus 27 acquisition is next. (I've had many Self-conscious dreams of Being in the biggest library imaginable, but cannot consciously recall what it was that I was learning after awakening and I've often wondered ... Focus 27 preparation?) I believe you tapped into the Library on level 27. The Monroe Institute has their Beyond 27 week that takes participants to the mid-30's levels. This is where the Higher Selves are residing. Is there anything else that you can/will contribute regarding \"getting the most\" from Gateway? Answer: Gateway, of course, does not take you beyond Focus 21, so to get to 27, you'd have to go to Lifeline, which has a great tour of 27's Library, Healing Center, etc. For someone who has completed Gateway, the key to your Higher Self is in Focus 12. To access your Higher Self, go to 12 and then move within yourself to reach your Higher Self. If you go to Focus mid-30's you can view your Higher Self from without, but you must get within (from level 12) to access the stored data and meet your Dominant Incarnations and find out where you stand with them. Go for it, and thanks for your comments. Question 110: I've been feeling a disorientation with 'the world' most of my life. In particular, the last ten years has seen my life take enormous changes as, in following my inner guidance, I've opted out of the 'trap' I had set for myself (marriage). While there are still repercussions of that trap (through the divorce courts), I have (courageously, some have said) followed a calling that often times has been at odds with everyone around me and has in no way been easy. An overriding hunger and thirst after knowledge and truth became my prime motivation. Along the way, I have also digested the books of Robert Monroe, David Icke, 'The Handbook for the New Paradigm', Val Valerian, Alex Collier, Harry Palmer and many others in my quest to gain such clarity. It certainly has been an interesting ride... But, the net result is: I just don't seem to 'fit in' anywhere! I notice subtle and not so subtle indications that I'm indeed, truly ON MY OWN. And this realization is what truly saddens me. The loneliness I've experienced in this life has only 404"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. grown with each new personal change. Paradoxically, as I’ve sought deeper connections, I’ve ultimately experienced greater separation -- Socially — professionally — personally. It’s like my life has been a journey to find my way home in a foreign place, and now this place, where I exist, is turning nightmarish ! Answer: Congratulations for realizing the trap of marriage and having the courage to remove yourself from it. It’s never easy when you go against the Game, but that's part of the test of spiritual maturity. Again, you have made the connection and are seeing the Game for what it is, a major control device. Produce for the Empire, breed for the Empire, obey the Empire. The loneliness you feel is also felt by me, but it is a loneliness based on your spiritual maturing vs. those around you in far lower incarnations. The loneliness is also part of the test for your spiritual maturity. To spiral out you have to be able to do it alone to realize the only one you can really count on is yourself, not ANY external support. If (big IF) you can meet someone in your area who is also spiraling out, you can assist each other, but each path is individual and unless you can both progress at the same rate, one will part from the other. Question 111: My ideals, one by one, have all been shattered. I have no interest in making money beyond that which gives me a measure of autonomy and the illusion of personal freedom, (and I'm very aware that true freedom in this third density is an illusion), games and sports bore me, I have long ago unplugged from TV due to its annoying mind control which became so obvious to me, but not to anyone else around me. The 'passions of everyday life’ have one by one left me. Even the pleasures of sex, and my relentless pursuit to find my ’soulmate’, has only put me on a path of a series of relationships that underscore the friction and differences between me and the opposite sex and have created pain in my life. Answer: The “soul-mate” trap is also one of the ’’look for an external savior/you are not whole in yourself’ ploys. This is a lie. You ARE whole in yourself. The lie of ’now you 2 are 1' in the marriage trap is to make you believe there are male/female spirits and you can't progress without the opposite gender. This is to get you to breed for the Empire. That you had a series of relationships that you describe is the loop you were in. You keep repeating the same mistake until you realize the mistake, break the loop and progress onward. Staying in the loop brings repetitive pain. Question 112: The only thing I get mildly excited about is increasing my freedom (individual sovereignty), reducing my need for 'things', and increasing my knowledge or understanding of where the world is at and how I fit into it. And, I suppose that this is why I write. This information has impacted me and finds me at a peculiar time. Because of what I’ve just related, I don’t know what’s down the line for me. I want to have a purpose, I desire clarity, but I’m not laying hold on it. There seem to be.... blocks.... Answer: Blocks are still parts of your Higher Self you are not connecting with areas where your physical self (DNA commands) still controls you. Question 113: ... it's a difficult place to be in. To be honest, I'm a fairly positive person at heart, but the very thought of 'spiraling outta here' is very appealing to me. I'm ready! If loneliness is all that is left for me, than what is the purpose of my being here? Answer: That you are still here says there are still things for you to do/learn. I've asked myself that particular 'why' several times. You cannot leave before your time. Hang in there MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 405"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"and see what comes to you. Each person's 'purpose' is different in some respects, but the basic purpose is to gain experience. Question 114: There’s nothing here that I want to hold on to. American culture has become a nightmare with its corporate conglomerates, talking heads, bad music, shopping malls, fast-food poisons, pharmaceutically controlled populace and emerging, barbaric new world order and minions like janet reno and the clintons sitting in places of power! I mean, who in their right mind, can really enjoy this reality?? Answer: 99% of the planet can enjoy this reality. We all do until reaching Advanced incarnations when we get the desire for something more/better. Questioner 115: So, any suggestions to a fellow life traveler beyond what I can predict would be the obvious — (to continue seeking connection with my higher self?) I figure I'm probably not a final incarnation because it is pretty hard to even conceive of me being sexually attracted to another man. I just don't see that happening. I'm not 'wired' that way. Answer: You are obeying your Orion DNA commands and that is the body talking. The spirit/Higher Self would NEVER make such a comment. Your 'wiring' is the DNA block and something you haven't overcome and may not overcome in this incarnation unless you mature enough to override this particular command. This is a whole other spiritual facet you need to understand before you can leave. Unless you understand and live the First Law of the Universe (Like Attracts Like), you are not ready to end the 3rd density cycle. My suggestion is instead of blankly saying 'no way' (DNA command), just leave the door open to whatever may happen. Only you can stifle your growth. The Game will be happy to assist you in stifling, but you are in control. Until you do become free of your DNA wiring, you haven't reached the spiritual maturity of a Final Incarnation. However, be who you are and be true to yourself. Questioner 116: ... But it is interesting, I find 1 am less and less controlled by my sexual appetites these days, which used to run supreme. While women still attract me physically (through all the senses), I'm thoroughly tired of the chase...it never did bring me The deep intimacy my soul yearns for. So, I appear to be in 'nowhereland' and can really use some guidance. Thank you for releasing this information. It has stimulated me like I haven't been since reading 'the handbook' a year ago. I know I've shared more than you wish to know...but I would genuinely appreciate your responses... Answer: That’s because the attraction for the opposite gender is artificial and a DNA major command. When, in Ancient Earth, the Earther was split into 2 genders, they were repulsed by each other and had to be forced (by DNA command) to come together. The physical attraction for the opposite gender is a body, Orion DNA command that is NOT of the spirit. It is a powerful command that only the spiritually very mature can overcome or is shorted out as in most gay/lesbian bodies. It is your spirit that is tired of obeying the body. You will not find the deep intimacy you look for when you don't/won't/can't follow the First Law of the Universe. Something for you to think about. Our true form is nothing like these physical bodies and overcoming the artificial whims of the body is something we must do to 95% spirit override.

Answer: It's not a dream, the Orion Empire has been in behind-the-scenes control, in one form or another, since their genetic scientists created genders on Earth. It’s just now that they want to return to OVERT control. Question 118: How can it be that any Being with knowledge of the \"higher\" dimensions could be so foolish? Answer: You must remember that the Orion Empire's queen is in league with the other Dark forces to try and extend control beyond what they now have (read the 3 Handbooks). It's not as much what they know, it's what they don't want Earthers to know. Question 119: Their reputed technological \"mastery\" is meaningless if, as has been stated, all knowledge available past-present-future is accessible at Focus 27. It seems to me that a cadre of awake, aware, and pissed Earther's could-would make use of the nonphysical resources available to implement the needed defensive technologies to stomp their leathery reptilian butts. What an exciting thought, eh? Star Wars for real here now. Answer: And exactly how many Earthers do you know who can access Focus 27 AND have the ability to put what they learn there into action? What you propose would be a dramatic change in the Game. As Monroe said, this would not be permitted. The Higher Selves incarnating here have decided to use the Game to rapidly advance. In the future, on New Earth, post-Game, this can become a reality, but for now, we must be in the Game on an individual level (to whatever degree). Question 120: Since, ultimately there is no right or wrong only experience, what a game to engage in! Please tell me, have any of these assertions published on Val's website been discussed with the TMI folks? Answer: They are not interested. I have my own opinions about that but will not make them public. Should we ever meet I'd be glad to share them with you. Question 121: Separately, we employ kinesiologic testing to establish the relative level of Truth for anything \"outside\" of the Creator's \"Heaven\". (Refer to David R. Hawkins book \"Power vs. Force\") Based on our testing, the King James version bible calibrates at 495 on our \"arbitrary standard\" scale of 1-1000. The highest level we’ve calibrated previously is the original Jewish Pentatuch at 965. A Course in Miracles calibrates at 660, while the various Seth books from Jane Roberts calibrate from 595-660 depending upon the title. When we calibrated Monroe's Ultimate Journey we were astounded to obtain a 2000 level! Several recalibrations employing different individuals of known \"Level of Consciousness\" confirmed the 2000 level. Then, we calibrated the truth level of the ROTE given to Bob, when he was at the transfer aperture (we use the terminology of LoC, or Level of Consciousness, where the higher the LoC the higher the \"truth\" or \"knowing\"). This ROTE calibrates at 5000! Keeping in mind that our LoC calibrations are log base 10, the difference of a single digit is huge. The \"jump\" from below 1000 level to a 5000 level is truly staggering, or as we are wont to say \"holy shit, this is hot shit!\":-) Response: Monroe's material is amazing. It's unfortunate that he was not able to publish Ultimate Journey in its original form.

Answer: You must be aware that the government infiltrates organizations such as yours. They are all consumed with technology. My advancements come from non-technological development. The more technology is used, the less that your spiritual abilities will develop. Technology is a 3rd density manifestation. My goal is to spiral out into the non- technological higher densities with the conclusion of this Final Incarnation. While what you are do is with noble intent, it is not part of my path. The knowledge you seek from the Library is something you'd have to access yourself. It's just not my thing.

Question 123: Thank you for your recent articulate and helpful response. I have another question that's been going through my mind... somewhere in your text you say something to the effect of: \"If you want an easy life, go to Andromeda, if you want the hard test, go to Earth — as incarnations on Earth progress much faster and further than in other venues\". The development of character through the hard experiences of this third dimension make a lot of sense to me. What doesn't make sense to me is this: If our spirits exist outside of time, when what benefit is there to progressing faster than another? If time itself is an illusion, a construct, then to what benefit is 'evolving faster'? And faster and further' connote some kind of competition for an exalted state of being.... is that really the case in the big picture? Of course, trying to comprehend states outside of time is difficult from our 3D perspective, at least for my brain! Perhaps you could clarify? Answer: While time does not exist outside of 3rd density, there is still the internal necessity of the Higher Selves to progress and mature. Why do some kids take the rapid advancement through schools? Why are there those who graduate college when they should be in high school by age? Each Higher Self is unique with unique requirements. You're looking for conformity (an Earth/Orion curse that everything should be the same). You have to grasp the idea of true uniqueness, individuality and freedom. The benefit knowledge you seek will be revealed to you by your Higher Self when you are ready. If you're looking for a group movement, that's your DNA commands wanting to conform to the Game. You are still operating on the 3rd density physical mode by these questions. What is going on is beyond, far beyond 3rd density life. Just because the Orion model of control/competition exists here does not make it so to the Higher Selves. You have to realign your thinking to understand. This involves getting instruction from your own Higher Self, accessing the Library on Level 27 and exploring on your own. If you cannot do these yet, it may be you are not quite yet ready or it will not be the matter of your current incarnation. There are several Earth-brain numbing concepts that we, on this planet, just cannot comprehend the mechanics of yet. Not to worry about that.

Question 124: From the piece Which Road Are You Choosing ? : While there are many paths to progression, there are basically 2 types of roads - smooth and rocky ... Doesn't this thought process go against most messages about our time here? The positive movement, new agers, etc. all seem to say that if your life is Not going smoothly it’s due to you not following your purpose, being too negative, and being out of touch with your inner self. They say that suffering is optional and that the smooth road is your birthright if only you would get with it. Answer: Almost everything I’ve written about goes against most of what you hear from polaric sources. The smooth road is where you buck higher development and where you conform to the Game and its rules. You will suffer FAR more on the smooth road if you are supposed to be on the rocky road. One person I know had the opportunity to take the rocky road and immense psychic development and learning. It was his choice. Instead he chose the seemingly smooth road of conforming to what was expected of him by others, i.e. marriage to a controlling, restrictive female who deceived him into breeding. Marriage, breeding, etc are all part of the smooth road, smooth because you are participating in what the Game requires. This person has since denied his tremendous psychic abilities. In order for him to progress again, in this lifetime, he has to make major decisions that will set him again on the rocky road. The rocks, as stated in the material, are the obstacles thrown by the Game at you to try and get you to return. These rocks include disfavor by family and so-called ’friends’, the body's desire to override the spirit and drag SHIM back into the Game, and so on. As far as suffering goes, your spirit suffers far more on the smooth path. Your body suffers far more on the rocky path as you struggle to control its desires to be in the Game. The New Age religion is full of, especially, Light polarity traps and lies. The person I mentioned is suffering FAR more by having chosen the seemingly smooth path of the body. His spirit suffers due to his choices. Meanwhile the body has what it wants, the APPEARANCE of conformity (but in private, it's a mess). New Age lies of ‘karma carried over into other lives’ is another lie. Karma comes from the Hindu religion, the religion of minion spirits. You can't convert to Hindu, you have to be born into it, but that doesn't stop the non-Hindus from taking their control methods. Karma is pretty much an instant event. You go up to a stranger and smile and the stranger smiles back. You hit a stranger, and the stranger hits you back. Instant karma. None of what I heard from one woman is true- \"That bitch owes me so much she'll spend 1,000 lifetimes paying me back.\" That's a lie UNLESS you believe it. Monroe said that believers of the karma myth will make it so ONLY as long as they believe it. Once they advance enough, they realize it just isn't so and the karmic wheel, for them, of debt/get stops. Finally, remember what I said in my material that once you get to an increasingly spiritually mature state, the rocks on the rocky road are fewer and fewer until it becomes the TRUE smooth path, which is YOUR progression and spiral out of the Game. 409"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Answer: Experiencing polarity is, for the most part, what 3rd density existence is about. However it is to experience BOTH sides of polarity, then blend them together to find Balance. Balance attainment usually happens in higher densities. That the Orion/Sirian Empires are stuck in Dark polarity is true. The only change that Orion had was from male dominated to female dominated millions of years ago. Now why don't they evolve beyond the Dark, since they are the oldest 3rd density race, is something I can't really answer other than to say they refuse to, being so rooted in the Dark polarity. Reading the 3 Handbooks gives you some insight into the Dark plans. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 126: I personally found the material in Jane Robert's books, THE EDUCATION OF OVERSOUL 7 and THE FURTHER EDUCATION OF OVERSOUL SEVEN, very helpful. It is similar to your material if we replace the word 'OVERSOUL' with\" HIGHER SELF.\" Are you familiar with the material? Answer: I haven't read this material, so I cannot comment on it. Question 127: I find that astrology as currently used and taught in our society makes people scared to move a step without consulting their astrologist first. This is wrong. The daily astrology advise in our papers is mostly fortune telling. We create our own reality and if we buy into other people's belief systems, then we no longer create our own reality. I think you might clarify or expand your comments about the validity of astrology in general. Answer: First of all, 'astrologist' is an incorrect term. It is astrologer. If some people become 'scared' because of astrology, it's their problem and not that of astrology. You've played right into the victimhood part of the Game with that comment. As for the astrological snippets in newspapers, they are rarely correct, but then they are strictly for entertainment purposes. No 'fortune telling' there. Astrology is completely valid IF the individual has a horoscope cast specifically for him/her AND the birth data is accurate. If the birth time is 10 minutes off, the horoscope will have inaccuracies. The burden for accurate information lies with the client and not with the astrologer as far as the casting is concerned. Also, there are astrologers (people who have studied for years) and then there are want to be astrologers (buy a computer program and sell charts or one who has never studied, but just read a book or two). It's up to the client to check out the astrologer's credentials before consulting. That you choose to play victim and victim advocate is your weakness. Astrology is the most complicated of the predictive methods and the most accurate when the data is accurate. If you don't care for it, that's one thing, but that does in no way invalidate this science. Question 128: I find that most astrological forecasts for the world on the internet turn out totally wrong. All timelines have been altered and most prophets and astrologists are being proven more wrong than right. Also there are many other systems [non astrological] that can be used to discover what the Higher Self has come to experience in any life. Each of us may use a different system which is more helpful to us. 410"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Reply: I really don't know why you're carrying on so. The second Law of the Universe is Allowance. If you don't like astrology, that's your business. But just because it hasn't worked as you expect it to does not invalidate it for everyone else. Astrology is very complex and you probably are not capable of grasping the complexities of it, which is fine. Stick to what works for you. I haven’t read anything on Val's site that says astrology is the alpha and omega of predictive methods. Also, who appointed you to speak for a group? MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Comment 129: I wish I'd come across your material a little earlier as I have been 'trapped' in a situation that, in retrospect, I would never have gotten into had I had the time to sit and contemplate what my inner voice was telling me. Reply: The inner voice you hear is informational pulses from your Higher Self. Your body's DNA commands overruled your spirit and you conformed. That is the lesson you have been experiencing. Comment 130: I have never agreed with marriage, I never understood the gender wars and what was happening to females and their controlling tactics and manipulations (this resulted in some very fractious relationships) and I expected never to marry or have children or follow 'the flow’ - quite simply it all didn't agree with me and I expected to lead quite a lonely but spiritually rewarding existence despite the pressures from family and peers to \"settle down\". Reply: This was your spirit talking. I've observed that once the rare type of person expresses these sentiments, a vibration is put out that those of the Game respond to as a challenge and they begin to actively seek you out to drag you back into the depths. Unfortunately, you weren't spiritually strong enough to resist and you were allowed to experience your current miserable situation to learn from your errors. Comment 131: A year ago I met someone who very quickly moved herself and her small child into my life along with a huge amount of baggage from the previous relationship with the childs’ father - they presented themselves as needing ’rescuing’ from the fathers' continuous and bitter court cases for custody and I fell into it. Reply: This is typical victim behavior that females LOVE to use to control males. Unfortunately, you couldn't resist the 'line’. As the very wise Roman poet and philosopher Virgil said, \"Foolish is the man who trusts a woman.\" I'd also add 'foolish is the woman who thinks she can change a man’. It is the woman's desire to change and manipulate man that gets her into so much trouble with men. They refuse to accept him as he is, try to make him into what he doesn't want to be, then wonder why he lashes out. As I’ve said in my other materials, other than for conception, males and females are totally incompatible. Yes, this goes to Orion DNA commands and is a big part of the Game. Women LOVE to use the ’oh poor me’ and far too many men fall for it then see as the manipulative creature begins her manipulations on him! Question 132: The problem is I now have the responsibility for a 4 year old stepdaughter and my own 9 month old daughter and our family unit as a whole - what should I do about this situation? 411"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Answer: For your own sake, you need to throw the baggage out! She used deception and manipulation to move in. Now that you're aware of it, you need to summon the courage to throw her out or move out yourself. The stepdaughter is the problem of her mother's first husband. You can field responsibility for your daughter without living with the woman. Being the type she is, she'll put her victim mask on again and find another sucker to drain. However, you'll be free to pursue your own life. Question 133: Sometimes I have a strong urge to follow what my inner voice says and get out of the situation, but I feel the tug of responsibility for my family and their upbringing -1 do love them very much but I feel trapped. Do you have any guidance for a situation like this? Answer: As I said earlier, your inner voice is your Higher Self. You can choose to ignore your Higher Self and continue to suffer. Yes, if you tell her it's over, she'll carry on and spread the poison only a female can spread. This is part of the price you must pay for your freedom IF it means that much to you. As you say, you're trapped. Being trapped will only stagnate your spiritual growth and shorten your lifespan. It will take courage to embrace your spiritual side and the shrew will warp words to try and place huge guilt on you. You must ignore these comments and consider the controlling source! MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 134: As a Final Incarnate, what is your perspective on the prayer/affirmation in the Handbook for the New Paradigm which says \"I am a human God Man/Woman becoming - help me to become God Man/Woman realized? After connecting to your higher self and knowing who you truly are, would you consider or know that you are God Man/Woman realized? Answer: The Handbook affirmation is a good mantra, but I would alter it slightly to \"I am in a human becoming, help me to become\". What you have written is not the mantra. Once you have personal realization of who you are and are connected to your Higher Self, you no longer have need of this mantra. Knowing who you are is one thing. Operating in a human body full of alien DNA commands and restrictions inhibits the spirit, but the goal is NOT reversal of ALL DNA commands, but self-awareness. Question 135: many eastern philosophies indicate that any kind of sexual activity culminating in orgasm depletes the physical body of its vital essence. Is this part of the Orion or Syrian brainwashing? Answer: This has already been covered in the material. Many Eastern philosophies are wrong and alien manipulated, getting into the false sacredness of the physical as opposed to the dynamo of the spirit. Question 136: Do you feel that friendship - be it platonic or otherwise - is truly possible between 'opposite' genders (perhaps in Spirit-dominated incarnations, it is)? Answer: Of course it's possible. It's easier for a spirit in a male body than one in a female body due to the females Orion DNA activation and desire to dominate and control males. I have a few females who are very good friends, but I also limit how close they can get to me. 2 of them are very Advanced spirits, so it's much easier to deal with. They are far easier to 412"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. deal with than men who 'need' a female. One of my closest female friends has evolved beyond the 'need' for a male and is a lot of fun. Once they have spiritually progressed to overcome this flaw in the body, they become truly liberated and are really pleasant to be around. So, yes, it is possible. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 137: Hello, I've been skimming thru your articles on the higher self and I had a question. Why would my higher self appear somewhat faceless in the dreamtime as I believe I have seen on a few occasions. Sometimes I would switch bodies with it as well. I thank you for your work. Answer: You definitely won't get as much by skimming these articles. What many people call their guide or guardian is actually their Higher Self, in almost all cases. You will have to access your own individual Higher Self to get the answer to your question. Read...don't skim! Question 138: There is an \"apparent\" paradox on assuming the position of an observer ... The news elements that you provide (specifically the drugging our our children) begs for response. Almost like a call to action. If we are to take no action against \"wrongs;\" if we are to observe —not only the dumbing-down of our children, but the absolute conditioning of their capacity — and regard this scenario as only a \"game,\" then why post this information in the first place? Answer: Your point is a good one. It's NOT to sit by and allow yourself to continue to be dragged along by the Game. It's to take the observations and apply them to your life, if you wish, and remove yourself from them. This would include your pre-adult children as well. Using the Second Law of the Universe, you can remove yourself from participation and do only what is necessary. The Game says OBEY. If you choose to separate, you say 'not if I don’t have to'. For example, you don't HAVE to brush with fluoride toothpaste...you don't HAVE to get married...you don't HAVE to breed...you don't HAVE to live to please others...and so on. The call to action is to WAKE UP! Once awakened, you withdraw and begin to spiral out. BUT the Second Law says you must allow those who wish to participate in the Game to continue doing so. YOU CANNOT SAVE ANYONE BUT YOURSELF. This should help you gain an important perspective. Question 139: In Robert Monroe's latest book, there is a pervading thread that somewhat nags Robert about his impulse/desire to \"do something\" for mankind. This point is finally resolved for him in that, yes, most of these urges are ego driven, but on occasion, there is a \"higher\" universal motivation for service (when the dog is wagging the tail, and not vice versa). It was suggested that the magnitude of his potential effort was such that it was out beyond the usual egotistical realm. This speaks to my question to you about observing vs. service (and in some cases, I don't regard these two concepts as being mutually exclusive at all). Through trufax, you provide a service; you apparently are doing more than simply watching. You disseminate valuable information and perspectives that have value, and may cause a stirring \"in the members.\" On the face, it appears that your transposing/creating has a non-observational reality. As if this service would not exists unless you responded to it. I would see this as a motivation to participate (not in the game, but in providing the real 413"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. rules of the game so that sentient beings can exclude themselves from further participation). Am I making myself clear to you? Answer: Your comments are a bit cumbersome, but I think I got your drift. The material I have released will make it easier for the Dominant and especially the Final Incarnations to see the Game for what it is and make decisions, based on the knowledge, to spiral away from the Game and on to higher realms, if they so choose. By excluding yourself from the Game, as much as possible, you are 'saving' yourself. A mature spirit will be able to override the body's DNA commands, realize SHIM's individual nature and act accordingly. This data has been unavailable anywhere public and it is necessary to be made available at this time. Followers are the last things I want. Take what info you can deal with and adapt it to your situation. Most importantly, connect with your Higher Self. By providing an escape hatch, the Game withdrawn from. Monroe provided a very important batch of information in his 3 books, and at the Institute, if one can afford to attend. Unfortunately, his 3rd book is severely watered down as he told my group that publishers wouldn't touch it because the public couldn't handle it. Well, the public can’t handle what I've been releasing, but then my material is NOT for the general public, as stated. Observers DO things, watchers don't, but observers also follow the Laws of the Universe, especially one and two. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 140: You shouldn't have included all of these question buttons, because people like me will surely push ’em. Shouldn't the most advanced states of enlightenment embody the ideal that \"You don't need anyone\" Male or female? Answer: Yes, you don't NEED anyone, but unless you're willing to share experiences, you miss the point. We are social beings and not hermits. Yet, due to Orion DNA, the forced 'need' for the opposite gender is built in and only overcome by failure of that segment of DNA command or the highly advanced spirit who can overcome that command by will. Question 141: ... And since we are all diplomats of the higher self, and internally, or rather spiritually we are sex-less ... Answer: We are not at all 'sex-less'. The Higher Self incorporates BOTH genders in one. \"Sex-less\" is neither genders. Question 142: ... Should not the appeal for companionship apply to the soul or spirit of whomever we so choose. Should we not strive to meet with souls we find enticing (As evidenced through their thoughts and actions) Regardless of their sexuality or sex? Answer: You are correct, but how many people do YOU know who will follow that line regardless of gender? Then there's also the built in electrical/chemical shorting out of Higher Self functions built into the physical bodies to keep this from happening. It is not as easy as you would think to accomplish this in a het format. However, do what YOU wish. Time and your Higher Self will set your pace. When you reach a certain level, you will better understand what I'm talking about. Question 143: To play the Game and knowing that one rarely meets another player who speaks out freely about it, makes one wonder whether there is more than one Game to play. 414"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"Of course I've read your viewpoints and learned about your experiences, I've been out and in the Game myself, experienced different parts of different lives in and out off my physical body and still I find it not always easy to see my role as a player from the perspective of my Higher Self. That is, continuously. I do have a large sense of tranquility/joy in confronting third/fourth dimensional happenings. Usually the tranquility is intensified after I've touched base with my Higher Self. Why is it, you think, that so many players keep silent so much? Do they all experience a different Game or/and a different awareness of the Higher Self? Answer: I DO know what you mean about playing with the players. Observers are always gauging reactions, so they can play 'devil's advocate' with those still in the Game by tossing situations at them and seeing how they respond. This is part of the observer experience. You are here to learn. Those you are observing operate under the rules of the Game. It is interesting to see how predictable they'll act even when you've boxed them in with logic and use their own words to do this. Those fully in the Game will not budge from the Game's rules. The Higher Self reveals SHIMself in stages and not until the Awakened Final Incarnation does the incarnated self have full access to the Higher Self, thus varying degrees of awareness and varying degrees of body dominance/ID and Higher Self control.

Question 144: For example, although I am 50 years old I have somehow \"known\" since I was a teenager that my body is just a \"meat suit\" that houses the real me, a suit that I have always found heavy, unpleasant and energy-draining to lug around. This is despite having been blessed with a large, powerful and exceptionally healthy carcass. Another thing: As I read about what you refer to as the \"game\" it resonates totally with my own recent and massive insight into what I am calling the \"simulation\": a high-intensity total-immersion super-virtual-reality program run by entities not having our best interests at heart. With respect to the meat suit and the Game, these are things that I most definitely want to exit ASAP, so what do you recommend I do? I tried suicide once some 20 years ago and now believe that taking that route is a mistake, that there needs to be a better way. I certainly do not want to make my current dilemma worse by reducing my options or, God forbid, trapping myself in the simulation by falling asleep again indefinitely. What do you think? Answer: Suicide is an experience option of death available to a Higher Self. It's up to that Higher Self whether to choose it or not, but that would have been done before incarnating as your death is set before birth. ONLY someone with a Higher Self will choose suicide. Minions would NEVER choose it. Like you, I find little to stay around here for, but, since I'm still here, there are things for me to accomplish. I have faith in myself and suicide is not an option for me. Trust in your (Higher) self as well. If you would have left, you'd have never run into this material, for one. It's the frustrations of being where you are and finding yourself surrounded with people who want nothing better than to play the Game. Many interesting events are unfolding - you can see them now. Question 145: I am vibrating with excitement after \"accidentally\" finding Leading Edge Research Group yesterday while web-surfing? I have read all of Monroe and lately I been fervently asking my High Self to reveal to me the exact methods/technology for identifying my beliefs, collapsing unwanted/non-useful beliefs, and installing new beliefs that serve me better. The first question (above) is somewhat rhetorical but I would still welcome an 415"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"answer. The second question is: Can you direct me to specific resources that will help me teach and train myself to achieve total management of my beliefs? This is the only goal I currently have in my life, and I will do whatever it takes to achieve it. Answer: First, read all the books (3-volume Handbook for the New Paradigm, and Monroe's 3 books). You will be led to more. Keep watching my updates. Keep up the good work. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 146: What is the fate of the cloned or soul-less beings? If all human life forms must be animated, why is cloning allowed? Are cloned beings animated? If so, how are they animated? Answer: The minion spirited beings, as stated in the material, originate in the animal (nature spirit) group soul. Upon death of the physical body, they return to this group soul. Who do you think is going to stop cloning? No one stopped the Orion Empire from altering Ancient Earth humans to what they are today. A Higher Self spirit can animate any type of human on Earth for the experience. It’s the overpopulation that has required energy from the animal group soul. Question 147: What of the tortured beings in cages in underground military bases? Did they chose this fate prior to incarnation? Answer: You would have to ask the individual Higher Selves about that. Remember EVERYTHING is an experience. There is 110 such thing as good/bad, just different experiences. If the comprehension of that eludes you, push it aside and a more advanced incarnation of your Higher Self will. Question 148: Do souls incarnate merely to overcome negativity? Isn't there a difference between negativity absolute evil? Answer: NO! Experiences, experiences evil and good are polarities and value judgments. For example: humans look on reptilians eating them as 'bad', while reptilians look on eating humans as 'good'. An obstacle to overcome is placing polarity values on experiences. This is overcome in the Final Incarnation. Question 149: How does one know if they are in their final incarnation? Answer: You are able to connect with your Higher Self. More on this was covered in the materials. Question 150: Can the dark forces actually capture a soul & prevent it from reincarnating? (\"Soul Catcher\" microchip) Answer; Yes, but they'd rather toss SHIM back into the physical of their choosing to produce for the Empire. Question 151: Is a soul responsible for their earthly actions when under mind control? 416"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"Answer: If one is not choosing the action, but is under command of another, ie mind control, obviously the incarnating spirit is not choosing the action. Question 152: How can humans combat mind control, i.e.. EMFs, subliminal programming ? Answer: This is a better question to ask Val. He's got loads of material. The T-i device is one excellent protection. Ask Val MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 153: I have always admired the work of Robert Monroe and David Icke. Since you met Monroe personally, I was wondering if you might know if he knew of the reptilian influence that is taking place on Earth. You mentioned that his last book, Ultimate Journey, was watered down for the public. I have reread Far Journeys and in the chapter \"Hearsay Evidence\" he seems to hint quite strongly of this influence but never mentions anything outright. Answer: Robert, in public, always denied there were ANY intelligent life-forms in the third density galaxy except here on Earth. Some of us knew that wasn't true. Robert was a Scorpio and knew how to hide things. When someone else, from the program I was in at the time, and I met privately with Monroe, we told him about our alien experiences he didn't comment. We told him we saw the aliens coming. He didn’t try to counter that, but wouldn’t say more. Just as Ultimate Journey was severely censored, so was many of the things he talked about. My opinion is due to secret gov't influence at the Institute. Question 154 : My question is about what Robert Monroe calls loosh. Can you please clarify this substance called loosh? Thank you. Answer; Loosh is a word that Monroe created. It is not a physical substance. It is not a word that I care for either. Loosh sounds like something you’d flush down the toilet! What it seems to refer to is the Balanced harmony emissions given off by the Earth of the future. Although not physical, it is a 4th density vibration that is, apparently, harvestable. Any more than that I can't add anything significant as I haven’t investigated it on my own beyond what I've already mentioned. It's just not something I'm particularly interested in at this stage, but I hope that I've clarified it a bit for you. Question 155: Can members of the same family, say for instance, father, mother, son and daughter be of the same Higher Self? Answer: While just about anything is possible, it is not very likely that what you asked would occur. Not enough variation of experience to make it worth the event. Interacting with yourself is not a new experience. You can always interact with yourself within your Higher Self, but it doesn't expand your growth by doing so on the 3rd density. Question 156: After I had digested all your material and compared it with others from TMI, I went through a depression because some of the stuff disturbed me, and one afternoon, took a nap with all of this on my mind, I didn't use any Gateway tapes, I suddenly felt my body asleep and my mind awake in a \"foggy form\" going out of my body, as 417"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"I was observing and feeling the process, slowly going out by the head, an outside invisible force suddenly pushed me back inside the body as if it really didn't want me to go ahead, and a sex urge was triggered. I didn't feel any fear nor panic, instead very calmly, I mentally projected a golden energy balloon around my body and all of a sudden everything stopped! I woke up in the body pondering on what had actually happened and my question was: what was that invisible force that pushed me back???? I could not identify it! Answer: That you successfully used the golden shield drove your attacker away. A golden eggshell will never harm any being with an intent that your Higher Self will allow. The spirit transmitted a sex urge to you knowing that a powerful sex thought will send you back to your body (when you are untrained or a novice). Instead, it didn't work and you wound up driving the spirit away. You're learning things you weren't meant to learn (according to those in control of the planet and lower 4th density). They want to keep you from exploring further. The golden globe is an excellent defense. Add a lack of fear and you're unstoppable. You did well and will be better prepared on your next journey. Question 157 :1 am also a member of the Voyagers Mailing List at TMI, and I realized from the posts there as well as from your material that all this stuff about so called \"Ascended Masters\" is nothing more than another belief system. THANK YOU for clearing out this point! I had a feeling for some time that all of it was just \"crap\"!:-) Answer: Yes, you can add so-called 'ascended masters' to the list of those trying to keep Earthers down and controlled. The only 'master' you need to pay attention to is your own Higher Self, hence you. Keep up the good work and keep investigating. Question 158: You wrote a lot about minion incarnations, I'm wondering how a spirit from the animal level can animate a human body. Is there some kind of connection with tampered human DNA (i.e. smaller amount of strands) that permits this? Answer: Animating spirits are the same at the basic level whether group soul or Higher Self. If the over populated planet didn't have access to group soul spirit energies, Earth would be having stillborn births in droves. Earthers are breeding like rats due to Orion DNA commands since Orion demands for food and laborers is quite high. When a minion incarnation dies, the animating spirit returns to the group soul, but it's nowhere near the same as Higher Self. There is another purpose for the nature spirit group soul, but that is not our concern at this level. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved, Question 159: After death, which density is usually reached after the end of a reincarnation cycle and what form do we take there, the formless higher self? Answer: After each incarnation, we go to the 4th density (astral). When the incarnation is finished on the 4th density, SHIM returns to the Higher Self which is on the 5th density. The artwork on the cover of Matrix V pretty accurately shows w r hat our true form is, and you can see the form is nothing like human. After the Final Incarnation, all the incarnational streams are pulled back into the Higher Self and the next move is to another higher than 5th density. The Higher Self is not formless, SHIM is oval in form. 418"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"Question 160: Apparently there are various kinds of beings living in higher densities (4-5- 6+) who take a form we could characterize as “extraterrestrial.\" Answer: I have interacted with one type of being well beyond 5th density. They do not look like 3rd density humans or any other 3rd density lifeform. When you are ready, you will meet them. They are very interesting and well worth knowing. It isn't necessary for me to say more at this time on this. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved, Question 161: Do the Higher Selves decide what is going to be created in terms of universes and living organisms or does this design come from higher creative sources? Answer: The Higher Self progresses in stages. Once you are finished with 3rd density incarnations and your Final Incarnation takes SHIM's Higher Self to the next level, that Higher Self of you becomes one facet in the next level of your progression and you have a higher version of your Higher Self to work with and gather new, totally different experiences. Eventually you reach a level where you create galaxies and design 3rd density events. It's super neat, but not of any particular concern at the 3rd density level. When you are ready, your own Higher Self will lead you to further information. Question 162: Why are most aliens described as humanoid? Is this strictly a 3-4 th density characteristic? Answer: Humanoid refers, not to human, but basic human form: 2 arms, 2 legs, head, torso. Reptilians are humanoid in shape, but far from human. You can find silicoid incarnations that are humanoid. Yes, this is primarily a 3/4th densities characteristic. The reason it exists on the 4th density is because the spirit is holding the form SHIM had on the 3rd density. If the form was released, the spirit would look like a mini-version of the Higher Self, an oval shape. Question 163: In what way does the Orion queen need these social changes? If the Orions are so powerful, then surely they don't have to change our gender relationships. Answer: Your observations are correct and questions are good ones. Earth is rich in minerals/water. The Orion Empire would prefer NOT to destroy Earth unless Mintaka feels it will lose Earth. Planets belonging to the Orion Empire are all female dominated to mirror the rule of Mintaka. The males are totally subservient to the females. There is much power in the male and this is feared/envied by the female. When you have fear, you try to subdue the external cause of this fear. To keep the males away from their power (something a female cannot have) is paramount. When the Orion Empire deals with other planets in their grip, they do so with female representatives. This is how THEY think. Question 164: What is the future for men as these changes continue over the next few years? 419"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Answer: I was just talking about this with Val last night. IF the Orion changes kept going without check, Earth men will wind up in the female position and females will complete their quest for dominance. This, of course, is a perversion, but then the genetic scientists loaded Earth humans with lots of perverse DNA commands to weaken the being and keep them from finding out who they really are. Monroe's and my trips to the future both saw an end to this cycle. It will not come to the end according to Orion demands. The planet will undergo MASSIVE population reductions. Yet, as far as I can tell, unless the DNA is altered, even with a small population, the female will still demand control. I don't have (yet) the final answer to what will end the female Orion quest, but can only give encouragement that it will end. Keep 2012 in mind. Many major events to unfold in the next 11 years. Meanwhile, until your spirit is mature enough to reject the hypocrisy of heterosexual relations (except for procreation), you will continue to be the object of female control. Your choice. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 165: What is the final Orion plan for males, i.e. will males be eventually eliminated like in the SCUM manifesto? Answer: Males cannot be eliminated, as they have not been able to artificially create the power of life that originates only in the male. This grates on the females like nothing else. They know their eggs only go to enhance the life (sperm) created by the male. This is one of the powers available ONLY to males and combined gender beings. They would like to eliminate the male, but they would be unable to create further female life. Question 166: I'm an 18 year old boy from Australia, and since I have been in my early teens, I have always had these feelings, indicating to me that something is not right here...something is going on, but until now, could not work out clearly what it was. I follow the work of David Icke, Alex Collier, and now your work. I can now see all my life I have been conforming to the Orion DNA programming, whether it be female relationships, driven by Ego etc.. With all the free time I have, I always investigate this sort of information, and I really do feel that I am slowly leaving the game, and getting in touch with my higher self, but as I do this, I see myself closing myself off to all my friends, family etc a lot...I'm becoming more alone, in a sense, at only 18 years old! While I still do the normal \"doings\" of any teenager, I still feel that what I'm doing is not the way it should be...that I’m here for something else. I really want to spiral out of the game, but am finding it very difficult at the same time. Not difficult in accepting the information, (because I have never believed in religion, or any other belief system), but difficult in over riding the programming, which I really want to accomplish. I'd very much appreciate it if you could give me some advice! Answer: Allowing your Real self, your Higher Self, to override the body is a major event that happens in stages ending with your Final Incarnation where you have overcome sufficient bodily commands to progress beyond the desire to stay in the. 3rd density. Just because someone reads the material does not mean they are in their Final Incarnation and NO ONE can tell you if you're a Final except your Higher Self. Overriding the programming is more difficult if you're born into a heterosexual body due to the powerful DNA commands the aliens placed in the body. There are distinct advantages being in a gay/lesbian body, but 420"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. those, in and of themselves, are not enough if the spirit hasn’t advanced enough to make the best out of these advantages. We have choices...follow your inner self or follow your body's commands and do what society demands. Society is full of alien shit and will do nothing but mold you into conforming. Conforming will NOT advance you spiritually, but is necessary in lower incarnations for the experience. It's breaking the conformity that advances you spiritually. When you try to break free of conformity, those people you know will try and drag you back. Shamanic vision will show black threads attaching to you and pins/knives in your back as they try to weaken you spiritually and force your return. Smudging yourself with sage is one way to break these poisons. The best thing you can do is to stick to your guns. It isn't easy. It’s very lonely. If you're a Final Incarnation, you will succeed. If you're not, you will still make progress according to how advanced you are. Don't despair. Your spirit must be purified in the fire of adversity to get the impurities of 3rd density life out of you. In your Final Incarnation, you see things as they really are and you no longer desire to be part of it. We're in the season of Capricorn (conform, conform). It is a season of control (diet, fear death). Final Incarnations will look at those who push their diets as so much of the body. Live longer so you can be put in a home. Better to live fully. You can have as many incarnations as you wish. It's the body that fears death, never the spirit who can’t die. So if someone is always on their die-et, it's body control and desire to extend its existence. BUT you chose the amount of life your body will have BEFORE you were born. This is why you can die jogging, get hit by a bus (and be in prime condition) or smoke cigars and drink (like George Burns) and live to 98! If you have any specific questions, please ask and stay true to yourself. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 167: Greetings, and thank you for the messages disseminated within these pages, they have been a source of much insight and growth. I am currently an 18 year old female body and have been considering the implications of this choice for several months. I believe that I am awakening to my final incarnation, but will not limit my experience in any way I am aware of to avoid. I seek to become more aware of any and all DNA commands that are inherent (possibly) in the female structure. I will not deny the surge of feminist and women-first organizations, and do not judge them, but do not agree with them, either. I have read two of the three handbooks and am currently enjoying the third. I am familiar with most of the books mentioned thus far, including Robert Monroe (didn't like all the acronyms), David Icke (interesting, but perhaps light-oriented?) and a lot of the Leading Edge Research Group articles. Any other links you could offer to an eager learner or numbers of interest in the trufax website itself? Answer: Robert Monroe didn't always speak plainly. He was a Scorpio and would hide many things despite all that he did reveal. So acronyms are one of his things. I tell it as I see it. David Icke’s material is great, but he is definitely a Light-sider who thinks he can 'save' the reptilians. That, of course, runs contrary to the Laws of the Universe, primarily Allowance. This doesn't negate the value of his material, but knowing he's a Lightsider means you have to peel away Lightsider fog. One book you should also read is The Christ Conspiracy. Even if you're not unfortunate enough to be a Christian, we live in a world where Christians pollute minds with their mythologies. Cathy O'Brien's Trance-formation of America is another good, but shocking book showing there is no Earth authority figures that 421"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"Ouest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. can be trusted (to say the least). Other than that, you have to see where you are guided for what YOU need to know /experience. Question 168: As a side comment, I have discovered to my delight that there is a whole community of youth waiting to understand the call to the new paradigm if they are only awakened, while I am not saying I \"should\" awaken anyone, just mentioning my own beliefs and dreams of the future are generally enough to get someone to open to new ways of thinking for themselves. Answer: Make sure you don't substitute 'awaken' for 'save'. All you should do is present what you believe or know (they ARE different). If the person is interested and asks for more, give as long as they are receptive. If not interested, then drop the subjects, because if you try to force the matters, you become as bad as the Christians, muslims or other 'be like me 1 religions. Question 169: I have been interacting with another evolving individual for the last nine months. We are of opposite genders, but we both have come to a point where sex has become a DNA command we recognize and have decided to ignore. We love each other, and are willing to express that love platonically, or otherwise when we are ready. My question here is, what methods could you recommend that we might do together to strengthen our bond as \"SHIMs\"; to join two spirits, as you have mentioned earlier? Answer: That is something you'll have to find on your own. That it's opposite genders is so Orion DNA. I hear lofty statements from some about genders, but they always wind up with the opposite gender and will not even consider the same gender. This, of course, would not be an issue with a Final incarnation. You are where you are. There's plenty of material out there dealing with opposite gender crap. I'm not interested in that in the least as I'm positioned to move beyond the artificial (Orion DNA) commands. You're on your own here. If you're in the slightest way uncomfortable with the thought of partnering with the same gender, you have some incarnational growth to go through yet. This doesn't mean to force yourself, as in a Final Incarnation. There is no force, just release. Question 170: I have experienced great energy and power through physical sex with this man, and believe that a deeper bond would be a blessing to us both. Answer: Yes, this is very het, very Orion DNA commands. He's feeding you his energy and your physical is sucking it up, as per Orion commands. BUT could you feel the same with a woman and him with a man? At your current level, I'd doubt it. This is not a negative judgment, but rather an observation. You are where you are and that's fine...for you. Changes come with time. Even when you have 2 advancing spirits, if they choose to incarnate in opposite gender bodies, it's because they haven't matured spiritually enough to handle their relationship in same gender bodies. This is, again, NOT bad, but rather a stage we all go through (although it's a LONG stage) before advancing. Question 171: In context to the others I have met to share my journey, I was hoping you might know of some simple \"slogans\" or intents to hold as a group focus to further the evolution of ALL that IS. I seek not a polarity, nor a judgment, but honest expansion. Answer: Judgment is required from your own perspective. This anti-judgment stuff comes from Light-siders and is part of the guilt and other crap they shovel at the world. Judgment is decision making based on your best evaluation of a situation and how it applies to YOU. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 422"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"You are seeking group focus rather than individual focus. The group thing is seeking to fence in more than one and the fence itself is a limitation. Higher Selves have to experience individually as each has SHIMself s own path. Intrusion on this path is regressive. Concern over your own path is primary. Everyone else progresses at their own rate. We cannot progress at the same rate on Earth. That reeks of conformity. You will understand this once you have reached Final Incarnation. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 172: I need clarification about connecting to my Higher Self. I have always been 'guided', experienced 'miracles’ in response to 'prayer' (rejected religion as a child), have always been in the 'right' place doing the 'right' thing automatically. I did the' learning by experience' bit, woke up, then embarked on a spiritual 'crash course' all information provided as I asked. I've never been in the Game although it's only recently that I've heard that term outside of my own thoughts. I'd like to 'pop off now but I know there's something else to do. Do I really need to connect? Is there any more to it than I have experienced? I'd love to go 'out of body' but it doesn't happen to me. Why not? Also, I've never been 'attacked' to my knowledge. Answer: The only ones who \"really need to connect\" are Dominant and Final Incarnations. No one else probably will. It’s not something you can force, not even a Very Advanced incarnation. If you're meant to, you will. Everyone's been attacked, you just aren't sensitive enough to know that. As a shaman, I've never known anyone who is attack free. There's always more to what you've experienced. As for out of body, it's something best left to training. There are books out there. I recommend Astral Travel by Gavin & Yvonne Frost who also teach a correspondence course in astral travel. Meanwhile, be content with your particular level of incarnation. Higher Selves only have 2 or 3 Dominants and, obviously, 1 Final Incarnation. Even so, you are all the same Higher Self being. Question 173: I am familiar with David Icke's material, and have been reading Matrix IV recently - now I will for sure need to read Robert Monroe after going through this material. From Matrix IV I've experienced an expansion in awareness. I understand now that what really happens is Responsibility in a way that I have trouble describing. It's not a matter of becoming inactive, but more like continuing to align with my Higher Self and allowing the physical reality to flow as it does, without attachment, but with deep love and understanding. I find as this expansion has been happening in me, my perspective is shifting with regard to how I perceive the world and others. I am quickly losing interest in sex (I'm 44, female, and have 2 children), especially for physical pleasure and have only desired it occasionally recently with my best friend, a man who is also clearly evolving, because I am many times put into a deep state of meditation as a result. But other than this, I don't want it. So what you say is reassuring (i.e., it’s not my hormones changing). I seem to have lost all desire to \"mate\" and feel quite good alone, although at times I wish there were someone I could talk to who would have a clue what I'm talking about (hence this long-winded \"question’’ to you). For about the last two years I've been exploring death, trying to understand how to do it, as I want to be conscious when I die. I've listened to a version of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and wonder if that, too, is an alien roadmap for the after death experience. It purports to teach you to move on from an earth incarnation and not go back in unconsciously. I understand at this point that death is not an escape and I 423"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. know I need to be just as conscious in my living as in my dying. Please comment on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Also, I feel in limbo at the moment and have let go of \"doing\" in a worldly sense, there seems to be nothing that means anything except expansion and alignment with Greater Being. I guess I'm still a little adrift with this, allowing the shift to happen. Thanks for listening. Answer: I can't comment on the Book of the Dead since I haven’t read it nor do I have any desire to read it. Monroe's trilogy is the best 'book of the dead'. Earthers are so use to direction in almost every aspect of their lives to continue conformity to Orion plans that once you try to go out on your own, you find you have to rely primarily on your Higher Self as each path is unique. You have to get use to NOT having people tell you what you should be doing and do what YOU feel you must, especially if it runs contrary to society. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 174: Hi, i am an 18 year old male. Ever since i have entered my teenage years i have searched out and studied spiritual matters, i have always felt an innate understanding of these things which goes beyond words. The first time i read your writings, my higher self jumped on me. I was involved in a relationship with a female at the time, and I was torn (between my body/society/obligation and higher self), after much self induced strife, I have recently terminated the relationship. Answer: Congratulations! Your Higher Self has awakened you to the danger of not following the Universal Laws. The urges to satisfy the physical/society/etc IS of the body and the Orion DNA commands. These commands exist to keep you from connecting to your Higher Self and keep you on the wheel of time (repetitive) rather than the spiral (progression). Question 175: Looking back, and even observing now I am amazed at the potency with which the female can poison the mind. Answer: You have gotten that one correct. The reptilian female is equipped with literal poison. The Earth female has manipulative poison to serve her interests. This is something people have to discover and feel the sting of before they realize it. Question 176: She became interested in spiritual matters, but I am uncertain whether she did it to grow or to further an illusion in which I was mired. In any case, I am now confronted with certain psychic bonds and connections from which I am freeing myself. I’m finding this to be complicated, and I get the impression from my higher self, that this is part of my growth. Answer: Earth females excel in spinning webs to further her ambitions. These can be overt or covert, but both have the same ends: to control males, per the Orion command. Their favorite trap is to become pregnant. This usually works, although not always. However even if it fails, they go running to the vicious female talk shows in the US that love to load guilt on males to get them to conform. It’s all part of the Orion system. Better to keep them at a distance, but this is only possible with VERY Advanced and Final incarnations. Question 177: However I also get the impression that you might be able to present some advice in dealing with such things. I read the question from the Australian boy, and I have always felt an inner resonance with shamanism/magic, and was wondering if you could 424"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"elaborate on any visualizations/rituals/practices which you think might assist me. By the way, thank you very much for presenting this information, it has been of wondrous service. Answer: It sounds like you've had soul pieces lost to this female and she's probably trapped a piece or two. You do need a shaman to assist properly, although you can try to get them back on your own. I have been Native American trained as a shaman. You could try to call back the pieces yourself by laying down, closing your eyes and talking to any missing pieces by addressing them and asking them to return. Get some sage and smudge yourself with the smoke of the leaves. This will remove negativity around you. Finally, use a gold light to surround yourself and visualize a golden knife cutting any ties you may have formed with this person. Gold light cuts any other color and polarity both Light and Dark. You have started on a spiral up. Keep up the good work! M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 178: Could the DNA-\"commands\" be overcome by ‘fully realizing them and their meaning’ not only within the head but within each cell of the body? From childhood I hated this classification into genders, had problems during my studies (of science) and still have problems with some bosses (male). They seemingly are afraid of women and I am realizing that there maybe a reason for this. I do not want to control others and have them obeying to anything I may want. I really wish a true equality. From what you are writing about women I feel a lot of bitterness but I can also understand it. I tried to contact my Higher Self - there appeared some bright \"energy\" being - but I did not see any oval form. Instead I ended with this being in a room crowded with my former \"lives\". Answer: What you perceive as 'bitterness' is due to Orion tampering and the arrogance of females as a group. Even though this is built in, that is no excuse on their part. Recognizing the DNA commands is the first step, however if the spirit is not mature enough (through hundreds of incarnations), shim will not be able to override the commands. What you see of men \"afraid of women\" is because of the male DNA command counterpart. Those men who seek the approval of females, as the basis for their actions, are under sway of their own commands as per the Orion model. Awakened Final Incarnations live their lives according to what they know and through the input of their Higher Selves. They tend to avoid the masses and the traps and distance themselves from controlling opposite genders. That you say you want 'true equality' is noble, however true equality cannot exist under the current conditions as these human bodies are programmed for female domination. Awakened Finals know this and look forward to leaving this perverted climate. By the time you realize you are a Final, you see the current societal model for what it is and are repulsed by the whole thing. It is so contrary to our REAL selves... our Higher Selves. On that level equality does exist as individual genders do not. If you are in a \"room crowded with your past Hues\", you are within your Higher Self. If you can get outside, you will see the glowing oval. If you are within, you will be either one of the Dominant Incarnations or the Final. If you are the Final, the Dominants will tell you so. If you are a Dominant (only 3 or 4 per Higher Self), you can discuss the Final with the other Dominants. Explore further. Question 179: If freedom is the basis for spirituality, then any entity or group who uses their will to control another, is committing the Number One Act of Violence. Aside from directing a child, there seems to be NO reason to control anyone. We are so incredibly 425"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"conditioned to accept such a violation. Energy vampires seem to be everywhere. Experience with the supposed freedom loving groups, like the New Agers, one would conclude that they are just another control obsessed mass, with a plethora of mini-masters for every occasion. To reflect on the word 'master' leads to the question: Is there any difference between a controller and a master? Answer: The word 'master' has more than one meaning. I avoid seriously using that word. Someone can be a master of their talent, such as a master composer or a master carpenter, but when someone who desires to teach requires the student call him or her 'master', then you have a controller problem and a big ego. Master, being used as controller, has several other names too: governor, congressman, mayor, minister and so on. They control people unless they piss them off to a great extent and the people rebel. The controlling comes from the reptilian part of the brain humans were cursed with. Control is ruled by the planet Pluto and where you have it in your horoscope says where you want control. We need control of self because if you ivon't control yourself, someone else will. The so-called masters of the Light and the Dark societies are controllers. Being aware is a major part of recognizing when you're talking to a controller or not.

Question 180: I have been reading your take on the “human being experience” and am very much in alignment with your explanations across the board. I too have a strong awareness of these truths albeit derived from my own journey to awareness. I have been to Monroe for the gateway program back in 95 and still use the Hemisync tapes for meditations. Although I have never had a OBE. Perhaps that is not within my journeys script. I have done just about every clearing, awakening meditation process available along with thousands of hours with psychics, shamans, healers, etc. As a result I still witness dysfunction and inefficiencies that continually show up in my experience. Answer: Anyone who spends \"thousands” of hours with shamans, psychics, etc is wasting his time and money. These are for consulting and/or healing. If that much healing is needed, there are even deeper problems. Question 181: My moment-by-moment attention to the Universal Laws of Attraction, non-judgment and allowance are a great concept however I observe that some patterns continually appear in my life. I ask that you give me your view on them. I have been a Cross dresser since an early age(i2). I am now 50. I lived with this as shame for most of my life. Looking at it from past life regression, bleed through energy from other life times, control by reptilian implants to early beliefs of not being safe as a male (prenatal origins). 1 accept all of these as part of the experience. Yet bringing my self into a balance has been the challenge. I witness a total dysfunction, emotionally when this cycle shows up. When I express myself in the feminine I feel very relieved yet still I know of the illusion. This is quite acute in the now time. As much as I allow and accept this as part of my experience, the dysfunction of my daily life has grown old and weary. Answer: Cross-dressing is a symptom of gender identity problems (unless strictly for fun or for shocking others). As all spirits are male and female in one, not male OR female, you seem to have other problems. Since you've had no listed success with your 'thousands' of hours with psychics, you probably need some type of analyst. The problems seem to be centered within self. I can't say more on that. 426"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"Question 182: Creating and manifesting: In my early years 20 - 45 I created several companies from inventions I developed. The products were useful. The projects were fun and they all had limited success, prior to ultimate sabotage and failure. Two of them reached $30 million in value before collapse. In 95 I turned in the keys to business and started on a more intense journey of self (higher self) discovery. During this time including the present I have not been able to create new companies. I have attempted to start four company's with four different ideas and they all failed to materialize, I looked for work and no response or answers to my intentions. I have been living on credit for 5 years and am in debt over $isoK. Answer: It sounds like you'll have to go the route of bankruptcy. Such a huge debt is unlikely to be resolved otherwise. You say you 'turned in the keys to business and started an inner journey', yet at the same time you tried to start 4 companies. Hardly eliminating business. You seem to want both the material and the spiritual. They are mutually incompatible. Question 183: Something isn't right in the mix. If it is outside influence (dark forces at work) I wonder why all the work I have put into clearing this hasn't worked. Answer: Yes, you're trying to have it both ways, material and spiritual. This has set up a conflict. You're trying to do too much in two opposite directions. Question 184: I am working on a new start up now and have been since May 2000. The results are still showing up as not being successful at raising funds and continued frustration. The project is in a hot market (energy) and the demand is there for the product, I have the intellectual tools and knowledge to put it together, yet I am continually met with resistance. I hope stating my observation is not attracting more of the same. I really choose to discover my blocks to manifesting and my gender balance. Any suggestion on a consular or coach that may be effective in guiding me? Answer: In order to break a cycle, it must be a clean break. Clinging to business (an Orion trap) will keep you from spiritual development. That's on purpose and why it’s a curse from Orion. You have to let go in order to progress.

Question 185: The information on your web site has helped me to seek information only from my higher self. I am attending a Gateway Voyage Seminar next summer to increase this higher self contact. Robert Monroe seemed to be experiencing a Final Incarnation in his last life time. The fact that he was married to a woman for many years seems to conflict with your experience that final incarnations will not be in a relationship with a person of the opposite gender. Answer: Your assumption that Monroe was in his Final Incarnation is incorrect. He told us of a parallel incarnation he has in Russia doing things similar to what he was doing here. He was not interested in contacting that incarnation. While VERY Advanced, Robert knew his Monroe incarnation wasn't his Final. The Russian incarnation at the same time verifies it. Robert also admitted he had no interest in the occult. A Final Incarnation would never 427"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"say this.

Question 186: I have just finished \"Astral Travel\" by Gavin and Yvonne Frost, and sure enough, I have had a remembered astral dream”a!ready and am expecting I will figure the rest out soon enough. My question is about protection. They have some elaborate protection mechanisms that sound like belief systems to me - especially considering the wicca background of the material. I don't recall Monroe discussing protection at all. What’s the deal on this? Do I need to make a salt circle etc. to be sure that I won't be \"possessed\"? Answer: The Frosts have LOADS of protections in their material. They are very ceremonial. These protections are called keys. The more you do, the more keys your mind has registered protecting you. This is really for novices. The more comfortable and advanced you become with astral travel, the fewer protections you will need. You will know why once you get there. Question 187: Is it my belief in it that will make it work? I am also interested in the effects of wires, springs, synthetic materials, facing east etc. More belief systems? Answer: Actually here, electricity (currents passing through wires/circuit breaker boxes) can definitely interfere with your attempt, especially as a novice. They don't give you these guidelines just to talk - they are very valid. Again, when you become advanced in astral travel, you can overcome these interferences with connections to your Higher Self. Question 188: In my astral dream, I met a lower being who I recognized, but could not place. I went up to him, shook his hand and asked where I knew him from, and suggested a few sources. I must have figured it out, and it must not have been good, because I was immediately slammed back into my body, and I was very uncomfortable for about ten minutes, my astral body not quite reconnecting properly. Although I can't remember our connection, it had a big impact on me, and it wasn't positive. Now I want to go back and find out the deal. Any ideas? Answer: This is your journey, I have no answers for you on this. Your path and journey is VERY individual. This is one reason why dream interpretation books are of very limited value. Enjoy your discoveries both good and bad...they're all experiences. Question 189: A comment you made awhile ago leaves me puzzled, and I'd like to get an expanded explanation about it: \"What has the polarities on edge is they know that once the densities begin to pull up, they will eventually be absorbed into Balance. For example, when the 3rd density ceases to exist, polarities will lose their major playing stage.\" Does 3rd density actually cease to exist, or is it just that 3rd density extensions get pulled into the 5th density higher self after completing their 3rd density experiences? Answer: 3rd density exists only in 3rd density. 4th density (astral) is a mirror, in many ways, of 3rd. There will come a time when 3rd density as we know it, will cease. The EXPERIENCES of 3rd will never cease. The original David statue by Michelangelo will eventually end as a 3rd density creation, but will exist forever as it is stored in the Higher 428"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Selves and can be recreated or visualized at will. So, what gets 'pulled up' into higher densities are the experiences. The physical was only a vehicle to create those experiences, a means to an end and not the end itself. Question 190: Would spiritual energies that complete another spiritual path come to experience 3rd density at another point in the cycle? Or maybe ALL these paths are just extensions of the ONE prime source, amMhereby each are part of an infinite evolutionary feedback system, so trying to understand this from 3rd density perspective is fruitless... (the ceasing to exist of 3rd density seems to be a linear statement) Answer: ALL paths ARE extensions of the Source, but no need to concern yourself over that at this stage. There is FAR more to accomplish here and, even more, on higher densities. Question 191: Also, you indicate that those consciousness units who go beyond 5th density would be involved in creation of 3rd density scenarios, which, if 3rd density ceased to exist, would mean that these higher density spirits are extended themselves \"backwards\" in time from 3rd density perspective. Answer: By 3rd density, from our perspective, I mean OUR 3rd density. You are touching into areas that are quite advanced and more than I want to cover now. However, ALL (in time) will be made quite clear to everyone involved. It’s best to go in stages. Yes, at some time, tue will have the option to create worlds. Monroe talked a bit about this as well. It’ll come to you in time. Question 192: Prior to the 2000 election you indicated that both major candidates represent dark polarity alien interests on Earth. Based on my own research and observations I'd come to the same conclusion, although I'm not fully clear how this control is accomplished. Ordinary Earth humans, it would seem, have free will to choose dark, light, or balance paths of action. “ Answer: We have to walk BOTH Dark and Light experiences in order to reach Balance. Unless you've had incarnational experiences in both, you could not find Balance. Dark and Light are opposite expressions. Both are rabidly controlling as they fear Balance most of all. While the choice to choose is part of the Higher Selves incarnational path, the polarities have been trying to circumvent that choice, especially since all this alien technology has been turned against the populace to get them to conform to the polarities. Control is Dark, but the Light uses it (iron fist in velvet glove, sin/guilt, etc). These are VERY dangerous times due to this - electronic mind controls, fluoride and other chemicals, etc. This is also what is behind the End of the World AS WE KNOW IT. Dark would like us to be like a Star Trek Borg world. Light would like us to be like sheep, mindless followers. BOTH are anti- Higher Self. mm Question 193: In your comments, you said the major candidates will NEVER represent Earth humans' interests on vital issues rather than the ET dark factions. There's lots of information floating around that could explain this, such as the stuff about mind control through ritual abuse & electronic means, 4th density \"reptilian\" consciousness overshadowing people, blackmail and bribery, and the information about clones and doubles from the Andromedans/Collier and the late Dr. Peter Beter. I’d like to hear your take on what 3rd & 4th density means are used to control the puppets who many Earthers ignorantly look to as leaders. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition 429"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Answer: Val covers lots of this on his site, in Leading Edge materials and in Matrix 2 and Matrix 3. Polarities are all about control and denying you freedom of choice. There are different factions within each of the polarities who have their own agendas, so we can see clashes between them fighting over the planet. ALL factions are Orion/Sirian controlled and are looking out for their good, not Earthers. Even if someone who wants to be a politician has good intent, that intent is mutated by lobbies who shower them with money. These people are quickly bought or find themselves not re-elected or dead. Americans are very foolish believing in ideals for this country that are pure illusion. As long as Americans cling to their national illusions, changes cannot be made to make the illusions into reality, but then that's the way Dark designed it and Light is in league with them.

Question 194: If Orions removed 10 of our 12 DNA strands and left us with 2 remnant shreds could not spirit recreate the 10 strands based on memory and operate with them on spiritual level? Once spiritual knowledge is gained of our 12 original DNA strands could these strands be reintroduced in physical form? What would prevent access to imprint memory of the original 12 strands? Orions were not great neurophysicists or metaphysicists: they were gene splicers and thieves. The encoding of the original 12 strands is imbedded somewhere in memory... do you know where? A meta-neurogeneticist could access these strands. Has anyone accessed these 12 strands and published. The encoding on all 12 strands seems to point to multidimensional functioning and knowledge. Thank you for your comments. Answer: Besides the 2 strands of DNA we now have, we have shreds of the other 10 called \"junk DNA\". They are anything but junk. Due to the genetic tampering by the Empire, there are many Higher Selves (Monroe talked about this to a certain extent) who choose not to accept the Earth incarnational challenge. I've talked about that already. There is some talk about the spirit reforming the missing 10 strands, but then these people are more into being their body, which is also a trap. The goal is remembering/rediscovering who you are while still handicapped with 2 strands of DNA. Not until the Game here is over will a restoration, of sorts, occur. The Empire knew what it was doing, but would return and eliminate humans on Earth and, having learned from their errors, create a new human for this planet. This will not occur. You'll have to stay tuned and watch Events to get an understanding of that. Meanwhile, develop connections to your Higher Self and try to overpower the Orion commands. You WILL do it as ALL your incarnations are you. It doesn't matter where you are in this one, ALL ARE YOU. Question 195: Although you have addressed the issue on vegetarianism, can one assume that the Hindu religion is the one responsible for preaching specifically that if you eat meat you will acquire the Karma of that animal, which in turn will set you back in your life’s purpose and any spiritual gain will be lost in this life? Answ r er: The Hindu religion is minion oriented and its karma, caste system and vegetarianism all have roots with the minion incarnations. You can dabble there if you like, but it is a dead end for those with Higher Selves. Notice how Native Americans eat the meat 430"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"to get the power/abilities of the animal in order to advance spiritually. How do you reconcile this with Hinduism? The Native American is Higher Self oriented, while the Hindu is minion group-soul oriented in these matters. Question 196: Also, what about the Karma issue in general? If karma is a bogus concept, would that be why those damned Reptilians have gotten away with screaming bloody murder for all these thousands of years? Answer: As Robert Monroe said, karma is a wheel you can participate in if you believe it. Once you realize that it is just another belief system and withdraw your participation, it can no longer affect you. In reality there is no karma of the type the Eastern religions toot. It is a trap based on ancient reptilian controls to keep Earthers in line. You are correct as to why the reptilians and masters of Earth keep getting away with all their shit. The only type of what you would consider a karma is really instant. For example, stick you finger on a hot iron. Instant karma, you will get burned. There is NO such thing as karma to last into lifetimes. If you believe you are paying for some non-existent past life event, you're only deceiving yourself. Once you dump the karmic belief, as well as guilt/sin, you can progress much faster. Question 197: And last but not least, what do you think of Yoga as a spiritual discipline? All of my yoga friends preach and believe the above aforementioned with regard to being strict vegetarians, no meat whatsoever because of the bad karma thing? Answer: Yoga does have its benefits, for those inclined to adhere to some of its tenets. With all belief systems, you have to use vour Higher Self to sift through the good and the trash in these systems. The mistake is to take the whole, lock, stock and barrel as true. These systems are mixed with some truths and LOTS of untruths. You will have to decide what is for you and what to discard.

Answer: The use of the term 'soul mates' is totally erroneous as your only 'soul mate' can be you in another incarnation, which is not going to happen, since you are to gain experiences by interaction with others, not yourself, in the 3rd density experience. Question 199: How do we reconcile the idea of business and spirituality being mutually exclusive? I have been self employed my whole life, and now that I am getting closer to connecting with my Higher Self, my business is crashing in around me. While I am confident in the ability of my Higher Self to guide me where I need to go, I can't help but wonder how I am going to live without caving in to the Orion commands to make money. I've never been very good at business, and have really embraced it as a means to freedom more than to money. Now the Orion commands are kicking in big time (gotta pay the mortgage!, the health insurance!) and I find myself on the fence, not wanting to go there but not seeing much alternative either. How have you reconciled this? 431"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"Answer: The work I do was chosen by me before I was incarnated. I don't have a reconciliation problem to deal with. I've passed that in previous incarnations. Only your Higher Self can give you the answers you seek on this matter. Don't use my path as yours. Each is individual. What I've done is give my observations and advice. Everyone else is free to accept or reject any of it. What you learn/experience with your current incarnation will help your Higher Self decide future matters. Question 200: I am hoping for some guidance on the astral, but I haven't really gotten there yet (damn those mattress springs!). Perhaps I should separate \"business\" from \"money\". Can a rich person still be spiritual? Thanks! Answer: Materialistic pursuing people, their goal in life is to be 'rich', is their drive for this experience. You can't do everything in one incarnation. Ultimate maturity for one's path comes in their Final Incarnation. Do what you feel comfortable doing most and what other things you wish to do at the level you can. By the way, mattress springs never got in the way for me to astral travel.

Question 201: It had occurred to me that all incarnations are happening/experiencing simultaneously. Therefore, during these simultaneous incarnations, I am experiencing (as another physical body) a number of low and mid, one or more dominant and a final incarnation simultaneously. Time is not linear but we perceive it to be linear. When I die as Joe, it is part of a number of incarnations not the last incarnation except for the incarnation closest to it in a physically perceived time period after Joe's incarnation. Furthermore, if incarnations occur simultaneously and time is not linear, I have already had completed my cycle of experiencing, learning and growth. Thus, my final incarnation, which is the greatest sum of my incarnations is already completed as well and I (true self) will move onward. What do you think? Can you carry this a step forward? Answer: The ONLY final authority on your incarnational path can be you (your Higher Self). Others can offer you a perspective and opinions, but they are just opinions. It's up to you whether or not to accept any of their ideas. There are certain characteristics to Dominant and Final incarnations. If the only reason someone says they are currently one of these incarnations is because they want it to be, it is far from enough. Dominant incarnatioris meet within the Higher Self to decide the Final Incarnation's composition. Remember these are all part of you, like you considering data in your mind when making a decision. The Final Incarnation is the Omega of all your 3rd density experiences and is one's Higher Self in optimum control of the final incarnation before leaving 3rd/4th density for new territories. We have only one incarnation as the personality of Joe, Mary, Val or whoever, BUT the intelligence/immortal giving life to those incarnations lives forever. None of these has more than 1 lifetime (hence the 'you only have 1 life' phrase which is not correctly understood by those who use the term). None of these return, but all of them make up the whole of the Higher Self. If you are a Final Incarnation, you WILL have access to your Higher Self during this incarnation. It may come early, it may come later, but it MUST come if you are a Final. This is something an Awakened Final will fully agree with and understand, so be careful of self- deceptions. No matter what incarnation you are, that's where you need to be at this time.

Question 202: I am new to your information and at the same time I have known it all along. Anyway,'I went through hell to bring myself to this point to finally receive such clarity, as you have obliterated all the bullshit. At the moment I am in a het relationship, and I do admit love and all the rest of the crap still has its hands all over my throat. I've managed to get myself out of numerous dysfunctional friendships and relationships) father of two (6 and 9), happily divorced and satisfied (thanks to your info) have had bisexual experiences and actually never gave a shit about sexual preference or even elevating sex as a primal life initiative (in fact I am sick of the weight everyone puts on it, it's only one small aspect of the shit we’re dealing with). At the moment I am battling with the “save the fucking world” complex (actually you “blew that all to hell”) and all the baggage that comes along with it. Answer: You have a most interesting situation. You are struggling to dump the garbage of 3rd density while trying to be open to your Higher Self. I'm glad you appreciate my directness in writing. There are several keys and clues in my material that only those of Dominant or Final Incarnations will respond to. Words are like tools in your toolbox. Those who would prefer not to hear direct or explicit language are limiting their use of the language. If someone fears/disdains to hear certain words, it’s their problem. Conformism is limiting, but yet independence must be properly channeled into constructive (for YOU) outlets. You also have Dark forces trying to manipulate you and keep you from progressing. The 'kill everyone' thoughts are Dark oriented. These must be pushed away. Everyone has their own path, Higher Self or minion, and you must not let them get in the way of YOUR path. They’ll try, but you have to rise above them. Channeling your new desires into your music is an excellent outlet. You'd do well to smudge yourself with sage, in the way of the Native Americans, to cleanse your aura. Then you need to become relaxed and centered so you can connect with your Higher Self. Black tourmaline is the stone of protection and I recommend people to carry it in their left side or on a silver chain around their neck. Your Higher Self knows what you need, but you need to be centered to get the impulses to help you. Run with the ideas that flow into your mind. You'll know the difference between the polarities and your Higher Selfs flows of info. You are also correct in seeing the far too great attention that sex has with people. Sex, without the proper emotion behind it, is empty. Sex is best with a person you have a spiritual connection with and the connection is made before the sex, not after. You are definitely NOT \"fucked\". You are trying to come out of your cocoon, trying to shed that which has kept your in the dark and away from your true self. You can't save the world! You can ONLY save yourself. Once you have 'saved' yourself (read: awakened), your example will interest others. You have to allow others to follow their own path. Don't let the others get to you. Right now, you need time to yourself to sift through your head and your Higher Self. This requires an inner calm. You have my support! 433"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Question 203: Is it possible to meet the astral body of yourself from a past or future timeline? Answer: An interesting question, but, unless you are a Final Incarnation, you would not even recognize the incarnation. Each incarnation is very into shimself and shim's mission. I have met my Dominant incarnations WITHIN my Higher Self (2 of the 3 are female!). This is above the astral. So, my answer would be it is POSSIBLE, but not likely.

Question 204: I feel abortion is a \"necessary evil\", as anyone can see the world is overpopulated and people don't take responsibility for their actions. You can't kill a soul but Christians can't understand that as they miss the concept of multiple lives. Comments on this? Answer: As I've said earlier, the incarnation does not move into a baby’s body until first breath. In stillborn, there was never a spirit. When in the womb, the fetus is connected and dependent on the mother's system. First breath is the action of the Higher Selfs energy stream moving into the baby. Question 205: In questions 181 and 182 you point out that the spiritual and material are incompatible. I am involved in a field that can offer fame and fortune, yet that is not my motive for being involved in it. I love writing and sharing news and information with people, but most of my colleagues appear to have no interest in spiritual things. I am now 22 and, since the age of 11, I have been trying to find my higher self. I've never associated with any religious organizations because I feel they offer a support group, but not much in the way of spirituality. Are there any publications I should keep a look out for that addresses spiritual issues? We all need a livelihood in this GAME. I am not looking for an external savior, just a little advice. Answer: I don't know of any publications, beside Monroe's trilogy and the 3 Handbooks, that I can recommend. Materialism will counter spirituality if you let it get to be the major drive in your incarnation. BUT do what YOU feel you have to at this stage of your incarnational cycle. Keep checking back to this site. My observations will continue to be posted and my advice is strictly that...advice based on my observations and experiences. Take it or leave it. It won't matter to me. Question 206: I wanted to know, what all this about minions means and the answer was, that, in a way, they are also our brothers and sisters. Answer: I've covered minions in my writings, so I won’t repeat that here. The response that you got refers to all spirit being connected. Not really brothers/sisters as that's gender and not of the spirit but of 3rd density. We are all related is better. The nature spirit realm (animals, plants, rocks, etc) have a very different path to follow than those with a Higher Self. In time, when you progress beyond the difficulties of 3rd density, you will come to understand that better. 434"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 207: Hello. Thank you for your many wisdoms. Most recently you verified what I was only just becoming aware of, the fact that I don't have to take a voyage at TMI to reserve a spot on Focus 27. My place is already there and always has been, thank you! I find myself becoming more and more detached from everything. Sometimes still it is an uncomfortable place to be. Are you ever affected by the moon or coronal masses hitting the earth or HAARP technology? Answer: Thanks for your comments. I’m glad you're progressing on your Path. Electronic/chemical technologies are intended to control people. Val's Matrix III Volume One deals with this in great detail. I recommend the Ti takyon technology that you can wear around your neck to defect most of the electrical interference meant for you. Information on the Ti is found in the back of Matrix V. As far as planetary ejections, lunar or solar, there is not much that can be done. It's all part of the changes happening. Continue working on what you are doing. Your Higher Self has the info you need, so while being aware of the problems you asked about, don't let that stop your progress. As for the chemical controls...avoid fluoride, artificial sweeteners and MSG, just to name some. Val’s site has more info on these matters. Question 208: I've been experimenting with Hemi-Sync and find now that it may not be compatible with me, maybe due to Reiki attunements which is my latest theory. My aversion is to Hemi-Sync not to Robert Monroe. Do you have any thoughts on why this may be? Thank you for your time. Answer: Yes I do, but can't really give details on this here. In my opinion, changes have been made since Monroe left 3rd density. The current Hemi-Sync may not be for you. Have no concern. Your Higher Self will lead you to what YOU need. Keep up the great work. Question 209: Interesting addition here on the shaman/animal spirit thing. It brings up something that I’ve currently been dealing with: I am a genderless spirit currently occupying a 46 year old male body. Answer: You CAN'T be a genderless spirit and have a Higher Self. It’s not the rejection of gender but rather realizing you are BOTH genders. In the Higher Self, both genders are blended into one just as Balance is the blending of Dark and Light. Question 210: I recently had a shamanic session with a woman to assist me “cut cords” of past entanglements (marriage/control). The session went well until at the end I was told I had to go find a snake and hold it because it was my “medicine”. I instinctively recoiled at the thought because, 1) I HATE snakes, and 2) most importantly, my inner voice said this was just another religious belief system that was being presented me. I have sat with this a couple of weeks now, and have not proceeded with the snake thing as I was told. However, I was wondering if my revulsion of snakes is simply a fear I have to get over and if there really is something to me going out and finding a snake to pick up and “be with” that would be spiritually beneficial to me. (maybe something to do with facing a fear directly). Again, my own take on this is “NO”. But I’d like another independent opinion, and yours is one I’ve come to respect. What do you think? If you have more to share here I’m open. 435"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge Internationa! Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Answer: I would never recommend someone find a snake in the wild and grab it and I am Native American trained as a shaman. That you need to eventually overcome your fear of snakes is true, but it should be overcome from within. For example, dumping someone, who has a fear of water, in the deep end of a pool is foolish. It'll only increase their fear. I think the fear of snakes is an ancient fear connected with the reptilians on Earth. That bad advice could have caused you to lose another soul piece just from the shock of what was told to you. To overcome the fear of snakes, read about what they are first. Find out their benefits. Once you have that, if you're up to it, go to a zoo that allows people'to touch a snake. I did that in Kentucky years ago. The park ranger held a harmless snake and allowed people to touch it (feels like a leather wallet). That would help you tremendously. Once you understand snakes and their behavior, your fear will be overcome. It is NOT necessary to find one and grab it. They don’t like that. Question 211: I find the info here fascinating and look forward with each new update, which I digest with great interest. I’ve witnessed much correlation in my own life with personal events and I definitely feel I am seeing the game for what it is now. Regrettably, I continually see much truth to the female/poison/control phenomenon and definitely don’t want to participate in that game. But the fact is, I’m not at a point where I can fully embrace a same-sex sexual orientation for myself. Answer: That's fine and you may never get to that point in this incarnation. Be who you are and proceed accordingly. Don't force something you're not ready for yet. You are where YOU are and that's fine for you. Question 212: This is simply where I’m at and I accept where I am at. The site of a woman 1 s nude body makes me very hot! Men I feel completely neutral about. The sight, the smell, and the moves...of the female, I just find very beautiful, and its something I love. Answer: Yes, this is due to the Orion DNA command structure. This command was not included in the original genetic splitting of Ancient Earthers and had to be added (strongly) in order to get the genders together. Once your spirit advances enough to override this section of the command, you will think differently. Remember, if it's contrary to the First Law of the Universe, it's a perversion. BUT this is something you understand with spiritual progression. Meanwhile be who you are. Question 213: Now, you have told me in the past that these reactions are strictly of the body and the Orion/DNA programming. And I suppose that makes sense intellectually. Yet I wonder, as a male, and having a highly developed feminine side (I am very artistic, affectionate, sensitive, feeling oriented, etc.) might I find this strong attraction to females as part of like attracting like???? In other words, I seem to love those qualities in women that I possess myself. Answer: You are comparing spiritual qualities. If this were true, you'd be gender blind and bisexual which is one step towards the First Law. You aren't ready for that yet. The problem is not with the spirit, it's with the physical. Reread what I've written on that. You don’t need to justify your position, be happy with who and where you are. Question 214: I am seeking more clarity on where I am at and what my true identity is, and more and more I identify myself as beyond gender entirely. Yet, otherwise, 1 seem to have all the tell-tale signs of a final, or at least a dominant incarnation.

All Rights Reserved. me as I x m sure getting tired of the game, and feel ready to move on and would take that option in a heartbeat if given the conscious choice, as my life has become a very lonely one and there is almost nobody I can discuss these things with. And I do hunger and thirst after connection and guidance from my own higher self more than anything, and find myself moving more and more into an observer mode of being. I have written to you before and got good advice of just being neutral and open-minded and see what comes to pass, so I am living my life daily with that attitude. Thanks again for this incredible disclosure! Answer: Whether you’re a Final Incarnation or not is something your Higher Self will let you know. EVERYONE here wants to be considered a Final and that just isn’t true. One can be an un-awakened Final, true, and the awakening can come at any stage in life but not before the Higher Self intends. Unless you get proof from your Higher Self with direct contact and more, you are a wanna-be. That in itself is not bad. It gives you something to aspire to. Being Awakened is a major step and you look at everything differently, including genders, society, sex, fears, etc. See where your path takes you. Each path is very individual. fv/v/v/vpy'pjrvfvfvfvow'rs/^vfvrvrjfvfv/v/v/vfvrwrvfvrv^j Question 215: You recently stated that the seat of the rebel queen power is based in England. This is the first reference that I have seen regarding this. Is it possible to expand on this a little, also I would be interested in your views on David Icke’s believe that the royal family are shape shifting reptilians. Is there perhaps a connection? Answer: Yes, there is a HUGE connection. David Icke’s material is excellent even if it is tainted by a Light sider viewpoint. 1 do recommend his books: Robots' Rebellion, I Am Me, I Am Free and, especially, The Biggest Secret. I recommend bookmarking his web site as well: www.davidicke.com. On David's site, you'll see material available by Cathy O'Brien, Arizona Wilder and Credo Mutwa. These contain more information. Go to www.trance- formation.com for Cathy O'Brien’s site. In her book, when George Bush Sr. turned into a reptilian in the White House, Cathy believes it was a hologram projection. The other way around is more likely. The Arizona Wilder video is the MOST revealing of all with details on the British royal family's shape shifting selves. That the queen of England is the ninhursag (representative) of the rebel queen is found in Robert Morning Sky's material. Robert seems to have vanished off the face of the Earth. If you wish to get deeper into reptilians, I’d suggest getting David's books, Arizona Wilder’s video tape, Cathy O’Brien's book and any Robert Morning Sky materials you may be able to find. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 216: Hello. Thanks can't express it! When will I accept that I already have the answers? Your article on the concept of power animals once again explains why I could never get in to that. I was wondering if the same would apply to the mineral world? Answer: The nature spirit/elemental realms can be worked with. The problem comes in trying to either dominate them or give away your power to them. There are plenty of books that give qualities for minerals, for example: rose quartz is a loving vibration and black tourmaline will protect from magical/psychic attacks. This is part of their purpose. People don't seem to have problems working with minerals, but many do with animal guides. This is because of incarnated animal group soul beings, as I've discusses in the materials. 437"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Question 217: I can't say I was surprised to learn that Hemi-Sync was changed after RAM's death, but I can say I do feel bitterness about it.

Isn't Dark the creator of the beings who produce loosh? I'm not clear on what you mean by Earth planetary spirit. And my question isn't very clear. I see that it is because we are coming from different directions. Can you expand on the subject of loosh? Answer: Loosh is a confusing topic because the word usually sets people off, including me. It is strictly Monroe's term. I have explained the Earth spirit in my material. Dark has nothing to do with Monroe's 'loosh'. It is generated by the Earth spirit when in harmony/balance with shimself. You need to go back and re-read about the Earth planetary spirit. This is the being wrongly called \"Mother Nature\". As far as more on the topic of 'loosh', well, that will have to wait until you get to that phase of your progression. As the shamans who taught me said, 'you must learn patience'. You'll understand eventually. Question 220: Where can I locate black tourmaline? Most all inquiries are met with various: I've never seen that, It's rare, No value as a gem so its \"rare\". And this is creating curiosity in people I ask. Answer: Black tourmaline is NOT rare. I have several pieces that I only paid a few dollars for. Look for rock shops in your area or do an internet search. As far as I know, tourmaline comes mainly from Brazil. Unlike other stones, tourmaline (all colors) has vertical lines on the outside. Tt rarely has a point. They can be small or large. My biggest piece is 5 inches across and the smallest is 1/2 inch. You can go to Maine, but I doubt you'll find any there. In a nutshell, black tourmaline is quite strong. When carried on your left side (incoming energy), it reflects it back to the sender. If the attack is strong enough (usually by a Dark or Light professional), it can cause the stone to break. I've just talked with someone that this has happened to. Other black stones, like obsidian, absorb dark energies, but once saturated, they radiate the energy if not cleaned. This is what makes black tourmaline so impressive. If you ever watch Babylon 5, Mr Morden wears a black tourmaline around his neck. If worn, black tourmaline should be wrapped in silver, the protective metal. 438"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Question 221: I have just recently checked up on your updates, I do so every month, I really appreciate your work, and saw the new couloured drawing of the higher self which is great. But you strongly advise us not to use \"white light\" and the picture of the higher self appears in luminescent white light which tends to confuse me when I work on my connection with it, could it be possible that this could be otherwise, for instance as you suggest for more protection, in golden light? Answer: You’re comparing apples to oranges. The Higher Self is pretty much as depicted in the drawing, but the glow of the Higher Self has nothing to do with protective auras in the 3rd/4th densities. If you want to use white light here, go ahead. Dark will attack white light auras around physical bodies as you're stating you align with the Light polarity. Likewise, Light goes after Dark and their auric color. When one uses gold light, the polarities avoid it as it is polarity bane. Your current incarnation may desire white light for the experience. There is NO protection with white light, just a beacon of alignment. Question 222: Also, about simultaneous incarnations in our space/time illusion which is circular as explained in CWG (book 2 or 3 can't remember) as well as in Monroe's books, and not linear as it appears to us on the 3rd density plane, how about an explanatory image of this \"circular space/time with different incarnations of a higher self in different times periods\", I believe that a picture is worth a thousand words. I have shown your past bigger drawing of the higher self to some of my friends and it has really hit them!!!! It rang a bell in them. But some of them do have some trouble understanding the past/present/future being in the same space and how other incarnations of their higher self are actually now in it. True, they have been into the belief system of reincarnation & karma like myself, but this would really help for a clearer view of the whole thing. Hope you will bear with my suggestions. Unless my understanding of \"circular space/time\" is wrong then correct me, please. Answer: I didn't do the Higher Self drawing BUT the various incarnations are depicted. Each strand of Higher Self is in a different time period (vibration). There are well over 1,000 strands per Earth-incarnating Higher Self, but the drawing does an excellent job. This is VERY high material for Earther incarnates and if it can't be grasped, the incarnation is not yet ready to understand the whole of it. Once ready, the knowledge will unfold like a flower blooming. There is more to that drawing than the obvious for those ready to grasp. Hang in there. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 223: It was mentioned that when it is your time to die nothing can change that. Well, I don’t understand that because what if the human free will does not accept it, does that mean that it is so called overridden? We do have free will choices don’t we? Answer: You don't understand probably because you're not quite ready for it. The Higher Self chose the death experience for that body, BUT the body has it’s own plans and survival instincts (greatly increased due to Orion tampering). It's never been \"human free will\" and the human body is far too greatly controlled by DNA commands. Free will comes from the spirit. Until the spirit has sufficiently matured, the body is in control, BUT the body cannot override the Higher Selfs choice of death for that incarnation. The body knows it's a one time fling for it.

They have some good points, but to sum it up, is this a flaw in giving Terrans help with their Planet or is it a deliberate excuse? Appreciate any info and also what about the Andromedans? To me they feel like a credible bunch! I enjoy their information. What do you think of them? Answer: You'll have to ask Collier about his Andromedans. So far, they're all talk and no action. You can't have credibility when you have no results or actions. SOUNDING credible is not the same as BEING credible. They need to be judge by their actions NOT their words. I remember the great fly-over that never was. You need to direct further questions about them to Collier. Question 226: Can the human body support more than one soul at the same time and is this the norm? The reason comes because I recently had a \"soul reading\" from a psychic and she told me that I had ‘2 souls’. Answer: The answer to your question is NO! Beware of psychics, even well meaning ones. You don't know where they come from. If 2 souls were contending for the same body, you have possession and in this one spirit is overpowered and pushed out to give the second control. \"Soul readings\" sound scamish to me. The ONLY person w'ho can read you spiritually is yourself and you must connect to your Higher Self to do that. NO ONE else can enter your Higher Self but you. Question 227: I have recently read the Books by Lee Carrol on the Kryon Channelings. Kryon is suppose to be the entity that is “responsible for realigning the Earth’s Magnetic Grids to be in Balance with the so called change in consciousness that is to be taking place at the moment”. One of his many points is that “with this new energy shift comes many changes, some that include getting Earth humans to hook up with the missing 10 strands of 440"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. DNA” that I believe you mention that were disabled from us. Also he talks about our so- called contracts in this life and how they can be CHANGED and ALTERED with the proper intent. This would able us to cancel any so called deaths (by contract) as well as disease. Are you at all familiar with these writings and if so can you comment on them? I should mention to that Kryon is mainly concerned with the magnetics of our existence and is very much against the HARRP project in Alaska. Would be great to get your comments on these channels. Answer: Material given through channelers is VERY suspicious because you don't know what kind of spirit is going through the medium. This doesn't comment on the intent of the medium, but spirits can (and do) say just about anything. The Seth material is one of the better ones, but when it comes to channeled stuff, you wind up giving away your power to the spirit. This is something you have to overcome. If I want to find out something bad enough, I do it myself. Kryon (cry on and on) is a favorite of Light-siders. If that's your path for now, do what you gotta do. This clown is too body centric (replacing the DNA strands). It's not about the body or your over concern with death, which is also a body issue, it's about you and your connection with YOUR Higher Self. Unless and until you make this connection, all else is giving away of your power. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 228: The Course In Miracles is a mind programming course, by its own admittance. What I like about it is that it admits that the world and all manifest appearance is a dream, of sorts. This corresponds well with the Advaitic point of view and that of my previous Master, Sri Adi Da (Da Free John, Da Love-Ananda). The Course attempts to get us to realize that we are merely dreaming, that we are Perfect in actuality, that the body does not matter, that we are merely having a hallucination. And that the ego is just a small part of the Mind (lower part of mind, which at some point had an insane thought, that of separation), a fragment that has created an insane point of view, of separation and separateness. The Holy Spirit lives in the Higher Mind (vs. the Lower Mind). That Jesus Christ via the control of miracles collapses time and so connects us to God or Causes a direct connection to the Creator, even if momentarily. And when there is no need for lessons time will cease. But we must give up our will to Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit and allow Jesus to direct the course of the Miracles (which are a collapse in time and are under the direction of Jesus Christ). So we are to give up our will, our desires, and become Miracle Minded (and the internal voice we come to here is Jesus's). And the Atonement is the correction of mere error, not sin. as there is no sin. Just error in our own judgment. And we are to view all of our brothers (and sisters) as perfect, as God has created them, otherwise all we see is the reflection of our own errors and faults, thus reinforcing them in ourselves and our brothers. But if we overlook them when we see our brother, then we are in a sense, allowing a miracle to happen, and our brother is strengthened. You know? I have come off the course and back to the course now three or four times. I can accept it at a certain level. But it still takes a lot to admit that all of this manifestation here in front of my five senses is not real. In the sense that it is a mere projection by our Higher Selves (and the description by one of the students of Monroe in her book portrays this). Instead, I tend to think that it is real, being parts of the Higher Self experiencing actual reality at certain densities and in certain dimensions. Well, the Course, tends to do away with all that kind of theory. It seems to want to bring you to a place where you mistrust your senses and have the \"spiritual\" sense open up and see reality. And in many ways I want to believe this. But I have no confirmation from anyone that’s done it! 441"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Yet, I do with Robert Monroe.! (Well, not yet. I still have to get out of the damn body and notice it!) So...what can you say about all this? Now that you have more data about A Course In Miracles???? Thank you. (The Course will have you forget about all that's happening in this world, just focus on yourself, your ego, the lessons, and so on. Quite isolationist I would say.) Answer: First of all, it hasn’t dawned on you that “Jesus Christ”, as an individual, never existed. He was a literary creation of the Romans who began the historical process of transferring power from secular to religious manipulation, a more effective social control tool. Finding that name connected with the Course tells me a lot. LOADS of Christian icons here besides the non-existent Christ, holy spirit, etc. The \"god\" referred to here is the alien genetic scientists who engineered the current Earth human body. References to being as \"god\" wants you to be is obeying the Orion/Sirian genetic commands. So, my FINAL comment on this would be “not for me.” Giving away your power to ANY fictional or real creature(s) is something you must learn to overcome as all you need is within you. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 229: I have read some Seth Material and It was good for back then but I’m wondering if it still applies today. I’m sure the basics change very little but I’m assuming that much has changed since the 80,s. The fact that their are wonderful Web sites like yours tells me that a lot more information is getting to people who it appears are ready to hear the truth. With this abundance of info makes me wonder who to believe and who not to believe. I try to go with my intuition for starters and without a doubt not everyone supposedly has all the answers. From your perspective was there a group of people or a particular belief system that might have a compendium of knowledge that a person could go to and acquire anything they desired to know without referencing many hundreds of links or different paths. Possibly something along these lines in some of your Web material that I have not come across as of yet? Answer: There is no such organization. Both Dark and Light groups that have knowledge, that counters their positions, is kept secret. This makes what I put on Val's site quite unique in the physical. Question 230: I read some years ago that there was this museum on the astral plane where everything that was and is to be invented is on display there. Is it true? I never been there so I can’t talk. Answer: This is the Library on Monroe level 27. It does exist and can be used by anyone who goes there. Question 231: As far as this channeled Kryon material I mentioned to you, I am not a follower of this path. This channeled stuff is not about that. To me its just information or knowledge. I certainly do not agree with everything I read there. For example there is mention about children born after 1987 who are labeled INDIGO children. I’ve seen this name on some Native American related links and these children are supposed to have special spiritual qualities. Well nothing against kids but I have yet to see that personally. It seems to me that the kids nowadays are less than spiritual. Spoiled, overweight, watch to much T.V. Sorry but I just can’t buy it. At any rate I think you get my drift. I have no children of my own and do not want any. 442"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"Answer: The \"indigo children\" stuff is pure crap. Kids today are the most self-indulgent ever.

Question 232: Hello, I written a couple of questions to you before, I'm learning a lot of things from me since my last couple of questions and I wanted to .ask you something that is happening with me to see if you have anything to say about it. Since I've read your material, I begin to read the Handbooks, I traveled far to the north of my country on vacations and 1 devoted that time to introspection, I'm finishing the third volume of the Handbook and some things are changing inside of me. A lot of times when people come to ask me I have a strange feeling, when I begin to speak, either by voice in face to face conversations or by chat, on ICQ or discussion forums I feel a strange sensation of being here and somewhere else, I can't describe the feeling very precisely with words, but in that moment I say things that later when I read it I can't understand quite well, I feel like I'm definitely say THIS things, and I know that I say this things but I get very confused about the things when later I read it, I surprise of myself saying this things because it seems far more clear than in daily life experience. I am really aware that don't have any kind of medium power, I am pretty sure that this things that I say are from within me, but I just wanted to know if this kind of behavior is normal, I mean, who is talking WITH me when I feel so SECURE to say things that later I'm not so sure? Is it other incarnations of mine? My higher self? Can other parts of me transmit messages to me like this? Or it can't be like that in any way? I appreciate your help. Answer: Although only YOU can answer this correctly, it seems that your Higher Self is coming through. If the Higher Self has something to give you, shim will. This type of communication is very different from a channeled one. Your Higher Self is VERY potent and when you reach very Advanced incarnations, shim can pulse information to you easier. Enjoy your development. Question 233: Does everyone have a Higher Self? Answer: Everyone does NOT have a Higher Self, but that is covered in my materials. MOST are minion incarnations. You must carefully read ALL my materials for that. Keep researching. Question 234: What is the purpose of the Dark type? I guess I’m just trying to figure out what the dark type is trying to do? Do they think they are on a winning side? Are they using the dark for power? Answer: You might as well ask what is the purpose of Light. In a Higher Selfs progress, shim has been BOTH Dark and Light. In order to become Balance, you MUST have been both polarities. Power is like electricity, it is. HOW it is used depends on the user. Both polarities believe they are THE winning side. In reality neither can win since both will eventually merge to become Balance. Also, there are Dark and Light shamans and even a 443"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"(very few) Balance shamans.

Question 235: I am in the process of completing my reading of Monroe's second book of the \"Journeys” trilogy ( Far Journeys ). I have read much of Icke's \"Biggest Secret\" book. I feel as if I am in limbo at present. A deep state of depression has set in, though not to such an extent as to want to induce suicide. I do feel like 'spiraling out', but for what reason? To end the pain? That isn't exactly a constructive excuse. Something in me just says I don't really care if I were to die on the spot or whenever. And thus, after reading Monroe's two books, it becomes more blatant to me that fear of death (and the consequential 'survival' drive that arises from it) is what motivates me to keep the body alive, but it must also provide a buffer against soul impulse and intuition (for the want of a better term). I also read with interest the following passage from an article called Fear The Mind Killer: \"Making a somewhat desperate end run around this problem, shamans figured out that by tracking back through human fear they could find the big one, which, if eliminated, would make the most difference. Needing to understand themselves and their world they sought outside its normal parameters, they flew in the face of death and learned something very important to the way of the shaman. They found that death itself was the big enchilada. Coming back from that doorway to eternity they discovered that coming face to face with their own physical annihilation had brought them to a place of profound detachment. The intimate knowledge and acceptance of their own deaths had erased fear.\" Is this what is necessary for so-called advanced souls after a certain point of seeing the Game for what it is and wanting to spiral out? I don't feel particularly moved to do so at this stage of the journey. Answer: You didn't say why you are depressed, although indications are because you've discovered that things aren't what you thought they were. You have to examine if this state is caused by the body or by the spirit. The physical will react in such ways to an advancing spirit. I wouldn't care if I dropped dead today, but my reasons are I have MUCH better things to accomplish without the body and 3rd density Earth. By the time of Final Incarnation, after the Awakening, there is no concern for death. It's the body that has this tremendous fear as it realizes once dead, that's it for the physical. It will NEVER come back, hence the survival instinct. This was heightened by alien genetic scientists in a move to suppress the spirit. As the spirit progresses AND receives higher information (that shim can handle at the stage shim is in), the spirit starts to override DNA/bodily commands. Everyone's path is unique set by your Higher Self. You can gain guidance from without, but your ultimate source is within. That you are not yet ready to spiral out of the Game is fine...for YOU. When you read material you are, at present, unable to handle, just push it aside for another time. Reading it, becoming aware of it, has started an irreversible process within your Higher Self, however, and manifestation WILL occur. Question 236: Years ago, I used to think that maybe a Near-Death Experience was what I needed to alter my perspectives on life and death. But that seems to place dependence on randomness, chance and externals, rather than taking the \"road less travelled\", taking responsibility and trying to induce OOBE similar to what Monroe has done, IF that is what 444"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. someone feels called to doing in order to assist in overcoming fear of death. Perhaps at this stage, it is necessary for me to simply 'unplug' from attachments or addictions to physical manifestations (e.g. feminine beauty), and try to live more in the present. Answer: So-called 'feminine beauty' is a HUGE illusion. Females in the West, and especially in North America, are illusion - make-up/glitter/dyes/colors/shavings/nail polishes/enhancements, etc. Females live a lie in this. They conveniently blame males. This is victimhood. That you believe in such a concept as 'feminine beauty' shows you have not yet learned to strip away the illusion. Also, anyone hung up on physical beauty IS still body ruled. This becomes totally clear by the Final Incarnation. Move at YOUR pace and NOT anyone else's. Don't compare your progress, or even lack of progress, to anyone else. It's not a matter of conformity, but of individuality. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 237: I need to have some clarification, this time about the subject of Reiki. I have been a reiki practitioner since '94, passed the 3 levels, and along the way, also attended a number of workshops with a \" Certified Body Mirror System Healer\" trained by Martin Brofman ( a light sider). Been a member of TMl for a number of years as well , never could afford to attend one their programs, being from overseas, but worked at home with the Gateway Experience tapes, so far only completed Wave I, starting Wave II, read RAM's trilogy, Far Journeys (8 times), Ultimate Journey (6 times), ROMC's Cosmic Journeys, Bruce Moen's three books, as well as all of his website, and thanks to VML was recommended your web pages last year. Now, about Reiki, when I first started to receive reiki energy for a very painful sciatica, I was at first very skeptical about all this, but anyway the result was that my sciatica completed stopped after two weeks of treatment, although I had tried all sorts of anti-inflammatory medicine. So I decided to pass my attunements. Started to practice in a reiki center, belonging to an association of which I became a member. But I could not go along with the cult personalities about the Grand Reiki Masters, this annoyed me! I had already broke away from the catholic religion, and was very wary of any other belief systems. While practising regularly reiki on people, I slowly notice a change, every time I started to put my hands on the patient, a vibration would run through me, I even looked at my hands to check if they were shaking, but no, this was internal, I could feel the energy passing through strongly, asked the others if they had observed the same phenomenon, and was just told \"that this was only because I just came from the outside, and it was stress\", I thought \"bullshit\". Then I started practising with my inner guidance and this annoyed the others because I was not doing this \"the way the masters taught it & the way it should be done\" I got disapproving looks! So I quit this reiki center, and decided to explore further the effects of reiki or whatever channeled energy it was at my place. Arranged a room specially for this and continued with a very few friends of mine. I also started to experience vibrations going all through the body and going out by the feet to the floor. I felt as if all of the body cells were vibrating, then this kept happening especially when I woke up at night or in the morning. Every time I started a reiki treatment, I felt/saw this \"milky golden\" energy ray coming down through the crown chakra and passing through my hands onto the patient along with the vibrations. Now I got used to this. The vibrations are within me all the time. Then I read your material, and I thought, aha, where does really come this energy???? 445"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"So I changed my approach & intent last year before each reiki treatment. I mentally visualized myself and the patient, first, each in a golden resonant energy balloon, mentally connected myself to the Source, then told the person to mentally connect shimself with its Higher Self while I did the same after I had shown him/her the higher self drawing, used the affirmation \"What's next for me? Show me what I need to know & experience, & lead me to whom I need to meet\", and called our friends THERE/other aspects of us to guide me during the treatment, well, WOW, the energy was so different, so much more powerful that even at times it became almost unbearable for my physical hands. The receiver also felt a lot of difference compared to \"before\", and I noticed inner transformations of the different persons that came regularly for balance. I asked them to give me some feedback if they noticed any changes in themselves after these. Now I am thinking of wearing a black tourmaline at my left side & putting one on the patient's left side as well during a treatment. Only a very few persons come to me for these reiki treatments, about five (I don't charge for treatments or attunements). I got rid of the others who use to come only to be pampered and did not make any changes in their way of thinking, directed them to other reiki practitioners, which is fine with me & them. I feel as though I am connected to another level of energy than before. I would appreciate your comments on what is really happening. It's been a very lonely rocky road for years for me, getting smoother now but still lonely at times. Apart from doing this energy work and taking time to have fun, I have become quite bored with THE GAME. Thanks for taking the time to read this long post and to reply to it. Answer: Since everyone's Path is different and tailored to them, all I can say is you’re having experiences unique to you. Since they are not my experiences, I can offer no other comment except to keep moving in the direction you are and rely on your Higher Self. See where you are taken. Yes, the rocky road is MOST lonely...T know. You seem to be surrounded by people who prefer the Game to spiraling out. Now, it's ok that they want to do this, but they also seem determined to keep you on THEIR lower path, which is not ok. Knowledge is one thing, but unless that knowledge is applied, it is of minimal use. The \"oh, I know about that, but I just can't apply that to my life...what would my partents/partner/friends/etc think?\" If one is STILL living their life for others, they have far to go.

Question 238: Could you elaborate on transitory a little more? And how that relates to Dominant or Advanced (think that's the word you used) incarnations. Answer: Transitory refers from one stage (mid-levels) to a higher stage (Advanced). Not 'dominate' but Dominant. I cannot say if anyone is Dominant or Final except with my own Higher Self. My comments on incarnational stages are guidelines. ONLY you can find out where you are in relation to YOUR Higher Self. Transitory does NOT relate to Dominant or Advanced Incarnations. Transitories can be from low to mid-levels as well as from mid to Advanced levels. A transitory indicates a difference from where you were to where you are now. An Awakened Final incarnation has THE major transition from pre and post Awakening. You must commune with you own Higher Self for more information on this. 446"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"Question 239: I'm a 48 year old female with a 5 and 8 year old, gone in and out of the polarity game all my life (mostly for trying to please family/friends). Religion never made any sense to me, still does not. I've read all the Handbooks, Transformation of America, have been on Achyara's list since before she wrote the book, never read any of Monroe's books (although now that I’ve read your material, I will), been perusing Leading Edge site for over 4 years now (it was one of the first I found while surfing) and always \"felt\" the balance in Val's work. Purchased and read Alex Collier's book and found some new material that was helpful, been receiving David Icke's E-Zine since it's inception, nearly 2 years ago. The previous said to give a bit of my background of understanding, I know I'm not a final since I still find sex with a woman distasteful, but I'm finding sex with men also distasteful which will probably end my current het relationship (not the kids' father) in the near future. I've always thought the manipulative ways women deal with men very disgusting and never developed that ability or desired to (grew up in a very patriarchal family), have never fit in, never followed a guru or wanted to, been in a variety of life situations, followed my own nose through it all and after having my second child, found myself spiraling up, out (had another series of awakenings) and losing all my material accumulations (good riddance), and coming back home to Mom (rather than be homeless with 2 kids). I now realize the spiritual drain having children is, yet I made that choice (their dad doesn’t help...he didn’t want them, I did). What I really want to do now is to have time alone, contemplate, meditate, contact my higher self. Yet with children who I now homeschool (true to Cathy O'Briens unveiling of the Global Education 2000, dumbing down the kids...public school is becoming very bizarre), there is no time to do this even though the time now is so very critical (2012) in this Earthly existence. Now I know I would not be in this scenario had my higher self not wanted this experience, yet I feel so not a part of this world and have no interest in the game. I do want to have my own cash flow (and am furiously working at that currently) so as not to be dependent on anyone to take care of my children and myself, beyond that money holds no fascination for me. Answer: You are in a transitory incarnation, from what you said above. You are experiencing the consequences of breeding and must see that through. Yet, you have new desires to progress. This is very transitory. Time IS short. You will gain what you need to influence other incarnations of you in other time streams. Your Higher Self needs some of this information, so you are pulled to the site. The information needed is being sent to your Final. Keep progressing at YOUR rate and not what others may seem to be doing. Question 240: My higher self prompted me to look at Val’s site for 5 days and as soon as I found your materials, knew that was the purpose. I get promptings but not clear contact. Now I realize, I had been falling back into a light polarity as has happened quite often in this lifetime. Thanks to reading your material, I have come back to my senses. Val's site (and David Icke's info) has done that for me many times. I find it difficult to get into anything or accomplish anything and would like to know how to obtain clear messages from my higher self to know where I'm to head with the rest of this lifetime (currently practicing your method of connecting). Is the search for our life's purpose another deceit we've been fed by the light polarity? I've always felt as though I had a purpose in this lifetime, but it still eludes me. I've honed my discernment but as you say, our own higher self is our best source of info. Without the ability to have true communication with our higher self, what is the next best way to learn our own truths? Hope this doesn't sound like whining, your material prompted so many questions.

Question 241: The other day I had a dream, in this dream the earth was going to its limits. I feel, from this dream and things that I been feeling that the Earth will be part if (not all) responsible for human reduction, I almost can feel a red, hot, and vague image/sound of the time coming, I could feel it in my dreams, yesterday. I woke up pretty scared and wrote the dream on paper. Is this just a dream or maybe I'm paranoid, but will be earth responsible for the things that are coming? (I know that humans and controllers are the responsible ones. I'm talking about the situations that are coming). The last but not less important question, there will be a war soon? I hope these feelings of mine are wrong, but I got used to listen to it. Answer: MANY people are having similar dreams, including me - tidal waves, quakes, volcanic eruptions, etc. The Earth spirit is VERY pissed and is one of the Wild Cards I've talked about. Time will tell if your dream will come true, and time is short. A major war is another Wild Card. That you fear war shows you are body attached. When you become detached from the body ID, you will not fear anything. Question 242: I've read all your articles and have found them to validate my own Inner experiences of the high Self. I have a question for you. On the Inner Levels are you getting the information about the Alien stuff, or is it from Zechariah Sitchen, and David Icke?

David Icke, Credo Mutwa, etc (who I refer to) have much important information in print and are good sources for those who cannot astral travel and discover on their own.

I was trained to be a Past Life Reader, in the 3 year program in the School of Metaphysics. I taught & directed the Chicago school back in the 70's so inner work is not new to me. And doing it with conscious awareness and trance state, writing etc, I have done for over 30 years also. But on the inner levels I've never \"seen\" a sign that says \" you are now on the 20th level\" etc. I may get in a dream or meditation that \"I'm working from a certain level\", so I trust that information when I receive it.

Question 246: Concerning the protective rituals in Gavin and Yvonne Frost's book Astral Travel: Once the circle has been drawn, having conducted the accompanying ritual, and you place your mattress over it; is one to stay strictly inside the circle or does the mere presence of the circle serve as the protective force ? In other words, is it safe to allow a part of your body, say your feet for instance, to extend beyond the perimeter of the circle while you are astral traveling? Answer: Obviously if you have drawn a protective circle, and you dangle beyond the circle, you are outside its protection! Question 247: I had an experience a few years back and have been seeking answers about it.... I was trying for an OBE lying in bed, then I felt like I was leaving my body, then I saw a type of monsters face something like the creature in the movie \" Big Trouble In Little China. The face was frightening and in my mind I cried out for Jesus Christ. After that episode I felt for a day or so like I had some essence of Christ. I was not into Christ but guess I used him to help me. You say and I believe the Christ thing to be bogus. Answer: The whole 'christ' thing is pure bullshit and, like karma, exists ONLY if you believe it. The lower and mid astral has lots of minor entities created from fears. If you got into the astral with your fears, you will be confronted with them. Any more than that and you'll have to discover on your own. The Q&A's are for further clarification of the material, 449"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"not for personal interpretations. Overcoming your fears is paramount. You cannot advance to higher realms or spend any serious time in the astral as long as they control you.

Question 248: In the text, you mention the division of the bodies in 2 genders as an invention of the Empire for the slavery of humankind and to prevent spiritual advancement. Why is that all and every animals on this planet has 2 genders? Answer: Animal spirits come from an entirely different type, a group soul, rather than a Higher Self being. Each has a totally different area of experiences. You will only understand this when you have reached higher densities and advanced in them. Question 249: Did the empire divided the animals into genders on this planet also? Answer: No, it is the way of the nature spirit group soul. Question 250: Where all Animals here come from? Or, there are animals here from other parts of the universe? Answer: There are animals native to Earth and there are creatures that are genetic experiments (mosquitoes, for example) by aliens. There are also a few that originated on other systems. It is popularly believed that dolphins are one of these. Question 251: Is the belief that dolphins are “spiritually advanced teachers” true? Answer: No, dolphins are not what they say they are. People should be more concerned with their Higher Selves and their own Path and not be so wrapped up in the nature spirit realm. Question 252: Yesterday I had a lousy day, and I really sorry about my behavior, I would like to comment on something and just see what do you think about it. Recently, and I mean the last couple of days, my life turned from happiness to something really painful and sad (that's something I would take responsibility on, I'm not going to deny my actions) but MAINLY people from work, friends, all around me, just TURNED TOO VIOLENTLY against me. I don't know how to say it correctly, I'm still learning English, in work in the last recent days I worked MORE than I do in the past and PEOPLE are MORE aggressive with me than before, my partners in work are trying to manipulate situations, of course, I'm the ONE with ‘all the problems’. In my daily life, my EX-friends don’t talk to me either, and later I've been told that they are making fun of me and my statements of aliens, higher self and even my own dreams. So I would like to ask you, is there any reason why the behavior of people turns out too aggressive with me? It is really hard to manage to overcome all this aggressiveness all around me sometimes. Thank you so much for listening to me. Answer: As I've said in my materials, once you start to process the information I've given AND change your life accordingly, those who wish to remain in The Game will turn on you. It is a very lonely path once you decide to walk it. They will be terrible to you until either conform or they know you don't care what they think. Spiraling out is not easy. Everyone I know who is has similar problems then spends most of their time alone.

Great stuff (AS USUAL) I have a question. Which technique do you recommend for confronting fears or changing them or transforming them? Answer: First you must understand what you fear. Next is why. Read up on the topics that cause you fear and go from there. Question 254: You’ve mentioned Robert Morning Sky's LA Transcript several times but I’ve still not found the link or anything about it? Answer: Morning Sky's web site is http://home.earthlink.net%7Emorningsky . There is no new material there but he has his materials there and you should be able to get the excellent LA Transcript from him here. Question 255: Concerning Dr. Steven Greer's Disclosure Project, it seems as though he’s failing to consider the presence of the negatively polarized Orion faction and has overlooked their preference for subterfuge, as you've revealed. Be that as it may, is the May 9th media event and May 12 th symposium some manner of conspiracy disinformation/misinformation ploy ushering in the inevitable overt presence of these beings? Answer: I am unfamiliar with Steven Greer or his Project, so I don't know what you're talking about here. Question 256: I have read all the material and it is fantastic. You have spoken about certain \"wildcards\", which brings me to the sensitive nature of my questions. I feel, not by ways of Orion programming — but rather, thought the HS, that I am one of the \"wildcards\". This is the clarification and/or assistance I require (confirmation). Your information has thrown a wrench in the works (an impressive one at that), which has sent me spinning deeper into the outer edges of the game. I am on a very strict path, by ways of the IIS — stricter than most other HS, and I require some insight to help \"fine tune\" this fine line I am walking (experiencing). It appears that you have come across my path at this time and the timing is right on the money (if only there were any — HA!) as I am ready for the material and more of what you have to share. \"All in due time\" as they say. Now is the time. 451"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"Answer: My use of the term ’wildcard' refers not to any individual person, but to events, such as alien, Earth changes, etc. I would not consider any person alone to be a wildcard. Something also to consider, if you were to do something requiring money, your Higher Self would see you had the way open to you. If it were not something your Higher Self required, it is an option apart from your Path. If the time is 'now', the way would be available. Question 257: Your material has altered my consciousness quite fruitfully and has now brought me to a crossroad. It is a matter of continuing on in my journey, which at times I feel is a waste of my valuable time and energy due to the muggles (minions) inability to use their brains and think for themselves — and dropping it all while leaving the responsibility well enough alone cause it really isn’t my problem — this floating prison colony we so bravely call our home -- HA! I have, on numerous occasions, told my HS to go fuck itself due to the painful and suffering-filled pressure of the narrow path I am on. I am sick and tired of having no choice and to know r that I can really drop everything gives me great relief, if this is something I really can do. The only problem is, and what I mean by having no choice, is that each time I step off this narrow path, be it intentional or un, I get stung. What the fuck gives? I can’t win! This issue is SO COMPLEX. Answer: Everyone always has a choice, except in the manner of death which YOU chose before incarnation. You have to avoid being the victim and wearing the mantle of 'oh poor me’. Examine your choices and desires. If you're doing something for others because of them, at your expense, that's Light polarity. But, even so, it still may be part of your Path and experiences. I'm glad my material has helped you. Work with it as much as you feel drawn to it. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-200TLeading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 258: When you traveled to 2200 and beyond and saw oceans and land but no plant or animal life on the land, is it possible that there could still be life in the oceans at this point? Also, what about inside the Earth's crust (so called center of the Earth)...is it possible that there are still beings residing there(humanoid type and others....example: the beings spoken of in the ancient \"Shamballah\" stories) at 2200 and beyond? I'm looking forward to 2012 (not sure if there will be a meteor/comet, mass consciousness shift or whatever...I will see)...I want to see what happens in this \"experience\". Answer: I didn't move into the oceans, so I can't say. Same with the Earth's interior. My opinion is that all life has been removed from the planet to make way for the return of pristine Earth. Question 259: Regarding moving to level 27 and beyond to 34/35 (where the Higher Self resides)...I can tell that the Monroe tapes/institute would be a good way to achieve that. However I'm not sure what types of costs we're talking....I know that I'm talking a limited budget for myself. I am currently reading his book(s) and find them extremely helpful. Are there other ways to achieve \"controlled\" experiences with the library on 27 and beyond to 34/35, other than Monroe's materials/institute? I do have many astral experiences but would like to master the control of these experiences. I am being very patient with myself and I know that all things/answers come when I am truly ready. Thanks again for the Matrix V material...it's needed NOW. Feedback is appreciated. 452 I"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"Answer: The Institute does not sell tapes that will take you higher than level 12, which is what is needed to access the Higher Self IF you are meant to. Monroe blazed the trail on the astral, so his tapes serve as road maps. You can't get to somewhere unless you know how to do it OR have someone take you there (don't ask). You can try willing yourself there just based on Monroe's books that you’ve read. Your Higher Self will assist IF you are to succeed. Don't get frustrated with yourself. If it doesn't work now, don't give up, but don't stress about it. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 260: I recently ran across an 'interesting' person by the name of Stewart Swerdlow, who claims to be one of the Montauk \"boys\". His website is www.stewartswerdlow.com He has a \"Healers Handbook\" and details the use of colors. Some alarm bells were going off when he said \"white is the highest color, and can be used for protection\"! Also he says the best form of protection is a bubble of violet light around you with a mirror covering. My discernment tells me that The Gold bubble is the best for me, and I have had great success with it as well as with sage. Additionally he says that green is the color of the heart chakra and that one should visualize green when breathing in. This seems wrong to me intuitively, especially with the fact that green is often associated with attacks of the solar plexus. Do you have any opinion on Stewart Swerdlow and his information or possibly dis-information. I believe he is aligned with the government (still) and is sprinkling truth within his lies. Also do you have any comments on his color work? I would truly appreciate your perspective! Answer: I wrote to Swerdlow once on the gay issue. I use that to test self-proclaimed pillars of knowledge. He gave me such a nebulous answer that I knew he was most likely being used. I, too, find his colors off. Why would someone do that? The best way to halt your progress is to feed you disinformation. Take his \"white is best\" example. That indicates polarity. Green is the color of the solar plexus and pink is for the heart. Of course people can use whatever colors they feel comfortable with, but I've found these are standard and always work for one's benefit. Go with what works for you, but keep a wary eye out for people like Swerdlow. Another one to beware of is Cosmic Awareness. I call that person \"Unawareness\" and is definitely a manipulator even if the human channelers are wonderful people. Unless information is verified by your Higher Self, be cautious. Question 261: Are there deeper allegoric meanings here? I am a polygamous man searching for truth, and have two wives, one of 30 years and one of 2 years. All of us are fifty-two years old. The thirty-year marriage is in trouble, very sick from many things, especially the wife's resistance to nonconformity and her lack of \"demonstrated\" spiritual growth despite the rhetoric that comes forth from her mouth. The wife of only two years is the woman I was always searching for. She is also just as accepting of change as I am and just as diligent in her search for truth. I have continually been sexually active with both women, being with one or the other of them almost every day. The sexual intercourse with my wife of two years has been far more frequent, sensual, erotic, inventive, open, and free. The wife of two years bought Matrix 5 for me and I have been studying it with her. I fully understand what I have read so far, and comprehend its sexual implications, as does the wife of two years once I explained it to her. Now for the rest of the story. Since beginning to read M5 with my wife of two years, and learning of the First Law of Creation, the Law of 453"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"Attraction, I have been much slower to get erections, and have frequently lost them during intercourse with my wife of two years. However, with my wife of thirty years who has no knowledge of M5, sexual intercourse has remained unchanged with firm, hard erections that consistently lead to normal ejaculations. Any ideas about what is going on here? Is this the power of M5? Answer: Yep, the power of M5 on those who read it. M5 will strengthen ties to the Higher Self and you will look at everything differently. That an erection is possible with the one who hasn’t read M.5 is significant. The body ID is still there. All this is VERY good as progress and outward spiraling is evident. Hang on, it's going to get even more interesting. This is VERY good. Question 262: Is it \"NECESSARY\" or beneficial to experience, even if only for a short time, these alternative lifestyles in order to accelerate getting to the Higher Self? Answer: Each Higher Self has shim's own individual Plan for experiences desired on 3rd density. Each plan is unique. Everyone can have some similar experiences but no one has the exact same experiences or growth. You can be a mid-Advanced level hanging with a Final and an upper mid-level. The combinations are endless. The error is to compare where you are in this incarnation to someone in a seemingly more Advanced incarnation. You, at some times in your incarnations, will be gay, lesbian and bi. If you are not now, don't be concerned about it. Don't play a 'keeping up with the Jones'. All things work for you when you are ready at the time appointed by your Higher Self. Don't force an issue, let it unfold when you are ready for it. Question 263: Is it necessary to experience homosexuality before achieving asexuality? Answer: There IS no asexuality in the spirit world. That is a lie started by Eastern religious myths. You can have asexual incarnations, but they are dead ends. This will become clearer as you progress. Remember all the readings of M5 are registering with your Higher Self and this vibrates through all your Advanced incarnations wherever they are in 'time'. Question 264: Is asexuality even a final endpoint for the spirit in this third density incarnation? Answer: To progress you will eventually discard the idea that 'asexuality' is advanced. Question 265: From what you have been told, does it seem to you that my newer wife is progressing to higher spiritual levels? Answer: Progress is very individual. She is doing it at her own pace, but has body control issues. The succubistic nature of clinging to a man shows MAJOR body ID and body domination over spirit. When the spirit is Advanced, shim knows no body dependency is needed for you are whole in yourself. She should not judge where she is by where you or anyone else seems to be. Question 266: What kind of incarnation does she seem to be to you? Answer: A developing one, BUT she has interests in advancing and should pursue them at her own rate. You can't 'save' anyone. They must 'save' themselves, as I say in M5. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 267: Tattoos would seem to be a \"body (physical) thing\". I have a close friend with whom I exchange information on our search for truth. She has always wanted a tattoo, but did not do it because of fear from religious and biblical teachings. We now understand that all religion is about mind control and deception, and have recently gotten away from it. To destroy our tampered DNA codes, we are both on a quest to become as nonconforming as possible. What is your opinion about tattoos as an act of \"non­ conformity\" and rebellion against such religious mind control? Would you consider this to be a valid form of \"un-programming\" for her? Answer: I would never get a tattoo due to the needles and injections. If you wish to get one, that is totally your decision. No right or wrong there. I would not get one on any chakra point (front or back) as that can interfere with the chakras operation, especially the major 7. Question 268; Are you aware of any little known effects from tattoos that would interfere with her energy fields or hinder the process of getting to higher states of consciousness and awareness? Specifically, she is considering a large tattoo in the small of her back. Answer: The small of her back is close to the genital chakra. It may interfere with the operation of it. If she's down that far, she might consider, IF she really wants one, to get it on her butt. But do whatever you like. It's all about experience. Question 269: You state that the Higher Self reaches a state where It designs galaxies and 3rd density events. If 3rd density is a level where the Game (the illusion) takes place, why would the Higher Self want to create it? Answer: You will be given this information when you have advanced to the point where you are ready to receive it. The answer will come from YOUR Higher Self. Question 270: Where can I find information on the history of DNA sequencing in regards to the Orion (female) and the Sirian (Male) Empires? Answer: The only place I know who had published any material on that is Robert Morning Sky and the book you'd want is: Eden, Atlantis & the UFO Myth - Book II of the World's Oldest Religion. This has been out of print for some time now. You might want his 'LA Transcript' which does talk a lot about the genetic scientists manipulation of Earthers from the Orion point of view. Question 271: I have never had a conscious Soul Travel experience. I have ordered the Astral Travel course by your friend's the Frosts. I greatly desire the experience, any advice? Answer: It was Gavin & Yvonne's course that helped me learn to astral travel. PATIENCE is a key. Patience with yourself. It took me 6 months before I got the breakthrough. Question 272: The Higher Self Meditation (in Matrix 5), the Crown Chakra mantra (CONNECT) is very powerful. Can you provide additional techniques for connection? 455"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"Answer: Nope...that's all I can share at this time. That meditation is what I use every night no matter where I am. Keep up the progress. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved, Question 273: I couldn't help wonder if your visions/inner plane experiences were influenced by Monroe's work. That is, auto-suggestion. I wonder if you would've \"seen\" This multidimensional schematic without having read his books? Answer: That could be considered IF I only saw what he saw. When I send people up to the Greek pantheon of Focus 25 ,1 tell them some of what they see. They report much more than that. This is when I know they've been there as they tell me things I've seen there but didn't tell them before their journey. Monroe blazed the trail and placed guideposts. That’s enough to tell you. You're on the right track. Question 274: The concept of minion spirits sounds so cool...even though it's to our detriment. But how/where do \"indigo children\" fit in (if this is a real phenomena)? Answer: I think the phony \"indigo kiddies\" began with Michael Scallion, who has since disappeared, so it seems, as no one hears of him any more. The key people do not inhabit this group, but rather the Baby Boomers group. The indigo bullshit is a red herring. Today's children are the most violent/disturbed ever, as a group. Question 275: The specific information regarding genders/gender splits very clearly states the conflicts caused as a result of the gender split and I have noticed this for a long time and the Matrix V information brings things into even better focus. It is time to move past the bullshit and the agendas being pushed by the polarities (whether terrestrial or extraterrestrial) of this planet (\"alien invasion\", \"aliens running the planet\", \"follow me I'll save you\", \"this group is right/this group is wrong\", etc.). I am very aware that my true nature is unlimited and that through my experiences. I will continue to access more of my \"potential\", which is unlimited. Ancient Earthers were split into two genders. They contained the \"parts\" for both male and female and produced at will (containing both the life giving sperm and the egg \"matrix\"). The ancient Earthers appeared similar to the current male bodies except for the genital area, which appeared similar to the current female vagina, except the being contained active/working parts of what we today call male/female. When these beings made decisions to reproduce, how did they \"nurse\"/feed their newborns? If the beings appeared as males and did not have the swollen mammary glands of today's female, how were the newborns fed? Answer: I have not investigated that. Since I received all the information that I was interested in, I am satisfied. If anyone wishes to pursue questions like yours, you can get your answers either from astral time travel or in the Library on 27. Question 276: You state that certain countries (ex. India/Africa) contain a lot of minion incarnations. I can see this clearly by the \"out of control\" birth rates in these poor nations. Regardless of the conditions, people keep having babies. It is obviously minion reproduction for \"food\", \"slaves\". However I do have a question about the subject of \"blacks\". The author does make it known that blacks are being destroyed/killed in large numbers by the controlling forces of the planet. Many 3d beings \"destroy\" something out of 456"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. fear or because that \"thing\"/\"being\" is blocking the way to a specific goal. For what reason are the controlling forces destroying \"blacks\"? Answer: From their point of view, it would be like throwing away something that is of no use to you any more. The black race was engineered for manual labor, necessary at the time. While the aliens and their allies are concentrating on the blacks at this time, it's just the beginning. They would like to eliminate all Earther humans and replace them with a totally different kind of being that will obey AND not allow Higher Self incarnations. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 277: Could you comment on the Native custom of smudging? Answer: The vibration of the sage smoke will drive away polarity energies, primarily Dark. Both Dark and Light attacks are black in color. Sage smoke disperses these black energies. Question 278: I am reading the Handbook and was wondering your take of the words/titles the writer uses; god, highest of highs, creator. You don’t really go into this in your stuff. Answer: My material does not go into detailed commentary on The Handbook. I was originally put off by his use of those terms, BUT as you continue to get into the material, he switches those terms off. I believe he used them to reach to the lowest of the Advanced level, far lower than my material is geared for. Since you're asking about these words, you haven't gotten far enough into the trilogy. Hang in there, it gets much better. Question 279: First, so that you know where I stand...I KNOW (inherently) that all the information that you have presented in your writings are facts....very true and provable from so called \"spiritual\" and/or 3D perspective. Thank you for the information. Now, I would like some feedback. I know that the time for \"masters\", \"gurus\" and all of that is gone. I do realize that all the answers and power lie within myself, not external sources. I feel as you do, in that I enjoy the company of people spiraling out at the same rate as me and who are at a point in their life that is compatible with me. You are obviously there. Throughout my life, most of my \"astral\" experiences have been in the state between waking and sleep...usually late at night (between I2am-5am)....l see everything from glowing spheres of energy, to reptilians to \"ghosts\" and other human type figures appearing similar to a hologram. Lately this has sped up...I get these \"sightings\" even more and more often. It does not scare me...it intrigues me...and frustrates me that it seems that as I notice and begin to interact with other realms, I'm often pulled back into a \"waking\" state and become fully conscious but have a full recollection of what I just experienced. Is the frequency of these \"experiences\" increasing because we are nearing some type of \"apex\"...possibly the apex of \"NOW\" that is often spoken of by many aware authors? (By the way, I'm currently reading Monroe's \"Far Journeys\" ... I believe that is his second book...very good reading...although wordy (I prefer the simple, direct style in which you write) it gets the point across. Any insights or feedback would be greatly appreciated. 457"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Answer: Thanks for you comments! You seem to be doing quite well. Yes, the frequency of 'unusual' events IS increasing rapidly due to the rapidly approaching end. Continue to read. Monroe's trilogy will do you much good with tremendous information of the higher densities, primarily astral. Monroe chose NOT to give some details that I thought are necessary, hence I've made them known in M5. Also, be patient with yourself. All will come to you as you are ready. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 280: What about feeling as though you are neither male or female... you just are. You have not been drawn to homosexuality although appreciate the beauty in the bodies of both male and female. You have used the female body in the past - had lovers, had children, used the breasts to feed these children ...in fact, utilized the female vehicle with no waste. But then you feel neither. Or is it really an equal blend of the two(?) A way of being that does nothing for heterosexual relationships where the female/male games reside. Any comments? Answer: Very perceptive of you. Recognizing the gender problems is one thing, but MANY incarnations in both ARE required. They are what they are. Adjusting one's life to it is a goal. Observe the mess that genders have become due to alien genetic scientists and, in today's world, Dark/Light manipulatives. BUT don't get side-tracked with them. Watch them as if you were on a bus looking from the window. Take note, but don't get off! Question 281: Are Higher Selves responsible for positive remote viewing results? Maybe, I should ask, responsible for all psi activity? Or is there phenomena that's mainly about auric transceiving and the inter-connection of the ether/astral/'3d holograph and info? Answer: I am very unimpressed with 'remote viewing'. It's like something some people do who can't astral travel. ALL psychic activity is connected with the Higher Self and is part of being. Question 282: Have you ever perused the runes? If more than an alphabet they can be used as a tool ....... without all the deity-groveling. Each rune supposedly (more than just an intellectual presumption) taps/is tuned into a specific \"flow\" of creation, this system(s) is rather unique as it seems to have originated with peoples isolated from the System, (probably pretty watered down now though) Answer: Different predictive methods for different people. I've seen runes work, but have no desire/pull to deal with them. I prefer astrology (best) and tarot. I've been read by tarot readers but, with one minor exception, no one has been able to 'read' me. Drop the deity stuff you hear of (I hadn't heard that before but don't doubt you). Question 283: Minion spirits...what a thought! Well we all have chakras....what about a minion spirit who develops their higher chakras? Hope you don't say,\" they wouldn't desire to.\" Answer: The Nature Spirit group soul has a totally different Path to follow than ours. Earth's Planetary Spirit is pissed that minion spirits have to inhabit Earther bodies. As far as their Path goes, it's not our concern at this stage, so don't concern yourself about them. 458"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"Question 284: Remember I mentioned \"seeing\" an off white looking liz? would you know WHY I/anyone would have something like that pop into their hypnagogia? Feel funny here but ...... when I relieve myself and depending on what I'm fantasizing about (regular romantic copulating as to self indulgent un-natural pleasures). I keep seeing these guys in my hypnagogic field....when dwelling on the latter fantasies. I can't tell if it's all my past conditioning (praise god) and alternaive book reading, or I'm now (these visions started about 6 months ago) see them feeding on my energy or who knows what. Right before this I used to see all kinds of neat trails/phosphenes and geometries and again the tone would change depending on what I was fantasizing about. Very odd but I think this is pointing to some kinda big time truth. Answer: You MAY be picking up on 4th density reptilians. Question 285: So is Tantra not as cracked up as it is portrayed? Answer: I was asked to write (and did) the gay/lesbian supplement to a Tantra Yoga book that is now in 3 languages. First ever for a gay translation of Tantra that I've ever known. Tantra is for those who wish to use it. After writing that material, I can't see any reason for me to get involved with that.

Question 286: Is it possible from the material of Monroe to get to focus 27? Answer: You cannot purchase tapes to take you beyond focus level 12. Monroe did this on purpose and, even when I was there and requested certain higher tapes to be released, he said no. There are NO commercial tapes from them that will take you to higher levels (27 & 34/35) unless you’ve been to those weeks. I have audio tapes for these levels since I was there, but they would mean nothing to any listener who hasn't been there since no instructions are included 011 these tapes. I will say that the first time I took the journey to levels 34/35 (where the Higher Selves reside), it was a fantastic event that catapulted me over level 27 with a rush. It would make a great Disney ride attraction, I told them. Question 287: What is the \"energy Balloon\" that the tape talks about on Sync Wave \"Exploration Sleep\"? Answer: What Monroe calls an 'energy balloon' is actually a protective aura they have you place around yourself before the journey. Unfortunately Monroe wasn't into the psychic, so he is handicapped in this explanation. Question 288: what is the exercise to \"remember\" that the person is talking about in that exercise?

So, don't worry about what you can't get/do, just do what you can. If you are meant to get more, a way will open up for you. M A TR1X V: The Gold Edition Question 290: There is this Cassiopeian group and their contacts on the internet. I have read over their information, and it is very interesting, and a lot'of great truths there, but also pretty screwy and wrong. It conflicts directly with the Andromedan information on the number of levels of existence, and also directly about the nature of existence. Answer: What you run into, with any \"Follow Me\" scenario is truth heavily coated with outright lies. This is because Higher Self incarnates will be drawn to the truths BUT, unless they are Advanced enough, they will not be able to discern some or all of the lies and just presume it to be all truth. We've ALL been there and it's part of the learning process. Remember: ALL alien groups have their agendas. I will have more to say on this in the near future. Question 291: It really seems to be the product of a group of minds who have come into this \"non-duality\" mindset. It seems wrong to me. I'm not at the 5th right now, and I can't remember having been there, but still I can't think that this is the right way to view things, even if it is existentially possible (or common) to maintain this, I just don't like it. Answer: It's a pulse coming to you from YOUR Higher Self that results in your being uncomfortable with the many \"party lines\". As you continue to progress, your connection to your Higher Self will improve and strengthen. I recommend the easy meditation I gave in M5 for increasing your Higher Self connection. I've been using it for well over a year since developing it. Question 292: How common is it for us to feel this anger against \"5th dimensional non­ duality beings who are a little bored\"? Answer: You will eventually get to the best place for these feelings when you realize AND accept that this is ALL a Game. Once you move beyond majority body control, it will take on a whole new concept to you. As with above, I will be releasing more on this in the near future (in Second Edition of Matrix 5). You are where you are and that's OK. You WILL move beyond it, so keep reading and researching and become an observer. Question 293: I would assume that there are 5th density and upward beings who DO see the value of separating good and evil? Should we ask them for assistance, or what? Answer: NO! The only higher density being to ask assistance from is your Higher Self, the real you. This information is in M5. Question 294: If we did send destructive energy at 5th and upwards beings that had messed with us, would it really do anything? Answer: You would have NO effect on the Game. As Monroe said, when you try to work against the Game, it will notice you and deal with you. Is that what you want? You want to war against those who have set the Game. This is impossible with success. Don't worry 460"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"about the externals. Instead concentrate on your internal development and let the Game do it's own thing.

All Rights Reserved. Question 295: Ok, so I have been working on contacting my higher self, but have been unsuccessful as of yet, at least in that completely assured, jaw dropping way described by some(never been to the big jelly fish in sky, basically). I do meditation for an hour or so each day, and generally, I work on expanding my perceptive abilities and connective sensitivities. I believe that this is the first step towards a solid link to my higher self. I am aware of many 'forces' that try to impede me, due to my beginner status, and so occasionally have difficulty discerning what is really coming from the higher aspects of myself. Basically, I wanted to preface the major points I focus on, and see if anyone has any advice. There are three main things I work on: The first is to slow my brain waves down to theta or deep alpha (which is different than just relaxing the mind b/c you try and keep your conscious self aware, just refocused on deeper levels). This expands perception greatly. Second, I believe desire, will, intent, whatever you want to call it is important in calling the results you want into manifestation Third, I try without trying. Sort of like hitting the zone or pocket, just kind of letting things flow unimpeded. So far, I am seeing results, but not always as fast or effective as I would like. I am just thinking, does what I describe sound like I am putting up any blockages? OK, and lastly, does love have anything to do with contact between your higher self? I have heard from a number of sources, and believe to some extent, that love is one of those all pervading universal influences that allows growth and learning to take place,'and I am not talking about that all is love, thank you sir can I have another slap in the face, light-sider kind. Rather, I refer to the love that allows a deeper understanding of the world and wondrousness that surrounds oneself through a sort of universal empathy. I have heard that a person needs to have their heart chakra open to properly communicate with the higher aspects of themselves b/c that love is the medium through which it can truly take place. Now, I believe this to some extent, but you, The Author, have constantly warned against falling into the trap of the light-side, which I am desirous of avoiding. So do we do as Don Juan, and have affection w/out attachment? I believe so, but sometimes I get the impression from The Author that we should regard everything indifferently as experience and learning, apart from emotions, when I believe that feeling is an integral part of incarnation. Forgive my assumptions, and don't brand me as a halo happy love trumpeter, but I have to ask, you know? Answer: My comments on your 'love' dilemma is that you are trying to force yourself to find a single correct path based on others' experiences. Take what I say as guidance and not 'the only way'. Your incarnational level is not mine. Work at YOUR pace and don't compare what you are able to do or not do with what I have succeeded with. Your Higher Self has the Plan all set out for you. You can’t force yourself to be a Final or a Dominant if you aren't meant to be, and if you are one of those incarnations, you will Awaken when it is your time. THEN you can have the big AH-HA! So learn what you can at your pace and don't be concerned with the level of others. You probably won't get to, what you see as the 'indifferent' level (it's not, but, from where you're at, I’m sure it seems so), until you are a Final incarnation. You MAY become so in certain areas with different VERY Advanced incarnations, but it won't really hit you (and you'll embrace it) until you're a Final. Enjoy learning and your incarnation, but being OVER anxious can set its own blockages. 461"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved, Question 296: Do you have any prerequisites for teaching shamanism other than no female interference? Answer: TRUE shamanism is never able to be purchased. Also, if you are meant to learn, in any incarnation, a way will be opened to you AND, more importantly, the shaman will approach you after observing you. I have known 4 men who had the potential, but all 4 turned down becoming my students. Shows you where they're at and they have no idea what they declined. I found that, in all these 4 cases, their claiming to be heterosexual was a MAJOR block in their progressing. My invitations to them were to see if they were ready to advance. Now don't tiy and read anything into this other than what I said. I was approached by a shaman to study from her after I drove about 1000 miles alone to attend her seminar on Native American traditions. I had NO intention of anything but the seminar. I was surprised, but it was my time. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 297: I am reading Edgar Cayce’s book, \"On Channeling Your Higher Self'. He states that the way to ground information from the higher self (through intuition)is to act on it. The more we act on it the more we become open to receiving information. I am trying to combine this with the author's suggestion to focus on each chakra and say the words, Connect, See, Hear, Defend and Energize (Create). He also wrote that questions have their own vibrations and contain the seeds of their own answers. Any further suggestions? Answer: Acting on the information given by your Higher Self is veiy important, BUT you have to learn to discern what is from your Higher Self and what is from an external source mimicking your Higher Self. This comes through patience and practice. Once you get the unique feeling of a Higher Self communication, you can ignore, or at least take with a grain of salt, what is given to you by other astral means (wandering dead, 4th density aliens, etc). The pulse of energy from one's Higher Self is so unique and yet so subtle that nothing can equal it. Again, patience with yourself and your progress is urged. Question 298: In Monroe's Ultimate Journey, Monroe describe itself going to the future, 3025 or something like it, and find an advanced civilization on Earth, he also describe that some higher self will choose to have an incarnation HERE on this time and the last one on the FUTURE Earth, how this concept fits with the No-One here on 3000? Will ALL of our incarnations finish before 2012 or in the middle? Answer: Monroe does NOT go into the future and find another civilization on Earth. He finds a pristine Earth with NO civilization on it, but entities harvesting what he calls 'loosh'. He describes a few physical bodies on Earth that are stored for any of these beings who wish a temporary walk on this Earth. You are in error in several concepts and need to re-read that section of the book. Now HOW Earth goes from devastation, as is seen in 2200 BUT had happened MUCH earlier (2012?), has not been revealed and is not necessary to know at this time. IF you want to get this information for yourself, you'll have to visit the Library on 27 where you can get those answers. 462"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"Question 299: Over and over and from dozens of angles and perspectives, the Handbook for the New Paradigm (included as an appendix in M5) seems to point to the imperative for awakened individuals to do something quite specific to address the impending crisis connected with the intended move from covert to overt control on earth and in connection with the changes around 2012. Yet in the discussions I notice that nobody talks about this subject and when I hint at it in my posts, I get the response that there's nothing to be done about the fact that dark forces hold sway over the earth and that in fact that's the reason we came here — because of the unique challenge this presents and the unique opportunity for personal growth and development. Well I can certainly appreciate that, but is it the whole picture? On the other hand, the feeling I get reading the Handbook is that we came here to take an active role in determining a future direction for earth culture that would be other than a tyranny / victim polarity. Are we not talking about this agenda because of the suggestions in the Handbook regarding discretion, and working on a grass roots level in small cell-like groups? Generally, as you may gather, I'm confused about this point and would appreciate some further elucidation from those who understand. Thanks. Answer: You have confused the urge to learn and spiral out (which IS needed on an individual basis) with doing something against the controllers and upcoming crisis. There is NOTHING you can do in the last two groups. The ONLY valid action you can do is to do the best to learn all you can and assist in your spiral out of the Game. By removing yourself from the Game with your Final incarnation, you assist in what is in the near future. Likewise The Handbook does not tell you to actively move against the Game. Quite the opposite. It's a Lightsider approach you're reflecting that says, 'we have to save this or that'. You must move beyond the Lightsider approach and 'save' yourself. The rest will take care of themselves including the Earth Planetary Spirit who is ready to lower the boom as shim did with Atlantis. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 300: Alex Collier released an interview back in June 2001 which said a lot of curious things, and I wondered if you would comment on them. Here’s the first bit: According to the Andromedans, what we know as the Van Allen belt in a higher frequency is basically a place where the souls go to be reprocessed. Now lets me explain that first before I tell you what they said we should do. Yes there is a tunnel of light, and essentially the souls that are on the Earth are constantly being brought back.\" Answer: This relates to the tunnel of light some see at death. According to Matrix 2, the Markab aliens are responsible for this device with the generator located on an island off South Africa. For more details on that, I suggest you head to M2. The tunnel should be avoided by all who can as it is a trap. Question 301: Here's more: \"They're kind of being recycled. Now I realize that sounds a bit wacky, but the reality of it is; those souls that we know as ourselves are essentially being used to animate the body. It is the body that they are really interested in. But they themselves cannot animate the body. Only we can animate the body, you know the soul. So basically what they do is they shoot us back down into the bodies. It would be similar to bleaching, they erase our memories before we come in. And essentially I do not know the process on how they do that but that is how they compared it to, and that is bleaching. They basically hit us with so much of a low frequency, that it erases much of our genetic memory. The Andromedan perspective is that instead of going up into the hole, what we all should do is turn around and look behind us. Because according to them if we could do that we 463"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. would not be recycled and we could literally take ourselves out of the Earth's reincarnational cycle. And we could see the entire universe, and we could go anywhere we wanted to go. Now the soul can travel anywhere in an instant. Their impression is, is if we did that as souls, we would instinctively know exactly where to go because that's where we came from.\" Answer: These sound just like sequential incarnations speaking, because they do have their memories and know where to go after each incarnation. However this is also a red herring for Earther incarnations who are on a separate path. As. I've also said, the aliens mix truth with agenda when dealing with Earthers. I have been beyond our galaxy and have seen other planets and go anywhere I wanted and I'm still in the Earther cycle. It seems like they're trying to get Higher Selves to switch to the sequential path. That will never happen, even if they could convince a Low or a Mid-level incarnate, it's that Higher Selfs Final incarnation that holds all the cards. Question 302: The next bit: \"To add to that in their situation where the soul passes over and comes back, where the soul comes back and reincarnates back into their physical form, it's a matter of choice. Now they also have a choice not to reincarnates back into that society because they don't have the white tunnel. They can choose to leave, or they can choose to wait and come back, to choose a physical form. But they come back with their full memory. So lifetime after lifetime they are fully conscious of the lessons they learned in the lifetime before, and who they were in the lifetime before. Therefore that is what they call the Law of Consistency. Every lifetime the soul evolves, it never has to start all over. And this is why many societies and civilizations are far more evolved then we are. Technologically we are evolving quite rapidly but on a soul level we are stuck big-time.\" Answer: Sequential incarnational paths are what this is all about. Yes, THEY don't have the tunnel as it's not part of the Game that they play. Yeah, they call it the Law of Consistency BUT IT DOES NOT APPLY TO EARTHER HIGHER SELF INCARNATIONS! They outright LIE about us being stuck spiritually as they do NOT want to draw attention to simultaneous incarnations. We are technologically advanced because of ALIEN interference. They hope the technology will derail us from spiritual development. They also would like us to think they are SO Advanced. They are IF they are talking to one of our Low incarnations, but the reverse is true if they visit with a Dominant, VERY Advanced or Final incarnation. The Awakened Finals would set them straight, for sure. Question 303: I wonder if Collier is in crisis mode. He now tells people that it was the Nibiruans who joined the Andromedan Council last year (which he says the Andromedans themselves are very nervous about, since they don't trust the Nibiruans), and he's been telling us for a while that by 2003 \"the ET's\" will be given a mandate to leave the planet. Answer: The Nibiru are NOT to be trusted. They have a severe agenda. Now as to that 2003 deadline, the Andromedans said only a handful of systems have sided with them out of the whole council. It doesn't seem that they have the ability to force the issue if the Orion/Sirian Empires decide otherwise. The rest of the Council has agreed that Earth belongs to the Empires due to their genetic creations of Earther humans. For all this, time will tell, which is why I keep saying work on your inner self and let the Game take care of itself!

Does this mean that any incarnation has the potential to awaken as a final, dominant, or advanced? Or is it more like Monroe's experience of sequential incarnations, but from a higher perspective, all of them happening simultaneously? Answer: NO, your Final incarnation is determined only by your Higher Selfs Dominant incarnations. Obviously a low or mid-level incarnation can't become a Final. When your Final incarnation Awakens after the Dominants decide what is needed in a Final, shim will have full access to this information FOR YOU. Don't be overly concerned with the Final. If it is your current incarnation, you will know it. If you are a Dominant or Very Advanced, just keep learning and doing. ALL your incarnations are YOU, after all.

Can you tell some more about those who are part of the Darkside? Answer: As is the nature of the Dark polarity, they are not easily seen. They hide in the shadows, for the most part, or would like people to believe they are Lightsiders. The wolf in sheep's clothing example fits. While Lightsiders are busy blessing each other and trying to 'save' (read instead force conformity) on others, Darksiders primarily look for ways to increase their power. I can guarantee you that at any large gathering of New Agers or psychics, Darksiders WILL be present. I went to a seminar in West Virginia a few years back and there was a group of Dark female witches there trying to drain people of their energies at whatever chance they got. I had to work overtime in undoing their manipulations to the group and in clearing friends. I called them the Daughters of Darkness. Another area of Dark activity, as told to me by my shaman teacher, is Native American pow-wows. Dark shamans attend these events and look to steal personal energies. A savvy Darksider shaman can latch on to your energy with little effort and quite quickly. They gather others' energies for their own purposes. Only another shaman can undo the damage of a Dark shaman. You will not hear many of that polarity announce that they are Darksiders. If they do, it alerts those who aren't and this greatly inhibits their work. No, if anything, they’ll take up the blessing of each other and say 'love & light' to disarm their victims. Darksiders are predatory and sadistic with intent. Keep your gold shield up and be aware when you attend group conventions or seminars. Don't be paranoid, but DO be alert. Question 314: Over and over and from dozens of angles and perspectives, the Handbook for the New Paradigm (included as an appendix in M5) seems to point to the imperative for awakened individuals to do something quite specific to address the impending crisis connected with the intended move from covert to overt control on earth and in connection with the changes around 2012.

Question 315: \"I’m curious about you're understanding of Baal as it relates to your post on ownership? Do you believe in ownership here on earth or elsewhere?\" Answer: Baal is LONG gone and of 110 interest to me today.' The biggest form of ownership on Earth today seems to be people who believe they 'own' others. People living together, under one form or another, refuse to allow the other to have free association with someone not in the partnership. He/she's MINE and they can't do that attitude. Being an Aquarius, I find that MOST disgusting. That's why I'm anti-marriage of ALL sorts. Living together with someone is fine, but 'fuck the marriage'. That began under Orion rule to control the newly created Earther humans. As to property ownership, you read my Illusion Buster thing. There is temporary ownership of individual articles. Example, no one can just walk into your home and take what they want. The Native American idea of 'you can't own the Earth' is correct, but the Game players believe THEY own the Earth (Dark siders) and everything on it. Understanding temporary ownership to the fullest also means you know they are conveniences of the moment and part of your experiences. You keep the experiences forever. You can also re-create any object from the 3rd density on the 4th, if you wish. This should answer your question. Question 316: \"I agree on the \"illusion\" of home ownership. However, what is the best way to remedy this situation in your opinion? In other words, how do we obtain what is really ours if possible?\" Answer: What is really 'yours' is spiritual and experiences. It's nice to have 'things', but what if you lost them all tomorrow? I've seen the weeping/wailing over tornado destroyed homes on TV. The low through mid-Advanced levels will all carry on over lost 'things' because they haven't realized that 'things' don't really count. The Game wants us to believe we are our physical, hence consume, diet, exercise, etc. NONE of this stuff will extend your incarnational existence since, before you incarnated, you chose the date and manner of death. As I say in M5, this is why George Burns was able to smoke/drink until almost 100 BUT the guy who 'invented' jogging died while jogging and died 'young'. Everything we temporarily possess is not really 'ours'. What is yours and you need to reclaim are lost soul pieces, for example. Now THAT you need as part of reclaiming your power. You can't fight the Game. You can learn to manipulate yourself around it and spiral out, thus winning the Game. 468"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"Question 317: \"Don't 4th Density Reptilians resonate with the DNA of a 3rd Density human via rituals to possess them, and shapeshift into the physical 3D reality? They go thru all these nasty Masonic and Satanic rituals that call up these entities... I always thought that there were both 4D (invisible to our eyes) and 3D Reptilians. Answer: It's one thing to possess someone, and that happens a lot with those creeps, BUT it's a whole other thing to be here on the 3rd density as a reptilian and try to hold the human form. If it were simple possession, they would have NO need to 'hold the human form* as that is the body they possess. David says they need to keep people from seeing their true reptilian form. That's because they have a reptilian 3rd density body. The blood allows them to keep from reverting to reptilian unwillingly. Question 318: \"Maybe they have the need to expand their power base from 4th Density into 3rd Density?\" Answer: That's neither here nor then in relation to what I talked about. There are plenty of reptilians in the 3rd density and on Earth already. It IS a partnership, but one needs physical stuff and the other needs astral. Question 319: \"You inicated that the black race was apparently created to be slaves for the Orion empire. However when I search the history books the earliest civilizations were said to be founded by blacks (Egypt, Sumer and the Indus Valley). Blacks weren't always slaves, but in fact enjoyed a high status throughout the world. Isn't it likely that the Orion empire used blacks to their own ends, then dumped them in favor of whites after a period of time? Also, is Vodou (voodoo) a higher self oriented spiritual philosophy? What about other African spiritual teachings? I realize that WE ARE NOT OUR BODIES. However I think that having some of these questions answered will give me greater insight in certain areas so I can spiral out of the game, thank you very much, (posted Aug 25,2001) Answer: Actually black Africans did NOT found Egypt. This is a myth among some blacks. Blacks were referred to as Nubians by the Egyptians and were portrayed with black colors on skin on the walls, while the Egyptians had either white or Arabic brown. I've heard some blacks say Cleopatra was black. She was Greek. The Sumerians weren't black either. BUT, even here this is MUCH later than the creation of the race. The aliens created the blacks for manual labor and related dexterity. This is why that group does so well in athletics. It's part of their composition as a race. Whites were created for other purposes, as were Orientals, etc. I suggest you read Morningsky's 'LA Transcript’ where he goes into much detail on the creation of races (from an Orion propaganda point of view) or access all the data you can handle on this in the Library on 27. Much of the 'history' you are reading is rewritten by people trying to change what was to what sounds better. Blacks never 'enjoyed a high status throughout the world'. Unfortunately the gifts they had to contribute were not appreciated by most. Same goes for Native Americans, Aborigines and Pacific Islanders. These peoples were subdued by conquest oriented races (white and yellow). Voodoo is NOT Higher Self oriented. It is very lower astral oriented. The blood oriented rites that are includes in some of the practices show the reptilian connection. Voodoo has their deities like Changa and others who are basic Monroe level 25 events. No better or worse than any other pantheon. As far as other teachings, you'd probably enjoy Credo Mutwa's Zulu materials. I have his 2 video tapes offered by David Icke on Icke's site (www.davidicke.com). Each race has interesting teachings. It's up to you to sort through them and adapt what fits you and discard what doesn't. Thereby you come up with a unique mixture that is YOURS.

Is it just the variety of experiences that allows us to feel such rich emotions while in an Earther body? Is there any other way for a higher self to gain the same emotional knowledge? Answer: It’s not that the Second Edition material was \"not included\" in the First Edition. It didn't exist when the First Edition was released. The Second Edition stuff I released AFTER the First Edition was released. The answer to your questions is Yes to the first and a strong NO to the second. Question 321: \"I'm now at page 105 in M5 and am feeling more and more despised by women - their control - and especially their 'dark looking' eyes. It’s like I'm able to see right trough them and know what they're all about. Being a het man for about 80% a week ago this is changing rapidly. There is a sort of domino game started and the bricks have started dropping. My feelings for women are dropping really fast (and my girlfriend is noticing this like nothing before). I feel an emerging need to retract myself from society and study as much as I can / get into the astral to connect to my Higher Self - as quickly as possible. It's hard being faced with 3d although I am also getting a BIG increase in emotional control. Never could I have imagined things to change so drastically - but I just know it's the right thing and it feels totally ok to do.

The Game won't let you go quietly, however, so stay strong! Question 322: \"Another point which is important for me is to know about Atlantis - its state of knowledge and the reason for the fall. Applying the above mentioned method to understand what happened gave me until now only glimpses.

I had only a few sessions and applied this technique then alone. It is done by a \"countdown\", getting quiet and sinking deep down into oneself. The therapist called it alpha-status.

That this has happened to you indicates you are likely a Dominant or the Final incarnation. Only you will be able to determine this. Be patient with yourself and see what happens next. Question 324: \"I've been aware of a certain \"Glitch\" in this illusion. I have not gone out and formally gathered data on this matter, so this comes from my general observations. If you think back to your neighborhood that you grew up in, you may remember the cars, neighborhoods, businesses/buildings/houses, etc. that existed when you were a child. You may remember a smaller population in that particular area back then. Most likely, if you go back to that town you will see MORE businesses, more cars, more buildings/houses/streets and A LOT more people. The reason you will see more people is because the population rate has exploded (DNA breeding commands at work). Now I'll discuss the glitch in the illusion of this 3d \"reality\". With everything that has changed, there are also A LOT of people who have died. The majority of people who die (especially in this country) are not cremated, they are buried at a cemetery. With all the infrastructure and population growth in the various towns, cities and states of this country since the beginning of the 1900's, the amount of DEAD people should have increased dramatically too. Now, WHERE are the bodies going? WHY HAVE the sizes of graveyards NOT expanded over the years? I have seen one or two graveyards in my life that were being expanded but it's the overall RATE of expansion that does not \"CLICK\" in my mind. It does not fit. I've always perceived this fact as a glitch in the \"program\". It's the same way a computer program has certain parameters and the program may work flawlessly, except for a very minor glitch that is only perceived by the most aware programmer. We exist in \"bodies\" in a type of program called \"the human experience\" and this program has parameters (rules of the game). Is it possible that the game could have a glitch in the program? Just something to think on. Answer: Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I had very briefly let this pass through my mind about a week ago but didn't follow up. I like what you've written and I do agree with you. The only areas I know where the dead are buried on top of each other is in Louisiana, primarily the New Orleans area due to the super high water table, BUT, even that does not explain where all the dead have gone. I know in my area there are only a few graveyards and none of them all that big. My father died in 78. In all those years not all that much more of that catholic cemetary has filled up. Actually very few people (percentage wise) are cremated as most are low to mid-Advanced levels who are body ID'd and grieve for the loss of the physical so they hang around cemetaries of their dead. ALL the points you brought up are very valid. I will see what else comes to me in my ’travels' about this. Many thanks!

Question 325: \"I had a dream that left me perplexed, and I wanted to share with you for any suggestion, this I think, has to do with the some of my incarnations. I was in a very big oval hall, like a room, but it was not glow inside, it had seats, like in a theater, what brings 471"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"this dream to my attention was that there was FULL of people, now, what seems interesting about this dream is that I take seat and just observed, it seems like a congregation of people, they are like 'singing' but I didn't understand what are they talking' or 'singing' cheerfully, It was called my attention to one girl, it was Russian in appearance, although I felt VERY pleased to been there, I felt a PEACE INSIDE and ALL around me, like never before, I just sit down close to one of the seats and just closed my eyes and listen, although I didn't understand anything I didn't care so much. After that I didn't remember how we get out of this and are walking, I follow this Russian girl and try and talk to her, but she didn't understand me at all, no matter what language I tried to speak to her, she knew me, but smiling she let me know that she didn't understand me and I shouldn’t try to for now. So she left, and I fell some kind of LOST, I did find the way home, right after I woke up, with a feeling of 'loneliness', I can figure it out what this dream may be, for me, but my question will be 'can the higher self disguise in any kind of 'credible' suit' for me to understand? Answer: Only you can figure out what YOUR Higher Self does and why. I will say the Higher Self will give messages based on the level of development your incarnation is. Further Response from Questioner in Response to Answer: \" Exactly as I 'felt' it, your answer is the 'confirmation' that I needed, I know I'm not seeing things from a very advanced position right now, so it seems that I need 'approval' from external, although I don't need your approval nor approval from anyone, either way I thank you anyway for taking your time, as may seem from YOUR point of view as useless, to give the same advice on and on to people that is NOT at your level, from my view, YOUR points are MORE than important to me, keep your excellent work, we 'the un-awakened ones' truly thank you for that, My time has not come yet, but it WILL, in THIS incarnation and I know that, no matter what you think you’re doing, you're helping, you're giving a 'hand' to those that still needs some 'kicks in the butt' to remember, your attitude is more than appropriate to me, your 'GO FIND YOURSELF, DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE’ attitude really PUSH me to my limits and deserves mention, I will follow your work, very closely, my higher self is REALLY coming through me, and I know that, so, I’m grateful for that, TO ME, TO MY Higher self and TO YOU. ” MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Question 326: \"It seems a little ’coincidental' that within a week after Nicholas Soltys was caught for a mass family murder in California that we have another case in Iowa of a search for a man who killed a bunch of people, and an APB is out for him. Stuff to keep the public mind occupied? Are these two people mind-controlled sleepers that have been activated? One cop in Iowa said that over his 35 year career, he has seen a lot of murders, \"but nothing like this\". This kind of trend (mass murder of family members) does NOT normally appear randomly, but can appear as a ’copycat’ some times. Actually, if you consider the woman who drowned all five of her children, which occurred before the Soltys event, there are THREE cases, all within a short time.\" Answer: The Game is counting on the majority to be ’horrified’ over these things and pay no attention elsewhere. Same with that Conduit case. Last night's news says 'people are living in fear' that these murderers are looking for them. These 'people', primarily minions, are so manipulated and feed astral Dark beings with their fears. Well, September starts tomorrow and it COULD contain a major event. Time will tell.

I have been doing energy work with a very talented healer and we have uncovered what appears to be an alien incarnation. So the question is: How does this fit into the scheme of things? Is is possible for a Higher Self experiencing simultaneous human incarnations to slip in an alien incarnation for kicks and still have it a simultaneous incarnations? Answer: You can have alien incarnations before accepting the Earther challenge. Once the challenge is accepted, your alien sequential incarnations would, of course, be over and Earther simultaneous ones begin. Needless to say, the alien incarnations are still part of you, but they are a part that is over even though the memories are contained in one’s Higher Self. No to your second question. Question 328: I do find it interesting that you can have alien sequential incarnations before accepting the Earther challenge. I've had strong feelings for a while that I have not only genetic connections to my former teacher (due to the insertion of certain reptilian DNA during the whole gender splitting/genetic manipulation of Earthers), but there always seemed to be some distant \"memory\" of some sort, which connected me to him in some previous experience. I've had certain experiences with my former teacher in which I had a VERY distinct feeling that I had been there with him before and he did say that I had indeed completed certain experiences with him before in a previous existence. NOW i truly understand why I have felt so connected to this man for so long. I mean, yes the information he presented appealed to me, and I was sure there was also some genetic magnetism, however you have added even more clarity to my understanding of that experience with your statements. Well, now the voice of my higher self in this Earther incarnation is coming through and I know that I am on a path on the \"rocky road\" and I've seen through the control paradigm that I was a part of for so long. Answer: With those who have had alien incarnations before starting the Earther path, they can have current alien incarnates (living on Earth) who would like to drag them back to the past (remember the point of the Game). Since you can't abort simultaneous incarnations, they do try and derail/delay your progress by throwing red herrings, alien spirituality and so on to attempt to confuse the incarnation from fulfilling shim's purpose. BUT the Higher Self didn't just fall off the turnip truck, you see, even if the incarnation did. The Higher Self will intervene in any situation where the incarnation cannot handle on his/her own or where it will permanently keep the incarnation from fulfilling the destiny/experiences required by the Higher Self. It's a Game and it has a complicated set of rules that can make the rules of that popular role-playing game, Dungeons & Dragons, bow in awe. Question 329: \"Concerning homosexuality. A higher self would desire to incarnate in a \"gay\" body simply for the sake of not getting involved with Orion DNA issues, yes? It really doesn't have anything to do with body identification, true? Thanks for your time.\" Answer: There are different reasons for choosing gay/lesbian incarnations. First is purely for the experience. ALL Higher Selves NEED these experiences to appreciate the First Law of the Universe. But, like I say in M5, if the incarnating spirit is not mature enough, the 473"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"body will rule and they can be real floozies. With an Advanced spirit, the choice is so that advancement is not interfered with by Orion DNA shorts that occur when males/females interact in living or intimate ways. My physical is not queenish, and I'm not taken for gay when people meet me. However, being free of the opposite gender, yet in a male/creative body, my Final Incarnation has the optimum advantages.

Question 330: \" I have an interesting observation, for which I'm proud of everyone on the list who has participated has not done: They have never asked you who you really are. Maybe I missed it on the Smartgroups, but the question has never been raised. That, at least, should be considered a positive action. Hopefully, they realized this is a physical/body ID situation where it's part of the GAME and unimportant. That is, what is primarily important is that you are a final incarnation being willing to share with us and our Higher Selves your observations about the GAME itself, plus our willingness to view those observations incarnated all the way to the top echelons of our Higher Selves. Personally, and honestly, I don't want to know who you are, whether you are male or female, rich or poor, etc. It simply doesn't matter to me. In fact, I have a feeling you have purposely chosen the name, \"The Author\" to keep the focus off of you and on to the work you and Val have published. This is a very smart move for which I support. It has taken me a little bit to put it together, but that's the fun part; self discovery of situation around oneself. Also, I have purchased the First Wave of the Gateway series from the Monroe Institute. I'm looking forward to progressing further and enter the Library for all the information I can muster. Ironically, I lived at the Library since first grade and felt quite at home. I'm sure it was my Higher Self remembering where I had been at the upper levels.” Answer: Remember that un-named Lightsider site I've brought up on the Group site? ALL they were concerned about is WHO I am and not what M5 is, not that I ever participated on their site. Val tried, but got rapidly bounced off for not towing the Lightsider path. I'm glad that hasn't come up yet, but I want to attract the VERY Advanced, Dominants and any Finals out there to the site. WHO I am is not significant to them because they are into higher matters rather than the physical ID. This is why I chose to use The Author, not that I would be known if I used my real name, which as it is not one of consequence (on the scale of M5 or other spiraling out materials). This way I also keep my privacy and limit who has access, and to what degree, with me. Even when I gave the 2 M5 lectures in early May, I was asked if I would go to their local groups and speak to them. I said yes, but never heard from them. I guess not being a 'known' name is to my advantage and their loss and THAT is part of my plan. I will tell you that I am male but FAR from being rich (neither is Val). Only George Green (publisher of the Handbook trilogy) is rich, that I know of. I hope the tapes work well for you. Enjoy discovering who YOU are! Question 331: \"You mentioned that minions have flat eyes, (windows to the soul?) and minimal spiritual interests. Still I'm not sure what distinguishes them from very low incarnations, perhaps you can clarify this. I have had these questions for a while, and would be very appreciative if you could provide me with some more insight, thank you very much. Answer: I can give you no clarification of this and have said all I will, in public, on this topic.

MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 332: \"There's a guy by the name of David Hudson, who has discovered the monoatomic gold (also referred to as the White Powder of Gold) used by priests centuries ago. It's supposed to be a substance that when ingested, will give the applicant access to higher densities. David leke mentions it in The Biggest Secret. I don't know how familiar you are with it, but do you think it can be helpful to the spirits progression on earth, or should an incarnation let everything take its course? I understand that we should look within and not depend on external substances, but I’ve been very curious about this since reading one of Hudson's articles. Just wanted to get your thoughts. Answer: There is such a substance, but there are also false versions of it. The one of the main reason China invade Tibet was because it is the major source of that material. I've never used it, so can't comment on how good it is/isn't. If you are supposed to use it, your Higher Self will kick in to see you do. My shamanic teachers taught that the only valid way to develop spiritually is to do it without ANY substances as they are all artificial. Question 333: On reading MV I have been through an amalgam of emotions, to read this information is so thought provoking that for me if I am not reading it at every opportunity then I am thinking about it. Being a female I will admit at first I was shocked, horrified and ashamed to be a female, how right the author is about the profile, then I realized that being a female was the experience I had chosen. I have never read anything like this in my life, in the many years since I started on this road of finding the - who, why, what and where of life, now feel like the engineer in the film 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' after he saw the UFO he became obsessed with the mountain and had to get there, my mountain is gaining access to my higher self. What the author talks about in MV just makes so much sense, no matter what situations we find ourselves in, it’s all about the experience. Now to find out amongst other things our DNA has been tampered with, that religions, governments and all of it are to keep tight control of the slaves. Where have I been all my life? - up until now I have lived here on this earth, I see and I'm blind, I hear and I'm deaf to all that has been happening around me. I have no idea where I am situated regarding my higher self, what I do know is because of what the author has imparted, I am armed with the most powerful of all tools and that power is KNOWLEDGE! I also realize that having the information is wasted unless it is followed by actions that further one towards one's higher self! I feel as though I have been awakened and freed from the lie I have been living, I know my higher self is aware of this. Now my journey is beginning.\" Answer: Thank you for your wonderful comments! There is NO reason for anyone to be ashamed being either gender. You are doing what YOUR Higher Self needs for experience. That you recognize these Orion DNA flaws shows how far your spirit has become and is much to your credit. A Very Advanced incarnation can overcome most of the DNA flaws the aliens instilled. That you got a copy of M5 and are reading it says (to you) that there is material in M5 that you/your Higher Self need now. Keep reading/keep researching. There is NO other book like M5 on Earth today. Adapt the knowledge to fit your Path.

Question 334: During the last two days, and as each hour passes, I have been feeling literally physically nauseous. NOT of what is happening, but WHY it's happening, the minions to midlevel advanced won't wake the FUCK UP! Every time I observe something, I feel my intelligence and spiritual maturity insulted. Yes, I am learning from the experience, but how can such incarnates be so fucking stupid!!! (that was a rhetorical question, Author). This GAME is thick with Plots, Sub-Plots, Assorted Characters of every species, Ego driven Personalities, and a huge drama display. Hell, forget going to the Opera or reading Shakespeare, we're observing the THE MOVIE OF THE CENTURY. My apologies on the sarcasm, but it behooves me to know what I know, and others do not because of the lack of spiritual maturity. I, personally, have come a very long way since I was a mere child to where I am now. Surely, those who are succumbing to the physical/body id scenario can go past it. Oh, and if that's not enough, the \"Love and Light\" crowd (of a Eagle and CTRL lists I subscribe to) gave me a headache. I literally had to back off and take some Tylenol. HOW IN THE LIVING HELL ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FORGIVE, AND ACCEPT SHIT FROM GOD, ETC WHEN THEY DON'T FUCKING EXIST AND IT'S ALL A GAME?!??!?! Time to workout some stress. Answer: That you are allowing yourself to experience stress shows what experiences you need, BUT that you are experiencing stress says something too. Awakened Finals will not be stressing as their view is totally different. The Event is trying to draw everyone in as a participant to some degree or another. If you allow yourself to be so drawn in, you lose more and more of your observer position and become a participant. That isn’t bad, but it will also reveal you (the general 'you') not to be as Advanced as you might think yourself to be. Yes, the Game IS full of sub-plots, etc. You probably have no idea just how many and how deep. Some people would rather play ostrich and say these Events don't matter and hide their heads in the ground. This is their way of expressing internal fears. Events MUST be confronted as tests (to yourself) of where you are in your progression. If you get sucked into the Event OR you want to ignore the Event, you still have much work to do. None of that is either good or bad, but where you are and what you still have to work through. Treat yourself to a full body massage. Break away from observing the Event by doing something totally different (watch a comedy movie). If your response is \"but the Event...\", then you are being controlled by the Event. I get tired of the same old shit over and over and will play a computer game, turn on the New Age music channel and I'm getting a massage on Saturday. My life proceeds and is not ruled by the Event BUT I am able to observe MANY facets of it, not all of which I put on this group site. M A TR IX V: The Gold Edition Question 335: Having read MV and now re-reading it, although it all feels 'right' within, I feel as though I am in a children's nursery class when it comes to ME speaking about it to the Author or Val, because I feel I can't do justice to what I would like to properly say. As I said I am reading MV, the posts on a daily basis, and I am also reading all the previous ones since July. Like everyone else, every day you do what you have to do to live etc. I don't know about anyone else, but on discovering the information it is like an obsession which has become interwoven into my psyche. I can't believe how quickly this has happened because by nature I am a cautious person. But I could never go back to how I perceived life before MV. I hope that I have got this right. My Higher Self requires experiences of life. Living however 476"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. many lives and experiences it takes to return the knowledge to my Higher Self. But prior to each incarnation I have asked for a particular challenge and experience of that life be it good, bad, or whatever. Also all incarnations are living at the same time be they low, advanced, very advanced, dominant or final, these all have concurrent incarnations, they all have their own unique experience. When the individual incarnation experience is over then that knowledge is absorbed by my Higher Self. Unfortunately on third density the aliens have manipulated our DNA so instead of us 'being one' we have become male and female to reproduce more slaves, also most of us are unaware that we are being totally manipulated whichever way we turn by religion and government who themselves are mere puppets of the aliens. We are kept body-focused to look outwardly through our appearances and all that this entails. Even when we leave this life on earth, they are waiting in the next density to deceive us. The only way for us to free ourselves is to change our mind-set to realize it's all about the experience, as the Author says, to see the game for what it really is. Observe but take no part in light or dark polarities, take no part in the victim/victimizer mentality. Realize that it makes no difference if we are low or dominant incarnations as they all have their part to play. We are here through our experiences to learn wisdom, gain knowledge, and amongst other things understanding the me within my Higher Self. Have Iona very basic level got some of it? Answer: You are doing VERY well with your progress. Remember that ALL incarnations/Higher Selves progress at different rates with different experiences. Work at YOUR pace with guidance from YOUR Higher Self, the only true source for YOU. The aliens with their tunnel light trap don't try and get everyone, but they do seem to go for certain ones and I can't say who they are. They DO NOT go after minion spirits. This is just another alien attempt at interference with Higher Self Earther incarnations. With observing, it's not 'take no part in the polarities’, it’s not to get caught up in the Game's drama and risk falling back into it. If you are attacked, for example, you should defend yourself. Don't be overly concerned with this as it becomes apparent as you progress. You'll learn to always observe and when to dabble in events (example, you still have to go to work, eat, pay rent, etc). Good comments. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 336: In December 1977 ,1 was going through a really black period and basically just wanted to exit this life. So I used to go for walks around one or two in the morning, which I found therapeutic (in those days it was relatively safe) As I was walking, I heard a voice. Thinking someone was behind me I turned around but there was no one there. The voice told me to look in a magazine that I had in the house. On returning home I looked everywhere but couldn't find the magazine then realized that I had thrown it in the bin the previous day. So there I was at two thirty in the morning rummaging through the bin - ugh! On finding the magazine I searched from back to front and then back again not knowing what I was looking for. Then I saw an advertisement for a book, Where I live in Scotland back in 1977, books of an esoteric nature etc., were difficult to obtain and could only to be found in large bookshops or to order from abroad. I ordered and received the book which had been translated into English. Ironically the book is called 'The Corner Stone' which is basically about Spirituality and life after death, and it explains that there is no death, (so what was I thinking!) in essence it is a 'light-sider book. But this knowledge changed 477"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"everything for me; in this incarnation this was my first step along the road of personal enlightenment. For twenty-four years I have often wondered where that voice came from. On reading Matrix V I now finally realize that it was my Higher Self speaking and fortunately my ears were open. I read in one of the posts that 'someone' was surprised that 'no-one' had asked who the author is, is he rich etc. To me the information that he is giving is coming from the 'CONSCIOUSNESS of WHO HE REALLY IS', to the 'CONSCIOUSNESS of WHO WE ARE’ in this incarnation. That's all that matters anything else regarding his personal life is irrelevant! I feel looking around me that there has- been a change of consciousness since the seventies. If I hadn't read all the books prior to reading Matrix V then I believe that I would not have understood or appreciated it. The author is right; the only way to find out the truth is by going through the experience not just having the belief. Now after twenty-four years I have started to astral project. It has taken a long time to learn to do this, as the biggest block to this is fear of the unknown. In this world you can smile while you dislike someone to hide it, but in the astral, as you really are - so it is! Regarding the years 2012 to 3000, a few people have asked the author what he thinks will happen because he has been to focus 27,1 think to be able to get to this level and access the library one has to be so advanced within the consciousness with wisdom and maturity, that comes from the evolved self within this incarnation, so it is for each and every one of us to find the library for ourselves which is where 'we' will find the answers, and if it is not to be in this incarnation then it will be in another. Obviously everything is going to change on this planet. I think we all feel that, but there are so many variables it depends what wild cards are played and by whom. We could blow ourselves up tomorrow. The aliens could make themselves known to us, it's anybody's guess, but one thing is certain, we are all going to find out - when it happens! Answer: Some EXCELLENT perceptions/observations here. Great work. Focusing on WHO I am is a distraction to what is in M5 and beyond in this group site. The questions about my physical IS a Game twist - the 'you are your body' mode, which is not true in the Very Advanced stages and above. The physical can be used by this type of spirit to move disguised (I don't mean alien shape-shifter, but spiritually disguised). When an alien group saw me physically, they thought I was just like anyone else. When they used a device to probe into my true self, they found out otherwise. What I say and how I say it, many times, is to shake the tree and drive the Light-siders away. I have many 'tests' of my own to see just how sincere someone is when approaching me, but enough of that. You will ALL reach a point (probably during your Awakened Final) when you DON'T want a lot of attention. That’s why I don’t see other Awakened Finals revealing materials similar to mine, but then, that was a big part of my purpose. Meanwhile be happy with who you are. Where I was 20 yrs ago is light night and day to where I am today. It will happen in YOUR Final Incarnation as well...ALL of you.

Question 337: “The inability to change the momentum toward enslavement is the deception that is being pushed upon human awareness by every means possible. It is imperative that it is realized that self-aware consciousness is not powerless when it understands how the Universal Laws operate.” (trufax welcome page per Handbook) Matrix 5 suggests that we cannot stop the enslavement, that it is a done deal. The Handbook seems to suggest that a critical mass could take place as a result of intention and active 478"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"observation. My cut is that we raise our individual consciousness, and as an inadvertent result, mass enslavement may be delayed. Please advise ... Answer: What no one can change is the rule book of the Game. What you CAN change is your participation IN the Game and spiral out of it. IF all we had on Earth were Higher Self incarnations, THEN they could join to repulse any alien group. However since the majority of Earth inhabitants are minion (Nature Spirit group soul) incarnations, that cannot happen. The Earth planetary spirit is NOT at all happy with the use of the Group souls, but it is allowed under the Game. As long as you think in the physical salvation mode, you haven't advanced enough to realize there is NO salvation in the physical for the physical. It’s only a vehicle for experiences. The desire to drive away the Orion/Sirian Empires, Niburu or anyone else with an agenda (all sequential incarnates trying to beat the simultaneous incarnates) is BODY orientation/survival instinct. There are alien groups who say if the majority of Earthers band together, they will intervene. When many Higher Selves tried this, they did NOT intervene. They KNEW they wouldn't but they were testing to see if they could locate advanced enough Higher Selves. For what purpose? I'm not quite sure. This is why in M5, I advise the reader to concern themselves with spiraling OUT of the Game because you cannot defeat it in any other way, BUT by defeating it, you win. If you cannot understand this, you will as you advance. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 338: One thing I have learned after reading Matrix V is not to resent the game. You can't resent it, or the people playing it, because to me at least, that is a form of victim- hood. By whining about how you are subject to heartless manipulation constantly (which I have done plenty of), you make yourself a victim, and rob yourself of the perspective you need to pull yourself out of that mentality, and hence reclaim your power. I don't think you should resent any of the incarnations for where they are at, be it minion or low. Even they can hold jewels of wisdom for you (which they most likely won't even realize), if you haven’t closed your ears to what they have say. How can one possibly resent the experience they chose to have, and expect to progress beyond it? Now, don’t get me wrong, I certainly don't think you have to make yourself available to all the mentality and perspective pushed on you by lower, and polarity based sources. However, I do think it is important to exercise allowance, and invoke your understanding of why they are where they are at, instead of simply stating idiocy as a cause. I have been shown that no matter how bad I want to leave all this human stuff behind, I am still here, and while I am, I NEED to pay attention to it and to analyze its significance. For people who are closer to spiraling out, don't resent those below, because you've got to have the understanding of the dynamics of the game to beat it.\" Answer: Once learning about the Game, low-mid level Advanced WILL resent the Game because they can't understand the mechanics of it. You are lecturing to a different class of advancing spirits who are where they are. Lecturing them with \"you can't\" rather than \"you shouldn't\" sounds like a control maven. The Law of Allowance says you allow them to proceed at their pace and where they are. 'Saving' others is a low-mid level Advanced thing and not of the Very Advanced. The resentment of incarnational levels is ALWAYS of lower to advanced. No one ever resents not being of a lower level, so you have that wrong. You most certainly CAN resent their constant interfering in your stuff, however. This is a vast difference from \"resenting where they are\". You are still a bit Light-sider tinged in your opinions. You will shed these as you progress. You don't yet have a grasp of the perspective of levels higher than yourself. It will come in time. 479"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 339: First of all I want to say that since I have come across your material a lot of changes have occurred in my life. My wife has left me, my father is dying of cancer and I am being laid off from my job. Well this all sounds so tragic but I firmly believe that this is part of a higher purpose. I do not believe in coincidence and when I first read your material on the Leading Edge website, I felt a surge of energy run through me and I absolutely am convinced that you have unlocked a door that was unavailable to me before. Being born in the sign of Cancer, I tend to form external emotional attachments to people, places and things. Now that I am \"losing\" everything, I am beginning to understand that part of my personal journey on this planet is to understand that clinging to the external is only a trap to make me forget what is really important. I am trying to form an internal relationship with my Higher Self but I have to admit I still have a lot of work to do. I have ordered the Matrix 5 book, so I know without a doubt everything is going to work out the way it should. Thank you for your valuable information and help to all of us who are trying to spiral out of this illusion. Well, anyway, on to my question. I have read the Monroe books many times over. I felt drawn to his work, much like I was drawn to your work. In \"Far Journeys \", Monroe speaks of the harvesting of \"loosh\" for some unknown purpose. Monroe seemed to have a rather positive perspective on this in his book but I am beginning to wonder if perhaps he wasn't seeing the whole picture. It seems to me that this harvesting is being done by the very forces who seek to enslave us. You mentioned before that Monroe didn't always speak about what he knew. I have often found what seemed to me to be contradictions in his information. Why would he mention this harvesting of \"loosh\" (energy) and try to make it sound as if it was okay? I'm sorry if this seemed a bit long winded. Thanks for all your help with our journey here. 2012 is coming and I also feel it's going to be quite a ride. Answer: Thanks for your comments. All the changes you're going through are tests of your resolve to move forward. They are part of the rocks in YOUR path on the rocky road. Cancer would be hit hard by all these changes as that sign can get quite upset by them. As I've said in M5, once you're on the rocky road, you WILL shed tears. That is part of the separation from the Game. If you hang in there, the rewards will be major. Monroe's term 'loosh' has been covered in M5 and probably earlier on this group site. You'd do best to start from the first message and move forward. Lots of stuff new to you there. I rarely rehash material that is already in the book or on the site. Monroe was a Scorpio and did cover-up many things if he thought people couldn't handle them and for other reasons. While 2012 is coming, most people here won't make it to that year. It’s going to get MUCH worse MUCH sooner than those who'd like to think they have 10 more years of life as it has been. They are only fooling themselves. Enjoy M5 Question 340: To what degree is an infants conscious awareness a factor in it's communication with it's higher self? Answer: First, the newborn must not be a minion incarnation. If it is, that's something entirely different. If it is a Higher Self incarnation, it is quite aware at first but unable to convey it. Whenever I am out & about, babies always stare at me as they can see things few adults can. This ability is cut off as the body takes control and the DNA commands do their 480"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"thing. After that it'll depend on the level of advancement of the spirit stream in that incarnation. The Higher Self will always ensure that the Plan for that incarnation is completed and not halted.

Question 341: \"Am I right to assume that the primary entry of this crap energy floating around at the moment is through the solar plexus chakra? (it seems that this is the spot I personally feel twinging and have to protect when I see this grief and anger and hatred propaganda going on in the media) Maybe that's personal for me.\" Answer: The solar plexis chakra is the center of one's defense mechanisms. The sharp feeling you get there when someone betrays you, for example, is the chakra closing down in defense to protect you from any more harmful input. While that is your sensor chakra, you can be attacked through any chakra. When THEY want to try and close you down, they attack the crown chakra (Higher Self connection), the 3rd eye chakra (clairvoyance) and the throat chakra (clairaudience). They only attempt these attacks when the person is Advanced enough to use them. Question 342: I currently use gold light, and a T-i Takyon capsule, but to be honest, I feel they have helped me some, but fundamentally, my situation is not that different from before. I still feel I must struggle against these externals, rather than transcending them through attracting a more desirable experience/situation where I am no longer subject to unwanted influence (be it electromagnetic, astral, or telepathic). Answer: You seem to be looking for a 'magic bullet' and Teflon shield of some sort. You cannot force Advancement. Your Higher Selfs plan includes MANY stages of development. You read about what I'm doing at my level (Awakened Final), but I had to go through ALL stages from 1st Low on up. You cannot have the experiences of an Awakened Final until you are in that incarnation. You need to do the best for where you're at. There is NO 'magic bullet' or Teflon shield because your Higher Self needs/wants the experiences of your level. The T-i and gold aura WILL do what they are supposed to, but if you need an experience of some kind, you will forget to wear the T-i or place your gold aura, thus allowing an incarnational event. This is part of YOUR Higher Selfs Plan. The incarnation can never circumvent the Higher Self. While you are your Higher Self, your physical body is strictly a vehicle for the spirit and has it's own DNA commands, etc that the spirit must eventually overcome. Question 343: I just feel that perhaps my desire to use a T-i(and other protective methodologies), which is good I agree, still does not directly address the inner issue that I feel I can be manipulated, which I have to overcome to wink on out of here. Answer: You will be manipulated, to certain degrees, by the Game until you have completed your 3rd density incarnational cycle. As I said earlier, your incarnation, although the final in this time stream, is not the Awakened Final to spiral out of the Game. The Awakened Final has these answers. You must learn to trust in yourself (not in your incarnation). 481"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"Question 344: Is defense not just another word for counter attack and in that respect the same? Try not to think in linear time. Answer: YOU are thinking linearly, by your definition, as well as very 3rd density while the matter being discussed is gold light, a \"beyond 3rd density\" phenomenon, and the T-i capsule ,which is pure defensive. When you progress spiritually you will discover that defense is defense and NOT counter attack, which is attack. Defense wards off attack. Your comments reflect pure mid level thought. Attempts to preach to those more Advanced, when you don't grasp the concepts, are flawed.

Question 345: This may be silly, when you \"saw\" the silver cords going \"down\" to the incarnations, this was a metaphorical vision, right? or have you actually seen how higher energies Condense into third density!? Answer: Not a 'metaphorical vision', wrong! This is what they look like. Yes to your second question, but I have nothing more to say on this at this time. If you are to know more on this, your Higher Self will reveal it to you. Question 346: I’d say yes to this but; can a final or very advanced incarnate into a body that's less than desirable? i.e.., a cripple from birth or someone who's slow etc. it's all experience and if that's what the HS chooses....yeah, but my conditioning makes it hard to image some advanced soul with downs syndrome or drinking beer/watching football. Answer: Your Higher Self picks the conditions of the physical body. I would think it unlikely that an Advanced and above Higher Self would choose to be retarded. Your second example is either a mid or low level incarnate, as I've said in M5. Once one reaches the mid- Advanced and above stages, there is a need for Advanced knowledge. Let that be your guide. Otherwise consult with your Higher Self. Question 347: Hi. you do define things in the book but the word \"spirit\" just appears, as in \"mature spirit\" etc... is this something other than the Higher Self and closer to the mind/body complex (like what dion fortune and folks say; soul is what's connected/ distinct from the Higher Self)? Answer: If one is reading M5, they should know what 'spirit' is and don't need to have everything spelled out for them. All incarnational spirits are extensions of that Higher Self. Even minion incarnations are extensions of the animal group soul. Some people want to over complicate things. I've made them simple to understand. Question 348: In regards to the 'prayer of becoming' (I am a human becoming, help me to become” from the Handbook for the New Paradigm): the help requested is addressed to the Higher Self. But is it possible to view the Higher Self as yet another external god, one that 482"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"you gotta stroke/appease the right way to get the connection? (I grew up in a catholic home and am very sensitive NOW to any hint of playing the victim and going outside of myself for salvation). Would a statement like \"I am a human becoming, I will become\" not avoid my concerns of falling back into my conditioned understanding of a god external. Will I still receive the benefits of the exercise if I tweak the phrase? Then again, am I just being paranoid and hung up on semantics? Answer: That you don't understand the basic nature of the Higher Self (or you wouldn't have asked THAT question) indicates you are dealing with matters too Advanced for you at this time. The Higher Self is well defined in M5 ... to those ready to grasp it. As for the \"I am a human becoming\" is fine for those of low through mid-level Advanced, once one is in the Very Advanced, you know you are NOT a human. Anyone who tells me that they are \"only human\", I say 'too bad, I'm not’. Those in the Very Advanced stages up, who would like to use the Handbook's mantra (NOT prayer), could say \"I am having a human experience. Help me to become who I really am.\" Another problem you seem to have is inability to adapt something like the Handbook’s mantra to fit you. Once you are able to, you advance quicker.

Question 349: In your experience (and I address this to anyone that's had one), was the movement from that of an Unawakened Final to an Awakened Final a dramatic transformation in a moment of \"clarity\" (for lack of a better word) or was it more of a gradual process over days/weeks/months? Answer: It was definitely a transformation. Even after accessing my Higher Self AND being told by my Dominant Incarnations, the concept was so new to me that it took a while to comprehend. Fortunately I was able to speak with Monroe right after this experience and get much needed input. It still took time (years) as who you are and what's next now that you know unfold. Your Higher Self won't dump it all on you at once, but wants you to be able to handle the HUGE responsibility of being a Final. Awakening is just the first stage. Yesterday I was visiting someone whose husband (late 6o's) got on the Final Incarnation bandwagon as soon as I talked about it. I knew time would tell. Yesterday he was SO wrapped up in the Game (eager to 'die for my country', racist 'red dot' people comments and much more) that I knew he was not a Final. There are certain things an Awakened Final would definitely not say/do and dancing to the Game's current pop hits is one of them. The desire to be the Final Incarnation is an ego thing. SOMEWHERE and SOMETIME you are your Higher Selfs Final. If you are one now, there are certain things that must be shown to you. If you are not destined to be this Final, nothing you can do will change it which is why I say be happy with where you are and trust in your Higher Self. Question 350: \"On the subject of the Orion agenda of control being expressed more and more through the militancy of female earth humans. I can't make up my mind as to whether this idea has warped my mind or opened my eyes.

Stay tuned, even MORE new information will be coming out. This is NOT the ideal time to experience the female gender. The ideal time for it ended in the mid 1800's (which was my last female incarnation <one of my Dominants>. Women were Real 'females' from this time PAST. Now they want to be men. There are some very Advanced females today, but they are in a struggle to overcome their Orion programs.

Question 351: \"A gay friend of mine refers to all kids as baggage. But this little guy is \"baggage\" I'm fully responsible for. Again, the above isn't just an academic question for me. Answer: Yep, all kids ARE baggage to him. Kids are a low and mid level event in evolution. This can extend through low Advanced stages as well. They are ties to the Game and force the bearers to continue playing the Game. Just because he isn't to you doesn't change things. Again, you are looking for conformity instead of individuality. You must overcome that rock in your road in order to progress. Question 352: \"I'm the legal guardian of a 5 year old boy so let’s say hypothetically he's in the scenario and another man, the three of us came back from hunting (crossbow's in hand) and the Mounties pull up, court order in hand, wanting to take my son and I back into town for the mandatory vaccine shot for the latest bio-terror (our names were flagged on the computer since we didn't register for the vaccine \"voluntarily\"). Rather than introducing their shot of diluted virus, and whatever other destructive chemicals said vaccine is laced with, into our healthy systems, I'm thinking I've got a pretty good shot at the guy with my bow before he makes it from his cruiser to my front door (needles to say the black tourmaline stone in my pocket isn't repelling him). Defense or offence? Or is this where I throw in the towel? Answer: First of all, you reaction indicates what experiences YOUR Higher Self desires from your incarnation. Another thing, black tourmaline doesn’t repel physical entities. Killing the cop, as you said above, is definitely offense (excessive force). What you fail to grasp is that this may well be the experience your Higher Self desires. You are looking for black/white solutions to every situation. THEY DO NOT EXIST. Individuality and experience is what counts. What your Higher Self may want to experience, someone else's may not. Question 353: ... \"Until I complete my 3rd density cycle inevitable I'll be manipulated by the game to some degree.\" Answer: Until you are an Awakened Final (only one out of HUNDREDS of your Higher Selfs incarnations) you are manipulated by the Game. In mid-Advanced levels, you start removing Game restrictions/manipulations. In Very Advanced, you have removed yourself 484"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"from most Game manipulations. This is due to the rapidly Advancing spirit using the body. An Awakened Final, while not manipulated by the Game, must still play the Game (work, taxes, and such). After all, that is one reason why we're all here. You are still body controlled, IN the Game if you want kids, an opposite gender marriage, want the approval of others over yourself, and so on.

Question 354: When does one cross the line from defense to offense? And are some \"offensive\" actions self-defense or still attack dressed up in new clothes? ... Answer: This difference is very clear to those in Final incarnations, very obvious. Defense becomes offense when you use more force than necessary to halt an attack. The US government is in full offense in the war, bombing everything they can. South Park said it well this past week. Question 355: I'm still a little unclear as to the relationship between one's higher self and how shim impacts an incarnation in 3rd density in day to day life. For instance, are my desires and my actions a result of my 3rd density incarnate making decisions and my higher self observes these decisions and observes our incarnational progress based on our current thinking and ways, or is our actual thinking our higher self living through us and my thoughts, desires, subconscious actions etc. are really shim’s thoughts? I’m not foolish enough to believe in coincidences or accidents, but where does my will coincide with my higher self s will, if that makes sense. Answer: You will have to find that out for yourself and when your Higher Self is ready to inform you, shim will. All I will say on this is that each incarnation is here for experiences. If the Higher Self intervened on everything, you wouldn’t be getting proper experiences. The rest of your question will have to be answered by YOUR Higher Self. Question 356: My Higher Self made me overcome ‘the need to get upset’ with the female dominance you see everywhere. M5 tried to enforce it but at the end its all part of the Game. I do like you mentioning this stuff but I see a lot of concern regarding the female shit. At the end it all doesn't matter - so why bother with it like this? Answer: So, your Higher Self \"made\" you overcome something, did shim? A Higher Self will never \"make\" you. That you say that shows you have not yet understood the relationship between your incarnation and your Higher Self. There is no reason to ’get upset’ over any particular facet of the Game, BUT there are many reasons to become as familiar with the Game's manipulations as possible to learn. You comment like someone else I know that \"it doesn't matter\". It certainly DOES matter. You are trivializing the experiences your Higher Self chose to have. Events can be secondary to your Path, but never to be dismissed by a person in the Very Advanced and Higher stages of incarnation. If nothing matters to you, why don't you just die? Why be here if everything is so insignificant to you? That you haven't dropped dead suggests that your Higher Self has more ’insignificant’ items for you to try and ignore. This is also the second message you have submitted that demonstrates that you are not yet ready for this group. If something is of no concern to you, why do you think it is of no concern to everyone else or at least some others? Conformity rather than Allowance is your current mind-set by what you've written. 485"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"It's time for you to find others of your level as this material is for those who can understand the WHYS and SIGNIFICANCES of what is placed here. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Ouest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 357: I would like those who have experience in the astral to offer insight to the accuracy of this thought concerning matters of \"ancestry\". Being that we are incarnated into a large variety of cultures from different time periods simultaneously, ancestry truly doesn't matter. It only matters in the sense of specific genetic memory for this incarnation which, just like Orion genetics, is overridden by the advanced spirit. Concern over ancestry is body identification. We have incarnated into the cultural traditions we are in only because of what our HS wants to gain from the experience. Once the spirit has advanced to a certain level, ancestry and cultural traditions don't mean shit. I raise this because many cultures have a high reverence for ancestors and some hold ancestor communication rituals. I see these rituals as communication with lower astral spirits who still hold attachment to activities on the earth. A spirit who has given up their attachment to the earth would not be able to be contacted during a ritual or séance for they have moved beyond the earth and have no interest in coming back to visit. Further insight is greatly appreciated. Answer: You are correct with what you have w T ritten. The ancestor worship thing, the need to 'continue the line' and fixations with family heritage are ALL part of the Game’s mechanism to keep you in the believes that you are your body and you have only one incarnation. This is discussed in the M5 materials. If you don't have it, get a copy. If you do have it, reread it. The same goes for lower astral beings and recently dead relatives. Any more insight than is written in M5 on that topic is something YOU should access within your own Higher Self and you can, if your Higher Self wants you to know. There are many answers that you MUST discover on your own and not have handed to you just because you want the answer. \"Further insight\" is yours to discover as the tools for this are contained in M 5 . Question 358: In M5 you write that opposite gender sex shorts you out. But what exactly is the effect? What do you mean with shorting out? i.e., does it decrease your ability to astral travel? Answer: If you would have read M5 correctly, you would know the answer to the above. Hetero sex negatively impacts all your higher functions, reinforces alien DNA commands and increases your opposition to spiral out. It's worse if you have children as that strengthens your desire to remain in the Game. Any more and YOU have to figure it out. You'll understand more when you reach Very Advanced levels. You also should re-read ALL of M5. Question 359: It was stated that after M5 was published, it was put on display in the library on level 27. If there is no time/all time in higher densities (or maybe it seems that way the higher the density one is in), then wouldn't M5 have been there all along? 486"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"Answer: M5 wasn't on display until it was published in 3rd density due to a loophole in the Game's rules. I'm not going to say any more on that, other than to other VERY Advanced or Finals. Anyone not at that level would ask just what you did. I will tell you that I was very surprised when it was announced to me that M5 was placed on display. You can get more info on that when you go there. The new Gold Edition of the book simply took the place of the second edition when the Gold Edition was released. Question 360: Is everything that’s ever been written in 3rd density, in the library in some form? This would include such things as journals, a stray thought scribbled on a pizza box, a phrase written on the head of a pin (there are several of these in museums). Are there rules/guidelines as to what is put in the library on Monroe focus level 27, such as they have to have been published? Answer: You're being a bit silly with some of those items (shows where you are not... yet). You won't, for example, find porn in the Library, although, if you had a mind to do so, you could instantly create it. BUT if that were the case, you most likely would not be on 27. 25, yes, 27 not likely. When you eventually are able to access the Library, you can ask what gets placed there and why. A clue for you on that deals directly with individual Higher Selves. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 361: From what I've read and think I understand, thoughts aren't just in one's mind (ie. not private). Thoughts are energy that are projected from an individual, so everyone that is sensitive enough on 3rd density can 'read' people’s thoughts. This phenomena is just more obvious in the higher densities I would imagine. One of my questions- is there a collection of all thought? I'd imagine there are at least some important/profound thoughts that never made it to paper. That would make an impressive collection! Answer: Not in the form known as the Library on 27. EVERYTHING EVER created is stored within Higher Selves and all other beings originating from the Source. There are far more impressive 'collections' than the Library on 27, but that is awesome in itself from a 3rd density perspective. Any more and you'll have to Find out when you're ready. [Ed: See also the segment discussing the distorted concept of“akashic record”] Question 362: You mentioned that a Dominant and Final incarnation are formed of \"several points of past incarnations\" - suggesting the accumulation of experience and intention. It's easy to understand this from a lineal time reference, but again, if all action is taking place simultaneously, how does this work? Answer: You want to understand beyond your current level. This is impossible. I have no problem understanding but you will not be able to grasp this until your Awakened Final Incarnation, wherever in time that one is. Handle what you can and push the rest to the side and, mostly, trust in your Higher Self. 487 j ■i"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"Question 363: You talked about the \"percentage\" of various incarnation levels active in the Higher Self and how that percentage changes as experience is accumulated. Again, how is this possible if all incarnations are simultaneous? Answer: The percentages are cumulative within any one incarnation. This is not the same as the total within the Higher Self. You will understand this in your own Higher Selfs Awakened Final Incarnation.

Question 364: I guess I'm having a mental block at the 3D level which may not be resolved unless viewed from a higher, timeless level of perception. Anyway, I'd appreciate your input. With hundreds of simultaneous incarnations spread across various timeframes, how does the Higher Self \"accumulate\" experience if they all take place at the same time? Answer: Hundreds AND hundreds of incarnations. The Higher Self does process the flood of experiences/information very well and efficiently, but I cannot explain the ‘how’ that you seek within the limitations of the English language. You will understand when it is necessary for you to do so. Never forget that you ARE your Higher Self without the limitations of the physical incarnations. Question 365: Thanks so much for making the Matrix V material available. I am presently reading the material for the second time. As you suggested, I have also read the Monroe trilogy. Your material by far makes the most sense to me As I have found myself quite immersed in “finding the truth”. I am so glad I found it since it cuts thru all the crap. I find especially the type of reactions I am getting from my \"friends\" to be quite typical of those you describe when someone \"spirals out\". The most peculiar set of circumstances have come to me since August 2001. I refer to this as my awakening. I found myself developing an almost compulsion to research ancient history, metaphysics and catastrophism. This lead me to the “Zetatalk” site. As I read this and other types of similar material, It was almost as if, I knew it already. Then, I had the three dramatic UFO sightings, mixed in with strange “dreams” and physical manifestations. I underwent regressive hypnosis to help in figuring the experience out. The results of the hypnosis seem to indicate I have this “dual” presence or “awareness” as both my present male identity and a female “light bodied” alien. I recalled two experiences of dying on Earth (rather violently) and ascending in a column of “light” into a “craft” and being “reassembled” into a body. I also had several “visions” of the Earth’s demise. I also indicated their would be some kind of existence in a different “dimension” for a much reduced population. This all came to me before reading Matrix V. Since all this, I am regularly meditating and have been in touch with Dr. Darlene Miller at the Monroe Institute. I have some of the Gateway material on order. Dr. Miller reassured me and mentioned there seems to be an increase in abductees/contactess with similar experiences. My question is this, Is the regressive hypnosis experience really a communication with your own higher self ? (I think it is). And, this business of recalling several “off world” experiences as well as “seeing” the planet from above on a ship of some sort, interacting with other “aliens” (Some light beings, some short ones with big eyes) Is this me really looking around the “ship” of my higher self ? 488"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"Answer: Hypnosis is NOT a conversation with your Higher Self. It does unlock memories, some of which may not be reliable. The Higher Self can be very fussy about communicating with the incarnation. You will not experience at will communications with the Higher Self because that would be a breach of The Game since Earther incarnations are with blocked access until certain final phases of the Earther experience. Even then it isn't unlimited, even in a Final Incarnation. This, again, is a segment of the Game rules. When your Final Incarnation is completed, THEN you become your Higher Self and proceed onward. You most likely did have alien incarnations, but when you chose the Earther path, you submersed yourself in the experience. There are aliens hanging around the Institute and not all are 'good'. If what you 'see' are aliens, then you are not in your Higher Self since you'd see far more Earther incarnations than aliens and the alien incarnations are not of concern once on the fast paced Earther path. Your death and entry into a light to be reassembled shows that you have been sucked up into the alien light trap to recycle your soul to fit their purposes. As I've said in M5, do NOT go into the light. Once you are consciously aware of this, you will end that cycle. Most likely the aliens you see watching are waiting for you to die again so you can be recycled. Your Higher Self will allow this experience, and it is an experience, for you to learn something. You'll have to take that up with your Higher Self. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 366: To The Author: Just recently while on a trip outside the U.S., while I was sleeping, I had my first experience within my Higher Self (first experience that I can consciously recall). I distinctly remember going very rapidly through a tube (extension from the Higher Self to this incarnation just like the Higher Self picture from M5). I then had a very strong sensation that \"I\" (Higher Self) was MUCH MUCH more than the me that I see in the mirror every day. The feeling was VERY intense...the real me (Higher Self) is like a small universe compared to my incarnational self. I was INSIDE my Higher Self...it was that strong feeling of KNOWING who/what/where you are without needing to hear someone/something confirm it. I then saw the various points of light (the 'heads' of various incarnations that are in the Higher Self picture) but I never got close enough to see any distinct features on the 'heads'. I had no interaction with any of my other incarnations but I KNEW I was inside my Higher Self. The feeling was VERY strong that I, the incarnation, am just a small part of the real me and that my Higher Self is vast in comparison to my incarnation. When I went through the tube I felt as if I went through at 'warp' (best word I can think of in this language) speed. When I reached my Higher Self, it was almost like going to another universe....but there was no doubt that it was my Higher Self! It was interesting to experience the \"real me\" and get that first hand knowledge that I TRULY am my own God. Anyway, I know that I have a tremendous amount of growing to do in this incarnation and on many other levels also. I accept where I am and again I appreciate the info that you've taken the time to provide. I just wanted to share my latest experience with you because I knew that you would understand what I'm saying better than anyone I know. Answer: Response from The Author: VERY good! Yep, you got inside your Higher Self. That only happens to 2 types of incarnations: Dominants and Final. It'll be up to you to find out which you are. No other incarnations will be able to enter. It is MOST impressive when you get in there and the picture on the M5 cover does not do it justice. Like the column, in the middle of the Higher Self artwork, is not so tall, but rather waist level as you stand next 489"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"to it. That drawing is a good one, but not totally accurate. Even so, it serves its purpose. Now you KNOW. That's FAR better than belief as no one can take that away from you. Knowing is where it's at! Fascinating, no? As for your trip - good for you. You WERE following your Higher Self by going there. America is SO electronically wired that it is difficult to do what you did. They do NOT want Earther incarnates to KNOW. As you see, your Higher Self just made sure you were at a location where you could access freely for the first time. Now that you have, you should be able to do so in the US. As I've said in M5, NOTHING will prevent the Higher Self from fulfilling shim's incarnational purpose. Good for you!

Are there any book(s) that you can recommend that give accurate info concerning the chakras that are not tainted by lightside fluff? Answer: I don't know of any books on that topic that are not padded with Dark or Light polarity disinformation. \"Hands of Light\" by Barbara Ann Brennan is a classic on the chakras, but this is also a Lightsider approach. The best I can suggest to this Forum's level is that you'll have to rely on YOUR Higher Self to pull the weeds from the flowers in these books. Her book has many neat color drawings. Remember we are in The Game. Except in exceedingly rare cases, books on higher topics are either Light or Dark polarity which is why they are allowed to publish. Both with M5 and The Handbook trilogy, private publishing allowed them to come to print as they do not serve The Game but rather those sincerely seeking to spiral out.) Question 368: I was wondering how you feel about the 'merkaba' the flower of life workshops help you to create. It is based on sacred geometry and also refers to the planetary consciousness grid. I'm going to attend a workshop because they help you contact your higher self etc. Altough I will actually have to deal with their 'ascended master' disinfo, it will probably be a good learning experience in regards to meditation, Just wanting to check this 'merkaba' is actually valid and not some control technique they want me to cast around myself. Answer: After what I've just written about 'ascended masters', you ask me a question like this?! If an 'ascended master' is behind something like this, you are taking a risk which is at least financial. However if your Higher Self wants you to learn a lesson, well...either way, it's not so much what <I> think about this, but what YOU think about it. There are NO shortcuts to contacting your Higher Self. Monroe's methods are all self-reliant and involve none of the power stealing 'ascended masters'. You always receive guidance from your Higher Self, however you cannot force your way within until you have Advanced enough and are a Dominant or Final incarantion. Your Higher Self will bar your way if your current incarnation is not chosen to be one of the ones with access. So-called 'sacred geometry' is NOT sacred. Nothing is 'sacred'. They also are NOT connected to the Planetary Spirit who NEVER operates through one of the bogus 'ascended masters'. This group is pushing all the buttons that low Advanced through mid-Advanced love to hear. Once you reach ABOVE mid-Advanced, you will understand better. 490"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"Question 369: If you think about it, any being that portrays a gender identification hasn't \"ascended\" beyond 4th density. All you have to do to be on 4th density is end a physical incarnation. No great spiritual mastery is necessary for that! Having gained so many insights from Matrix V, I can now laugh when I read/hear a so-called ascended being talk about balance while identifying itself with a gender and having followers present a very human-appearing portrait of the entity. Now, when I encounter that type of material I can, if I choose, attempt to deduce what the true source of information is, such as some astral entity, some ET faction, some NSA/NWO satellite transmission (like Stewart Swerdlow discusses), or some New Age religious fabrication. Also, regarding Stewart Swerdlow, if anyone reads his new book and examines his comments on sexuality, they will see a corroboration of what The Author mentions about Swerdlow in Matrix V Q&A. When I read that, I also began to think about magnetism vs. electricity as being a misunderstanding of sorts, in that electricity is merely a subset of electromagnetism where energy is focused into a current instead of remaining in a field. When magnets attract, it wouldn't really be \"opposites\" attracting (a violation of the Law of Attraction), since a magnet actually contains both polarities. If someone has any other relevant insights about magnetism and polarity I’d appreciate hearing them. Answer: Excellent comments. You are correct. It's all about manipulation. Other examples are 'angels' being male or female or 'angels' at all; mormon heavens composed of men and women and in their highest 'heaven' the women have 'spirit babies' (yeah, right) - to name 2 more. The Game is loaded with flashing lights, confetti and other distractions to distract you from learning and spiraling out.)

Question 370: Since last week, events things have happened on the 3d that just cannot be ignored. The narrative of those events is as follows. Monday- I became very ill while I was at work and was not sure If I would be able to make it through the day. I asked a female coworker who I had gotten to know very well to drop me off at my apartment which was just 10 minutes away during her lunch break. She created a bunch of excuses and refused to do it even though I had there for her whenever she needed me. So I had to spend a miserable day at work before leaving on my own accord. Every day during the week I experienced related incidents. THIS ALL HAPPENED THE WEEK AFTER I JOINED THE M5 FORUM. I have never been treated like this before by people. This is the vilest that people have ever treated me in my entire life. I can take it that my higher self wants me to experience all of this and that I should just hang in there. I can also see that I am definitely on the right path to make people act like this. They all know I'm spiraling out of the game and they don’t like it one bit. I CAN ALSO SEE MY PROGRESS IS MORE ADVANCED THAN I THOUGHT because they came at me with all guns blazing. Doing all they could to deter my progress however I know that shim is awakening me daily and that I CANNOT FAIL and that this is just a bump on the road. My higher self is trying to get my attention that its time for me to advance and that I have some very serious things to do in this incarnation. From now on I will be in observation mode and will not feed the dark polarity by reacting to it. Shim is making me realize that my higher self has serious info to discuss with me but I have to be ready to receive it. My higher self wants to actually communicate with me on a higher level I can FEEL its presence. I just have to be ready when that occurs and this week was a example of that.\" 491"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"Answer: These are excellent observations of what happens to someone who significantly alters their direction to spiral out of the Game. It registers in one's aura and, this person, being male, has unsettled the females in his environment. Females, obeying their Orion DNA commands, can sense a male who won't conform. They take actions based on that non- conformity/non-submission to the female. If you still don't give in to them, they will cut you out and, hence, the lonliness can really set in. These are tests allowed by your Higher Self to see if shim's incarnation is strong enough to control the body's reaction and male Orion DNA commands to bend to the female's will. If you stick to the spiral out, rewards follow. If you choose to cave in and fall back into the Game, well, that's what experiences are all about. Good for you, Khalil. Be strong and listen to what your Higher Self will tell you as shim IS observing shim's incarnation.

Question 371: Many of the questions that claim to be from FINALS in the book seem to have a negative slant on life .................almost viewing 3rd density as a curse or baneful existence....hence the urge to \"spiral out\". Is this the normal feeling of Finals? Since I do believe that I am not a final, but certainly Advanced (and possibly a Dominant), it would seem to me that if a Final is the most Balanced of all incarnations, then he/she would see 3rd density as an experience he/she is truly GRATEFUL for.... because the third density provided the appropriate experiences for self-knowledge and realization. Do you have to hate this world in order to leave it? Can there be no \"fond farewell\"? Thank you for confirming much of the \"earth shattering\" information that has been rapidly coming into my life these past few months. You have strengthened my resolve to trust my inner voice. Answer: Recognizing the Earther experience for what it is brings is bittersweet. Stick to the Law of Allowance and let those who wish to play the Game continue to do so, as they should, but do not let them invade your space and try to drag you backward. The purpose for realizing the polaric controls and illusions is that you can understand the purpose of the Game but you also need to spiral out. You've learned the manipulations of polarities and are put off by them. Unless you are, you will tend to want to continue them. You are a Lightsider from the wording you use: you \"hate\" this world and \"fond farewell\". You are talking as a polaric, which you still are and, therefore, cannot grasp Balance yet. You attempt to use Lightsider ’guilt' in what you've written. You will eventually move beyond your current views even if not in this incarnation. For now, though, the answer to your question is not what you're ready to hear in full. Question 372: \"I am reading through MV for the second time and realizing there is so much that I don't remember seeing the first time. Still, there have been major changes in my life that happened from the first reading. The other immediate female in my life is leaving the first of June. Our divorce court date is May 7th. I have no children. She has been reading MV but is mainly staying in the handbooks and still reading religious materials. She says that she needs to go back to her parents to take care of them because none of the other siblings are able. She also misses her son who lives in the same area. I think the main reason is because she thinks Planet X is coming in May 2003 and she has a better chance of survival in Minnesota than here in SW Florida. We have not been sleeping together since I read MV the first time. She still tries to get me to hold her as she calls cuddling.

I have thought about seeking future employment in a gay establishment to avoid having a female boss. I have even applied for employment in phone sex but now that I think about it body wise, it would not be wise. I am getting use to the idea of not having any fear and that I can do anything all on my own and get on with what I need to experience before end game. I think it would be really cool to hook up with a male near my level for energy exchange. I am not too interested in casual sex as I did my observation here locally in the gay scene and found no one attractive. I see how I need to change my whole lifestyle to focus on areas that I lack in. Taking care of my grandmother 24/7 does not allow me much time to position myself in area's where a teacher might find me. I have started smoking, drinking, and have been exposed to drugs again but these things are boring and I now understand the real abilities they suppress. I am going to distance from all females.

I think I will reward my body with more pizza than chocolate.I sure am glad the MV website has updates. Answer: Everyone’s Path is unique. Most situations we experience is due to our choice, whether good or bad. Which ever you choose, you will learn from, as I've written about in M5 and on later materials. Once you learn, you become unsettled and want to move on. Remember my materials on breaking an experiential loop. If you didn't learn from the first loop, you CHOOSE to go to another loop with the same basic experiences. You will do this until you learn (mature) and break the loop. I have written much on females as this is a center plank for the Game at this time. While lesbians are a major cut above het females, they are still females and aren’t above using men for their purposes even if not for sex. Very Advanced females do exist, but they are rare. There are LOTS of females in low Advanced thru mid-Advanced levels (more females than males). I've also touched on this in M5 and beyond. Smoking/drugs/alcohol are all escapes cloaked in 'I want my cake & eat it too' BUT the spirit knows shim can't appease both body & spirit at proven failed circumstances, hence escape. This, too, is doomed. The mature spirit breaks (fuck it all, <I> need a new life) the cycle in a non-destructive way. The female who wants you to move in with her will show to have her own agenda and spins a new web disguised as something else. Females can excel at that. Looking for a gay friend, in the gay scene, is almost always a waste of time. I know! The local gay social group is full of superficial snobs that are interested in only the physical. I have never found any friend there. They either want sex or nothing. I haven't found anyone who is interested in more than sex and superficial conversation common to those of low and mid level advancements. The head of the group, an older man, brought up to them about my Matrix 5, which I would have never done. Not one of them questioned me about it. I knew they wouldn't have. They haven't even hit the low Advanced levels yet. That's like on Showtime's Queer As Folk series. They are the most plastic and typical type of gays. Rarely do you see one there with any depth. They represent immature spirits in a body with Orion DNA commands for opposite gender shorted out, but they don't have the spiritual maturity MA TR IX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Given the fact that tremendous amounts of electricity flows through a male's body, exposing it to another that holds lots of water as the woman's body does, would cause it to short out. It's like putting an electric shock stick in a vat of water. What I wanted to know is how, or if, race is a factor in the matter. For example, you've said that the various races on Earth were created by the meddlers for different purposes. With this in mind I think it's worth asking: Do women from one racial group short out a man's system more than another? Which ones have the least affect? Answer: You don't have it quite correct. It's not that females only short out males, it's also that males short out females. They do it to each other as per alien DNA command structure. This is irregardless of race. It's an Earther human body thing. The shorting out process between male/female physical bodies is NOT limited to only sex. Sex can give the strongest jolt of spiritual suppression, hence the immense sex drives especially in males. The drive in males is stronger than in most females because the aliens know that the spirit is more likely to break free of the Game in a male body, among other reasons, therefore more sex to suppress the spirit. Also french kissing the opposite gender has the SAME shorting out effect as having sex. Simply holding hands with a member of the opposite gender will send the shorting DNA commands that will act as a drug to the physical similar to how heroin gets one addicted. This applies to those who are body ruled. This will continue until the spirit matures enough to override these physical commands and makes decisions that are spirit ruled rather than body ruled. Refer to the 3 segments on Bisexuality that I wrote. Question 374: I've just come back from a stay at Disney world and saw some things I'd like to comment about. One of the first observations was the logo of their newest theme park, Animal Kingdom. The logo is comprised of 5 representative animals' silhouettes, a gorilla was one; all facing inboard toward the middle and largest 'animal' in the logo which is a dragon. I don't believe I'm making too much of the significance of this. If I'm correct, Tarzan was supposed to be in Africa which is one of the \"lands\" of Disney's Animal Kingdom. The live Tarzan stage show was not in the Africa 'land' but in Dinoland. The mixing of people and reptiles, I believe, is once again portrayed. I also caught the significance of the \"pregnant take\" of the book \"The Proper Handling of Humans\" in the TV movie, Dinotopia. I appreciate your commenting on that. The perpetuation of the female dominance agenda was alive and all over the place. I call it the \"female brutality has become a reality\" syndrome. T-shirts with words like \"princess with an attitude\" or \"perfect princess\" and accompanying expression of a Disney princess character. There were several others that were even more blatant while, conversely, many T's for men were sports oriented and had the likenesses of Goofy, Grumpy and Dopey. Whereas these few examples might be relatively innocuous it still perpetuates the whole atmosphere of an agenda. Do you agree?

Question 375: I have recently been exposed to your site. I have already ordered the Matrix 5 and can't wait for it to arrive. I have couple of questions that are bugging me and I thought maybe you can help me. How does one know who is telling the truth? everyone is so convincing in their ideas and beliefs and when I listen to my heart I really and truly can not decide what is the truth anymore. I have found that the more I know it seems that the less I really know. Is this the case or am I losing it all together. I appreciate any input you can give me. Answer: I hope you enjoy Matrix 5. You will have to figure out who is telling the truth by investigating what they say. They ALL say it's the truth. Many of them actually believe it even when it isn't BECAUSE they fear knowing the truth. For example, Americans want to believe they live in the 'land of the free*. That is not true and never has been, unfortunately, but it is a powerful ILLUSION that people want to believe. People cling to illusions because if they faced the truth, they'd have to do something about it. It's far easier to live a lie in that regard. One thing to keep in mind is if they seek conformity, such as in organized religion and use guilt/sin/threats to cow people into obeying, IT ISN'T THE 'TRUTH'. You will pick up more on this when you read Matrix 5's materials. Ultimately, though, it's up to you to discover what is true for YOU. Question 376: I'm finding my ears burning when the media rants on about gay/lesbian fear issues and especially pro-body/gender ID perspectives. My blood doesn’t boil anymore as I prefer to engage in the law of allowance. However, I always seem to get my two cents (or $10) worth of comments into the conversations whenever possible. My question has to do with my current personal perspective on gender preference. I'm doing a second read on M5 as I may have missed it. However, in case it is not there, would you speak sometime on gender neutrality? Over the past several years, I've been loosing interest in gender orientation and sexual expression. I live in the San Francisco Bay area and one learns quickly to be accepting and in non-resistance for just about every experience and expression that crosses one's path. Up until about ten years ago, if asked, I probably would have said that I consider myself het. But over the past decade, I don’t find myself relating to either bi or gay as I've never been motivated to investigate those preferences. But to be honest, I'm really not interested in het either and now consider myself more neutral or androgynous. However, andro never seems to be a category that comes up in conversations on sexual orientation. Probably because it's a non-orientation. I do remember what it's like to have my sexual desire button pushed. Now, it is more like I'm out of that arena and in a different one. I do not consider this a problem nor a stumbling block but I am curious if you have a perspective here. Again, my thanks for M5 and your continued participation. The light bulbs keep turning on. Answer: What you refer to as 'gender neutral 1 would most likely compare to a transition state. Since you admit you were a het, but not yet (at least in this incarnation) able to take the next step, you are residing in a holding pattern - waiting to see what's next for YOU. One of the main reasons for Earther Higher Self incarnations IS to experience sexuality, not 495"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"abandon it. The neutral gear visits each of us at various times. This is part of the growth pattern. Another thing, sexuality is not 'preference' but rather 'orientation'. You can prefer a blue or a yellow shirt to wear, but sexuality involves body programming and spiritual need. The word 'preference' is used by the Game to trivialize orientation. You WILL move forward sexually when YOU are ready, so don't worry about it and let it develop within you. Just keep your mind open and continue to develop/Advance and see where the spirit takes you on YOUR path.

Question 377: Dear Sir: As for the questions I asked concerning the ancient genders and the issue of work I found the answers in matrix 5. I guess I really needed to pay a lot more attention to what I read. Coming to the realization that we are a slave race for the empire and what they did to ancient Earthers has really irritated my spirit. Like you have said we cannot do anything to change the game but to find the escape hatch is very true especially with the incredible amount of minion incarnations present. Just the fact that we have been conditioned, manipulated, and poisoned with all the chemicals and toxins placed in our food and drink, deliberately hording the knowledge of the universal laws, giving our power to aliens posing as god etc., has me reprogramming my entire consciousness. I can't seem to find anyone to speak to on the subject covered in Matrix 5 without them defending the system. How could people who consider themselves to be so educated fail to perceive what's going on around them. With the knowledge gathered from reading Matrixs,the Paradigm Conspiracy, the three handbooks and the christ conspiracy I feel totally out of place here. Family and friends don't even wanna take time to listen to me since they have started thinking I am crazy. I feel very restless at times and just wanna pack all my stuff and leave not even having a place in mind. To very good movies to share views on are the Truman Show starring Jim Carey and Battlefield Earth starring John Travolta. Keep up the good work and hope to hear from you soon. stellarborn7 Answer: :I'm glad you found what I've written on the Ancient Earthers. As with all my materials, there is a lot more, but I release what I feel needs to be released to stimulate those Advancing enough to grab these gems and run with them. All that you said about Earthers and related below is correct. The kicker of it is that despite ALL the Game manipulations from the past and present, the simultaneous Earther Higher Self incarnates are STILL able to defeat the Game and move on. THAT is important and gives you a glimpse of the abilities (to use a softer word) of the Earther Higher Selves. This is why we will depart while those sequential aliens continue with their Games. The reptilians are the oldest race in the galaxy and Earther humans are one of the youngest. The keys lie with the spirit, though, not with the physical. You won't get anywhere with someone who is not ready for the materials. They FEAR having to face reality and will defend the Game until THEY progress to the stages where they learn to rid themselves of it. Yes, this does make for the Casper syndrome (as in Casper the Friendly Ghost who couldn't find a friend because he didn't fit in with the others). Most of my time is spent alone. The more you separate yourself from the Game, the more alone you become. This is getting you ready for the next leap forward.

Question 379: You've stated that one chooses when and how one dies (prior to incarnating). My question is, would this mean that the 9-11 WTC disaster was predestined? A lot of Higher Self incarnates experienced death during that event. Given that so many HS incarnates died in one place at one time, I can't help but think that the event would have to have been predestined. Any thoughts? Answer: The 9/11 incident is only one in a HUGE line (throughout history) of bodies dying at the same time. Refer back to my segment on the Time Machine movie. Review what I wrote about death there. The Higher Self picks the manner of death (violence, disease, old age,etc) and the time. Random events will ensure that these do happen. The event itself isn't necessarily \"predestined\" as such, although those responsible for this particular event (and it's not who they're pointing the finger at) had plans well before the date. The dead people's Higher Selves saw to it that their incarnations were at a place & time to fulfill their chosen methods of death (violent: crushing OR burning OR explosion, etc). The problems come from concentrating on the physical death which shows body control with no regard for spirit. Question 380: Since the game supposed to go on to it's end, would the reptilians be able to use the cycles to their advantage to literally enslave the masses after 2012? Answer: Once the Earth cycle is done for the Higher Selves, the Game continues for the sequential incarnations. We'll have moved far beyond that. The Orion Empire has been enslaving people for ages before there were even any Earthers. They will continue on their path, however long it takes them. Question 381 I've just introduced myself to your material and have, so far, found it to be \"solid rote\" which I can utilize in my movement along my spiritual path. I have a little rote I'd like to pass on and that is why I've decided to write you. As a transgender persona, I have a male body and a feminine gender. I realize that I am not my body; gender is, in my understanding, however, a \"flavor\" or frequency nuance of my energetic essence. It has nothing to do with sex except where society has made the two into mutually inclusive terms (i.e. if a body is male, the gender must be masculine, as if the body is female, the gender must be feminine). Some who have bought into this \"requirement\" have decided to have a \"sex change\" operation, which in reality is simply becoming either a feminized eunuch or a masculinized eunuch! These eunuchs by choice still have gender, even though they no longer have genitalia. Therefore, I posit that it is the true genders (masculine and feminine, 497"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"not the sexes of the bodies, which are male and female) which should be understood in relation to the non-physical reality. Spirits are not male or female, but have you observed that they can be masculine or feminine in \"flavor\"? The second item of potential interest to you is that I am currently in a marriage relationship with a female; I and her are moving on the same Path together and we are mutually supportive of each other's progress, not trying to control or interfere with each other's progress, unless it is to stimulate a faster rate of progress. We both have studied the Monroe trilogy, have completed the Gateway tapes, completed a Gateway Voyage at the Institute together, and have both met Robert Monroe in person and conversed with him. We are both convinced that this is to be our Final Incarnation. We both have rather regular out of body experiences. We have been together for over 23 years, and even have a child. Answer: Thanks for your comments. I'm at the point in my path where I view the physical different than you obviously do. From my position, gender is male or female and sex is sex. You can call it whatever feels comfortable with you. Those who say they are either a man or woman ‘trapped in the wrong body’ are actually body oriented. The problem is with a corruption of the alien DNA commands. The spirit KNOWS it is neither male nor female but, as I say in M5, both in one. Those who desire to change their bodies to appear the gender opposite to what they were born are operating under the corrupt DNA commands, not a spiritual directive. However it IS an experience and the Higher Self will learn from it. Now as to why that individual Higher Self chose this direction and experiences can only be taken up with that Higher Self. It does reflect the total uniqueness of paths. The DNA commands actually SHUT DOWN, in the physical, the vibration of either the male or the female energies of the spirit and also imprint their commands on the incarnation. It is one of the goals of each Higher Self to override these DNA commands that try and convince a spirit that shim is either male or female. Enter the corrupted DNA commands and you have the trans-gendered issue. Right or wrong? No, just another type of experience that a Higher Self may choose. No more, no less. Trans-genderism holds no interest for my at my stage especially since it is a body concern, but that's my path. You misunderstand my reference to saying the flavor can be masculine or feminine. This is the taint of the Game, NOT something originating with the Higher Self. It is a lie/deception. Understanding the lie and moving beyond the lie's deception are parts of Advancing. As long as the physical is of such overwhelming concern to an incarnate, there are still lessons to learn. To find the why’s of your path, you must talk with your Higher Self. IF you are a Final incarnation, you have direct access to the Higher Self and the input of your Dominant incarnations. Monroe told my groups that. You claim to be \"convinced\" you are a Final incarnation. If you really are, you have the ability to have all questions about your path and Final status answered without any other intercession.

Question 382: To what degree to higher selves interact with one another? e.g., let’s say I murder you in this lifetime. Obviously we both chose both events before birth; did our higher selves meet previously and establish that I would be the killer and you the killed, so to speak? How do they come to that decision?

You also don’t have to agree to certain interactions as well. Those people who died on 9/11 are not connected to the Higher Selves responsible for the action but those Higher Selves set up a situation for those needing this death experience. It is far more complex than the simple explanation you are looking for. I've given some hints here, but for more, you'll have to take it up with YOUR Higher Self or research the Library on Monroe level 27. Question383: You stated that \"soul-mates\" is horseshit. However, what of entities that wish to have relationships with/interact with one another in more than one incarnation? Could these not be considered \"soul mates\" (though it's a truly horrible term) to some extent because they have an ongoing relationship from incarnation to incarnation? Answer: There is no \"if\" about it. Higher Selves DO arrange to experience various things with the same 'friend' on various levels. They are NOT 'soul mates'. That is a term warped by the Game and embraced by the Lightsiders. These incarnations can take many different aspects, even spouse, lover, significant other, but NOT 'soul mate'. The ONLY incarnation that can be considered a true soul mate, for 3rd density Earth purposes, is another incarnation of your Higher Self. You are mated to the same Higher Self. You seem to be hung up on using the Lightsider term as you are stretching to find a valid way to use it. In order to Advance, you MUST be willing to shed the baggage of the Game. Question 384: \"I found this article today. Even though I know the materials supersede the question, (and that this doesn’t belong to our higher self incarnational progress), * could it be possible that as a result of minions (animal group soul), previously incarnating in human bodies; these dogs (not the DNA composition)- are \"remembering\" certain knowledge in ways orthodox science can’t explain as the subject of minions and the animal group soul is not described elsewhere? (as far as I'm aware of). I'm pointing out the possibility that these animals (dogs), had possibly incarnated in human bodies before- and this resulting \"behavior\" is a possible result of \"previous learning.\" Answer: The Nature Spirit incarnates are on a different path but their Higher Self, the Earther Planetary Spirit, is as intelligent as our Higher Selves are. Describing that further is not where I want to go at this time. Check on what I've written in past M5 segments on that topic. Judging the actions of the Planetary Spirit by shim's lower level incarnations would be flawed just as it would be to judge an Earther Higher Self by shim's low level incarnations. Keep Observing! See also the segment: More On Nature Spirit Incarnations. Question 385: \"Last night I woke up about 4am, looked out the bedroom doorway towards the bathroom and saw an apparition (shape of a human but semi-transparent/cloudy). My objective was simply to find out what it was and what its objectives were. I simply 'thought' to the entity \"what are you doing and what do you want?...I have no intentions of harming you, I just want to know your intentions\" The entity did not respond directly and I could tell just by my perception of the particular vibration that the entity gave off that it was simply a spirit that was confused and wandering around. I then released the entity, let it go on about 499"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"it's business, then I laid down and went back to sleep. That is the second time I've seen an apparition in that apartment since I've been there. The first time it was a woman with long black hair and a night gown walking into the closet (I had no direct interaction with that entity).\" Answer: Most of the time, these entities are spirits of people, in your neighborhood, who are sleeping and just aimlessly wandering on the astral. Sometimes they are the recently dead. Sometimes, too, they are lower astral beings looking for trouble. My advice is never to invite an entity into your house when you aren't sure who they are and what their intent is. You could be inviting the 'vampire' in giving it permission to operate in your home. Keep your defenses up and use gold light creatively. Gold light would never harm a spirit that has no mischief in mind.

Question 386: \"I have had some very strong desires to kiss the guy I was just talking too. Yet I haven’t acted on this (body control I suppose), I am hopelessly hetro, I’m afraid.\" Answer: This is a great example of your spirit attempting to override the body DNA commands. That you had a \"very strong desire\" to kiss a guy is the spirit acting. When one kisses with the same gender, the two spirits involved pass some of their Higher Self energy in a non-vampiric way which is the opposite to that which occurs when opposite genders kiss (vampiric female draining male energy). The physical's DNA commands in the sexual areas are strongly implanted and reinforced by the Game-oriented society. Your comment about being \"hopelessly hetro\" is a defeatist mode surrendering to the body. A time will come when your spirit will make the body submit to the far greater control of the incarnating spirit and you will discover what you've been missing. Question 387: \"In your Observation: Signs you mention the. Disney Alien Encounter show. Can you tell me anything more about that program?\" Answer: I had just been contacted by an M5 reader who discovered further information about Alien Encounter on the web. Here's the address - http://www.extraterrestrial- aliens.com/i8.htm . It contains direct quotes from the video. I was surprised to read how rare it was to see that show with only 5 cities airing it. I was very fortunate to get it on video. Question 388: We have the 4 elements, as you say in the More on Nature Spirit Incarnations piece and spirit is the key, the 5th element. Can you add a bit more to that? Answer: Spirit is the key as it takes a spirit, either Higher Self or Planetary Spirit (depending on Path choice) to give life to 3rd density forms. Spirit is the god energy. Planets with no Planetary Spirit are dead, spiritless rock, which indicates the Planetary Spirit has departed to higher densities. Nothing can grow there. A planetoid, formed of matter, but never had life, is similar to a stillborn human. The spirit enters the body at first breath for a human. There was never a spirit in a stillborn. Hence, abortion is not killing a person as a person has a spirit. A Planetary Spirit, in a young planet, is volcanic or in other 500"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"early stages of development. Dead planetoids can form as well, but are never inhabited by a Planetary Spirit. These are usually chunks of a former planet, such as our asteroid belt after that former planet was destroyed by the Orion Empire's Death Stars (see Matrix 5 for more on this). Some alien cultures engage in terra-forming. This alters the composition of a planet making it favorable for a Planetary Spirit to choose to enter and give life. This is rarely done, but it does happen. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 389: How do I find out what level incarnation I am? Answer: The only levels of incarnation that are significant to know are Dominant and Final. The others just fit in according to the plan YOUR Higher Self has. Having an interest in the M5 materials places you somewhere in the Advanced stages. Where in the Advanced is for you to generally discover. There is guidance in M5, but the thing to grasp is that it doesn't matter where you are in your progression and that somewhere in time are your Dominant and Final incarnations. They are ALL you. Enjoy your current incarnation for what it is. Question 390: \"On Friday I rented \"The One\" and \"Planet Of the Apes.\" In \"The One,\" one of the many versions of Jackie Chan in the \"multi-verse\" ( a word from the movie which is supposed to be the universe including all the parallel universes) kept moving through a vortex to go from universe to universe. Each time he killed a version of himself, he got physically more powerful. The whole movie was based on inter-DIMENSIONAL travel, not inter-DENSITY travel which is different. It was all physical and centered on 'the answers' being locked up inside 3rd density existence. Yes, they had the knowledge and technology regarding inter-dimensional travel but the characters in the movie were still wrapped up in the 3rd density mind trap and felt as if the physical universes were the 'alpha and omega'. Also, the concept of going to a parallel universe/alternate reality where your individual incarnation exists as the same incarnation but a slightly different personality due to the environment does NOT fit in with the fact that the Higher Self (for simultaneous incarnations) extends into various incarnations for the VARIETY. Therefore, extending into multiple physical universes into the same incarnation would not serve a useful purpose for a Higher Self that chose the simultaneous path. There wouldn't be enough variety to achieve the rapid advancement of the Higher Self that comes with simultaneous incarnations. Yes, there can be other physical universes with different patterns of 3rd density existence, but NOT with a single incarnation existing simultaneously in the various universes/dimensions. I enjoyed watching \"Planet of the Apes\". It had the time travel theme. Aside from the great entertainment value, the MAJOR flaw that I saw regarding the time travel theme, was at the end of the movie when the human (Mark Wahlberg) goes back to earth during his own time and Thade (the Ape General) has apparently figured out how to time travel and changed the history of earth. Abe Lincoln is now APE Lincoln (actually it's just a statue of Thade the Ape General on a chair at the reflecting pool in D.C.) and the cops who come to the crash site of the human are all apes. This DEFINITELY doesn't fit in w/the simultaneous Higher Self plans. The game has certain elements that made it attractive to the Higher Selves that chose 501"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"to incarnate here. Therefore, it would not make sense to allow an individual incarnation to have the power to travel through time and change the very nature of the game (you spoke about this in one of your previous posts regarding travel to the future). Yes, time travel is possible, but the outcome of the game cannot be changed by an individual traveling through time. Things can and WILL happen to prevent or limit 'tampering' (ex. so called 'accidents' and other 'unforeseen occurrences').\" Answer: Very good observations on your part. What you said about parallel dimensions is correct As for Planet of the Apes, I like the film, but it's just for fun. You can astral travel to just about any time period but, since there is no such thing as time, one is just visiting different phases of simultaneous incarnations, [see Time Travel and The Game!

Question 391: Could you perhaps elaborate on the 'important information we receive during our sleep'? That we don't know about consciously and takes a while to assimilate? I've been waking recently with this nagging feeling that I've just learned something important, only to not remember a single thing. Answer: Sleep is important for a couple reasons, one being that the body rests/recuperates from having the high vibration of the Higher Self within. Another reason is that this is a good time for the Higher Self to send information that the incarnation needs either now or in the near future. The information tends to stay dormant until needed. This information is usually transferred to the incarnation in rotes (Monroe's term for bundled information). This information can be considered to be a zip file that you will unzip when required. I have no doubt that you DID learn something important to you. Don't worry over remembering it. You'll know what it is when it's time for you. With EndGame in progress and chaos in control, I'm sure many Higher Selves are downloading info to their incarnations especially in the Very Advanced levels. Question 392: Since you stated that sequentially incarnate Higher Selves, when the body dies, they reborn in a new alien body, (with all his past memories) why they use extending life drugs like “sma” or cloning techniques, as you said in the new observations? Answer: The only ones who use life extending drugs/cloning are the reptilian royals. Their queen is paranoid about death. Remember, the Orion reptilians, despite all their impressive technology, are not at all Advanced spiritually. I didn't say all sequentials use sma or similar drugs. The reference was to the Orion reptilian royals. Orion royals are also power craving. If the queen allowed herself to be reborn, she'd lose her queenship to another and would have to develop from an infant. Using drugs/cloning, she remains an adult and in power. Power is more important to them than just about anything else. Question 393: 1 would like to thank you for your answers. Although I think I made big steps towards spiritual maturity, the way you answered my questions brought me back to reality and made me realize that although the steps I took might be big compared to how mature I was before, they might not mean anything compared to the steps I'll have to take to be even more mature.

Question 394: \"I have been thru Matrix V and all the 3 handbooks. I have had the book since Nov. 2001. This is my fourth time through the complete text. This is a real eye opener and in many ways it is what I have been looking for all my Life. I was a Scientologist for over 10 years and it was hard to break free. It was just another experience. I don’t want to waste a lot of your time. I just have one question. I have been for the last 6 months looking within to contact my higher self. It has been a wonderfull experience and I have had some very deep and moving changes in my life. I am not one to go into any long or specifics but I will say that my certainty and knowledge is moving in the right direction. I am able to take responsibility for where I am today. I have one question? I have lost interest in work and I feel so serious about all the bullshit I see around me. All I really want to do is look within as much as I can. How do you keep all these silly games from making you feel sad, or just maybe don't really give a shit about anything except gain more knowledge of my self. Any suggestion or novel ways of thinking would be appreciated. Answer: Thanks for the email and I'm glad you enjoy the M5 materials so much. Look for more probably early next year and keep up with the site. I can't tell you how many times I've told Val how much I am unhappy being in the Game at my stage. It's one thing if you have people on similar levels (Very Advanced or higher in my case) around for you to visit with. I don't have any here (where do you live? maybe we can get together). It IS trying to be surrounded by 'the kids'. As to why you are, you have to check within YOUR Higher Self. I know why I am still here, but I really would like someone with me as it would make it so much easier. I STILL have to work my Mon-Fri job and STILL have to do what is necessary to survive. What I can say is that you still have things to accomplish. Trust in YOUR Higher Self is where you get the strength to continue. I don't doubt you have lower astrals hanging around you playing on your downers. They love that. Blast them with gold light and they’ll go away, but you must keep your guard up. They love to sidetrack someone trying to Advance. You also shouldn't be so \"serious\" about the Game. That you feel so says that you haven't been able to detach yourself enough from it, at the stage you're in. Strive for the Observer stance. It's much saner, but you have to reach it. Hope this helps! Question 395: I like to add one question in the series of your last article. For example: \"Why do you have to buy that big car\". You mentioned posturing in the Matrix V book. I think posturing has far reaching consequences. Especial for (young) men of course. A lot of 503"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"decisions are made to make impression of the other gender. But these are indeed pure body commands. I think a lot people don’t see that such behavior is a result of the breeding curse. In the Western society a lot of tools are presented for posturing, and people love to buy it, but they are forgotten why. This is a strong manipulation, and I hate that. Also the competitive behavior between men is for me a needle in the eye. It is for me a real jammer in friendships with other guys. The result of competitive behavior, is namely jealousy. If you are for example a good looking guy, men tend to be jealous, just for that, I just hate that. A couple of years ago, I read a book about the postulating thing. I was then not aware, that such animalistic behavior had such big impact on society. In fact it is occurring in all layers of society. That information was for me a trigger to step on the brake, and reconsider future decisions. Thank you for the M5 materials it is the crème de la crème. Answer: Ego problems are behind people who get noisy cars or others, like the short man who runs around in some huge truck (not for work purposes). Short men seem to feel they have to overcompensate for their size although it's in their minds alone. The list of questions can become quite long and cover all sorts of conformist or other matters.

Question 396; Is it correct that when you say you're out of here, collecting all your incarnations and returning to your higher self that all other simultaneous incarnations will be returning to their higher selves at endgame? I love your synopsis of the lightsider mindset as \"what's good for me is good for everyone\". Answer: What I wrote would apply to every Higher Self in the simultaneous path. This can happen at any time. We don't all end at the same moment. There are those Higher Selves (simultaneous) that have already moved on. Those that wanted involvement in EndGame will depart after that. It all depends on the individual Higher Self and shim's plan. Question 397: Is there a difference between acceptance and allowance or is the semantics of the two terms just picking the flyshit out of the pepper? Answer: Allowance is used when one allows someone to develop on their own with the Laws of the Universe in mind. Acceptance is allowance combined with approval on the part of the person making that decision. Allowance can be the person who has come to terms with a situation they don't approve of personally. Acceptance is not only coming to terms but also endorsing. This is why I don't attend weddings. Allowance says 'do what you want'. If I attend, it indicates my acceptance and I'm particular what I endorse. Question 398: I must admit I used to be part of a psychic astral travel forum, and this seems to have really led to a lot of this activity where dark figures enter our home, as if our coordinates are posted in some astral public restroom, e.g., \"for a good time, check out....\".

Question 399:Are our bodies affected in some way by larger celestial bodies, or is astrology yet another part of the Game for power and control over us by others, and a sign of subservience we adopt to \"explain\" our selves? Answer: Astrology is very valid and does influence the physical. A birth horoscope, provided it is accurate, will also lay out many of one's experiences and attitudes in life. It is a valuable, powerful tool for understanding the 'whys' of one's incarnation. The Higher Self chooses a physical that will allow the incarnation to have the necessary experiences for development. Astrology is also the most complex and difficult to learn of the predictive sciences. I frequently hear, \"I don't believe in astrology\". Well, that's fine, but astrology is not a belief system. I've read horoscopes of conservative, Christian types and the horoscope identifies this regressive delusion. The denial of'belief seems more to be based on the fear of what a horoscope may reveal ‘without the person's ok’. Polarities, both Dark & Light, prefer to deal in hidden agendas. Astrology can reveal these agendas. You should be able to connect the dots on this. Response: \"Thanks for the validation, I've been gathering quiet information from experience over the years, and connecting the dots all along. Having a Piscean body (Gemini Rising, Scorpio Moon), I've often noticed that I've yet to meet another Piscean with whom I've felt connected, beyond the mutual recognition, on the (un)conscious psychic levels, that we're somewhat relative. Upon further consideration, it seems that, like most people, they live against a basic background of fear, and have no real self-understanding of the tools and doorways their material bodies contain.\" Question 400: Can you comment on the inter-dimensional activity in the film, The One? Answer: I recently went and saw that picture. The premise in The One is that one incarnation, of a simultaneous Higher Self, could become insane and travel through the dimensions to kill off his other incarnations. By killing them, he absorbs their Higher Self streams and, thus, becomes more powerful. This is pure bullshit! For one thing, this would assume that any incarnation could so overpower the Higher Self that the Higher Self becomes a prisoner to the incarnation. Not even in Low incarnations is that so. An incarnation could never override the Higher Self incarnating it. Another deception here is that you are 'less powerful' when you are simultaneously incarnating. This is sequential incarnate interference/propaganda here. The number of incarnations does not limit the abilities of the Higher Self in any way. It's just the opposite, the Higher Self increases in abilities for taking the simultaneous path. 505"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"The One is Hollywood fantasy with a touch of sequential alien influence.

Question 401: \"I am waiting for my copy of Matrix V to arrive. I have been interested in astrology. How do I use astrology to force contact with my Higher Self? Answer: What you, as the incarnation, wants may not be what your Higher Self wants. Be assured that if you were to experience something, that your Higher Self would ensure that you do experience it. You cannot force something on the level you seek. If it is to happen in your current incarnation, it will. There are threads to follow in Matrix 5 that can assist the incarnation IF it is what that incarnation's Higher Self requires for that incarnation to progress. I am not your personal teacher nor do I see any reason to act in this role. When you get Matrix 5, read it. LOTS of heavy info in there. See where that info takes you next on your quest. Question 402: Is it \"easier\" for an incarnation to communicate with its IIS in the 4th density than in the 3rd density? Answer: Read M5 first for more info on this. I will add that if one is incarnated and out of body, the Higher Self energy stream is STILL moving through the physical when the spirit roams the astral. Hence, the body's alien filters are still active with what the roaming astral is experiencing. Question 403: I just finished M5 in its entirety. I think I learned a lot, but I need to read it about 3 more times to get the most out of it. Most people are starting to notice how I’m changing. They tell me what I am doing is called \"new age\". They really have no idea what connecting with the higher self is about and what is involved in learning the truth. I don't know if you have noticed, but David Icke has an article about what he predicts will happen during end game time. Seems to me like a very possible scenario. Answer: I'm glad you are getting much from Matrix 5. You WILL get more each time you read it. It is so designed. As you grow and begin to move beyond the limits of others, you will, as you have discovered, find that others become uncomfortable with you. FUCK 'EM. It's YOUR life, not theirs! As for David Icke, I do like his materials. The thing about David is that he is a Lightsider. His books are wonderful and I've read everything since Robot's Rebellion. I've learned to eliminate the Lightsider 'love & light' bullshit and stick to his non-tainted information. I'm looking forward to his new book.

Question 405: There is a Christian \"shrine\" just outside Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. It's called \"Mary, Queen of the Universe Shrine\". Any comments on this? Answer: The title itself is one of the titles used by the Orion queen. As a former catholic, I am very familiar with the litany of titles for the religion's fictitious mother of their fictitious god. Actually, they are terms that have long been used by those in the Orion Empire for their queen. These terms have been around for ages, long before Ancient Earthers were assaulted by the Orion/Sirian genetic scientists. The rise of 'Mary' worship is part of the Orion plan for the overt rule of Earth and being one of the Empire’s conquered worlds. One major difference between fiction (Mary) and fact (Orion queen) is that the first is portrayed as a Mother Theresa type Lightsider (the disguise), while the Orion queen is just the opposite. I checked on the shrine you mentioned and, if anyone is interested in reading a bit more on this place, read pgs 336-337 of The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2003 by Bob Sehlinger. While a lot can be said about the Mary thing, it is also interesting to point out that in the catholic national cathedral in Washington, DC, Mary has been appointed as 'protector/patron' of America, which is Orion reptilian (female) over Sirian wolfish (male). Observers can draw further conclusions about this if familiar with past Matrix 5 materials. It's gonna get even more interesting. Question 406: \"You said that ET's split the \"human\" sex from hermaphrodites to defined male and female forms, did they also split plants and animals to become male and female as well, or was there another way that they came about?\" Answer: No! You have not comprehended the segments on this topic. You are assuming everything on 3rd density was both genders in one. On Ancient Earth it was only the Ancient Earthers. That’s a simple statement, but when your incarnation is body ID oriented, you have difficulties with these higher concepts. M5 is not for people at your level. You would not have asked that question if you were at the level the materials are written for. Not only that, \"sex\" wasn't split - 'gender' was! 507"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge Internationa!

About five years before a year ago I tried to stop listening to any kind of music that had lyrics. Most of them these days talk about subjects that involve the GAME. Like sex, violence, and drugs, etc. I hate it when I enter a grocery store or place of business and they are playing a favorite tune from some time zone, and being familiar, the lyrics stick in my head for the remainder of the day or longer. In the past I would bring out another more suitable tune out of memory and hash it over and over until the undesirable tune left my mind player. Is this part of the dna commands to keep the lyrics repeating to control the command? I know in the weak the suggestion applied over and over usually creates manifestation. It seems some song lyrics are stronger in suggestion.\" Answer: The Game is everywhere. The key to what is played is not so much the lyrics but rather the music. For more on this subject of music & hidden messages, read The Music of Time by Nichols & Moon (of Montauk Project fame). Question 408: \"Short of going to level 27 in astral or someone like yourself is there a direct way to know this info in the 3rd density? \" Answer: You are looking for shortcuts. There are none. The schedule of YOUR Higher Self cannot be altered. It takes time and good teachers to develop one's skills in these departments. Question 409: \"How can 1 tell that the person 1 see in my presence is a sequential or simultaneous? For example I have looked at Bush jr and geb bush and am unable to tell that they are reptilian and hence sequential in nature. Am I missing something here that is supposed to be obvious? I would like to be able to self validate that which 1 get as second hand info but not through direct experience.\" Answer: Yes, you haven't Advanced enough to deduce this yet. You will not be able to until YOUR Higher Self allows it. Question 410: \"Do males have the 3rd dimension reality of a \"zinc anode\" to prevent female chi draining and also the male shorting out the female as well?\" Answer: There is NO way to stop this on a physical contact level. Both genders are wired only to short each other out with the energy draining ability part of the female structure. This is due to the male being the giver of life. IF you allow contact, you haven't Advanced enough to be free of this major loop experience. Question 411: \"Hello, Is the only difference between Higher Selves simply their choice of sequential or simultaneous incarnations? Or is there much more than that? Are there 508"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"different types, or species of Higher Self? If the Elite Bloodlines on Earth are sequential incarnations does that necessarily make them Reptilian? They may not be human, but then neither are we. What is it that makes them different from us? Are. they different? Could the game on Earth be just a small part of the main game taking place somewhere else?\" Answer: You are thinking in a body-oriented pattern. You are used to such 3rd density concepts as \"species\". In order to deal with higher densities, you must put aside 3rd density concepts. Here’s the answer I will give you: electricity is neutral, but when it activates machinery, it operates the machine's purpose. The electricity that runs a toaster is the same electricity that allows a drill, computer or electric chair to operate. Do you identify with the electricity or the machine. The same goes for residents of the 3rd density. You must also consider what I’ve written about the Game and experiences. If you are unable to grasp this, you aren't ready for the Matrix 5 materials. The answers you seek are located in the materials already. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Question 412: [Obviously English is not this person's first language] \"Can an incarnation speak with a higher self, and the higher self of that incarnation interact (through the current incarnation) with other humans? I ask this, because as we speak, I feel an urge to SPEAK, my whole body is burning me, i feel like a 'discharge' of energy flowing through my neck and then though all my body, down to my chakras.. And at this exact time, this 'energy' i fell is mine, I speak as I was me and someone else, and this someone else is me (but more clearer in the intentions and dialogue) I interacted with 2 incarnations of alex, and I gained much knowledge from this. Alex is awakening. Part of me is this and part of me is that, i do not know how to speak this clearly. Part of me speaks for me (alex) and part of me explain things in a more clearly way (i decided to call my higher self = Eagle). This is not a question, but rather, an interaction within myself, i do not know fully how to develop and control this energy that is flowing thorugh me in this exact moment. Any comments on this is appreciated, I am MUCH happy and at the same time 'feeling strange'. I give you my greetings, part of my learning involves your 'awakening ideas’. Alex. Answer: Your Higher Self is UNlikely to act in such a dramatic manner. Higher Selves do communicate with each other, but not through an incarnation unless both incarnations are Awakened Finals and even that would be rare. Lower astrals can influence you to believe what you think. They are responsible for possession cases. Higher Selves do not run around, through an incarnation of theirs, giving ’greetings’. Also, 'alex' has only 1 incarnation, so 'alex' cannot have 2! I feel that the 'strange' feeling is more likely to come from your Higher Self as a warning to you that you are being used by lower astrals. You invited this in. You will have to take care of it on your own or with local assistance. Your path/your experiences. Question 413: Is it that sequential incarnates (aliens) are ignorant of higher knowledge of simultaneous Higher Selves, or knowledgeable to some degree but lack comprehension when they attempt to interfere with us? Answer: Just as with us, the sequentials must progress at their pace, even if tediously slow. Just because they're aliens doesn't mean they've Advanced to know what I've been writing about. Just the opposite. How many Earthers know what I've been writing about? 509"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"Ms is unique and so is that compilation of knowledge in 3rd density. The aliens are trying to advance their agendas irregardless of higher knowledge or, in some cases, despite higher knowledge. Remember, they'll be trying to find the loopholes to their advantage in the Game up until and including the very last day of the Game. Simultaneous Higher Selves are permitted to override ANY event that will interfere with the plans that they have chosen for their incarnations at any incarnational level.

Question 414: In The Handbook for the New Paradigm, it states: \"Are you part of the problem by observing it or are you part of the solution by looking for the building blocks of what you want instead?\" This statement seems contrary to some things you have said. My question is more of a statement really to see if I understand the discrepancy. It is too late to foil Dark's plan. It is too well established. The best we can do is prepare to \"pass on\" the best way we can learn in the short time left. We can prepare by observing and learning The Game as much as possible. Answer: The Handbook, while containing many excellent comments, is not on the same level as Matrix 5. It is a good trilogy to read, especially at mid-Advanced levels. Learning comes in stages and if one can handle the Handbook, they have a better chance at handling the much more Advanced materials of Matrix 5. You have not understood what you are quoting. Just because they use the word \"observing\" does not mean they mean it the same as I do. This is a comprehension problem on your part. There is a major difference between observing the Game and developing spiritually. If you can't grasp it from what I’ve just said, you need a personal teacher to assist you on your level. Question 415: Does \"awakened\" refer to a person who is aware of The Game or, to take it a step further, is not only aware of The Game but also someone who has learned OBE and thus \"know\" there is life after life and everything that entails. Is one born a \"Final\" or does it depend upon what is learned in that incarnation? Answer: \"Awakened\", in my segments, means ONLY an Awakened Final Incarnation, and that is well handled in the materials. Again, if you cannot grasp it, you aren’t ready to understand it yet. The same goes for Final Incarnation. The book plainly states what is a Final and how a Final comes into being for a Higher Self. [Ed.- See also Q&A 431] Question 416: Am I wise assuming that learning OBE is the most powerful tool we can learn on 3rd density? I had told y.ou I was on my third read through M5 -1 realize I have a hard time being honest with myself. I admire your ability to see things as they are and not how they are presented. Answer: You are not \"wise\". Wisdom comes with much experience and learning. You misused that word too. You are also looking for conformity and a single path. You should deal with materials more at your level. If you can’t grasp topics in M5, just put them aside mentally. You are still assisting your Higher Self and your more Advanced incarnations. 510"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"Question 417: I saw a reference to a Jewish funeral on television in which it was stated that the custom was to cover up the mirrors while the mourners were around. Have you ever heard of this phenomenon? Answer: I asked a Jewish woman at work about the mirrors. She said it was so you didn't worry about what you look like, don't see your grief and don't risk seeing the spirit in the mirror. The key is you are supposed to suffer, she said, and orthodox also sit on something very uncomfortable to increase their suffering, such as a hard floor or rough, wooden box. Question 418: Interesting ... I wonder if she would know what the \"risk\" would be seeing 'the spirit' in the mirror? Since the reptilian mandate is throughly grounded in 3rd density life, it might be that this would be seen on levels all the way from 'distraction' to 'risk'. This mirror thing is interesting - instead of 'worrying about what others see', it encourages self­ censorship which parallels the wearing of the yarmulka ... which itself implies 'shielding' from the Higher Self at the crown, while amplifying other patterns by that other little box they wear on their heads over the frontal lobe ......... Answer: The small, black box worn on the front of the upper head signifies a blocking of the 3rd eye, similar to the yarmulka blocking the crown chakra. Hebrews are heavily into being cut off from their Higher Selves in order to serve external gods. No input from Higher Self, no 'true seeing' - that's the origin of these 2 items. Jews are so intimidated by their alien god that there are sects that don't even use the word 'god' but rather 'g..'.

Question 419: “I am very unhappy with my life and the constant alien abductions I have been having. I want to renegotiate the contract I made before incarnating.” Answer: You cannot \"renegotiate the contract\" as you stated here. First of all, there are NO 'contracts'. Whatever your incarnations experience is either desired or permitted by YOUR Higher Self, thus you. You are in your current situation because these are the experiences that YOUR Higher Self needs at this time. Question 420: This quote is scattered all over and I was hoping you would comment on it: “The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated. - Gandhi” Answer: The Gandhi quote you use below sounds nice, it is actually a sequential incarnation idea. Refer to my segment on the Hindu religion to get details. It's one thing to respect the animals, but another thing to be subservient to them. Food-based animals know well their purpose on Earth and the Planetary Spirit knows that as well. Cruelty, however, is another story and is unacceptable and also is reptilian. Question 421: In Matrix V, you comment on aliens at the Monroe Institute using technology, yet the appear to be astral in nature. Could you explain this further? 511"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge Internationa! Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Answer: The aliens have the technological ability to get slightly out of phase with the 3rd density using technology. This allows them to pass through walls when abducting, for example. They are also able to create astral counterparts of their physical technology and probe Earthers from that end as well. They can use their astral technology to work as their 3rd density technology does. They can also bring gains made via this method to the 3rd density. The significant note here is that they are depending on technology (external) instead of on themselves (internal). This is a sequential alien trait at the level of progression that they are at. There is a HUGE difference between dependence on astral technology and relying on yourself. Refer also to the segment on Astral Spacecraft new for this Gold Edition. If you cannot yet grasp' this, you have not reached the stage of Advancement necessary to grasp it. Hang in there. At some time in your incarnational progression you will! MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Question 422: What sort of \"relationship\" exists between each of the Higher Selves? What is the \"culture\" like in the \"space\" that these Higher Selves exist? Is this something that is explained in the Library on Level 27? Answer: You will discover the answers to your questions in time. You can find some answers to them in the Library on 27, but it really is something of concern more when you have completed the Game. I have no. comment on this at this time. Question 423: “ I wondered what you thought of Signs - with it's overt alien invasion by the reptilians and the reference to them harvesting us. It wasn't what I expected, but I was intrigued by how much info they revealed - the writer/director is obviously aware of the matrix V and other info. In the end it promotes the use of violence - which would not help our ascension efforts...” Answer: That you use the Lightsider word 'ascension' and are concerned about the use of violence, says you are not ready for all the info in M5 yet, since you are still a Lightsider, not a group who the book is written for. As for the main story thread in Signs, it is one of the things planned by the Orion Empire. The Gibson trauma is pure bullshit as no way would a reptilian stand there and allow those people to kill him. He would have killed all of them very quickly, but Earthers can't handle that. The real story of Signs is the aliens came, loaded their ships with human food and left to return when they feel it necessary for the next harvest. Question 424: “I read some information coming from Jelaila Starr from the Nibiruans (channeled, therefore suspect) about 4th, 5th and 9th dimensional (density?) grids having been placed around the earth to allow us to connect with them on whichever level we can so as to spiral out of here more easily. The inference was that there would be four parallel earths at these different levels, physically. Are there such grids in place? Since anything above 3rd density is non physical, (everyone seems to miss this, including this channel) I assume the only physical earth remaining would be the 3rd density one. Are we really headed for 9th density as a group, or does our connection as \"earthers\" end at 3rd density?” 512"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"Answer: You are reading alien-sponsored materials. Matrix 5 contains info on the difference between density and dimension. Everything above 3rd density is non-physical in a 3rd density context, but other density Earths (parallels do exist) and they are still in the 3rd density. Your last question can be deduced from the M5 materials quite easily. Matrix V Gold Edition has even more details. If you continue to be in a Lightsider mode and listen to alien propaganda, you will be continually sidetracked.

Question 425: Why does the Handbook for the New Paradigm, channeled and put out by George Green, propose the creation of ‘a new paradigm of experience on Earth’, if there really isn't anything anyone or any group can do to change or alter the system? Answer: The Handbook trilogy is geared to mid-Advanced levels. As to why the Handbook says anything , you'll have to ask the person who put it out. The Handbook trilogy will not be in the Matrix VGold Edition. Matrix 5 moved to a higher level. Question 426 :1 feel like the Game might be rigged. Could there be a slimmest of possiblity of a \"back door\" similar to a programmer who codes but utilizes a backdoor for easy entrance? And, if this backdoor exists, could it have, within the Game, people who seem to \"slip through\" the process of being noticed, long enough to obtain the power to cause change? Answer: You have to do what you feel you must, regardless of the Game. The rules of the Game were set before the Game started. They do not change after it started. We are in EndGame now for the simultaneously incarnating Higher Selves. BUT if you feel you must try to trick the rules, you are free to try and see what the consequences are for you. Remember, it's all experience! Question 427: Are the Final and Dominant incarnations chosen before the simultaneous incarnational cycle begins or is it a natural unfolding depending on the abilities of each incarnation to spiral out and overide the DNA and remember who we are? Answer: The Final Incarnation is an unfolding, as you say, and is slightly out of phase with the other incarnations due to how shim is composed since the 3-4 Dominant Incarnations decide how to form the Final. The Dominants are not pre-chosen incarnations. The incarnations reach that level by certain exceptional advances they make in their 'time'. For further information, consult with YOUR Higher Self. Question 428: 1 do have a specific question for you that I would be very interested in your response: It concerns the idea of us having the power to create our own reality according to our thoughts and beliefs. This is something that Hve spent a lot of time exploring and my experience has shown me to be true. Plus, it feels right. So, the question deals with subjective vs objective reality I suppose. The WAY IT IS that you write about may indeed be the real truth behind the collective reality. However, as divine oriented beings, do we not 513"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"still have the power to experience ANYTHING according to our deliberate intent?? Meaning, do we not have the unlimited power to CHOOSE our own beliefs and experience the corresponding reality? I believe we do. A bubble within the bubble? Without altering the overall game rules??? What is your take on that? Answer: You are not grasping a major theme in the Second Edition - The Game. If you understood the concept, you would not ask those questions about altering the Game. I'll let you consider this, if you are playing a board game in a tournament and, in the last stages of it you decide that you want to change the rules and thus alter the game you are playing (all pawns are now queens, for example). Do you think you would be allowed? No. Question 429: The reason I ask this is simply because, while I have absorbed your material, Ickes material and so much more in my quest to know THE TRUTH (and this all correlates and substantiates the big WHY this world is as fucked up as it s), Hve learned from hard experience that if I adopt a belief system based on (X), then Pm going to be experiencing that belief (X) as my reality. And I, as a free sentient being, wish to choose more pleasant experiences for myself. So why not' construct a belief system of our own choosing? So, what I x m getting at is this: On one hand is the THIS IS THE WAY IT IS perspective of the MatrixV materials. On the other hand is the WE LIVE IN STATE OF ABSOLUTE FREEDOM - SO FREE THAT WE CREATE (and experience) WHATEVER WE BELIEVE IN. In your opinion, Is there a balance of the two? Can you offer any perspective on this topic? Answer: As for David Icke (I really enjoy his material), he's a Lightsider. Lightsiders believe that they can alter the Game. This is a self-delusion and part of what he (they) need to learn at the stage they are in. You are also dealing with only the memories of your current incarnation until you are an Awakened Final and even then there are many limitations. You are playing into polarity fantasies both Dark and Light. This IS part of the Game and part of your experiential path. Yes, you can choose a belief but ALL beliefs are based on assumption, not fact. You can make choices all over and through making them you find out what is and what isn't AT YOUR OWN PACE. However you (the incarnation) do NOT have the power to alter the Game that you, your Higher Self agreed to before starting. The Lightsider belief concept of changing the rules of the Game is a fear based belief. While we are in the Game, we do NOT live in a state of \"absolute freedom\" as you suggest. That is a Lightsider new age religion beLIEf. Do/believe what YOU feel you must.

Question 430: With the progress and maturity I experience in this incarnation, is the growth I experience and the breakthroughs I have that help me spiral out part of a mutual sharing of information between all of my incarnations? In other words, the breakthroughs that I experience are a result of the shared learning of all my incarnations happening NOW. So as this incarnation progresses the experience is shared with other aspects of myself in the form of intiutive knowing and urges to pursue truth? So the more I progress in this incarnation the the more I progress in others(and vice-versa), therefore raising the level of understanding and maturity in all incarnations? So being a simultaneous experience means that the urge to grow and spiral out is simultaneously shared with other incarnations of myself who then pursue experience(knowingly or unknowingly) that help this incarnation in the form of intuitive knowing and breakthroughs of thought? I'm assuming that this shared experience is best utilized through the maturity of very advanced, dominant and final incarnation? 514"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"Answer: I’m glad you enjoy Matrix 5.

Question 431: Is the final incarnation chosen from the group of very advanced to dominant incarnations that has the best abitlity to be a Final or is the Final composed elsewhere through some other process that I have yet to become aware of? Answer: The 3 or 4 Dominant Incarnations decide on the Final Incarnation’s composition. The Final is composed of several important traits of the Dominant Incarnations. The appearance of the Final in the simultaneous path is slightly out of phase with the rest of the incarnations of that Higher Self due to the need for the Dominants to decide on the Final. Question 432: \"After considerable thought, I have come to the following conclusion. Waves of vibration make up existence. These waves are in essence THOUGHT (for lack of a better term) waves because existence is mental by nature. THAT is why permanence is an illusion and change is constant (waves do not rest, otherwise it would not be a wave). It is the same principle as waking and sleep states. When a person in third density is awake, they are operating primarily on alpha and sometimes higher frequency beta waves. When sleeping, there are primarily lower frequency theta waves, and in so-called ‘deep’ sleep there are even lower frequency delta waves. These theta and delta waves of vibration (electrical brain waves emanating from the ‘mind’) compose the reality created by the mind of the ‘sleeper’ when in the ‘dream’ state. The ‘creator’ in this case is the sleeping person. The experiences of the characters in the dream (astral realm) are very real and are carried ‘up’ into the subconscious and sometime consciousness of the ‘creator’ and upon awaking, the characters are drawn back into the mind of the creator (the person sleeping). The experiences of the dream characters actually become part of the creator because the creator truly feels every aspect of the experience as if the creator is the character (the characters are simply an extension of the creator). Third density so called reality is another dream state and the higher frequency waves/vibrations (similar principle to higher and lower frequency brain waves emanating from the ‘mind’) of the Higher Selves that chose to incarnate here slowed the vibration of that extension of themselves (the incarnation) to the point that the incarnation believes it IS separate and REAL. In actuality, just like when a person dreams, the EXPERIENCES are real and are carried back to the HIGHER SELF, but the characters end when the dream ends (death/waking up). The Higher Self ALSO eventually ‘wakes up’ and moves on to higher vibrations (new experiences). You are truly your own GOD as your Higher Self is the source of your existence here. However, your Higher Self is not THE SOURCE. THE Source cannot be defined or limited. The Higher Self eventually realizes/reconnects with its source which moves on to realization of its source, in constant movement toward new experiences and toward THE SOURCE which is not definable in words, it simply IS. There is a journey ahead that is infinite when defined in the mind of third density consciousness. It is important to note that the interconnectivity of the various states/rates of vibration are not as simple as a linear number line such as Higher Self vibration, to lower vibration incarnation, to dream state (although that is part of how it works, it’s not the ONLY way that things work) .......... instead there is an interconnected matrix of ‘portals’/nexus points between the various rates of vibration. Linear existence and movement is a third density concept. In actuality, even when in a lower vibration Delta 515"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"state (so called deep sleep dream experiences), one can move to awareness of the higher vibration Higher Self (faster vibration than the waking state physical body/consciousness) and in essence ‘skips’ over the third density dream ‘creator’ body. Various densities can be accessed by instantly traversing the densities via will, with or without apparent movement. These examples serve as an illustration of some of the basic principles on which the nature of existence rests. Is that basically accurate?\" Answer: Needs some tweaking, but basically correct.

Question 433: How did ancient earthers arrive on planet earth and who created them?. If you can't answer this question could you refer me to any literature out there which would help me? Answer: The ONLY other place I know of that you can find more information on Ancient Earthers is in the Library on Monroe level 27. I know of no one else who has written anything about them. If you can't access that, then it isn't necessary’for you to learn about this at this time. Curiousity is not a valid reason by itself. Question 434: There seems to be alot of talk of a planet called nibiru which passes into our solar system and carries a reptilian race called the annunaki. Is this story another one of the game tactics to deter higher self incarnation from knowing thier true self or this is really happening? Answer: Nibiru does exist as do (what they call) the annunaki. What is out about them is not all true, some on-purpose disinformation. As to what will happen in regard to them, time will tell. Question 435: Can you refer me to an authentic source for learning Shamanism? Answer: Nope. REAL shamans are unapproachable for apprenticeships. THEY must ask you to be their student and not the other way around. That is why there are so very few genuine shamans. There are pseudo-shamans who will teach pirated shamanic stuff, but it is the wrong way to learn and full of errors. Question 436: Hello, I'd first like to thank you and Val for putting together Matrx 5. Even though I'm nowhere close to being a Dominant or Final incarnation (probably low to mid Advanced), I've read your material 3 times in order to absorb as much as possible. Since I was a teenager I always had a feeling that there was something wrong with the way reality was being portrayed and found myself in a never ending \"search\" for real answers. Thanks to M5, I now see the world without blinders. It is however a very lonely path since there's absolutely nobody I know that could relate to this material. I look forward to your latest observations while at the same time sharpening my own observational skills. I do have a question regarding your most recent post (Feb 8th). You mention seeing a major with the Air National Guard with reptilian patches. I noticed that David Icke's site (under Headlines) has copied your info regarding this major. Is David aware of M5 and if so, why is he continuing with his Lightsider \"battle\" with the Dark forces? Answer: Thanks for your comments. I'm glad what I've written has been of use to you. As far as David, I do like him and have met him. His materials are excellent, but one has to 516"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"keep in mind where he is - mid-Advanced level. He is aware of M5 but is not ready for it. Remember, every path is unique and David's incarnation is experiencing what his Higher Self wants at this time and that is as a Lightsider at war with the Dark. Nevertheless, strip away his Lightsider commentary and you have a lot of valuable info. One flaw in his material is that David is hung up on astral reptilians and thinks they are the only influence. He has blinders on in regard to the 3rd density aliens. He must proceed at his own pace and according to his path. Take what you find useful from what he writes and discard the rest. Don't look for conformity...take satisfaction in the difference. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Question 437: I'm unclear about the way one incarnation \"bleeds through\" and affects /influences another that's occurring simultaneously. For instance, how am I or other incarnations of mine influenced by the vibrations of mine from Ancient Greece and other periods? Also, how does my reading M5 in this time around the block impact my other (and final) incarnations? Especially if my higher self already knows the rules of the game prior to agreeing to play, how does one incarnation's learning it impact another's if this information is centrally stored within the HS anyway? (Or am I mistaken on this?) Answer: This is a bit tricky to explain and something you may do better to put aside for now. There are several segments in M5 that cannot be deeper explained but you WILL gain the proper understanding with a more Advanced incarnation. Reading M5 in this incarnation permits subtle vibrations and keys to be transmitted to incarnations in other time periods. Your Higher Self does know the rules, but all the rules cannot be explained within the Game. This is why I continually stress trusting in YOUR Higher Self above all. It has to do with M5 being made manifest IN the Game and during EndGame, but not before. You are attempting to simplify a very complex set of issues dealing with the Game. Your Final Incarnation, when Awakened, will have access to the answers to these questions. I can't explain it more fully than that. Remember that it is primarily for Final and Dominant incarnations that M5 was written. Other incarnations will have to do with what they can glean from it. Question 438: I'm also curious about the progression of the incarnations through the polarities on the way to balance, and want to know more about the path of how the incarnations experience both dark and light alternately (and how the ratio of both sides in each will vary) until neutrality is found. Answer: They do. What you ask would involve a whole other book or a personal teacher who has the time/desire to teach you. Each Higher Self does experience both polarities and blends them together to eventually form a yin-yang style balance then achieving Balance during the Awakened Final Incarnation. Each Higher Selfs plan is unique, so there is NO standard for this. Consult YOUR Higher Self. If you are to have more information on this topic, you will. Question 439: Can I assist this incarnation(a child growing up) with the blocks which the orion empire has placed to prevent one from knowing their true self? Answer: Everything depends on the path chosen by each Higher Self for each incarnation. If the incarnation is Low or Mid levels, all you can do is set examples and whatever happens, happens. Anything more than setting examples and you are guilty of trying to force a situation rather than allow individual expression. 517"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

Consciousness and Experiential Environmental Gradients Beginning at 3rd Density Earth Existence Through 8th Density Most people who have even touched on the subject of consciousness studies recognize that there are different states of consciousness that one experiences, for instance, as one falls asleep. There is, of course, that famous point between waking and sleep where the body goes to sleep, often with detectable paralysis, while the mind and attention remain fully awake. What is usually discussed is the progression from alpha waves through delta waves of deep sleep, but there is more to this process than meets the eye. According to the understanding provided by Robert Monroe, as the signals from the physical senses fade out while the person remains awake, there is actually a movement of consciousness where one eventually begins to perceive series of whole new environments and experiences. Monroe created an arbitrary series of numbers to measure the movement into the densities, which he called “focus levels”, matching distinct perceptual frontiers that appear as awareness moves into this field with an ever-increasing numerical equivalent, creating an initial system to measure the degree of “phase shifting”. continues up .... Beings, Consciousness and Experiential Patterns 49 8th Density The Higher Selves on 5 th density have \"nodes\" on the 8th density, into which the Higher Self migrates (from the 5 th), as the Final Incarnation becomes the Higher Self, and all 3 rd density incarnations are brought in to allow the move upward. Beings, Consciousness and Experiential Patterns 43-48 7th Density Beings, Consciousness and Experiential Patterns 36-42 6th Density 35 The Higher Selves that currently conduct simultaneous incarnations on Earth have their position here in the 5 th density, with energy projections around and below it to gather knowledge, wisdom, understanding and experience of basic issues in identity, polarity and other dynamics. 29-35 5th Density 28 Focus 28 is an astral \"bridge\" zone, a buffer area. Experience from here on takes on a wondrous character, beyond anything you have experienced on 3 rd density. Focus 29 is where 5 th density roughly begins, with advanced non-physical levels extending to Focus 34 , where a great collection of Higher Selves experiencing Earth incarnations exist, moving into Focus 35 . Once a Higher Self decides that it has had enough of Earth incarnations, all the incarnations will be \"drawn in\" and the Higher Self moves further out into the field, up into the 7 th or 8th density, where it will typically send out more \"probes\" of awareness to experience things on these levels. There appear to be several main \"nodes\" of the Higher Self, the lowest density one sits on the 5 th, around Monroe focus level 34 / 35 , at this time for most beings having 3 rd density incarnational experience.

This level has been called \"The Park\", where vou can visit the library (containing every work ever created on Earth, which of course includes this book) and virtually all knowledge, even about things not regarding Earth. There are also places for life review, healing centers, classes and all sorts of activities.

Review of other incarnations, lessons learned, etc. 26 Focus 26 is the last area within the band Belief System Realities, and contains what Monroe referred to as the \"Religious Terminus\", where religious groups, people of every ironclad Earth belief system, congregate until they realize there is more beyond where they are. There is even a temple of Zeus, with some people having even chosen to appear like \"jesus\" and every other religious figure in order to play with, control or manipulate the \"ex-humans\" who haven't progressed. There are people here, flush with the new-found power of personal reality manipulation, who see themselves as \"god\" and even go so far as demanding to be worshipped!

It is also at Focus 21 where it becomes apparent that movement from \"place\" to \"place\" is a function of will, and that your real intention is a key to where you will end up, Instantaneously, Experiences are stripped of matter, space and time constraints.

After one has been to Focus 12 enough times, the external sound patterns are no longer necessary. According to Monroe, on Focus 12 lies the \"gateway\" to the Higher Self, among other things. A part of what one experiences in Focus 12 , at least in the early stages, are movement of patterns and colors, and geometrical shapes.

Some Comments on the Material from Readers 2 r - d Edition Comments to 2/14/03 \"I am having a blast being involved with the M5 project. It gets me off seeing all the observations and comments. I enjoy watching all the different levels of incarnations advancing. It is really true what you say to just enjoy your incarnation. I have had the opportunity to give several Ms's to higher self incarnations exposed to me. It's amazing watching their lights turn on exposed to the information. I am having a great time, thanks for keeping it rolling as long as possible. I like the way the website keeps advancing. The truth really gets me high is the best way I can explain it.\" \"Just want to thank you for the wonderful information in Matrix V. I almost didn't read it. I have a female body in this incarnation and after reading a few pages, threw the book down, thinking that I didn't need information from a ‘female hating male’. \"Something\" made me pick it up again and read it carefully. Matrix V explains so much for me. I understand why I never desired to marry or bear children, I understand the presence of the 3 entities that I have recurring dreams about, I understand why I have always intuitively chosen gold light, even when instructed in guided meditation to use white light. There is much I do not understand, but am confident it will unfold at the correct moment. I still continue some of my light side activities; participating in weekly peace vigils, publishing a peace newsletter, etc. but no longer feel compelled to convince anyone of my position. It’s more like I'm putting out information and people can do with it what they will. I have ordered the book you recommended on astral projection (have only projected while asleep) and use your very powerful meditation technique. It's a reversal of my former practice when I started with the base chakra and went up. Your's works better for me. Thank you. By the way, I love the \"sum of\" symbol you use in Matrix V. It says it all. I will continue to check your site for updates and will order the gold edition in March. Please know that I do NOT consider any of the material to be \"female hating\" at this point. That was my initial reaction, long since revised.\" \" To read Matrix V and to understand it in its entirety life is irrevocably changed. The mindset switches to a new plateau and viewing life as it truly is here on 3rd density with all that this entails - Matrix V is a one way ticket to this! What I have found is that my perceptions have been honed, the inner voice, coincidence, and when I focus on questions, they are answered; your inner voice never lies! To be honest the spin offs have been awesome! And this is inherent in each and every one of us living simultaneous lives. To know that there is no such thing as death is liberating, and at a stroke, fear of this is eliminated!\" \"I've read your material 3 times in order to absorb as much as possible. Since I was a teenager I always had a feeling that there was something wrong with the way reality was being portrayed and found myself in a never ending \"search\" for real answers. Thanks to Ms, I now see the world without blinders. It is however a very lonely path since there's absolutely nobody I know that could relate to this material. I look forward to your latest observations while at the same time sharpening my own observational skills.\" \"I would like to personally thank you, because through your book, I found Monroe books.

I have been through the book several times and I find each time brings me to a deeper understanding of who I am and what I'm experiencing. As this has happened I have noticed those around me start to recede. I have always known that my search for truth would need to be addressed and only in the last five years has it become very intense. Matrix V has provided me the keys to clarify what has always been intuitively known by me but told to ignore by most of those around me.” \"Since the time I began to read the Matrix V materials online, my life has gone from mid- turbulent to MEGA-turbulent. Relationships have been demolished. Illusions have shattered. Dreams have blown up in my face, and through no conscious choice on my part, I find myself feeling a greater disconnection with many people. My world has changed drastically. My opinions of many things have shifted, flip-flopped and the opinions of others towards me has also shifted, as they witness that I am not playing the same game as they play. My relief has been through simplifying my life as much as is practically possible, and through a continual focus on my inner voyage, and tuning into my inner space, which is another way of saying my Higher Self. As increasingly, that is the only place I get any comfort. Certainly don't get it externally. I have realized some kind of progress: While I J m aware of the judgment of others, it doesn x t bother me so much what they may think about me. Not too long ago, it would bother me HUGELY if someone didn x t approve of me. I DID go through a period when I suffered at not being understood by those that claim they love me. Now, I say, So be it. DoesnH matter. Who cares! I J m orchestrating my own play now. And choosing the parts I want them to play. And the truth is, they cannot possibly comprehend what these changes in me are or why. And thaPs ok. They don x t need to. They are in their own play. Its your material that has helped me gain this perspective. So, thanks.\" “I have been reading the materials that you post for a wile now, but it all “pales” to the amazing knowledge contained in Matrixs. I cannot ind the appropriate words to thank you for this revelation. Now, I can understand the comments made on the website about Matrixs - it’s really an “eye opener”. “Since I have started to read Matrix 5 I have been analysing much of my previous choices in life, Why did 1 have chose one particular road instead of another, why I have all this curiosity, why did I always “feel” marriage is not for me and so on. I can now understand that this was my HIGHER SELF trying to awaken me to the real true of what I really am. I now, more than ever, have a great desire to contact with my HIGHER SELF, meaning ME, and can,t thank you enough. This material is so advanced that I don’t know when would be possible for me to have contact with something like this, if it wasn’t for your sharing, I was not a very psychic person, but since the year 2000 I have had a continual interest in all material dwelling with the spirit. I have never had an OBE but I’m determined to do what ever is necessary so I can (if that is what my HIGHER SELF wants me to do), get in contact with the real ME, and be able to explore and travel in to grater realities.

Reading the book the first time completely took my breath away, at the same time I felt an exhilaration that I have never felt before in my life. As I read page after page it was like a key unlocking doors in my mind. To me personally each piece of information gleaned felt somewhat familiar, I sensed recognition from within which was profound. This material is so life changing. To find information such as this that is so thought provoking, it is easy to look to the Author of the information as a guru, is this not what we as humans are programmed on 3rd density to do, to look outwith ourselves for masters who pertain to have all the answers? And by doing this, giving our power away to another! What is and has been important is following a road, listening to my inner self which has brought me to the MV materials. Had I not for the last twenty years or so followed a road that has had many twists, turns and dead ends which has resulted on an ongoing learning experience, then I would not in truth have been ready for nor understood Matrix V. I initially opened the first page of Matrix V without being overly dramatic. My life has been turned upside/down - inside/out. It has been an ongoing learning experience, which shows no signs of slowing down. To participate in a belief and experiencing it for myself by looking within has shown me what is real and true and what is not; because of this it is easy to be an observer of life here on 3rd density. To become aware and resonate with the information within Matrix V is power, which releases forever the invisible shackles that have imprisoned us since birth on 3rd density. Margaret” “In the very far past, I would have been concerned, but now I read between the lines. Whatever happens happens as a lesson. I’ve been in touch with my Higher Self to the point where I've always found what I need, remarkably.” James \"Last night after reading the M5 meditation for crown chakra connection I focused on my 18 x 24 Higher Self poster. When I layed down to sleep I visualized the ball of the stream coming down to my crown when I said CONNECT. I felt the surge all the way down to my heart chakra! This was the first time.\" \"Thank you so much for the information you have brought forward. 1 have read many books, like Monroe's which are wonderful, but Matrix V, which I've read two and a half times, explains to me why I have never fit in with other females and their groups, could never understand what the hell they were talking about when plotting about guys/men, and had thoughts and feelings I could never share with any of them. Never say never, but that's what fits here. I underwent a transition 6 years ago and am not attracted to anybody physically (lots more to this). My best friend now is a gay male, but not like most gays, and it is your material that helped him realize this. Our paths have crossed for 30 years, but most profoundly in the last 12 in which we have been waking up rapidly (lots of amazing and escalated life as well as \"spiritual\" experiences). We can, as he puts it, communicate and share \"across the gap\". He is quite psychic and gifted, and when we talk he sometimes reminds me of you. None of this of course is a coincidence. I am just very grateful for my increased and better understood connection to my Higher Self (got rid of the religious interpretation), for my friend, and for you, Val, and your on-going material.

A great transformation is taking place in my life and I have started to see the world entirely different from a few months ago. I view the game from a higher perspective, now, with the knowledge I have digested \"Dammit, I never expected any of this to actually work. Since starting to read the read the book, however, things have taken a marked directional shift from where they once were. I find myself torn between two strong emotions - one, incredible sadness (nostalgia for the days of ignorance and bliss - almost as Cypher in the Matrix) at the life and times I've got to leave behind, and two, an incredible amazing excitement and possibilities within this time machine in which I now reside and within the world which carries this weary traveler to whatever destination he so desperately seeks. Your writings have actually done what they claimed capable of and rubbed more of the sleep from these weary eyes. Your mission has been accomplished at the very least in this lone individual.\" \"Since reading Matrixs and the Monroe trilogy, I have had some amazing things happen. I had previously written about using the advice of the Author on connecting with my Higher Self and what had happened. This seems to be just the beginning. Now that I have taken that first step towards a more expanded awareness, I have had more intense experiences. What I find even more interesting is that I have ALWAYS been doing this and having these experiences since childhood but because I was \"taught\" by the Game to focus my attention outward, I forgot about so many of the things I KNEW as a child (the DNA kicking in didn't help either!). Since having my new expanded viewpoint, I reread Matrixs and it's ALL there. The more I expand mv awareness, the more I will see in the book. My struggle now seems to be internal. The body is trying to fight for control and I can feel this incarnation is demanding that I identify with it. I sense that it knows it is fighting a losing battle but despite all this I do not view my incarnation as my enemy. To hate this body and feel anger at the Game is only going to add more baggage that I am going to have to let go of eventually. It's all about turning INWARD and TRUSTING yourself and KNOWING that you are MUCH more than your physical body. I knew this as a child (before the Game got its hooks in me) and some of you out there knew it too. It’s simply a matter of remembering what you forgot.\" \"I ordered Ms on some impulse and I am about 50% through it. It showed up at a curious time in my life because a few months ago I moved out on a woman I was about to marry. The relationship just wasn't working, and everything you write in M5 rings true for me. M5 makes so much sense because it is the only material I have ever encountered that could really resonate with my experiences.\" \"It took me a long time to digest the material contained within M5 and I did initially hold a lot of reservations, but as of late I have had experiences which have led me not only to believe but to KNOW. For instance a week ago I got a small bundle of info from my Higher Self telling me this 3rd density reality truly IS a game by the very definition of the word . I don't claim to be a Dominant or a Final (at least not until I know any better) but nonetheless all my fears concerning the future of my existence evaporated in an instant and I kept laughing 'til the next day - the truth really does set you free. I now have a burning desire to know more and to explore the many regions of myself I haven't vet been acquainted with. \"Something very interesting happened to me a few hours ago and I thought I would share it with the group.

Instead of giving in to this urge, I thought about trying something. I used the advice given by the author on connecting to my Higher Self and I felt the sexual energy surge upward through my body. I then visualized a cord running up from my head to my Higher Self (like on the cover of Matrixs). What happened next is something that I can't really put into words. My perspective changed and I had the impression of being surrounded by multicolored lights. I also understood that everything I was experiencing in this incarnation was being processed and sent down to other incarnations and that I was also receiving info from the other incarnations as well. All this sharing was happening at once because all the incarnations were the \"same\". I felt the impression of a \"previous life\" in 17th century France. I also felt that one of my goals in THIS incarnation is to experience Endgame. All of this happened in only a matter of minutes. I had read about this in Matrixs but to experience it is quite a different thing. What I have described isn't even everything that happened because it's so difficult to find words for what I felt. One of the things that got to me was how crystal clear EVERYTHING was. I'm going to keep pursuing this.\" \"I want to share an experience I had 2 weeks ago...since this topic of ascended masters has come up, I think it is relevant. I was invited to a 'musical evening' by an old friend and since I enjoy music and singing, I accepted. I was aware that she was a part of this group who believes in as. masters but did not know that the musical evening was solely so called 'ascended master' songs and meditation. Anyway, I decided to sit through the one hour programme. As soon as they started out their 'love and light' meditation, I was amazed to find that there were a whole bunch of dark entities who converged onto the location...some were openly mocking, some were actually 'feeding' off the energy they created. (I am a Reiki teacher and can see auras and am very sensitive to this kind of thing.) I threw up gold shields around the location and within a few minutes at most, they wandered off as if they could not sense the energy any more. It brought to mind what you had said in Matrix 5: using white light attracts the dark. Very strongly it did.\" \"Reading Matrix 5 has cleared up some major issues I have faced while in this incarnation. I have had several bisexual and homosexual experiences in the past few years. During this same time period I have had a furious interest in occult and metaphysical teachings that seemed to start a few years before my experiences into different aspects of my sexuality. Before reading Matrix 5 I never knew how to deal with this because I did not understand how to feel about this. I have dealt with a lot of grief and guilt because I did not know why I was the way that I was. Now I know that these aspects of myself are the benchmarks of a advancing spirit and that I don't have to feel ashamed about anything. I know now that all I need to do is drop the labels that people have placed upon me and reach towards the inner me my higher self. I can see that there is nothing wrong with me but rather it is the game that is improper to a advancing spirit. I am also very curious to find out the level of incarnation that I am currently at in this life.\" \"I have always considered books my best friend and guide.

I agree entirely about what you say on genders.

I myself was in one het relationship from '82-'86 (shim had clearly told me that it was better NOT to marry... I ignored the message) and then had to walk away - as my spiritual growth was hindered terribly by the friction. I learned the lesson of allowing another their path, not interfering or trying to ’change' or control. I just did w'hat I had to at the time without the knowledge I have now, and it was not easy but after reading MV, I realise that my HS needed to overcome the programming and it was done this way ..after that I have not been in any relationship...never found anyone with whom I could move forward. It has definitely been a rough ride but I am glad for it. Would not have had it any other way. I agree totally about the female control too and the posturing and manipulation. It is good to know why these things are in place, but once this information is filed aw'ay, the most important thing to do is to get on with our progress and overcome the blocks, the very first 70-odd pages of MV have given me clarity on this issue and I look forward to completing my first reading for more inputs, known and new.

I knew of its existence for a while, but finally, one day, I just knew it was time to get the M5 material into my hands. I've used the Hemisync music for a while, and have had some very seriously profound experiences while in the heightened state it produces. I’ve had unusual experiences since childhood, and this work has put so much into a greater perspective for me. Thank you so much! All 3 of the Monroe books are on the way, and I can hardly wait to begin reading them. Thanks again for publishing this amazing work. It has had an incredible impact!\" \"I wanted to express my appreciation for your work set forth in Matrix 5. Having received it about a week ago, I'm on my second read-through (except the Handbook which I read a few months back - a very slow read). Wonderful, insightful and your Q&A. sessions are very revealing, both in the questions and how you handle them. The last few years I've been on a search for these materials and in the process have learned a great deal of the background on issues you mentioned in M5. In fact, somehow I knew to first digest some of Val's other matrix books and materials before M5. \"Waking up in time\" is the refrain that goes through my mind. The implications of the insights in M5 are profound and will take me time to assimilate. But I know one thing for sure - this will be a year of major change in my life as a result. Already many decisions are made and it remains but to implement them. I have ordered Monroe’s three books and Icke's Greatest Secret and need to assimilate these as well. I've not been into astral travel before but am now very interested in learning, and will do so. There is no substitute for knowingness resulting from direct experience, rather than belief and opinion.\" \"First of all, thank you for writing Matrix V. It is impacting my life daily and I am on my second read through, and, of course, I am picking up things that did not resonate the first read through. I feel as though I understand the \"rules\" of the universe now, where as before it was a hodgepodge of stuff 1 had read over the years in which I was never able to put \"it\" together. All I can say is that I feel centered about the information I have read in Matrix V.\" Nancy \" M5 IS a great aid.

After turning 40, my life took on a major rapid change (now 49). I left the church of many years, my daughter went off to college and independent. Divorced (remain good friends) got rid of all the material baggage. All this was prompted by several (OBE) experiences non-induced. I learned the usage of the word NO and really like the way I felt after using it bold and strong. In this new found freedom I became a loner by choice and got quiet and went on an inside search. Then I began hearing this voice speak to me telling me things that were so bizarre to my intellect pictures, flashes and, sounds I had never heard. The cover of M5 was one of the pictures I saw two years ago. I even drew the same picture except my people look liked little oval balls dangling from the cord. I didn’t come here this time to be an artist. Anyway, synchronicities began to happen one right after another and now it’s just my normal way of life.

That’s just what happened when I stumbled on Trufax.org. I saw the picture of M5 I knew that I knew that I knew this was going to be the catalyst of completion of the blurry things I needed clarity on. (After all I saw the picture two-years prior.)

I am having a good time living the four laws and truly having a grand laugh at the media, and the mass. I am not hung up on an image, name, body, labels, friends, family, and lonely... what’s that about? Do what you did when you were a kid’s... talk to yourself!

I know this from the date on the hard copies I've printed of the entire material. I couldn’t afford the risk of it being gone the next day. I instantly knew that this kind of passion, the complex overtones and the hard core honesty of the Q&A interactions were beyond anyone’s ability to fake. Besides, almost all the concepts in the material had been previously validated by my own life experience, all but one: I've never seen an alien personally, although I have encountered (OOBE) some kind of probing/monitoring device, slightly out of phase with the physical. (I have a feeling these are all over the place). However , this is not the reason I'm writing this message. In my first message to this group, I wrote that when I first saw the M5 cover art, I became dizzy and my heart started to beat rapidly. I recognized it !!! It turns out that between the years 1993-1996 I’ve had two direct interactions inside my Higher Self. I just didn't use that name. I called shim my \"Headquarters\" or my \"White Room With The Tower\".

'contacts' occurred at two very critical points in my life. They came with no preparation, absolutely no planning, training or intention. They just happened. The only possible trigger was the fact that at that time I was feeling very scared, very heartbroken, very disoriented and VERY ALONE. Strange things had started to happen to me, like spontaneous Out of Body experiences, powerful dreams, countless synchronicities, and much more. The state of mind I was in at that time was something like: If I die this very moment, so be it. For a short period after the second contact, I even believed that I had actually died. This was far ago and long away, and I have \"changed\" A LOT since then. I would like to describe two aspects of those interactions. Of course, there is so much more, but that's another story for another time. First, the visuals were almost identical to the M5 cover (the colors, the texture, the energy pillar etc.) There were two exceptions: l.I didn't see the energy connection in my upper HS, and 2 .1 didn't see \"heads\", only shadowy, humanoid appearing silhouettes, of which two were more prominent. Secondly, I wasn't told anything about incarnational levels, dominant, final or otherwise. Of course, I didn't know those existed (at that time), and I had totally different questions in my mind. Those were clearly answered. I will gladly share more about these contacts with anyone having a point of reference for this specific type of interaction. None of the people I know have such a point of reference. Those two 'events' were followed by dramatic changes of course in my current incarnation. Many of those changes I have later read about( with tears in my eyes) in the M5 material. To sum it all up: When I saw the picture on the book cover, I KNEW, maybe for the first time in my life, that I was not alone. Happy new year, everyone.\" \"Several years ago, in December, I found the Leading Edge Website and ordered and read the first four Matrix Books. I also got several books about the Montauk Experiments, which I found fascinating at that time. Now, thanks to Val, the author and Matrix V, I am armed with further knowledge about the game and it’s players and about the reality of my Higher Self. This is the greatest gift I could ever be given.\" Sue \"Since coming into contact with Matrix V six months ago, the transformation within me is absolute. Because of this I feel as though I am living on 3rd density on two levels. I realize that I am here in this physical body to fulfill specific experiences in this incarnation. Finding out the truth about where we come from, why we are here, and where we return to after we leave here is priceless information. EACH WAKING DAY, I REVEL IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE ACQUIRED IN Matrix V Now that I view 3rd density without the box, the manipulation, deceit and all of it are plain to see. Yet in spite of this knowledge, I realize that as much as I would like to leave this place, this incarnation, I know that I have to fulfill my assignment here - so to speak! If life ends in the next breath or lasts however long, it is of no consequence. So now I find myself outwardly still functioning as before, inwardly I am still me of course, yet the change! (There are no words capable of describing it properly!) there is a 'knowing' Observing everything with a changed mindset and perspective is a world away from where I was six months ago Together with this, the most important change for me is my success in astral projection, which I have found with practice and dedication was my next logical step to take. To the Author I would like to say. What you have done for me in providing me with the information to help myself is invaluable. For years I have struggled along a road with many twists and turns in my search for truth. The information and advice that you and Val give on this forum is invaluable.

The number of whiners, immature (for the M5 level) and pontificating people who have slithered into this Group, and booted out when they are identified by their own hand, is significant. Their demanding, victim/victimizing incarnations are easily manipulated by the Game and Game DNA commands. While this is their stage and they MUST be allowed to progress at THEIR pace, they continually try to attempt to throw road blocks with belief (but totally false information). These are attempts to drag others down to their level or, at least, keep you from Advancing. What they don't get is that when you have reached VERY Advanced levels and Final, you don’t fall for these tricks that low thru mid-Advanced levels will believe. That's one of the reasons why it takes HUNDREDS of incarnations to reach Final. The Laws of Allowance are lived, not just understood, by the Very Advanced levels along with their implications. \"In the months that have followed my connecting with Matrix V, and really absorbing the impact of the work, I have had many definite phases of development. I don’t hold Matrix Five as a bible but I do hold it with reverence. The truth stands up and stands out now. I can spot my old patterns a mile away. What a gift. People continue to drift out of my life, I am pretty much just watching it. The new clients who come in ( out of the woodwork I am so busy as of late) are all interesting and I seem to be acting a catalyst in their lives. 1 just hang out and do my thing and things pop out of my mouth that surprise even me. This leads to huge shifts in them and when I see them the next week they are breaking up with lovers, losing jobs, distancing from family the whole gamut. This all seems to be accelerating and I am sitting back and watching. Meanwhile my focus remains the same. I am all about connecting fully with my higher self and having a good time with it. No agendas to speak of. Just clearing out the closets and watching the show.\" \"Ever since I read this material a year and a half ago on Trufax.org, my life has changed dramatically. What is contained in Matrix V is THE most compelling exercise in critical thinking I have ever come across. I suspect some people who see this material, including myself at times, think that the Author is criticizing certain behaviour, and people get offended by that. He is just sharing his experience, and it seems to me that the Matrix V material is more about questioning one's own behaviour and self rather than comparing it to what the Author has experienced and what works for him. I haven't found anything else quite as interesting as Matrix V, and I have made the mistake of turning it into a 'box', making Matrix V parameters and standards to compare myself to. The real gift I have learned from reading Matrix V is how to experience my own path without letting others run it for me (including Matrix V!). I have to say, a lot of what I have read in Matrix V are things I have always suspected (women for instance, never worked for me once my body got satisfied by them, and I could never quite pinpoint why). Many of those things however, I did not have the courage to deny and oppose, b/c I was afraid of others opinions. Matrix V for me, has helped me learn to think independently, more so than I already did, and in a completely new direction. My higher self brought me the answers to questions 1 had, and some I didn't even know about! Even in the midst of what appears to be the utter stupidity and pettiness of myself and the human race, I am now seeing more and more the beautiful cosmic gears turning in perfect balance and harmony. Knowing everything will always work out exactly as it should and with perfect timing, how could I ever worry about or fear anything?\" \"I want to share a perspective I have after reading Matrix V : I have discovered that I have a bad case of the \"I'm sorries\".

Just saying I’m sorry and feeling self-pity is victim consciousness, and robs myself of the ability to do anything about a situation, not to mention being a distortion of the lesson I had been a part of. Making more constructive decisions in the future, and then experiencing them through to their consequences is the only way I am going to learn.\" \"Coming from different parts of the world from all walks of life, viewing and living life from differing perspectives, due to the circumstances into which we were born, yet all having one thing in common 'that need to know what our lives are all about' we, who in spite of the particular situations we have found ourselves in, have somehow been drawn to Matrix V this in my opinion is no coincidence. To be in possession of the knowledge within Matrix V empowers one to observe life on 3rd density without the box. With the realization that life within the box is controlled from cradle to grave without this being perceived in general by the 3rd density population. When you think about it, we are born into a body which is needed for the experience of life here, everything that we amass during our incarnation our homes, money etc., can’t be taken with us when we leave, only our experiences, which is the sole reason for being here. Unfortunately for the masses that cling strongly to body ID believing the lies that they are fed throughout their lives there is no freedom of choice, as they are consistently mentally and physically body focused. For those who have listened and trusted their inner voice, this has taken those on the road to enlightenment. To live in this specific time slot is very special because I feel that we are coming to a complete metamorphosis of reality and consciousness on 3rd density the like of which has never been seen before.\" \"It is nice to find this forum on the Leading Edge Research Group web page. Came highly recommended. Actually, the material found me right on schedule; considering the synchronistic flow of late. (For me )shim's spiral out continues to accelerate (almost exponentially), and that which is needed is being successfully presented. Accordingly, resonation with Matrix V is quite intense, thanks for the words. Historically, words have fallen way short on the 'who am I, what am I doing here' trail. Reprogramming one's 'vision' for truth is tough in today's society, especially with the constant bombardment of useless, disconnected terms and concepts (\"education\") projected during the most receptive stages. That which does hold truth for the Earther's eager spiritual growth, lay cloaked in compartmentalized form, scattered and dissolute to logical understanding.\" \" The release of this material and much other related info has substantially improved my connectedness and brought me to new meanings and understandings of 'life'. Of course this ongoing process of having all of this material sink in and continue to reveal far more than my mere imagination could or would have ever dreamed up is especially rewarding to me (and I would assume for most people on this list as well). So all of the alienation / loneliness / isolation / sense of being different etc. are now understood as welcome and necessary experiences and have become tools on my palate of life's variety. That I AM has become far more important than Where I am. Like the saying goes, 'It's not so important what happens, as what the reaction / response to it is'.\" \"Matrix V opened my eyes; giving me the ultimate knowledge about 'life on 3rd density' and because of this life has taken on a whole new meaning.

Loneliness, after spiraling out with the info in Matrix V, is one of the rocks near the END of the rocky road. Since you accept leaving the Game, you've overcome most of the rocks. Now it's time to test your dedication to what you've now learned. Can you incorporate what is given (that you need/want) into your life? If it's only an intellectual thing, you have far to go, but will go that way either later on or in another incarnation. The Author, Nov 2001) \"There were two big things that came into my life as a result of Matrix V - loneliness, and responsibility. Loneliness (although I have plenty of 'people' around) is not new to me, (or, I would guess, to most of the people on this forum) but this is a different kind of loneliness in that 'meaningful' conversations with everyday people becomes tedious and 'meaning-less', (unless humor can be brought into it! - I find the two extremes very satisfying - either a conversation in which something new can be learned or given, or just a bloody good laugh just for laughter’s sake - I would rather peel my eyeballs than engage in small-talk). I often sit and marvel at the genius of the 'game' when listening to intelligent, articulate and philosophically astute friends opine their theories with well-rehearsed ardor (if I can stand it that long)- to the point of mesmerizing their close audience - BECAUSE it is blindingly obvious they simply do not ’get it’ - the blinkers are too high and wide and dense. And what is even more fascinating is how their audience is readily ’taken in' by it. A few grand gestures and a well-placed 'I think...' or 'I believe....' and the audience is hooked. Matrix V says a great deal about the 'beliefs' and the belief-system territories give an excellent example of this human folly. This is the lonely part - but can be fascinating. The responsibility part comes with not only how one handles the information; but also, how one uses the information. Human (3D) nature being what it is, many people would have hidden agendas or motivations for either being involved with the Matrix V information, or for using it to satisfy their egos (hence the body-id based “longing to be a Final Incarnation” - and then let everyone know about it). Also, as The Author stated many times about 'pushing the information to one side if it's too much', many people cannot take the responsibility to themselves to admit that some new information or other is too much at that time (hence we had our synchronous journeys to this information which came along when ready) and in personal conversations with people when this material is brought to the surface, it is easier for the listener to dismiss your information outright if they can't handle it, than to just put the book to one side. The human contact thing really upsets some people whereas the book is a lot less intimidating. I'm aware that I'm beginning to ramble now, but I just wanted to think but loud and share some thoughts with you all. So, on a last note (and trying to stick to the title of this thread) I wouldn't say that there's a Challenge 'beyond' Matrix V as such, as I think the information is part of us on many levels and therefore gets to evolve and grow M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition 534"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"as we do - and WITH us. It's not like we can read the book a few times and put it down and say ' ok I've learnt that lot, what's next?). \"It was my experience before reading Matrix V that I would be subjected to the same alienation, loneliness and general disassociation that I have experienced during my reading of the material. The real divergence in experience for me, has been that now I more fully understand why. This has made all of the difference. I had read a few light-sided texts and channels on my path to Matrix V and felt even more the outsider. I would find bright and promising friends who knew that something was amiss here on Earth. Slowly I would watch as they would then proceed to construct a whole new set of boxes to fit themselves in. Subsequently they would fall out of my life and I would be alone again. Each time having their judgment that I was \"Dark\" linger. I had to be dark because I wasn't buying into the new set of dogma ... Also there are the unfolding gifts of consciousness that I didn't have before Matrix V and have really tapped into. It is a blast sharpening these skills and allowing others to surface. Almost like the Christmas morning Gestalt . A mixed anticipation and glee of the unknown yet certain to be pleasant experiences awaiting \"All or most of us who have found Matrix V have traveled many roads, with each road new experiences taking us further from what we have been brought up to believe as normal. The further that we have traveled the lonelier it becomes because we find ourselves out of sync with society in this world. When you think how many people are on this planet, with all the different belief systems, no matter where you go there is control. So is it any wonder that we, during the search for truth, should be surprised to find ourselves lonely and isolated. At the end of the day we are only responsible for ourselves. People, whether they are family, friends or others are only interested in their own life's agendas, and in the main only see what they are programmed to, most never think beyond what is considered normal life. It doesn't matter who they are to you, if your views don't concur with their ideas and lifestyle, you ultimately find that they are uncomfortable around you. They are where they are meant to be, just as I am, and that's the way it is. Because of the changed mind-set, and seeing the world the way it really is, on the one hand is the euphoria in finding the answers to the most important questions in one's life. The other is the loneliness, because looking around you there is no one to talk to, or share this with, because no one is on the same wavelength. That's why this specific forum is so unique, because each of us can share experiences with other like-minded people. I have always agreed with the saying that anything worth having is not easy to get, and anything easy to get is usually not worth having. Coming into contact with the information in Matrix V has taken many years of searching, yet these years have taught me so much because without the knowledge that I have acquired during this time, I would not have understood or have been ready for what Matrix V has taught me. There is a reason for situations we find ourselves in and everything that we do, although this may not always be clear or apparent to us at the time.\" \"I've been following the Matrix publications since the early 90's. Began reading Matrix V in June. I've noticed that it pushes buttons in my friends who claim to be very spiritual.\" \"First of all, let me tell you my life changed in every way after reading Matrix V. It made me doubt everything in my already doubtful life full of questions in search of the truth.

Every bit of it has struck a chord with me, and in many cases, you voiced and articulated sentiments and feelings I'd had and hadn't even really been aware of or how to state clearly. I've been on a search for information about life and the universe since around the time I was 13, and up until recently, most of the information I've been able to find has been light-sider, light-worker, new age, etc. There's been some useful info through all that shit but it’s always been frustrating trying to weed out what applies and what's simply utter crap.

Much of your material served as welcome confirmation to what I have known within since early childhood but never had very much \"outside\" validation of. This being so, your direct and often pointed and humorous approach added a very welcome dimension to the review. As for the 'new to me stuff WOW!! Mind blowing and so exciting. I have been reading and re-reading since late August and feel so alive. I have witnessed countless confirmations of the Orion female material and even recognized many patterns from my early experience and some still lingering now. The understanding of the DNA commands is essential to overcome these patterns, at least for me. I am almost saddened to see the infiltration of \"Female Power\" in countless movies and other forums of expression here. I am rather unplugged from the mainstream media and have been for about six years yet still see evidence daily of the obvious control being propagated. I am ever more focused on the new paradigm, and full connection with my higher self because of this invaluable material. For this gift words cannot explain both my gratitude and excitement. I could go on and on with this praise but sense you have no real use for it. Just know that your material is reaching many. Even those who on the surface appear to be Long Island housewives. I was working diligently on releasing residual female programming about how I looked, ate, spoke (I tend to swear like a sailor when I get excited:-) dressed ad nausea when I was prompted from within one afternoon to order the book. What a help. The thought forms on Long Island are so large and powerful surrounding all things of body consciousness. I was having a bit of a struggle. While reading Matrix V I giggled yet shuddered at having faced so many of the obstacles you mentioned with focus primarily to males ( e.g., forced marriage before I was strong enough to say NO, the battle over my retaining my healing career and staying financially independent of my husband and most recently the battle of breeding which I have stood strong and refused to do; but not until I read your book did I fully understand why.) These concepts have all been pushed at the hands of my mother in law a dynamic that does not escape me, her control of my husband is the role generally played by wife... At any rate, your material has truly helped me to balance any of my remaining tendencies towards control et all via these DNA mechanisms which are fostered by the sleeping masses and their current puppeteers. Your mention of the Matrix movies axiom about anyone in the Matrix being an enemy to those trying to get out of the matrix is an example I have used many times. I have many questions that arose during my reading but will continue to put them to my higher self and wait to see if any remain gray or fuzzy enough for me to direct to you and your obvious experience. Your continued and forceful reminder to remain true to self and to stand strong on the path of discovery as well as your reminder of accepting where one is without comparing is all so beautiful and one of the things I most appreciated about your work. I have known for years how our beliefs and lenses as I call them create our reality here and I have been working to ascend above polarity consciousness this is yet another area your work proved to be both essential and perfect for. The Light-sider stuff was stumping me. I would see it for what it was, including a ploy by the dark-siders, but found little to support this outside of a gut theory until your work! Many a friend has passed out of my life because of their addiction to the Ascended Masters, Angels, God outside of self and the general \"save me oh power outside of myself \" game. Before reading this material I was staring to question if I was the only one who noticed this new age trap and felt the dark energy posing as light behind it. Alas now as my focus is now fostered I will attract beings of like mind and forge ahead in my own understanding. Yahoo. Thank you again sir for your brave, funny and most of all heart opening work.

Not only to me but probably to everyone who has been in contact with your material. At your advice I have read M5 and Bob's trilogy. And it has literally changed my world - not only the view, but also my participation in it. You have pushed me on the rocky road - which is a good thing - because right now its already getting smoother and the results are definitely worth it.

Since that time I've read Matrix I, II, III, IV and now V (I also keep up w/your website material). The person who is writing the information for Advanced Incarnations is very aware. A major source of very advanced information during my \"awakening\" has been the Advanced Incarnation Material.

When I first started reading the posts about women on the trufax site, I had mixed feelings. I knew the author was right, but It still did not fill good to admit. I tried to force myself to make changes but I was not ready and it was not natural. Than when I read Matrix V, it just just clicked and now I can see it clearly. I am a member of an e-mail list. One of the girls was talking about how we should \"guide\" (control) men and instruct them on the proper way to do certain things. I usually stay out of it, but it made me so mad that I had to tell her off! After witnessing my own reaction to the girl's post, I actually realize that I have been unconsciously changing. I never would have picked up on the control aspects of the comment before reading the Matrix. My relationship with my spouse is also evolving. Neither of us feel the need to force anything anymore (sex, convo, etc). I also used to get mad or upset when he went out with the guys. It was all about control and trying to make sure he did things the way I wanted him too. I was scared that the guys would influence him more than I could. 1 do not feel that way anymore. I have also realized what I have gained from him. I really think that I was led to him. It was through him that I gained access to some of the more eye opening occurrences in my life (such as this). We have had convo's on our relationship and both agree that when we feel we no longer need to be together, we will peacefully stay friends and go our separate ways. Before, that scared me, but now it does not. I have been looking at my life and I feel that this is one of the happier times. Things seem to be falling in to place.\" \"One of the biggest things that MATRIX V explained for me is to be Happy with where you are in one's Incarnational Cycle. I think worrying if your Awakened or Not or a Dominant or a Middle Advanced shows one's Ego talking. Be Happy with where you are. If you read MATRIX V or have the book it seems one was able to connect to valuable information. Process what you can and chuck the rest if it doesn't resonate with you at the moment is what I do. Part of me would like to boast about how Final I am....but in the bigger picture thru reading MATRIX V, whatever level one is at, if you observe and learn and live the experiences one is faced in life with a sense of Humor and detachment, it really doesn't matter to me, as long as I am in the process of attempting to connect to my Higher Self and letting that info flow thru my life, I am not in competition with anyone.

There would then follow a long period of self-condemnation, consisting of beating myself up for “being such a coward”, etc. Yet, in spite of all the self-berating, that \"still small voice\" within would be resting quite comfortably with these decisions. This shows me the distinction between the status quo approval of the ego and the gentle urgings from my inner most self. This kind of inner battle has gone on most of my life. I know now that 1 don't have to do that any more because I am able to see it for what it is and which voice is really doing the talking. All my life I have been doing these kind of things. No more!

The specific information regarding genders/gender splits very clearly states the conflicts caused as a result of the gender split and I have noticed this for a long time and the Matrix V information brings things into even better focus. It is time to move past the bullshit and the agendas being pushed by the polarities (whether terrestrial or extraterrestrial) of this planet (\"alien invasion\", \"aliens running the planet\", \"follow me I'll save you\", \"this group is right/this group is wrong\", etc.).

I have had continual friction with the opposite sex, particularly when it comes to ideology...If I am truthful about what I feel and see concerning trends such as 'feminism', the 'women's movement', the emerging totalitarian state, etc. I am ridiculed mercilessly as small minded and reactionary. Eventually, each potential relationship was thwarted by a decision by myself to be true to myself and stick to my values and what I know to be true.

I had some definite reaction to the \" roughness\" with which the author endeavored to communicate not only the truth about women and their programming, but also his very personal feelings about such. After letting all the reactions and arguments play out, I understood that it doesn't matter. The author is very concise at conveying his message, it's just a different frequency of communication. So after getting down to what is important, well, it's the information no matter how it is presented.

M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Supplementary Materials Organized Planetary Out of Body Activities & Polarity Influence By Val Valerian On Exploring The Unknown \"Since truth is greater than our concepts about it, loving the truth means loving truth more than any one perspective. Even the best paradigm falls short of (the true nature of) reality, which is infinite and surpasses our most advanced ideas. We can't be dogmatic about a paradigm and at the same time be capable of responding in dialogue. In dialogue, we stay open to exploring our ideas and perceptions from the ground up. Because reality is infinite [and non-linear], there's always room for evolution. Dialogue begins as we put our temporarily suspended models on the table for consideration while we discover the reality behind them, and how they relate to other models. Participants must treat each other as equal partners \"in the pursuit of truth\". Differences enrich the process as a result of the nature of a shared path of evolving awareness, while dialogue creates a space that's \"safe\" for \"exploring the truth\". Exploration of the currents of collective thought is part of the process. Defending one paradigm or another isn't the focus in dialogue. Broadening our awareness is. The jockeying that goes on in hierarchies through win-lose discussions becomes irrelevant.” Chris Largent and Denise Breton, The Paradigm Conspiracy, 1996. It is well known that Monroe Institute shared research projects with Stanford Research Institute, and that both institutions have, for a long time, processed intelligence personnel from the CIA, NSA, and other agencies. Other researchers, such as Dr. John Lilly, who wrote “The Center of the Cyclone”, have conducted innumerable experiments that have led to contact with other entities on levels outside Earthbound third density reality. For those who have never read these three works, it is highly recommended - these three books are pivotal pieces of literature in the field. It is also well known that various intelligence agencies have had interaction with various forms of alien life over the years, and that they are not forthcoming about either their knowledge or experience relative to these matters. Now, perhaps for the first time, we are able to present (thanks to the graciousness of a LEIRG member) an inside look at past activities at the Monroe Institute, potential alien influence and possible links to intelligence operations. You will also recognize some familiar themes relative to alien interaction, especially in regard to the process of the extraction of emotional states. We will relate this material to you, and then provide comments and analysis afterward. We highly encourage response from LE readers relative to their own experience in these areas. 545"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"The material relative to this matter was expressed in a detailed letter to Leading Edge International Research Group in April 1992. The sender of the letter will remain anonymous. Underlining is my own: “Dear Val, Thanks for writing and asking about my alien related experience at the Monroe Institute in September 1990. It was my scheduled turn, during the week’s Advanced Guidelines Program, to spend a session in the “booth”. The “booth” is located in Monroe’s laboratory and is built so that the subject is totally cut off from all exterior influences of light, sound, and electromagnetic. It is a square room, extremely well insulated and rests on sand. The interior is carpeted and the subject rests on a special type water bed that has a heavily-salted solution inside. Once the door is closed, you can’t even see your hand in front of your face. A microphone is lowered in front of you and you wear a special set of headphones in order to be linked with the control booth. After being hooked up to measuring devices I was left alone in total darkness. My monitor, S., who is former military intelligence officer (are they ever really ‘former’?) started Monroe’s Leveling tape, through which I advanced at my own pace to Focus 10, 12 and then 15, where time and space cease to exist. I have a copy of the tape with the conversation between S. and me: ‘At first I felt as if I were floating, then a tapping began on my lower left leg. On Level 15, a pillar of light turned into a triangle and I tried to follow it.’ ‘I see a globe with multi-faceted surfaces. It moves around as if scanning. I try to communicate with it without success. A flashing light joins the globe and moves around quickly like a bee. Different kinds of lights start to slowly move. What appears to be a large eye is floating, and I get the impression that it is trying to instill fear in me.’ ‘At this point a beam of concentric circles is shot at my chest, and this stimulates (the feeling of) sorrow even though I logically should not feel this emotion. The beam hits from right to left on my chest. It is done to the point where tears arise due to the feeling of sorrow. I see the ray shoot repeatedly. I feel like I’m below them with the ray machine placed above me and I can feel that I am being watched. S.asks me if I am comfortable with this, and I am. I’ve never seen this before. It’s like something you don’t ever expect would ever happen to you and they (aliens) find this reaction puzzling. This comment makes them hesitate, ray off.’ ‘The large eye floats down again, seemingly to conduct an examination of me. It looks like a human eye, but (has) no communications to my questions.

More comments were made fbv the aliens') about the illogical nature of our emotions. ‘They want to try and harness the energy and put it to use, whatever that may be. The emotional radiation from this Planet drew them here. S. asks if there are other planets with emotions like ours. They reply, after I ask, that there are none so strong as here that they’ve found. The extreme range of emotions (of humans) is what they are most curious about. They are not willing to experience these emotions on our level. There seems to be a fear of experiencing emotion by these aliens. One alien cuts another off from speaking further and hits me with the ray again, between chest and throat this time — stronger than before and the tears run; I am unable to will this to stop, like a switch was thrown.’ ‘S. savs to tell them they can look and test but will not find unless they are willing to experience. They sav that this has been explained to them before, but some division exists as to who, if anv. should be the ones to experience. Some might like to — some won’t.’ ‘S. says to tell them many beings from many dimensions have decided to make this choice. They begin doing something else (to me) with a cone-shaped beam. They are testing to see where I come from. S: are you willing to reveal this to them? They don’t believe I can be native (to Earth) as I am resisting them mentally. The cone-shaped beam ceases.’ ‘They say they are willing to consider my arguments. They are likely to send one of their people down and follow him. They fear losing their control, their scientific control. I said they won’t be satisfied until they’ve all had their turn incarnating: they sav they will send one of their weaker ones. The dominant ones refuse to come. S: What do they value most? The aliens indicate that they value knowledge most and control secondly. S: Tell them on this world emotion and its feeling are valued more than knowledge. More dark alien eyes watching. I tell them I can get knowledge from a book, but the emotions come from experience.

He says that the others have overextended their stay. A panic occurs with the dark-eyed aliens when this human-looking alien came in. It seems that they are not as powerful as they lead me to believe. Due to (what appears to be) an overwhelming vibration (emanating) from the humanoid, it’s difficult for me to talk. He says I can call him Gor Don and throws up a web—like energy structure, which breaks the hold the dark—eyed ones have on the situation. The dark-eyed aliens leave. I thank the humanoid for his action and he moves away. I am then brought back (by the Monroe people) to full, waking consciousness.’ After the session. I asked S. what these aliens were called. He said he could not answer mv question. When I asked the Monroe Systems Engineer, who is also ex—military Intelligence, he said he could not talk about these matters. At this time, I had never heard of the “Greys”, “Pleiadians” or any of them, but when I returned home, I began my own research, which still continues. I am glad they gave me a copy of the tape. I played it while writing this and it triggered the memories in even sharper. I’m anxious to see what conclusions you draw from my experience.” MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Well, quite an experience. Here we see more possible evidence to support the thesis that certain species of gray—skinned aliens lack an emotional component, that these aliens can be manipulated because of their group consciousness because they consider a strongly held belief (even among their own group) to be evidence of the existence of a reality structure — they could not believe that they themselves could be under observation, but the idea alone left them vulnerable to outside manipulation. Also, the presence of this other humanoid alien, who was evidently of positive orientation, made them very nervous, betraying their overall conscious negative orientation. The aliens wish to understand without having experience, which is logical when you consider their own fear of actually experiencing the emotional states that they are studying in humans. With humans in the current cultural format, “learning” is comprised of rote memorization of “facts”. True learning (and the derivatives Wisdom and Truth, neither of which is dualistic) can ONLY be gained through experience. The aliens lack the capability to understand this vital point, fully admitting that their whole orientation toward “investigation of emotion” is filled with internal conflict. Despite their internal admission that they consider the emotional component essential. “To be complete”, they are unwilling to actually integrate emotion into their overall complex - Sincerely, Commentary and Analysis 548"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"emotion, in fact, is threatening to their sense of “order and control”. So, the alien quest is in fact a hopeless one, as long as they lack the understanding of these vital elements of the equation. It would appear, from the the letter, that there has been a long-standing relationship between the Monroe Institute and alien activities - apparently on many levels. That the aliens view the Monroe Institute for all intents and purposes as, in effect, one of their own laboratories for the study of humans is, in a way, quite ironic — it is apparent that the Monroe Institute is a source for alien—oriented intelligence data for U.S. intelligence agencies. It becomes a question of: who is studying who? Both sides, evidently, are studying each other through the common meeting ground of the Monroe Institute. When one considers all the information that is known about the Montauk projects, the Psi—Corps, and the progress of various agencies on very technical levels, it would appear that there is a real tug—of—war in progress. In Robert Monroe’s book “Far Journeys”, he proceeds in consciousness to view Earth around 3100 CE, where the planet is sparsely populated, most humans are discarnate but have use of physical bodies that are kept in “energy cocoons”, and they can, to a significant degree, manifest mass in any form simply by willing it. This is a vast departure from most of the post— apocalyptic scenarios we hear about — in fact, most of the “probable realities” we hear about. In Michael Talbot’s book “Holographic Universe”, several thousand people who had some degree of psychic ability were asked to state what they saw for the future, and all the answers fell neatly into four types of future realities - all of which reflected post apocalyptic scenes. From the Montauk project data, we see that government experiments using rotation of time—fields indicated that the view of the planet became really fantasy­ like after about 2013 CE, which is what one would expect if one were to view a fourth density framework from a third density viewpoint. One might conclude, therefore, that the views of the future that seem to be “negative” are in fact transitional probable futures, and are by no means a final state of affairs. Most of the material from “Prisms of Lyrae” and Bashar indicated that around 2025 the planet will be fully integrated with other species. Yet, when the planet is looked at 1000 years later, all this has changed. Whatever the future brings, in view of all this, it does not bode well for the Greys. Yet, despite this, Bashar indicates that the Essassani, his species, are in fact a hybrid species between humans and one specific species of the “Greys”. If this is the case, then it would appear that somewhere near the end of the 28th century, something enormously significant (albeit positive) occurs on this planet. Most of the activities of “human beings” are elevated to higher frequency levels, the New World Order, fortunately short-lived, drops away and beings progress into more conscious states. Included with the letter from this person, as an aside, were several pages of commentary where the person had sent several questions relative to the Monroe Institute experience to the ‘Cosmic Awareness’ group in Olympia. In the interests of research, the questions and answers were: Question: I have been to the Monroe Institute’s Gateway and Guideline Programs. The Institute he operates in Faber, Virginia, was set up with an alien guidance, and pillars of energy were placed in certain areas on the property. 1 have seen, as have others, these aliens who are guardians of the Institute, although they seem out of phase with the physical. While in the isolation booth, I was experimented on by the aliens, who looked like the Dulce Group. They said they wanted to find a way to synthesize emotions and used a beam to generate sorrow in me. They tried to get me to fear as well by using images. They failed at generating fear and seemed surprised when it failed. Another alien, this one different, came in, argued MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved, 549"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"with the aliens who were experimenting, and threw up a net—like barrier that cut them off from me. I sensed a strong, loving vibration from my “rescuer”. Would Awareness comment on this? Answer: This awareness indicates that it appears the aliens were playing the good cop/bad cop scenario for your benefit; that the second alien who rescued you was one who was seeking to create a relationship with you that could be used for further manipulation according to their mind control efforts. It appears the entire activity was designed to influence and control your consciousness or control your mind to some degree. It does not seem that they had perfected their experiments effectively enough to have much influence on you, however, it does appear that they have developed sufficient techniques to help establish a program of mind control that can be effective under certain circumstances. These circumstances are quite limited. Question: Are these aliens from the Pleiades or elsewhere? Answer: They do not appear to be from the Pleiades. The entities appear to be those who were born on earth as half-breeds, having some human qualities. Question: The Monroe Institute has former military intelligence officers working for them in key positions. They refuse to discuss any alien matters. Are they government plants? Answer: This appears to be in the affirmative. This ends the CAC interaction. Recently, there have been new light and sound brain synchronization devices (with the headphones and LED glasses) devised by former personnel of both Monroe Institute and Stanford Research Institute. The most “effective of these devices is the “Voyager”. I tried it for several weeks and found it quite interesting. We had it checked out electronically to see if we could find any subliminal programs embedded within the device , and we could not detect any. This does not mean that none exist. The recent proliferation of light and sound brain synchronization devices and so-called mind— machines during the last ten years seems to roughly parallel some kinds of alien activity. There may be no direct connection, however.... Many thanks to the LEIRG contributor for his courage and ongoing research - and his contribution to the overall level of knowledge of Leading Edge Research Journal readers. Subsequent Correspondence on This Matter: The following was my reply to the author of the April 1992 letter: MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Leading Edge Research Group Yelm, Washington 98597 Dear ^ 21 April 1992 Your letter of the 25th was in reference to the Monroe Institute, and the fact that you perceived the Hemi-Synch process to correlate with the 6th brain areas and above. There are a couple things relative to the matter of the Monroe Institute that I feel moved to discuss. Recently, in the last six months, there have been an increase in light—sound brain synchronization devices, notably, The Voyager, which I had a chance to work with for about 550"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"two weeks. Our engineers analyzed it and it appears, at this time, that there are no subliminals embedded in the programming, but I would not take this as a definite “no” for there are methods of nesting subliminals running parallel to existing frequency harmonics that would make them difficult if not impossible to detect without sophisticated spectrum analysis equipment. Nevertheless, it would appear that the device has some external benefits for the mass consciousness, in that it might enable enough transient neural synchronization to initiate a process toward acquisition of a more conscious state. In the final analysis, “the jury is still out” relative to these devices, which interestingly enough end up appearing in the culture just as other electronic mind control programs are gearing up. Considering that the people who developed the Voyager used to work at both Monroe and Stanford Research Institute, one cannot totally eliminate the possibility of a covert application being disseminated culturally at this time - a view that is perhaps accentuated by the fact that the people who designed the Voyager live here locally and will not divulge information about the frequency shifts that are programmed into the device. I am most interested in your experiences in consciousness while at the Monroe Institute, especially with reference to your perception that-the Grays were attempting to synthesize an emotional response from you. I would like you to go into detail about your experience, that I may fully understand it, and follow it up with any questions you may have, and I will attempt to answer them or, if I do not immediately know the answer, I will get one. Most Sincerely, MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. Val Valerian, Director Leading Edge Research Group Reply Received: Dear Val, May 8,1992 I am impressed that you thought enough of my alien experience at the Monroe Institute to present in so well (Editor note: a copy of the preceding was sent to this individual for commentary) as you did in the copy you sent me. After looking through my Institute files, I chose a few things to forward to you for your information - The Gateway Affirmation is used by each of the in-residence students near the beginning of each tape exercise. Begin with Energy Conversion Box. (Editor note: definitions of these items can be found at the end of the section on this subject), followed by Resonant Tuning, REBAL (resonant energy balloon) and finally the Gateway Affirmation. After this procedure, the students are ready to explore or be guided by Robert Monroe in the individual exercise. Please refer to the enclosed sheet — Gateway Tools - for information on the above steps. To answer your first question, the Energy Bar Tool is developed by each participant during Gateway - the initial week, everyone must attend before taking the advanced Guidelines or Lifelines Courses. There is a note on EBT on the Gateway Tools Sheet. In more detail, Monroe in Focus 10, leads the participants in a visualization and creation of the EBT using various colors and sizes from wand length (one foot in my case) down to a small circle, varying between these, shapes to eventually settle on the wand shape for me. All 551"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"primary colors are included after the shape is finalized. The colors rapidly blend until I had a pure white wand. This wand is always with me as the EBT is with all participants. It can be used as a universal translator, a device for self-defense, or simply as a device to direct energies. The aliens in my booth experience did not feel threatened by the Energy Bar Tool, however I did not wish to use it in any manner that they would feel threatened, as I knew that they had their own weapons. I prefer to learn rather than set up a conflict situation, especially as I knew I could leave anytime I wished, my will being the stronger, alien devices not withstanding. To your second question, Monroe, during Gateway, told our group about the beams of energy that are placed in various areas of the Monroe Institute. Monroe has a photograph of one of these pillars of energy. Their origin is alien. My booth experience was my most dramatic experience during that Guideline week. One night a friend of mine who also attended the Guidelines week did a channel session with an insectoid alien. She also was the medium this alien used in her booth experience. Her body temperature lowered into the 70’s. I asked the alien if we could see a ship in this area that would let itself be known to use if we went up to the observation deck of the Institute. When she emerged from her trance, we went up to the roof, around 10pm, and one of the “stars” moved closer and flashed a light that briefly lit up the landscape like a flash from a camera (our greeting) and then it moved off. On another night, she and I were alone on the porch outside the dining room. While talking to her, I noticed a humanoid shape standing to my left between us. I mentioned to her that an alien was standing there and listening to us. She replied that she was wondering when I was going to mention it. The figure then disappeared. This happened before my booth experience and I feel it is the same being who stopped the aliens in the booth from further “tests” on me. When I told the Registrar at the Institute about the booth experience and the interference by the alien who called himself Gor Don, she told me someone else had an experience with a being who used that name. I did have a couple contacts with aliens who appeared to be friendly during that week, but no experiences were as shocking or cruel as those in the booth. The experience with the friendly aliens were rather pleasant. If you are interested, I’ll search the tapes for more details than what I remember off-hand. In reference to your third question, Monroe did tell the group about some types of aliens that he had seen while exploring out of body. Most of the aliens that he has dealt with are multi-dimensional in nature. During Lifelines in February 1992, Monroe told our group that he was taken from his room in an out-of-the body state by two small Greys. They put him on a table and were preparing to begin an examination when he got up off of the table, patted one of the aliens on the cheek and said “No, No” and left, and was unopposed. He said that by not showing fear we can control these types of situations. He’s right! Your last question asks for my overall assessment of my booth experience. The booth was my final experience at the Institute during Guidelines. It was this experience and the lack of willingness to give any answers by the former intelligence staff that was my driving force to MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group, All Rights Reserved. 552"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"research and find out for myself what is going on. Needless to say, when I began looking under the rocks, I was surprised at what I saw. My intensive research continues, almost two years later. As for what I learned about myself, I discovered that there was no fear on my part during this experience, although a couple other Guideline participants said they would be terrified if it happened to them. My psychic abilities have developed much more rapidly since then. I am learning much more about myself and who I am. 1 am indebted to the Monroe Institute for the vast amount of knowledge gained there. The only negative aspect is that I am very disappointed with those at the Institute who refused to discuss aliens with me, Since then, my research and discoveries about the government alien cover-up have answered some of those questions. The Monroe Institute attracts mostly professionals, engineers, doctors, etc., due to its scientific approach, however I feel that there are a few missing pieces to the overall picture. I do recommend the Monroe experience, as it opens up the dimensions to the participants and teaches many valuable techniques. I would go again. I hope this helps. If you have any more questions, please send them. Anxious for your reply. Sincerely 2 Subsequent Correspondence on This Matter: After this interaction, on May 12, 1992 I wrote ^ with a significant list of questions, to which he responded on May 26th: Dear ^ Thank you for your very informative letter. After reading it very closely, more questions surfaced in my mind about the experience at Monroe Institute: 1. Could you give me more functional information about the EBT, including how it is used as a “universal translator device”, and how it is used as a device to direct energies. In addition, would you define and expand on the functional nature and behavior of the energies that it is used to direct? Answer: When we created the Energy Bar Tool (EBT), Monroe told us that we could use it as a universal translator simply by holding it and willing it to be such. The EBT would then assist in the telepathic translations. It is used as an energy-directing device similar to a wizard’s wand; the EBT would be the gathering place of energies released through its forward tip. As the EBT is one of the first programs during the Gateway Program, it is my opinion that it is a device created to give one the confidence necessary to function well in the out of the body state. I did not use the EBT very much in Gateway, and not at all in Lifelines. Yet, at the same time, I know of people who use it all the time. I still have an EBT. Perhaps it functions without conscious use. Energies used by my EBT would come as beams or cones depending on use. See response to question #3. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. 553"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"2.Why do you think that the aliens in the booth experience were not threatened by your EBT? Answer: When “S” suggested I show “them” my EBT, I hesitated. I just knew they would not feel threatened by it -1 didn’t want them to take it either. Whether they noticed it or not I don’t know. I did have another device with me that could be used as a weapon if I chose to do so. In an earlier Focus 15 experience (with no physical limits or time involved) I was met in an out-of-the-body state by an alien who was quite friendly. He said he was one of the “Fardaz”. They live on a mountainous sharp-peaked world. Their residences are built into the sides of the mountains -1 saw one. The outside of their homes is made up of a glasslike material that can be made clear or darkened for privacy. The alien was interested in my EBT, as I had it in my right hand and was using it to guide me. I showed it to him and he wanted to exchange a similar object that was rod-like for my EBT. I agreed. The exchange was made and he was gone. At the time, I was impressed with the whole thing but never had the chance to ask him how it operates. It was as if he thought I understood its method of operation. The session ended and I verbally reported this experience to the group. The alien device is 18 inches long and has red and blue buttons. The lower 6 inches is the handle, and it can be twisted and turned. I knew that one of its functions was as a weapon. It could be that the aliens were so intent on my physical reactions to their experiments that they really didn’t pay attention to me, or that both devices were well concealed in my own energy field. Shortly after I received the alien device, I used the EBT construction program tape by myself and built a new one. 3.How many ways have you personally used the EBT. Would you describe these usages and the resulting situations? Answer: I’ve used the EBT as a navigator by holding it in my right hand and willing it to take me somewhere. Once, in Guidelines, we were told to go beyond the galaxy. For me, the experience was like the “Power of 10” movie. It was easy to get outside of the Milky Way. It is a totally silent experience and difficult to put into words, but the memory remains. I got sufficiently far out to turn and look at the massive spiral. Since pink is the*“color of non- sexual love”, I formed pink hearts of love in my mind, then used the EBT to transmit them. They shot out of the tip in countless numbers through a cone ray. The pink lights scattered toward the spiral and the stars. Soon after, they disappeared, and I saw a number of pink lights come from various stars and they came toward me, assumedly sent by the inhabitants of these systems. I then returned to Earth. An experience! When other beings noticed the EBT, the swirling colors within always caught their attention.

All Rights Reserved. 4.What kind of weapons did the aliens themselves have? Answer: The aliens, in my booth experience, did have weapons. Since I couldn’t grab one for a souvenir, I didn’t focus much on them. My feelings are that if their weapon was fired at me, something very unpleasant would happen and I didn’t care to find out. The weapon seemed rectangular with an operational button on the narrow side. I did not notice a hand grip like a pistol has. 5.Upon what discernible principles were those weapons based? Answer: The weapon was some type of beam weapon. Wish I could have gotten one. 554"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group. All Rights Reserved. 6.Would you comment on the aspects of the use of will? Answer: It was my will that kept me in control. My lack of fear in the situation, despite what was happening, was the thing that kept me in control. I know I could have ended the whole thing at any time but I wasn’t going to pass up this rare experience. I wanted to know and to observe. My training in the psychic world kicked in. I didn’t want my physical damaged as I was anxious to get back and tell others of my experience. I was disappointed because the former intelligence people only wanted to hear about my experience and didn’t want to answer my questions. It sort of closed down my desire to go into anywhere near as much depth as I have with you. 7. Have you experienced a contest of will between your self and other species? If so, what w r ere the results and mechanics of the interaction? Answer: When, at one point, the booth aliens wanted to exert their control over me, they used a device to send images of monster-like creatures threatening me. They didn’t have the desired effect - just the opposite. I stood there passively watching that event, then said, “you gotta do better than that”, and the images ceased. I believe they use patterns that had the desired effect on other humans. This is the only time I have a conscious memory of a clash of wills. 8.In your observation, what alien manipulative devices have you encountered. If any, please describe the appearance, apparent function and other information as related to these weapons. Answer: The ray emitting device I noticed hung over me like an operating room light. 1 noticed two beam emitting devices on this unit. One was rod-like with a point at its end. The other one had a bulge-like clear end on it and concentric circles of energy came at me from it. The rod-like one sent a steady beam that stimulated the emotion of sorrow. The multi-faceted ball seemed to be metallic and remote controlled. The large eye—like object was connected to a large cable in the back. I felt this was a device used for observation by beings other than the aliens I saw. While I didn’t notice any weapons other than the hand­ held device, I had the feeling they didn’t think they needed to be armed as their confidence was in their “emotion generators -They did not expect my lack of reaction. I would imagine they have since made alterations in their plans for this contingency. 9.Have you observed government personnel engaged in alien operational missions or functional support aspects? Answer: I did not observe any government personnel engaged with the aliens, however I was surprised by “S’s” lack of surprise or concern over the situation I was in. It may be that he is one of the government personnel, but that is just speculation on my part, even though the entity concerned with “Cosmic Awareness” did point a finger there. 10.Have you gleaned the functional purpose of the energy pillars at the Monroe Institute? What can you say about the alien origin of these pillars? Is there any data regarding the specific species with w’hom these pillars originate, and their possible interrelationship with either the Monroe Institute or the government?"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"Answer: The energy pillars are scattered throughout the Monroe Institute. Monroe mentioned them to our Gateways class and has a photo of one of them. It’s a beam coming right up from the ground. He said they were placed in the ground by alien intelligences after they bought the property and started the Institute. The Institute is built on a mountain that consists primarily of a specific kind of quartz. If you rub two pieces together in the dark, sparks fly. I have some of it. Monroe believes that the entities who placed the pillars are benevolent, but he has not revealed their origin. Supposedly, the pillars are there to accelerate the learning processes of those who attend the courses at the Institute. This would, of course, attract the attention of the government. n.What other data were you able to extract during the session with the insectoid alien species, relative to their psychology, mission, purpose, interaction with other species, the Monroe Institute, or other Institute participants? Answer: The booth aliens were not friendly and were not interested in answering many of my questions, ignoring the “where are you from?” line of questioning. They did not care for the alien who walked in at the end; the alien who walked in appeared, somehow, to be more advanced than they were, as their access to me was cut off by the other entity. When I verbally reported my booth experience to the group, certain members of the group became upset and expressed their “fear” that the other group of entities would come and “snatch” me again. One man in the Lifelines, during an OBE session, said he saw the aliens I had described, who were in turn watching those of us at the Institute; they were not reported by him to be friendly. 12.Did you get au impression of what alien groups are interacting in and around the Institute? What do their specific motives appear to be? Answer: The booth aliens were there mainly for their research on emotions; they conducted work which centered around this aspect of human beings. The other main alien group (Gor Don) appears human or humanoid to me. The ones who set the pillars seem to be observing everything with an intent that is seemingly positive. 13.Did you get an impression of the frequency of alien ship proximity cases at the Institute? Answer: I feel the constant alien activity there draws others out of curiosity, if for no other reason. Those energy pillars, at the very least, should draw them. I’m sure an alien ship is always there, slightly out of range of the physical frequency. 14.Did you get to investigate the other individual you mentioned who had contact with Gor Don? If so, what did you glean from this person about Gor Don, their mindset, etc.? Answer: When I told the Institute Registrar about my booth experience, she told me of another participant who met the Gor Don under similar circumstances. She did not say who it was, and I did not pursue it at the time as I was too caught up in my own experiences. 15.Can you go into detail about the interaction with other alien species that demonstrated a friendly attitude? Can you also describe these species? Also, how did the Monroe Institute view reports of interaction with “positive” and “negative” species? Answer: The aliens who appeared to be benevolent seemed to be about 5 foot 8 inches tall, slight in build, and humanoid in shape. My guess is that if indeed they did place the pillars, M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Ouest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

The Institute is peppered with incidents involving friendly beings who seem interested in the advancing development of the people who attend the Institute. When Monroe, during Lifelines, was asked to comment on the issue of abductions and the Greys at the Institute, he admitted that he was abducted by short Grey beings. They placed him on an examining table, as I mentioned earlier, and attached a device to his genitals (Editor note: electronic programming is being attempted). He got up, patted one of them on the cheek and said, “no, no”, then he left. This left them stunned, because he didn’t fit their typical expectation (of a fear-prone human steeped in victimhood). The Institute is interested in all alien reports, but will only take the information and won’t provide any to the people who experience alien interaction. One of the former intelligence officers, Dave, was asked about the aliens during Lifelines and he said he “could not discuss these matters.” 16.Did Monroe ever describe anything in detail to you in the briefings about the nature, assumed purpose, and activities of the dimensional beings he encountered as it would apply to your own experiences at M.I.? Answer: Monroe said assistance from inter-dimensional beings is common and, in our training at Gateway, we are made comfortable with that. Monroe wants us not to fear anything. Likewise he does not, however, speak much about the aliens unless cornered. It was only during Lifeline when he mentioned his own abduction. He said something, but not enough for me. Monroe talked quite a bit about the dimensional beings, as opposed to the other aliens, but his advice is to see what happens on our own individual journeys and report back. 17.What would you assess as the functional nature of the booth, relative to the activities of various species and the interactions with MI participants? Answer: The functional nature of the booth is to totally isolate you from as many vibratory forces as possible (electrical, light, sound, etc). It is specially constructed. Inside the bed, as I said, was a heavily salted water solution. This is so no normal external source can influence your activity. No participant is told what may or may not happen, as they do not want to set up expectations ahead of the experiences. 18. Would you go into detail about the types of “tests” that were conducted on you by various species, the efforts by various species to illicit various emotional responses, to entrap you into programming modes, etc? Answer: The prime experiment performed on me in the booth was to try and synthesize emotions. I was only one of a string of “subjects”. The emotion they were studying with me was sorrow, the triggers for sorrow, and the manifestation of sorrow. While. I watched what was happening to my physical self, when asked by ‘S’ to respond to one of his questions, it took considerable effort to control the physical to respond in an even tone of voice. The ray that hit me in the chest, in my opinion, affected the heart center or chakra and caused the stimulation and release of the emotion, as they fired the beam across my chest. The nature of the tests performed under the influence of the multi-faceted ball are unknown to me; it was almost hypnotic in nature. The huge eye device, I feel, was a remote scanning instrument. I have no idea who could have been behind the use of it. They wanted to find out “who I really am”. From talking to other participants, almost everyone had emotional experiences, although no one else in my particular group mentioned aliens.

Apart from the physical reaction, I experienced no unusual probing. 19..Are you aware of various experiments being performed on others at the MI? If so, what is the nature of those experiments; how are they different from experiments applied to you? Answer: There are other experiments at the Institute. There is a brain—mapping program, as well as the “Inner Circle” experiments. Data on those can be found in the enclosed Monroe catalogs. The latest program is the “Dolphin Energy Club”. This was added to Lifelines. Monroe leads you to create your own “dolphin energy that can be used to heal yourself and others on a remote basis. If you are interested, I have two tapes that are used at the Institute for this — Side 1 is forming the dolphin. Side 2 is practical usage. If you have never done Monroe tapes, there might be difficulty in moving to focus levels required. 20. How do you assess the rationale for having various members of the intelligence community participate at the MI? Answer: To have one former intelligence officer there is one thing, but to have three of them there makes you wonder. One of them is even married to Monroe’s daughter - this is one of Monroe’s remote viewing specialists. As I mentioned in my first segment, are “former” intelligence officers ever really “former”? I believe the government has its claws on the technology. During Lifelines in February 92, Monroe told us that somebody in Switzerland wants to purchase the use of Hemi—Synch and use it for beaming down on the people of the world via satellite. The backers, we were told, want to remain confidential. As soon as I heard this, red flags went off, and I got them going with other participants. This is mind control stuff. Monroe said it could be used to calm people or even put them to sleep. He is fascinated with the possibilities. When I mentioned the aspects of military control, he responded that it was his major concern. You know very well if they have it, they will use it, Val, if they are not doing so already. It’s not by accident that these type of men are here. Who else? 21.Have you detected the presence of alien species at the MI that subsist off human energy fields? If so, please describe. Answer: I have not detected aliens who live off human energy fields here at Monroe. 22.What specific kinds of psychic abilities have you acquired since your MI experiences? How have these different kinds of abilities contributed to or detracted from specific kinds of interaction with alien species? What were the results and mechanics of the interaction? Answer: My psychic abilities have increased tremendously since my experiences at the Institute. I have been able to do various out-of-body shamanistic work - soul retrievals, etc., can interact with my past incarnations and experience other dimensional levels. I have only begun to explore all the possibilities. I have had some luck in time travel as well, in the OBE state, having gone to 1600 and up to 2200. Intuition is greatly heightened. These examples will do for now. I hope that all this helps. MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

In April 1991 I spent about two weeks in Sedona, Arizona, learning shamanistic techniques from my Native American teacher. The September events at Monroe and my intensive research (I was reading MATRIX II at the time) suddenly prompted me to ask my teacher if I had an alien implant in me. She told me to ask the Brazilian shaman who was also in our small group. When I first asked him, he laughed and said he didn’t think there was anything, but he’d look just the same using psychic methods. (Note: this man is a Brazilian MD in the Brazilian Navy. He is in his 30’s and a renowned psychic healer in Brazil). The next day he told me, “I cut the circuit.” When I questioned what he said, he repeated the same sentence and said he would remove it the next day. He pointed to my forehead (left side near the temple) when he said this. Using his psychic abilities, he cut the circuit so the device was inoperable. The following day, he used a quartz laser wand to remove the implant. When he touched the tip of the crystal to my forehead, I felt nervous and a slight puling in the area of the implant. The shaman had a small coal burning in a brazier during the process. He tossed the implant immediately into the brazier as soon as he pulled it out - my first experience with psychic surgery. He had just started talking to me about it when a “crack”, like the sound a snail firecracker would make, made us both jump. It was the implant exploding. I was impressed — so was he. The next day he said he needed to increase my protective field with gold-colored light. (Note: we use gold light as a higher protection than white, as those who chose to use the. negative of white, black, can easily detect white, but not gold). That night my motel room, I awoke from a sound sleep and immediately looked to the foot of the bed and saw an alien like the one I saw at the Monroe Institute. I viewed him through the golden protective field. The clock said 3:20 am. I said, “oh, it’s only you”, then ignored him and went back to sleep. The next day I related the incident to the shaman and to my teacher — and now to you.

All Rights Reserved. There are several orthodox definitions of what synchronicity means, and they are all based on 3 rd density linear perspectives of this non-linear dynamic, such as that of therapist Carl Jung. In terms of moving toward a real understanding of synchronicity, the subject having been of great interest for the last 30 years, the best ohe I have found (from a non-linear perspective) seems very similar to some of the Seth Material which arrived on the scene in the 1970’s. It was said to come from a 5 th density source (Bashar) that was part of group awareness, and I ran across it about ten years ago. It’s the highest quality definition I know of. It goes something like this, and it mentions the linear approach perspective as well: \"Synchronicity is the conscious perception in a physiological time track of the simultaneous manifestation of the multi-dimensional universe. It is the conscious recognition that all events, objects, relationships, points of view, perceptions and interactions are ONE thing viewed from different perspectives. As the basic resonant vibration of the system increases, synchronicity becomes more easily perceptible within experiential reality. Synchronicity is also a reflection of what you believe your reality to be. Synchronicity, relative to reality, IS what reality IS, and it is the WAY it is.” The conscious perception of the dynamic of synchronicity begins to appear at some point in incarnational experiences because recognition of the dynamic is inherently part of the expansion of awareness. Back when Matrix IV was being written (1996), keeping in mind that that book was written from a different perspective than this one, one of the interesting paradigms at the time was that of the Flower of Life information. The information at the time was quite interesting to me in a number of ways. The material gave another alternative version of some of the historical dynamics on the planetary manipulation for perusal, an interesting presentation on sacred geometry and its relationship to processes of DNA manipulation using light ( which if you read it objectively parallels the jehovah group DNA photonic manipulation material comprising the Keys of Enoch book), and some other unique elements for study. However, one of the elements in the material featured discussions about the subject of synchronicity which a great number of people have talked about ever since, especially the discussion of the relationship of the perception of repeating numbers in ones environment, and how that indicated, in essence, that “one was in the flow”. The phenomenon of repeating jwmbers (1111,111,222,2222,etc) as perceived in the environment (on buildings, license plates, anywhere) and the relationship between the timing of the perception of the numbers and “how your life is going at the moment” can produce an experiential legacy that can indicate whether perception of these numbers means anything for you. That’s where personal journals can come in handy, recording long­ term observations in order to determine both patterns and deeper dynamics. Frankly, any process can be associated with any other process in the mind and used as a tool, of sorts. I have used this repeating number observational “check” for several years. You can create all sorts of meanings from this aspect of the dynamic, such as “If I see a repeating digit I must be in the right place, at the right time, and I am in the flow”. However, while this might make one feel better, that approach may not be entirely accurate because there are indications that “we” are always “in the flow” - it’s just our orientation that is “out of the flow”. So, it’s not so much us (on a level of being) as it is our perspective. 560 I"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"Nevertheless, after studying the “repeating numbers” aspect of this part of the dynamic of synchronicity for several years, I have noticed that for me the numbers appear most frequently when life is going smoothly, and hardly appear at all when things around you indicate otherwise. This connection has been consistently perceptible for many years. 1 have often thought to myself, when behind a vehicle with such a license plate, “I wonder what that persons life is like since they’re driving around with a repeating number all day long?” For those who observe the repeating number phenomenon in this way, such people must, in some sense, unknowingly function as “facilitators” for a lot of people. It would make an interesting study to Find out if there was any general trend present with these people. If you have established a “baseline” in your life and you are pretty much in the flow all the time, I would think that you could put a sticker with a repeating number on the back of your car, on the bumper, and see if anything happens differently. Of course, if you pick “666” and happen to be in front of a Christian ... life might be different quickly. The phenomenon of repeating numbers, in some literature, also extends to repeating words, phrases and themes, and could of course be extended theoretically to include any externally repetitive event. Don’t forget that we are talking about examining external patterns, so don’t get too hung up on this. You need to learn how to be “in the flow” (in tune with your incarnational mandate, perhaps) without any externals, which is what eventually happens as synchronicity becomes commonplace and you get used to the presence of a certain krwwingness within you that you can recognize. The more you notice it, the more you notice it. What hung people up in the Flower of Life material, relative to this, was that meaTiings were assigned to the different numbers. The number 777 indicated one thing and 444 indicated another, for example. No basis for the assignment of meanings was revealed. Although intriguing to a tot of people, the process of assigning meaning in effect “pre­ programmed” thought patterns along certain lines, when in actual fact it is the synchronicity that is important, nfil the specific number itself. The bottom line is that you can make your temporary tools as simple or as complicated as you want. If you keep it simple, it’s easier to let go of the tool when you need to let go. If you want to assign meanings and create a whole big ritual out of this... you might be creating another potential “box” for yourself to extract yourself from later. When the element of synchronicity becomes an aspect of daily life, you don’t have to think about it too much. Hardly a day goes by that doesn’t include events that seemingly have a non-linear relationship with something else. The major aspect of all of this, in the end, is that your Higher Self is always synchronous with the universe, and that this whole subject of synchronicity on 3 rd density eventually involves directing your attention from observation of external patterns to observation of internal experience as the alignment between the persona and the Higher Self increases and you begin to have experience which probes into “inner space”.

While the Handbook contains many excellent comments, it is not. on the same level as Matrix 5 Gold Edition. It is a good trilogy to read, especially at mid-Advanced levels, but it is of lightside polarity and proposes action to change the game (prevent polarity action) and has sequential leanings. Extracts based on some useful material follow: The number of applicable principles increases somewhat at various stages in densities. The learning of these laws and their application allows for evolvement to the next level where there is more to learn, apply and create within experience. Law of Attraction (what you give is what you get) Law of Intention (placing intent in creation of new experience) Law of Allowance (releasing control and manipulation of beings and experience) Law of Harmony and Balance (that which manifests when the others are applied) Law of Attraction. Simply stated, like attracts like. The law of attraction magnetizes the object of the focused thought that was \"sent out into the creational field of energy\" and it is returned to the point of origin. When the point of origin is vibrating at the slower rate, it appears within the sequential time orientation to manifest very slowly. It is essential to understand the law of attraction in order to apply the law of allowance. The composite of thoughts, opinions and attitudes of each individual generate the experience patterns of living. Through the flow of daily experiences these are filtered through this composite of each one’s total collective experience. In this way the pattern or matrix is in a dynamic and fluid process. When attitudes and opinions are deliberately programmed within a limited set of rigid guidelines, the activity level of the total pattern of experience begins to slow. The key is the word deliberately. This means that the guidelines are imposed, not by the individual through knowledge experienced into wisdom but by the beliefs imposed on the individual by those he/she considers outside authorities. The pattern of each individual as a whole attracts to itself life experiences that resonate in harmony with that pattern. If a person desires some thing or some experience that does not resonate with that pattern, it is difficult, if not impossible to attract it. Two divergent patterns cannot blend cohesively. A child is born into its family situation, or lack of one, in innocence, except for inherited genetic coding. It is totally influenced in its experience by the same thoughts, attitudes and opinions of its parents until it is old enough to begin to attract some of its own experiences. Eventually it graduates to its own field of attraction, but the pattern of its matrix is already present. The direct influence of the family is present to the degree of acceptance of those thoughts, attitudes and opinions by the maturing individual. The physical attributes present also contribute to the attitudes that develop during the maturation process. Parental, teacher and peer influences all play their part. More layers of influence are present. The thoughts, attitudes and opinions of groups input to the individual matrix. Identities within ethnic, neighborhood, city, region, state, nation, etc, add their influence. Next add the conscious and subconscious programming by radio, TV, movies, newspapers, magazines, and on-line information. Each of these composite patterns is received and filtered through thought, opinion and attitude to create the individual resonating matrix.

In the case of the existing Game, it requires the total inclusion of those involved. It does not matter what the thoughts are as long as they support the plan. Complicity involves believing the intent of those involved is for the good of all. Perhaps now you can see the power of sympathy for the afflicted ones around your globe. This supports the victim consciousness that is required, for it is complicity in disguise. Do you not consider them victims of war or natural disaster or poverty? You must take a deep breath, accept your part in bringing support to their feelings of victimhood. They too have responsibility in the creation of those situations. Your sympathy will not solve their misery. Your deliberate choice to create a new paradigm of experience will do that. Withdrawing your focus of attention and bringing it toward creating a new experience will bring the change about far more quickly than repeatedly sending aid while considering them poor innocent victims. Does this sound hard hearted? From our point of view, it is hard hearted to be part of the creation of these horrendous situations in the first place. You must deliberately choose to implement your desire to create a whole new experience for them as well as yourselves. When you choose to place your intent beyond the play perceived by the 5 senses, and place it instead into the creation of a new experience, you are withdrawing your consent and support of the experience in which you no longer wish to participate. You are using the second Law of the Universe. If you simply focus on change then expect chaos within your life for that will be the change you create until you decide upon some more precise idea of what you want in your experience. The process of how this works involves a Universal Law called Attraction. •The key is not in acting out resistance to the current apparent situation, circumstance and apparent events, but in focusing on the desired outcome. The act of holding the desired outcome within the emotions of desire and idea of the outcome is the application of the Law of Allowance. This is the most difficult of all of the Laws to apply, for the events that are happening will still reflect the expression of the established process until the focus of the desired outcome is beginning to influence the total picture. Thus it is important to find positive attributes in the current experience to appreciate and honor even as a new paradigm of experience is desired. This is the paradox that is found through out creation. In order to have what is new, it is necessary to honor aspects of what is present as a stepping stone on which to stand before creating a new stepping stone to continue the progress. To honor something does not make it necessary to carry it on into the next phase. Again it is necessaiy to point out that the grateful heart reflects a feeling aspect that resonates with the Law of Attraction that brings into experience more for which to be grateful. It is the way it works. Victim consciousness is the epitome of the negative experience. It draws through the law of attraction like energy, or in other words it draws situations that exploit that consciousness. 563"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"There are few within the \"modern societal norm\" that do not know at least one man or woman that in the scenario of several marriages repeats the same pattern of abused/abuser relationships. The pattern of the victim draws the abuser, whether physical or verbal, no matter how many times a new partner enters the picture. This is especially true if the relationships quickly follow each other. The pattern of experience is held in place by the thoughts, attitudes and opinions that are at the basis of self-awareness. The victim desires to be rescued. Someone or some event must come and change their life. If however, there is time taken to consider and contemplate the elements of the situation resulting in changes of attitude and opinion (knowledge to wisdom) the pattern of experience can change. The tragedy of religious teachings of an outside primal source as a personified rescuer is that it not only instills a victim consciousness, but also feeds it. A victimized personified deity hanging on a cross as a status of veneration draws to those believers what they venerate, the victim experience. If poverty is venerated, poverty is attracted. If hard work is venerated, then life will be filled with hard work. If killing is venerated, then death is attracted. What ever the dominant focus of thought, attitude, and opinion, is will influence the overall matrix and dominate the attraction of experience. There is a great difference in the application and concepts of wanting, believing and knowing. Wanting only creates more wanting, believing only says that one thinks the process will work, while “knowing” accomplishes the intention. It is the degree of difference that the actual experience of “seeing” the application work that allows for the “knowing” to become accepted and applied with ease. The first attempts at application must be reasonable and believable in order to reach the “knowable” level of acceptance. The nuances of these concepts are important to contemplate. The understanding that deliberately applying the concepts of these laws may not be an easy task in the beginning. Thus to choose a single application with which to test the theories is of primary importance. It is the habit of man to want everything at once and to fail to take a new process slowly and deliberately. The learning of the application of the Laws is much like stringing beads, one at a time. What is challenging is to hold the concept to be manifested clearly in mind without adding nuances to it that complicate and slow or in fact halt, the entire process because of unnecessary detail. Again, thought thinks and often creates a far more grand application than the finite mind can conceive. The energies of the individual begin to change as intention and the ability to hold an intention clearly strengthens and holds firm. It would be expected that one or more successes in manifesting a desired outcome would firmly integrate the process into the experience. However, that does not seem to be the case. Most find that old habits and assumptions do not disappear from the experience easily. It takes many successes to raise the acceptance level to create a habit level for natural manifestation. There also are the instances when casual thought manifests as the sub-conscious applies the Laws to these casual thoughts. It is possible to bring into experience instances that apply to others that were never intended. Therefore the statement “of highest and best good for all concerned” is the best possible safety insurance and would be wisely added to all intentions to manifest a desire. A consistent sprinkling of this statement within the continual mind chatter that fills the void between meaningfully aware thoughts is also wise. To meaningfully apply the Laws of Attraction, Focused Intent and Allowance requires purposeful desire to bring something into real experience. The simple experience unhampered by unnecessary add-on details is possible to manifest quite quickly, depending M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

The degree of “knowing” is the final ingredient in the mix. It is difficult to determine the difference between believing and knowing. Again, it is an easy, almost effortless application of the desire, just as you know you can move from the chair to the door. There is an application of the doing of it that is totally without doubt and a knowing of exactly where one is going, but no thought as to exactly what the muscular and other bodily efforts are that are involved, or what may happen during the process of arriving at the door. It is also necessary to continue to “know” one is going to the door all the way to getting there. Losing the focus may allow one to end up in the kitchen and wonder why they are there. In the same way, it is not necessary to delineate what is necessary in order for the desire to manifest. It is only necessary to know what the desire is and to add the minimal amount of focused cooperation that is necessary to set the process in motion while holding the intention of experiencing the desire. It is often mentioned that one needs to be sure one really wants what one thinks is wanted. Most can think of casual thoughts or statements that have brought experiences with consequences not expected. The creative aspect built into all is listening and takes those thoughts and statements literally, especially if the momentary intention is sincere and supported by emotional impetus. While the explanation seems complicated, the application is quite simple. It is a matter of simply doing it simply. The complicated part is when doubt slows or destroys the effort entirely. To begin by choosing a desire that is totally contrary to the current experience is to set up a formula for failure. To attempt to move from poverty to affluence with one desire is sure to fail. It is best to begin with something small and simple. It adds to the process to act as if the desire is already happening. Place an empty hanger in the closet for the new coat. Make space in the cupboard for a new dish or pot, etc. Then be patient and wait expectantly. In considering the picture from a linear event observational mode, timing seems inordinately important. Within the understanding that a picture of wholeness can be filled in by events and circumstances that do not appear to be happening in a sequential mode, it is difficult for those participating to ascertain and comprehend the larger picture. Without understanding accomplishments as they fit within the bigger picture, it requires great self discipline to hold the desired outcome firmly in intentional focus. It is because the increasing inflow of newly awakening awareness requires those of greater understanding to constantly redefine the purpose and the intent. This then in turn refreshes and renews their own focus. From an energetic pattern point of view, this provides for a spiraling of greater available dynamism. Law of Allowance. The law of allowance is the most difficult of the three active or dynamic universal laws to accept as necessary and to practice. It is essential to understand the law of attraction in order to apply the law of allowance. The composite of thoughts, opinions and attitudes of each individual generate the experience patterns of living. Through the flow of daily experiences these are filtered through this composite of each one’s total collective experience. In this way the pattern or matrix is in a dynamic and fluid process.

By honoring what is. the Law' of Attraction is invoked. • The law of allowance reflects the release of the need to control through allowance changes the perception profoundly. It allows transcendence from responsibility for others and recognizes the personal choice of releasing them to their own personal decisions. Rather than bringing forth feelings of separation, this blessing process brings forth an experience of a form of love that has blessed them in a way that will have profound effects on their life. In adversarial situations, a change may take several repetitions, but it will bring change. •The law of allowance is more difficult to perceive because of the degree of control exercised individually and by outside psychological (including religious) and technological mind manipulations. It is indeed, difficult for most of mankind to actually have and/or maintain a sovereign attitude. The opportunity to live life with freedom of choice and be allowed to observe and learn from the results of those choices is rare. To declare the desire to do so is incorporated within the desire for a new paradigm of experience. •The practice of discernment is part of the application of the Law of Allowance The discerning individual will find it necessary to logically assess their attitudes and opinions. Are they judgmental and blaming of others? Are there always reasons that the self is not responsible for what is going on in the life experience? If so, then denial of personal responsibility is blocking all progress and the cycle of victim hood is established. Until such time as this can be looked at with logic and the pattern discerned, it remains locked into the experience. It is necessary to desire to change these basic controlling factors, look and listen to what is thought and said and purposefully change the basic pattern. The results will take time and diligent correction in order to see the changing pattern in experience. However, the pattern must change if the intent and purpose are held in focus and thought and words are changed. Statements made can be restated in a positive mode, this then changes the first statement. Thoughts can be “re-thought.” Simple as this message content is, there are few if any who cannot find application of these ideas in their daily experience. The practice of discernment is an ongoing focus through many levels of experience. Looking within at attitudes, opinions, statements and thoughts often reveals interesting and applicable causes. Each is encouraged to apply these suggestions in an ongoing fashion. Discernment is further practiced in considering and choosing what information is true. It is a wise practice to set up the discernment process by stating in thought that one wishes to discern truth before listening, watching or reading. In that way the mind discards what is not true and retains what, if anything contained, is true. What is truth for one is not always truth for another. Each pattern of experience sets up a different ability to glean what is necessary to know. It is encouraged that this suggestion be used when reading these messages. •What is called patience is allowance. Here a nuance must be understood. There is a difference between tolerance and patience. The difference can best be described by the emotion that is felt. This is an especially fruitful opportunity for self-contemplation. Tolerance carries an emotional charge of resentment while patience is usually accompanied by heartfelt anticipation, even amusement, by the observer. There is a very profoundly observable difference between tolerance and patience. This is a difference that can be M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

It is this type of conscious decision that promotes the transcendence of knowledge into wisdom through the conscious choice to rise above one emotion into the other by giving up an attitude and an opinion. With out releasing what is causing the resentment, no transition of attitude can be made. In the human experience, it is noted that release of tolerance into patience is often accompanied by physical smiling. Law of Harmony and Balance: There is a fundamental call within each for balance. The lack of ability to choose experiences freely causes a distortion of energy pattern that brings intuitional discomfort and searching to change that feeling. This need is then' lead into unending streams of unfulfilling pursuits by those who would change the destiny of this planetary experience. Those changes that will lead to the establishment of balance and harmony receive input of supporting energy that strengthens and hastens the process. In Conclusion: It is in learning to rely on the self-awareness to perceive where each is within the application and understanding of these laws that underlie all of manifested reality. That will replace the programmed need to look outside to some power greater than self for the gift of permission to do something or to fulfill a desire. It is up to the self to attain that desire through the application of those laws for the self and in cooperation with others. Thought properly intended thinks and acts through to completion if properly held in mental and emotional focus for positive change. Focus is “lightly” held by the mind. If you intend for your body to move from one room to the other, it simply does by acting on your intentional motivation for it to do so. It acts entirely within the Universal Law of Intention into manifested action. It is not even a conscious thought, it is an intended action, and it happens. The subtlety of this example demonstrates the power of intention that is “lightly held” but is yet confidently expected to happen. It would be well for this example to be contemplated and carefully understood. Through the coordinated and integrated action of the first three Laws of the Universe, the 4th Law of Harmony and Balance will manifest into reality. This is not to say that there are no polarity experiences within the Law of Balance and Harmony. Indeed there are, however, there is not the extremes of experience leading to great imbalance. These are merely lessons of discernment that demonstrate knowledge lived into wisdom. The Universal Laws when properly invoked can bring about wondrous changes in situations that otherwise would remain stuck within their current motion and momentum. This remarkable process results in complete re-arrangement of energetic forces that are in motion. This causes a period of chaotic energy shifting but can happen quickly if it is released (allowed) to complete the process without the input of imposed restrictions to its motion by the “intender” by continually adding thoughts to. the process on how the Laws must bring about the desired focus. It is this necessary release/allowance that is the key. The educational process has brought mankind many blessings, but it has also allowed for great limitations. Internet: A simple internet search will bring you to a place where you can download the Handbook for a New Paradigm, if you are interested. Search for the title name. From the Handbook: ...“The desire to ‘rescue the suffering’ will be great and examples of victims will be within victim consciousness. The observer mode of allowance, while the new paradigm focus manifests and brings the ultimate solution to their plight, must be held securely at the forefront of the conscious awareness. If dropped, it must be quickly picked up. Looking at or recalling a meaningful symbol is the easiest way to regain the focus.

Each must look within themselves to determine if their evolvement and genetic adaptation is such that a commitment of this magnitude is possible, plausible and noble enough to find out if the traits of character necessary are available or not. It is certain that each one that commits will find out!” When the time comes for each of you to stand forth in your own truth, it is then that you will know how committed you are to creating the new paradigm of experience, Until such a crisis time, you will not know who and what you are. Each desires to be the most it is possible to be, but desire and actuality are two entirely different realities. Thus, it is time to turn attention from the planetary focus to the personal realm. The mode of experience as perceived by humans on your planet is a reality that limits the ability of most to encompass an overview of the current happenings. When this is further limited by the currently ‘normal’ linear method of discerning what is acknowledged as “believable”, the distortion disallows any ability to comprehend an accurate picture. The media misinterpretation and omission of accurate information further complicates the situation. It is from this vantage point of the human dilemma that the cognizant ones can understand their fellow inhabitants. Each can remember they were just as unaware and uninformed about the current world circumstances. Once the distortion is acknowledged, then it becomes apparent that somehow a clearer image of what is “really” true is necessary in order to begin to change the momentum that is threatening to steam-rill what progress has influenced and motivated the desire for real freedom to consciously evolve. While these comparatively few individuals endeavor to reach out and inform their friends, relatives and associates, it is their intent to do this that brings about the results. Their intent draws to them the appropriate contacts and situations that allow for these important exchanges of information. This permits each to comprehend their own new picture of what they are able to perceive. Both emotional and logical constraints influence the understanding that each then uses as a basis for further interpretation of information. These either extend or limit the newly identified picture. By comprehending that a false and distorted representation has been purposely overlaid to cover the true situation, what becomes important is the decision as to what to do about this revelation. It is easiest to just play the waiting game and watch what happens. There is a difference between watching, and observing ! Watching indicates a total withdrawal that has no intentional reason for becoming aware other than curiosity. Observing is done for the reason of using the knowledge gained for an intentional purpose. While you are encouraged to cultivate the practice of being in the observer mode, it is also important that it be understood that this is not an inactive role. The keen observer is cognizant of the scene and his/her place within it, as well as how it coincides with previously known information and its effect on. the larger known aspects of the current reality. There will, in times to come, be opportunities to make appropriate input to situations that will change the total outcome of an entire well-planned event. Just as removing a pin will cause the failure of a vital piece of equipment, a simple logical statement can change an attitude or perspective that affects how or if a person will act within a given situation. As has been mentioned before, accepting one logical statement into one’s belief system can cause a total realignment of that belief system. In a moment of realization the entire picture of understanding can change.

Recommended Resources and Useful Developments The Best of the Best for Those in an Evolutionary Spiral Personal Unified Field Device to Modulate or Interfere With Electromagnetic Mind Control Radiation Patterns In the past few years, a few protective devices that can retard, attenuate (weaken) or change the character of electromagnetic radiation effecting the human body have emerged. The most popular early device was the Teslar Watch originally developed by Dr. Andreas Puharich. It was effective against most electromagnetic fields, but not against tactical or psychoactive electromagnetic signals, the \"imaginary\", \"etheric\" component of alternating (time, phase) electrical.systems. The drawback with the Teslar Watch was that it had to be sent to the factory for battery replacement. Other products which emerged on to the market were somewhat effective, but they all needed batteries - the drawback was that the protective effect which resulted from projection of a field of specific pulsing EMF wavered or weakened proportionally to the state of the battery. Recently, the so-called \"tachyon\" glass beads and jewelry appeared on the market — none of them claimed to relate to our relationship with the mind and behavior altering fields that surround us. They were not designed for that purpose. Furthermore, these glass beads could not have produced tachyonic energy, because tachyonic energy can only exist within a Unified Field , because only within a Unified Field can superluminal (faster than light) particles exist. These glass beads probably radiated so-called \"soft electrons\" for a period of time - they were advertised as relating to strength and vitality of the wearer. The production of takvons (the original Greek spelling) occurs as a result of precise processes using both pulsing EMF and controlled atmospheric vacuum heat treatments in regard to the components forming the Unified Field Devices, as well as magnetic annealing and precipitation hardening treatments of special alloys (which are also used in the aircraft industry). Without these critical processes and parameters relative to the construction of these devices, there is no way to produce unified field processes and takyonic radiation of specific frequencies and hyperspatial components designed to counteract much of the psychoactive and mind altering electromagnetic environment. We categorically state that takyons can only exist in a Unified Field , and/or a Bio-Field, for otherwise, per Einstein, no real-mass particles of signals can travel faster than 186,000 miles per second. Without unified field takvons (not Tachyons), there is no protective field against these frequencies. 569"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group, All Rights Reserved. M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition What is a Unified Field? How Does the Device Work? A unified field is a field in which all energies are in a state of unification. It is a field in which magnetic, electrical, gravitational, strong/weak nuclear, thermal, acoustical and other radiative attributes are in a state of mathematical, geometric and harmonic unification. They are not de-coupled, separate or broken down into radiative attributes. It is based on Einstein’s modified equation E = me 2 * 0 c 2 , based on E = me 2 , where © is the consciousness constant. It means a shift from Special Relativity to General Relativity by accelerating energy to reach the Bohm Superquantum-Relativistic Potential otherwise known as the holographic infinite information continuum, also known as the intelligent field that intei'penetrates the universe. The overall frequency of the unified takyon field that vibrates from the Takyon Capsule is estimated to be in the range between io 68 - 10 98 cycles per second (or chaotic, non-linear oscillations, not Hertz, or symmetrical sine-wave oscillations). The field output contains multiple hyperspatial harmonic phase-modulated frequency overlay patterns which create a phased pulsed interference with psychoactive mind affecting frequencies, molding the generalized natural field structure around the human body into a \"barrel\" shape (see figure) with specific protective characteristics. Because of the process of the generation of the unified field within the device, it is self-pouiering and requires no external power source, not even batteries. The device essentially creates a five-dimensional (x,y,z, time, gravity) hyperbolic tensor field which manifests as a bi-directional hyperspacial Einstein-Rosen bridge. 570"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

It creates a protective force-field approximately 3 feet in diameter when worn around the neck. In terms of field function, it is composed of two (2) counter-rotating Takyon Tensor Fields of very high frequency that functionally \"suck up\", deflect or attenuate (mute) electromagnetic field photons present in ambient electromagnetic frequencies, especially in the psychoactive mind affecting regions, by disorganizing the photonic information-carrying matrix. The capsule on the left has the Radial Amplifier Device (RAD) on top. Actual Size: 1.5 inches long x 0.5 inches diameter (without RAD device). The R-i Radial Amplifier Deflector With the R-i attached to the top of a stationary (not worn) T-i device placed on the floor (zero potential) it restructures the force field emanated by the T-i, increasing its diameter to about 100 feet, which is large enough to protect an entire home or office. This protective force field dome , which is an oblate spheroid (egg-shaped) , is activated through the employment of a protocol implemented through the focused consciousness of the user, using a very simple tensor formula, properly visualized, and directed with will, accompanied by a specific breathing pattern. Bingo! It works! Martial artists are quite adept at this process. This unified field device, previously available to few people, is now available to the general public with a much simpler activating protocol. 0BLA7E lf>HEX0iDALl£66 SHAPl D DQM5, ACTUATION TCWiOR FQKMULK A = C ii vm\\SU k muMiuED SI Ut£l TO SUIT rue M£A 0&W6 PROTECTED, £> = 2R, A * 571"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"Purchasing These Unified Field Devices: The Only Unique Source No Eurocheques, please.

Projects and Developments: More Advanced Thought-Intrusion Protective Devices UNIFIED TAKYONIC TENSOR FORCE FIELDS Over the past several years, work has continued in field analysis, computations and experimentation with designs starting with the T-l device, and great strides have been made toward the development of devices with further advancements. Some of these devices will be made available in the near future, in response to a growing need, due to the complexity and further developments in frequency control technology. Some, beyond what is shown in this book, are available now. We also use this technology at Leading Edge Research Group. Write Dr. Gutierrez for information on the latest developments UTC has available, or visit his web page at: www.trufax.org/takyon/welcome.html for the latest information.

Meadowbrook I have always been a hyper-sensitive person, both to environmental conditions and the energies of other people, conscious and subconscious. My extreme sensitivity, coupled with a genuine interest in metaphysics, have unfolded into a career as a clairvoyant, clairsentient, clairaudient, psychic reader. I seem to have been born with clairvoyance, possibly inherited from my mother’s side of the family, and when at my best, am able to see quite sincerely and precisely. I will jump ahead now and say that, before acquiring my personal Takyon Capsule, clairvoyant readings and discordant environmental situations used to leave me drained and depleted, sometimes physically ill in the solar plexus area. It would take me several days to recover from a “Psychic Fair”, where I did a large number of readings in the course of a few hours. Now, with a good night’s sleep, I am ready to go again. I am also a business woman. I own a metaphysical book and gift shop, “Stargate Books and Gifts”, in Wilmington, North Carolina. Previously, I owned two similar bookstores in Washington state: “The Guiding Star” in Chehalis, and “The Star of Heaven” in Longview. It was approximately 1990 when a customer of “The Guiding Star” introduced myself and my now former husband to the Takyon device, with which he is involved in research and development. Although I can be spontaneous, I tend to be skeptical of opportunities and products that sound “too good to be true”. I am one of the few people I know who have NEVER joined a Multi-level company, as I also receive a negative feeling, at least thus far with the ones that have been offered to me, and did fold. I did not receive a negative or spontaneous reaction to the Takyon capsule. My first reaction was interest and curiosity, followed by a vision of copper, a sense of vibration, and a knowingness that this device had an amazing capability which had nothing to do with its size. At our store, we often held classes, workshops, seminars, and demonstrations. Shortly after receiving our personal Takyon capsules, literature, and information, we invited Mr. Pedro Guiterrez to give a lecture and demonstration at “The Guiding Star”, which included a group experiment involving a hair dryer (which produces ELF’s), kinesiology, and the Takyon. Those exposed to a few seconds of treatment from the hair dryer tested negatively (or weakly, i.e. affected) by the appliance. When wearing a Takyon, 99% of the group were no longer affected by the hair dryer. A large number of individuals in the metaphysical and scientific community shortly purchased their own Takyons. Before wearing mine (I still have the original, and like the Energizer Bunny, it’s still going strong), I used to also have a difficult time entering large areas with mixed energies and flourescent lighting, such as malls, and stores like K-Mart and Wal-Mart. My clairaudience would be activated and I would literally “hear” snatches of conversation from the minds of most of the customers and clerks (and most were not veiy happy, content, or peacefiul). Now, I can shop with little or no hyper-interference, even staying long enough to overspend! The same was true for social gatherings - especially those with a certain agenda and mixed emotions from the individuals present. An example of this would be a wedding reception where the couple have had an engagement full of doubts and fears, and most of those present are aware of this. The emotions would cause me to become ill, even nauseous, before I obtained by Takyon.

Many people, a high percentage of them psychics, will experience migraine headaches until the storm actually breaks and negative ions are released. This was true for me before I had my Takyon, or on the rare occasions I forget it. Now, I still feel the changing energy and a degree of the oppression, but I can continue to function well, and do not receive a migraine. Evidence that the Takyon works for me lies in the fact that whenever I am experiencing frequencies, energies, oversensitivity, weakness, impatience, dizziness, or nausea, I begin a check-list of where these conditions originate. I can truly testify that at least 95% of the time, I discover I am NOT wearing my Takyon, and will often make a trip involving several miles home to retrieve it. Now-1 don’t leave home without it. It would further seem to me that anyone who does not respond to the positive benefits of the Takyon capsule must be insensitive, numbed out by drugs or alcohol (and I believe it could be of help in these areas), or in a state of denial that a Unified Force Field can be created in this manner. It has been my please, especially in the past year, to introduce many people in North Carolina to the Takyon and observe their positive reactions and beneficial results.

Takyon Capsule Sensing I am a visionary reader of psychic phenomenon working with group consciousness, the afterlife, life contracts intuitive reader, an emotional intuitive, and energy worker. I sense various types of energy as different types of “textured” elements of light/color & sound — I see, hear and feel them sometimes as pressure, irritation, or static from ELF, microwave, etc. X-Rays are felt as heat in the thymus/heart area similar to heating/cooking various areas in the body. Microwaves feel like an overall heating (cellular bumping similar to how free radical cells react within the body — bumping into another cell and pitting it and trying to steal and strip away electrons - like a balloon flying around the room erratically expelling the air). Here’s my interaction and sensing of the Takyon while meditating wearing, holding the capsule. (Since 2/15/01) Initial sensing was an uplifting, unifying energy field. I actually felt lifting energy field i’-2’ up off the floor. I actually saw the Takyons as sun sparkling on water, or snow on a TV screen. It felt like the toms field around me was instilled with energetic energy to be activated/released — energy field cleaned-out, and size changed and expanded larger. I saw cohesive geometric energies. There was a gentle percolating bubbling around the starting/activating torus field event that felt protective, safe and bundled. I was directed to use the energy during my meditation to clean up an area along the East coast, and then at a grid point up toward the northwest U.S./Canada, but in upper Earth’s atmosphere, and then I went out and worked Universally with Takyon. These were done because of a sense of being drawn to a place where energy was dissonant & with my intent to change/adjust/fix it was a clear “click” in attention being drawn toward dissonant energy.

The same day he received the capsule for protection, the voices in his head stopped and his sleep improved. The next day he received extensive dental work (removal of huge silver/mercury fillings) plus chelation therapy. To refresh your memoiy, in case you have forgotten me, we spoke several times, and you provided tremendous support for me at that time. Within two months David began working (had not been able to work for nearly 6 years). I no longer support him financially, but continue to send boxes of things he can use). However, he continues to drink. To his dismay it takes less alcohol to affect him... thus he can not drink to excess as in past. I suspect in time his body’s memoiy cells will start rejecting it totally., .since his neivous system may no longer require the excessive self medication. He says he wears the capsule all the time... and at night keeps it by him on dresser, so he must be getting considerable relief from it to continue it’s use. P.M.

I discovered and ordered this amazing product in October 1999, and it’s something you can really grow to appreciate for what it can do for your memoiy, mood, mental processes and how much work you can accomplish with such ease. It’s the only neurological supplement I have ever found anywhere that is completely effective and synergistic, in that it is a combination of nine natural, safe, neurological anti-aging supplements that work together (synergy), supported by a host of vitamins and minerals. There are a million really dumb hyped-up supplements out there, but I haven’t found anything that can surpass what this does for me, and for what I have seen it do for others. The product Brain Lightning comes in a 90 capsule bottle for $69.95, which is a bargain considering what’s in it. ($110 worth of materials).

MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Analysis of the Local 3 rd Density Matrix - The Classics Note from Val: Keep in mind that I have been putting books together for decades, and that my perspective also changes over time with experience. The following books cover the existing cultural (local) matrix, to include information on sequential interaction with the planet and the various technological manipulations in use. Eventually, you must evaluate all these books from the perspective of Matrix V. Like with anything else in life, I was where I was in terms of my ever-shifting perspective at the time I put these together. What books you pick to buy and read will reflect what you need to absorb at the time you do. Let your Higher Self be your guide. Using Matrix V as a Guide for Evaluation of Earth Reality Using Matrix V as a guide, you will be able to more effectively evaluate our other books: (the study of alien/sequential and related polarity activity on Earth- Matrix II), and the implementation of sequential mandates on humans- Matrix III Vol. 1 & 2) and related materials for study of the local Matrix on Earth. Matrix IV (new age paradigms) was closely examined in the light of Matrix V. Rather than an analysis of the game (M2,M3,M3V2), Matrix 4 is now viewed as an inadvertent extension of the game. It was decided that it would be withdrawn from publication in December 2002. It was determined that the M4 lacked current relevance and doesn’t contribute to the advanced, evolving perspectives that reflect our current intent. You will also be able to evaluate ALL books and literature on the planet. They will appear as they really are, with their respective polarity orientation and intent fully exposed. Most Earther literature (and 99% of what’s on the Internet), as you will discover, is a red herring for those seeking who they are, why they’re here, and what it’s like to be outside ‘the box’ of Earther culture and mentality.

Even now, this book is perhaps the most influential piece of work that has ever appeared on the planet on the subject of the alien-human interaction issue. It represents the first major work ever published that demonstrated a no-holds- barred approach to revealing what was really going on with the government, underground bases and alien factions. At the time, a lot of people were in denial that what was in the book could possibly be true. Now, years later, it is commonly recognized as the most forthright examination of many core issues, such as abduction by military and alien factions.

Valerian weaves a wide range of interrelated material into a literary experience that will rock you to the core of your very being - including expansion of your consciousness as a side benefit. Included within the book is a wide-spectrum chronological database, a large section of hypothetical analysis of the alien situation by the Nexus Seven, data and updates on underground bases at Dulce and the Nevada Test Site, a large number of illustrations, maps and charts detailing activity sites, underground installations and tunnel networks, and a commentary by John Lear, Robert Lazar and host of other researchers. Valerian takes us through the gambit of how, why and whom humans are manipulated, information about government connections to the abductions process, post-abduction problems, and the things that the abductee can do. The book is the first to adequately relate research on memory functions relative to the abductions process, virtual reality machines and so-called Reichian programming and mind control by human and alien manipulators. It also discusses the abduction of human children and how to handle the adjustment of the child to the experience, multi- generational abduction scenarios and cases, human multidimensional anatomy and how it can be manipulated by technology. There is more information in this book about the Greys then there is in probably any book existing on the planet, with additional data on the dominant reptilian species. There are implant devices, as well as technical data gleaned from analysis of both government and alien implant devices during 1991. This book is the death-knell for planetary domination systems and its accompanying social control systems (which are expanded on in Matrix III). It spells the end of classical \"ufology\" with its attendant \"ufologists\". Through this book, we can see how alien interaction has affected wave after wave of civilization on this planet, injecting elements of adverse technology and mind control (again expanded on in Matrix III), and how the suppression of human awareness is being performed and supported. Matrix II is an absolute must to have in your library. Read M5 first for a real appreciation of M2.

Matrix III Volume One begins the discussion on electromagnetics with a review of the natural electromagnetic fields of the planet, the holographic aspects of the universe and consciousness, the morphological fields set forth by Dr. Rupert Shedrake, and continues on with hard-to-find data on the human brain and neurophysiology, as well as brain structures and their relationship to levels of consciousness and behavior. The psychosocial aspects of human society are discussed in detail, with emphasis on the nature of belief systems, perception, and the socially sanctioned programming involving the ego functions of security, sensation and power. The book discusses four ascending levels of social manipulation, including detailed data on consciousness, genetics, and manipulation of human consciousness from outside the physical realm and beyond. Matrix III Volume One begins the initial discussion of the various elements of population control through the deliberate misuse of biological organisms, all the way from the very concept of disease to the covert production of biological weapons under the guise of various government programs. Incredible data. There are sections discussing biological warfare, a beginning treatise on the nature of the immune system (carried to further detail in the second volume), a short review of the paradigm of vaccination (also brought into deeper focus in the second volume), a discussion of the spread of neural fungi, zoonotic diseases and veterinary biology, viruses (both human and non-human), and revealing data on who runs the major drug and chemical companies and just how interconnected it all is. The section on electromagnetic mind control in Matrix III Volume One has no equal anywhere in the world. The groundwork is covered in relation to the use of the electromagnetic spectrum, the deliberate historical suppression of the hyperspacial nature of electromagnetics (the so-called Hertzian Conspiracy), and a host of data on advanced mind control applications that goes far beyond anything you have ever seen before. It is this material which brought this book into planetary popularity. The book discusses the new electronic networks, the secret behind the use of the cellular telephone systems, mind control projects (two pages of projects are listed), and the manipulation of the earth grid. There is more data on the Montauk projects than any single book in existence, including the individual books released years later. Interspaced with all of this data, there is a host of supplementary material, interviews and revealing information. The NWO plans for total planetary domination, economic and otherwise, are discussed, including plans for a one-world religious control system, the objectives of electronic mind control and the GWEN system, schools of thought contributing to the mind control paradigm, and research.

MATRIX III V0I.2: The Psychosocial, Chemical, Biological and Electromagnetic Manipulation of Human Consciousness Authored by Val Valerian, 1014 pages, index, 8 1/2 by 11 Velo Bound, Leading Edge Research Group, 1995. Matrix III Volume 2 explores the progression of science, biology and sociology into a materialist paradigm and its eventual degradation into political systems which form the basis of all control paradigms, wars and human conflict, and answers the questions: what is the nature of the two paradigms that collided at Waco, Texas? What are the premises that have resulted in continuous ethnic cleansing, genocide, and the development of the allopathic biomedical approach to health? What paradigms must the human civilization embrace if it is to survive? What lessons can human civilization learn from observing nature? Valerian explores these ideas and more, with in-depth discussions of the ideas of Newton, Darwin, Hobbes, Malthus and other influential people, as well as the processes of conversion of these ideas into political, sociological and psychological control systems. For anyone who wonders exactly how Western Civilization ever got into the position it is in today, the answer lies within the pages of this work. This book not only extends the research delineated in the first volume, but constitutes a superbly referenced exploration into the nature of the paradigm itself. Matrix III Volume 2 begins with a review of key people, ideas and belief systems, tracing their development from aborginal times to the present, and the merging of these systems into a Western world view that not only promotes the degradation of the human civilization, but promotes elitism and control-manipulation paradigms which surround use and underlie everything we see around us today. Matrix III Volume 2 explores the progression of science, biology and sociology into a materialist paradigm and its eventual degradation into political systems which form the basis of all control paradigms, wars and human conflict, and answers the questions: what is the nature of the two paradigms that collided at Waco, Texas? What are the premises that have resulted in continuous ethnic cleansing, genocide, and the development of the allopathic biomedical approach to health? What paradigms must the human civilization embrace if it to survive? What lessons can human civilization learn from observing nature? Valerian explores these ideas and more, with in-depth discussions of the ideas of Newton, Darwin, Hobbes, Malthus and other influential people, as well as the processes of conversion of these ideas into political, sociological and psychological control systems. Matrix III Volume 2 then uses its own exploration of the current elements of the paradigm, superbly cited and referenced, to provide absolute proof of the intentionality to follow the ideas and thought patterns discussed at the beginning of the book. After two years of work, this book is perhaps the best technical production to come forth from Leading Edge Research. Despite the common focus on people as the problem, Valerian makes the point that it is the paradigm which needs attention, the same paradigm superficially examined at Nuremberg but left to fester and expand into a network of suppression fostered by global socialism, the basic cause of human suffering worldwide. Valerian includes in the work a linear analysis of chronologically parallel developments, over 200 pages long, which serve to illustrate the integration of various modes of subversion of the human civilization over the last 1,500 years. The main body of the book, over 700 pages, discusses the implementation of the paradigm, and includes information in one volume that you would normally find in a dozen works. MA TRIX V: The Gold Edition 580"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"Matrix III Volume 2 is broken down into about 19 major chapters, and several large appendices. It includes a fairly large section on biological effects of electromagnetic fields, itself with about 200 references, an appendix with over 100 media exhibits, and of course the master chronology. It also includes the now world-famous Conversations With Research Scientists. Chapter headings include Production of Mass Behavioral and Neurological Problems Using Vaccination to Increase Social Control, Gulf War Syndrome and Other Biological Problems, and Transition from Mechanistic to Quantum Society. This work, which is over 375,000 words, seems to make the point that, in the words of Valerian, “we need a New World Community, not a New World Order.” It makes it quite evident that the planetary population has been led astray by a sequence of false scientific assumptions, what the assumptions are, and, following the example of nature and ideas suppressed, what the true nature of society needs to be in order to transcend and survive the current planetary crisis. One easily comes to the conclusion that this second volume of Matrix III embodies knowledge that you could not accumulate through 50 other books, if you could get hold of them. It is a searing examination of the psycho-social, biological, and medical paradigms being falsely promoted as the only definitive reality for public consumption. If you know people who seem to think that answers lie totally in political and religious belief systems, genetics, violence, or just need to get it together in record time, this book is a must. Valerian points out that the coming paradigm, which is quantum-based and mirrored by the works of Deepak Chopra, David Bohm and Rupert Sheldrake (covered in Volume One), depends entirely upon the realization of the true nature of the universe and that this realization will displace the perverse paradigm now governing the planetary population. From another perspective, seen in Matrix IV, this eventually transpires, but it could well be that Matrix III Volume 2 is one of the works that contributes toward this end. Now, the paradigm covered by Matrix III is embodied in 1,931 pages, in two volumes, and is an absolute must to have in your library, if you wish to totally comprehend the reality in which we are living, and where we must go as a civilization. $66 Postpaid (USA), $82 Postpaid (Canada, Mexico), $112 Postpaid (Other).

Edited and footnoted by Val Valerian. For almost six years, a select group of world scientists also on the path of self-knowledge and discovery began to transmit fascinating information to Leading Edge Research Group in regard to technological developments occurring behind the scenes in the planetary control paradigm, as well as new developments occurring in other facets of society, covered in annual meetings, primarily in Chicago, Illinois but also in New York and other locations around the world. The information first began to appear in the Leading Edge Research Journal in 1993, where the group introduced themselves to readers and then embarked on a series of revelations that began to evoke a lot of interest in the research community. In 1995, when more of the series was released in LE Journal No.78, the contents literally rocked people all over the world, revealing developments in manipulative electromagnetics and mind control suspected but never actually verified until that time.

A 70,ooo-word white paper and research tool, with more than 850 entries, master index, and reference bibliography. The Analytical Chronology of Fluoridation is the result of the examination of thousands of letters, monographs, scientific documents and declassified materials from the National Archives. Through the use of these materials it goes on to prove, by definition, that the fluoridation paradigm is a civil conspiracy participated in by agencies all the way from the US Public Health Service, the World Health Organization, the AMA and ADA, and all state health departments, and that the fluoridation paradigm is based on false science, misrepresentation and deliberate falsehood in order to provide a means for dumping hazardous wastes from industry into the food and water without challenge from the population. This 189 page, 70,000 word piece of work took hundreds of hours to compile and analyze, and is backed up by numerous references and a superb index for locating those hard-to-find statements by the AMA and ADA who, before 1945, told the scientific truth about the nature of fluorides, chemicals more toxic than lead and arsenic. If you are interested in the fluoridation paradigm and what it is doing, and want to have a definitive guideline and a comprehensive view of activity in order to assist you to evaluate current and future activity, this work is invaluable. $26.00 postpaid (USA) $36 postpaid (Canada, Mexico), $43 Postpaid (Other).

Considering the enormous amount of material that surrounds this subject, you have really done a remarkable job!\" -- Albert W. Burgstahler, Ph.D. (Harvard), University of Kansas, Professor of Organic Chemistry, January 31, 1998, author, \"Fluoridation: The Great Dilemma\", Coronado Press, 1978, past co-editor of the scientific journal Fluoride, and former president of the International Society for Fluoride Research. \"The Analytical Chronology of Fluoridation tells the bizarre stoiy of fluoridation from its earliest beginnings to the time of publication. There is no concealment of the bias of the author - the opposing of fluoridation and those who promote the. process. Its forte is the documentation of the ruthlessness of the promoters of fluoridation and the. possible motives behind the movement. It documents the use of U.S. taxpayers' dollars to subvert individuals and institutions to promote fluoridation not only in the United States and Canada, but also overseas. It also presents, in abridged form, the evidence that fluoridation does not improve oral health but is associated with appreciable harm. The index and extensive bibliography provides a unique resource. It is must reading for those who may come face-to-face with the powerful elite to continue to wage a war on behalf of fluoridation.\" -- (June 1998) Richard A Foulkes, M.D., former Executive Director of the Royal Columbian Hospital in New Westminster, B.C MATRIX V: The Gold Edition Quest of the Spirit - The Ultimate Frontier © 2000-2003 Leading Edge International Research Group.

M A TRIX V: The Gold Edition Bonus: Special Post-Production Segment The First Experiential Loop - Part II [Part I of this segment is on page 357. This post-production segment will be particularly important to those who have the Gold Edition since this builds on the original segment. This segment has also been posted in the observations section of the M5G website.] After a Higher Self tires of what Bob Monroe referred to as his original \"home\", the Higher Self breaks the experiential loop concerning the original \"home\" experience and looks for something more. This can involve considerable wandering and searching. Remember that all decisions are made solely by each Higher Self. No one tells them what they have to do. A young Higher Self will eventually encounter the 3rd density Game scenarios played in various galaxies. More about this is contained in M5 Gold. The Higher Self can examine all the various forms of the 3rd density Game and, if so desiring, will choose one that shim would like to ’play' in. Without exception, the Game is started on the sequential path. This is where the Higher Self can gain basic experiences in 3rd density. The sequential Higher Selves cluster together in huge groups depending on which piece they play in the Game. The reptilian Higher Selves are hanging together, for example. They are so close together that, if you were to look at these Higher Selves, they would look like a huge sheet of small bubble wrap laid out flat. Remember that each sequential incarnation has one Higher Self. That's a LOT of Higher Selves. They chose one of the sequential groups because the group hanging together is similar to the group activities of Monroe's original \"home\". The reptilians are the green pieces on the Game board. The Pleiadians are the yellow pieces. The Sirians are the brown pieces and so on. These are only tags I am giving them for this segment to illustrate the differences in sequential participants. Due to the single incarnation at a time and the grouping together, they progress extremely slowly as a unit. This illustrates that groups slow you down when you limit your progression to theirs. This goes on for billions of years. Then, just as with the original \"home\" scenario that Monroe described, certain Higher Selves became bored with the routine and tediously slow experiential loops of the sequential path. ’There HAS to be something more', they think. This is when several of the group Higher Selves break off from their groups and this includes ALL sequential groups. These Higher Selves search for more. This is when they discover the simultaneous path. When the simultaneous path was opened in the Game, it coincided with the Orion/Sirian genetic scientists' experiments on Earth and the splitting of Ancient Earthers into two genders. This was the opening for the simultaneous experience. Refer to M5 Gold for more information on this. More restless Higher Selves left the overly crowded sequential clusters and moved to the simultaneous area. These became a new piece in the Game, the gold piece, for example, however their numbers are extremely small compared to the astronomically high numbers of sequential Higher Selves. Those Higher Selves who choose to remain in the slow, sequential path know about the simultaneous path but have not yet overcome their fears of operating independently and breaking the experiential loops of the sequential path. Safety in numbers is their motto. We will get there 011 our own time. This is a valid approach for them. For Higher Selves who want more, they move to the simultaneous path. The move from sequential to simultaneous is permanent, but it doesn’t keep the occasional sequential from attempting to try an influence a former 'team' member to try and return even though it is impossible. This usually occurs with contactees and their alien visitors telling them how they were once one of them. This does not enhance the contactee but rather adds a new experiential loop to their simultaneous experiences. Misery loves company applies to these Higher Selves acting to derail a former team member. Instead of encouraging them to Advance, they attempt to slow them down. This is also another factor in the Game."}]
