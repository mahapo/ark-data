In the exigent face of worldwide poverty, exploitation and widespread brutalism, in confron- tation with the clutching need to effect a halt and even reversal of the fateful damage done the earth-lungs of the rainforest and the atmospheric epidermis of the ozone layer, what can be so \"hold-the-presses\" pressing about the requirements of an abstract consideration such as that of the paradigm? After all, what is a \"paradigm\"? Isn't it merely the remote requirement of updated theory, sufficiently all-purpose to loan itself to the obscure broodings of a variety of academic disciplines about which the public couldn't be less concerned, except where it incidentally shows in some consumer good or service? Indeed when such an \"academic\" subject does manage to bleed into the peripheries of public perception it tends to be interpreted, by \"New Age\" popularization, as a kind of Big Theory mystically granting grand overviews and magic-carpet rides to the outskirts of the Possible. At the same time it takes on a mythic cast, by virtue of that very flow-line *hereby the public acquires the notion obliquely from the academic cloister; \"paradigm\" is always something that seems to beneeded, a goal of aspiration like the grael-cup, and is never something which is conveniently present and accounted for (i.e. as \"theory\" it retains an aura of remote abstraction, eternally over-the-horizon of those shared fields of refractory experience). Interestingly enough, it would seem that in the Strange Case of the Paradigm the dim and dissolving lines actually obtaining between highbrow, lowbrow and lumpen have seen this popularized interpretation (equating \"paradigm\" with \"theory\") leak right back into the academic and scientific community thereby appreciably affecting the very grasp of those traditionally expected to be pollinators of the paradigm. Tap an academic on the shoulder these days, and he's quite liable to give the New Age \"definition\" in response to the query \"what k a paradigm?\" \"Why it's the Big Theory, the Grand Viewpoint, the New Worldview-you know, like Darwinism, like relativity, like Freudianism. In the one case the theovs 'survival of the fittest', in the other 'E=M~,' and 'the Oedipal Complexi. It's a great Idea in which facts that didn't fit well in the former context are made to feel at home, indeed may be cordially considered essential.\" So our academic, our member-in-good-standing of the priesthood of particle physicists or molecular biologists, takes up the torch of Paradigm with noblesse oblige on behalf of the public scarcely noticing the flambeau has been returned to him considerably modified from its short public loan. In falling absent-mindedly into conformance with the aggregate public (i.e. New Age) notion, however, our academic is inadvertently committing a very fatefulpetitioprincipii. He is assuming precisely what has to be proved; he's putting the proverbial cart before the proverbial horse. How so? Watch That Middle Step: It's a Whopper As with all good professionals in any field, the professionals of the life- and political- and technical sciences (once sensing some rewardable premium has been placed upon the production of a"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"targetedvalue) erupt in an intramural frenzy of competition sending every selfqualified aspirant to the boards to ink-in that definitive Paradigm. Sliding right along on the lubricating feed-back distortion of the popularizing Psyche, the concept of Paradigm merges seamlessly into the standard notion of Theory, even for those specialists from whose fields the term was first appropriated. The trouble is, Paradigm is not the equivalent of Theory. To take \"theory\" for \"paradigm\" is, as we shall see, the same as deleting the most important step in a linear equation. To derive a theory one must first have a pattern or Model to which the theory is to apply. The theory must solve for the model. Yet such a pattern Is the Paradigm. Paradigm indicates the sufficient Model; it gives the indispensable example in the fit place. Why is this so important? Let's go back to our competitive academicians, our professional theorists. Each wishes to produce that Great Theory, the one-piece key that will command all the tumblers of the Lock at once so that apparently-refractory areas of existence may be related to a common term solving for them all, and indeed which allows their actual relationships to catalyze the Resolution. Implicit in this driving desire (whether for \"inner\" or \"outer\" reward, we need not say) is the taken-for-granted assumption that the current in-use theories are indeed inadequate. Darwinism, relativity, quantum mechanics, the Will-to-power or Oedipal Complex are all in themselves too narrow and specialized to fit the inflationary picture of proliferating complexities, the stretched canvas of creaking contradictions progressively painting a moribund portraiture from real-life consequences of those separate shortcomings. On the basis of this taken-for-granted inadequacy of all present theories, however, our Ivy-league rowing teams are preoccupiedly busy hard-stroking toward the golden shore of new theories; their whole endeavor is based on the business of drawing alongside and boarding that great replace- ment-theory, all the while chanting the cadence of \"Paradigm\". In so doing, of course, they're calling upon the very name of that which they've unceremoniously thrown overboard, to popular plaudits. The reason for this is that, by failing to honor the \"separate reality\" of Paradigm as catalyzing Model, they continue to draw up theories against the implicit background of the old pattem on which those confessedly inadequate theories were originally based. In the field of Superstrings, for example, the antfarm of theoretical physicists continues to interpret its equations against the conventional back- ground of \"spacetime\", rather than rechecking the overall pattem implicitly rotated a notch by the introduction of \"strings\" so as to account for the emergence of spacetime by the theory. An important factor in the whole equation of delivering a full-term Weltanschauung to the impatiently-awaiting world is therefore chronically skipped-over, indeed not even noticed due to so convenient yet critical a truncation whereby the \"intelligentsia\" rushes to register a conclusion'before it has satisfactorily considered thepremise. For what is essential to a theory is that it fit the \"present\" facts no matter how refractory, as well as \"facts\" which may be generated on the implications of the theory. This symmetry between theory and facts is blithely ignored, by improperly compassing the whole process through the unwarranted equivalency between \"Theory\" and what was originally meant by \"Paradigm\" (indeed what gave \"paradigm\" its distinguishing definition in the first place). Involved in the question of \"theory\", then, are the facts to which it must fit; but this necessarily involves a working typology of \"reality\" in order to determine what qucrlfm for a \"fact\" in the first place--i.e. what is indeed teal so that it must be accounted for by the Theory. All hustling little competitors in the field rush to squeeze \"paradigm\" into the conceptual Bottle of theory where the Genie of refractory reality may be satisfactorily captured. \"Parndigm\" tends therefore to be the eliminated (yet no-less-necessary) step in the process, displacing the difficult matter of \"reality\" onto the outcome of the ultimate \"theory\" that would deme it. By calling the theory the Paradigm, we seem to evade the requirement sticking out like a sore thumb in the true definition of \"paradigm\"."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The term, after all, was originated to mean something very specific-it emerged into the vocabulary for a putpose. Avoiding its specific implications by capitulating to the \"popular\" (i.e. New Age) lead of marrying it through synonym to \"theory\",'accounts in large part for the manifest inadequacy of every Grand Theory feverishly brought forward in the closing decades of this century so as to effectively unite the world's myriad problem-zones to a resolving Common Denominator. But one can't \"kill two birds with one stone\" in this way, when all that's in one's slingshot is a clump of loose dirt. When we turn to ask why all the king's horses and all the king's men can only put together (so far) a clump of loose dirt, all we need do is refer back to the missing term, the essential mediate step that constitutes all the creativeground in the production of any true theory, which has stood and always will stand beneath the pinnacle of any Resolving Worldview as the magnificent Mountain on which the ultimate Perspective of that view was laboriously and creatively raised. Here is the beginning of our recovery of that all-but-lost Meaning of \"paradigm\"; this proverbial Lost Word is indeed fit of all a linguistic tenn. Conjugating the Lost Word Resorting to the expedient everyone seems to have forgotten along the way, we may recover its \"misty root-origin\" by the esoteric means of consulting a dictionazy-at which enlightening point we'll come to find that \"paradigm\" is actually a term indicating grammatical inflection: it refers to the declension of nouns, pronouns and adjectives, and to the conjugation of verbs. It establishes the grammatical and syntactical relations of case, tense, gender, number and person. \"Paradigm\" suggests the modeling of a term in all its inflectional forms; it expresses and defines the ways in which we may accept a term as \"real\". It conjugates all the modes of mIdy of any given tenn. We may immediately see then by contrast, that \"theory\" would be concerned with establishing a consistent set of des whereby the acceptable variations in the reality of the given term might be understood and extrapolated. When we ask how the workaday world approaches the parallel relations between \"paradigm\" (inflection) and \"theory\" (formulaic rules), we begin to get a clearer picture of the way in which the de facto approach has effectively sidestepped the issue of inflection altogether (i.e. the determination as to the number of dimensional rotations through which a term may be continued to be regarded as \"existing\" or real), placing the burden of that determination upon the upshot of theory as-ifa de could acncally be given which definitively formulated and resolved the question of what was \"real\" in the first place. It is no wonder that, on the basis of this backward approach, such pronunciations of the New Age issue to the effect that \"you create your own reality\". Apparently so! if we can give a rule that in itselfdeternines the \"real\" (i.e. the number and quality of dimensions in which a term may be conjugated) rather than accounts for and resolves the variant manifestations in the declension of the real. Manifestly, however, we haven't been able to give such a rule as in the first case; and this is the reason behind the reasons why we haven't been able to make that anticipated, collective move into a greater Density or internal richness of our own Reality. The fact of the matter is, the theory can't emerge by natural Birth, until the sufficient Paradigm (the Example or operative Pattern) is given; and the Paradigm can't be given when its popularly-accepted sense has crushed it into a flattened conformance with the profile of Theory. If the world seems desperately to need a new and resolving Theory to implement a totalizing approach to its problems, it has to have a transformativelycritical sense of the required numbers of dimensions, states and values into which such an ultimate Theory must go evenly. It has to be furnished an adequate intimation of the actual scope and proportion to which such a resolving \"theory\" must apply."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"What Items Belong in This Picture? For instance, in formulating our sufficient Worldview, do we or do we not take into consideration-that is, loan any official credence to-the field of alternative and \"free\" energies? do we or do we not make allowances in our pattern for the possible presence of types of consciousness, or kinds of lifeform, that must be granted the full dimension of alien (whether that ultimately means \"alien\" from the stars, other-dimensional doorways or from the \"inner Earth\" itself)? Even taking a glance at the Index or Table of Contents of this present work, sliding down such subheadings as those of \"Electronic Mind Control Projects\", \"Population management through the use of Chemical and Metallic Substances\", \"The CIA and Drug Trafficking\", \"Covert Research in Biological Weapons for Population Management\" etc. it becomes increasingly evident we must be willing to ask whether our \"sufficient pattern\" should be expected to integrate to itself some adequate idea of the momtrous-for the conventional psychologies, long-based on old proportions and prior perceptions of the limits of human behavior, are manifestly inadequate to interpreting the typology of that emergent-outline insistently bucking at the grinding plate-seams between Old and New Worlds of manipulative Order. It becomes increasingly apparent that the provision of a proper model is never simply a matter of rotating all the given pins already stuck in the map; it requires a profound rethinking of terms. After all, the requirement for a \"paradigm\" (bringing some such usage back into the vocabulary altogether) doesn't arise until the growing inadequacy of all former models has manifestly left the field in shambles, and the fires of unquenchable crises are roaring up all around. If therefore the me outcome of Theory depends on the preliminary Model (i.e. paradigm) characterizing the terms to be resolved and unifid by the theory, any such theory would be expected to account for and conjugate in all the actual dimensions through which the factors of the World-problem arise and occur. But this requires an intelligence able to idenh! those dimensions and those factors. It's for this reason we can't say the ideal-resolving Theory only need account for those powers and properties that \"make physical sense\", as with the field of physics alone; we can't say the satisfactory theory would simply have to achieve an understanding of the perceptual or cognitive means by which meaningful \"data\" arise to begin with, or solve for the epistemological dilemma solely. We can't assume that such theory would only be ultimately meaningful if its application satisfied the \"sociological field equations\", or accounted for human presence in terms of \"Topos\". The conditions of the current \"dilemma\" cut through d the categories in which the terms of existence are conventionally conjugated, and now overlap borders so manifestly co-involved but unconventional that any arbitrary drawing-of-the-line simply to suit the \"manageable\" becomes a progressively-less tolerable practice in producing the comprehensive Overview, the authentic Wel- tanschauung. After all, consider: what is it makes a Theory worthwhile in the first place? Isn't it the applicabdity of the theory to all the relevant factors, previously identified or not, which rules on its worthiness? What finally justifies the rarefied abstraction of theory to the concreteness of practice, is certainly the degree to which any such theory furnishes a workable key conforming to the contours of all component tumblers of the particular Lock constituting a restrictive shackle upon the world. Is Fiat in the Imperative Mood, Or Indicative Mood? Therefore we must ask again: who can truly identify the tern? It's only in the proper identification of terms-and a qualified approximation to the allowable elasticity in the \"dimensional\" conjugations of those terms-that the ultimate Ship of a sufficient Theory may be considered Chris- tened, and launched upon its Way. We're culturally conditioned to embrace the acceptable Theory, the guideline rule upon which a basic Worldview may be stretched (even though the functional significance of that view is far"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"from the place where we routinely perceive). The rule of the Medieval churchmen gave the acceptable Worldview of the dark ages, though the operators of that rule resided in the arcanum of illuminated texts in an era of illiteracy so that the effective distances between culturally conditioned (religious) Theory and feudal praxis accounted for the particuIar \"grain\" of the general perception upsurging in the Discrepancy. Similarly, we \"perceive\" reality presently according to the (sociopolitical and cultural) tensions arising in the general relations of indentured \"consumerism\", to the technological clergy and empowered priestcrafi in possession of that Rulebook we're conditioned to worship as relativistic Gospel in a state of effective quantum illiteracy. We know of the Gospel of Einstein; we accept the practical validity of His Great Theory. Yet even members-in-good-standing of the relativistic Hierophancy tend to be insufficiently aware of the Process whereby such a Great Theory (or any great theory) originally came about. It's for that reason \"we\" (and \"they\") tend now to worship the Theory, call it by its progenitor-name Paradigm and seek to force it into giving birth again to Itself! Thus the continuing state of barrenness under a Thundercloud of Expectation-the ongoing fallowness where we expect the relieving Crop. It's too-little-noted or understood that before the Einsteinian Theory, there's tbe Einsteinian Pamdigm. Before any Great concluding Reason, there's the Great underlying Creative. Ordinarily when such epoch-making formulae are produced as with the celebrated \"Einsteinian field equations\", they're treated as though their titan character is ascribable to the fact that they manage-in whatever manner-to make sense of a group of \"established facts\" already laying around in a suggestive though apparently unrelated way. It's insufficiently appreciated that we value the outcome of the Michelson-Morley experiment, the Machian model of motion, the topologies of Rieinannian space and Maxwell's unification of electricity and magnetism owing to their initial iden- tifiation in the formative phases of Einsteinian theory. There was, in fact, nothing \"inevitable\" about them until their values were de@ed by the beauty and success of the theory in which they were incorporated. Thus the generation of the theory depended upon a foundational work; and that foundational work involved a faculty of discrimination or power of imaginative perception entering the overall picture as a critical--and indispensable-variable of surpassing Creativity. The parts ultimately participating in the workable pattern aren't given, gratis; they must be determined-as an examination of the general state of physics just prior to the Einsteinian epoch will show; they must be creative4 iden~@d and integrated in a frankly-ticklish process that approximates toward Wholeness in delineating dimensions grand-enough to give true measure of the arable ground while sufficiently frugal to act as praetorian valve filtering anything unnecessary to a fit description of that Ground. This Pattern, composed of just such selectively identified and creatively-integrated com- ponents, gives us the true sense of Paradigm and shows why Theory doesn't decide upon the \"declen- sions\" in which Reality is to be cast but rather rises up out of an initial Vision, sufficiently monumental in scope and secure in its creative courage to declare-in swift bold strokes like an astonishing, deft Pinthe general outline of the minimum Starmap on which the would-be Magellans of the New Reality must thereafter navigate. Magi Bearing Gifts of the Paradigm, To the Manger of the Millennia1 Worldview The very reason then, that virtually every theory generated on the basis of the minimum criteria for \"theories\" alone (i.e. beauty and fitness of form, applicability to defined sets of circumstances etc.) doesn't break a decisive bamer and bring the general attention to a New World of awaiting productivity, is given in this consideration of the Epochal Theory-for only the Epochal Theory has sprung full blown in a stke of \"critical massn from the forehead of an adequate Pdigm. The"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Paradigm is always the key, that decisive Creative Ground constituting the initiatory Pattern declaring a revolution in the inflection of terms, insisting with persuasive psychic and rational Force upon the inclusion of just so challenging a dimensional range in the full conjugation of working elements as is impermissible in the standard context (yet produced nevertheless at the extremes of that context) without waiting upon due legitimation by the appointed Hierophancy of the present Order. Only where the ground-breaking creative work of that sufficient Paradigm already exists and has given sign of its activity, may the Epochal Theory be brought forward full term. This fact being critically underappreciated owing to the aforesaid glib equation of paradigm with theory, we have no reason to wonder any longer why \"theory\" so often fails toserve the field of tangible concerns but instead elicits contemptuous reaction in the frequent functional gap between abstract Pronouncement and refractory, existential detail. Any such Paradigm, any such bold Creative pattern may be identified-in the given case-as having been generated by a source or sources distinct from the ultimate theory-bearer, or the same as the ultimate theory-bearer. Sometimes there's a more obvious one-to-one identity between heroic Paradigm-maker and great cultural Formula-bringer as in the case of Einstein himself, or of Darwin who delineated the pattern by an irreducible act of creative selection before distilling from it a single, Survivalist Theory. Sometimes the determinant of Paradigm-relevance will issue as a more collective outline from many, sedulous sources before a single focus crystallizes it to common view-as happened in quantum physics just'prior to the posting of Heisenberg's heterodox billet on the churchdoor of scientific mechanism. However it occurs it may be uniformly affirmed that, at the juncture of any great Reality- shift it's always in the cwafivematni:of an undedyingPuradignz that the actual leaps are initially taken, all the deeds of cognitive valor enacted and the taboos tackled as down some dark passage in the Dream-time rite of the Symbolizing Psyche. It's always in that chthonic stream, that subterranean current crackling with creative fires over the sheet of its surface like a psychic Styx that all the pioneering is actually done, all caves and verboten tunnels (opening tesseract routes under drawn-out tradelanes above) are explored by persistent assault-waves of solitary spelunking without benefit of miner's cap or acetylene torch (since No Man has passed this Way before). Therefore it may be that the white-smocked Theoretician basks in bracing daylight of the general approval, when once he raises high the particular Excalibur of his steely Formula from the Stone-matrix wherein it was complexly embedded; yet all the terse abstraction of his formulaic marks are hewn upon the peak of an incalculable Mountain that few may take the measure of--often including himself. That mountain is the Matrix, the Magical Mountain indeed, upthrust in a seeming moment from the flat plain of the demoted worldview where most still lingeringly stand. The Slithering Serpent of the Slinky-toy Paradigm Of course we're used to the term \"paradigm\" in its relation to the field of physics, since it issues modernly as a scientific pointer-and that's why we've taken such examples here. However, because a true paradigm serves todetennine the scope of elements ultimately factored into the Resolving Formula, we may say that the greater the emergent Worldview of focused theory the greater the underlying Paradigm-therefore the less restricted a priori to any particular field in the derivation of terms it comes to consider relevant. Considering how great is the requirement for such a Paradigm now, able somehow to resolve the EullpanopZy of crises appearing on every single front whether approached categorically in terms of the hard or soft sciences, the \"psychic\", \"spiritual\" or \"artistic\" sensibility etc., we're hardly justified in relying on the scientific hierophancy itself to save the day (as with the Einsteinian model of our century's earlier \"epoch\") since that field is precisely in question as a total orientation along with all'the others. Indeed we must at this point lift our collective head to review the March of Paradigms (excuse your compulsive punster) over the greater span of history; in so doing we find everything settling into"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Perspective so that, for example, underlying the emergent Religious Worldview of the Middle Ages we find the paradigmatic substructure of feudal hierarchy; beneath the humanistic Worldview we find the foundational paradigm of wid capital, floated toward a vankhing-point horizon by the Hanseatic League mediating a mercantile middle-class; and beneath the Scientific Worldview we find an informing paradigm of complex considerations greatly beyond the question of science in itself, rooted in the religious and humanistic crises finding deeply epi.stemological expression in the cogito etc. We may therefore, along with Hegel and his back-masked understudy Maw look upon that \"march of history\" itself in terms of the dialectic paradigm (since it moves in obvious Sine upon successive arcs of a spiral-or we should say it's rather more like a Slinky toy undulating along an Escher staircase where, the deeper it descends from the Divine paradigm of theology to the magical paradigm of myth, frommyth to religion, from religion to humanism, the higher it simultaneously ascends toward the theological extreme once more only this time in good dialectic fashion having come to the crisis of Divinity again in terms of Consciousness Itself). From mythic to scientific worldview, then, we trace the saga of consciousness as it seeks to determine the proper field of its study. Therefore just as old Karl came to proclaim that the proper study of Mankind is Man so we are in the advantageous \"dialecticaln position to proclaim (at this millend juncture of historical crisis) that the proper study of Comcio~(sness is the field of Comcio~cs- ness itself! We find a unique implication in the inexorable character of this conclusion: at this stage, any resultant theory able to do justice to the required phase of an epochal Paradigm patterning a Whole reorientation with respect to Consciousness itself, must necessarily be a Living Theory (in the same way VGER of Star Trek, The Movie refused the conventional denouement of a merely mathematical bite, insisting on plugging in directly the anode and cathode of \"conscious\" and \"autonomic\" systems thus generating a Transcendental Fieworks where a dry equation was programmed to take place). Any such Theory must be a Living Theory and thus inseparable from Practice. The proper response to anypresent Paradigm of the proper magnitude, then, is necessarily that of Comciousness in Theory and Practice. Buddy, Can You Paradigm? This brings us to the verypractical question, then, as to who is in the position to recognize the real term of the problem to begin with? who is factualy capable of understanding that behind each \"separate\" crisis (in the inequitable distribution of world resources, suppressed and privately arrogated preserves of \"alternative energies\", the ubiquitous breakdown of traditional structures, the natural and manmade interplay of ecological catastrophes) there is the critical Common ~enominator'of One unresolved Question: that very question of Consciousness. Who can generate the only adequate matrix for a full-term Paradigm commensurate with this moment? Who is capable of recogniring the real point, and of sustaining that recognition through a thorough and consistent review without succumbing along the way to the universal agitation for provisional (and inadequate) poultices-as if a greater totality could be constructed on the basis d some sham cohomology of myriad, stopgap patches. Of course we know so many of instant self-presumption willing to come to the Call; yet one large Type excludes itself on principle, though it would never recognize itself as such, by slamming shut any apparently-material door when the glaring halation of the \"psychic\" seeps around its opening edges. Another Type excludes itself just as unerringly when in its eclectic eagerness (not to say egregious, New Age \"openness\") it pitchforks absolutely everything together in one piled recitation without the slightest idea how--or even whether--anything actually fits. No, in this case of our potential new Paradigm it won't necessarily be the formal physicist who fashions it, so locked in specialization that his grandest concept of \"paradigm\" tends to focus down on isolating the proper gauge-group for an unambiguous String Theory... for, even as he mixes and matches the tables of comparative matrices (entranced in his sanctioned redoubt), shadow researchers in electricians' smock move tables and mattresses of their own into government labs setting up"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"permanent shop in the Alternative Energies wing right across the hall, the door to which is simply marked Maintenance Engineer.

When however the purveyor of any such sufficient Paradigm appears, whether stepping out from the nominal door of any of the conventional categories or emerging from \"no expected quarter'- we may recognize him by a manifest transcendence of every categorial limit, by demonstrable surpassing of the professional commitment to one field of expertise or even combinations of fields defined by their specializations.

And we'll note as well that the sensitivity of the Ad~t isn't optional in this case, but must show as a visible appointment.

Time's Up, Folks! The Correct Answer Is. .. Given such characterization of the minimally-suitable candidate, the comparative rarity of the required qualities should become evident. Not only are they rare qualities when considering the potential Paradigm-maker; the capacity even to identifi such qualities in another implies a sufficiency of corresponding substance in the observer. In addition to the question as to who might ultimately appear as most-likely candidate to produce the Full-term Model, the sufficient Paradigm, we must also ask the complementary question who is going to be up to identifying him should he step forward? Val Vale~n and the Matrix material have been around for awhile now, a handful of very high-profile years. Asufficient amount of time has elapsed, a great enough Grace period has been given, as it were, so that if in the interim there were someone qualified to identify What's There he should certainly have done so by now. In all the many words and references read in relation to Valerian, Matrix and the periodical Leading Edge, whether positive or negative in character, precious few have accorded a recognition really commensurate with the ongoing quality of the Work; and none, absolutely none that one has read, have correctly identified that Work for what it is at all. Thus in illustration of the apparently-indispensable principle \"it takes one to know one\", the writer of this Introduction himself steps foxward at the lapse of the general Timer taking the measure of humanity's furthest capacity for response, so that the presence of a Paradigm-key may be properly announced.

In the first Matrir volumes the verboten spacealien subject was unprecedentedly aired and fused to themes of alternative technologies, hidden government agendas etc. No self-respecting particle physicist would touch such themes with a ten foot pole-which is exactly why it isn't the self-respecting particle physicist who comes forward now, with a prodigious Proposition basically identifiable in the true measure of its value onlyfrom the framework of that Whole-being Consciousness toward which it points.

In this case there are two such messengers at the Court, so that--at least--one may introduce the other. Here then is Val Valerian and Moh.Lr III. Seekers of the Paradigm may quit seeking.

During this lifelong process, most people look around and note that things more or less stay the same; nothing seems to really improve - things appear to be in a constant process of deterioration. The oft-promised factors of life, liberty, and health are never realized. The public perception of the reasons behind this dark trend are somewhat limited; like sheep in the pasture, they cannot realize the depth and influence of what is around them - what it really means and what is really going on that maintains their lives in such a miserable state of existence. In the previous book, we examined the apparent factors that are behind the world power structures, as well as a plethora of events that appear to be happening in the interaction between humans and some alien species, with particular attention to the abduction area and government and alien underground operational sites. In this work, we will be examining areas that appear to be \"closer to home\", with particular attention to the sociological parameters of social control - areas that comprise the final manifestation of control, both overtly and covertly, for the human planetary power structures known as the \"New World Order\". We will also be examining updated information since the last book was published in areas such as mind control and alien interaction, as well as a completely new area of approach - that of personal evolution of consciousness in the face of social drama. There comes a time in many peoples lives when they start working on themselves and their own consciousness; who you are and what you can do in consciousness is, for most people, a greater mystery than the subject of alien interaction. Since \"consciousness is the name of the game\" everywhere in the universe, it makes sense to start with the discussion of higher levels of manipulation, as in Matrix 11, move to levels of manipulation that directly affect people, and then provide people with an under- standing of who they are and what they can become; this understanding will provide them with the tools in their consciousness to resolve the dualities in their lives and hopefully to rise above the planetary interactions that impact their 1 ives in an undesirable manner.

Along with the development of knowledge and understanding in this area, the physical body is also changed. This whole matter is, admittedly quite an undertaking, but ultimately it must be done by someone, so why not just do it? In summary, the process involves: 1. Achieving an understanding of what is purposely being done to the human species by the world power structures on a physiological, mental and spiritual level; 2. Acquiring increased knowledge in many different areas relating to the physiological, mental and spiritual aspects of the human being. 3. Using this acquired knowledge to promote ones own self-development, self-empowerment and ones consciousness. Even after all this material is presented, it is a fact that only a small percentage of you will actually make use of the information to change your lives and your consciousness. As humans have a lot of internal programming that resists change of any kind, it will be an uphill battle for most of you - most of you will not succeed. The fact that you are predisposed to have this book in the first place is a plus - it is an indication that you are open to change and open to contemplation of new information. Human beings on this planet live in a reality that is conditioned by the culture they live in. Cultures on this planet, with few exceptions, manifest themselves in such a way that there exist at least five major groups within a culture that reflect an individuals position in society: 1.Those who have a limited awareness and yield their personal power to others without question. 2.Those who have a 1 imi ted awareness, and seek/use their position to acquire power to manipulate other human beings. 3.Those who have a growing awareness that there is more to life but they are unable to penetrate the cultural veil and still give up their personal power. 4.Those who are able to penetrate the cultural veil to a significant degree, but lack the knowledge to prevent reactive depression and giving up of personal power."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"MATRIX III 5.Those who have penetrated the cultural veil, acquired knowledge, conscious awareness, and self-empowerment. There are more divisions possible in a culture, but let us leave it at that for purposes of this discussion. The above groups are listed in such a way that they represent a growing order of consciousness. After consultation with others and a little contemplation, a relative estimate of the percentages of the above groups in the United States might be: Here in 1992, we are faced with a situation where more and more people are joining Groups 3 and 4, since the self-limiting nature of social operations conducted in the conscious states of Groups 1 and 2 become more obvious as time marches on. The old cultural adage \"You can fool some of the people some of the ti me, but not a1 1 of the people a11 the time\" seems to describe the process.

When it's all over and you finish the book, you'll hopefully be moving rapidly toward joining Group 5.

In 1992, all the major intelligence agencies (CIA, NSA, DIA, NSC, etc) will be combined into one agency, the National Center for Intelligence (NCI), which will be near Mount Weather in Virginia. Supposedly, this oxymoronic agency will be headed by one man who is not supposed to have ties to any of the agencies within it. The effect of this will be that the CIA, DIA, and NSA will disappear as separate operating agencies (externally), so any wrong- doing that has been associated with these agencies will be that much harder to follow up on in terms of prosecution. 2.

During the period between January and February 1992, an interesting development occurred in Florida which was passed on to us; it was not publicized outside the state of Florida. During a train derailment, two boxcars broke open, revealing that they (and in fact the whole train) were loaded with shackles. A trainload of shackles? The train was bound for the area of Oregon and Washington. 5. In 1990, several bikers in Oregon chanced upon a six- lane dirt highway in central Oregon that was in the middle of nowhere. They followed the road until they were confronted with three 260-pound individuals that told them to leave or they would be killed. All three indivduals were exactlt alike. I can see twins, but three? Reports are coming from Oregon which indicate that large 40-acre plots are being carved out of the woods through the auspices of the U.S. Forest Service, cleared and grubbed and surrounded with an eight-foot barbed wire fence that also penetrates some four feet under the ground. According to the U.S. Forest Service, the areas are for growing seedlings. A large hazardous waste incineration facility (50 acres) was built somewhere in central Oregon by the U.S.Government, according to an ex-military fellow we encountered at Preparedness Expo 1991 in Tacoma. It was brand new a couple of years ago and has never been used. It is similar to a facility built in Onoway, Canada some years ago - also a facility that just sits there.

There are indications that the larger the human population, the more rapidly the population as a whole will evolve. You will understand why as you delve into this book. This may also explain the drive by certain factions to limit and control population, much in the way the Nefilim may have done 200,000 to 350,000 years ago when it was discovered that the human \"experiment\" had more genetic potential than was suspected. Genetic changes (there may have been as many as 64) in human beings were made in order to limit the human being. The state of consciousness that sought to limit the human being is still impinging on this planet, filtering down into planetary control procedures that are documented in this book.

The more people that grow in consciousness, the easier it will be for others to grow.

This recognition will allow you the realization that what are apparently separate polarities in \"conflict' is actually the same thing viewed from two different perspectives.

Understanding these concepts will also allow you to more effectively reach your conclusions after the book has been completed. We'll build on concepts as we go. Standing Waves If you stretch a string between two points and pluck the string in the middle of its length, we see for a short time the outline of the string in the extreme positions of its movement which form two symmetric arcs: If you pluck the string at the one-quarter mark of its length, you will see the following shape: The areas between the arcs represent standing waves. We get such waves by plucking the string at distances that wil divide the string into integral numbers. In the first figure above, the distance between the two ends of the string corresponds to half a wave; in the second figure, the distance between the two ends of the string accomodates a full wavelength. In the second figure, the string has a point in the middle which is at rest. Such points of rests are called nodes. When the nodes along the string appear stattionary while the rest of the string is vibrating, we call such behavior a \"standing wave\". Oscillators and Resonant Systems An oscillator can be described as anything which moves in a regular periodic manner, such as a vibrating string, a clock pendulum, or a weight hanging on a spring- Oscillators produce a sound as long as they alter their environment in a periodic manner. Suppose we tune two violins, then put one of them on a table and play the other one, If we watch carefully, we will see that the same string we are playing on the violin is the same string that Vibrates in the violin on the table. This illustrates the concept of sympathetic resonance between the two vibrating strings (oscillators). Such a system, made up of"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"MATRIX III two tuned oscillators, is called a resonant system. Rhythm Entrainment Nature finds it more economical in terms of energy to have periodic events that are close enough in frequency to occur in phase or in step with each other. Such a phenomenon can be seen to occur if we have two pendulum clocks on a wall. If we start one clock and then start the other, after a while the two pendulums will fall into step with each other. This phenomenon is called rhythm entrainment. Coherency When two sets of periodic functions or waves get in step with each other or become in phase with each other, we can say that they are coherent. The concept of coherence is important in understanding how living systems make use of electro- magnetic signals. Nature uses highly coherent electromagnetic signals between and within living systems. The range of freq- uencies involved extends downwards from the ultra-violet, where radition becomes ionizing, through to the sub-Hertz ranges of seconds-per-cycle. The lowest frequency meaningful to the living organism is the frequency corresponding to the reciprocal of its life-span; such fine tuning of frequency through the life span of a living system carries with it the risk of sensitivity to and disruption by (purposeful or other- wise) environmental coherent electromagnetic fields or, as we shall see later on in the book, disruption by virtue of higher order fields which lie outside the electromagnetic spectrum. Oscillations and resonances happen in any structure. They become useful when they are interrupted in a coherent manner to convey information. This process is called modulation. Highly coherent oscillations can act as carriers for modulat- ion representing a control function for the regulation maintenance of homeostasis (control or regulation) in living sys tems .

With reference to the physical body, it is termed the etheric body. This energy form is itself conditioned and governed by the dominant solar or planetary energy which ceaselessly creates it, changes and qualifies it. The etheric body, in the vast majority of humans, is the vehicle or the instrument of astral energy. The mass of humanity are still Atlantean or astral in their nature. The etheric body is composed-of interlocking and circulating lines of force emanating from the many levels of consciousness of our planetary life. These lines of energy and this closely interlocking system of streams of force are related to seven focal points or centers to be found within the etheric body. Each of these centers are related to certain types of incoming energy. When the energy reaching the etheric body is not related to a particular center, that center remains passive; when it is related and the center is sensitive to its impact, then that center becomes vibrant and receptive and develops as a controlling factor in the life of the man on the physical plane. The dense physical body is held together by and is expressive of the energies which compose the etheric body. These energies appear to be of two types: the energies which form, through interlocked lines, the underlying etheric body, as whole and in relation to all physical forms. This form is qualified then by the general life and vitality of the plane on which the Dweller in the body functions, and therefore where his consciousness is normally focussed. Another type of energy is the particular energies by which the individual consciously chooses to govern his daily activities. As attitude, attainment and compre- hension shift to higher levels, the etheric body will be constantly changing and responding to newer energies. The etheric body interpenetrates, underlies, and occupies the entire physical organism. It extends beyond the physical form and surrounds it like an aura. According to the point in evolution will be the area which the etheric body covers beyond the outside of the physical body. It may extend for a few or many inches. Within the physical body, the network of the etheric body is to be found permeating every single part. It is particular- ly associated at this time with the nervous system, which is fed, nourished, controlled and galvanized by its etheric counterpart. This counterpart is present in millions of tiny streams or lines of energy, to which the Eastern occultist has given the name \"nadis\". These nadis are the carriers of energy. They are in fact the energy itself and carry the quality of energy from some area of consciousness in which the Dweller in the body may happen to be focussed. According to the state of consciousness and the psychic state of awareness, so will be the type of energy carried by the nadis, passing 0012"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"MATRIX III from them to the outer nervous system. It must always be remembered that the seven energy centers are not within the dense physical body. They exist only in etheric matter and in the etheric so-called aura, outside the physical body. They are closely related to the dense physical body by the network of nadis. Five of the centers are to be found in the etheric counterpart of the spinal column, and the energy passes through the spinal vertebrae and circulates then throughout the etheric body as it is interiorly active within the physical vehicle. Three head centers exist, one just above the top of the head, another just in front of the eyes and forehead, and the third at the back of the head, just above where the spinal column ends. In practice, the center at the back of the head is not counted in the initiation process, any more than is the spleen, so we have then seven centers to examine . The powerful effect of the inflow of energy, via the energy body, has itself automatically created these centers or reservoirs of force; the effect of these seven centers upon the physical body in due time produces condensation or a state of what is called \"attracted response\" from dense matter, and thus the seven major sets of endocrine glands slowly came into functioning activity. The whole development of the etheric body falls into two historical stages. The first stage is that in which the etheric energy, flowing thorough responsive centers and creating endocrine glands as a consequence, gradually begin to have a definite effect upon the blood stream; the energy worked through that medium solely for a very long time. This still remains true, for the life aspect of energy animates the blood, through the medium of the centers and their agents, the glaqds. Hence the words in the Bible that \"the blood is the: life\". Secondly, as the race of men developed, and consciousness grew greater and certain great expansions took place, the centers began to extend their usefulness and to use the nadis, and thus to work upon and through the nervous system; this produced conscious and planned activity upon the physical plane. The energy tubules, or nadis, pass to certain areas of the body in three ways: Through the seven major centers Through the twenty-one minor centers Through 49 focal points scattered all over the body The physical body, therefore, is triple in design. There is the etheric body, the nadi system and the dense physical body. 0014"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Telepathic Activity Telepathic activity appears to be present in three modes in developing human beings. Instinctual telepathy is based upon those impacts of energy which come from one etheric body and make an impression upon another. The medium of communication employed is the etheric substance of all bodies, which is necessarily one with the etheric substance of the planet. The areas around the Solar Plexus (SP) are sensitive to the impact of etheric energy, for this area in the etheric body is in direct \"touch\", as it were, with the astral body, the feeling body. Also, close to the solar plexus is found that center near the spleen which is the direct instrument for the entrance of prana into the human mechanism. Prana might be defined as the life-essence- This instinctual response to etheric contact is said to be the mode of communication in Lemurian times, and largely took the place of thought and speech. It concerned itself primarily with two types of impression: that which had to do with the instinct of self-preservation, and that which had to do with self- reproduction. A higher form of this instinctual telepathy has been preserved for us in the expression we so frequently use, \"I have a feeling that ...\" and allied phrases. These are more definitely astral in their implications and work through the astral substance, using the solar plexus area as a sensitive plate for impact and impression. This astral (not etheric) sensitivity, or \"feeling telepathy\" also basically the Atlantean mode of communication, and involved finally the use of the solar plexus center itself as the receiving agent; the emitting agent worked, however, through the entire area of the diaphragm. It was as though there appeared a gathering of outgoing waveforms in that part of the human vehicle. The relatively wide area from which the information was sent out acted as a large general distributor; the area which received the impression was more localized, involving only the solar plexus. The reason for this can be found in the fact that in Atlantean days the human being was still unable to think, as we understand thinking. The whole lower part of the body, in sense difficult for us to grasp, was given up to feeling; the communicator's one thought-contribution was the name of the recipient, plus the name or noun form of that which was the idea to be conveyed. This embryonic thought winged its way to its goal, and the powerful \"feeling\" apparatus of the solar plexus received it and drew the \"feeling impression\" there, drawing on the communicator. It is this process which is pursued when, for instance, some mother \"feels\" that some danger threatens her child, or that something is taking place in connection with her child. Instinctual telepathy will often manifest in two ways. It will be from solar plexus to solar plexus between two people who are ordinary, emotional, governed by desire and primarily centered in the astral and animal bodies. In addition, it will"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 be between such a \"solar plexus\" person and another whose solar plexus center is functioning actively but whose throat center is also alive. This type of person registers in two places - provided that the thought sensed and sent out by the solar plexus person has in it something of mental substance or energy. Pure feeling and entirely emotional emanations between people necessitate only solar plexus contact. Instinctual telepathy has also been referred to as Sympathetic Telepathy, which involves a sense of immediate understanding, awareness of events, apprehensions of happenings, and identification with personality reactions. The entire process involves the lower aspects of the Universal Mind as an agent. Mental TeleDathv Today, instinctual telepathic communication is still the major expression, but at the same time, Mental Telepathy is becoming increasingly prevalent. The throat center is primarily involved where mental telepathy is concerned; there is also sometimes a little heart center activity and always a measure of solar plexus reaction. Hence our problem. Frequently the communicator will send a message via the throat center, and the recipient will still use the solar plexus. Mental telepathy is the rapport established between minds; it also includes the telepathic response to current thoughtforms and thought conditions in the world today. Mental telepathy could also be termed the interplay of transmitted thought. It is related to the higher aspect of the Universal Mind, to the intelligent Will, Straight mental telepathy is one of the highest demonstrations of the personality; it is in the nature of a bridging faculty, for it is one of the major steps towards the higher impression; it always presupposes are relatively high stage of mental development, The strong desire to achieve success in telepathic work, and the fear of failure, are the surest ways to offset fruitful effort. In all such work as this, an attitude of non- ttachment and a spirit of \"don't care\" are of real assistance. Emotion, and the desire for anything on the part of the receiver create streams of energy which rebuff or repulse that which seeks to make contact, such as the directed thought of someone seeking rapport. When these streams are adequately strong, they act like a boomerang and return to the emanating center, being attracted back there by the power of the vibration which sent them forth. In other words, intense desire to make a satisfactory impression will attract the outgoing back again to the transmitter. You can see, therefore, how a cultivation of detachment is a necessary qualification for success in telepathic work. ,"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"MATRIX III Intuitional Tele~athv Intuitional telepathy is one of the developments upon the path of the Initiate. The area involved is the head and throat, and the three centers which will be rendered active in the process are the head center, which is receptive to impression from higher sources, and what is called the Ajna Center, which is receptive to intuitional impressions; this Ajna Center (between the eyebrows) can then \"broadcast\" what which is received and recognized, using the throat center as the creative formulator of thought, and the factor which embodies the sensed or intuited idea. The truly telepathic individual is one who is responsive to impressions coming to him from all forms of life. Intuitional telepathy begins to manifest increasingly among advanced human beings. This indicates soul contact and the consequent awakening of group consciousness, for sensitivity to intuitional impressions has to do only with group concerns. Group Telepathic Work The course of evolution is taking the human species toward eventual work together as a group where telepathic work is concerned. There are several factors which appear to govern united group telepathic work. First, it is essential as a member of a group that is evolving in consciousness and working on telepathic levels that you acquire facility in tuning in on each other with deepest love and understanding; that you develop impersonality so that when a brother tunes in on what he perceives is a weakness or a strength, it evokes from you no reaction that could upset the harmony of the group. The discovery of what is perceived as a weakness should produce only the evocation of a deeper love. If individuals cannot tune in on each other with ease after long periods of close relationship, how can they, as a group, tune in on some individual or some group of individuals unknown to them in their personalities? Secondly, constant effort must be carried forth to bring about a group love of such strength that nothing can break it and no barriers rise up between you; to cultivate a group sensitivity of such a quality that your diagnosis of conditions will be relatively accurate; to develop and unfold a group ability to work as a unit, so that there will be nothing in the inner attitudes of group member which could break into their carefully established rhythm. Thirdly, any group work along telepathic lines must be carefully controlled; any group effort which seeks to impress the mind of any subject (whether an individual or a group) must be guarded as to motive and method; any group endeavor 0017"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 which involves a united applied effort to effect changes in the point of view, an outlook on life, or a technique of living must be utterly selfless, most wisely and cautiously undertaken, and must be kept free from any personality emphasis, any personality pressure and any mental pressure which is formulated in terms of mental belief, prejudice, dogmatism or ideas. The result of all true telepathic work and rightly directed effort to \"impress\" a subject will be to leave him with a strengthened will to right action, an intensified interior light, as astral body freer from the idea of glamour, and a physical body more vital and purer. The potency of a united group activity is powerful. The occult aphorism that \"energy follows thought\" is either a statement of truth or else a meaningless phrase. Induction of Tele~a thic States by Inaestion of Substances Several years ago, it was rumored that some company in Canada had produced a substance which, if ingested, gave individuals telepathic abilities. This was reported in 1990 in The Leading Edge in some detail. Obviously, the Canadian government stopped the company from continuing business. There are, however, natural substances that are reported to enhance telepathic ability. One of those substances comes from a woody vine known as Ayahuasca, which is found in Brazil. The vine contains a number of alkaloids with psychoactive properties - one of which has been called \"telepatin\", because it seems to turn those around you to glass, so that you can see through their bodies and read their minds. Lyall Watson, author of Beyond Supernature, tried it and vouches for this apparent effect. The most interesting thing about Ayahuasca is that it appears to have chameleon qualities. It is a door which opens on a variety of landscapes, connecting an individual to information sources in the animal kingdom . Tele~a thic Sensi tivi ty Telepathic sensitivity should be and always is a normal unfoldment when the individual is correctly oriented and completely dedicated. If it is a forced process, then development does not occur correctly. Where the individual on a path of conscious initiation is concerned, release from the constant consideration of personal circumstances and problems leads inevitably to a clear mental release; this then provides areas of free mental perception which make the higher sensitivity possible. Sensitivity to impression involves the engendering of a magnetic aura upon which the highest impressions can play and come into the mind. This magnetic aura, as it were, begins to form from the first moment a 0018"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"MATRIX III contact with the soul is made. It deepens and grows as those contacts increase in frequency and become eventually a habitual state of consciousness. Areas of sensitivity appear to pass through three stages. First, sensitivity to impression from other human beings. Secondly, sensitivity to group impression - the passage of ideas from group to group. The individual can become a receptive agent within any group of which he is a part, and this ability indicates progress on his part. Thirdly, sensitivity to hierarchical impressions from consciousness on higher levels. The mental aura develops rapidly once an individual takes his own development consciously in hand, or once the polarization of the personality is upon the mental plane. The time will come when the mental energy will obscure the emotional or astral energy, and then the soul quality of love will create a substitute. Scientific Data About Telepathic Receiving States Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with an increased degree of sensitivity for telepathy. When the para-sympathetic nervous system is activated, an increased amount of acetylcholine is released. A sense of traveling clairvoyance is also apparent, as well as relaxation, well-being, and pleasure. The para-sympathetic nervous system is mildly activated by an excess of negative ions in the atmosphere. It was found that an excess of negative ions significantly increased telepathy scores over control-level scores. It can also be mildly activated by use of the skeletal muscle system, Scientific data has also be gained relative to telepathic scores and breathing. The highest scores in laboratory trials were associated with respiration through the left nostril. Charged ions collect on the roof of the nasal passage and exert a paramagnetic effect on the brain, or on the expansion of psi-plasma. Telepathic Reception The first stage of correct telepathic reception is the registering of an impression; it is generally vague at the beginning, but as a thought, idea, purpose or intention becomes more concrete, it slips into the second stage which appears as a definite thoughtform; finally, that thoughtform makes its impact on the consciousness of the brain in the location lying just behind the area between the eyes and consequently in the area of the pituitary body. It can appear also in the region of the solar plexus center. For those who are conditioned by the elements of the personality, the 0019"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"MATRIX III impression is the factor of importance; their consciousness is impressed, and so sensitive is their response to the higher impression that they absorb the impression so that it becomes a part of their own energy. Telepathic sending states are characterized by sympathetic nervous system activity- The sympathetic nervous system is activated by adrenalyn-like compounds and is antagonistic to the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is associated with the fight or flight action or emotional conditions that embody a threat. Telepathic sending states which are characterized by the use of the ,sympathetic nervous system are sometimes referred to as \"crisis telepathy\", which involves an sending individual who is under stress, prompted by need and carrying a message of biological significance. The literature and folklore of most people include such events. Reports of \"crisis telepathy\" are common enough in our own culture - many people claim to have direct knowledge of the sinking of the Titanic. Most of the best evidence comes from less technical, less skeptical cultures, and much of the evidence suggests that crisis calls are not so much broadcast as finely focused. One interesting example concerns a Cajun from New Orleans, a tough 32 year old Creole who joined the crew of a fishing boat working deep waters at the north-west end of the Hawaiian islands. On the evening in question, they had been trawling and, in a quiet moment the man decided to go to the crew quarters. As he grabbed the hatch rail, he slipped and fell flat on his back on the deck below. Nobody saw the accident, and the man lay there, paralyzed and in pain. He was convinced that he was about to die, and wondered what would become of his young American friend Milly- He noticed that the time was 9:12 and then passed out. On the main island 600 miles away, Milly was visiting the home of the boat's captain, passing the evening in a little social embroidery. The wife of the skipper was a full-blooded Samoan, who was intent on her needlework, chatting away cheerfully, until she felt what she later described as \"a blow at the back of the head\". She slipped semi-conscious to the floor and when she could speak, said \"something very bad has happened on the boat\". And then she added, \"It isn't Bill\" - her husband. When Milly looked at the clock on the wall, the time was 9:14. It was not until the early hours of the following morning that the Coast Guard called to tell her that the Creole had been landed on Kauai with a broken back and was being flown home. One aspect of this case is that the sender was a man from a culture which, at least unconsciously, allows such things as this \"crisis telepathy\" to happen. The message was intended 0020"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"MATRIX III for a woman whose upbringing made her less receptive and, when she proved unresponsive, it appears to have been re-routed to another person nearby who was only indirectly involved, but whose cultural background and perceptual set made her more sympathetic. Once again, it seems that these things are goal-oriented and not only independent of distance, but also indifferent to route and means. It is only results that matter. There have been cases where several.species have worked together in a telepathic manner. J.B. Rhine at Duke University noticed such a case and called it a \"team effect\". In a series of tests on a California beach, Rhine buried a number of small wooden target boxes at random under four inches of sand that was flooded with twelve inches of water as the tide came in. Raking of the sand and subsequent disturbance by water and wind made it impossible to detect the sites visually and unlikely that the targets left olfactory or any other clues to their precise location, Two German shepherd dogs were able, in a series of 203 trials, to locate the hidden boxes underwater with a success rate of 38.9%. The odds against them doing so purely by chance were a billion to one. They were able to do this, provided that they were accompanied by their trainer and were being observed, from a distance and out of sight and hearing, by the person who had buried the boxes. The book Kinship With All Life also relates cases where there is functional interaction between humans and other species. Factors For Successful Tele~athic Work Successful telepathic work is dependent upon the following factors: First, that there are no barriers existing between the receiver and the broadcaster. Such barriers would be lack of love or of sympathy, criticism and suspicion. Secondly, that the broadcaster is mainly occupied with the clarity of his symbol, with the word or thought, and not with the receiver. A quick glance toward the receiver, a momentary sending forth of love and understanding is sufficient to set up the rapport, and then attention must be paid to the clarity of the symbol. Thirdly, let the receivers think with love and affection of the broadcaster for a minute or two. Then let them forget the personality. A thread of energy, linking receiver and broadcaster, has been established and exists. Fourth, let the receivers work with detachment. Much interference and blockage to thoughtforms is caused by the receiver producing thoughtf orms and ill-regulated mental energy."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"MATRIX III Physical Theories of How Tele~athv Works 1.Psi-Plasma Theory: One interesting theory that was put forth about telepathic interaction was that the flow of information needed something to flow on. The theory of a psychic plasma, or psi-plasma, was put forth in the early 1960's by Andrija Puharich. He reasoned that the body, through the behavior of the high potentials contained within the nervous system on a miniature scale, some as high as 3.6 million volts, generates a change in the gravitational constant in the field surrounding the body. A low field in a sending party and a higher than normal field in a receiving party permitted, within the direction vector created by intent and thought, a flow of information between the two people. It was a very interesting presentation of data that had a lot of scientific and mathematical basis. 2.Holoara~hic Theory: Telepathy is a Function of the Holographic Nature of the Structure of the Universe Charles Tart, a professor of psychology at the Davis Campus of the University of California, did some experiments with hypnosis which indicate a deep holographic inter- connectedness between lifeforms. Tart found two graduate students hypnotize each other, in turn, and found that they both went into an altered state in which they both found themselves in the same hallucinated reality; the reality consisted of a beach of unearthly beauty. The sand sparkled like diamonds and the sea was filled with enormous frothing bubbles. The shoreline was dotted with translucent crystalline rocks pulsing with internal light. The two graduate students set about exploring their newfound world, swimming in the ocean, talking between themselves, and studying the glowing rocks. When Tart questioned them about their apparent silence, they told him that in their shared world they were talking, a phenomenon Tart feels involved some kind of paranormal communication between them. In session after session, these two students continued to construct various realities, and all were as real, available to the senses and dimensionally realized as anything they had experienced in their normal waking state. The various worlds constructed in these cases are perfect examples of holographic realities: three-dimensional constructs created out of interconnectedness, sustained by the flow of consciousness, and ultimately as plastic as the thought processes that generated it. The realities were three-dimensional, but the space was reportedly more flexible than the space of what people ordinarily experience and some- times took on an elasticity the two students had no words to describe."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"MATRIX III Human consciousness may not be the only thing that participates in the creation of \"reality fields\" Remote viewing experiments have shown that people can accurately describe distant locations even when there are no human observers present at the locations. Similarly, subjects can identify the contents of a sealed box randomly selected from a group of sealed boxes and whose contents are therefore completely unknown. This means that we can tap into reality itself to gain information. Consciousness pervades all matter, and \"meaning\" has an active presence in both mental and physical worlds. Remote viewing can be looked at as resonance of meaning conveyed from an object to mind. In this view, consciousness comprises and includes anything that can generate, receive, or use information. Thus, animals, viruses, DNA, machines, and so-called non-living objects may have all the prerequisite properties to take part in the creation of reality. What must be grasped is that all that IS is ever present. What we are concerned with is the constant awakening to that which eternally IS, and to what is ever present in the environment. The aim must be to overcome the undue concentra- tion upon the foreground of daily life which characterizes most people, the intense preoccupation with interior states or moods and the lack of sensitivity which characterizes the mass of humanity. Many great teachers have spoken of the time when nothing secret would remain hidden and when all secrets would be shouted aloud from the rooftops. The growth of telepathic and psychic abilities will eventually tend to strip humanity of the ability to transgress against each other without being known for their transgressions. As the race achieves increasingly a mental polarization through the developing attractive power of the mental principle, the use of language for the conveying of thoughts and communication will fall into disuse. According to some sources, it will take about 500 more years for the race to become consciously telepathic; telepathy, then, could be viewed as the seed of future racial potency and ability. It is a process which proceeds through the medium of telepathic groups and telepathic people, and through the medium of scientific investigation. This also involves the building of the thoughtform which will accustom the race to the idea of telepathic work. It is, in the last analysis, the seed of Mas te rhood ."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"MATRIX III Chapter 2 NATURAL FIELDS AND PHYSICS The material in this chapter is being related to you in order to provide you will some background on the natural fields which interact with the human organism, so that you will be better prepared to deal with material in subsequent chapters. I. The Holouraphic Field Aspects of the Universe A phenomena called a hologram is produced when a single beam of laser light is split into two separate beams. The first beam is bounced off the object to be photographed. The second beam is allowed to collide withe the light of the first beam. When this happens, an interference pattern is created and is recorded on-film. To the naked eye, the interference pattern recorded on the film looks nothing like the original object - it looks like a series of concentric rings like those formed when a handful1 of pebbles is thrown into a pool of water, As soon as another laser beam or another bright light source is focused on the film, the image of the original object appears - in 3-D. You can actually walk around a holographic projection and view it from different angles. Over the years many. theories have been put forth to take into account all the phenomena observed in physics, psychic states and the various aspects of memory and perception- No theory has been able to explain all of them with the exception of one - that the universe, which includes our consciousness, ,is holographic in nature. There are two scientists in particular who have also reached this conclusion, both independently of each other. One of them is David Bohm, a protege of Albert Einstein, and the other is Carl Pribram, a neurophyiologist at Stanford University. David Bohm became convinced of the holographic nature of the universe only after years of dissatisfaction with the inability of existing theories to explain all of the phenomenon encountered in quantum physics. Carl Pribram became convinced because of the failure of standard theories about the brain to explain various puzzling neurological phenomena. Another nagging problem on the theoretical side was the inability of any one theory about the nature of reality to explain or account for various phenomena encountered in nature. The holographic model does this, and a whole lot more- The most staggering thing about the holographic model is that it makes sense out of other phenomena that are usually outside the realm of scientific understanding, like telepathy, pre-cognition, remote viewing, and psycho-kinesis."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1x1 Numerous studies have corroborated the holographic model in studies of memory and perception. In 1982, landmark experiment performed by physicist Elaine Aspect demonstrated that the sub-atomic particles that compose the physical universe possesses what appears to be an undenyable holo- graphic property. A Look At Human Memory The human brain is estimated to be able to store information in the quantity between 1x1011 (one hundred trillion) and 2.8 x lOzo (280 quintillion) bits of information. Research into the concept of memory indicates that there appear to be several different aspects of memory. : Short Term Memory: The average capacity of short-term memory is about seven bits of data, which are linked together in \"chunks\" so that longer assemblies of them can be remembered - short-term memory can by definition last from several seconds to several minutes. The part of the brain called the hippocampus is a critical structure in the transfer of short- term memory into long-term storage. Short-term memory typically consists of images, thoughts, or \"bits\" of data persisting for a short period of time. Lona Term Memory: Long-term memory consists of those elements that are transferred from short-term memory into long-term storage. In other to do this, the memory must be \"encoded\" or \"marked\"; the encoding of a memory involves a process of continued attention, as well as a certain amount of emotional input. Semantic Memory: The capacity to remember words as opposed to numbers or pictures. Eidetic Memory: Eidetic memory is a very specific memory function in which, after one has viewed an object or scene, an intensely strong visual image persists when the object or scene is removed. The image remains very vivid at the spot where the object was located, and the location may even be scanned with eye movements, as if the object were still there. To be \"classified\" as eidetic, the image must persist for at least 40 seconds. Interestingly, children possess more capability in this area than adults. It is thought that the phasing in of language offsets this ability or capacity of the brain. Iconic Memorv: Iconic memory is also referred to as \"inter- mediate memory\"; the duration is between STM and LTM, It is"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 sometimes used to describe visual memory that lasts only a tenth of a second or so. Habit Memory: A non-cognitive type of memory that has been also referred to as \"procedural\" memory. It is an automatic memory process that encompasses conditioned reflexes. Information is entered into this type of memory through the sub-cortical basal ganglia structures in the brain. Neural representations are not stored, but rather probabilities existing in relationships between stimulus and response. It could also be termed \"memory without consciousness\", and is often associated with the memory traits of savants. Savant Memory: Memory functions that are manifested in a way that is devoid of emotion, automatic and non-volitional, and not reflective or associational. Visual Image Memory: Visual image memory involves the ability to scan quickly and store, for later recall, vast amounts of extremely detailed and minute information. It is popularly referred to as \"photographic memory\". Compared to eidetic imagery, the image is retained \"in the head\". Figural Memory: Memory involved with recall of pictures. Cosnitive/Associative Memory: Involves the three elements of recognition, retention, and recall. It uses circuits within a \"cortico-limbic\" system, relying heavily on the hippocampus and amygdala linkage to the cortex where the processed images are stored for later recall. The content of the storage is information or knowledge, and the process for which the system is responsible is termed cognition. Contained within the scope of cognitive/associative memory are \"episodic memory\", \"vertical associative memory\", and \"declarative knowledge and processing.\" Ancestral Memory: Ancestral memory is looked at as being genetically inherited memory, whicb is manifested in various instinctual behaviors. It can also include, by virtue of genetics, memory traits or abilities. Numerous studies have corroborated the holographic model in studies of memory and perception. The question of how and where memories are stored was what led Carl Pribram on the road to formulating his holographic model. In the 1940's it was thought that memories were stored at specific locations in the brain. There had been research conducted in the 1920's which seemed to support this view. Researcher Wilder Penfield had offered convincing evidence that specific memories had specific locations in the brain. In a series of experiments, Penfield stimulated parts of the brain of patients and noticed that specific areas evoked certain specific memories."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"MRTRIX III In 1946, Pribram went to work for physiologist Carl Lashley at the Yerkes Institute of Primate Biology. Lashley had trained rats to perform complicated tasks which involved working their way through mazes. He then removed portions of their brain in an effort to try and remove the area that had the memory of the maze. No matter how much brain tissue he removed, the rats still retained the memory of how to run the maze. This indicated that memory itself was not localized but was somehow spread throughout the brain as a whole. No process existed at the time that would explain this. Around 1965, Pribram read an article describing the creation of the hologram and the answer became quite clear. Holograms depend on the interference patterns that occur when the patterns of two or more waves ripple through each other. It was discovered that electrical impulses travel through the brain in waveforms that cause interference patterns, further substantiating the holographic nature of the brain. Another aspect of holograms is that if you take a pice of the hologram and remove it, the piece contains the complete picture of what the total hologram contained. The ability of the brain to preserve memory functions evidently works the same way. Memory is not the only aspect that the brain processes in a holographic way. It was discovered that vision is processed in the same manner. The apparent ability of the brain to create an internal hologram explains the lack of any one-to-one correspondence between the external world and the activity of the brain. The only question that remained was, what wavelike phenomenon was the brain using to create internal holograms? It was known that electrical impulses travel in waves throughout the brain. This turned out to be part of the process that creates internal holograms. Holography also explains how the brain can store so many memories in so little space. Mathematician John Von Neumann, who has achieved some notoriety because of his alledged involvement with the Philadelphia Experiment (Project Rainbow) and the subsequent Phoenix Projects, calculated that over the course of a human lifetime, the brain stores 2.8 x 1020 bits of information (2,800,000,000,000,000,000 bits), as mentioned. Another interesting aspect of the hologram is that by changing the angle with which the light from the laser strikes the photographic film, it was discovered that many 3-D images could be stored on the same piece of film. It has been suggested that our ability to recall data is equivalent to changing the wavefront angle that passes through the brain. When we are unable to recal data, it may be equivalent to failing to find the right angle."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"MATRIX III The holographic aspect offers additional understanding about the associative aspects of memory. There is another type of holographic recording technique in which the light of a single laser beam is bounced off two objects simultaneously. The light bounced off each object is allowed to collide and the interference pattern is captured on film. Whenever one of the objects is illuminated with laser light, and this light is passed through the photographic plate, the image of the other object will appear. If the human brain function is holographic in nature, a similar process might explain why certain things evoke memories of other things. Other types of holography, such as recognition holography and interference holography, may explain how we can recognize familiar things and also recognize the face of someone we have not seen for years. Conversion of Waveform Patterns in the Brain BY the Use of Fourier Transformations Research seems to indicate that in the brain, complex patterns are converted into simple waveforms. During the last century, a mathematician named Fourier evolved what later became known as Fourier Transforms which accomplish the same task - conversion of complex waveforms (interference patterns) into simple waveforms or conversion of images to waveforms and back again. The \"whole-in-every-part\" aspect of holograms is one of the by-products that occur when interference patterns are translated into the Fourier language of waveforms- The Visual Systems of the Brain In the early 1970's researchers discovered that the visual systems in the brain functioned as a kind of frequency analyzer. Since frequency is a measure of the number of oscillations per unit of time, it suggests again that the brain functions in the same way that a hologram does. Later, in 1979, Berkeley physicists Russell and Karen DeValois discovered that in vision, the brain responds not to the patterns of what a person sees, but to the Fourier translations of the patterns. Thus, the brain definitely is making use of Fourier mathematics to convert images into waveforms. This discovery was subsequently confirmed by other labs around the world. Another aspect of the visual system of the brain is that the brain is actually what \"sees\". The eyes only conduct specific frequencies into the brain. Since there is considerable evidence to support the practice of \"eyeless sight\", seeing what is around you, including colors, without the use of the eyes, the brain can be seen as a receiver, translating frequencies impacting it from the exterior into waveforms or images that are perceived by consciousness."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 FOURIER TRANSFORMATION EQUATIONS The following set of pages illustrates the usage of Fourier Transformations in the conversion of waveforms, and is fairly technical.

Work done by the scientist Bekesy and others has demonstrated that the skin is sensitive to frequencies and vibrations. Interestingly, Bekesy also discovered that the mathematical equations that predicted how his subjects would respond to various frequencies were Fourier Translations. Russian physicist Nickoli Bernstein made the discovery that even our physical movements were encoded in the brain in the language of Fourier Transforms, If the brain analyzes movements by breaking them down into their frequency components, it explains the rapid rate at which we learn many complex tasks. In effect, the brain is Fourier analyzing various aspects of complex tasks and absorbing them as a whole, In th 1970's Pribram discovered that selected neurons in the motor cortex respond to a limited bandwidth of frequencies. In Matrix I1 we discussed the use of the process of \"inculcation\" that is performed on various species, including humans, to impart vast amounts of knowledge - especially task related knowledge. Fourier Transforms no doubt play a significant part in this process, as well as in processes that implant \"screen memories\" in those who are abducted, Processes that electronically manipulate consciousness and the brain can easily incorporate Fourier processes to impart a stream of images and other data while areas in the brain, like the hippocampus, can be influenced to affect memory processes. Holoqraphic Aspects of Particles and Waves If the holographic model of the brain is taken to its logical conclusion, it opens the door on the possibility that even \"objective reality\", the world of objects around us, might not exist in the way we believe it exists. It seems likely that what is really \"out there\" is a vast resonating symphony of waveforms that comprise a frequency domain that is transformed into what is perceived only after it enters the brain. Work done by Bohm at Pennsylvania State College indicates that if you break matter down far enough, the \"pieces\" no longer have the traits normally considered to be possessed by \"objects\". Although an electron can sometimes behave as if it were a compact little particle, it was found that it literally possesses no dimension. An electron is simply not an \"object\" as usuallly define an \"object\". An electron can sometimes behave as a \"particle\" or behave as a \"wave\". This ability is common to all \"sub-atomic particles\". Physicists believe that"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 sub-atomic phenomena should be viewed as a single category of something that is somehow both a \"particle\" and a \"wave\"; the \"something\" is called a quanta. There is compelling evidence that the only time quanta manifest as particles is when we are looking at them, which indicates that consciousness plays an important part in the transformation of matter. When an electron is bot being looked at, experimental findings suggest that it is always a \"wave\". Connections between Sub-Atomic Events Indica tina Quanta Possess Consciousness An aspect of quantum reality that is especially interest- ing is the state of inter-connectedness that is seen to exist between apparently unrelated sub-atomic events. At the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, David Bohm did some vital work with plasmas. A plasma is a gas containing a high density of electrons and positive ions (atoms that have a positive charge). Bohm found that once electrons were in a plasma, they stopped \"behaving\" like individuals and started \"behaving\" as if they were part of a larger inter-connected whole. Like some ameboid creature, the plasma constantly regenerated itself and enclosed impurities within a wall, in the same way that a biological organism might encase a foreign substance. The collective movement of electrons in this manner was given the expression \"plasmons\", and their discovery established Bohms reputation as a 'physicist. During this same period, it was discovered that the idea of \"wholeness\" had importance. Classical science looks at the idea of wholeness as the \"sum of the reaction of its parts\". What was indicated was that the behavior of the \"parts\" was actually organized by the.whole, This suggests that the idea of wholeness is the primary aspect of reality. The Conce~t of Non-Local i tv Many interesting things have been discovered in quantum physics. One of the findings involves the idea of location, At the level of our everyday lives, things appear to have specific locations. However, when one examines all the data that has come from investigations at the quantum level, location ceases to exist. All points in space become equal to all other points in space. Physicists have termed this property as non-locality."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 The Concept of Order Classical science generally appears to divide things into ideas of ordered and disordered states of arrangement. As physicists delved more deeply, it was realized that there was no end to the hierarchies of order, and that there is no such thing as disorder. Orders of an ultr-high degree appear as random from a lower perspective. Interestingly, mathematicians are unable to prove the existence of randomness. What we perceive top be a tangible reality is really kind of an illusion. Underlying it is a deeper order of existence that gives birth to all objects and the appearences of objective reality in the same way that a piece of holographic film gives birth to a hologram. There is overwhelming evidence that this deeper order of existence has one source: consciousness. Physicists terms this deeper level of reality the implicate or enfolded order, and the perceived level of existence as the explicate or unfolded order. The manifestation of all forms in the universe are increasingly seen as stages of countless enfoldings and unfoldings between these two types of order. When a \"particle\" appears to be destr~yed, for instance, it is not lost. It is merely enfolded back into the deeper order from which it came. Because everything in the universe appears to be made out of the fabric of the implicate order, which is from one perspective the potential of everything within the void, it becomes meaningless to view the universe as being composed of separate parts- Everything in the universe becomes part of a continuum. Everything is an extension of everything else, and ultimately even the implicate and explicate orders blend into each other. The Holouraphic Aspect of Consciousness We have seen that there is an apparent relationship between the various state of quanta and consciousness; when it is examined it takes on the attributes of a waveform. When it is unexamined it seems to behave as a particle. There is evidence that consciousness and matter are subtle forms of each other. The relationship between the two lies in the inplicate order. Consciousness is present in varying degrees of enfoldment and unfoldment in all matter, which is perhaps why plasmas possess some of the traits of living things. It is because of the relationship between consciousness and matter and the holographic nature of both that every portion of the universe contains the whole; all the \"past\" and all the \"future\" also is enfolded in every point in the universe. Every cell in the body enfolds the universe."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"MATRIX III The Holoara~hic Aspects of Perce~tion Numerous studies have shown that less than 50% of what we see is actually based on information entering the eyes. The remaining SO%+ is pieced togather out of our expectations of what everything should look like. This is why we don't notice when a friend shaves off a moustache and why the house looks a little different when we return from a trip. Taking into account what we have previously discussed, what we call \"reality\" is really a large frequency domain, and our brain is a kind of \"lens\" that coverts these frquencies into the \"objective world of appearances\". Thus, the term \"frequency domain\" could be used to describe the interference patterns that compose the implicate order. When people are able to see the energy bands which surround a human being, those bands normally referred to as the \"aura\", they are seeing some of the frequency aspects of reality. The ability to see these \"bands\" is common. In their book \"Future Science\", writer John White and parapsychologist Stan Krippner describe 97 different cultures, each of which have their own designations for these bands, These bands have qualities unlike the kinds of energy with which we are normally familiar. These bands together compose a type of field - this field has characteristics which demonstrate a type of non-locality - they can manifest as an amorphous blur of energy and have, on occasion, been observed to form into three dimensional images which usually reflect thoughts of objects or ideas that occupy a prominent position in the thoughts of the person around whom they are seen- The images that have been seen in the \"bands\" around the human being are not always static. They are very often moving and sometimes manifest color. Sometimes, after subsequent checking with the individual around whom they exist, it has been found that they have portrayed a string of images that depict a \"story\" about the person; this process has sometimes gone on for a period lasting over an hour. Some of these images may be representations from the \"unconscious\" areas in the mind. Ranae of Body Freauencies Valerie Hunt, a professor at UCLA for the last twenty years, encountered a dancer who stated that she used her own energy field to help her dance. Intrigued, Hunt was inspired to make electromyograms (EMG) of the woman's muscle activity while she danced. She was also moved to study the effect healers had on the people being healed and also people who could see the human energy field, and it was here that she made some of her most significant discoveries."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"MATRIX III The normal frequencies of the electrical activity in the human brain lie between 0 cps and 100 cps, with most of the activity occurring between 0 cps and 30 cps. Muscle frequencys appear to go up to about 250 cps, and the heart goes up to about 250 cps. Beyond this, electrical activity which is normally associated with biological type functions appears to drop off. Other researchers have produced more data. Andrija Puharich indicates that the resonant frequency of a normal nerve is approximately 360 cps. Hunt discovered that the EMG could pick up another field of energy radiating from the body, much subtler and smaller in amplitude than \"traditionally\" recognized body currents, but with frequencies that averaged between 100 cps and 1600 cps. Some went even higher. Field strength seemed to be strongest in the area of the body associated with the chakras. Hunt pointed out that the energy field surrounding the body, and indeed all the body's electrical systems, is holographic in another way. Like the information in a hologram, these systems are distributed globally throughout the body, For instance, the kind of electrical activity measured by an EEG is strongest in the brain, but it can also be measured anywhere else in the body. This is also true of EKG type readings. Typically, the amplitude varies from location to location, but the frequency and patterns remain the same, One of Hunt's most startling findings was that when the focus of a persons consciousness was on the material world, the frequencies of their energy field tended to be in the lower range and not too far removed from the 250 cps of the body's biological frequencies. People who demonstrated strong psychic and healing abilities have frequencies of 400 to 800 cps in their field. People who can go into trance and apparently channel other information sources through them, skip these \"psychic\" frequencies entirely and operate in a narrow band between 800 and 900 cps. According to Hunt, there are people who exhibit frequencies far above these. She has encountered people who exbibit frequencies as high as 200,000 cps. Other Aspects of the Human Enerqy Field Frequency is not the only thing that is distributed holo- graphically throughout the field. The information the field contains can be found in every portion of the field. The energy \"bands\" not only represent, but also contain, the whole. There are a number of people who possess the ability called internal vision, in which they can see into the body as 0042"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 if it were made of glass. Australian shamans refer to this ability as \"the strong eye\" or \"seeing with the heart\". The implications of this are that the body is in actuality an energy construct and ultimately may be no more substantive than the energy field in which it is embedded. There are, however, natural substances that are reported to create this effect, as well as enhance telepathic ability. One of those substances comes from a woody vine known as Aya- huasca, which is found in Brazil. The vine contains a number of alkaloids with psychoactive properties - one of which has been called \"telepatin\", because it seems to turn those around you to glass, so that you can see through their bodies and read their minds. Lyall Watson, author of Beyond Supernature, tried it and vouches for this apparent effect. The idea that the physical body is just one more level of density in the human energy field and is itself a kind of hologram that has coalesced out of the interference patterns of the human enegy field may explain both the extraordinary healing powers of the mind and the enormous control it has over the body in general. Because an illness can appear in the energy field before it manifests in the physical body, it would appear that the impetus for illness comes from non-physical levels. A11 this suggests that the field around the body is more primary than the body and functions as a kind of blueprint from which the body gets its structural cues. Rupert Sheldrake brought this point out quite well in his book on morphological fields entitled \"The Presence of the Past: Morphic Resonance .and the Habits of Nature\" (1988, Vintage Books). Put another way, the energy field may be the body's version of an implicate order. We are essentially programming the state of health of the body. This also means that the state of health of the body can be influenced through electronic means, which we will examine in the chapter about advanced mind control applications. Hunt discovered that the human energy field responds to stimuli even before the brain does, which implies what many of us have known for a long time - that the mind is not in the brain - it is embedded in the energy bands surrounding the human body and its9 field interpenetrates the body and brain structures. If the mind is present in the energy bands, this supports another fact that many have known and some. people have suspected - that the thinking, feeling part of ourselves is not confined just to the physical body. It is probable that even time itself is not absolute, but unfolds out of the impplicate order, and this suggests that the linear division of time into past, present and future is"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"MATRIX III also another construct of the mind. All experiences are ultimately tied to neurological processes taking place in the brain, unless the individual's consciousness is functioning outside of a focus on the physical body. According to this holographic model, the reason we experience some things as external realities and other things as internal realities is due to where the brain localizes them when it creates the internal hologram that we experience as reality. Very often, the remembered image of a thing can have as much impact as the thing itself, Ask any abductee. It can have an equally powerful effect on the physiology of the body, as can the idea and process of belief, which can be critical to a person's health. The mind can even override our genetic structure - the body responds to what the mind is defining as reality. Mu1 tiple Personal i ties as Mu1 ti~le Imaqe Holoqrams Another interesting aspect of the holographic nature of the universe might involve the phenomenon of multiple personalities. There have been many scientific studies that have focussed on the physiological and neurological aspects of individuals with apparent multiple personalities. These studies have yielded some interesting data. In addition to possessing different brain-wave patterns, the sub-personalities of a \"multiple\" have a strong psychological separation from each other, each with their own name, age, memories and abilities. Mutiples can switch body conditions on and off. The different personalities respond physically to different drugs. In one case, a person with mutliple personalities was admitted to a hospital with diabetes and baffled her doctors by showing no symptoms when one of her non-diabetic personalities was in control. There is evidence to suggest that even when alternate personalities are not in control, they still maintain a sense of awareness. This essentially enables a \"multiple\" to perform \"parallel processing\", which may involve thought patterns on \"multiple channels\" simultaneously or cases where some personalities sleep while other ones perform tasks. If the \"psyche\" of a \"multiple\" is a kind of multiple image holgram, it appears that the body is one as well, and can switch from one biological state to another as rapidly as the flutter of a deck of cards. The Conce~t of \"Holocrraphic Inserts\" There could be aspects of technology that are alien-based that involve advanced holographic engineering. According to information put forth by Barbara Marciniak, there exist holo- graphic \"streams\" called \"holographic inserts\" which are essentially three-dimensional events that are inserted into"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 the common \"reality stream\" perceived by human beings. These streams, which are the equivalent (from another perspective) of a \"holographic dream\" are used to manipulate the human race -by induction of fear states which function to maintain the operative human frequency of consciousness at a level of exterior \"controllability\". There have, in addition, been numerous references to holographic projections being used as camouflage to screen alien and/or government facilities and operations from view; it would appear that this technology is quite developed; for the \"common civilian\" intruding where he is not supposed to go it would be perceived as a concrete \"reality\" and is very effective. II. MORPHOLOGICAL FIELDS . Rt the beginning of the 192OSs, at least threee biologists independently proposed that the structure, and perhaps additional aspects of living organisms and non-living forms, is organized by exterior fields: Hans Spemann (1921)- Rlex Gurwitsch (1922) and Paul Weiss (1923). During the 19309s, C.H. Waddington attempted to clarify the field concept with the idea of \"individuation fields\" associated with the forma- tion of definite organis with characteristic individual shapes. In the 19509s, he extended the field idea to the concept of developmental pathways. Today, we have compiled an overall body of information what morphic fields are: R morphic field is a non-material hyperspacial field containing potential patterns of organization that are specific to every kind of living and non-living form. They extend through and interpenetrate the \"space-timewcontinuum and are resonantly interactive on a continuous basis with the forms to which they give rise during the process of morpho- genesis. Morphic fields retain and maintain a continous species/form-specific cumulative memory which contributes to the organization, activities, and characteristics of sub- sequently generated forms. Each species and form has its own morphic field; fields of related species are similar. Within each overall field there exist subsidiary fields which form a nested hierarchy of fields. Through genetic mutation or through influence of the environment, organisms of one species may \"tune in\" on another, enabling parallel patterns of development between similar forms. Knowledge acquired through experience by members of a specific species or influnces inprinted on non-living forms can resonantly diffuse to others through the field. Because of morphic resonance, sucessfull patterns of actiyity, through repetition, show a tendency to reappear ."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 PROPOSED Slaucru~E 0 F \"One CeU Gins /AIR> o/ C A L lvCU 1 morphic fields - Norrrr riJ~onlri~rlor/ r 5 PASSED IU YIERARCHY OF ENERGY- ENERGY + MASS.

One day, a specfic species of sheep rolled across the grid to get to the other side. Within days, sheep of the same species all over the country began to do the same thing. (2) A bird called the Blue Tit was observed in a few isolated but widely separated locations pulling the aluminum caps off milk bottles to get at the milk. A short period of time.went by and birds of the same species all over England began using this method. The second example involves what we commonly consider to be non-living (but probably conscious on some level) matter. A laboratory was engaged in the growing of specific types of crystals. Other labs were also engaged growing the same type of crystals made of the same substance. In this laboratory, a single crystal mutated, producing a hybrid structure never seen before. In the other labs, their crystals also began to mutate to this same structure. The labs were widely separated geographically. Probably thousands of examples exist which support the morphic field hypothesis. Morphic fields appear to exist for planetary bodies, entire species, racial groups, famility . groups, and individual entities. Since morphic fields are hyperspacial in nature, higher order fields above the electromagnetic spectrum are able to influence them. It is theoretically possible for the morphic field of an entire race or the entire human species to be affected technologically, producing physical or genetic changes. This principle, also supported by the functional science of radionics and psychotronics, could be used to manipulate and control a species on several levels. III. NATURAL ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS Ionos~heric Cavi tv Resonance Freuuencies The planet is surrounded by a layer of electrically charged particles, called the ionosphere. The lower layer of the ionosphere starts at about 80km from the surface of the earth. It is a charged layer and is known to reflect radio"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"MclTRIX III waves. Since it is a charged layer, it forms a capacitor with the earth, with the earth being negatively charged and the ionosphere positively charged. This potential difference is evenly distributed and comes to about 130 volts per meter- The field is fairly rigid, and when our body moves, these movements are transmitted to the environment, which includes all other bodies on the planet. How? The resonant frequency of the ionospheric cavity around the earth is about 7.5 cps; this is also called the Schumann resonance, which covers the 1Hz - 30Hz range. The human body is vibrating between 6.8 to 7-5 Hz. The skeleton and all the internal organs of the body move coherently at about 7 cps- This suggests a tuned resonant system between the body and the iconospheric cavity around the earth. The Schumann resonance coincides with brain alpha freq- quencies at 8Hz. The human being and the planet system can resonate with each other and transfer energy between each other. This occurs at a very long wavelength of 40,000 km, or just about the perimeter of the planet. In other words the signal generated from the movement of our bodies will travel around the planet in about one seventh of a second through the electromagnetic field in which we are embedded. Such a long wavelength does not attentuate much over large distances. When a human body is standing on the ground under normal conditions, it is electrically grounded and acts like a sink for the electrostatic field and will distort the lines of force to some degree, Overall Geomaanetic Field Characteristics The naturally existing fields on the Earth appear to be a combination of field intercations, some with origins in space and some having origins within the Earth. The Earth is constantly in the path of high-energy particles which emanate from the Sun, known as the \"solar wind\". These particles travel through space and impact with the outer layers of the magnetic field of the planet, producing enormous electrical currents with power ranges in the billions of watts. It also results in the production of ionizing radiation (radiation that produces charged particles from the atomic structure of matter) and various electromagnetic waves in the extremely low frequency (ELF) range between 0 and 100 cycles per second (cps) and the very low frequency (VLF) range between 100 and 1,000 cps.

These are shory duration pulses of magnetohydrodynamic origin, with a field strength of from 0.2 to 1000 V/m. The second electrical micropulsation group consists of two sets, one is in the 7.5 to 8.4 Hz range and the second is in the 26 Hz to 27 Hz range, both pulsing in a group of 3 to 6 sinusoidal pulses with an interval of 0.04 to 1 second. The field strength of this second group os 0.15 to 0.6 V/m. The third electrical micropulsation group is in the frequency of 5 to 1000 Hz, and is related to atmospheric changes that occur continuouslu. Field strength for the third group ranges between a low of 0.0004 and a high of 0.5 V/m. Natural Maqnetic Fields and Micropulsations There are two main groups of natural magnetic pulsations which appear on the surface of the Earth. The first group is at pulsation frequencies ranging from 0.002 to 0.1 Hz, with amplitudes ranging from 0.004 to 0-08 A/m. The second group of magnetic pulsations range from 0 Hz to 5 Hz and have a frequency of several minutes to several hours. The amplitude of the general combined field decreases with increasing freq- uency from 0.0008 A/m at 5 to 7 Hz to 0.000000001 at 3 kHz- The Variant Geomaqnetic Field The particle output of the Sun is not constant, but rises and falls in an 11-year cycle. During periods of high activity, commonly called solar storm periods, the strength of the magnetic field of the Earth fluctuates wildly enough to cause extraneous currents to flow in power and telephone lines and disturb radio and television signals. It wasn't until 1958 during the International Geophysical Year that the magnetic envelope surrounding the planet was really investi- gated. Magnetic storms are generally classified according to their magnetic field strength. The average magnetic field strength on Earth tends to about 0.5 Gauss, although the actual value ranges between 0.35 and 0.70 Gauss. 1 Gauss equals 100 nanotesla (nt), which equals 100,000 gammas; all different units measuring the same thing. Strong magnetic storms are classified as those over-200 gammas; weak storms approximate 50 gammas-"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"There are relationships between some of the surges in magnetic intensity from the sun and changes that have been observed in human behavior. It was found in 1963 that the admissions to mental hospitals increased significantly during any week in which a major magnetic storm occurred. Even the day-to-day behavior of psychiatric patients was correlated to small variations in the geomagnetic field. Periodic Geomaanetic Polarity Reversals The concept of reversals in polarity of the Earths magnetic field has been researched adequately over the last 20 years, and geological analysis has shown that magnetic reversals also parallel extinction of various species on the Earth. Each reversal is a slow process that may take more than 10,000 years and often as long as 100,000 years. Smaller varitions exist over a period of 100 to 1,000 years. The extinction of various species occurred right after the magnetic-field reversal. If the reversal occurs following an exceptionally long period of a stable field, the species extinction is much more extensive. Research indicates that during a field reversal, the field strength does not drop to zero, but merely declines to about 50% before building back up again. In 1971, a conference was held on this subject at Columbia University, under the direction of Dr. James Hays. Hays found that six out of eight extinctions of radiolaria, a primative organism, had occurred concurrently with magnetic field reversals. Additional work linked other extinctions to the reversals. Theories about the cause for the field reversals take into account that reversals could have been accompanied by major changes in the 1-l0cps micropulsations that normally exist within the field - micropulsations that have the ability to radcically affect biological organisms - changes in these could reduce the biological efficiency of organisms. Other theories propose that the frequency changes could influence cellular reproduction and produce defective offspring. There is some evidence, according to work done at Oakland University by Abraham Liboff, that both of these theories may be valid, since present evidence from studies on the bioeffects of abnormal electromagnetic fields indicates that such long-term alterations in the frequency spectrum of the micropulsations could have major deleterious effects. It appears that biological evolution is not a random event but is in part driven by changes in the Earths natural magnetic field."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 IV. BIO-ELECTRICAL SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS Magnetically Driven Symmetry of Organic Lifeforms Work at the University of Bremen in Germany on magnetic fields indicated that the form of organic molecules could be generated in right-hand or left-handed modes simply by changing the characteristics of the ambient magnetic field, which is interesting because all organic chamicals only exist in these two mirror-image structural forms. When living organisms create amino acids and other substances, they made only one kind, either right or left-handed, but not both, The effects of each of these mirror-image forms on living systems are quite different. In Matrix I1 we discussed the alledged sensitivity of some alien species to left-handed molecular structures - this has not been verfied, nor has anyone come forth to challenge this allegation. We have theorized that some of the biological reactions that humans experience when encountering some alien lifeforms results from the variance at the boundary interface between two radically different bio- logical fields - fields which may incorporate a different spin-vector. No doubt magnetic field alterations a play an important part in the construction of synthetic lifeforms and clones. It has been stated in some literature that the sites for these cloning laboratories are chosen very carefully, based on the characteristics of the local geomagnetic field- Living systems appear to have a general facility for being able to sense small changes in their electromagnetic environ- ment without being overwhelmed by the large change. Honeybees and birds are reported to be sensitive to magnetic changes less than 1nT (10uG). In pigeons the pineal gland weighs ahout 1.5 grams - in humans about 2-grams. According to the research done by M.L.Barr in 1979 (The Human Nervous System), for an organ the size of a human pineal gland to be able to respond co-operatively to changes in magnetic field, the coherent energy of the magnetic field within the volume of the pineal gland must not be less than the random thermal energy, which means that the minimum detectable magnetic field for the pineal gland is 0-Z4nT (2.4uG). The human head appears to be the part of the anatomy that is most sensitive to changes in the surrounding field characteristics. This is very important when it comes to mind control applications, especially the ones that are currently being conducted - we'll review those in a later chapter. The fundamental nature of a magnetic field is that it can affect living systems on quantum levels. The Russian scientist Trincher discovered that water inside the living cell is in a state of maximum order, which is a state attainable in non-living systems only at absolute zero. Thus, biological superconductivity and quantum-level responses to variations in field characteristics are typical of living"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"MATRIX XI1 systems. The Josephson Effect, which can occur in super- conducting systems, but which does not depend on the presence of superconductivity (only the ability of the system to respond to the quantum of magnetic flux) does offer a possible physical connection between living systems and the weak electromagnetic fields which surround them. Circadian Rhythms Human circadian rhythms have been found to be extremely sensitive to weak ELF fields. Animals are also very sensitive in the same way. Specially trained birds in experiments done by Wever were able to tell the difference between a lOHz field and a 9Hz field- The key to biological changes using magnetic fields is that they must be pulsed, or modulated. However, living systems appear to be non-linear in their reponses to electromagnetic fields - great changes in the field do not always produce great changes in the organism. Changes appear to occur relative to specific frequencies and modulations that exceed a particular threshold specific to the effect. Bioloaical Enzymes and Macrnetic Fields The substance melatonin is linked with the generation of circadian rhythms. It also regulates the level of activity in the brain, as a whole, and is produced by the action of pineal enzymes on serotonin, one of the vital neuro-chemicals. One of 'the enzymes (biological catalysts) responsible for the syn- thesis of melotonin was shown in experiments in 1983 to be sensitive to changes in weak magnetic fields. The rate at which biological reactions proceed depends on concentrations of the various enzyme and the molecule whose chemical reactions the enzyme very specifically controls, known as the \"substrate\". There are typically 3,000 enzyme systems in a living cell. The human body has more than 1013 cells; the number of enzymes in the body is of the order of 3x1016; if their detailed reactions were simulated on a computer at the rate of one very three seconds, this would need computer time equal to the number of seconds that have elasped since the beginning of the Universe, 1017. Detailed analysis of the chemical structure of enzymes reveals that all enzymes are proteins. Proteins are made up from strings of amino acids, short chains of which are referred to as polypeptides; when the chains have a length exceeding 50 to 100 amino acids, giving them molecualr weights - greater than 500 to 10,000, they are called proteins. The chains take on a three-dimensional arrangement. Oddly, there is nothing in the chemical structure of enzymes to explain"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 their enormous catalytic power, and there is no simple connection between molecular structure and enzyme activity. The specificity of enzyme action is also not confined to living systems. In electronic terms, an enzyme-substrate system could be considered an \"amplifier\", if one regards the signal input as the amount of enzyme present and the output as the amount of reaction product formed per minute. Such an amplifying system might have a gain of 1Ol0. It was the search for a physical characteristic common to most.biologica1 materials that led Frohlich in 1975 to examine their dielectric properties. A simple definition of a dielectric would be to say that it is anything that is not a metal, The relevance of dielectrics to biological cells and tissues will be clear as soon as it is realized that there is a very high electric field across live biological membranes. This field is of the order of 107 volts/meter, far greater than anything likely to be experienced holistically by a human being. This field is strong enough to align all the macro- molecules within a biological membrane, which increases their non-linear responses to external electromagnetic fields. A better model for the situation might be in terms of oscillating dielectric dipoles. A dipole is the combination of a positive charge and a negative charge separated spatially, such as might occur on the surface of a macromolecule. Research indicates that non-linear, coherent excitations of these dielectric dipoles is possible and that this could lead to long-range interactions on a very frequency-selective basis, essential if one is to have a mechanism for the selective remote control of the chemistry going on in a particular cell of the body by a distant organ which has an overseeing function for the activities, or provides the organism with sensors for external electromagnetic fields. We can see by now that electromagnetic phenomena are important for regulation at the basic level of cell bio- chemistry. It is likely that all the electromagnetic fre- quencies from the ultra-violet to that which characterizes the lifetime of the cell are involved in a very coherent manner. Because many of the biomolecules are themselves electrically charged, acoustic vibrations and electrical vibrations are equivalent and interchangable, the only difference being in their velocity of propogation. It seems that just as living systems are able to make use of single photons, they are able to make use of single quanta of a magnetic field. If this applies, then they also have the ability to interconvert between frequency and voltage at the rate of SOOMHz per microvolt; they are able to make use of the Josephson Effect. Any cell will behave life a dielectric resonator and will have an electromagnetic field in the space around it, This field is capable of interacting with and being"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"MATRIX III influenced by fields external to it, Masnetic Field Shielding Experiments involving the shielding of living systems from the geomagnetic field (GMF) were carried out by Dubrov in 1978, but they are difficult and involve expensive shielding materials and techniques. Magnetic fields are very difficult to screen- A lmm piece of high-permeability magnetic alloy will only reduce the steady field within the enclosure to about SOnT, which is the average strength for the GMF. The shielding of ELF magnetic fields presents an even greater problem; a 150mm piece of aluminum provides some minimal degree of shielding. Human Brain EEG Signals The EEG signals which are recorded in the human brain are thought to be due to current flow in the cortex where synch- ronous interactions yield oscillations in the frequency band from 0.5 Hz to 30 Hz. These frequency oscillations a similar to the geo-electrical Schumann Waves generated in the iono- sphere, to which all organisms have been exposed throughout their period of evolution. For the purpose of EEG analysis and clinical description, the frequency band has been divided into a number of so-called rhythms. The majority of normal adults can produce the Alpha rhythm, which was, first described by Berger in 1929. This is within the range of 8 Hz to 13 Hz and is the normal basic rhythm for a relaxed person with the eyes closed. The Beta frequencies are considered to ne those from 14 Hz to 22 Hz. The amplitude of 'the beta waves is generally less than 20uV. Delta waves range from 0.5 Hz to 4 Hz and replace Alpha waves during deep sleep, anesthesia, and are also present during various meditative states involving will- ful conscious focus of attention in the absense of other sensory stimuli. Theta waves range from 4 Hz to 8Hz. They appear to be prominent in the EEGs of normal children. a as a Cellular Com~onent One of the most interesting discoveries in the last ten years that has profound implications of a biological nature is that water appears to have a memory for past exposures to highly coherent frequencies. Dr-Cyril smith in 1985 proposed that water might have a helical structure that enables it to \"remember\" frequ-encies. This capacity of water would explain how clinical responses in homeopathy can occur within seconds. Watterson in 1982 considered the effects of structure waves in water. In order to account for magnetic field effects and a"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 memory for frequency, Smith proposed that such structure waves would occupy electromagnetic and acoustical modes of propogation appropriate to a helix. These must be capable of being set up in water by the spectrum of coherent oscillations either by electromagnetic components or tincture molecules in the case of homeopathic preparations. There have been fre- quency associations with homeopathic preparations. For example, Dr, Wolfgang Ludwig in 1986 found that the frequency of Arnica lOOOx was 9.725 kHz. All this also might explain why people that are sensitive to certain electromagnetic frequencies respond when in the presence of water that has been exposed to that same frequency. Brain waves As millions of brain cells fire repeatedly many of them are combined in one ECG wave trace.

Evolution, and States of Consciousness If every person were looked at as a single cell in a worldwide brain in which the whole of life were reflected as a hologram, then the brain itself could be seen as a pattern of crystallized evolutionary intelligence which is gradually building social systems over vast periods of time. The human brain has taken about 5 billion years to develop on this 10 billion year old planet. Besides natural evolution, the human brain and physiological structure might have been affected by as many as 64 separate genetic modifications imposed on the developing human neurological structure. Some of these modifications might have been performed to deliberately limit the functional ability of the human being, The behavior of all organisms and especially the social organization of the different species of vertebrates corresponds to a progressive increase in the development of the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum. Consciousness has developed, by virtue of different areas in the structure of the brain, into seven distinct areas; each area is said to resonate with a particular vibrational frequency of the color spectrum - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. Our own consciousness itself could be composed of the same light having the same seven colors within it and seven different vibrational frequencies which shape the quality of ou r awareness. The human brain is also a prism and a receiver, filtering cosmic light into an octave through its vehicle of expression, the human body, and resonating with the seven basic colors, while the 8th level resonates with pure consciousness itself. The brain can be likened to a seed which unfolds on seven different vibratory levels, Our direct knowledge of our own brain consciousness determines our own level of evolution. The brain as a physical manifestation of these stages of develop- ment is an effect, not a cause, of the evolving levels of consciousness. These levels pre-exist within the brain. Every person's levels of consciousness are mixed , yet they separate when passing through different densities and intensities to produce the thresholds within the total experience of what our brain normally experiences as consciousness. At each stage of evolution the growth of organisms has not come from the differences in gene products but from the complex regulatory circuits which have unleashed or restrained certain activities of the organism, thus leading to the specific genetic program which selects the quantities of bio-chemical products from its immediate environment.

The signals are modulated and tuned, not to individual cells but to the whole brain's activity, which results in a selection among hundreds of thousands of paths, so that the signals will travel along specifically chosen pathways to certain areas. The preferred circuits are often habitual and are formed through the embryonic development of the nervous system and the subsequent conscious discipline of the channels. It is possible to shut off parts of the brain or to amplify other parts and create large charges. The electrical potentials can be consciously changed in the brain pathways. There is no habitual thought pattern or emotional response or typical action which we cannot change. The tuning of the brain circuits is converted into learning and memory by setting up stored patterns of potential energy in the cells of the brain through choosing specific circuits. We of ten function by habitual responses which are stored as an energy in the brain, and we call this a type of memory. This kind of memory is like an unconscious choosing process that is happening automatically. The higher conscious selection is made through the use of conscious will. Any unconscious choosing can become conscious choosing once we are aware that choices are happening and we begin to deliberately interfere with them, People who can store large amounts of electricity by raising their vital forces to higher layers also increase their thinking capacity, since the electrical charge in the brain ionizes more brain fluids, The ionization of membranes and fluids in the brain is equivalent to exciting the atoms of our brain cells to a higher threshold. The body can be changed by an act of consciousness, The secretion of brain chemicals can be controlled at will to affect our emotions and levels of consciousness simply by raising these electrical potentials and awakening millions more cells than is normally possible and getting them to switch on.

The body of a human being has one main function: to hold an electrical ionizing charge so that consciousness can express through it. The capacitance effect of the neuro- logical structures not only accumulate electrical potential but also function in an aspect that features tuning. The frequency of the whole brain rhythm depends on the tuning of the neural circuits as a whole- Meditation and other exercises open channels for more energy from higher levels of conscious- ness; it fine-tunes the brain cells to higher frequencies so that they become more able to receive and store subtle energies. The capacitance effect is increased and the brain cells hold a higher level of awareness, In this way, we enlarge our capacity, and then it is there for us to use and draw upon. The nervous system is an extended part of the amplifying circuitry of the brain. Though the nerve trunks are interpenetrating the whole body, there is no contact made between the nerves and the body, because the nervous system is completely contained within its own \"body\". In effect, we have a body within a body- Why is it important that there are two separate body systems: one body sensing the universe directly and communicating that sensation to the rest of the body which is quite separate from it and only connected by chemical reactions? The outer body acts as a huge sensitive skin, communicating with the inner body consisting of the nerves floating within it, and the nerves then communicate with the physical level of consciousness by chemical hormone transmitters- Humans take feelings produced by these chemicals as reality, without understanding that it is only one level of consciousness communicating with another. Darwin only tuned into the 1st brain in his theory of the survival of the fittest, The behavioral psychologists have tuned into the 2nd brain in the study of learned social behavior . Medical science has divided the brain strictly by lobes, rather than by function, and their pictures reflect this physiological orientation, which does not acknowledge seven brain functions not raise the question of what kind of consciousness has shaped the brain in seven parts. Timothy Leary and others have researched circuits in the brain and have arrived at conclusions which indicate seven circuits that parallel the seven brain areas; these circuits are influenced by imprinting. There are indications that this knowledge is one of the reasons why Leary was imprisoned, as intimate knowledge of the imprinting process, how to change the imprints, and knowledge of brain circuitry itself could interfere with the effort to subjugate the mass of humanity under a domination-control based system.

The benefits of the knowledge, however, contribute to the overall evolution of the society when viewed from a higher state of consciousness - that is precisely why this material is being presented to you now. The First Brain Area and Its Functioning The reptilian brain was first a sensitive piece of skin, a primitive kind of eye not sensitive to light alone but to all vibrations in nature, across all octaves, and this sensitivity can be traced in some lizards as a rudimentary pineal gland which reaches through the brain like a bulb on a stalk just under the skin. The human pineal gland also acts like an antenna, though it is buried inside the skull, The lizard experiences a.pinea1 effect of 360 degree physical sensation which human beings have lost, although we can feel that link through our consciousness provided we have awakened and activated it at the higher levels of brain activity. In the reptile, the pineal gland is a PHYSICAL sensor, whereas in man it has become a faculty of EXTRfi-SENSORY perception and has gone deep inside the skull and taken on an entirely new role. We have also inherited from this most primitive area in our brain development, the automatic reflex of stimulus- response reactions. This area of the brain represents only 6% of our brain intelligence, The reptilian brain has gradually reseeded into the protection of the skull and became differentiated into the innate human responses common to the reptilian living habits, that is, walking, swimming, crawling, swallowing, vomiting,, breathing, speech or tongue control and basic voice box (croaking), digestion, metabolism.and beating of the heart, all of which are controlled by the MEDULLA and its associated cranial nerves and the total nervous system. A11 higher animals have emotions which they store in the 2nd level of the brain, but the reptilian brain is that part which determines what part of our body will respond to direct sensory stimuli. In other words, we have to get hit before we feel it- The memory latent in the nerve cell in this part of our cerebrospinal system of sensations is fully automatic, with its own built-in primitive intelligence which is highly reactive to sensory inputs. Cells, nerves leading through the MEDULLA into the brain, and the brain dendrites generally, are all part of this system and are all sensitive to this primordial reptilian level of consciousness. Most people are more developed in this part of their. brain than in any other part. They respond to life as reptiles. They are at the mercy of each new stimulus so that soon the day is shattered into a thousand fragments and they don't know where the time has gone.

Like the powerful response to sound, which is preserved in the primitive functioning of the brain, so too our emotional response to any stimulus that comes through our senses has a power that completely swamps the clarity and logic of the head. The 1st brain is the source of our most powerful negative destructive energy, but it is also the positive source of our vitality. IMPRINTS Let's talk about brain programming. One main aspects of brain programming, as we mentioned earlier, is the idea of the IMPRINT. Lack of understanding of the changes these circuit imprints can induce and the knowledge about their persistence is responsible for most failures in communication. That is precisely why this information is suppressed, because knowledge of it represents a potential evolution in society - an evolution that is not desired by many who control our society, IMPRINTS can be looked at as \" software frozen on hardware\" in terms of the brain, which is genetically designed to accept imprint conditioning on its circuits at certain points in neurological development. These critical periods are sometimes referred to as times of IMPRINT VULNERABILITY. The IMPRINT establishes the limits or perimeter within which all subsequent conditioning and learning will occur. Imprinting creates the structure which emerges out of the Void. Each successive IMPRINT complicates the software which programs our experience and what we tend to experience as reality. The structures of the brain which are reptilian in nature also represent the 1st circuit, which has been referred to as the Oral Bio-Survival Circuit. It is imprinted by what is perceived to be the mother or first mothering object, It is conditioned by subsequent nourishment or threat, and is concerned with sucking, feeding, cuddling, and body security, It causes an unconsciously motivated mechanical retreat from anything noxious or predatory, or from any associated by imprinting or by conditioning with anything noxious or predatory. The circuit is estimated to be 3 to 4 million years old. The structure of the 1st circuit remains in the Brain Stem and the autonomic nervous system, although it is connected with the endocrine and other life-support systems of the body. Interestingly, 85% of the population have ,symptoms of a bad 1st circuit imprint. The basic consciousness of the 1st circuit is one-dimensional, and is concerned with \"what is safe\" and \"what is not safe\". In human society, MONEY is tied purposely to survival and bio-security. Welfare systems, socialism, and"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 totalitarianism represent attempts to re-create the tribal bond by attempting to make the concept of the \"state\" stand in for the gene pool. Money represents a bio-survival bind for most people. People whose reality-tunnel is governed by this circuit seem to be \"action-oriented\" people who view other people out there as numbers in an abstract thing called \"society\". They react to the pressures of the moment- People who take their heaviest imprint on the 1st circuit tend to be overweight, because this imprint determines lifelong endocrine and glandular processes. They tend to be easily threatened by disapproval of any sort, because in the \"baby-circuit\" of the brain, disapproval suggests the idea of extinction by loss of the food supply. Initial negative imprint on this area is characterized by the \"respiratory block\" noted by Wilhelm Reich, It is a chronic muscular armoring that prevents proper, relaxed breathing. Popular speech recognizes this state as \"being up tight\". Introduction of O~iate Druas as a Forced First-Circuit Reali ty-Tunnel for Population Mananement In current society, especially in the United States, different elements within the shadow government, together with the CIA, NSA, US Army Delta Forces, and other agencies, have seen fit to keep pumping heroin and opiates into the society. The rationale for this is to eliminate weaker elements of society, acquire additional funds to support covert operations, and to induce a tunnel-reality adherence to the 1st circuit level of consciousness - essentially to keep the people in a fear-based survival mode. These chemicals trigger the production of neu rochemical hormones characteristic of the 1st circuit. Re-imprintinq the First Neurological Circuit One characteristic of the 1st circuit is that when this circuit senses the concept of \"danger\", all other mental activity tends to come to a halt. This fact of crucial importance in mind-washing and brain programming. Successful re-imprinting techniques for the 1st circuit work on the body first and then the mind, Rolfing is an example.

Usually, 1st circuit problems take the form of body symptoms. The experience of message tranquilizes the 1st circuit. The Second Brain Area and Its Functioning The 2nd brain area consists of the PONS and the FOURTH VENTRICLE in the brain system, and is typified by the early mammal or paleo-mammalian brain of birds and animals. It is tuned to the storage of experiences which extend beyond the' immediate skin sensations of the 1st brain into the social dimension of our physical environment. In other words, the self-sense or identity is expanded beyond the skin to include others. The PONS is that part of the brain which began to infold and become protected as the next most primitive part of the structure of the base of the skull, immediately above the MEDULLA OBLONGATA above the spinal column at the end of the spinal cord. It is the part of our brain which gives us a more refined memory than the immediate physical sensation and makes us act together with a response similar to the herd instinct of moist animals and the seeking of group protection. Each level of brain structure have positive and negative expressions, so it is inappropriate to compare them and to criticize others for lower brain functions which in their right context are positive. Yet the limits of each level are only visible from the other levels and, in this sense, comparisons are helpful. For example, the time framework of the 1st brain consciousness, reacting to the pressure of the 0067"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 lateral ventricles cerebral aqueduct fourth ventricle fornix thalamus hypothalamus pituitary gland"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 moment, becomes very clear to someone acting in the 2nd brain. The time frame of the 2nd brain is the action of the immediate now put off to the future time of all interspecies interaction in the environment - the \"future-oriented now\". The reason action is put off and cannot happen \"now\", as in the previous 1st circuit level, is because in social contact, decisions to act are all held up pending the decisions and actions of others who all have independent wills, minds and sensations. This is the well-known delay in politics and in all social action which is put off until tomorrow. Lacking the drive of the 2nd level of brain structure, humans would not congregate in groups, The modern version of primitive 2nd circuit emotion is a paranoid response to anyone who is different from ourselves. This is why war propaganda is so successful in uniting a society into some feeling of oneness, and why the New World Order considers itself to have a chance of being successful. This is the strategy that the Bush administration uses to manipulate the bulk of the U.S. population. It is estimated that 50% of the human race has not evolved beyond a 2nd circuit controlled reality tunnel. This circuit is also responsible for the manifestation of the fear of not being in the \"in-crowd\". There is the fear that others are getting something you are not getting,, the feeling of missing out, the need for confirmation and approval from others, the need to be accepted and to belong. Rcceptance gratifies pride, which a basic psychological attribute of the individual stuck in a reality tunnel centered around the 2nd structure of the brain. This level of consciousness, when under-developed, is responsible for the lack of social feeling, exploitation of fellowman, enslaving of others, and cruelty, both to humans and other species, Those who have conscious access to the 6th and 7th levels of brain structure are able to get inside other people and feel what they are experiencing or to project what is going to happen to people in the future, whereas people in the 1st circuit and structure of the brain must wait until the events are actually happening, and then they are not likely to feel what anyone but themselves must be feeling. The 2nd level \"feel\" for others is not this quality of empathy or identi- fication as though the other were oneself, but rather is a sense of concern for \"another\", It is more of an identity by association. People functioning on the 2nd level can be selfish and uncaring, just as any people can, but the 1st level consciousness is more prone to think of people unfeelingly because they relate to people as sensory objects and they have not developed the 2nd level concern that is 0069"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 willing to reach out and acknowledge the being of another. The 2nd stage of brain evolution was necessary as a foundation for that ultimate transcendence of the physical world in which we enter into oneness with the entire universe. It also is responsible for the \"instinct to survive through posterity\", and it is a major influence on the urge to pro- create. Functionally, the 2nd circuit could be called the Anal based Emotional Territorial circuit. It is imprinted in the \"toddling\" stage when the infant rises up, walks around and begins to struggle for power within the family structure. This mostly mammalian circuit processes territorial rules, emotional cons and games, pecking order, and rituals of domination or submission. The 2nd circuit is concerned with power politics, and is triggered chemically by alcohol, which is why alcohol is promoted in human society. It causes further division which promotes control of the human population. The 2nd circuit is 500 million to 1 billion years old and is centralized in the THALAMUS. It is linked with the muscles and the voluntary nervous system. The circuit is chiefly imprinted by the perception of the nearest alpha male, which means the first perceived dominant male figure. Sometimes, the circuit is referred to as the EGO, which is a brain circuit that often mistakes itself for the whole SELF. The EGO is the imprint for the toddling and toilet training period. When you hear someone described as \"acting like a 2 year-old\", they are talking about someone who is firmly rooted in a reality tunnel of the 2nd brain and under the control of the circuit therein. The 2nd circuit has an Anal orientation, People who are stuck in the 2nd brain circuits prefer to use anal-oriented words in their vocabulary. Expressions of this level of consciousness can be seen everywhere, including in the military, and especially in boot-camp, where everyone except the training instructors is referred to as an \"ass-hole\". The activities which are centered around the 2nd circuit are based on the concept of positive feedback - and attempts to maintain a balance. This is why there is an overwhelming desire to please and pacify the training instructor in boot camp. The same reality structure is used in prisons and is generally spread in a thin layer over the structure of society in the United States. For a person stuck in the 2nd circuit, confronting a problem brings out both bullying and cowardliness."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 The The thalamus, located more or less in the center of the forebrain, helps hitiate consciousness and make preliminary classifications of external mionnation.

To adapt, we must have an organ of comparison. An organism must be able to weigh choices and make decisions. Something in our consciousness is able to gauge the differences and to discriminate similarities. The Neo-mammalian memory is represented by the Cerebellum area and contains all our lower emotional responses situated below the mid-brain. Rich in cells and with complex connections with the brain above and the spinal cord below, the Cerebellum governs the coordination of all lower functions, including special acts concerned with range, direction, rate of force of movement, and the synchronization of physical organs. This part of the brain has the capacity for analysis and comparison so that whenever we have an experience which it is able to compare, it can randomly scan the lower brain structures and pick out sensory information and emotional responses, because this structure is situated in such a way that it can use the lower two brains at the same time. This 3rd brain structure is what makes an intellectual. It makes us able to use all the logical and comparative sequential methods of analysis and to compare, contrast, differentiate and organize. It is linear in its functions and operates like a computer, and can scan, categorize and select because this part of the brain is cross-referenced and coded with all the signals entering into the first two brains. It can be used in the service of the brain's higher faculties,"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1x1 which were added at a later time in evolution, or it can remain cut off from them as nothing more than a hunting mechanism, used to rationalize any number of random actions and experiences from the lower two brain structures. Without imagination, this intellectual function is terribly dull. In an evolved person, the intellect becomes very sharp because it links with superior reasoning. Hence it was quite possible for the dull-minded scholars of the Inquisition to torture people in the name of Christ. It is also one impetus for the New World Order to destroy populations. Millions have been tortured by ruthless intellectuals who have no feelings and sensibilities above this level. Without the operation of the higher brain centers,there is a cut-off feeling of separation from the environment. This may be the origin of schizophrenia, which occurs when the Mid-Brain and the Interbrain situated above the lower three brains cannot secrete the peptides or endorphins- the chemicals which relate the self-sense to our basic sensory experience. It is this part of the brain and brain circuitry which makes us feel separate from the universe and is therefore the seat of the ego or the sense of self and the beginning of that simple self-consciousness which separates itself from the whole. Only when we see how these different levels of the brain, each rooted in a unique portion of evolutionary history, shape our perceptual reality, can we stop identifying with the lower levels of our inner third world and begin to create from the center of our being- Functionally, the 3rd level of brain circuitry could be called the Time-Binding Semantic Circuit. It is imprinted and conditioned by human artifacts and symbol systems. It \"handles\" and \"packages\" the environment, classifying every- thing according to the Local Reality Tunnel. This is what Carl Sagan views as the \"human Brain\". This circuit, unlike the 2nd circuit based on positive feedback, is based on negative feedback, and seeks a higher level of equilibrium. It is very vulnerable to the imprint and conditions in the lower two brains. It is in the 3rd circuit where time becomes conceptualized and experienced. The imprint sites for the third circuit are in the left cortex and are linked with the larynx. This is where one finds the emergence of scientific semantic rationality as a concept. Since this circuit essentially breaks up the cycles in circuits 1 and 2, it is heavily sanctioned with taboos, rules, laws and prohibitions.

Anyone who challenges them is by definition a .. . \"heretic\", a \"traitor\", or an irresponsible nut\". Dualities arising from this level of brain structure and circuitry are: Fluency or Inarticulateness Dexterity or Clumsiness \"Good Mind\" or \"Dumb Mind\" The response to a problem, when viewed by someone who has dominance in this circuit, is to \"reason it out\". It is the reality tunnel of the rationalist, what could be called the \"Third Circuit Robot\". For people stuck in this circuit, the rest of the nervous system has, for all intents and purposes, stopped growing. Third circuit problems often take the form of perplexity . People in the 3rd circuit often try to prove that much of human experience is \"delusion\", \"hallucination\", \"group hallucination\", \"mere coincidence\", \"sheer coincidence\", or \"sloppy research\". It would appear that CSISOP and many of the \"UFO experts\" fall neatly into this frame of consciousness. The third circuit-based rationalist fears people who are demonstrating intuition. All these circuits have evolved from the beginning to the point in present society. Other circuits have evolved in their use only to a small extent, and the higher circuits appear to pre-capi tulate future evolution. The Fourth Brain Circuit and Its Functioninq The fourth brain structure is composed of the Mid-Brain, the hypothalamus, the thalamus and the floor structure of the inter-brain, It is in the 4th brain structure that we can best see the close correlation between consciousness and matter, because the secretion of hormones in this brain creates the emotions we most identify with as the idea of \"me\". Just above the Mid-brain there are important nuclei concerned with the regulation of body temperature, metabolism, sexual development, sleep, endocrine secretions and their effect on the nervous system and personality. Our whole character can be changed by hormone exchange. Our evolution or stagnation hinges very strongly upon this area of the Mid-Brain and its control over our fluctuating identity. Expressed in terms of the chakra energies, you could day that the 4th brain structure regulates the energy or life- force which can only express in the chakras when they are 0075"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Medun. obIong.1. -. 6 4 .

In an intellectual, for example, the energy may be directed almost entirely through the 3rd brain structure, and only if something happened to prevent the intellect from its usual habits could it be re-directed down into the 1st chakra and be experienced as physical vitality or sexual feeling or the energy to manifest something. It might be directed upward into intuition and imagination, which would greatly enrich the intellect. The 4th brain structures control the gateway to the higher functions of the brain which can supply power to the higher centers or shut them off at will. The maintenance of consciousness in the waking state is dependent on brain level 2, sometimes called the reticular formation. Without this basic power of life-force switched on, the powerful computers of the upper levels can only go into a coma and unconscious- ness. Stimulation of the top part of this area of our brain in level 4 can rudely waken us from sleep, just as inactivity in this area puts us into a hypnogogic state we call a trance. Stimulation of its lower parts in level 2 will put us to sleep and unconscious activity of the Cerebrum while be begin to dream. Sleep is triggered by the secretions of peptides and enkephalins which built up on the 5th level above and act downwards upon the 4th level below to trigger this unconscious gateway to the mind. In states of hynosis or the twilight drowsiness that comes before sleep, these peptides act upon the Mid-Brain 4th level to shut out our conscious mind and transfer our activity to the higher regions of the brain. What makes the 4th brain structure a control center for the rest of the brain? It's central location between the three lower and the three higher levels makes the Mid-Brain a kind of crossroads where our consciousness can choose whether to cling to the stability of its oldest and time-proven brain circuits or to push forward in the direction of its future evolution. The Mid-Brian connects the PONS on Level 2 with the Inter-brain above it on Level 5, which links Level 4 with the hemispheres. The Mid-Brain of Level 4 is continuous with the underside of the Inter-Brain and is joined with the optic thalamus, which forms the floor of the 3rd ventricle in the center of the Inter-brain. The ceiling of the Mid-Brain is the floor of the 3rd ventricle in the Interbrain in Level 5, is sometimes referred to as the Cave of Brahma by various Sanskrit texts. The Hid-Brain is an important relay center for sensory impulses passing to the various computers surrounding the walls of the 3rd ventricle. Because the Mid-brain is located exactly in between the higher and lower brain structures, we feel it as the center of our bsing."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"MaTRIy 111 In Yoga, the 4th level of consciousness is called the \"heart center\" and is a central focus for feelings coming from all other parts of the brain as well as the corresponding plexi in the lower nervous system where we feel our \"isness\". Because of this, the heart center is also the area where we feel threatened or confirmed in our being. Our feeling of possessiveness and our sense of lack, which are related to the storing up of vital forces in our body, all the feelings that have to do with insecurity and security, are controlled by this part of our brain. This part of the brain, also called the hypothalamus and thalamus, also controls our use of fat and water. Fats stores the body's surplus oxygen, and water is the liquid crystal in which all the chemical reactions of the body take place. The time framework for our 4th level feelings is past, present, and future since our feelings of insecurity respond to all three lower brain structures and go back and forth in time in a linear fashion much like the 3rd brain hunting for a slot. The 3rd brain, arranging things in the logic of past, present and future appears more mechanical, but really the 4th brain structure is just as much a computer even though it may not seem so because it is shifting in the realm of FEELINGS. The 4th brain transfers its feelings of insecurity to the entire body and all other parts of the brain because the 4th level at the center of the brain is cross-referenced and wired to all other levels of our brain, both old and new parts which are all in a state of expectancy whenever we fall in love or become attached to anything. The action of the hypothalamus on personality changes in humans can be seen by its power to control the pituitary gland at the front end of the Cave of Bramha. The hypothalamus, sitting on the floor of the Cave is connected by a fine network of capillaries which pass polypeptides which command the unconscious centers of the nervous system which regulate temperature, emotions, sleep, fear, rage and bliss. Our feelings do not stairstep neatly f tom high to low but affect each other by overlapping positive and negative vibration, cascading from level to level, by virtue of the central relay station called the \"heart\". The process is not a linear one but a circular one ( a feedback loop) which comes through the filter of the thalamus in the roof of the midbrain that forms the floor of the Cave of Brahma. The control of our feelings of security and well-being in the thalamus center are polarized with our emotional fear and anger in the hypothalamus. This control at the level of the 4th brain is determined by our thought life and the choices we make on the next level, Level 5, where higher ideals overwhelm the primitive threat to our emotional"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 security and cause us to choose the outwardly less hostile response to threat even though inwardly we are feeling like murder. Each level has its own type of feeling. One can feel insecure at any level, yet the 4th brain structures feeling insecurity is unique to itself. This is why when a person thinks that they are feeling this or that, it is hard to unravel the complexity of feelings. The heart center is the central focus of our feeling of BEING, rather than our thinking or sensing or socializing which occur on the lower three levels. Functionally, the 4th structure circuit could be termed the \"Socio-Sexual Circuit\". It is imprinted by the first orgasm and mating experiences at puberty and is conditioned by taboos. It processes sexual pleasure, local reality tunnel definitions of \"right and wrong\", reproduction, adult-patental roles and sex roles, and nurturing of the young. In this society, the circuit contains a lot of inherent \"guilt\" concepts embedded in the emotional matrix. There is an acute consciousness of Time, and the circuit loops back into Tribal Linear Time of the 2nd circuit. The location of the circuit is in the left Neo-cortex. Dualities present as concepts in the circuit are: Obedient or Disobedient Solid Citizen or Sexual Outlaw Parent or Rnarchist When people firmly rooted in a 4th circuit reality tunnel confront a problem, the problems often transmute into guilt associations and their solutions to problems often will involve a \"moral\" solution. This also reflects a part of the psychology of the U.S. political system. Having seen the inter-connections and overlapping of the chemical emotions, social emotions, intellectual emotions and the emotions of our being at the 4th level, we can now proceed to discuss the Sth, 6th and 7th Levels. The Fifth Brain Ciruit and Its Functioninq The 5th brain structure is composed of the Inter-Brain, The Third Ventricle and the hollow area known as the Cave of B rahma . The region of the third ventricle in the 5th level of functioning is the very important concept-making and idea- producing development of the brain, and everything from here on is built around it.

The third ventricle is the cavity of the Inter-brain which has been called the Cave of Brahma. It passes between the two optic thalmi which make up the floor and walls of the Inter-brain. Its roof is formed by the choroid plexus. At the front of the cavity is the pituitary gland and at the rear is the pineal gland, both very important to our perception. The third ventricle communicates with the two lateral ventricles which extend into the frontal lobes of the right and left hemispheres, and the rear end of the lateral ventricles extends into the occipital lobes of the cortex at the back of the hemispheres. It is this central part of the brain evolution which enables us to store up higher abstractions and thoughts in our memory and to process new experiences. revive old emotional scars, recall deep fears and dreams. These higher centers of control on the 5th level of function determine how we shall respond to the signals, feelings, pains, and pleasures coming to us from the lower four levels of the brain. Without this conceptual machinery to process our thoughts and primitive emotions, our organism would be like any other animal, only aware of the emotional chemical hormone releasing its response to stimuli. We would know pain but not the meaning of it. We would be able to communicate but we would not use any words or remember any thoughts and our internal life would be conditioned by the environment. Idealism as we know it would be absent from life. Without the 5th brain structure we would not be able to experience devotion or higher types of love not analyze our emotions. We would not be able to compare them with previous experiences and memories recorded in the lower brains. The comparing mechanism of the 5th brain structure is exactly opposite to that of the 3rd brain. The conceptual faculty of the 5th brain structure sees in terms of whole concepts. This is why the higher kinds of spiritual love can only be experienced through the later developed portions of the brain. The time framework for this brain structure is the PAST because to have an experience and begin to reflect on it and think about it is already time past. The moment you begin to think about it, it is already in your memory. The 5th level is an integrative function, capable of bringing together and comparing many concepts and patterns of higher emotions, capable of forming judgments of how life ought to be and making models and estimates of reality, Whereas the 4th brain is concerned with eating to obtain vital force, the function of the 5th level is the digestion of emotional \"food\". We take meaningful experiences of patterns from the external situation and compare them with what we have already internally stored in memory. This is the level of the"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1x1 brain which integrates ideas. In the Third Ventricle, the Cave of Brahma, lies the potential to become that Cosmic Consciousness which this level of functioning is able to glimpse and worship. The only way to do it is wipe out the genetic memory inherited not only from this lifetime but from many incarnations and biological successes and failures in the evolvement of the world of flesh and matter. You must wipe the mind clear so that it frees it up and it becomes new-born, a new vehicle, able to perceive things as they really are, without the constant checking against the storehouse.of memory. The kind of mind that has been freed of options also has been freed of memory and can put new memories in. Functionally, the 5th structure circuit can be called the \"Holistic Neuro-Somatic Circuit\". It is imprinted by ecstatic experience. It processes feedback loops, somatic sensory bliss, feeling \"high\", etc. Tantra yoga is concerned with shifting consciousness entirely into this circuit. The circuitry does not manifest in all human beings. It began to appear about 30,000 years ago. It is in this circuit where the nervous system begins to direct the body. Structurally, it is bound to the right cortex and is connected to the limbic elements of the 1st circuit and the genitalia. Some 5th circuit consciousness is triggered by prolonged sex play, pranayama breathing , and cannibis. Fifth circuit bliss includes the ability to heal disease. The fact that this circuit is chemically triggered by marijuana is the main reason its use is discouraged in our culture. Some 5th circuit experience is produced when a person undergoes voluntary isolation in a flotation tank. It is estimated that there will be major changes involved on the planet on a social level when 51% of the population reaches the ability to achieve consciousness in this level. The 5th level and the levels above are preparing us for extra-terrestrial migration. The Sixth Brain Circuit and Its Functioninq The 6th brain process which controls and overshadows the 5th level storing of memory and unconsciously decides how we shall respond and identify in any given situation is loosely called \"intuition\". When we use our intuitive threshold of consciousness our brain responds to situations from subtle inner feelings and perceptions which get filtered through our gridwork of previous knowledge and experiences stored in the lower brains. There are several kinds of intuition, but the 0082"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"MATRIX III"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"kind everyone has is \"knowing without forming concepts\". Hunches or premonitions that later manifest in apparent coincidences are common ways that people awaken to this level of perception which not only governs ESP but places each of us on the threshold of higher consciousness. Most people do not know what \"higher consciousness\" is; they only know what lower consciousness is and called it \"normal\". Level 6 evolves a wider kind of consciousness that is capable of transforming the quality of awareness on all the five levels below it. In most people, the 6th level is only an inner sense that keeps us in .balance physically, recognizes what we see and hear, and puts our knowing into some form. In others, this 6th structure of the brain can open to a marvelous and wondrous kind of psychic knowing which goes on at a far deeper level than thoughts or concepts - a level where our receptivity attracts an insight, like a revelation which can surprise us as much as.anyone else. Most people do not know that this psychic faculty must be trained as.any other physical faculty if it is to work correctly. One aspect of 6th level \"knowing\" is perception of the future. Level 6 and Level 7 are closely linked in the kind of power they give us to shape our consciousness, since the future is the unfolding of events which are being programmed in the \"total mind\" of the 7th level above. The power we have to receive information through images is the power of 6th level intuition to receive a non-sensory sensation or impression from the 7th level and then store it in our 5th level memory. That is, we can have information about an event that from a lower level of consciousness hasn't happened yet and store it in our memory so that when it happened we'd say \"Yes, I know that already\". The cerebral hemispheres of Level 6 are each divided into three lobes in the left hemisphere and three lobes in the right hemisphere and the 7th brain structure is another pair of lobes which we call the frontal lobes, which are situated above the lobes of level 6. Level 7 governs our higher abstractions and imagination. Each lobe of the cerebral brain has a different function. The frontmost lobes are the Parietals, which are for our use of inner vision. The back lobes, the occipitals, govern our sense of sight and the focussing of sighted objects. The middle two lobes are the temporals, which govern and arrange our conceptual speech, our listening and our physical balance. Concepts have to be joined together holistically from all of our sensations from the separate senses acting together. It is this part of our brain surrounding the inner vision of the parietals that raises our sensory perceptions of the environ- ment around us to a higher level of abstract ideas and gives us the feeling of knowing."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 The 6th evolutionary stage of the brain makes possible two distinct methods of visualizing, both of which are quite different from the imaging of the imagination on level 7. The occipital lobes make possible our sense of sight in the external environment, whereas the parietals make possible the inner \"seeing\" of the intuition. Together they make the process of seeing an entirely different experience from the animals. The underdeveloped person who has not yet switched on the capacity of the 6th level brain structures sees only with the outer vision, just like the animals- It is the pituitary, contained within the 6th brain, triggered by the parietals, that switches on a supply of endocrine chemical hormones to the areas in the frontal lobes, rear lobes, throughout the brain, and to the blood stream constantly bathing the brain cells, which triggers the 6th level perception throughout the brain as a whole. These hormones activate the intuitive awareness that can transform our brain function. The peptides which trigger the intuitive awareness, called enkephalins, become psychologically active when they are released into the Cave of Brahma from the pituitary and hypothalamus. Only when this occurs do we become aware that we are aware., the significant achievement of the 6th level of CO~~C~OUS~~SS~ The visual cortex at the back of the brain allows us to focus on objects and draws the sensations from the eye back into the head to the area of the occipitals, where we experience shape and color. The sense of seeing light, its shapes and forms, is also processed simultaneously by the various thalami situated around the walls of the Cave of Bramha acted upon by the pituitary and parietal functions, The external and internal visual systems interact normally unless you close your eyes or have blinders on and shut them off. When this happens, the inner vision system operates independently from the visual cortex which focuses light- The most important way we can use our \"inner eye\" visual system is to realize that it is fed our of the periphery of the retina and literally sees out of the corner of our eyes, We can practice looking out the corners of the eyes to stretch this visual system. This inner sight can be developed where you can seen for 360 degrees around you. With the inner vision you see with your entire being, with every cell and atom of your body. Your inner vision is even coupled to your ears, which take over to locate your position unconsciously in the environment. The purpose of various disciplines is the withdrawal of consciousness from the lower brains into the higher to stimulate the functioning of the pituitary and the 0085"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"MhTRIX III hypothalamus. When this fore-brain area is activated, the inner seeing develops and takes control over the rest of the brain. The seer becomes master of himself and all the lower functions render service to the seer who is receiving direction and guidance from the 7th level above. When the internal functions of the brain fulfill their purpose and become linked with the whole, a harmonious resonance sets in between all the levels and between the inner and outer environment. This 6th brain structure is the seat of the higher non-sensory pleasure center. It has been found experimentally that stimulation of the fore-brain bundle of nerves near the pituitary gland, which pass through the hypothalamus, gives animals the highest rate of self- stimulation rewards. The same area is stimulated in humans during meditation or the fixation of consciousness on this part of the brain, and brings blissful states which exert a powerful influence on human behavior. If you dream in color or can close your eyes and see distinct images or colors, it is indicative that your 6th level has begun to function and become sensitized to the impressions from the level of imagination above. Functionally, the 6th brain structure circuit could be called the collective neurogenetic circuit. It is imprinted by bio-electrical stresses. It is concerned with processing DNA-RNA feedback systems and is \"collective\" in that it contains-access to the whole evolutionary script, past and future. The operation of the 6th circuit indicates that it is receiving signals from the neurons themselves. The Chinese know this area as the Great Tao. In Theosophy, it is the access point to what they term the Akashic Records. If you are noticing more synchronicity and apparent . coincidences in your life, it is also an indication that you are tapping into 6th circuit potentials, since synchronicity demonstrates that everything is part of one thing. The 6th circuit is a collective DNA circuit. The Seventh Brain Circuit and Its Functioning The 7th system of the brain is centered in the frontal lobes on a physiological level. It involves the imagination and also involves the brain becoming aware of itself, It can functionally be describes as the \"Metaprogramming Circuit\", which is imprinted by advanced disciplines. In Tibetan Buddhism, it is called the White Light of the Void. From a viewpoint of the 7th circuit, 3rd circuit reality maps become comic and relativistic. There is perception of infinite realities. It is a creative Void which represents cybernetic consciousness, in which the programmer begins to program himself."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1x1 The fact that our consciousness can operate on seven distinct levels without our consciously knowing that all images and thoughts are ultimately annihilated after they pass the 7th level, is a humiliating thought for most people who think they have this whole communication thing pretty well wrapped up. To accept that each individual in reality passes into a black hole would be considered by most people a figment of the imagination. Yet if we think about it, that is what happens to all of our thoughts - they pass into the black hole of consciousness in which all things in the material world and all their patterns and images are ultimately experienced and then disappear, leaving only a memory. You become the path. The center of your being becomes the nucleus, the Source itself, radiating to itself its own light- Once you joint with the Source in that kind of feedback, then you become the source; there is no separation between the Source, the signal, the receiver, and the sender. The only way to get to that space is to tune to that Source and wait for the answering blessing. The Source is looking for the conscious response from the creation, a response inward to the nucleus, in order to establish a clear line of communication, A Model of Conscious and the Seven Dimensional Planes According to William Tiller Recording to William Tiller, a physicist at Stanford University, there exists model of consciousness which takes into account the knowledge obtained through various Yogic disciplines, as well as the holographic aspects inherent in the structure of reality. It is a different, perhaps a transitional, way of illustrating the multidimensional aspects of the universe as related to human beings, In Tiller's view, humans are essentially the elements of Spirit that are multiplexed to aspects that he refers to as Divine. His model of consciousness has been called the Lattice Model of Consciousness. In this model the Spirit, in order to have a mechanism for experiencing, has Mind embedded within it. Mind is seen as the builder, and in order to have a learning experience, Mind imbedded within itself two inter- penetrating conjugate frames of reference in the universe which he calls the positive and negative space/time frames. Springing from these is substance, which takes on various structural forms which have function. Sheldrakes work on morphogenetic fields seems to apply to this model in a holistic way. From this kind of modeling, we can see what is meant by the statement that the brain \"is in\" the mind but the mind does not have its origin in the brain, The mind is everywhere (frequency rather than distance is localized) and in every- 0087"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 thing to some degree or another depending on the dimensional nature of the interaction. The brain, in this view, is a spacially localized object that overlaps certain aspects of the mind. How does the brain function when we do things like remote viewing? Certainly the holographic nature of reality explains a lot; at the same time our consciousness is certain position coordinates within the brain, it is also in inter- active communication at the negative space/time level with something at another set of coordinates. Everyone has this capacity. It is just a grid correlation between frequency information and distance infurmatiom. It is not unreasonable because of the Fourier Transform relationship. Take a look at the illustration below: The above illustration is the kind of picture that would arise if we expressed a representation of seven dimensions of radiation according to Tiller's viewpoint. In his view, there is a temporal aspect, presumably bound to a time-track, and an indestructable aspect to the human being. In this model,. there is the Spirit, three levels of mind (instinctual, intellectual and spiritual) which relate loosely to three sections of the brain (the root brain, the right and left cortex, and the frontal lobes), etheric substance, physical substance, and the astral level, which he views as a transitional domain in which our Being is contained between periods of physicality, which is usually known as \"reincarnation\". In this system, there can be energy intercations between these different levels so that if one level is perturbed, a ratchet effect can cause energy trains to travel to different dimensions and one can experience phenomena developing at different locations, ficcording to Tiller, at the three-dimensional level we think primarily in terms of electrical and magnetic energies,"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 although there are many types of energies which function in a sort of spacial lattice. These energies, according to this model, function much like the electrons within a crystal lattice in that they form into energy bands.

Within this framework, there are various contrasts between matter in its physical form and matter in a slightly higher vibrational rate in the etheric form. A chart will help you see the relationship according to this model.

The connection would be one of resonance rather than radiation. 4.In the words of Princeton physicist John Wheeler, \"I think that through out own act of consciously choosing and posing questions about the universe, we bring about in some measure what we see taking place before us.\" 5.In 1964, physicist J.S.Bel1 emphasized that \"no theory of reality compatible with quantum theory can require spatially separated events to be independent.\" 6.Whenever two or more sets of waves intersect, holographic effects are possible. Since everything warmer than absolute zero is constantly producing wave fields, and every organized combination of particles is also broadcasting its own unique fields, the number of intersecting sets of waves approaches infinity. Theoretically, some sort of super hologram could be made at any spot in the universe that would contain informa- tion about the whole universe from that vantage point. 7. Dr Carl Pribram of Stanford University: \"A hologram arises in any system, whether optical, computer, or neural.\" 8.A \"probability wave\" is a mathematical formulation that exists in n-dimensional space- Probability waves are continuously being used in real experiments that yield real results; x particles can be described in 6x dimensions in n-dimensional space. 9.Definitions: Holonomic - in the nature of a hologram.

It always works initially in terms of structure rather than of the material through which the structure manifests itself. It is primary and irreducible, and is not necessarily lodged in conscious thought or will, although conscious will can be an instrument of intentionality. Effective intentionality springs not from Ego, but from Identity, which transcends categories such as \"body\" and \"mind\"- Identity exists in the NOW, in the individual immediacy of an occasion. As long as you can envision something, you can do it. The practice entails creating a sense of the event that is vivid and fully realized, which is an occasion in itself; a state of focused surrender. Intense effort becomes effective only through total surrender, during which intentionality can alter structure. 18.In the current society in the United States, a \"stable\" society requires \"suppression or voluntary renunciation of unlimited individual power or, at least, an implicit consensus about just what power can be used or tolerated.\" 19.The present moment, the NOW, contains an element of genuine novelty, and the \"future\" is never wholly predictable.

The world power structure makes use of belief systems to manipulate the population. What exactly is belief? The definition of belief that is given in Webster's Dictionary is: 1.The state of believing; conviction that certain things are true; faith, especially religious faith. 2.Trust or confidence, as in the belief in ability, 3.Acceptance of something as real. 4.Anything believed or accepted as true- 5.An opinion; expectation; judgment 6.Creed or doctrine. In addition, the definition of the word believe reveals additional meanings: 1.To take as real or true. 2.To have confidence in the promise of another. 3.To suppose; to expect; to assume, It does not take much thought to realize that the concept of belief never reflects actual experience. On the other hand, if something is in your experience, you have no need to \"believe\" in it. What does this really tell us? Is not the act of \"believing\" actually a process of convincing yourself of something you have yet to know and understand in your experience? If you experience, then you know. The act of \"belief\" results in an individual becoming vulnerable, in their terms, to manipulation. There is a variance between the concept of belief and \"knowing\" that is based in experience. Many of the concepts and ideas that form the basis for the society in which we live are based on \"beliefs\" that have been presented as \"reality\" and \"common sense.\" If you actually ex- perience something, then you have no need to \"believe\" it, it simply \"is\", because it is within your knowingness."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Take a piece of paper and divide it in half with a line vertically. Label the left side \"beliefs\" and the right side \"experience\". Take some time and fill the left column with the beliefs you have about as many things as you can think of. Now, how many things in the left column appear in any form in the right column? Get the message? How much energy and focus are you devoting to things that are not in your experience? The use of belief systems, which form \"reality tunnels\" for those using the belief systems, are the source of a great number of problems in our society - problems which, by their nature, always manifest themselves in dualistic ways of viewing experience. If you experience something, it simply \"is\". It could be defined \"as\" something by virtue of a belief system, but the experience itself does not contain any intrinsic aspect of anything other than itself. Two people could look at something in front of them and sat that what they are looking at is \"good\", \"bad\", \"ridiculous\", \"smelly\", or any other descriptive word. Each of those people is projecting those \"qualities\" on what they are perceiving and equating their projection with the nature of the object itself . Their projections conform with the reali ty-tunnel that is built around the belief systems that they have - the belief systems that form a gridwork that everything they perceive is viewed through. Let us hypothetically examine two individuals from American society. The first person is a factory worker who could be described as a hard-working Irishman who has a .family of four. The second person is an African American who works as an executive in an insurance company and has two children. He is married to a Caucasian woman who comes from a large family with a domineering manipulative mother. What kind of a reality tunnel might each of these people have? Let's see. The first individual might have these beliefs which form his reality-tunnel through which he views the external environment: 1.The \"ethic\" of a hard days work for a day's pay. 2.Beliefs of the Roman Catholic Church 3.Against abortion and \"pro-life\" 4.The \"democratic way\" 5.A little alcohol helps the digestion I. . 6,All \"blacks\" are inferior\" The second individual might have these beliefs: 1.All \"whites\" are inferior 2.Beliefs of a Protestant Religion 3,For abortion and \"pro-choice\" 4.The \"republican way\" 0101"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"MATRIX rrr 5-Against the use of alcohol 6.Believes that \"the end justifies the means.\" Are these two individuals likely to \"agree\" on anything from their respective reality tunnels? Not likely. Each of them is viewing the world around them through a \"gridwork\" which is comprised of \"beliefs\", their beliefs, the beliefs of their parents, the beliefs of their religion, the beliefs of their political parties, etc. Suppose each of these people switched places and each was born to the parents of the other. Each of them would take on the \"beliefs\" and reality-tunnel of the other, You can see that belief systems and the \"gridwork\" which is composed of them is independent of the individual entity, and therefore an \"artificial construction\" composed of a series of dualities which can never be \"resolved\", since within each reality- tunnel, each of them is \"correct and true\". Each person can view the \"same thing\" and come up with different results in their perception. Therefore, the object viewed has no meaning except that which the perceiver gives it. How does a child view the external environment before the belief systems are imposed? It views them \"as it is\", without beliefs or judgment, The Is-ness Aspect Because individuals equate the \"gridwork\" interpretation of their exterior reality with the reality itself, it creates problems. What something \"is\" is equated with what it \"appears to be\" by virtue of the \"gridwork\" of programming, and does not take into account the idea of existence without judgment and belief systems- Obviously, things and events exist in a way that is independent of all this. Because of this apparent problem in perception, some people have proposed a solution. This happened in 1933 when Alfred .. - Korzybski made the proposition that 1s of identity\" (taking the form of \"X is a Y\") be removed f ->m use within language. Examples of this are \"the universe is a giant machine\", \"Joe is a Communist\", \"Mary is a dumb file-clerkw- In 1949, David Bourland proposed the abolition of all forms of the words \"is\" or \"to be\" and proposed the use of operational phrases that talk about what actually happened in space-time. The weakness of Aristotelian \"isness\" or \"whatness\" statements lies in their assumption of indwelling \"thingnessU- An example would be when a doctor tells us that opium makes us sleepy because it has a \"sleep-producing property in it\". By contrast. a operational statement would 01 02"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 define precisely how the structure of the opium molecule chemically bonds to specific receptor structures in the brain. In simpler terms, the Aristotelian universe assumes an assembly of \"things\" with \"thingness\" inside them, where the other approach assumes a network of structural relationships. The example of the doctor does not seem nearly as comical as the theology promulgated by the Vatican, which says that \"things\" not only have indwelling \"thingness\" but also have external appearances. This \"explains\" the Miracle of the Transubstantiation in which a piece of bread changes into the body of a man who lived 2,000 years ago. In other words, the \"thingness\" of the bread \"is\" Jesus Christ, Since the brain does not receive raw data, but edits data as it receives it, we need to understand the software the brain uses. The use of the word \"IS\" sets the brain into a medieval framework that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to understand modern problems. This might serve to explain the human tendencies which contribute to most of the hostility on this planet, notwithstanding other external influences. Apologists for certain authoritarian/dogmatic groups, examples of which might be the Vatican, the State Departmen-t, and the Politburo, spend most of their time constructing \"proofs\" that anybody who does not share their reality tunnel has serious mental or moral defects or \"is\" a liar, One of the main functions wi thin our government is to sociologically preserve and encourage this mode of perception in order to continue the practice of dividing the population against itself, limiting human progress and evolution. A11 aspects of the society, through the media, are geared to perform the task of constant reinforcement of this mode of perception- The Conce~t of Premature Certainty \"The UFO Verdict\" by Robert Schaeffer contains the premature certainty implied by the title. Mr. Schaeffer knows what UFOs \"really are\" -- they \"really are\" hoaxes and hallucinations. Most areas of investigation related to UFOs and aliens appear to contain similar lines of thought. Books with titles like \"Abductions- The Mystery Solved\" and titles with a similar line of logic seem to be based on premature certainty, speculation, and just plain lack of sufficient knowledge and research. People generally tend to ignore the quantum \"maybe\" because traditional politics and religion have conditioned and trained people to act with intolerance and premature certainty. So many UFOs go past so quickly that they never graduate from the \"maybe\" state to the \"identified\" state. However, there is a vast amount of data that has been gleaned from events that have not gone by quickly- 0103"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Understanding these principles can decrease dogma, intolerance, compulsive behavior, and hostility and may increase openness, continuous learning, growth and empathy. A Different Look at Mu1 tiple Personalities The Russian mystic Gurdjieff claimed that people contain multiple personalities. The \"I\" who toils at a job does not seem the same \"I\" that gets angry for no evident reason or the \"I\" that makes love with joy and passion. Every person lives in a different holistic tunnel reality. All of these separate personalities also live in a different tunnel reality within that holistic tunnel reality. Electroencephalograms seem to indicate that there are distinct brain wave patterns for each \"personality\". These separate \"personalities\" have been defined as \"state specific information systems\". Not only to people show different personalities when drunk and sober, for example, but there are different information banks (or memories) in these states. Emotional states seem part of a circular-casual loop with brain chemistry. The separate \"personalities\" or information systems within a typical human seem to fall into four main groups, with four additional groups appearing in a minority of individuals who have engaged in one form or another of neuro- logical self-research or metaprogramming. These groups can be viewed in terms of the consciousness and behavior of people when functioning through different areas in the brain which correspond to the different neurological circuits covered in Chapter 3, which covered seven brain circuits. The eighth . circuit, as it were, could be looked at as functioning in pure consciousness without any \"gridwork\" composed of habits and beliefs. The Triple Plap: Security. Sensation and Power These three elements reflect the first three or four areas of the brain through which awareness is focussed, and these elements are the mainstay of the cultural deception thrust on entities using a physical organism for interaction on a third density frequency . Security: Relates primarily to the first two and secondarily to the third structure area in the human brain. Relate to food, shelter and proximity of friendly individuals. Sensation: Relates to all the brain areas but concentrates on amplification of the physical senses and identification of the physical senses as the only information source of CO~SC~O~S~~SS. 0104"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"MATRIX III Power: Relates primarily to focus on the first two brain areas and secondarily to the third.

Psycho-Social Resul ts of bddictions to Security. Sensation and Power Addiction to all three modes results in constant driving compulsiveness and fear of loss. In addition, each of these modes manifests the following additional effects: Security: The focus of conscious attention is on the \"past\" or the \"future\", which yields unlimited \"possibilities\" to \"worry about\". Sensation: Repeated enjoyment of a specific sensation produces \"boredom\". Individuals are culturally conditioned to interact with people and events in terms of \"past\" experience, instead of experiencing people and events \"as they are\". In addition, individuals are culturally conditioned to \"react\" to everything. Power: Humans are culturally conditioned to maintain a condition of being \"caught up\" in \"defending\" them- selves and maintaining \"control\" over others. Pro-jection and Res~onsibi 1 i tv Humans are culturally conditioned to use various \"ego- defense mechanisms\". One of the most used mechanisms is that of projection. There are many examples that we could give that illustrate how this is used, leading to the disempowerment of the individual. The use of projection is one of the primary psychological disorders in human society. (1) From a Social Consciousness Viewpoint: \"When I went to the store, Joe said ..., and made me mad. *. (2) From a viewpoint of more consciousness: \"When I went to the store, Joe said .... and I upset myself because I reacted to what- he said in a certain way. Not wanting to admit that it was my reaction, I projected the responsibility for that reaction on Joe and said earlier that \"he\" \"made me mad\", when in fact I am responsible for .. my own anger."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 (3) From a viewpoint of even more consciousness: \"When I went to the store, Joe said .-.., which did not disturb me in any way, because I understand Joe's state of consciousness, and I am not viewing Joe based on past habitual thought patterns and expectations, but viewing him as he is, a loving being who is in the process of growing in awareness. I recognize that nothing has any meaning except what meaning I give it, and I accept Joe the way he is, without judgment, \" IF YOU FEEL THAT SOMETHING \"AFFECTS\" YOU, IT IS A PROJECTION. Notice that the growing awareness in the above examples is resulting in the individual becoming more conscious. Go to a grade school sometime and see the social results of projection and how much disarray it causes. With projection of meaning also comes projection of responsibility for the state of ones consciousness, which results in a state of social disempowerment. What state-are you choosing to operate in? What would society be like if people \"grew up\" in consciousness? Would there be less division between people? Of course. Would the medical and psychological services in the society reap less profit? Of course. There is no profit in mental health, much less physical health. Add the other ego/image psychological defense mechanisms to the list, and you have quite a repertoire, a repertoire that is understood by the medical and psychological pro- fession, yet various means of encouraging cultural growth in consciousness are deliberately avoided. Understanding and dealing with projection and other psychological factors is discussed later on in the book. Pro-jection Encouraqed BY the Media An interesting example of projection can be seen in a commercial for Nu-Skin skin creme, in which it is said: \"Ten years ago you didn't worry about the impact of the environ- ment on your skin (referring to sunlight and ultraviolet), Now you're more sensitive.\" This suggests to the viewer that it is not really the environment that is changing through neglect; it is \"really\" the consumer who is changing. Similar lines of \"logic\" are pervasive in commercial advertising and all media material released for public consumption. The Biosocial Filter of Consciousness The effect of society is not only to funnel fictions into our consciousness, but also to prevent the awareness of reality. Every society, by its own practice of living and by the mode of relatedness, of feeling, and perceiving, develops"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"MATRIX III a system of categories which determines the forms of awareness present in the society. This system works, as it were, like a socially conditioned filter; experience cannot enter aware- ness unless it can penetrate this filter. Experiences which can not be filtered through remain outside of awareness - they remain essentially \"unconscious\". The bio-social filter is made up of the influences and behavior patterns concerned with language, ethics, taboos, logic, rules, etc. DUALISMS WITHIN SOCIETY I-The First Dualism: The first dualism which occurs is relative to the passage of consciousness into the third density. Mind, being pure consciousness, is never conscious of itself, and so is unconscious; it is unconscious in two similar yet slightly different senses: unconscious because we are culturally conditioned to be ignorant of its \"existence,\" and unconscious because we cannot know it dualistically - we can only know Mind by being it, and in no other way. The very root \"layer\" of the unconscious is the universe itself. Since society operates outside of Reality (which is non-dualistic), the Mind cannot be made conscious when consciousness is in a dualistic mode. The first dualism severs the unity of subject and object, of self and other, of organism and environment- Most people are unaware that what we are is Mind. The experience of Mind-only is always present - it is in truth the only experience ever-present; due to the first dualism, it is repressed, ignored, and forgotten. The self vs. other aspect of the first dualism assists the generation of the Ego. II.The Second Dualism: The second dualism appears to be the flip-side of the first. It severs the unity of \"life\" and \"death\", \"past\" and \"future\", and hence propels man into a life of time, thereby obscuring and rendering unconscious the awareness of the present moment, the NOW. The first and second dualisms mark the repression.of organismic consciousness, which by its nature participates fully in Absolute Subjectivity, as it were, by virtue of the fact that its operations are spaceless and timeless. There is nothing in sensory awareness that corresponds to space or time. You cannot hear the past or future, nor smell the difference between inside and outside. Boundaries between inside and outside and past and future are symbolic conventions. III.The Third Dualism: The third dualism, which consists mainly of the bio-social filter, is a derivative of the first two dualisms, in the sense that culture molds and is molded by the tenet of self vs. other (the first dualism), and in the sense that culture is what man does with death (the second dualism). The third dualism acts, as we have said before, as a major filter of ~eality, and is the-final generator of the perception of body-consciousness."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Behavior Modification Throuqh Educational Systems Public Law 92-318, Section 432 expressly forbids the federal government from establishing or developing curriculum for schools. In addition, Public Law 96-88, Title I, Section 101, No.3 states: \"The primary responsibility for a child's education belongs to the parents.\" To presume to remediate children's beliefs and values without parents' knowledge or consent, using materials that bypass parental and community approval, can arguably be called a usurping of parental rights. In 1970 Congress placed an amendment in the General Education Provisions Act to specifically include, again, a \"Prohibition Against Federal Control of Education-\" This prohibits the government from exercising \"direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction administration or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system, or over the selection of library resources, textbooks, or other printed or published instructional materials by any educational institution or school system.\" The Education Amendments of 1976 extend provisions forbidding federal control of education programs in the Education division of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). This was back when the Office of Education was a part of HEW, before the U.S. Department of Education became a cabinet-level agency. Despite all this legislation, there is evidence that it is being actively circumvented in a blatant attempt to modify the thoughts and feelings of children according to parameters set by the Carnegie Foundation, a Rockefeller-based institution . Specifically, there is evidence that: 1.There has been storage on a national basis of cross- referenced personal information in non-secure data banks in such a way as to pose a threat to national and individual security and to violate the Fourth Amendment. 2.There has been unauthorized cross-use of official records. 3-There has been use of the social security number in a manner inconsistent with Section 7 of the Privacy Act of 1974. 4.There has been use of taxpayer's money to amass personal data accessible as psychological profiles, on children and their families, through the use of mandated school assessment tests, fraudulently passed off as academic achievement tests. 5.The U.S.Department of Education has been used as a pawn of the Carnegie Foundation, who seeks to redefine the social and 0108"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 economic framework of the country; government agencies have been placed in the position of conspiring to overthrow the U.S. Constitution. 6.A legalized private education system has been created and mislabeled as \"public schooling\". 7.Therapeutic programs have been created and placed in some schools that use unlicensed medical practitioners to conduct behavioral modification programs which attempt to change the feelings and attitudes of children, based on illegal psycho- logical assessment tests that use multiple choice questions with answers that only include responses indicating \"deviant\" behavior. For example, the question and answers would be of the format: If you saw a friend throw a rock through a window, would you - (a) Throw a rock at the same time (b) Wait a few minutes, then through the rock (c) encourage others to do the same. It leaves no socially acceptable answer, such as not throwing the rock at all- There have been cases where children have committed suicide because of some of the activities that occur in schools. * 8.Local educational institutions are routinely induced to accept federal money through subsidization in order to mandate federal programs that have ulterior motives and routinely use deception for private corporate gain. Admittedly, these are pretty strong charges, Where is the proof that this is happening? Research indicates that the Carnegie Foundation owns the Educational Testing Service (ETS), which makes a yearly profit in the millions. The ETS disseminates the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) taken by every high school student, the National Teachers Examination (NTE) taken by all teachers, and conducts Educational Quality Assessment (EQA) tests under the auspices of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Carnegie also established the Educational Commission of the States (ECS). It is a Rockefeller-funded institution. What does all this mean? There is a tendency in the U.S. for individuals or groups to perform actions \"in the public interest\" without the knowledge or consent of the public, The efforts being put forth under the \"educational\" system in the U.S. fall in this category. Children entering school today are the first recipients of birth-to-death computerized dossiers built around a social security number (SSN). Included in their files are probable political leanings, personal hangups, and family financial and personal background data - all couched in terms of \"demographic research\" and \"academic testing\". Schools have been set up as \"clinics\" where youthful opinions are analyzed for \"defects\", documented, and sent to computer banks which comprise the Elementary and Secondary Integrated Data System, which was brought on line in 1988. Whatever faction is control of American politics or any group with"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 enough money and influence can use this data to manipulate even the most \"democratic\" of political systems and use the technology to establish top-down control and coercive regulatory bodies, and in the end implement its own agenda. This is what is happening in the American educational system. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 permits state and local governments to use the Social Security number in administering their tax, drivers license, motor vehicle registration, and welfare payment programs, but no legal basis exists for using it to collect other data, much less to monitor the private domain of individuals. The CIA, of course, is exempt from the Act. * There is one book that documents much of this. It is called \"Educating for the New World Order\" by B.K. Eakman. It was published in 1991 by Halcyon House in Portland, Oregon, The ISBN number is 0-89420-278-2. It documents the incredible story of how one Pennsylvania woman stood the whole education establishment on its head and forced a cabinet-level govern- ment agency to obey the law. It discusses irregularities in the educational system dating back as far as 1965, The woman, Anita Hoge, won her case, but the system itself did not change. If you have children in public schools, you need to read this book! Cul turall Y Condi tioned Human \"Learninq\" A more basic issue underlies what is happening in the educational system, and that issue is the process of learning .itself. Learning appears to be defined in cultural institutions as a process of gathering information, rote memorization and repetition - but is that really learning, or just enculturation? Individuals are sent to school to \"learn\" things that are known. Is not true learning part of experience? Doesn't that mean experiencing something that is known? Experience is truly the heart of all knowledge, and it would appear that the context in which human \"learning\" takes place lacks the element of experience. To what extent does experience matter? Many human learning systems deal with philosophical approaches to theoretical issues, with knowledge amounting to \"re-experiencing\" what is already known. This approach results in a more or less intellectual framework which is sterile in nature. Can you imagine \"learning\" to drive by reading a book about driving? Don't you really learn by actually undergoing the experience of driving? The experience of driving results in the acquisition of wisdom relative to the experience. What is acquired through ones own individual experience, as wisdom, cannot be taught- From the wisdom is derived one's own truth relative to the experience. Thus, human systems of education cannot truly endow individuals with meaningful experience; it"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"MC)TRIX III is a factor which is subconsciously and innately perceived by todays school children, which is probably the reason why there is a waning interest in education and why school is a \"hollow experience\" - it leads to immense frustration and behavioral difficulties which are approached in society in a \"treat the symptoms and not the causes\" way, for if the causes were truly addressed, the whole system would have to be consciously changed. It will change, but only through disintegration. PSYCHO-SOCIAL ASPECTS OF POPULATION (Level Two) Research seems to indicate that a small percentage of humans have never been through an experience on Earth before their ~resent~existence. Some may have had physical life experience in other dimensions of existence as entities that are, by Earth standards, alien. Some individuals who are ex- periencing a physical existence on Earth have never been in a physical form of any kind before. The quaternary factors of Mass, Energy, Space and Time as applied to existence on Earth make for a unique experience. Human life has many attractions that are inherently compelling. For some people, it may be like attending a huge \"amusement park\" where previous \"rules\" that applied to a non-physical existence are temporarily suspended. Some appear to desire human existence simply out of curiosity, and want to find our what it means to be a part of human existence. Each point in human evolution provides a unique opportunity for growth. Some entities find that the implicit limitations imposed by \"physical incarceration\" as a human also concentrate certain types of energy only available in that state. Perhaps the greatest motivation for partici- pation in the human drama is to achieve the growth that comes with that participation. It is an intense learning process that forces the mixture of two aspects of modulated energy as male and female. Part of the adventure, no doubt, is to force the melding of these aspects within consciousness. The conditions of entering human life, from this perspective, are harsh. The entity, as an energy form, must agree that the concepts of space and time exist and will be experienced as limitations to overcome through growth in consciousness. Without this primary agreement, experience in third density is not possible. .. Part of this experience appears to be the screening\" of other experience (perceived in a linear fashion, because of neurological and psychological factors, as \"past\" experience) to assure a minimum of overt interference in developing aware- ness at the level of conscious perception. The consciousness of other experience, however, is retained within the essence of the lifeform experiencing human existence; it is present in the areas that are, for a while, \"unconscious\"."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 A lot of research has been done through the procedures of out-of-body travel that indicates that there are a great number of entities that wish to experience human existence on this planet - especially during this final period within this particular time-track, because of the aspects within this civilization (which is moving into fourth density) that promote resolution of polarities and increased levels of consciousness that may also resolve challenges relating to experience prior to physical birth. The time-track can be defined as the third density linear time span of the body, which is connected initially to the linear format at the geographical location in space-time where it came into existence. On it lie the sequential events relative to its specific existence during its life on this planet, The events in the time-track are recorded by the reactive mental gestalt (which we will discuss soon) every 1/25th second in the form of an \"energy picture\" containing all perceptions in the reactive mental gestalt. This \"energy picture\" can also be considered, from an expanded point of perception, as the physical universes impression on thought, specifically that aspect of thought which has a \"time-tag\" on it. These \"energy pictures\" can also exist independently, and can be seen as a collective gestalt of all physical perceptions, emotions and thought that is experienced. When the source exists in a time track, the collective perceptive gestalt is also tied to the time track occupied by the physical body. Apart from the reactive mental gestalt and the physical body, the occupying spiritual entity (as past of the Universal Intelligent Matrix) thinks without forming these energy pictures. It can act with- out experience and knows simply by being. Entities normally move freely in non-physical existence from one \"locus of focus\" to another by desire/thought/emotion that is given \"direction\" by will, focused through conscious- ness. The situation is radically different when memory is blocked by neurological factors (and other factors to be discussed later) and the constraints of being in a body are realized. Much of early human existence is consumed by frustration during the effort to obtain control over the body; this, along with the focus of consciousness being progressive- ly focussed through succeeding neurological structures in the brain as the physical organism develops, contributes to initial and often permanent restriction of the focus of consciousness on the body. Add the requirement for physical nourishment and the emotional habits that result from it, and you have an interesting situation- In addition, the perception is restricted through the physical senses. Thus, the process of focus of conscious awareness is turned to the dualities of pain and pleasure (through the reptilian area of the brain), flight and fight-etc. Attention is focused on the experienced events and then the experience is retained as a habitual form of memory aligned in a stimulus-response fashion. Emotion is an enhancer of the storage process for responses. A result of"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 this process is that individuals cannot experience an event, in \"time\", for itself; they get caught up in the event and react according to habitual response patterns - patterns which must be un-learned if one wishes to develop non-dual conscious perception of events as they really exist- All events are in fact neutral in content and meaning. The individual gives an event meaning and projects that meaning on the event. Learning also occurs during \"unconscious\" states as data and experience is accumulated on levels \"outside\" conscious awareness - levels that are fed during physical sleep, as well as those levels that retain a memory track of everything we experience. Culturally, individuals are conditioned to place little importance on events that are not remembered; it is not immediately recognized that it is these events which have a significant influence on activities and experience. When examined from an \"external\" point of view, automatic use of this learning process becomes visible. The practice of hypnosis illustrates this level of learning quite well, as it demonstrates the levels of consciousness that lie outside the usual focus and how they can interact with experience and the interpretation of experience. Learning systems in cultural settings typically feature situations where fluctuating attention is cast on low-order repetitive tasks, such as rote memorizing, which denigrates much of the learning that could potentially occur. These methods of \"learning\" (more like conditioning) are held in high esteem in human existence; virtually all of revolves around the knowledge, understanding, control and application of physical matter and energy systems generated therein. This dominant yet artificial and limited system of learning operates entirely through input from five physical senses; it has the effect of eliminating the last vestiges of identity and self-cognition from the individual. There is virtually nothing to guide human mentation in directions other than those di rectly related to time-space physical matter. All social institutions in human society, other than a small number of \"schools of ancient wisdom\", direct all thought processes reflectively back on human sociological \"history\", ignoring the Source essence from which all life arises. As the entity moves through life in human form, many attachments are formed. The most powerful of these attachments are emotional attachments which relate solely to expression only in time-space reality structures. This results in a compulsive need to reenter and recycle \"human experience\" to \"complete that which had been started\". It might be mentioned at this point that this disappears with increased levels of consciousness, but other manifestations of this compulsive need for a body are discussed in Level Three."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"MATRIX III There are two factors which contribute to such addictions to human time-space dramas. The first factor is a functional distortion of the survival drive into the elements of body protection and maintenance, as well as sexuality and repro- duction. Body protection and maintenance relates to the drive for the acquisition of food and water, followed by the drive to maintain a suitable body temperature, the need to keep the body safe from predation (all the way from being eaten to the assault from biological organisms). Yost of these \"needs\" are handled by lower neurological brain structures; conflict between needs of this nature results in activation of flight-or-fight circuitry in lower brain structures. All these factors tie in with the three culturally conditioned ego goals of security, sensation and power. Sexuality and reproduction is the most prevalent aspect of the survival drive imprint and is subject to more major distortions than any other. The greatest among these is the illusion that, as a creative act, it engenders the emotion of love. The results are attachments and commitments that are both irrational and restrictive, which not only distort current physical goals but continue beyond - illusory burdens of guilt, obligations and related memory patterns that persist as behavioral modifiers even after physical death. The original motivating drive to reproduce has become secondary to the sensory peak of the act itself. In addition, there is evidence that human genetics may have been altered to provide the propensity for behavioral patterns in this direction. The second factor which contributes to addictions to the space-time human drama is the diffusion of the primal energy of the creative force. Humans typically are embedded in emotional responses to internal and external stimuli. The . result is a chaotic mixture of unchecked and misdirected energy - a mixture that is culturally conditioned to express the \"good\" and repress the \"evil\". Decisions are made in blind anger and the results of the decisions are resented. Much of the problems in human emotional expression result from the lack of the ability to live in the moment and the element of projection. We laugh in joy and become depressed when the moment fades. We think we \"love\" and experience a \"broken heart\" when we discover otherwise. Humans emotions that are based in distortions of consciousness have a wide range; greed, guilt, worry, nostalgia, hope, loneliness, and the quest for happiness are included. By far the largest accumulated load is the emotional mass loosely held as the human ego. Originally a primal output from the survival imprint, it generates large numbers of emotional patterns which need constant reinforcement to maintain their existence; the drive for reinforcement consumes a tremendous amount of psychic energy. The ego exploits the concept that it is \"needed\" in order for the individual to \"exist\" and \"achieve\", that the emotion of \"confidence\" cannot exist with-"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 out ego support, and that \"happiness\" is a satisfied ego; the ego brings forth a torrent of emotionally irrational reasons to justify its existence - sidestepping the fact that emotion and irrationality are not synonymous. The heavy preponderance of emotions are directly related or attached to time-space physical matter earth events, things, and relationships. Because consciousness, of which you are a part, is not dependent on space-time for its existence, it is inevitable that many patterns are retained when entities are no longer in this dimension. Many of the patterns result in areas of resonance where entities of similar patterns congregate after physical death on a temporary basis. Ideally, an individual who was more conscious of his identity as part of the Universal Intelligent Matrix and also conscious of his habitual patterns would by-pass these lower areas that are resonant with less aware entities and move to areas in resonance which are, by nature, not restrictive or self- limiting. It is helpful, then, to address many of these issues while in this dimension in order to hasten progress once the dimensional barrier is passed upon physical death. One of the activities that will contribute to quicker passage through these lower vibrational levels is to recognize that survival-based sexual ties must be addressed. Emotional attachments to individuals are based in time-space realities, and do not apply functionally outside the constraints of these limitations. No \"male\" or \"female\" owes the other an obligation to have sex - a survival-based activity. What is experienced in the third density through sexual union is a function of the psychological drive toward wholeness, which is motivated by the dualistic fragmentation of the psychic whole by genetic and cultural influences. Once it is recognized for what it truly is, the patterns lose their repeatability and will be released as behavioral conditioners. Physical objects, as well .as individual people, occur within space-time formats - objects and people cannot be owned or possessed by anyone, except within a self-imposed mental structure. Even the physical body which is essentially a garment for the spiritual entity is \"borrowed\". There is much discussion about the concept of free will; within a space-time format, the physical nature of the human body is that is contains genetic programming in the form of behavioral and emotional patterns that have been locked into the DNA structure which is derived from every physical body that has ever contributed DNA to the physical body that is occupied. These emotional patterns place constraints on the activity and consciousness of the entity using the body while the consciousness of the entity is indistinguishable from body consciousness. What remains is culturally viewed as \"free will\"; the \"free will\" can be coerced. Body-consciousness is composed mostly of genetic programming; environmental and"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 cultural programming make up the balance. Body consciousness is almost entirely a chemically-based consciousness. It is the basic consciousness of what has been referred to as the genetic entity, the consciousness of the body itself. It is not until the focus on body-consciousness is broken that the occupying entity can progress in consciousness and increase perception of surrounding reality structures. PSYCHO-SOCIAL ASPECTS OF POPULATION (Level Three) On still a higher level of examination, let us return to the genetic programming which exists on a cellular level with- in the human being and examine some of the areas of interest that relate to this issue. In the human arena, the factors of mass, energy, space and time play an important part. Humans exist as composite entities, if you will, because you have a physical body (a bio-chemical electronic structure made of mass which exists in a time-track, occupying space) which has its own consciousness that is made up of a holographic gestalt of cellular consciousness ultimately based on DNA structures inherited from previous generations. The gestalt consciousness of the body can be called the genetic entity. It appears to have the highest density in the middle of the upper torso of the physical body, which can be seen as a container or vessel for the being which manipulates it. As mentioned before, any event which is experienced by a human being with an emotional component is recorded on quantum levels within the genetic structure on a cellular level - in truth, experience is recorded, along with emotional patterns associated with that experience, Mental pictures are also recorded. Many times, experiences may include periods of physical pain or periods of unconsciousness associated with physical injury or emotional trauma. These memory traces are very often held at specific points on the time-track of the physiological structure in which they occur - these points can re-impress the memory and associated emotional patterns along harmonic increments of the time-track in which other physical bodies exist that are genetic descendants of the body originally impressed. Within the total composite mental structure, there is an area which is based totally in stimulus-response, relating to several of the lower brain structures previously mentioned. It is this area where the composite genetic memory traces and associated emotional reactive patterns appear to be stored. It also appears to be the source of mental and emotional abbera- tion and \"psychosomatic\" problems. This reactive mental area acts below the level of waking consciousness within most human beings, and also retains event traces that occur during periods when the human is \"unconscious\". In actuality, it is an area in the mind, as it were, that is always conscious. It retains the memory of how many steps you took to the bathroom this morning. This reactive mind structure can exert influence on a sub-conscious basis on human actions, thoughts, and the"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 consciousness of the genetic entity which controls the body. At a deeper level, the genetic entity is itself a composite of all the cellular experience of all the individual bodies that have existed within the genetic line corresponding to the structural DNA patterns. The resulting manifestation of this composite, at any time during the genetic line, is in effect a singular consciousness that occupies and governs the operation of the physical body. When the consciousness of the genetic entity merges, by virtue of neurological structures, with that of the occupying entity through Fourier-based holographic interference patterns and wave structures, the psychological illusion (which is continuously supported by cultural means) is that the occupying entity is easily fooled into believing that it is, in fact, equivalent in identity with the genetic entity, thus relinquishing its own identity and assuming dn identity centered around body consciousness. The genetic entity maintains a memory trace of all the death experiences of the entire line of host consciousness that has utilized that specific structure. The composite mental gestalt of the genetic entity has also been called the somatic mind. The process known as hypnosis, in view of this knowledge, can now be viewed from a more accurate perspective. Hypnosis is usually seen as a process which is externally imposed on a human being that in fact reduces the conscious awareness of the occupying entity and magnifies the degree of consciousness of the genetic entity. It also has the unfortunate effect of keying in genetic memory traces and associated emotional and behavioral response patterns to externally applied stimuli. The process of \"self-hypnosis\", conversely, is one where the occupying entity reduces the influence of the conscious- ness of the genetic entity, and is a way to set up or program a compulsive or inhibitive circuit within it. Another mental structure that arises within the human is more analytical in nature and is more within conscious reach of the occupying spiritual entity. Normally referred to as the part of the mind which is conscious and aware, it is that mental structure which thinks, observes data, remembers, does problem resolution and combines perceptions (in time) to form conclusions based on the perceived reality of the situation; the gestalt of this mental structure results in accompanying visual imagery, which is presided over by the knowingness of the occupying spiritual entity. Notice that knowingness is being defined as a higher level of consciousness (which could be defined as \"awareness of awareness\" or the \"I\"), while the term \"awareness\" by itself applies to the analytical mental gestalt. The individual consciousness of .the occupying spiritual entity also has the capability of independent thought and experience of emotions, but it is immortal and does not 0117"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"MATRIX III require any structure at all to exist. It ultimately exists in and is derived from a Universal Intelligent Matrix which is beyond the spectrum of visible light (which humans, using dualistic anthropomorphic projection, refer to as \"God\"). Memory traces and accompanying emotional patterns that are inherent in the genetic entity, manifested through the reactive mental gestalt, can be restimulated into mani- festation through external influence. External influence could manifest itself through an environmental factors or even, on a higher albeit technical level, through implant devices or patterns overlaid within the physical body or within the fields surrounding the physical body as higher density implant patterns engrained in the electronic interference ridges between auric bands. Research indicates substantial evidence that this is a commonly applied method of manipulation. It is apparently uncommon for a genetic entity to host the same occupying spiritual component twice; this appears to reflect the overall tendency within the operative manifesta- tion of the Universal Intelligent Matrix for maximization of experiential differentiation, allowing genetic structures a plethora of controlling host entities. In other words, you as the spiritual occupying entity in the specific body and genetic line you are in, have never lived before this life- time. The genetic entity apparently enters the protoplasm line some two days to a week prior to conception. Since the genetic entity appears to answer, in present time, in a dual manner when queried through muscle testing and other methods, it is suspected that the genetic entity is in fact a \"double entity\" where one \"side\" enters via the protoplasm in the sperm and the other \"side\" through the protoplasm in the ovum. An interesting aspect of the combination of the genetic entity and a occupying spiritual entity is that there seems to be some evidence that both components of the composite human being carry facsimiles of the memory of each other, producing multiple facsimiles of \"past\" deaths for the same period of linear time. The existence of facsimiles in either the genetic entity or the occupying spiritual entity has a tendency to restimulate visuals which have their origin with former genetic entities or occupying spiritual entities. A human being could be defined as a composite which consists of a physical body, existing in space and on a time- track which contains a genetic entity and is occupied by a spiritual entity who has amnesia about its true identity. The genetic structure of the brain also limits perception to the confines of what perception the genetic line has had as experience. Thus, explorers sailing to primative islands during the time of Magellan found that the natives could not 01 18"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 even see their large sailboats lying there in the water, as no one within the genetic line of the people on the island had ever experienced it before. Gradually, the people began to be aware of them. Similarly, the genetic structure implied in some individuals permits them to see alien craft, while other people next to them can see nothing. OUTSIDE THE STRICTLY \"HUMAN\" EXPERIENCE (Level Four) Further complicating the human situation, there are extra-terrestrial genetic entities that might have been used by occupying spiritual entities that have their own memory structures which may have no reference point when compared to Earth-bound memory tracks; conversely, occupying spiritual entities may originate extra-terrestrially and occupy a Earth bound genetic line. Since these facsimiles, or perceptive memory gestalts, can exist independently, they can be accumulated by spiritual entities independently of physical body inter-relationships; they can be accumulated or discarded at will. However, the identity of a spiritual entity is not based on the memory of events but on an actual knowledge of identity. Entities are capable of removing chains of memory gestalts from other entities. Non-corporeal entities do not generally use these facsimiles as a basis for thought or action, but construct \"mock-ups\" of a situation, which is subsequently examined to extract potential information about how something works or what may be done about a particular situation - there is not a stimulus-response mode of activity. Multi-Density Electronic Mani~ulation fit this point, let's call an independent spiritual entity simply a Being. People generally seem to assume that because a Being is non-corporeal that there are no dualistic conflicts. There are conflicts through many density levels. There is consistent evidence coming out that electronics are used by Beings to manipulate other Beings; electronic energy flows can effect the overall density continuum in which a Being exists, making it visible or trapping it. Generally speaking, Beings appear to have several possible relationships relative to assumption of physical bodies: 1. In relation to a physical body, a Being exists in a relational way as a intelligent field structure of varying density that interpenetrates the body in varying degrees. a. A Being can exist just outside the physical body in a situation where it is monitoring it via direct with the neurological structure by quantum-based 01 19"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"MATRIX III fluctuating fields which have an effect on the motor controls on either side of the head. b. A Being can exist just outside the physical body within the auric bands, extending a significant part of itself within the consciousness of the body to the point where it loses its self-identity. In most cases, the position of the entity is behind and above the body. The typical human. c, A case can exist where the entity is barely or hardly ever in contact with the body, seeing the body from a remote location, while convinced that it \"is the body\" but cannot doing anything about it. This is typical of an initial out-of-body experience for a human. 2. A Being can operate exterior to a body without the need of a body, cleared of the compulsion to have a body, and can create or uncreate reactive or analytical mind gestalts at will- Various studies over the past thirty years appear to indicate that Beings can fall under the influence of higher level manipulative programming imposed by other Beings. The character of this higher level programming appears to fall into three broad categories: Devices, Embedded Entities, and Directive Electronic Ridge Implants. Devices The existence of various devices that are inserted into the physical body as implants is commonly known, and much of that information is generally discussed in Matrix 11, with special emphasis on the rationale behind the practice. The research that has occurred since Matrix I1 was written seems to point to the existence of various devices that are attached to what are colloquially known as the etheric, emotional, astral and mental \"bodies\" (or field structures) which inter- penetrate the body. It might be mentioned, in this context, that the human body (often referred to as a \"container\") is seen as an actual \"ID tag\" by some groups of manipulative entities, housing what amounts to a \"captive amnesiac consciousness of another entity\". What better way to conquer ones \"enemies\" than to electronically manipulate them, force them into physical bodies, induce amnesia, and program them with compulsions to remain in the cycle of physical incarnation? Sound far out? It is, and there is significant evidence to indicate that this practice is occurring, although one should be aware that no process is generally applicable to all Beings that utilize bodies, for one must make allowance 0120"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 for beings who voluntarily incarnate for their own purposes. Hubbard did much research in these areas during his early years - research that was able to follow an entities track back more than 500 million years. Hubbard. a former Naval officer, was aware of what the Navy was doing in the early days of MKULTRA. He refused to submit to government demands that he join the mind control group, and instead published material which , under the title \"Dianetics\", actually proved to be antidotes to the MKULTRA mind control methods. As a result, Hubbard was hounded the rest of his life. Research done by Hubbard-and othe~s appears to indicate that certain high level manipulative practices (originating with negatively polarized groups from Orion) has been in use for a very very long time. Research conducted in Hawaii during 1991 and 1992 by an individual who wished to remain unnamed has corroborated much of Hubbards work. Devices have been identified which exist on various vibratory levels and new methods to deactivate them using higher order electromagnetic fields have been devised and tested successful1y on abductees. Interaction with this researcher continues, and new developments will be reported in Leading Edge publications. Embedded Entities Forms of human energy field manipulation exist which involve interaction with the interference \"ridges\" which exist as boundary layers between areas of varying density surrounding the physical body. There is growing evidence that these ridges can be programmed in conjunction with the existing genetic matrix present both in cellular material and in derivations of the formative morphic field which support and give rise to cellular form and integrity. The ridges, in this format, function as \"pseudo-entities\"; the ridges, as nodal structures formed by the coincidence and interaction of two or more energy flows, create an enduring energy state which is programmable, self-functioning, and responsive to ambient thought flows arising from the human energy field in which they are located. There are indications that programmed ridge structures have been the source, at times, for \"voices\", theta wave fronts, and other energy progressions that are ultimately designed to dissuade the individual from a specific thought pattern. In other words, when an individual generates specific thought patterns that are not desired, the ridge implant responds by generating a compensatory field pattern designed to suppress that pattern; since the net effect in human consciousness so closely approximates average fluctuation in thought pattern, the existance of the ridge implant as the source of the variance in thought process remains undetected. Ridges are also a substructure around which facsimilies can be built. The actual source oP these implants is being researched. Effects can range from paralysis of areas of the physical body to various stimul us-response reactions re1 at i ng to specific"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 thought patterns of the individual. In other words, if an individual begins to have thought patterns which threaten programming structures, these implants kick in to divert mental activity to more basic areas - often areas which relate to physical survival. To some, all of this may sound like a science fiction plot or the ravings of someone with paranoid delusion ... but, indications of all this exist, and it is simply being related to you in the most neutral way possible that data regarding this does exist. Directive Electronic Ridge Implants One of the manipulative techniques which has been applied to Beings by other Beings during the last 500 million years is the heavy use of electronics or electrical current- Beings can be placed in an electronically generated field and rendered essentially \"inoperative\", the object being slavery, intro- duction of compulsive controls, and integration into incarnational cycles. The most recent application of these methods is seen in various races that have their origin in the Orion system - races which are negatively oriented, in that service-to-self is the objective. In a way, the concept of a facsimile is best described as a \"holographic insert\", where a virtual reality structure is forced on a Being, who cannot distinguish it as a synthetic structure. Some of these implanted facsimiles, as described, have devastating effects, and are created as inhibitory structures which limit the capability of humans and other incarnate beings which attempted to take control of an area occupied by beings in higher densities who are manipulative. According to research, one of the earliest implanted structures was an outright control mechanism invented by the Orion group to cut down on raids on their installations. It produces a non-combative, religiously insane community of individuals. It was installed using electronic equipment which emits a push-pull electronic wave in a series of stuttering \"baps\". It is violently restimulated in some humans when they hear pneumatic drills. In the original version, the invaders operated these machines on Beings while wearing hoods and goggles. Over the years, the use of this implanted facsimile decreased in favor of another one, which we will call the \"H\" facsimile, which apparently achieves the same result much quicker- The \"H\" implant is rigged with religious symbology creating intense dualism and conflict, and issues from a gun-like device which shoots a black and white waveform, implanting dualistic religious symbolic structures which are restimulated when thought patterns begin to run counter to the desired state. 0122"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Between-lives implants occur where the individual leaves the body upon physical death. Here, the individual \"reports in\", is given a strong memory-erasing implant, and is shot down into a body before it is born. The reporting area most often used is said to be Mars, although there are four areas on Earth protected by screens. The memory erasing procedure is quite interesting. The individual is seated before a wheel which contains images. As the wheel turns, the pictures appear to recede. The individual is moved from side to side, but a mirror arrangement shows him sitting still in front of the pictures. A force screen is projected at the individual through the pictures. The pictures dim out. The images are comprised of event facsimiles from the life the person just completed, and the effect is to give the person the impression that they have no past life. This type of incident can be restimulated with the passage of linear time to the point where, with physical aging, the individual starts to cycle through it automatically and goes into a \"second childhood\", which is to say that he anticipates the coming implant and conceives it to have been actually done. To have received this type of implant once is to get a restimulation on \"dying\" which will erase the memory of the life just completed. This implant is only effective if the individual identifies himself with body consciousness (as most humans do). Another type of implant trap that has appeared in research is called \"the boxer\". The purpose of this is to reinforce stimulus-response conditioning. The Being would be hit from every angle with a device and would be forced to kick back, which would cause him to he struck again. fit length he would be psychotic enough to return every motion he received. The result is the psychologists definition of a \"well-adjusted human being\" - one who is stimulated and responds without - thought. The purpose of all these implants is to force the Being into a state of forgetfulness, to rid the area of Beings who cannot be controlled, and to gain personnel for use as slave labor. You can see, from all the material in this chapter, how disadvantageous it is to be \"stuck\" in a physical body and unaware of your real identity, essentially a slave to chemical consciousness of the body, and \"stuck\" in repetitive incarna- tional cycles where you can be manipulated from many different levels. Because the tendency is, in human society, to totally identify with the consciousness of the body, humans can easily be manipulated further by manipulating the environment that the body exists in. This is evidently encouraged and guided by non-human factors and implemented by controlled humans who are in control of the world power structure. The first area of examination is the chemical manipulation of the human population - the next chapter in our story."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"MATRIX III Chapter 5 POPULATION MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE USE OF CHEMICAL AND METALLIC SUBSTANCES The Use of Fluoride Compounds Fluoride compounds have been in use for a long time, but not in the \"prevention of tooth decay\". The same fluorides that are used now \"in the name of health\" were for nearly 40 years used in insecticides and rodenticides because of its properties as a stomach poison. Fluorides are believed to exert their toxic action on pests by combining with and inhibiting many enzymes that contain elements such as iron, calcium and magnesium- For similar reasons, fluorides are toxic to plants, disrupting the delicate biochemical balance where photosynthesis takes place. There are no reasons to suspect that humans are immune from the effects of this potent poison. Even a quick perusal of the indexes of most reference manuals on industrial toxicology list a section on the hazards of handling fluoride compounds. Doses of 25 to.50mg are regarded as \"highly toxic\" and can cause severe vomiting, diarrhea and central nervous system manifestations. It is crucial to recognize from the outset that fluoride is a highly toxic substance. Appreciation of this simple point makes it easier to understand the natural reluctance on the part of some to accept without question the policy of compulsory ingestion of a poison to obtain what is alleged to be partial control of what would generally be regarded as a noncommunicable disease. The potent toxicity of fluoride and the narrow limits of human tolerance (between 1-5ppm) make the question of optimum concentration of paramount importance. Envi ronmen tal Pollution By Fluorides The fluoridation controversy becomes even more interesting when we realize that industrial fluorine wastes have since the early 1900's been one of the main pollutants of lakes, streams and aquifers, causing untold losses to farmers in regard to the poisoning of stock and crops. Fluorides such as hydrogen fluoride and silicon tetrafluoride are emitted by phosphate fertilizer manufacturing plants (phosphate rock can typically contain 3% fluoride). The industrial process of aluminum involves that electrolysis of alumina in a bath of molten cryolite"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"MATRIX III (sodium aluminum hexafluoride). It releases considerable quantities of fluorides into the environment. These fluorides are readily absorbed by vegetation and are known to cause substantial leaf injury. Even in concentrations as low as 0-lppb (parts per billion), fluorides significantly reduce both the growth and yield of crops. Livestock have also fallen victim to fluoride poisoning caused primarily by ingesting contaminated vegetation. It is reported that the Aluminum Corporation of America (ALCOA) is confronted by annual claims which amount to millions of dollars as compensation for the havoc wreaked by their fluorine wastes. Large quantities of fluorides are also produced by giant chemical firms, such as Hooker Chemical. Hooker Chemical, famous for being the main contributor to the pollution in Love Canal, became part of the Rockefeller network when Blanchette Hooker married John D. Rockefeller 111. Studies by the National Academy of Sciences show that US industries such as Hooker Chemical pump 100,000 tons of fluorides into the atmosphere each year and another 500,000 tons of fluorides into the nations water supply each year (this is in addition to the fluorides used to \"treat\" the water). The studies by the National Academy detail the effects of fluorides on the human system. Its most dangerous effect is that it slows down the vitally important DNA repair enzyme activity of the immune system. Fluorides have this effect even in concentrations as low as lppm, the standard dosage which the US Public Health set for drinking water. At this concentration, fluorides are shown to cause serious chromosome damage. The lppm level of fluoride has been shown in laboratory experiments to transform normal cells into cancer cells. American Academy of Science studies in 1963 showed that these \"low\" levels of fluorides resulted in a marked increase in melanotic tumors, from 12% to 100% in experimental animals. It also caused interference with the production of important neurotransmitters, and lowered their level in the brain. The same neurotransmitters have the vital function of protecting against seizures, thus opening the possibility of major increases in strokes and brain damage because of the fluorides in water. Lesser effects of fluorides which have been noted in laboratory tests are sudden mood changes, severe nausea, hallucinations, irregular breathing, night twitching, damage to fetuses, and various forms of cancer. In his work \"Fluoride: The Aging Factor\", Dr. John Yiamouyiannis finds that from 30,000 to 50,000 deaths a year are directly traceable to fluoridation; 10,000 to"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"MATRIX III 20,000 of those deaths are from fluoride induced cancers. It is interesting that this study has never been refuted. The death rate among elderly people from kidney and heart disease began to rise steadily in the first cities to begin fluoridating their water. One critic believes this was a deliberate decision, the \"final solution\" to the problem of Social Security payments. The steady poisoning of our older generation continues. The Fluoride Gambit It was in 1933 that the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) became particularly concerned about the poisoning effect of fluoride and its effect on teeth, and they determined that dental fluorosis (teeth mottled with yellow, brown or black stains) occurred among 25-30% of children when just over lppm of fluoride was present in drinking water. In 1939 the Mellon Institute employed a scientist, Dr. Gerald Cox, to find a viable market for the industrial fluorine wastes associated with the production of aluminum. At a meeting of water engineers in 1939, Cox first put forward his idea to add fluoride to the public water supplies. By 1940, Cox had become a member of the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council, and he prepared for them a series of submissions strongly promoting the idea of artificial water fluoridation as a means of reducing tooth decay. His recommendation was based on the following: In a widely circulated report in 1941, a popular magazine reported the case of Dr. George Heard, a dentist in Deaf Smith County, Texas, who claimed that he had no business because of the natural fluoride in the water. Later, when Dr. Heard found mottled teeth too brittle to fill and a rushing business after supermarkets moved in with processed foods, he tried in vain to set the record straight. He could find no publisher for his new information. His original article was entitled \"A Town Without a Toothachem- Since the use of fluoride actuklly increases the profits of the dental industry, it is no wonder that the American Dental Association promotes the use of fluoride and fluoride toothpastes. By 1942, the USPHS, largely under the direction of Dr. H. Trendley Dean, legislated that drinking water containing up to lppm of fluoride was acceptable. The USPHS was not at 'this point introducing the concept of water fluoridation - it was concerned mainly to define the maximum allowable limit beyond which fluoride"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 concentrations should be regarded as contaminating public water supplies. Dean's research investigations also indicated that although lppm fluoride concentration caused enamel fluorosis or mottling in up to 10% of the children, it also served to provide partial protection against dental decay. Dean was also well aware that fluoride concentrations of as little as 2ppm could constitute a public health concern, causing severe dental fluorosis. Coincidentally, the USPHS was at the time sponsored under the Department of the Treasury, the chief officer of which was Andrew Mellon, owner of ALCOA. What better way to solve the problem of the disposal of the toxic waste from ALCOA than getting paid to put it into drinking water? ALCOA ADVERTISMEM- 1 950 In 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan was selected as the site of the first major cumulative study of the effects of fluoridation on the public at large. Comparisons were to be made with the city of Muskegon which remained unfluoridated so that it could be used as a control. The experiment was supposed to occur over a ten-year period to determine any cumulative side-effects which might result from the fluoridation of municipal water. Before we go on, we must take a look at another player in this gambit by the name of Oscar Ewing - quite an interesting character. The head of the USPHS during the entire fluoridation campaign was Oscar Ewing. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Ewing was an airplane contractor during the First World War. He then joined the influential law firm of Sherman, Hughes and Dwight, a prestigious Wall Street"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"MATRIX III company. The \"Hughes\" in the firm was Charles Evans Hughes, who was a candidate for the Presidency of the United States. Hughes later became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The firm was then called Ewing and Hughes. At the end of World War 11, Ewing had himself appointed a Special Prosecutor for the Department of Justice. He was also appointed chairman of the Democratic National Committee. In 1946, President Truman appointed him head of the Federal Security Agency, which encompassed the U.S. Public Health Service, the Social Security Administration and the Office of Education. He was paid a $750,000 fee by Rockefeller interests to leave his law practice and assume this post. The purpose was to head the national fluoridation campaign. As head of the FSA, he was in charge of the vast government postwar spending programs in health, education and welfare. From this post, Ewing campaigned for greater government control over the citizens of the United States. Back to the Michigan test. Although the Michigan fluoridation test was supposed to be done over a ten-year period, Ewing intervened after only five years and declared the success of the st~dy in showing fluoridation to be safe. Ewing then encouraged its immediate adoption through the United States in June 1950. In 1951, Ewing was able to convince the Congress that fluoridation was a necessity, and a total of $2 million was immediately directed to promote the fluoridation program throughout the United States. Ewings propaganda expert for the fluoridation effort was Edward Bernays, who in 1951 was featured in a book entitled \"Public Relations: Edward Bernays and the American Scene\". Bernays, a Vienna . born nephew of Sigmund Freud, is documented in the book as having said, \"the direct way to reach the heard is through the leaders. For, if the group they dominate will respond ... all this must be planned ... indoctrination must be subtle. It should be worked into the everyday life of the people - 24 hours a day in hundreds of ways ... a redefinition of ethics is necessary ... the subject matter of the propaganda need not necessarily be true\", says Bernay. It was hardly accidental that Washington, D.C., where Oscar Ewing was king, was one of the first large American cities to fluoridate its water supply. At the same time, Congressmen and other politicians in Washington were privately alerted that they should be careful about ingesting the fluoridated water. Supplies of bottled water from mountain springs then appeared in every office on Capitol Hill; these have been maintained continuously ever since, at the taxpayers expense."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Use of Fluorides for Chemical Mind Control Ewing and his minions were undoubtedly aware of Soviet studies showing that fluorides were extremely important in introducing a docile, sheep-like obedience in the general population. The Soviet Union maintained its concentration camps since 1940 by administering increasing dosages of fluorides to the prison population in its vast empire, the largest network of concentration camps in the world. It is no small coincidence.that the totalitarian system in the United States enjoys just the same thought pattern, where all dissension and resistance is ended, and a slave population that has no voice in its own government. The Soviets were not the only ones who used fluorides for keeping populations docile. The Germans in World War I1 experimented with and successfully used fluorides as a means of population control. They discovered that after one year of consumption of fluoride-laced water, something occurred in the brain which made people more docile and more easily managed. Production of fluorine water additive products was controlled by 1.G.Farben during the Nazi regime. Use of Fluoride Com~ounds on Youna Children The earlier the fluorides are administered in a persons life, the quicker the cumulative effects will take hold. Now you can see why each year there are programs in schools to periodically dose children with fluorides. A popular product, called \"Swish\" is being used in schools in 1992. This product is formulated in Canada. The passivity and unwillingness to challenge any authority is the initial effect on the central nervous system. There are further effects upon the kidneys, a cumulative effect on the heart and other organs, as well as the widespread development of new and rapidly-spreading types of cancer that are associated with the use of fluorides. To hasten this objective, not only are American children being given fluoridated water; they are also told to brush their teeth three times a day with heavily fluoridated toothpaste which contains 7% sodium fluoride- Studies show that children habitually ingest about 10% of this solution during each brushing, giving them a daily dose of 30% of the 7% solution in the toothpaste. The water in the area where this book is being written is derived from two wells and is checked each year. The level of fluoride in the last test was 0-2 mg/liter, which translates to 0.2ppm (lmg/l = lppm).

There are local programs in the schools that encourage, and in some cases demand, that children use the product called \"Swish\" on a weekly basis. Combine that with fluoride toothpaste use and the effect is still being achieved. The dosing of school children with topical doses of fluoride, usually in a -2% concentration, occurs weekly in various parts of the country. A Freedom of Information Request to the local county Dept of Healh revealed that in 1992, the target in Thurston County Washington was 9,200 children.

Precaution - not for systemic use. Federal law prohibits distribution without a prescription.\" Fluorides Outside the Uni ted States Mandatory medication by fluoridation is not peculiar to the United States. Australians have for more than three decades been subjected to forced fluoridation of their drinking water. In 1953 the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia lent its support to the mandatory mass-medication of Australians. The introduction of fluoridation was linked with political and industrial interplay. A recent book published in Australia that deals with the problem is one written by Wendy Varney, entitled \"Fluoride in Australia - A Case to Answer.\" Today, Australia ranks as the most comprehensively fluoridated country in the world. More than 70% of the people are obligated to drink water to which fluorides have been added. Brisbane is apparently the only capital city which does not fluoridate. Australia, the future site (according to some sources) of the world government of the New World Order, continues to persist in its policy to fluoridate water supplies, despite the fact that 98% of the world's population has either discontinued fluoridation programs or never began them. Statistics how that less than 40% of the United States is currently fluoridated and England is only 10% fluoridated. Sweden, Scotland, Norway, Hungary, Holland, what used to be West Germany, Denmark, and Belgium are some of the countries that have discontinued fluoridation of their water supplies. 01 34"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 There are stories that have been told, stories which cannot be confirmed, that certain substances have been added to human water supplies in the past by various controlling species in the past. Perhaps the use of fluorides is just the latest episode in a long line of chemical manipulations of human consciousness. 4 ~onuressional Sta temen t About Fluorides Congressman A.L. Miller of Nebraska.is quoted in the Congressional Record on March 24, 1952, ~1833, as saying: \"I was misled by the Public Health Service ... I was misled and perhaps others have been misled by statements that the American Medical Association had given their unqualified approval to the fluoridation plan. All of the advocates of the use of fluorides in water said no conclusions had been reached, but studies were in' progress ... A11 of the facts have not been made available on this subject ... It is difficult for me to understand how high officials in the Public Health Service could change their mind over a 3 month period and completely reverse the field ... I sometimes wonder if the Aluminum Company of America, and its many subsidiary companies might not have a deep interest in getti,ng rid of the waste products from the manufacture of aluminum because those products contain a large amount of fluorine. In this connection it is interesting to know that Oscar Ewing, who now heads up the Federal Security hdministration, and the firm of attorneys he was with - Hubbard, Hill h Ewing - represents the Aluminum Company of America.\" Congressman Miller cited a witness before the committee, Dr. Robert S. Harris, who \"pointed out that there was plenty of evidence that 1 part per million of fluoride or a little more in the drinking water interfered with the enzyme systems which are involved in the growth of bones and in the function of nerve tissue.\" The Use of Chlorine Gas In the years immediately following World War I, the chemical cartels (dominated by 1.G.Farben) were faced with a huge supply of leftover chlorine, which had been manufactured at great expense to cause intensive suffering and death. They discovered that the only possible market was to sell it to American communities, who would then pour it into their water supplies. When the chlorine was added to the water supplies, it brought an unforeseen effect. It brought on a new epidemic of heart attacks. The chlorine in the water combined with 0135"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 the animal fats in the diet to form a chemical amalgam which formed a gummy substance in the arteries, creating a medical condition known as atherosclerosis, which brought on attacks of angina pectoris and coronary heart attacks. The addition of chlorine to public water supplies is mandated by state law in most areas, insuring the rapid rise of heart problems and high profits in medical areas. The Use of Nitrates Toward the end of World War 11, munitions manufacturers found themselves with huge inventories of nitrates. Because of the outbreak of peace, which is always regarded with horror by the major foundations, new markets had to be found. Nitrogen and nitrates were key ingredients for the manufacture of bombs and shells. A comparable peacetime market had to be developed. It was decided in 1945 that the only outlet was to put it into the food chain, as fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides The addition of these substances served to make farming even more capital intensive, forcing the farmers to borrow more money from the banks. This paved the way for the program of forcing individual farmers off the land, which would create the large agricultural monopolies. One chief effect of the use of chemical fertilizers was that it increased the abundance of crops, but also failed to replace the elements within the soil. This led to the profusion of inert, nutrition deficient foods that exists at this time. Additional chemically based minerals were added to the soil and the soil in most of the farming areas was rendered useless for growing crops- The soils ended up in a state deficient of most natural minerals and natural elements required by plant life. The use of chemical fertilizers caused the protein content of vegetables available to the public to drop steadily at the rate of 10% per year. The most dangerous result of this process was that the chemical fertilizers reduce the amount of potassium in the soil while at the same time increasing the amount of sodium. Inactive potassium in the system precipitates illness, especially cancer. The increased sodium may explain the dramatic increase in the incidence of high blood pressure throughout the United States, because the population is ingesting steadily increasing amounts of sodium from foods grown in chemically fertilized soil,. while simultaneously suffering from the effects of declining levels of potassium in the human system. Potassium is especially"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"MATRIX III necessary for the regulation of the heart beat; its lack makes the body even more prone to heart attacks. Many nutritionists believe that the use of chemical fertilizers cause up to 70% of all anemia in the United States because these fertilizers do not replace the iron in the soil. Ex~orta tion of Danaerous Pesticides and Druas Many pesticides that have been banned in the United States, such as DDT, are exported to third world countries in South America and Latin America, who in turn produce food that is imported back into the United States. Despite this problem, the Department of Agriculture continues to admit food that has been treated with DDT; the policies that permit exportation of dangerous/banned chemicals and drugs to other countries, permitting the chemical and drug companies to reap enormous profits from the misfortunes of human beings, still continues, unabated. Direct Addition of Chemicals To The Food SUPD~Y Most people in the United States are not aware that there are more than 5,000 chemical additives in the foods which they eat every day. The Federal Drug Administration describes these chemicals in this way: 1,700 + : Known to be harmless 1,800 + : Generally recognized as Safe 1,900 + : Never Tested For Harmful Results Most of these additives have been added since 1952. An effort was made in 1958 to control these chemical by Rep. James Delaney of New York, who conducted hearings between 1950 and 1952 that determined at the time that there were 704 chemical additives, 276 of which had never been tested for safety. It took six years for the Delaney Clause to become law. It states that if any food additive is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal, it is to be designated unsafe and cannot be used. Obviously, this clause is filled with loopholes, since it only mentions one disease condition. Also, it does not require that all food additives be tested. If they are tested, they are tested for toxicity, not for their propensity to cause the only disease mentioned in the clause. It was an incredible blunder that the public was oblivious to. Since the early 1940's food colorings were made from such poisonous substances as lead, chromium and arsenic, 01 37"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"MA TRIX 111 even though the 1938 Food and Drug Cosmetics Act certified only certain dyes for use in foods. Since then, three of them have been decertified. The word \"certified\" simply means that it is pure - it does not relate to its safety as a food additive or its effects on human beings. Some substances containing arsenic are still found in foodstuffs as pesticide residue and as a food additive for poultry and livestock. Other food colors tested by the FDA have showed some interesting results: FDLC Red No.32 produced growth retardation, anemia, and diarrhea. Tests of Orange No.1 gave similar results. More than half of the Florida Orange crop was run through these dyes to give them a beautiful orange color. Canned and frozen juice often contained larger amounts of these dyes, because packers by habit buy reject lots which are deemed unsuitable for marketing in supermarkets. Even though the FDLC No.32 produced these effects when people got ill in 1955, manufacturers were informed in 1953 that the substances were harmful and that they could legally use up their stocks of these colors. The additive was finally banned in February of 1956. In 1957, the FDA did tests on food colorings and reported that ten of the thirteen \"certified\" dyes then in use had produced cancers when injected under the skin of rats. It was estimated that humans would get twice as much dyes by mouth as the rats had injected under their skin. Some of the dyes commonly used in the United States at . this time are Orange No.1 and No.2 (both no longer retain their \"certified\" status), Yellow No.1, Yellow No.3, Yellow No.4, Green No.1, Green No.2, Green No.3, and Blue No.1. Yellow AB and Yellow OB, which are liver cancer hazards, have been widely used to color margarine and butter. They are made from a chemical with the long name of beta-napthylamine, which is curiously not poisonous in its effect, but one of the most carcinogenic substances. Orange No.2, which had been used heavily in the United States, was finally discontinued in 1956 when it was found to induce intestinal polyps and cancer in animals. Violet No.1 and Citris Red No.2 (used for coloring oranges) were found in a 1933 study to be carcinogenic.

Tartrazene is manufactured by producing a reaction of acetophene on diazomethane. The yellow result is used to color food and is poisonous. Coumarin, a key ingredient of imitation vanilla flavoring, had been in continuous use for 75 years before it was found to produce serious liver damage in laboratory animals. An artificial sweetening agent, dulcin, was used as a sugar substitute for 50 years before it was found to produce cancers in test animals. Cochineal, used to produce a bright red color in food, is made from the bodies of dried lice. It is also included in chemistry sets for children. Mineral Oi 1 , the famous Rockefel 1 er cancer cure of the 18509s, which is used in many salad dressings, was found to prevent the absorption by the body of vitamins and other nutritional needs. The increasing use of hydro- genated oils, and their kinkage to heart disease, offers an additional area for concern. According to government statistics, over a billion pounds of hydrogenated oils are used every year. Hydrogenated oils break down into toxins when heated. Many of these substances cause moderate to severe allergic reactions in human beings. It is estimated that almost 100 million Americans suffer from some form of chronic illnesses - many of these are increasingly found to be caused by exposure to or ingestion of some chemical substance in food. From 1940 until about 1977, the American intake of food colorings increased tenfold, while the actual consumption of fruits and vegetables declined. Studies have shown an inverse correlation between the intake of green or yellow vegetables and the mortality rate from cancer. The American Cancer Society ignores the fact that the increase in additive use parallels cancer increases. Again and again, the same pattern appears. Substances are proven to be harmful, yet they continue to be used in a deliberate manner. The story of cyclamates is an interesting one. In 1966, a University of Wisconsin study recommended that cyclamates be removed from all foodstuffs. It was found in this study that the ingestion of cyclamates affected the reaction of the eye to light, caused excess loss of potassium (here we go again) if a person was using thiazide drugs for high blood pressure (caused by high sodium levels in the food because of the use of chemical fertilizers), interfered with the action 0139"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"MATRIX III of diabetic drugs (despite the fact that cyclamates were advertised to be a solution to the sugar consumption problems of diabetics), and showed indications that it caused bladder cancer.

Soft drinks contain large amounts of phosphoric and citric acids (in an aluminum can), which increases the acidity level of the entire body; results often manifest as mouth canker sores and duodenal ulcers. Cola drinks increase heart action, cause irritability and resulting insomnia, and can cause paralysis of the heart. Beer contains gypsum, better known as Plaster of Paris. Hops in beer can cause a hypnotic effect and can cause delirium tremens . Caramel, also widely used, is prepared from ammonia; it is suspected in the manifestation of some mental disorders in children. Many of you will remember that several years ago the product called Phisohex (hexochlorophene) was heavily promoted as an antiseptic. It was found and used daily in every hospital in the United States. They then discovered that it caused death when rubbed on the skin of babies. Phisohex was also featured in feminine hygiene sprays, Dial soap, shampoos, toothpaste, and cosmetics. It is manufactured from the same chemical as DOW chemicals 2,4,5T and 2,4D, which are both weed killers, and is closely related to dioxin. It took ten years to get the products off the market. Bombardment of Food With Nuclear Radiation As with all the other instances of deliberate addition of harmful substances to the food and water, a surplus of materials (this time radioactive) prompted the \"brilliant\" idea of irradiation of food. The most commonly used substance for this process is Cobalt-60. The first commercial instance of food irradiation took place in 1957 in Germany, where it was used to sterilize spices. The results were so disturbing the government banned the pro- cedure the following year. Not a country to be outdone by anyone else, the Soviet Union decided to try it in 1959, followed by Canada in 1960, who was still doing it as of five years ago. Despite the negative results found with the process in Germany that resulted in the ban of 1958, the FDA in the 0140"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 United States that same year took up the use of food irradiation, defining it as an \"additive\", which brought it under their control. In 1963, the FDA gave their permission to irradiate canned bacon - permission which they withdrew in 1968, when the Rockefeller monopoly decided to back the irradiation of food on a national level. The nation's large food companies (and some chemical companies) formed The Coalition For Food Irradiation, and staged \"conferences\" at prominent universities, at which only the advocates for their plan would be heard. One of.the largest conferences was held in 1987 at Johns Hopkins, the second largest defense contractor. Johns Hopkins received $317 million in defense funds the year before. There are many records of tests indicating the dangers of irradiated foods. Consumption of irradiated rice has been linked with the development of pituitary, thyroid, heart and lung disturbances, and development of tumors. When children and animals were fed irradiated wheat (oddly, Canada would not irradiate their wheat but did decide to do it to their food), they developed increased abnormality of their chromosomes (called polyphoidy). The United States Department of State demonstrated their interest in the promotion of U.S. technology using Cesium 137 isotopes for food irradiation in 1988. Cesium 137 is produced from nuclear wastes (when will it end?) and, according the State Department, will minimize U.S. nuclear waste disposal. Gamma Irradiation Facilities are licensed by Abbott Laboratories to DOW Corning, General Electric, General Foods, IBM, IRT Corporation, Merck, RCA and Rockwell International. Environments 1 Chemica 1s In 1988, there was an article published in the Washington Post, albeit a CFR-controlled paper, that stated that at least 60,000 chemicals were in use in the environment. It also said that less than 2% had been tested for toxicity. It has been estimated that as much as 20% of the population in the United States is being seriously harmed by chemicals. The effect is probably strongest in the young. Millions of school children sit in classrooms for six hours a day breathing residues of the chemicals used to construct the schools, especially the schools constructed in between 1950 and 1968. Much of this chemical exp0sure.i~ from industrial wastes. Two reports surfaced in March 1992 about environmental chemical pollutants and health. The first report was about"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 the phenomena of autism, a brain disorder that affects many children. After a three-year study, many parents of autistic children were found to have lived in Leominster Massachusetts across from where the old Foster Grant sun- glass plant used to be. High levels of smoke containing vinyl chloride that would always envelope the neighborhood are thought to have wrought genetic changes that produced the autism in the children. More than 46 cases of children having autism were traced to the two streets across from the plant. The company has since gone bankrupt, and the area is currently under an environmental cleanup program. The second report concerns the town of Brownsville, Texas, which is on the U.S.- Mexico border. Parents in Brownsville, sometime ago, started having children that were born without brains, literally, in this Rio Grande Valley community. The occurrence of these anacephalic children in Brownsville is six times the national average. The source of the problem has been traced to American companies who are directly across the border (because of cheap labor and lax environmental laws) who dump xylene onto the ground, and the xylene has been leaching into the ground water in Matamoros and getting into the water table in Brownsville. The Centers for Disease Control was supposed to release a study about the problem in April of 1991. There is no data yet that indicates that the report was released. A similar report of children born without brains was televised in March 1992 about child- ren in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Use of Aluminum Meta 7 as a Physio7osica 7 Control Over Behavior and Consciousness As if the fluoride by-products of the Aluminum industry weren't bad enough, the use of aluminum in our society (check your toothpaste tube) directly causes the disease known as Alzheimer's disease. Over 3 million people in the United States are currently affected with this strange, incurable disease. Its victims bring the medical cartel over $50 billion each year. The presence of Aluminum, like fluorides, affects the neurotransmitters in the brain. The principal agent seems to be the accumulation of aluminum deposits on the principal nerves of the brain. About 70% of the costs of this illness is borne by the families of the afflicted, as most Medicare and private health insurance programs refuse to pay it. The origins of Alzheimer's disease have been traced to the large amounts of aluminum which most Americans began ingesting with their food since the 1920's and has also been connected with the increasing amount of microwave radiation exposure that American's have been experiencing."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Irradiated Food Do yoU how that Cobalt-60 is produced food irradiation has been from cobalt-59 in the Ca- approved by the FDA? nadian Candu nuclear E- And that the natiott's actors.

Some animals fed irradiated foods have lower birth weights and growth rates and have developed testicular tu- mors, kidney damage, increased rate of death in offspring, lowered immune response and abnormal blood cells. The British government's advisory committee has admit- ted there is insufficient scientific evidence on the safety of the effect of irradiation on pesticide residues, chemical addi- tives, contaminants and packaging materials. Irradiation may kill bacteria. but it will not remove the chemical toxins created by the bacteria before the food was irradiated. The technology is already being widely abused. Numer- ous cases have come to light where food companies have used irradiation to conceal contamination on unsalable foods (prawns, spices, mussels and chick- en) and put these back on the market. This practice makes obsolete the tests and controls that public health officials use to guarantee that food is safe, wholesome and fit to eat. Is Food Irradiation Safe for The Environment? There are several serious environ- mental hazards associated with food irradiation: Increased transport and handling of dangerous radioactive materials: Danger of exposure to wo~kers that could cause immediate death or could result in cancers or genetic- problems; Contamination of the the envi- ronment which has occurred due to accidents and safety violations at ir- radiation facilities; Increased generation of radioac- tive wastes, for which storage pro- blems are already severe; Cesium- 137 is only obtained by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, thereby encouraging this process which is principally used for extrac- tion of plutonium for nuclear wea- pons. Supermarkets have started selling radiation-exposed foods: spices, processed foods, and soon, meats and fruits and veget- ables. The supermarkets claim this irradiation preserves foods, but many scientists are saying irradiation makes foods unsafe, changes the molecular structure of food. destroys nutrients. and new studies show that ingesting radiation-exposed food causes genetic damage, which can lead to cancer and birth de- fects. Can you do anything about this? Yes, you can. Tell your supermarket manager you oppose having radiation-exposed foods in your store and you don't like shopping in a store that carries them.

This &vet is high for a normal pnon but levels between 60 and 80 micrograms per litre are common in kidney patients. says Altmann. In extreme cases, a palient who has been on dialysis and aluminium medicines regularly for several years may have several hundred micrograms of aluminium per litre In their blood.

After consuming food cooked in aluminum pots over a period from twenty to forty years, many Americans began to experience serious memory loss; their mental capacities then deteriorated rapidly. It was then found that concentrations of aluminum in certain areas of the brain had caused permanent deterioration of brain cells and nerve connections; the damage was not only incurable; it was also progressive and not responsive to any known treatment. Seven percent of all Americans over 65 have now been diagnosed as having this disease. Pharmaceut ica 1 Products Conta in ins A luminum This problem has not only been caused by the aluminum cookware, but by the daily ingestion of aluminum from many products in common household usage. Woman's douches now contain solutions of aluminum, which introduces it directly into the system; The most widely used painkillers such as buffered aspirin contain impressive quantities of aluminum. The largest single source of aluminum occurs with the daily ingestion of widely prescribed antacid products. For example, Mylanta I1 has 116mg of aluminum per dose. Estomil-M has a whopping 265mg per dose. Various other non-prescription drugs contain significant amounts of aluminum. Kaopectate Concentrate, manufactured by Upjohn has 290 mg per ml. The use of aluminum ammmonium sulfate as a buffer and neutralizing agent in cereals and baking powder is common. Aluminum Potassium Sulfate, known as aluminum flour, is widely used in baking powder. The use of Aluminum Potassium Sulfate has now reached 40 million pounds a year. Aluminum foil wrapping is everywhere. Aluminum cans containing acid-based soft drinks (Coke, Pepsi, etc) ensure that it will get into your system. Its effects are the equivalent to that of a slow virus, as the metal accumulates at vital pints in the system, particularly in the brain. Thus, the number of Alzheimer victims are vastly outnumbered by the victims to come in the future. The Neuro logica 7 Effects of A 7uminum Poisoning Some of the neurological effects of the accumulation of aluminum in the brain relate to a substance called choline, which brain cells used to form their surrounding"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 membranes. In an analysis of brain samples from people who died of Alzheimers, researchers at MIT, headed by Richard J. Wurtman, found that choline levels were 40% to 50% lower than in normal brain tissues. Levels of a related membrane building block, called ethanolamine, were similarly reduced. According to the MIT study (which was revealed in the March 2, 1992 issue of the Wall Street Journal, pB6), scientists found that the decay of brain cell membranes appeared to be unique with Alzheimers and did not appear in the brains of people who died from other degenerative diseases of the brain, including Parkinson's disease. The study also appears to link two hallmarks of Alzheimers disease - the selective, heavy damage it wreaks on brain areas involved in memory and the formation of clumps of protein called beta amyloid. Researchers have known since the mid-1970's that Alzheimers disease is correlated with a deficiency of acetylcholine, a sub- stance made from choline that transmits signals between neurons. Acetylcholine is especially important in brain areas involved with memory, notably the hippocampus. This may explain why memory is affected first in people with the disease. Because of these findings, the allopathic medical monopoly is (according to their habitual pattern of treating a \"disease\" in terms of its' symptoms) pro- posing giving Alzheimers patients massive levels of choline in an attempt to head off symptoms. If it were generally known that the cause for the disease is the progressive accumulation of aluminum, it could invite a tremendous wave of 1 itigation against the aluminum industry and also create many political problems for whatever current administration is in control. The major companies developing such choline-based drugs are Interneuron Pharmaceuticals in Lexington, Mass. and BrainChemTech Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. /9fidy,- u&u O.zlL4-t T& thry 6 no cure for Alrhc~rncrs &---- j hl\\KI\\(; LIFE A LITTLE MSIER- w ~hwe mun hr c~rc We - Liccmcdou~ondury24bow~ repond to th15 toll* prnhlm uith 5 - Rmtc qxfmcna - dm@ fa Scrufn grm~le wluuon an around the chk SaaddrrrraIhadaranha mdence olirnng pnfiesrnnd ThrrcbarncnylcmalrdailY r.cpruw uirh a cnmmllmml lo qudlh' Fm b.ncporation for ouMp Vight-mm.

Specific effects of societal drugs, such as the opiates, cocaine/crack, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, LSD, DMT, STP and designer drugs are designed to: 1.Limit the expansion of consciousness and awareness within select socio-economic groups. 2.Create an artificial situation where the presence of certain substances can provide the necessary \"social justification\" for legislation designed to suppress the social freedoms of specific groups within the overall population and the population in general. 3.Create a siphoning of monetary nature which reduces the economic position of specific groups, putting them in a more vulnerable position, while at the same contributing to the monetary coffers of both agencies within the government and organized crime. 4.Create physiological disorder which contributes to the general destruction of the health of the people and also provides monetary gain for the medical monopoly, which is closely tied in with defense and banking interests. 5.Create a situation where, by virtue of all the drugs being pumped into the population, the nervous systems of the people are being modified and partially shut down in order to permit control of the population from an outside source, ie., with electronics and through electronic surveillance.

It"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"MA TRIX 111 began with a small group of international financiers, headquartered in London, who officiated in the setting up of an \"American\" intelligence service, which was initially known as the Office of Strategic Services during World War 11. This organization was set up under the close super- vision of the British Secret Intelligence Service and was later disbanded by President Truman, who was highly suspicious of its operations. The OSS then went underground at the State Department as a \"research groupn working on \"behavioral theory\". It was led by Evron Kirkpatrick, whose wife, Jeane Kirk- patrick, is a director of the Rockefeller financed League for Industrial Democracy. The Kirkpatrick group resurfaced as \"the Central Intelligence Agency\", headed by Allen Dulles, a partner in the Schroder Bank, the bank that had handled Adolph Hitler's personal bank account. Dulles' brother, John Foster Dulles, was then Secretary of State under Eisenhower. Whatever interest the CIA may have had in \"intelligence\", it soon became clear that its primary interest was in the realization of the enormous profits to be made in the international drug trade - the same trade that had established British fortunes in the early 19th century. The excuse advanced to justify going into this business was that Congress refused to advance enough money to the CIA to finance covert operations. Bo Gritz, over the last several years, has revealed his knowledge of CIA drug operations uncovered during his stint in Southeast Asia and his interaction with one of the areas largest drug producers, Khun Sa. Khun Sa told Gritz that the blame for the world drug operations was on some of the CIA'S leading operatives, including Theodore Shackley, who served as chief of station for the CIA in Laos from 1965 to 1975. Khun Sa stated that Shackley had worked closely with Mao Se Hung, who was then the leading drug smuggler in Southeast Asia. Another colleague to Shackley was Santos Trafficante, a leading figure in the Mafia. Trafficante became involved in the Pacific area of the drug traffic, becoming a go-between for the N~gan Hand operation, the drug bank in Australia and in the Golden Triangle. Another person identified by Khun Sa and others as active in the drug trade was Richard Armitage, whose drug operations began during the Vietnam War. He moved to the U.S. Embasssy in Bangkok after the war. From 1975 to 1979, according to witnesses, he used his embassy position to carry on drug operations. He then left that post,"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"MA TRIX 111 establishing the Far East Trading Corporation in Bangkok. Armitage was later appointed by Reagan as Assistant Secretary of Defense in charge if International Security Affairs, reporting directly to the Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger. Business tycoon H. Ross Perot learned of Armitage's history and went to the White House, demanding that Armitage be fired. He talked to George Bush, who gave him the brushoff by sending him to FBI Director William Webster (shortly thereafter, Webster was quietly appointed head of the CIA).. Webster refused to act on Perot's complaints, which-opened the door for his appointment to the CIA post. Weinberger resigned. He was succeeded by Frank Carlucci, who was then serving as National Security Advisor, and who was well versed in the entire operation. Carlucci ordered Perot, whose fortune had been built on government contracts, to drop his crusade against Armitage. General Richard Secord was also involved. Secord surfaced as a figure during the Iran Contra affair, and had boasted of flying plane loads of gold to Southeast Asia to pay off drug smugglers. In March 1992 Perot indicated his desire to run for president. Drug involvement in the Iran Contra affair should be a surprise for no one. It threatened to blow the lid off the Iran, Israeli, Swiss, and Rockefeller involvement in the importation of drugs into the United States, as well as the involvement of the military. The danger was put aside by causing the focus to be on Oliver North and Admiral Poindexter, who were portrayed in the media as \"crusaders against Communism\". Tobacco: A Commentary Tobacco: Primitive tribes have seemingly been smoking tobacco for hundreds, if not thousands of years with no apparent disagreeable effect that is mentioned anywhere in historical literature. Dr.Richard Passey, a researcher at London's Chester Beattie Research Institute, conducted twenty years of research on the tobacco problem. He found no significant link between lung cancer and traditiona77y air-dried tobacco that contains no additives. However, it becomes quickly apparent tobacco today contains a great many additives. The tobacco industries are dominated by firms controlled by the Rothschild banking empire; the primary additive in tobacco is sugar. England uses 17% sugar added as a drying agent - the United States uses 10% sugar. England also has the highest lung cancer rate in the world from smoking. Dr. Passey concluded that the addition of sugar to tobacco creates a carcinogenic substance within the nicotine tar; he found no trace of this carcinogenic substance in air-dried tobacco; lung cancer rates in the Soviet Union, China and Taiwan, who"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 U.S. tobacco export is: free trade in death By ErkMaroth 3-a/- 92 roducing cancer-causing polycyclic aro- Latic hydrocarbons when burned: cate- Loopholes abound in our govern- chol, a co-carclnO'en and a byproduct merit's policies.

Additional research has been conducted on tobacco and cigarette additives since the Passey study which indicates that not only is the actual list of additives not available to the public, but that it is against the law to reveal them to the public. In 1984, legislation was passed which required cigarette manufacturers to \"list health risks associated with smoking cigarettes containing any substances commonly added to commercially manufactured cigarettes.\" This only requires them to list health risks, not the ingredients. The Surgeon General's report said that data about additives was impossible to obtain, \"because cigarette companies are not required by law to reveal what additives they use in each and every brand of cigarettes they manufacture. Congress reluctantly passed a law in late 1984 which reconnnendedthat cigarette manufacturers provide the-Dept of Health and Human Services (HHS) each year with a list of additives used in cigarette manufacturing. The tobacco industry was successful in subverting that law to the point where they were allowed to get away with providing a \"very general list of additives\". These annual lists have been described by anti-smoking groups as \"page after page of meaningless names\". Later the tobacco industry got a provision entered into law which said the lists of additives were not to be published or made available to the public or research scientists, making it a crime to provide the information in the lists to anyone. Each year the tobacco industry gives H.H.S. its secret list and they lock it away from prying eyes. Early in 1991, Dr. Ronald Davis resigned from the government Office on Smoking and Health, and is on record as stating: \"I think the consumers have a right to know what is in tobacco products, but I'm not allowed under law to release this information to the public.\" There is a specific kind of chemical reaction that occurs when substances are combined and then burned, called a synergistic reaction. Due to this kind of heat related reaction, these substances combine to form cancer- causing compounds. What are these substances? There has been some information about tobacco and cigarette composition which has filtered out of private research companies. There are many substances that go into the tobacco mixture that give it the characteristics that it has. Additives give tobacco an artificial \"flavor\", keep it soft and give it a special aroma.

A documented case of what might be in the paper came out when a doctor was invited several years ago to a facility that made cigarette paper. Before being shown around the faci 1 ity he had to don a coverall made of a paper-1 ike substance, which covered him completely. He was shown various stages of manufacture which included a sealed room that his guide referred to as the \"impregnation room\". The doctor was allowed to keep the coveralls as a souvenir. Noting that the guide had muted responses to some of his questions, he had fine dust on the coveralls analyzed. The lab results came back showing that the substance which had collected on his coveralls at the cigarette paper plant was OPIUM. Since a small amount of this substance can be highly addictive, it explains why hand rolled tobacco using other types of paper does not satisfy the craving that regular cigarettes do. Those cigarettes billed as \"light\" contain less tar and nicotine producing additives but more opium to compensate, since the combined addiction relates to both the opium and the nicotine, which is itself highly . addictive and poisonous. Because of the opium additive, the addiction to cigarettes would stimulate the 1st area of brain structure; people would be thrown into a continuous round of stress that is related to primitive areas of the brain in between cigarettes.

These are covered to some degree in Matrix 11. After Allen Dulles returned to the United States to become director of the newly created CIA, he ordered lOkg of LSD from Sandoz, the stated purpose being \"for use in drug experiments with animals and human beings.\" This lot of LSD was equivalent to 100 million doses. The National Institute of Health funded a grant to the Uris Foundation in New York which commissioned Tim Leary to do experimentation with psychedelic drugs, which he did from 1953 to 1956, when it was moved to the U.S. Public Health Service until 1958. From 1956 to 1963 there was an over- lapping program at the Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) office. Some 1,500 military personnel were given LSD in tests run by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, who also tested 82, a powerful chemical hallucinogen, from 1959 to 1975 at Edgewood Arsenal. One of the results of the CIA drug program was the death of John Kennedy, who had demanded that the agency get out of the drug business. One character in the CIA backed mind control operation has not been discussed at any great length. Ewen Cameron, who was born in Scotland, moved to the US and became a resident of Lake Placid, New York. In 1943, Dr. Cameron received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to set up a new psychiatric Institute, the Allen Memorial Institute, which became the destination for more than $10 million in CIA funds as part of the MK Ultra project. This money was transferred to Cameron in 1953, because of his commitment to mind-altering experiments. He invented some of the most terrifying techniques ever known, thanks to backing from the CIA and Rockefeller interests. One of the techniques, known as depatterning, began with drugs and was then supplemented with electro- convulsive therapy, which has been described by victims as \"the electrocution process, except that it was shut off before it became fatal\". The use of ECT can still be seen at institutions in the United States. Barbaric? Of course. Cameron also perfected techniques of sensory isolation and a process which he called \"psychic driving\", in which a person would be forced to 1 isten to recordings many thousands of times. Because of his work and the backing from the CIA, Cameron was appointed as chairman of the Canadian Psychiatric Association, chairman of the American Psychiatric Association and a founding chairman of the World Psychiatric Foundation.

An issue of the Washington Post in January 1988 described a lawsuit by nine Canadians who were subjected to LSD work in the 1970's. The case still has not been decided and is still in litigation as of March 1992. For at least the last fifteen years, the use of drugs for mind control operations has been in the operational phase, both for individuals who work in highly classified positions (such as the,mind-altering treatments given to Robert Lazar) and substances distributed within the general population. When we take into account all the information compiled about the government and drugs, we can say without any reservation that the government of the United States, with an ex-CIA director as President, will continue to be in- volved in criminal activities until another more reason- able approach is voted in by \"conscious\" human beings. Socio logica 1 Trends It is interesting that the question never arises in social consciousness: Why is the president of the United States (former head of the Central Intelligence Agency) addressing the problem of drugs to the level of school children rather than to the huge conglomerate of drug smugglers and importers? The real problem is coming from the Office of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Oval Office of the Presidency. They apparently have it so finely tuned that many of the so-called \"street people\" are already under electronic control and can be used as \"covert\" operatives (the CIA term \"useful idiots\" best describes this situation) in that their behavior can be influenced as a disruptive social factor to induce the sway of public opinion on sociological issues that benefit the administration. What we are beginning to experience is a country filled with controlled, essentially \"brain-dead\" people who are at the whim of a government who is ultimately able to pulse thoughts into the minds of the populace and have them act on these thoughts, since the state of conscious- ness for the majority of people does not permit adequate discrimination that would permit recognition of exteriorly implanted thoughts and concepts.

Nitrates also act as fertilixn for aquatic plants.

Many people are worried about the pollu- tion of the sea near coastlines. Proliferations of algae. or algal blooms as they are called. can cause great damage. As a result of nutrients from fertilisen washed into the North Sea in the summer of 1988, algal blooms almost wrecked salmon and trout farms off the coast of Noway. Local fish farmen lost an estimated US S2OO million. Toxic blooms were present in the North Sea once again this summer and also off the coasts of Denmark and Yugoslavia, and in the Irish Sea. Although scientists have clearly shown that nitrates. and not phospl~ates. are responsible for algal blooms and plant growth in rhr sm. European countries con- tinue to dump into the North Sea more than l .S million tonnes of nitrogen every year- two-thirds of it from rivers carrying agri- cultural runoff.

Most of the principles which form this concept have their origin with the work of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch, work that was performed in the last half of the 19th century. It also appears that the general failure of medicine to deal effectively with the concept of \"disease\" has its origin in faulty research. P7eomorphic Life Forms One concept that \"modern\" biological science observes but refuses to valify within their own minds is the concept of pleomorphism, which refers the ability of one species of organism to change into another species or type of organism. One individual who pointed this out was Gaston Naessens, a 68 year old Canadian microbiologist, who discovered that there were smaller living orgamisms than bacteria (not including viruses) that lived in human blood. He termed these living organisms \"somatids\". Sbmatids are pleomorphic organisms; they can change into other life forms, such as bacteria and yeasts, during specific cycles of development. This is an important factor, because \"modern\" medical science is only geared toward addressing \"exterior monomorphism\" (stable exterior lifeforms) and not the existence of pleomorphic organisms that exist in human blood. Naessens made this discovery around 1949, when he invented a highly advanced dark-field microscope. Naessens was not the only one to discover the existence of other type of lifeforms in human blood. Pasteurs rival, Antoine Bechamp, termed the organisms he discovered \"micro- zymas\". Pasteur, on his deathbed, seemed to support this view, for he declared that \"the microbe is nothing; the terrain is everything\", which explains why robust immune systems don't get plagues of exterior diseases. One of Bechamps observations was that microzymas in dead bacteria were living, and that the organisms seemed to be of a novel nature. Bechamp also was the original discoverer of enzymes, but was not credited with it, since his other work would have eliminated the deceit and profit associated with \"modern\" medical"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":",~au~oue laye 0~14~ wt?pc,oo auo s,al."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 practice; it was better to let his name fade into non-existence. Between World War I and World War 11, a German zoologist named Geunther Enderlein discovered what he called a \"totally new observation of the microbiotic world\" and noted that it featured the phenomena of pleomorphism. In 1925 pub1 ished The Life Cyc7e of the Bacteria and outlined what he had discovered. Since he was the curator of the museum in Berlin, his work should have been received around the world. It has also been ignored. Enderlein delineated many different pleomorphic develop- ment phases of bacteria and showed that illness and healing processes are bound to exact cyclical and morpho- logical laws. Enderlein unequivocally asserted that while different organisms normally live within the body in a mutually beneficial symbiosis, with severe deteriorization of the environment of the body (a main result of the factors thrust on humans discussed in previous chapters) they develop into disease-producing forms and create what is essentially a fault in the life process. Wilhelm Reich observed the existence of \"bions\" in living organisms that were apparently the basis of life. He was imprisoned by the U.S. government and died in prison in 1964. Most of his books were gathered up by the government and burned. Now, the work of Naessens opens new vistas on the work of Reich, Bechamp, and Enderlein. Canadian officials plan on putting Naessens, 68, through a third trial for \"practicing medicine without a license\". Will Naessens books also burn? When todays \"researchers\" discover microbes that are associated with cancer states, for example, the microbes are each given their own name, creating a kind of \"Tower of Babel\"; instead of looking upon the appearance of the alien forms as an indicator of an approaching disease state, they are held to be the cause of the disease. How many time have we been told another \"cancer virus\" has been discovered, only to have the discovery fade into obl ivion? The research of Naessens has been going on for about 50 years. His \"somatid\" discovery has, like the discover- ies of others in the same area, the potential to rock the medical establishment. A tiny drop of blood can reveal the condition of both the blood and the organism it came from by the numbers and nature of somatids, which are always present in the fluids of living creatures in the plant and animal world. A newborn child's blood is teaming with active somatids, which in a healthy bloodstream go through a three-phase life cycle. The somatids, according to"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Naessens, are the precursors to DNA and are the link between energy and matter; Reich held a similar view about bions when he called them the link between living and non-living matter. Whenever healthy blood undergoes deteriorization, whether through injury, toxins, pollution, drugs or other external impositions, the normal three-phase life cycle of the somatid becomes a 16-phase cycle replete with bacterial and yeast life forms that can actually parasitize the body, which then becomes a \"host\". They do not in fact cause.disease, but mark and identify disease states and promote disease conditions, There is a videotape and a book that is available about the somatids. Both are available from Carotec, PO Box 75337, St.Pau1, Minnesota 55175. The book is $14.95, postpaid, and the 55-minute videotape is $55. The Immunization Gambit The term \"immunization\" was derived from the belief that the injection of a foreign body of infection into the human system (which already possesses a natural immune system) will confer life-long immunity from a specific disease. The word immunization is synonymous with the word in?oCIijiatjbn.. *Despite this belief, there has always - existed the observation that immunizations cause disease, and it is considered heresy in the medical community to make mention of this fact. Immunizations also are responsible, according to some medical experts, for many health problems. Dr. Herbert Snow, senior surgeon at the Cancer Hospital of London, once stated that immunization or inoculation causes permanent disease to the heart. This information, according to author Eustace Mullins, also exists in the Library of Congress, buried. Judic ia 7 Awards For Vaccine-Caused In-iurv A recent court case in Kansas is only one example of how \"immunizations\" can be deadly. An eight year old girl was awarded over $15 million in damages after receiving a DPT (diptheria-pertussis-tetanus) immunization which gave her permanent brain damage at the age of three years old. The producer of the DPT vaccine, Wyeth Laboratories, attempted to deny that the damage was caused solely by the DPT vaccine, but the lawyers proved there case to the satisfaction of judge and jury (f990 Graham vs Wyeth Labs). 0165"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 The magazine Science is well known for its exposition of scientific discoveries in the areas of medicine. In the March 4, 1977 issue, researchers Jonas and Darrell Salk warned that, \"Live virus vaccines against influenza or poliomyelitis may in each instance produce the disease it intended to prevent ... the live virus against measles and mumps may produce such side effects as encephalitic (brain damage ) . \" In the magazine Health Freedom News, July/August 1986, an article noted that \"Vaccine is linked to brain damage. 150 lawsuits are pending against DPT vaccine manufacturers seeking $1.5 billion in damages.\" At the annual AMA Convention in 1955, the Surgeon General of the United States, Leonard Scheele, said that \"no batch of vaccine can be proven safe before it is given to children.\" James R. Shannon of the National Institute of Health declared that \"the only safe vaccine is a vaccine that is never used. \" In the United States and many other countries, there are compulsory immunization programs for children. Because of the financial prospects, physicians are asking that children be vaccinated earlier in their lives. It is no small coincidence that the agencies responsible for the promotion of immunizations, such as the CDC, FDA, AMA and the WHO are also involved with the large drug firms who. . make it their business to treat the diseases the vaccines cause. It is also these same agencies that have drafted the procedures which forced the states to enact compulsory immunization legislation. Interestingly enough, in the early 1900's, physicians were more vocal on the dangers of the immunization process. In 1909, Massachusetts enacted Bill No.8, which was an \"Act To Prohibit Compulsory Vaccine\"; a legislative triumph, to be sure. In order to prevent such logical and rational thought from gaining a foothold, Rockefeller interests perfected the means for controlling every state legislature in the United States by setting up the Council for State Governments in Chicago. No state legislature has ever failed to follow its dictates. The Sma 7 7pox Gambit In the 1800's Edward Jenner \"discovered\" that cowpox vaccine would supposedly inoculate persons against the 18th century scourge of smallpox. In fact, by the time Jenner made this \"discovery\", smallpox was already on the wane. After the use of cowpox vaccine became widespread in England, a smallpox epidemic broke out which killed over 22,000 people. The epidemics became worse each year that"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 the vaccine was used. In 1872, over 44,000 people were killed by it. England finally banned the vaccine in 1948. Japan initiated compulsory vaccine for smallpox in 1872. Within twenty years, there were over 165,000 cases of smallpox; these resulted in the death of almost 30,000 people. Germany, during the Nazi regime, instituted compulsory immunization for diptheria. In 1939 the diptheria rate went up to 150,000 cases. Norway, which never had compulsory immunization, had only 50 cases for the same period. During the ~ranco-Prussian War, every German soldier was vaccinated against smallpox. The result was that 53,288 otherwise healthy men developed smallpox. Po 7 io Vacc ine The most unknown victim of polio was my own father; the most famous polio victim was Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1931, during the annual polio epidemic, Roosevelt officially endorsed an \"immune serum' which was a pre- cursor of the polio vaccines of the 1950's. The serum was sponsored by Dr. Lindsly Williams, director of the New York Academy of Medicine, which was built by the Rocke- feller and Carnegie Foundations. After Williams announced during the FDR campaign that Roosevelt was fit to be President, Williams was appointed the Secretary of Health. The \"immune serum\" against polio was known to be dangerous and worthless when Roosevelt endorsed it. The National Health Institute of the U.S. Public Health Service had experimented with monkeys for three years using this identical serum. The serum was used and several children died from it. The New York State Commissioner of Health, who owed his appointment to Roosevelt, refused to hold hearings to validate the. serum, while Roosevelt continued to reap the rewards of \"charity\" from his Warm Springs Foundation and his annual birthday balls celebrating the polio epidemic. In 1948 it was discovered that the intake of sugar had a direct relation to the virulence of the polio outbreaks. Cases fell tremendously, after this was briefly publi- cized. By 1950, people forgot this fact, and the polio to11 rose to the 1948 level. Polio has increased 700% in states which have compulsory immunization. There were a considerable number of lawsuits filed against drug companies in connection with the various . types of polio vaccine.

In two cases involving Parke-Davis Labs and their polio product Quadrigen, the product was found to be defective. In 1962, Parke-Davis halted production. Dr. William Kock declared that \"the injection of any serum, vaccine, or even penicillin has shown a very marked increase in the incidence of polio, at least by 400%.\" Polio vaccine has now been accepted as a fact of life by the American public, which derives considerable comfort from the gradual disappearance of the annual scare cam- paign at the beginning of each summer. On January 26, 1988, the Washington Post featured a story that reported on a national press conference held in Washington where it was reported that all cases of polio since 1979 had been caused by the polio vaccine. It said, \"In fact, all the cases in America come from the vaccine. The \"naturally occurring\" (or \"wild type\") polio virus has not been shown to cause a single case of polio in the United States since 1979.\" Despite this, the Post reported that \"no radical change is expected. The status quo is very appealing, according to conference chairman Dr. Fred Robbins. Cutter Laboratories, a subsidiary of Bayer A.G. in Germany (a spinoff from I.G.Farben), was a California firm which was set up to produce polio vaccine in order to protect the Rockefeller controlled drug firms from lawsuits. Most of the faulty polio vaccine was said to be produced by Cutter. Inf 7 uenza Vacc ine It was in 1918 during the First World War that immunization for influenza was compulsory for all service- men. That was the same year of the \"great flu epidemic\". Military hospitals in 1918 were filled with more men who were casualties of the flu vaccine than from actions that were attributed to war. The epidemic was termed \"the Spanish Influenza\", a term intended to conceal its origin. The influenza epidemic of 1918 claimed over 20 million lives; those who survived it were those who had refused the vaccine. It began at a military base in Kansas. According to the 1991 Edition of the Physicians Desk Reference, the annual flu vaccine, Fluogen, is made by the firm of Parke-Davis Labs. The formulation is derived from the recommendation of the Office of Biologics, Federal Drug Administration. The basis for each years formulation by the FDA remains unknown.

The Great Swine Flu Massacre of 1976 On April 15, 1976, Congress passed Public Law 94-266, which provided $135 million to pay for the national swine flu inoculation campaign. Under this campaign, which was heavily promoted by President Gerald Ford, the Department of Health Education and Welfare distributed the vaccine to state and local health agencies on a national basis so that individuals could get vaccinated at no charge. On the surface, this might appear to be the height of altruism, but in actuality it was one of the largest and most scandalous public deceptions ever thrust on the American public. Research indicates that the swine flu vaccine was originally developed for use in the swine breeding industry. Swine breeders were wary of vaccines because they had noticed a parallel developing with human vaccines where individuals would acquire the disease the vaccine was developed to prevent. Swine breeders were also stunned when vaccinated pigs collapsed and died. They feared decimation of their herds because of the vaccine; the breeders balked, so the drug manufacturers turned to the Centers For Disease Control in Atlanta for help in recouping the monetary investment - marketing the swine flu vaccine to humans. The Swine flu campaign sponsored by President Ford got off to a bad start when Dr. Anthony Morris, director of the Virus Bureau at the Food and Drug Administration, declared that \"there could be no authentic swine flu vaccine\" because there had never been any cases of swine flu on which they could test it. He then went public with a statement as to the lack of effectiveness of the vacci ne . In order to control the damage to the program done by the public revelations of Dr. Morris, a television program sponsored by CBS was aired. It featured President Ford, who put forth urgent pleas to the American public to get themselves vaccinated against the dreaded \"swine flu\". Ford spoke to as estimated 215 million people in that broadcast, and like lemmings over a cliff they filed down to their local health agencies and were injected, despite statements by various major insurance companies that they would not insure the drug firms against possible lawsuits from the vaccine. It didn't take long for lawsuits to occur. Within two months, claims totaling over a billion dollars had been filed by people who experienced a"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 strange, creeping paralysis induced by the vaccine. Since this kind of paralysis was a new development, referred to as Guillain-Barre Syndrome by the medical establishment, there have been speculations that the epidemic of AIDS which began shortly after Fords public assurances about the swine flu was a variation of the swine flu vaccine. In Matrix 11, however, we presented a document which was the title sheet of the 1970 Defense Appropriations Bill (for 1971) in which $10 million was set aside for the develop- ment of a retro-virus that humans would have no immunity against - essentially a biological weapon. There is also an extract detailing some of the conversation that occurred between some of the members of Congress who were discussing this matter. Based on the apparent evidence, you must decide for yourself about the origin of AIDS. One thing for sure - with the consistent track record of lies and deceit that the government and the medical establish- ment has handed the public over time, you can be sure that whatever they are telling you isn't the case. Connections Between Sma77oox Vaccine and Cancer Another aspect of the smallpox vaccine is its possible relationship to the spread of various forms of cancer. A physician by the name of Dr. W.B. Clark in Indiana finds that \"cancer was practically unknown until compulsory immunization with cowpox vaccine began to be introduced. I have had to deal with at least two hundred cases of cancer, and I never saw a case of cancer in an unvaccinated p,erson.\" Despite this revelation, the American Cancer Society will not follow up on this lead. At the annual American Cancer Society Science Writers Seminar, Dr. Robert W. Simpson of Rutgers University warned that \"immunization programs against flu, measles, mumps, and polio may actually be seeding humans with RNA to form proviruses which will then become latent cells throughout the body ... they can then become activated as a variety of diseases including lupus, cancer, rheumatism and arthritis.\" This reflects very closely what Dr. Herbert Snow of London had noticed. The vaccine, in effect becomes a time-bomb in the system, festering as what are known as \"slow viruses\", which may take ten to thirty years to become virulent. When the time comes, the person is felled by a fatal onslaught, often with no prior warning, whether it is a heart attack or some other di sease ."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"MATRIX III Covert Research in Bio7ogica7 Wea~ons for Po~u7ation Management There have been programs going on behind the scenes that the public is generally not aware of to produce a series of substances generally capable if the complete destruction of whole populations. There are indications that Fort Detrick has been conducting this kind of work under the cover of cancer research. Colonel William D. Tigertt, former commander of the Army's medical unit at Fort Detrick, stated: \"Those who would increase the potency of bio- 1 ogi cal weapons must search for improved methods of mass production of organisms, factors which will enhance the virulence, ways to prolong the storage life of living agents, ways to improve aerosol stability, and methods of producing variant organisms by recombination or by other means. \" This is the general mind set we are dealing with in the United States government. How did this process slip by the public? In 1969, Nixon ordered a halt to offensive biological warfare (BW) research and weapons stockpiling by the United States. The U.S. Army was directed to destroy its toxins, viruses, and bacteria (supposedly) with heat and disinfectants by May 1972; the planned \"disposal\" of the scientific personnel associated with the program was not so easy. Some of these \"biowarriors\" went to the CIA. Others quickly found new support from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), particularly in its Virus Cancer Program (VCP). The NCI funded and supervised some of the same scientists, universities, and contracting corporations (supposedly for cancer research) which had conducted biological warfare research. Some of these medical research contracts ran simultaneously with the U.S. Bio- logical Warfare program. When the military work ended, the civilian programs continued to expand on the same critical areas outlined by Colonel Tigertt. The NCI Viral Cancer Program - a highly politicized public relations effort - was launched in 1971 (the same year that the AIDS virus was allegedly created under a mandate from the WHO) with great fanfare as part of the \"war on cancer\" sponsored by Nixon. The stated aim of the program was to organize experiments aimed'at finding the \"viruses that cause cancer\". Apparently this dubious agenda was compatible with the incorporation into the various units of the VCP of dozens of former U.S. BW researchers who continued to study topics with potential military application. Potential cancer-causing viruses"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 were collected, grown in huge amounts, and distributed through the VCP; thousands of animals were infected in experiments, and the aeroso 7 distribution of cancer- causing viruses was also studied. Two former BW facilities would play a large part in the VCP. The U.S. Army's Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland has been the \"parent research and pilot center for biological warfare.\" During the 196OSs, the CIA paid the facility $100,000 a year for BW and chemical agents and their delivery systems. In Oakland, California, the Naval Biosciences Laboratory was involved in early work with the plague and collaborated in massive open-air tests of bio7ogica1 warfare \"simulates\" in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1950's. From 1953 to 1968, the University of California, while managing the Naval Biosciences Lab (NBL), also had BW contracts with the Army. After U.S. Treaty obligations under the Geneva Convention Agreement of 1972 took effect, work of this kind would prohibit open research on mass production of dangerous viruses without a medical \"cover\". The Viral Cancer Program provided an ideal \"cover\" for continued work. One of the first new priorities of the Fort Detrick facility after the ban was the \"large-scale production of oncogenic (cancer-causing) viruses.\" Within a year, the NCI began mass production and within one 15 month period ending in June 1977, five years after the U.S. had signed an agreement not to produce these products, the VCP produced 60,000 liters of cancer-causi ng and immunosupressive viruses. Throughout . the 1970's, U.S. \"defensive\" BW efforts were increasingly aimed at the research and development of viral disease agents. The Viral Cancer contract ran concurrently with the Naval Biosciences Laboratory's work on bubonic plague, Rift Valley fever, and meningitis. The NBL also performed much of the original research into the plague during World War 11. In retrospect, it seems that the Navy has had top funding for every field of science, including research in gravitation and other areas in physics and biology, since it has always been the key factor in the defense of the United States since its very inception. You will recall that the Navy has had apparent roles in the alleged work at Dreamland on alien craft and had an important part in all the Project Rainbow and Phoenix Projects. The Naval Biosciences Laboratory Cell Culture Project was supervised for the VCP by Dr-James Duff and Dr.Jack Gruber. Duff had been a microbiologist at Fort Detrick for 12 years before joining the NCI. His biography lists"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 research into clostridium botulinum toxins and psittacosis vaccines. Botulinum toxins cause botulism food poisoning and are among the most toxic substances known. It was during the period when Duff was at Fort Detrick that the U.S.Army stockpiled botulinum toxin weapons. After serving for eight years at Fort Oetrick, Gruber moved to the NCU. His biography lists work on \"arthropod borne viruses\". The United States stockpiled BW weapons based on one arthropod-borne virus and studied many others. In 1984, Gruber became head of the Cancer Etiology Division of the National Institutes of Health. After the ban on offensive BW research, the National Cancer Institute and the Office of Naval Research jointly sponsored experiments on the aerosol properties of potentiallyAoncogenic viruses. The NCI project officer and former U.S.Air Force virologist, Dr. Alfred Hellman, worked with Mark Chatigny, a research worker at NBL and a member of the NCI biohazards work group from the NBL. Hellman also oversaw the 1971 $100,000 study on the \"physical and biological characteristics of viral aerosols\". In 1961, the NBL had done similar research for Fort Detrick on the \"stability and virulence of BW aerosols.\" Chatigny's NBL research into aerosol distribution of viruses would continue into the 1980's. Such overlapping of purposes raises serious questions about the wisdom of placing control of VCP viruses under the NBL. The pattern of overlapping military BW and NCI work was paralleled by the relationship between industrial contractors and the Viral Cancer Program. Charles Pfizer and Company, a pharmaceutical firm, had a contract with the NCI which included production of \"a large quantity of a variety of viruses\" for the VCP. The immunosuppressive Mason-Pfizer monkey virus was grown in large quantity, and other anima 1 cancer viruses were adapted to grow in human cell lines. During the same period - 1961 to 1971- as the NCI contractor, Pfizer conducted a secret study for the U.S. Army \"into the growth and culture media for unspecified biological agents.\" As of January 1992, Pfizer is the sixth largest drug company in the world.

In 1971, when Nixon announced that Fort Detrick would be converted into a center for cancer research, the buildings were decontaminated and the facilities were turned over to the NCI, which renamed the facility the Frederick Cancer Research Center. Litton-Bionetics (formerly Bionetics Research from 1966-1968) was named as the prime contractor. Litton Bionetics worked extensively on the disperion of BW agents from aircraft, and included Air Force contracts for \"the supersonic delivery of dry biological agents\". One of Bionetics Research Laboratories' most important .NCI contracts was a massive virus inoculation program that began in 1962 and ran until at least 1976, and used more than 2,000 monkeys. Dr. Robert Gallo, the controversial head of the current United States AIDS research program at NCI and Dr.Jack Gruber were project officers for the inoculation program. The monkeys were injected with everything from human cancer to rare viruses in an effort to find a transmissib 7e cancer. Many of these monkeys died from immunosuppression after infection with the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, the first known immuno- suppressive retrovirus - an class of viruses that includes the human immunodeficiency virus. Under these programs, \"species barriers\" were routinely breached in efforts to find or create infectious cancer viruses. This illustrates another aspect of the NCI BW program. Zoonoses, diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans, make up the majority of BW agents. Now, although the Center for Disease Control has continued to insist that poverty, environment, 'and insects a11 have absolutely nothing to do with AIDS transmission, they sponsored an advertisement in the May 1987 issue of Science magazine seeking a research entomologist who would study \"the role of biting arthropods in transmitting human immunodeficiency (AIDS) virus\". The fact that covert re- search in this area has been conducted for some years under government contracts seems to have been overlooked. There are other inconsistencies. Dr. John Seale, of Richmond, Virginia presided at a conference June 11, 1987, in which he stated positively, that \"AIDS is not a sexua 1 7y transmitted disease. It is a contagious disease which is also transmitted in blood. \" He denounced Dr. Gallo of the National Institute of Health and the Surgeon"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"MATRIX III General of the United States, Dr. Everett Koop, for deliberately spreading disinformation about the disease. Dr. Gal10 was originally famed as having \"discovered\" the humano-immunio-deficiency virus, HIV, which he claimed was the cause of AIDS. After Gallo's discovery, the NIH strangely and consistently denied funds to any scientist whose work failed to bear Gallo's claims.

At issue IS the patent covering the test for detecting the virus, as well as the scientific glory for the remarkable research effort by which the virus was discovered and the detection test created. One of the researchers who was to come into conflict with Dr.Gallo over the \"HIV\" controversy was Dr.Peter Duesberg, professor of virology at the University of California at Berkeley. Duesberg is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He had been brought to Gallo's own laboratory to work under a fellowship grant. After studying HIV in the same laboratory where Gallo had claimed to have made his monumental findings, Duesberg concluded that the HIV virus did not meet the standard criteria for a disease-causing agent. He published his findings in the medial journal Cancer Research, in March 1987 and sat back to wait for Gal10 to justify his conclusions. Gallo made no reply, and also refused to return telephone calls. Despite the claims of Gallo, research indicates that the HIV virus is present only in about half of all AIDS cases, a factor which Dr.Gallo will not explain. It is obvious at this point that the massive government testing program for the presence of HIV is a deliberate fraud being perpetrated by some elements within society on other elements in order to prolong the presence of this virus and the destruction of a significant part of the human population by this genetically engineered virus. It is quite clear from the preceding material that many diseases are introduced into society deliberately to reduce the human population, while at the same time producing enormous sums of money for the chemical, drug,"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"MA TRIX 111 and banking industries, as well as all the ancillary support industries. Some interesting data about some of the worlds lead- ing drug and chemical companies can be found in Appendix I1 at the back of the book. Population Control Aspects of Condom Use It is interesting that the use of condoms is being taught in schools and generally encouraged for acceptance; in 1992 a \"female condom\" was even devised. One aspect of these two factors is that the use of condoms means a lower potential teen pregnancy rate for the next couple of generations. Condoms do not prevent AIDS, as the smallest pore in a condom is 1.7 microns in size and the AIDS virus is about .7 microns in size. Thus this policy of \"using condoms because of AIDS\" will: 1. Increase the spread of AIDS (sexual transmission of the virus is only one of the ways it can spread) and cause more deaths due to AIDS. 2. Theoretically reduce the general birth rate. Drug \"Testing\" on Prison Po~ulations The process for FDA approval of drugs is a long and tedious one which involves clinical testing. Clinical testing goes through three phases. Phase I calls for the . testing of the new drug on a small number of healthy people. Phase I1 requires that \"volunteers\" take the drug during a two year trial basis. Phase I11 calls for more diverse clinical testing on from 1,000 to 3,000 patients over a three year period. Those who prescribe the drug apparently rely on Phase I1 testing to recommend its reliability. Phase 11, in which the drug is tested on human beings, generally requires a captive population. The drugs are sometimes tested secretly in schools, hospitals, and mental institutions, but the pharmaceutical manufacturers usually prefer to rely on a much safer test population, where people who are not in a position to sue or generate unfavorable publicity if the drug turns out to be toxic or have strange side effects. The safest captive population under these guidelines is the prison population. Since the turn of the century, the United States has led the world in the number of medical experiments carried out on prison populations - perhaps exceeded only by the Germans during"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 World War 11. Some people might think it is all right to conduct medical experiments on prisoners, even though a number of German doctors were executed for doing it. Some might think that it is a way for a debt to society to be repaid; an increasing number of people in prisons are not there for criminal behavior but are, in effect, political prisoners who are sent to prison for banking problems, tax problems, or defying the government line. Each year it seems that the number of non-violent prisoners is on the i ncrease . Despite all the concerns, the American Medical Association has always lobbied to continue the practice of drug testing on prisoners. Another related issue is that more political prisoners, which include researchers who make discoveries that would benefit mankind, die in prison than in any other place. My original research began in the area of free energy devices, and my attention was caught immediately by the plight of Wilhelm Reich, who was murdered in prison. New techniques for murdering people in prison include the use of radioactive isotopes to induce sudden, virulent forms of cancer that will kill a person within weeks of .thei r incarceration. Publicity about the use of prisoners in medical experiments surfaced in the 1940's. Wyeth Laboratories incredibly voiced their indignation that the use of prisoners would even be questioned, releasing a statement that \"almost all of our Phase 11 testing is done on prisoners.\" The drug companies Upjohn and Parke-Davis, who makes the yearly flu vaccine Fluogen, used prisoners in Mississippi. Dosages of the drug were typically increased until their was a toxic reaction, confirming that drug tests in prisons are designed primarily to measure the toxicity of drugs rather than their efficiency. I have had mail come in from prisoners in various states that confirm that this is procedure is still going on. Vacaville State Prison in California has been doing drug experiments on prisoners for many years. Testing was done by an outfit called the Solano Institute for Medical and Physical Research - a non-profit corporation under the California charitable trust law. Research indicates that at least 37 drug companies do Phase I1 testing on prisoners, including such leading firms as Upjohn, Lederle, Squibb, and Merck. Again, data about these companies and the people that run them is in Appendix 11.

Valerian Leading Edge Research Group ~.b. Box 481-MU58 Yelm, Washington 98587 Dear V. Valerian: This correspondence is in response to your letter addressed to the Federal Drug ~dministration, Center for Biologics, Evaluation and Research. In your letter you request a variety of information related to the influenza vaccine, and epidemiology of the disease. As your letter is subdivided into five sections, each with different questions, I will structure my response in a similar manner, first restating your question. 1. If the Office of Biologics makes this yearly recommendation, from who or where do they get the data in order to make the annual recommendation? The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) has the responsibility for regulating the Influenza Virus Vaccine. The data used to determine which strains of the virus will be deemed effective in providing protection for the upcoming flu season is obtained from numerous sources. The epidemiology of influenza viruses is based on the isolation and identification of strains from infected people throughout the world. These sources include, .but are not limited to: the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, the United States Armed Forces, and the Food and Drug Administration. CBER uses information on the most recent epidemiology, strain variation and immunologic responses of people to current vaccines in order to inform a panel of experts for recommendations of the appropriate strain of the virus to be included in the yearly formulation of the vaccine. This panel, an Advisory Committee, meets in the late winter of each year to review epidemiological evidence related to the prevalence of influenza viruses. The epidemiological and serological evidence is presented by scientists from the groups listed. I am including the agenda from the January 30, 1992 meeting of the Vaccines ~dvisory Committee meeting which considered the selection of the influenza virus strains, and also a brief document related to flu shots.

At which time period during the year is the recommendation passed to the company who makes the influenza virus? As I stated in my response to your first question, these ~dvisory Committee Meetings generally occur in the late winter, allowing the manufacturers sufficient start-up time to initiate the culture of the virus strains. The manufacturers typically send a representative to the meeting. For the influenza virus~vaccine; there are five active manufacturers with four different products.

Could you provide us with research material which would illustrate the flowing data and statistics: a: Data on the number of confirmed cases of different types of disease conditions and the dates indicated for the past three years. Response: Such data, if available, will be found at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. The CDC is responsible for the epidemiological data related to most of the diseases found in the country. b: Data on the release dates and use of vaccines for the same time period. Response: While I cannot give you the exact release dates, the flu vaccine is generally made available to the public in the late summer/early fall of the year. The information you request concerning the use of vaccines, if available will be found at the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia. There were 36 million doses-of flu vaccine made available last season. c: Data reflecting other recommendations for formulation of other vaccines, other than influenza, and the data upon which such recommendations are based. Currently CBER only regulates this one vaccine subject to yearly reformulations. All of the other vaccines are not formulated on a yearly basis. These other vaccines would include products such as, Polio Vaccine, Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus vaccine, Yellow Fever Vaccine, Rabies Vaccine, to name a few. In the United States, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer and/or developer to investigate a drug product and develop data from laboratory testing and clinical studies that are necessary to support an application for marketing the product. FDA is responsible for reviewing those data that are submitted in support of a product license, and deciding whether they are adequate for granting approval for interstate sale."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"such applications are reviewed for safety and effectiveness in as expeditious a manner as possible. The FDA is sincerely committed to making beneficial products available to patients who need them. However, we must enforce the laws that the Congress has enacted to ensure that we approve only those products that are demonstrated to be safe and effective. Our Agency has a responsibility to ensure that investigational products are tested according to established scientific principles and that valid analyses of benefits and risks are performed. While the need for effective products is critical, well-controlled clinical trials are the best mechanism for obtaining safety and efficacy data that will allow assessment of the role of new drug products in clinical medicine. FDA's policy for the review and approval of products is to maintain an approach that is flexible, but carefully balanced between these concerns and the possibility of worsening, rather than helping, the condition of patients as a result of premature distribution of an unproven drug product. 5.

Changes or new sections include 1) listing of vaccines available in the United States by type and recommended routes, 2) updated schedules for immunizing infants and children, 31 clarification of the guidelines for spacing administration of immune globulin preparations and different vaccines, 4) an updated table of recommendations for routine immunization of children infected with human immunodeficiency virus, 5) listing of conditions that are often inappropriately considered contraindi- cations to immunization, and 6) addition of information on the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. These recommendations are not comprehensive for each vaccine; lmmunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recommenda- tions on each vaccine should be consulted for more details. INTRODUCTION Recommendations for immunizing infants, children, and adults are based on characteristics of immunobiologics, scientific knowledge about the principles of active and passive immunization, and judgments by public health officials and specialists in clinical and preventive medicine. Benefits and risks are associated with the use of all immunobiologics: no vaccine is completely safe or completely effective. Benefits of immunization range from partial to complete protection against the conse- quences of disease (which range from mild or asymptomatic infection to severe consequences, such as paralysis or death); risks of immunization range from common, trivial, and inconvenient side effects to rare, severe, and life-threatening conditions. Thus, recommendations for immunization practices balance scientific evidence of benefits, costs, and risks to achieve optimal levels of protection against infectious diseases. These recommendations describe this balance and attempt to minimize the risks by providing specific advice regarding dose, route, and spacing of immunobiologics and delineating situations that warrant precautions or contraindicate their use. They are recommendations for use in the United States because epidemiologic circumstances and vaccines often differ in other countries. Individual circumstances may warrant deviations from these recommendations. The relative balance of benefits and risks can change as diseases are controlled or eradicated. For example, because smallpox has been eradicated throughout the world, the risk of complications associated with smallpox vaccine now exceeds the risk of the disease; consequently, smallpox vaccination of civilians is now indicated only for laboratory workers directly involved with smallpox or closely related orthopox viruses (e.g., monkeypox and vaccinia). DEFINITIONS lmmunobiologic lmmunobiologics include both antigenic substances, such as vaccines and toxoids, and antibody- containing preparations, including globulins and antitoxins, from human or animal donors. These products are used for active or passive immunization or therapy. Examples include: Vaccine (Table 1): A suspension of live (usually attenuated) or inactivated microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, or rickettsiae) or fractions thereof administered to induce immunity and thereby prevent infectious disease.

VAERS is designed to accept all reports of suspected adverse events after administration of vaccine, in a11 age groups, including but not limited to those mandated by - the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. Your fbll participation is essential in establishing an accurate database of adverse events associated with vaccines. This feedback helps to direct initiatives in developing and improving - the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Whenever you report an adverse event to VAERS, you will receive verification of receipt of your report. For certain serious adverse events, you will be contacted regarding the patient's condition at 60 days and again at 1 year. I am pleased to report that your cooperation has contributed greatly to the successful implementation of this new program. since initiation of the program in November 1990, we have received over 2,500 reports.

Some vaccines contain trace amounts of antibiotics to which patients may be hypersensitive. The information provided in the vaccine package insert should be carefully reviewed before a decision is made whether the rare patient with such hypersensitivity should be given the vaccine(s). No currently recommended vaccine contains penicillin or its derivatives. MMR and its individual component vaccines contain trace amounts of neomycin. Although the amount present is less than would usually be used for the skin test to determine hypersensitivity, persons who have experienced anaphylactic reactions to neomycin should not be given these vaccines. Most often, neomycin allergy is a contact dermatitis, a manifestation of a delayed-type (cell-mediated) immune response rather than anaphylaxis. A history of delayed-type reactions to neomycin is not a contraindication for these vaccines. Bacterial vaccines, such as cholera, DTP, plague, and typhoid, are frequently associated with local or systemic adverse effects, such as redness, soreness, and fever. These reactions are difficult to link with a specific sensitivity to vaccine components and appear to be toxic rather than hypersensitive. On rare occasions, urticaria1 or anaphylactic reactions in DTP, DT, or Td recipients have been reported. When such events are reported, appropriate skin tests should be performed to determine sensitivity to tetanus toxoid before its use is discontinued (6 ). ALTERED IMMUNOCOMPETENCE Virus replication after administration of live, attenuated-virus vaccines can be enhanced in persons with immunodeficiency diseases and in persons with suppressed capacity for immune response as occurs with leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, symptomatic HIV infections, or therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radistion, or large amounts of corticosteroids. Severe compli- cations have followed vaccination with live, attenuated-virus vaccines and with live-bacteria vaccines (e.g., BCG) in patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or suppressed immune responses. in general, these patients should not be given live vaccines, with the exceptions noted below. If polio immunization is indicated for immunosuppressed patients, their household members, or other close contacts, these persons should be given IPV rather than OPV. Although a protective immune response cannot be assured in the immunocompromised patient, some protection may be provided. Because of the possibility of immunodeficiency in other children born to a family in which one such case has occurred, no family members should receive OPV unless the immune statuses of the intended recipient and all other children in the family are known. Patients with leukemia in remission whose chemotherapy has been terminated for at least 3 months can be given live-virus vaccines.

The growing number of infants and preschoolers infected with HIV has directed special attention to the appropriate immunization of such children. The evaluation and testing for HIV infection of asymptomatic children presenting for vaccines is not necessary before decisions concerning immu- nization are made. The inactivated childhood vaccines (e.g., DTP or HbCV) should be given to HIV-infected children regardless of whether HIV symptoms are present. Although OPV has not been harmful when administered to asymptomatic HIV-infected children, IPV is the vaccine of choice if the child is known to be infected. The use of IPV not only eliminates any theoretical risk to the vaccinee but also prevents the possibility of vaccine virus spread to immunocompromised close contacts. Asymp- tomatically infected persons in need of MMR should receive it. Also, MMR should be considered for all symptomatic HIV-infected children since measles disease can be severe in symptomatic HIV-infected children. Limited studies of MMR immunization in both asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV-infected patients have not documented serious or unusual adverse events. In addition, pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for any child infected with HIV. Influenza vaccine is recommended for children with symptoms of HIV infection (Table 7). FEBRILE ILLNESS The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of a current or recent febrile illness depends largely on the severity of symptoms and on the etiology of the disease. Although a moderate or severe febrile illness is reason to postpone immunizations, minor illnesses such as mild upper-respiratory infections (URI) with or without low-grade fever are not contraindica- tions for vaccination. In persons whose compliance with medical care cannot be assured, it is particularly important to take every opportunity to provide appropriate vaccinations. Children with moderate or severe febrile illnesses can be vaccinated as soon as the child has recovered. This precaution to wait avoids superimposing adverse effects of the vaccine on the underlying illness or mistakenly attributing a manifestation of the underlying illness to the vaccine. Routine physical examinations or measuring temperatures are not prerequisites for vaccinating infants and children who appear to be in good health. Asking the parent or guardian if the child is ill, postponing vaccination in those with moderate or severe febrile illnesses, and immunizing those without contraindications to vaccination are appropriate procedures in childhood immunization programs. . - TABLE 7.

Sudden infant death syndrome ISIDS) has occurred in infants following administration of DTP. A large case- control study of SlOS in the United States showed that receipt of DTP was not causally related to SlDS (9). It should be recognized that the first three primary immunizing doses of DTP are usually administered to infants 2-6 months old and that approximately 85% of SlDS cases occur at ages 1-6 months. with the peak incidence occurring at 6 weeks4 months of age. By chance alone. some SlDS victims can be expected to have recently re- ceived vaccine. Onset of infantile spasms has occurred in infants who have recently received DTP or DT. Analysis of data from the NCES on children with infantile spasms showed that receipt of DTP or DT was not causally related to in- fantile spasms 1101. The incidence of onset of infantile spasms increases at 3-9 months of age, the time period in which the second and'third doses of DTP are generally given. Therefore. some cases of infantile spasms can be expected to be related by charrce alone to recent receipt of DTP. Reporting of Adverse Events Reporting by parents and patients of all adverse events occurring within 4 weeks of antigen administration should be encouraged. Adverse events that require a visit to a health-care provider should be reported by health- care providers to manufacturers and local or state health departments. The information will be forwarded to an appropriate federal agency Ithe Bureau of Biologics Research and Review, FDA,. or CDC). COMMENTS ON USING REDUCED DOSAGE SCHEDULES OR MULTIPLE SMALL DOSES The AClP recommends giving only the full dose of DTP; if a specific contraindication to DTP exists, none should be given.

Occasionally. a nodule may be palpable at the injection site of adsorbed products for several weeks. Abscesses at the site of injection have been reported (6-10 per million doses). Mild systemic reactions. such as fever, drowsiness, fretfulness. and anorexia, occur quite frequently. These reactions are significantly more common following DTP than following DT, are usually self-limited, and need no therapy other than, perhaps. symptomatic treatment (e.g., antipyretics). Moderate to severe systemic events, such as fever of 40.5 C (1 05 F) or higher, persistent. inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours or more, unusual high-pitched crying, collapse, or convulsions. occur relatively infrequently. Other more severe neurologic complications. such as a prolonged convulsion or an encephalopathy, occasionally fatal, have been reported to be assoc~ated with DTP administration, although rarely. Approximate rates for adverse events following receipt of DTP vaccine (regardless of dose number in the series) are indicated in Table 3 (5.6 1. The frequency of local reactions and fever following DTP vaccination is significantly higher with ~ncreasing numbers of doses of DTP, while other mild to moderate systemic reactions (e.g., fretfulness, vomiting) are signifi- cantly less frequent (5). If local redness of 2.5 cm or greater occurs. the likelihood of recurrence after another DTP dose increases significantly ( 71.

Among children known to be neurologically normal before entering the study. the relative risks of a neurolpgic illness occurring within the 7-day period following receipt of DTP dose, com- pared to children not receiving DTP vaccine in the 7-day period before onset of their illness, was 3.3 (p < 0.001). Within this 7-day period. the risk was significantly increased for immunized children only within 3 days of vaccination (relative risk 4.2, p < 0.001 I. The relative risk for illness occurring 4-7 days after vaccination was 2.1 (0.235 < p < 0.1 1. The attributable risk estimates for a serious acute neurologic disorder within 7 days after DTP vaccine (regardless of outcome) was one in 1 10,000 doses of DTP, and for a permanent neurologic deficit, one in 310,000 doses. No specific clinical syndrome was identified. Overall. DTP vaccine accounted for only a small proportion of cases of serious neurologic disorders reported in the population studied. Although there are uncertainties in the reported studies. recent data suggest that infants and young children who have had previous convulsions (whether febrile or nonfebrile) are more likely to have seizures following DTP than those without such histories (8 1."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"MATRIX XI1 A Shot in the Dark?

RR-7): 1-15 and the clarification, MMWR 1990;39:469.) The primary changes include statements about the influenza strains in the trivalent vaccine for 1991-1992. INTRODUCTION Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes on the basis of two surface antigens: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Three subtypes of hemagglutinin (HI, H2, H3) and two subtypes of neuraminidase (N1, N2) are recognized among influenza A viruses that have caused widespread human disease. Immunity to these antigens-especially to the hemagglutinin-reduces the likelihood of infection and lessens the severity of disease if infection occurs. Infection with a virus of one subtype confers little or no protection against viruses of other subtypes. Furthermore, over time, antigenic variation (antigenic drift) within a subtype may be so marked that infection or vaccination with one strain may not induce immunity to distantly related strains of the same subtype. Although influenza B viruses have shown more antigenic stability than influenza A viruses, antigenic variation does occur. For these reasons, major epidemics of respiratory disease caused by new variants of influenza continue to occur. The antigenic characteristics of strains currently circulating 'provide the basis for selecting virus strains to include in each year's vaccine. Typical influenza illness is characterized by abrupt onset of fever, myalgia, sore throat, and nonproductive cough. Unlike other common respiratory infections, influenza can cause severe malaise lasting several days. More severe illness can result if primary influenza pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia occur. During influenza epidemics, high attack rates of acute illness result in increased numbers of visits to physicians' offices, walk-in clinics, and emergency rooms and increased hospitalizations for management of lower-respiratory-tract complications. Elderly persons and persons with underlying health problems are at increased risk for complications of influenza infection. If infected, such high-risk persons or groups (listed as \"groups at increased risk for influenza-related complications\" under Target Groups for Special Vaccination Programs) are more likely than the general population to require hospitalization. During major epidemics, hospitalization rates for high-risk persons may increase 2- to 5-fold, depending on the age group. Previously healthy children and younger adults may also require hospitalization for influenza-related complications, but the relative increase in their hospitalization rates is less than for persons who belong to high-risk groups. An increase in mortality further indicates the impact of influenza epidemics. Increased mortality results not only from influenza and pneumonia but also from cardiopulmonary and other chronic diseases that can be exacerbated by influenza infection. At least 10,000 excess deaths have been documented in each of 19 different U.S. epidemics in the period 1957-1986; more than 40,000 excess deaths occurred in each of three of these epidemics. Approximately 80%-90% of the excess deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza were among persons 2 65 years of age. Because the proportion of elderly persons in the U.S. population is increasing and because age and its associated chronic diseases are risk factors for severe influenza illness, the toll from influenza can be expected to increase unless control measures are used more vigorously. The number of younger persons at increased risk for influenza-related complications is also increasing for various reasons, such as the success of neonatal intezsive care units, better management of diseases such as cystic fibrosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and better survival rates for organ- transplant recipients. OPTIONS FOR THE CONTROL OF INFLUENZA Two measures available in the United States that can reduce the impact of influenza are immunoprophylaxis with inactivated (killed-virus) vaccine and chemoprophylaxis or therapy with an"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"influenza-specific antiviral drug (e.g., amantadine). Vaccination of high-risk persons each year before the influenza season is currently the most effective measure for reducing the impact of influenza. Vaccination can be highly cost-effective when a) it is directed at persons who are most likely to experience complications or who are at increased risk for exposure, and b) it is administered to high-risk persons during hospitalization or a routine health-care visit before the influenza season, thus making special visits to physicians' offices or clinics unnecessary. Recent reports indicate that-when vaccine and epidemic strains of virus are well matched-achieving high vaccination rates among closed populations can reduce the risk of outbreaks by inducing herd immunity. Other indications for vaccination include the strong desire of any person to avoid influenza infection, reduce the severity of disease, or reduce the chance of transmitting influenza to high-risk persons with whom' the individual has frequent contact. The antiviral agent available for use at this time (amantadine hydrochloride) is effective only against influenza A and, for maximum effectiveness as prophylaxis, must be used throughout the period of risk. When used as either prophylaxis or therapy, the potential effectiveness of amantadine must be balanced against potential side effects. Chemoprophylaxis is not a substitute for vaccination. Recommendations for chemoprophylaxis are provided primarily to help health-care providers make decisions regarding persons who are at greatest risk of severe illness and complications if infected with an influenza A virus. Use of amantadine may be considered a) as a control measure when influenza A outbreaks occur in institutions housing high-risk persons, both for treatment of ill individuals and as prophylaxis for others; b) as short-term prophylaxis after late vaccination of high-risk persons (i.e., when influenza A infections are already occurring in the community) during the period when immunity is developing in response to vaccination; c) as seasonal prophylaxis for individuals for whom vaccination is contraindicated; d) as seasonal prophylaxis for immunocompromised individuals who may not produce protective levels of antibody in response to vaccination; and e) as prophylaxis for unvaccinated health-care workers and household contacts who care for high-risk persons either for the duration of influenza activity in the community or until immunity develops after vaccination. Amantadine is also approved for use by any person who wishes to reduce his or her chances of becoming ill with influenza A. INACTIVATED VACCINE FOR INFLUENZA A AND B lnfluenza vaccine is made from highly purified, egg-grown viruses that have been rendered noninfectious (inactivated). Therefore, the vaccine cannot cause influenza. Each year's influenza vaccine contains three virus strains (usually two type A and one type 0) representing influenza viruses believed likely to circulate in the United States in the upcoming winter. The composition of the vaccine is such that it rarely causes systemic or febrile reactions. Whole-virus, subvirion, and purified- surface-antigen preparations are available. To minimize febrile reactions, only subvirion or purified- surface-antigen preparations should be used for children; any of the preparations may be used for adults. Most vaccinated children and young adults develop high postvaccination hemagglutination- inhibition antibody titers that are protective against infection by strains similar to those in the vaccine or the related variants that may emerge during outbreak periods. Elderly persons and persons with certain chronic diseases may develop lower postvaccination antibody titers than healthy young adults, and thus may remain susceptible to influenza upper-respiratory-tract infection. Nevertheless, even if such persons develop influenza illness, the vaccine has been shown to be effective.in preventing lower-respiratory-tract involvement or other complications, thereby reducing the risk of hospitalization and death. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USE OF INFLUENZA VACCINE Influenza vaccine is strongly recommended for any person 26 months of age who-because of age or underlying medical condition-is at increased risk for complications of influenza. Health-care workers and others (including household members) in close contact with high-risk persons should also be vaccinated. In addition, influenza vaccine may be given to any person who wishes to reduce the chance of becoming infected with influenza. The trivalent influenza vaccine prepared for the 1991-1992"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"season will include A/Taiwan/ll86-like(H1N1), NBeijingl353189-like (H3N2), and B/Panama/45/90-like hemagglutinin antigens. Recommended doses are listed in Table 1. Guidelines for the use of vaccine among different groups follow. Although the current influenza vaccine can contain one or more antigens used in previous years, annual vaccination using the current vaccine is necessary because immunity for an individual declines in the year following vaccination. Because the 1991-1992 vaccine differs from the 1990-1991 vaccine, supplies of 1990-1991 vaccine should not be used to provide protection for the 1991-1992 influenza season. Two doses may be required for a satisfactory antibody response among previously unvaccinated children c9 years of age; however, studies with vaccines similar to those in current use have shown little or no improvement in antibody responses when a second dose is given to adults during the same season. During the past decade, data on influenza vaccine immunogenicity and side effects have been obtained when vaccine has been administered intramuscularly. Because there has been no adequate evaluation of recent influenza vaccines administered by other routes, the intramuscular route is the one recommended for use. Adults and older children should be vaccinated in the deltoid muscle, and infants and young children in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. TARGET GROUPS FOR SPECIAL VACCINATION PROGRAMS To maximize protection of high-risk persons, they and their close contacts should be targeted for orpanized vaccination programs.

Except in years of pandemic influenza (e.g., 1957 and 1968). high levels of influenza activity rarely occur in the contiguous 48 states before December. Therefon, November is the optimal time for organized vaccination campaigns for high-risk persons. In facilities such as nursing homes, it is particularly important to avoid administering vaccine too far in advance of the influenza season because antibody levels begin declining within a few months. Vaccination programs may be undertaken as soon as current vaccine is available if regional influenza activity is expected to begin earlier than December. Children <9 years of age who have not previously been vaccinated should receive two doses of vaccine at least a month apart to maximize the chance of a satisfactory antibody response to all three vaccine antigens. The second dose should be given before December, if possible. Vaccine should be offered to both children and adults up to and even after influenza virus activity is documented in a community, as late as April in some years. ANTIVIRAL AGENTS FOR INFLUENZA A The two antiviral agents with specific activity against influenza A viruses are amantadine hydro- chloride and rimantadine hydrochloride. Only amantadine is licensed for use in the United States. These chemically related drugs interfere with the replication cvcle of tvDe A lbllttV~e B) influenza y~~)ompletely understood. When given prophylactically to healthy young adults or children in advance of and throughout the epidemic period, amantadine is approximately 70%-90% effective in preventing illnesses caused by naturally occurring strains of type A influenza viruses. When administered to otherwise healthy young adults and children for symptomatic treatment within 48 hours after the onset of influenza illness, amantadine has been shown to reduce the duration of fever and other systemic symptoms and may permit a more rapid return to routine daily activities. Since antiviral agents taken prophylactically may prevent illness but not subclinical infection, some persons who take these drugs may still develop immune responses that will protect them when exposed to antigenically related viruses in later years. As with all drugs, symptoms may occur that are side effects of amantadine among a small proportion of persons. Such symptoms are rarely severe, but may be important for some categories of patients. Development of Drug-Resistant Viruses Amantadine-resistant influenza viruses can emerae when amantadine is used for treatment. The fre&ency with wn~ch resistant isolates emerge and the extent of their transmission are unknown, but there is no evidence that amantadine-resistant viruses are more virulent or more transmissible than amantadine-sensitive viruses. Thus the use of amantadine remains an appropriate outbreak control measure. In closed populations such as nursing homes, persons who have influenza and are treated with amantadine should be separated, if possible, from asymptomatic persons who are given amantadine as prophylaxis. Because of possible induction of amantadine resistance, it is advisable to discontinue amantadine treatment of persons who have influenza-like illness as soon as clinically warranted, generally within 3-5 days. Isolation of influenza viruses from persons who are receiving amantadine should be reported through state health departments to CDC and the isolates saved for antiviral sensitivity testing.

Respira- tory disease after vaccination represents coincidental illness unrelated to influenza vaccination. The most frequent side effect of vaccination is soreness at the vaccination site that lasts for up to 2 days; this is reported for fewer than one-third of vaccinees. In addition, two types of systemic raactions have occurred: 1.. Fever, malaise, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms occur infrequently and most often affect persons who have had no exposure to the influenza virus antigens in the vaccine (e.g., young children). These reactions begin 6-12 hours after vaccination and can persist for 1 or 2 days. 2. Immediate-presumably allergic-reactions (such as hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, or systemic anaphylaxis) occur rarely after influenza vaccination. These reactions probably result from hypersensitivity to some vaccine component-most likely residual egg protein. Although current influenza vaccines contain only a small quantity of egg protein, this protein presumably induces immediate hypersensitivity reactions among persons with severe egg allergy. Persons who have developed hives, have had swelling of the lips or tongue, or experienced acute respiratory distress or collapse after eating eggs should not be given the influenza vaccine. Persons with documented immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to eggs-including those who have had occupational asthma or other allergic responses from exposure to egg protein-may also be at increased risk for reactions from influenza vaccine. The protocol for influenza vaccination developed by Murphy and Strunk may be considered for patients who have egg allergies and medical conditions that place them at increased risk for influenza infection or its complications (See Murphy and Strunk, 1985). Unlike the 1976 swine influenza vaccine, subsequent vaccines prepared froni other virus strains have not been clearly associated with an increased frequency of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Although influenza vaccination can inhibit the clearance of warfarin and theophylline, studies have failed to show any adverse clinical effects attributable to these drugs among patients receiving influenza vaccine.

WHO has coordina- ted the investigation of 173 rumors of smallpox between 1979 and 1984 (5-7). All have been diseases other than smallpox, most commonly chickenpox or other rash illnesses.

What is a retrovirus? The term \"retrovirus\" is derived from the fact that these viruses, which cannot reproduce themselves outside of living tissue, contain a substance called \"reverse transcriptase\" (RT), which is an enzyme that is contained in specific animal and human viruses that is in RNA form. These enzymes are responsible for duplication of the genetic material of the virus. Human genetic material is in a DNA form. The RT in retroviruses such as HTLV has the ability to duplicate itself into a DNA format when inside the human cell and insert itself into the human DNA. Henceforth, the \"loaded\" human DNA will then produce more HTLV viruses during the process of destruction of the human cell. The immune system of the human body consists primarily of \"8-cells\", which control production of antibodies and bacterial infections, and \"T-cells\", which control infections that are opportunistic in nature, such as cancer, leumekia, t.uberculosis, and lastly, pneumocystis carnii pneumonia and karposi sarcoma, diseases that are hallmarks of HTLV infection. HTLV retroviruses selectively destroy the T4 cells of the immune system in the human body. Let's examine the \"AIDS virus situation\". It appears that most people are assuming that there is \"one AIDS virus\"; this view is far from what is actually occurring. There are in fact six major variants of the HTLV virus, and each of them has an extremely large number (as we'll see later) of possible genetic combinations. What are the six major groups? HTLV-1 @ Responsible for T-cell Leukemia Magnesium Dependent Proliferative in Tissue Cultures HTLV-2 @ Responsible for Harri-cel 1 Leukemia Magnesium Dependent Proliferative in Tissue Cultures HTLV-3 @ Responsible for what is viewed as \"AIDS\" Magnesium Dependent Destructive in Tissue Cultures HTLV-4 @ Also known as HIV-11. Same as above. HTLV-5 @ Causes Mycosis Fungoides -6 @ * A clone varient.of HTLV-1. 020 0-c)."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Where did these human retroviruses come from? Retroviruses used to be found exclusively in the animal kingdom and were never, until recently, found in humans. If you examine the retroviruses of cattle, you will find Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLv), which has the exact appearance, morphology, molecular weight, and magnesium dependency of HTLV-1. BLV has the same ability to produce T-cell leukemia in cattle as the HTLV-1 retrovirus does in humans. If you look at Bovine Sinsitial Virus (BSV), it has the same appearance, morphology, molecular weight, and magnesium dependency of HTLV-2, and produces HCL in cattle. If you look at Bovine Visna Virus (BVV), it has the same appearance, morphology, molecular weight, and magnesium dependency as HTLV-3, which is commonly referred to as AIDS when manifested in humans. Interestingly, it was found in 1974 that either BSV or BVV was found to be producing Pneumocystis Carnii Pneumonia in chimps. A11 the various human retroviruses have striking similarities to retroviruses previously found only in cattle and sheep. How could animal viruses get into humans? If you infect a human cell culture with BLV and BSV, you will produce more BLV and BSV, p7us recombinant viruses which are a mixture of the two (HTLV-3, HTLV-4), just as the genetic material in human children is a recombination of the genetic material from human parents. Prediction of the AIDS Epidemic In 1973 J. Clemenson, from the Danish Cancer Registry, spoke in front of an international assembly of leukemia experts at a conference on leukemogenesis. He said: \"We are in fact establishing conditions for a possible pandemic of an oncogenic virus varied on the scale of the influenza epidemic of 1918. It is possible to visual- ize the mutation of a virus into a variety highly contagious to man, resulting in a epidemic before we could develop a vaccine.\" Harbingers of things to come? What she is saying is that because of serial passage of viruses during tissue culturing, that a new virus will develop. Is this not what happened with \"AIDS\"? In 1971, two years earlier, an article was produced by Stuart A. Aaronson called \"Common Genetic Alterations of RNA Tumor Viruses Grown in Human Cells\". His report was about the experiments were RNA-based viruses of mice were grown in human tissue cultures, where they adapted and would thereafter grow only in human tissue. In 1972, this idea was expanded, and an article was published by Koshi Maruyama and Leon Dmochowski called \"Cross Species Transmission of Mammalian RNA Tumor O 2 O 0-0"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"MATRIX XI1 Viruses\". They showed that you could adpet viruses having their origin in one species to grow in another by a process of adaptation. The Request In 1972, that same year, the Bulletin of the World Health Organization (WHO) said: \"An attempt should be made to ascertain whether viruses can in fact exert selective effects on immune function, depressing 7s vs. 19s antibodies or by effecting T-cell as opposed to B-cell function. The possibility should be looked into that the immune response to the virus itself may be impaired if the effective viruses damage, more or less selectively, the cells that would respond to the viral antigens.\" What they are saying is \"let's make a virus that effectively inhibits the T-cells of man\". Doesn't HTLV satisfy those criteria? Is it a mere coincidence that we have an epidemic of T-cell-destroying virus? This question was discussed in an article which appeared in the London Times on May 11, 1987 entitled \"Smallpox Vaccine Triggered AIDS Virus\", written by London Times Science Editor Pearce Wright. The article caused a furor in Europe and Latin America but was surpressed in the papers in the United States. If you made HTLV viruses would you want anyone to know? No. The article addressed the associ ation between the WHO Small pox vacci ne programs in Africa and the outbreak of AIDS. The conclusion ws that the WHO vaccines were associated with the outbreak of AIDS. Allegedly, the article was produced after a distraught researcher, who had been paid by the WHO to conduct just such a study the year before, threw it on Wright's desk at the London Times saying, \"there, if you want to know about AIDS in Africa, look at this.\" There are many cases where the government has deliberately infected people. Beginning in the 1930's and 194OPs, the government del i berate1 y infected a group of black males with syphilis at Tuskegee University in Alabama and subsequently denied them access to penicillin, which resulted in the infection of their wives and the development of syphilitic black children. The \"experiment\" is detailed in a book entitled \"Bad Blood\" by James Jones. In fact, between 1959 and 1970, the United States Government did over 300 biological \"experiments\" on unsuspecting American citizens. There are many sources which document this, among them \"A Higher Form of Ki 11 ing: The Secret Story of Chemical and Biological Warfare\", by Richard Harris. Back to WHO and Smallpox vaccine. How was the Smallpox produced? A cow would be injected with the virus and would"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 develop viral antibodies, which would be drawn off in the form of fluids and scabs from the open woound. Obviously, any virus that contaminated the cow would also contaminate the smallpox vaccine preparation. Injecting a vaccine with BSV,BLV, or BVV virus would contaminate the humans, and a virus would adapt itself to a human host. In 1981, Sedrick Mimms, writing in the journal \"Microbiological Reviews\" stated that \"bovine visna virus (BVV) was a known contaminant of fetal calf serum.\" This means that in 1981, at the same time that the AIDS virus was \"discovered\", they had identified a relative of the AIDS virus in calf serum that was used for vaccine tissue cultures, and that this medium was present in tissue cultures worldwide. What will happen in the next few years with the AIDS epidemic? To really understand about the nature and morpho- logy of retroviruses, you have to consult veterinary experts, as most medical doctors have had little or no experience with these types of diseases. According to veterinary experts, when you see one \"index\" case of a virus, there are 99 cases that are to follow or support that one case. With 50,000 cases of AIDS evident, over 5 million people are actually infected. The CDC says this number is 1.5 million. A large discrepancy. The HTLV viruses are so-called \"slow viruses\", meaning that they are resident in human beings for a long time. The Centers For Disease Control says that HTLV viruses will manifest themselves in 3 to 5 years after initial infection. Veterinary virologists, who know what they are talking about, say that retroviruses occur over a period equal to 20% of the life-span of the species infected. For a human it would be 7 to 14 years before you saw the symptoms after initial exposure. If a vaccine could be produced, you would not know if it was really effective until 14 to 20 years had elapsed. Slow viral diseases spread in a geometric progression. The CDC estimates about the number of cases of HTLV-3 in Africa indicate that betweeen 40 to 75 million people are infected. Using knowledge from veternary virologists to predict the spread of HTLV is easy. The entire continent will be dead in 10 to 15 years. Within the United States, it would take less than 10 years for the entire country to be exposed. The problem is compounded when you realize that there are 6 variant groups of HTLV viruses. The blood supply in the United States is not screened for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 - only HTLV 3. People are not generally screened for anything other than HTLV-3. Taking this into consideration, we should be seeing a massive increase in cancers, leukemias and tuberculosis. Unfortunately, that is just what is happening, isn't it? Research also seems to indicate that the appearance of HTLV related disease in New York and San Francisco coincided with WHO Hepatitis-B vaccinations of the young, white homo- sexual popualtion in those areas. 8280-S"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Is \"AIDS\" a Sexually Transmitted Disease? Again and again, the Centers for Disease Control maintain that \"AIDS\" is a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Does the virus meet the criteria for a STD? A STD grows in the venereal tract (which HTLV does not), is present as a live organism within semen (which HTLV is not), lives outside the body for an extended period of time (HTLV cannot live for more than 14 days in air), and can be transferred during sexual contact. It is not currently understood whether HTLV viruses are trans- ferred as free viral particles or transferred inside cellular material. What we do know is that \"intimate contact\" will transfer the virus. It IS known that the virus is present in saliva, so you can be intimate with someone during the sexual act and transfer the virus - but it wasn't by virture of the sexual act itself. Disinformation? Why would they continue to give out possible disinformation? Why wear condoms (the HTLV virus is .15 microns in size - the smallest pore in a condom is 1.5 microns in size - it would not stop the virus if it were present) or abstain from sex? Is the ulterior motive a part of population control? Is it because the fewer people there are the quicker the 2 billion kill-off goal will be met by the year 2000? Food for thought. Other advisories by the CDC say that HTLV cannot be transferred through blood-sucking insects. In fact, there are close relatives to HTLV that are transferred by blood- sucking insects. Equine Infectious Anemia (Horses), Caprii Arthritis Encephalitis (Goats), Bovine Leukemia Virus (Cows), Bovine Visna Virus (Cows), and the Visna (Brain-rot) Virus of Sheep are all known to be carried by blood-sucking insects. Why are they telling the population that it is not true? So the population will not take precautions - the same is true with the other information the government disseminates about HTLV viruses. AIDS - \"The Vaccine\" The HTLV viruses contain genes which contain approximately 9000 base-pairs. Each base pair has four combinations, which means that there are 9000 x 9000 x 9000 x 9000, or (90004) possible HTLV viruses for EACH of the HTLV groups. Instead of being a single virus for which a \"vaccine\" can be developed, there is a menagerie. Every \"AIDS\" virus that has ever been isolated is different, since it interacts with the tissue of the specific host it is in. Retroviruses are also known to spontaneously mutate at the rate of 1% per year. The actual purpose of \"vaccination\" is to produce anti- bodies inside the host. However, the nature of these retro- viruses is that they interfere with the ability of the body to produce antibodies - even if a vaccine could be developed, it would cause people to die even more rapidly. 0 2 0 0-E"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"MA TRIX 111 This leads to the intriguing question. If they know that a vaccine, as it is currently understood, cannot be developed, where is all the \"research\" money going? The same place all the \"research\" money for cancer is going - into the pockets of those who wish you not to exist. Is it possible, within \"current technology\" to eradicate AIDS even if there WERE a vaccine? There are certain pre- requisites that MUST be met for a disease to be eradicatable. According to virologists, one can RULE OUT eradication of a viral disease if: (1) \"The disease grows in wild animals and essentially has an animal reservoir\". We know that HTLV does. (2) \"The disease persists in human beings for an extended period of time.\" We know that HTLV viruses are slow viruses with a 7 to 14 years incubation period. (3) \"The disease has multiple sereological types.\" There are six HTLV viruses, each with 90004 combinations. (4) \"The necessary degree of social cooperation cannot be obtained\". This is insured by keeping the population in ignorance about the true attributes of the disease. Therefore, HTLV viruses violate all four of these condftions - it cannot, in the normal sense, be eradicated, and will be on the planet for a long time. Is There Hope? The use of AZT and other drugs to attack the symptoms of HTLV are misnomers. The AZT, although it interferes with the production of the HTLV virus in the body, also kills the cells of the body. So, AZT and a11 the other substances that are being pressed forward on the public at enormous cost (it costs upwards of $2000 per year to remain on AZT, which reaps potential profits for Committee of 300 drug companies) actually helps insure the death of the patient. In answer to the question \"is there hope?\", the answer is YES. Experiments at Baylor University where HTLV laden blood has been irradiated with low-power laser light (which does not kill the blood cells but kills the virus) indicate, along with the experiments of Royal Raymond Rife, that the crystalline nature of viruses may be their Achilles heal. The viruses can be disrupted by light (or other electromagnetics) that exceed what Rife called the \"Mortal Oscillatory Rate\" of the virus. If the MOR is exceeded, the virus shatters. There is an.article elsewhere in the book that discusses the use of \"radar\" in just this way."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"A REPORT ON THE ABUSE OF POWER Edltor: Antony C.

Up to the Food and Drug Act of 1906. medicine of vvying quality and efficacy was freely available: this Act created 3 Food and Drug Administntion with a bureaucracy to dererminlt whether specific drugs were \"safe\" and whether they should legally be offered to the public. Simuluneously. from the evly 1900's onwards. came :he rise of the American Medical Association (AMA), the organizational leader of the medicai community. The AMA set up 3 hichi\\* sm~ctured nnwh to re . In cancer. the entire emphasis was placed on finding cytotoxic against i.e. ueaunents that directly kill cancer cells. In practice, this evolved into almost ton1 emphasis (at least until recent yeus) on drugs (chemo therapy) and surgical techniques. The structured research approach precluded investigation of dozens of other concepts and the FDA's clout made sure that ueatments outside surgery and cytotoxic agents found no role . . . ,AMA and FD.4 have roo, Yet even before 1906 alternate ncaanents were considered wonhy of scientific investigation . . . in 1904, for example, it was found that the enzyme papain (from papaya) might have beneficial effect in cancer. However. the AIMA especially under Monis Fishbein, editor of the Journal of the American Medicd Association from 1924 to 1949, conducted vicious crusades against treatment or . procedure that did not come within the narrow guidelines laid down by AMA. Using a Committee on Quackery and a Depment of Investigations (both eliminated in 1975) Fishbein was the spearhead of atncks against any medical practice outside the AMA.

Probably most doctors in the period 1920 to 1970 were unaware that medicine was confined to extremely nmw routes and that fundamentally different ways of looking at the human body and its ills existed. By the 1950's and 1960's medical specialists themselves began to question the onhodox system and we had books like Dr. Robert Becker. THE BODY ELECTRIC, and Dr. Richard Gerber, VIBRATIONAL MEDICINE. More radically we had doctors developing cancer rreatments outside the cytotoxic agent- surgery procedure. we had the rise of so-called unconventional practitioners, and a polarized war over cancer therapies. The AMA and the FDA were backed by the legal power of the State under the 1906 law while the alternate practitioners were hampered and huassed at every turn."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"It was not medicine that failed.

An immediate research eITort niust be undertaken to develop drugs to deal with this emerging threat to public health. . While it is unlikely anyone.; 0.e. would catch TB from such casual - contact as sitting at at1 adjacent. table in a restaurant or at an adjoining desk at work, TB is spread by prolonged persorial contact, most typically among families livit~g in close quarters, according to medical experts. 'Most of the cases of drug- resistant bacterium have been found in New York City, where the TB epidemic has combined , with epidemics of HlV infection, intravet~ous drug abuse and hornelessness to create cohditiotis uiider which the disease thrives. ,While Seattle so far has seen only a handful of tuberculosis caqes resistant to standard drug treatment, the deadly strain has surfaced in 13 states and . generally \"tuberculosis is out of control in this couritry,\" according to Dr. Dixie Snider, the chief expert ori tuberculosis at the federal Centers of Disease Control. \"I think it's on~irious,\" adds Dr. Charles ~olan, director of Tuberculosis Control Programs for the Seattle-King County Department of Health. In Seattle-King County, the rate of TB has risen from an all- time low in 1984 of 84 cases to 107 now. From 5 to 10 percent of those cases are in people with HIV infection. another 10 to 15 percent in drug abusers, 25 percent in either the homeless or medically underserved and 50 percent in immigrant populations, according to Nolan. Because it was wrongly assumed that the U.S. had the disease permanently under control, no new TB drugs have been bro ght to market in 22 years an4 the tuberculosis public health programs have been all but dismantled. \"It's almost criminal that this has been allowed to happen,\" says Nolan, who sits on a national council whose charge is to eliminate TB in this country. Meanwhile. 8 million new cases of TB occur annually worldwide, and a staggering 3 n~illion people die from it each year. It seems unlikely then, given modern international interdependency, that TB will be eliminated in the United States unless it's also eliminated in the rest of the global village."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Super-TB - bug- .. . -. . .- - spreads in News Services / - 9 >.

A team headed by Dr. Shiu-Lok Iiu of Bristol-Myem Squibb Phar- maceutical Research Institute in Seattle vaccinated four macaque monkeys against the simian m- munodeficiency virus, which is re- lated to HIV, the human AIDS vi- NS. The scientists report on their study in the forthcoming issue of Science, the weekly jounral of the American Association for the Ad- vancement of Science. Dr. Dani Bolognesi of the Center for AIDS Research at Duke Uni-. versity, which was inwlved in the study, said it was \"cleady support- ing evidence\" that such a method conid achieve success against the HIV virus in humans. Monkeys had been immunized against SIV before, but it was done with vaccines made from inacti- vated whole viruses. The authors said use of whole inactivated HIV vaccines in humans presents problems because of safety ques- tions. Consequently, most efforts to develop an HIV vaccine have con- centrated on strategies similar to the one used on the monkeys. In tests now being conducted on human volunteers, Bolopesi said, \"there are encouraging signs that this protocol is inducing good re- sponses in people.\"- - -"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 LlPID MEMBRANE Two diagrams from Or.

While theoretically pos- sible, no cases or transmiasion from tears or saliva have yet been discovered. The most efficient methods of HIV transmission are as follows 1) The use of contaminated blood or blood products for transhrsion or i-on. Befom 1985 when new blood screening procedures were installed, an estimated 12.000 persons received HXV tainted blood.

According to Dr. James Chin who tracks and forecasts the size and direc- tion dthe AIDS epidemic for the WHO. the US and Europe may see the growth rate of new AIDS cases begin to level off in 1995. \"By the mid 1990s annual new cases of AIDS will peak in the developed world, but not until 2000 or beyond in Asia and Africa.\" At fvst glance the statistics for cur- rent and future AIDS cases seem over- whelming. Hawever one must keep in mind that despite the publicity given to AIDS it is by no means the world's worst killer. Consider the follcrwing: Since the outbreak of AIDS in 1981, close to tmthirds of thw diagnosed with AIDS in the US. some 126,000 people, have died.

But it may provide a new way to safeguard transplanted organs and act as a model for anticancer drugs - Paul Waring and Arno Miillbacher A FEW curious natural compounds have revolutionised medicine in theZOthcentury. Theseare part of a huge range of chemicals that fungi pro- dua when they have too few nutrients. Their value to the fungi is uncertain (see New Scientist. 7 October 1989) but. fortunately for us. they turn out to have dramatically beneficial medicinal effects. The best known is penicillin. Now another \"useless\" fungal chemical has come to light which may becbme an equally important drug. These fungal chemicals arc called \"secondary metabolites\". to distinguish them from primary metabolites-wm- pounds that fungi produce as part of the biochemical processes that keep them alive. No one knows quite what secondary metabolites do for fungi. but they may inhibit the growth of other organisms wmpeting with the fungi for scarce faod-a sort of fungal chemical warfare. Not surprisingly. then. these chemicals often have anti- bacterial or antifungal properties. Their chemical structures vary widely. ranging from palytoxin. an extremely complex metabolite isolated fromsome sponges. to simple organic acids like oxolic acid produced by some aspcrgillus fungi. The most famous secondary fungal metabolite, penicillin. was discovered accidentally in 1928 in the mould PeniciUiwn notalum by Alexander Fleming and developed- by Howard &dy brl goad: krpcrgillus furniguus produces a tom that II!~ rival penicillin Florey.

Could gliotoxin do the trick? We tested this possibility by treating the thyroid glands of mice with gliotoxin and then transplanting them into mice of a different strain. The tissue lost its ability to stimulate an immune response in the host mice, even though it retained all its other physiological functions. So it seems that gliotoxin or some related compound might prove useful for treating organs and tissue for short periods before transplantation. This would leave the immune system of the person receiving the transplant working normally so that it could then cope with any com- mon infection. Once we have studied the natural compounds in detail, it should be possible to design synthetic ones that are even more selective.

It seems that. in mice at least. the mature white blood cells that bring about GvH disease are more sensitive to gliotoxin than are the immature ones. David Haig at the Moredun Research Institute in Edinburgh did similar work on sheep earlier this year. He found a similar difference in sensitivity to gliotoxin between mature and immature cells of the bone marrow. It began to look as though gliotoxin would also be useful in bone marrow transplantation in people. if human cells behave in the same way. In 1987 we decided to study the mechanism by which gliotoxin modifies the function of immune cells such as macrophages and T cells. T cells are an important set of immune cells. They include cytotoxic cells that can kill other cells in the body, such as tumour cells. or those infected with a virus. We made isomers of gliotoxin-like molecules and examined how they behaved towards cells of the immune system. Isomers are compounds that have similar structures but differ in the conformation or configuration of groups in the molecule. The use of isomers or analogues can be a powerful technique in understanding what features of the molecule are important in its biological activity.

Observers often seem unable to decide which of these descriptions fits the inter- national pharmaceuticals industry. The sector spends prodigious sums of money unravelling highly complex aspects of chemistry and biology in the cause of making people healthier. Its products have undoubtedly played a b~g part over the past half century in increasing the life expectancy of the average person, in the developed world at least. Yet at the same time a question mark remains in many people's minds regarding the-activities of the international drugs companies, the bieeest of which include Merck in the US. Britain's Glaxo. ~oecst in West Germany and ~witzerland's ciba-C3eigy: These firms fight over the world drugs market totalling some f70 billion a year, most of which is accounted for by sales in Western Europe, North America and Japan. In the battle for the top places in the industry, hard science plays an important part. So do razor-sharp accounting practices, sophisticated selling techhiquesand much corporate wheeler-dealing. The corporate manoeuvring involves multi- billion-dollar takeover battles and countless small and some- times temporary liaisons between the leading pharmaceutical players that sometimesend in tears. It is not surprising that the public image of the drugs business emphasises not so much the toiling whitecoated scientist as the ultra-slick salesman extolling the virtues of the latest \"Whiuo Drug\". The notion held by many that drug com anies are somehow cashing in on people's illnesses is rein /' orced by the large profits that many of the leaders in the industry make. Glaxo. Britain's biggest drugs company, with its annual sales of about £2-5 billion, is a good example. In recent years it has been churning out pretax profits totalling abut 40 per cent of annual saleofar above the rate for most other industrial groups in areas such as engineering and electronics. The drugs groups themselves often add to the climate of suspicion by revealing few of their activities to the public. partly because of a fear of giving away secrets to rivals. The commonly held views about the industry strike many inside it as unfair. 'They point out that the sector io particularly in the US and much of Western Europe-a highly successful business and a strong export earner. It has an especially good record in West Germany. Switzerland and Britain in turning scientific ideas into useful products. In Britain the drugs sector, with annual sales of about f4 billion and a balance of payments surplus of fW million, is one of the country's few strong science-based businesses. And pharmaceuticals is one science and technology based industry where the West has had a much stronger record, so far at least, than Japan. Of the world's top'll drugs firms, only one. Takeda. is Japanese (see Table). The drugs companies are directly concerned with something of burning interest to almost every individual-si~feguarding and improving human health-and this is emphasised in how they present themselves publicly. As well as this, a strong strand of public responsibility runs through many of the scientists and managers in the industry. The drive toshed light on health problems can also be secn in the sector's spending on research and development (R&D). Pharrnaccuticals compa- nies commonly spend between 10 and 15 per cent of their annual sales on R&D, far more than the average in other so- called high-tech industries such as telecommunications and electronics. In many countries, the drugs sector is among the biggest civilian employers of scientists and technicians. This can be seen especially in the case of Britain, whose pharmaceuticals industry employs 15 000 R&D workers. The British drugs sector's sales account for only about 2 per cent of Britain's gross domestic product. In R&D terms, however, the sector is far more important: it spends £700 million a year, nearly a tenth of Britain's total R&D expenditure counting both government and industry programmes."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Throughout the world drugs business. there is some pride in the purely scientific achievements of the past 30 years. Examples include heart drugs such as beta blockers, which pe~mit patients to \"manage\" cardiovascular disease with m~nimal disruption to their lives. Another is the anti-AIDS formulation Retrovir. made by the British drug company Wellcome and without which the lot of the average AIDS sufferer would be even more depressing than it is now. Many within the industry cannot understand the opposition that its sector tends to stir up among outsiders. \"We et criticised by B just about everyone,\" says one British rugs company executive. \"No one seems to understand how difficult life would be without us.\" In the drugs industry, though, social concern is only art of the story. Thesector is highly corn titive. obsessed by tRe fact r that the biggest company-Merc of the US-has just 4 per cent of total world sales. In other sectors such as branches of electronics and engineering the dominant firm might expect to have a market share twice as high. That puts a lot of pressure on the top 100 or so drugs companies, which between them have about 80 per cent of world pharmaceuticals sales, to scrap for just a few rcentage points of extra market share in the line-up behin cr Merck. This is one reason for the industry's highly sophisticated- some say ruthless-marketing techniques and the relentless drive to increase turnover and profits. One manifestation of this push has been the rash of mergers in recent months. mainly involving American companies that see joining up with rivals as the most promising way to close the ap with Merck. Another goal is to provide what they see as tt economies of scale in both research and marketing which are re uired for the increasin ly tough business battles of the 1990s.he most rominent o f these mergers have been the teaming up of the LS*~ SmithKline Beckman with Beecham of Britain and"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"b pressures suffered by people in drugs companies as a result of the financial world's fierce interest in their activities.

Other factors which cause people &the busin& a great deal of worry-and can affect the way the industry is viewed by the outside world-include governments, ethics and the way the companies run their R&D. In many deveio d countries (especially in Europe) the state foots the bill eit Ir er directly or indirectly for the lion's share of pharmaceutical spending. They are thus highly important customers for drug firms. Secondly, government bodies are vitally involved in testing new formulations for safety. The result is that the drugs industry can easily be hit by cost-cutting drives by its main state-owned customers; it is also hemmed in by the safety regulations. Over the past 10 years the safety rules have become more onerous, driven by the public scares over \"ro ue\" drugs such as thalidomide or Opren. That has pushed u ABD costs; only about a quarter of the drug industry's R~B bill is accounted for by ure research, with the rest covering the development needelto drive new products through the regulations. It has also lengthened the tlme it takes to get a new formulation on sale. While in the 1960s government approval for a new drug mi ht take just a few years the figure is now nearer 12 years. his link with government departments can cramp a company's entre reneurial style. Some pharmaceuticals researchers comp I' ain about the mountains of scientific data which they have tosubmit to regulatory authorities before new products can go on sale. The connectlons, however, can also work in a company's interests. This applies to the interactions between a medicines company and the state health agencies which are key purchasers of its products. In some countries- France is a good example-a pharmaceuticals company can expect favours from the government on pricing issues if it proves itself a \"good citizen\". Thus if the company agrees to Invest in a new factory or a research establishment, so providing jobs, it may be allowed to char e more for its latest B product. Such negotiations, in Western urope at least, are often hi hly confidential. There is some hope, however, that some of these deals may be opened out to greater public scrutinv. That could result from new rules that the European Commission is drawing up to govern drug prices throughout the Eurooean Communitv in the run-UD to the Dianned ~ - -- abolition bf trade restrictidns after 1992. a The ethics of marketing The drugs industry is known for its highly creative sales and marketing techniques generally aimed at doctors. Some 80 per cent of the industry's sales come from prescriptions while the rest comes from products bought directly over-the-counter. The big companiis employ a range of de4ces to win over the doctors. They use computers to draw up lists of \"innovatory\" doctors who- stand a ood chance of being persuaded to prescribe specific new f ormulations, which command a high rice and good profit margins. The sales force also tries to [oms in on \"opinion leaders9* in the medical community. In Britain, the companies place a special emphasis on winning the trust of hard-pressed general practitioners. These doctors, with only patients to talk to for most of the day, often find themselves isolated from scientifically literate people. So by engaging in scientific chit-chat and swapping technical literature the drug rep can win the doctor's trust. That may lead to more prescriptions for the company. This effort at cementing ties with doctors is highly expensive. To cover the whole of Europe or the US, a big drugscompany might need to employ between 1000 and 2000 sales people or \"detail men\" wbo spend all their time talking to doctors or other medical people. One result is that sometimes the sales pressures smack of what might delicately be called over-exhortation. Cases in point are the stories of pharmaceuticals firms inviting doctors to elaborate, all-expenses-paid \"sales con- ferences\" to receive plugs for the latest wonder drugs. The drugs industry also hands out a range of free gifts-anything from note pads to computers-to physicians as pan of the drive to build up a good relationship. Such links between sales rep and customer are common enou h in many other industries. However, when it comes to head care, high-pressure sales techniques and free ifts have led to some sweeping criticisms of the industry. 'lPhe drugs business is like a jungle,\" says one prominent opponent of the sector. In the wake of this kind of comment, in some countries, Britain included, trade associations acting for the drug sector have drawn up codes of practice designed to curb the enthusiasms of the more imaginative reps. Every now and again, however, excesses are brought to hght. R&D management The new drugs which come on to the market emerge after up to 10 years of carefully planned development. Their gestation is in many ways as complex as big technology projects such as space shuttles or nuclear power stations. The programme for a typical new drug starts with pure research where a scientist m~ght try a new approach to altering the mechanisms connected with. say, heart disease. After toxicity and animal tests, it ends with massive trials on possibly tens of thousands of patients to work out the details of the drug's effectiveness. Only after this will arelevant national health authority, such as the Food and Drug Administration in the US or the Department of Health in Britain, license the companies to sell the drugs. Thergare some favourable trends in R&D. New techniques in areas such as biotechnoloev and comDuter modelline of protein structures should hgip the industry to find -the mechanisms behind important illnesses such as cancer and brain disorders. From this should follow, in theory, new money-spinning roducts. The downside, however, is the increasing cost o P development, mainly due to the lengthier and more complex tests that governments require. The result is that drugs companies are having to run faster to stand still. American pharmaceuticals companies now spend some $5 billion a year on R&D, four times as much as a decade ago, but the rate of introduction of new products has remained constant. In the past few years, many big harmaceuticals firms are spending as much as between 10 and $0perhnt more on R&D a year-at a time when overall sales are growing by no more than 5 per cent a year in many countries. The pace at which drugs companies pour resources into R&D is a source of fascination, and worry, both inside and outside the industry. Merck. for instance, spends $700 million a year on research and development and is alegend for the way in which it has been able to translate this into dozens of hieh- selling products.

Many, however, doubt that all the other top-flight pharmaceuticalscompaniescan match Merck's rate of Innova- tion. \"They can't all carry on spending this amount of money on research.\" says one drugs industry observer. \"Something is going to have to give.\" Doubts. for instance. have been expressed about Glaxo's scheme to build a £500 million research centre in Stevena e. Hertfordshire, to act as a new i focus for its R&D efforts. T e centre, due to be finished by the mid-1990s. may have to be scaled back, according to some in the industry. Apart from more mergers, in which rival groups assemble their research programmes with a certain amount of cost cuttin the answer to the rising research bills may well be more gi ~nely honed mana ement techniques within R&D. A related problem with R&% is that few can agree on just how innovatlve the drugs industry reall is. Those inside the i business point to breakthroughs suc as Zantac, which has revolutionised the treatment of ulcers, and heart drugs such as Merck's Vasotec, which has made the lives of people suffering from cardiovascular disease far more bearable. Critics, however, maintain that the enuine leaps are d relatively rare. Many of the 50 or so new rug which appear on sale each vear are. according to this view. \"me-too\" products, siighGy im roved versiok of other medicines that a K rival In the bus~ness as already produced. Some backing for this view comes in a recent r-e*rt from Scrip, a specialist newsletter for the pharmaceuticals business, which says that of the 53 new medicines introduced worldwide in 1988, only four can be regarded as \"breakthrough products\" in the sense of benefiting patients with hitherto untreatable diseases. More ammunition for the critics came in recent findings from a US Senate inquiry. This said that of the 348 new drugs introduced by big American manufacturers between 1981 and 1988, 292 made \"little or no\" contribution to existing drug therapies. Only 12 were rated as showing an important therapeutic gain. This hardly inspires confidence in the innovatory qualities of the industry as a whole. The me-too products may also, so this argument goes, clog up regulatory agencies, cutting the time given to testing of more important dmgs. Such attitudes are rejected by people within the industry. \"People talk about copycat products.\" says one penon dose to the drugs business. \"But what they don't reaii is that they might improve, even by an incremental amount, on what has gone before. Also don't forget that every This is a major reason for the relentless efforts put into boosting revenues in the first few years after a medicine is put on the market. \"In pharmaceuticals. much more so than in other industries, it's no good waiting a few years to get your earnings from a new product\". explains a former chief executive at a leading drugs company. \"By then it will he too late because your competitors will be ready to move in.\" This is why drugs company chiefs around the world spend so much time attempting to persuade legislators to give thcm a better deal over patents. A favourite idea is to change the patent laws with respect to drugs so that a new drug is protected for a set period-say 16 years-after the date it is first sold rather than from the time of the patent's issue. The industry has won some relief in the US. where a patent's term can be extended if a new drug has taken a particularly long time to develop. Com anies now want to see similar measures enacted within the E uropean Commu- nity. \"It is the one issue that unites us all.\" says one European executive. In return some in the industry argue, it might be less secretive. less feverish in sales and marketing and possibly spend more of its research cash on the genuine breakthroughs rather than the me-too products. Whether such a state of affairs comes about will be one of the more interesting industrial policy questions of the 1990s. 0 patient who uses a drug is different. Even though there are dozens of heart drugs on the market, what works for one non may be totally unsuitable for another. It is only by cuing lots of 'me-too* products that a doctor can experiment to find out what is best for his patient.\" When bracketed with drugs companies. finance can pro- voke either disquiet on the part of the industry's critics or subdued admiration from accountants. The companies are adept at presenting profitability in the right light. In many countries. the image of a drugs company may be harmed if it looks as though it has been making too much money. Some AIDS activists. for example, have criticised the Wellcome's subsidiary in the US for charging some $8000 for a year's supply of Retrovir. And in some countries--Britain is the best example-the prices that companies are allowed to charge are directly linked to rofits. Here again it may suit a company to minimlse the pro ? it which it shows in its accounts. Financial engineering The industry can also manipulate the profits which it shows in soecificcountries. It cando this both asa result of astructure - - . - - - . . -. - of ihe business and because of the way medicinces are made. Many of the biggest dmgs grou are part of large multi- national chemical companies. &a-~elgy and Sandoz of Switzerland,.ICI of Britain, Bayer and Hoechst of Germany, the US'S Merrell Dow and France's Rh6ne-Poulenc all fit into this category. Many of the chemicals needed to make a drug are quite cheap apart from a few key substances which are at the centre of the production chain. These substances, called intermediates, are commonly manufactured by subsidiaries of the same company that sells the finished drug. A drugs company looking to depress its profit in one country can arrange to buy its intermediate from a subsidiary in another country at particularly high prices. Patent law is among the most contentious subjects within the industry. More than virtually every other kind of science- based product, drug depend on strong patent protection if they are to produce large sales for their makers. A producer can claim a patent on the basis of the drug's chemical formula. The problem is that patents normally last for about 20 years. As it generally takes 10 to 12 years to push a drug through the R&D programme, many roducts have only 8 to 10 years of patent protection after t g e formulation goes on sale. me company then has to fight to make a profit before the patent runs out and competitors can copy it."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 In the al~senre of laws. patient conflden cludes about a.m. or roughly half of dl Data Tap tiamy 1s lrlore prous than ever brlore. druptores.

These include a wide variety of bac- terial infections as well as diseases caused by viruses, pathogenic protozoa, and Rickettsia. The latter will be discussed in later chap ten, and many of the bacterial infections will be described here. -4mong the bacterial diseases are bovine tuberculosis (see Chapter LXII), septic sore throat (see Chapter LT'III), anthrax, glanders, contagious abortion of cattle. Jlalta fever. s>mptornatic anthrax, malignant edema, and tularemia. Diseases of animals may be con- tracted by man in Merent n-ays: 1. Through an insect vector, such as lice, fleas, or ticks. 2. Through eating iood or drinking milk coming irom diseased animals. 3. Through direct contact with animals that are infected. Veterinary medicine and bacteriology, then, are closely interrelated subjects and an integral part of medical bacteriology. MYCOBACTERmM PARATUBERCULOSIS Mycobacterium Paratuberculosis (Bacillus of Johne's Disease). 1. Group--acid-fast. 2. Family-Jlycobacteriaceae. 3. Habitat- intestinal mucosa; cause of Johne's disease, a chronic diarrhea of cattle. 4. Discoverers -Johne and Frothingham, in 1895. Morphological Characteristics. 1. Form-more or less pleomorphic rods. 2. Cell groupings--occurs singly, in pairs, or in dumps. 3. Sie4.5~ broad and 1 to 2p long. 4. Staining properties- @ usually stains uniformly, but the longer FIG. 37. Mycobacknknum forms show alternate stained and unstained +rolvbcrC in lymph. segments. With Ziehl-Neelsen stain, it is acid-fast. Ito is not stained by ordinary aniline dyes. 5. Gram- pasitive. 6. Nonmotile. 7. Nonsporing. Cultural Characteristics. The organism has been ficult to culti- vate and grows poorly on agar, potato, and gelatin stabs. Growth is more profuse if killed cultures of other acid-fast bacteria are added. 1. Glycerol broth-grows in clumps, with sediment in bottom of tube and clear liquid above; adapted cultures may produce a thin surface pellicle which becomes wrinkled and thickened. 2. Dorset's glycerol egg medium-after several days of incubation, vej minute, slow- growing, dry, ,gayish-wbite colonies appear; as colony grows older and larger, it becomes winkled. Physiological Characteristics. 1. Optimum temperature, 39' C.; minimum, 27' C.; maximum, 43' C. 2. Gron-s best aerobically; slight growth under anaerobic conditions. 3. Resistancethe organ- isms mill resist desiccation. Direct sunlight kills them in a few minutes. Disinfectants are effective in the usual dilutions, if the organism is free from albuminous matter. Pathogenicity. The disease affects cattle and, less frequently, sheep and deer, folloning ingestion of fodder that has been soiled with feces of infected animals. The disease is a chronic enteritis characterized by gradual emaciation, running a long course extending from a period of several months, hally ending in death in practically"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"all cases. The incubation period may run up to 18 months. Aside from evidence of emaciation, the post-mortem examination reveals no specific lesions apart from those in the intestinal tract. The intestinal mucosa, particularly that of the small intestine, is greatly thickened and presents a marked, n*led, or corrugated appearance. On the surface of the corrugations there are hemorrhages, and occa- sionally smaU nodules are observed. The bacilli are usually found in the mesenteric glands which are enlarged, edematous, and pig mented. Diagnosis. 1. A preparation, johnin, which is similar to tuber- culin, has been made by growing Johne's bacillus in a special broth medium containing dead Mycobactaium phlei bacilli. When 0.2 ml of johnin is injected intradennally into an animal and 0.2 ml. is injected 48 hours later into the site of the previous injection, a positive reaction of muse swe,lling occurs in infected animalr. The injection of avian tuberculin in large amounts may produce a reaction in animal!: with Johne's disease. The test with johnin is believed to be specific and of diagnostic value. 2. The organism may be cultivated on glycerin egg medium con- taining dead tubercle bacilli, by inoculating the medium with intestinal mum washed in 20% antiformin. . 3. A smear may be prepared using a piece of the intestid mum and staining by the Ziehl-Neeken method. Production of Disease. Although attempts have been made to infect guinea pigs, zats, and mice, it is considered that the typical disease has not yet been transferred to animals No case of human infection has been recorded. Prophylaxis. No method of prophylaxis has been devised. Con- trol of the disease is based on the destruction of infected animals. Related Organisms. 1. Mycobactcrium urium, 2.

Pathogenicity. The natural disease afTects herbivora, My sheep and cattle, in which the mortality may be as high as 80% The disease generally involves septicemia. In acute cases, the animd may appear in customary health until a short time before death, when convulsions, rigors, and elevation of tempera- occur, with blood extravasations from the nose, mouth, and rectum. Tbe most marked post-mortem hding is enlargement of the spleen. This organ be- comes pliable and soft and contains enormous numbers of bacilli. Man may be infected by the cutaneous, respiratory, or intestinal routes. 1. Cufuncous Anthrax. This form occurs most frequently upon the hands and forearms, especially of persons working with livestock. It is referred to as malignunt pustule and is characterized by the appear- ance of a small furuncle within 12 to 21 hours after infection. The lesion becomes vesicular, rith a seropurulent exudate, and then under- goes necrosis. This may be excised and the patient will, in general, recover, or local gangrene may set in followed by a systemic infection anddeathin5 to6days. 2. Pulmmt4ry Anthrax (Woobwtn's Disease). This form is con- tracted by inhalation or by swallowing spores of BaciUus anthr4ci.s. The disease is characterized by many of the symptoms of pneumonia and often passes into a fatal septicemia. Before death the organism may be isolated in the sputum. 3. Intertinul Anthrax. This form is rare and is contracted by ingestion of uncooked meat of infected animals. There is a seven enteritis with bloody stools and prostration, with death generally. The presence of bacilli in the feces is indicative of this type of anthrax infection. Serologicd Reactions. Agglutination and precipitation tests have been used to merentiate Bdus anthrcis from other members of the aerobic spore-bearing group. The agglutinins produced in rc- sponse to injections of the organism have given cross reactions with"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"other members of the group. The performance of the agglutination test with BaciUas anlhrucis is hampered by the Wcuity in obtaining homogeneous susp&sions. The formation of precipitins by injection of Barillus anthrucis into animals has been utilized by Ascoli in a precipitin test for the diagnosis of anthrax in animals dead of the disease or to detect con- tamination of hides. The test is carried out as follows: 1. .4n extract of a d piece of the spleen or otha tissue of a dead animal is made by Wig it in saline, cooling, and filtering. 2. The cxtmct is layered on high-titer antixnun. . 3. The formation of a zone of precipitate at the junction of the er~na ad antiserum indicates a positive reaction. 4. The serum for the tat should be prepared by immuuizing rabbits with a suitable strain of encapsulated anthrax bacilli. Diagnosis. 1. CoUcction of Muhial. This will depend upon the type of infection-pus or fluid from local lesions in malignant pustule, blood in the systemic stage of tfie disease, sputum in the pul- monary infection, feces in the intestinal infection, or the spinal fluid in the occasional meningeal infections. 2. Smcars are made and examined for dmacterktic large, Gram- positive, encapsulated organism Blood examinations may give negative dts, for the bacilli are not present in the blood in large numbers until shortly before death. 3. Cultures are made by inoculating some of the material in broth and on agar plates and incubating. 4. Anid inoculufimrs are made as cobtory tests. The subcutaneous injection of white mice, guinea pigs, or rabbits with a small portion of broth culture, or a suspension made of the growth on nutrient agar, results in the death of the animal in 12 hours to 2 or 3 days with a fatal kepticcmia, if anthnu bacilli are present The material isolated from the lesion may be directly inoculated into nnimnlr. Pmphyhxis and Therapy. General prophylaxis consists chidy in destruction of infected animals, burying of cadavas, and the dish- fection of stables. 1. Active Immi(nizdimr of Anid. The method of Pasteur is still used today. It consists of the subcutaneous inoculation of atten- uated cultures of Bacillus anthrucis. Two vaccines am injected; the ht is a culture which has lost its vimlena for guinea pigs and rabbits, and is potent only for mice; the second is a culture whicb is still potent for mice and guinea pigs, but is harmless for rabbits. The second vac&e is given 12 days after the first. Various modifications of this method are in use, but it is still essentially the Same. 2. Serum Therapy. Lnoculation with anti-anthrax serum confers some degree of immunity aad has been used for prophye and therapy. 3. Arsenicals are frequently used in conjunction with antiserum therapy.

The organism is responsible for a disease occur- ring naturally in rodents, especially the rabbit The disease in human beings is known as tularemia. It is transmitted by the handling of infected animals. Infection may take place by inoculation, through the unbroken skin, through the conjunctiva, and possibly by inhala- tion, and alx, by intermediary infected blood-sucking insects-&e~ (Chrysops discdis), ticks (Dcrmcenh adcrsoni), lice, fleas, and others. In animals the disease resembles plague and is fatal, but in man it is milder and rarely fatal, although of long duration. In man it is of four clinical types: 1. Clceroglandular type in which the primary lesion is a papule of the skin that later becomes an ulcer and is accompanied by enlarge- ment of the regional lymph glands. 2. Oculoglanddar type in which the primary lesion is a conjunc- ti\\-itis with an accompanying enlargement qf the regional lymph glands. 3. Gladular type in which there is no primary lesion at the site of section, but there is enlargement of the regional lymph glands. 4. Typhoid type in which there is neither a primary lesion nor glandular enlargement. Serological Reactions. In response to infection with tularemia, agglutinins and complement-king antibodies are developed. The agglutination test is a valuable diagnostic procedure in tularemia. Since there is some cross agglutination between antiserum prepared agLinst Patetcrella tularensis and Brucella mclitensis and Brucella"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"dortw, it is necessary to Merentiate the causative agent of tularemia from these organisms. This is determined from the fact that Brircclla mdikntis and Brucella abortus agdutinate Pastcurella tular-s antiserum to about one-fourth to one-sixth its titer, which may nm up to as high as 1 : 2560 or 1 : 5120 against Paskure&% tularmsis. The members of the Brucella group, however, do not absorb agglutinins for Pastcurella tularenris. Therefore, a reciprocal absorption test is used to ditlerentiate between them. Diagnosis. 1. Cultures are made by inoculating the infected material into blood glucose cystine agar, incubating at 37' C. for from 3 days to 3 weeks, and dig for characteristic colonies. 2. Animal Itwcu&tions. The suspected material is inoculated into guinea pigs by rubbing some of the material into the shaven abraded skin or by inoculating it subcutaneously. If PaskrueUu tdw& is present, the animllr will die in 5 to 10 &ys with charac- teristic lesions of cervical, axillary, or inguinal buboes, enlarged glands, enlarged spleen, and a granulated liver. 3. AggIutitu~tion Test. A&utinins aplm in the blood of cases with tularemia after the kt week of the disease. The blood is collected at this period and serum diluti011~ of 1 : 10 to 1.'. 320 or higher are prepared and tested in 0.5 ml. amounts ;rgainst 0.5 ml. of a saline suspension of PaskruCU4 tularcnsis.

The injection of the tosin subcutaneously or intramuscu- larly does not always produce a fatal reaction but produces local necrosis. The toxin is prepared in a 0.2% glucose broth containing 10% horse serum, the broth being incubated for 24 to 48 hours after inoculation. Clostridium septuum also produces a hemolysin which causes hemolysis of human and sheep red blood cells. Serological Reactions. Antitoxins against Clostridium septicurn are prepared by injecting horses or sheep with the toxin. They are spdc against the organism and do not protect against Clostridiurn nooyi. By means of agglutination tests, strains of Cbstridium septG cum have been divided into four antigenic groups. There is no cross agglutination between Clostridium septicum antiserum and Cbshidiurn chauvoei. Pathogenicity. Clostridium septicurn is the cause of malignant edema, a fatal infection of horses following surgical or traumatic wounds, and occasionally in cattle and sheep. Pathologically, the disease is characterized by edematous, emphysematous swellings, and ifitration of cellular tissues, in which lesions the bacillus is found. In man the virulence of the organism varies greatly with the strain. Some types are almost.or completely nonpathogenic. In infections of man it is important as a cause of gas gangrene, although it is much less commonly encountered than is Cbsthidium perfringens. The form of gas gangrene due to thii organism diflers somewhat from that due to Clostridium perfringtirs in that edema with blood-stained fluid is more marked, and necrosis and gas production are less violent. Cbstridium septkum is rarely found alone, but pure infections have been recorded. Experimentally, the organism is pathogenic for guinea pig, mice, rabbits, and pigeons. An intramuscular injection of 0.01 to 0.5 d. of a 24 hour culture into guinea pigs produces death in 12 to 24 hours, with edemii and gas production. Prophylaxis. I'accination, using attenuated spores, has proved dective in the hands of some workers. Various investigaton have produced antitoxic and antibacterial sera for which both prophylactic and therapeutic value are claimed in the early stages of gas gangrene. -."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Related Organisms.

There are two organisms which ha\\-e been designated in the literature as BruceUII abortus. The porcine iariety is now called Brucella suis. The bovine variety hasmtained the name Brucella abortus. The two organisms are simiiar in most respects, ex- cept that Brucclla suis requires no added COt for its growth. Both the"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"porcine and bovine types can cause undulant fever in man after an in- cubation period of 1 week to several monh. There is, typically, a long continued pyrexia, often with remissions, which may be accompanied by joint pains, skin rashes, sweating at night, and other symptoms. Whether or not these organisms are related to cases of miscarriage in human beings has not been determined. BncceUa abortus has been iso- lated in several instanceswhere the diagnosis of endocarditis was made. Epidemiology. Bruce& abortus may appear in the milk of cows that have aborted and may aka appear in the milk of cows that are carriers but have suffered no abortion themselves. Human infection may result from attending to infected animals or, at other times, from handling the flesh or drinking raw milk of infected cows. Serological Reactions. Agglutinins and complement-fixing anti- bodies are produced in response to infection with Brucclla abortus, and a diagnosis of the disease is often made by ascvtaining the aggluti- nation titer of a patient's serum. The finding of an agglutinating titer of 1: 80 or 1: 100 is usually considered signihnt. This is not pathognomonic, however, since titers of this magnitude or higher are often encountered in healthy human beings. Therefore, when blood cultures are negative (the disease is one in which septicemia is often present), a positive diagnoe should not be made unless the serum agglutinin titer is at least 1 :500. Immunity and Prophylaxis. Calves, nonpregnant cows, and human bein& seem to have a high natural resktancc. One attack of undulant fever protects against a second attack. It is acult to ascertain a cure, since remissions occur. Vaccines have been used in cattle, and the results thus far have been inconclusive. Experiments on active immunization of human beii have also given questionable results. Thr: use of immune serum and brucellin has been advocated by many workers, but here again most of the reports have been uncon- vincing or negative. Recently, cures have been reported in cases treated with sulfanilamide, aureomych, and chloromycetin. B. BruceUa Melitensis (Bacillus Melitensis, Alcaligenes Meli- tensis). 1. Group-Brucek 2.

By agglutination two antigenic groups an distinguishable, the melitensis (smooth) type and the parameli-"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"tensis (rough) type. Carriers of the disease and those who have re- covered have agglutinins and complement-a antibodies in their sera. Agglutinin absorption tests are necessary for diagnosis since such antisera will moss agglutinate with Brucellu abortus and Brucda suis. Agglutinins occur in serum about the tenth or twelfth day of the fever. The titer rises to 1 : 100 and 1 : 300. Complement fixation is positive in nearly all cases during the fever. Pathogenicitp. Malta fever is spread to man by means of goat's milk infected with Brucdla melit&. The disease in both goats and man is a bacteremia, and the etiologic agent may be recovered from the blood. In goats, the most obvious clinical symptom is abortion, although this need not occur. Goats may have the disease with the organism circulating in the blood and Wig escreted in the urine, without the animal's showing signs of the infection. Many goats, however, show evidences of infection by losing weight, developing a cough, and in some instances developing mastitis and arthritis. In man a blood culture is positive in about 80% of the cases after the second day of the disease, which may prevail in the bacteremia form for several months. Control of Undulant Fever and Malta Fever. The pnve6tion of the spread of these infections depends upon the following measures: 1. Eradication of the diseases in herds of cattle, goats, and swine. 2. Proper precautions in handling infected animals, and in so far as possible avoiding contact with them. 3. Pasteurization of milk and milk products. 4 Disinfection and proper disposal of urine and feces of patients. 5. Treatment with the antibiotics aureomycin and chloromycetin in human Wigs.

They are intracellular parasites whose exact nature is un- lir! mn, but they are generally considered intermediate between the baireria and filterable viruses. They resemble bacteria in shape and may be cocci, diplococci, or short bacilli They are Gram-negative, nonmotile, nonsporing, nonencapsulated, probably all n.:.iiIterable, and are @cult to stain with ordinary aniline dyes. The Giemsa stain is good for demonstrating these bodies. It is acult to cultivate the rickettsia bodies, and therefore diagnosis is hampered. The diseases caused by rickettsia bodies are all vectored by intmnediate insect hosts of the phylum Arthropoda, such as ticks and lice; The rickettsia bodies are 0.3-0.5~ or more in length and about 0.3~ in diameter. They have electrophoretic characteristics similar to the bacteria. They are thennolabile and Wed by dehydration or chemical anti- septics. Electron microscopic examination of the rickettsia bodies reveals a homogeneous or slightly granular internal structure closely resembling that of the bacteria. Like the vi., the pathogenic Rickettsiae are true parasites and can be cultivated in the intestines of rats, ticks, and lice, in tissue cultures, and in the membranes of chick embryos. The natural habitat of the Rickettsiae appears to be the cells lining the intestine and other tissues of insects, both blood-sucking and non-blood-sucking. Diseases.

The organisms occur in the cytoplasm but not the nucleus of invaded cells. Blood of the patient is infectious, but organisms have not been seen in the blood. Weit-Felix Reaction. The serum of persons with typhus fever contains agglutinins against certain Proteus strains, the most famous of which is Proteus 0x19, isolated by Weil and Felix from the urine of typhus fever patients. The agglutination reaction of the senun in dilutions of 1:50 to 1:50,000 is diagnostic for typhus fwer. The Proteus X strains are not related to typhus fwer in an etiologic sense, for they are rarely found in cases of the disease and experimental inocu- lation of these organisms does not produce the disease. Protets strains do not immunize against Rickettsiae, nor does recovery from rickettsia1 infection immunize against experimental Proteus infection. Zinsser and associates have suggested that the rickettsia bodies and certain Proteus strains contain a common antigen component Prophylaxis. The prevention of typhus fever lies in the eradica- tion of lice, especially when people are confined in dose quarters such as jails and trenches, and particularly in keeping lice away from known typhus cases. Cleanliness, repellents, and delousing procedures are useful. DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-uichioroethane) appears promising. (See following section on vaccines.) Immunity and Therapy. Recovery from either form of typhus fever results in lasting immunity to both. blassive doses of vacches of killed organisms have been fairly successful in producing active immunity. The vaccine, formerly prepared by growing the organisms in lice and using the ground intestine by tissue culture in guinea pig testes, or maae from the lungs of infected rats, has been recently pro- duced from growth of the oqpkm in developing chick embryos. By the latter means, Bengston and Dyer of the 'l'nited States Public Health Senice have obtained a preparation free from bacteria and insect material."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"The serum of immunized goats or rabbits is being vied therapeu- tically and may prove useful. Chloromycetin and aureomycin are proving clinically effective according to widespread reports. Diagnosis. The Weil-Felix reaction is the main diagnostic tool. Complement hation is also used in Werentiating ~phus, especially the murine type, from spotted fever. The V.S.S.R. Institute of Experimental Medicine has recently reported a complement fixation test claimed to be very sensitive, strain-spdc, and applicable as early as the drst and second days of illness. Animal inoculation is also employed. SPOTTED FEVERS The* are diseases similar to typhus fever and characterized by petechial hemorrhages into the skin together with a rash and an incu- bation period of 3 to 9 days. The disease is transmitted from tick to tick hereditaxily and to man by the tick. It is not transmitted from nian to man, as is typhus fever (see p. 280). The disease is innocuous for ticks. It is most prevaleat in the northwestern United States. The causative agent, Rickettsia rickcUsi (alto known as..Rickeusia dernurcnttroxenus), can be transmitted experimentally to monkeys, guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs. It is found within the nucleus of the invaded cell. The disease has, with questionable correctness, usually been Wed into three very closely related types, all immunologically identi4 and caused by the same organism. One occurs in the eastern states and is transmitted chiefly by the dog tick, Dcmurccntw 06 abilir; one in the western states, particularly Bitter Root Valley, Montana, and transmitted by the sheep or wood tick, Drnmxntm andcrsoni; and one in Brazil (typbex4nthnnrJico) transmitted by Amblymnrcr cajmmnse. In the Cnited States, the disease is known as Rocky bfouniuin spotted fnrr. The mortality is very variable but runs nationally about 19%. The mortality in Brazil is about 707, Other spotted fevers include Fiicre Bouton~e, 6mya fw, Sod A fkn tkk-bite fever, SZa Paoh typhus. After the first week of the disease, the Weil-Felix agglutination test is positive. The serum usually has a titer ranging from 1 :20 to 1: 200, not as high as in typhus fever. Immunity and Prophylaxis. One attack of spotted fever usually confers lifelong immunity. There is a slight cross protection between typhus and spotted fevers. Immunization with massive doses of vaccines of killed organisms has been iakly successful. .h Kith typhus, these were formerly prepared from infected insects and now from tissue cultures or preferably from chick embryos. Measures to minimize contact with ticks are, of course, mandatory. These include wearing of tick-proof clothing, eradication of ticks by brush clearing, and removal of ticks from the body as quickly as possible. This is a group of similar febrile diseases resembling typhus fever and occurring in Japan and adjacent lands. The causative agent is Rickettsia kutsugamushi (also known as Rickettsia orientulir or Rick& tsia nipponka), which is transmitted to man by the bites of mite larvae occurring in swampy areas The larvae become infected fro= infected adults through the eggs. The adult mites do not bite mam- mals.

The animal reservoirs are mice and rats. Mortality may run to 50%. e One attack confers proionged but not absolute immunity.

Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"RG. 69. Intranudear inclusion bodies. Immunity. Recovery from a virus infection produces usually a solid and lasting, but sometimes a transient, immunity. Second attacks of yellow fever, poliomyelitis, hog cholera, smallpox, or measles are very rare. Lmmunity of about a year results from foot- and-mouth disease, dengue fever, and pappataci fever. ..In fever blistexs and common colds, immunity is very short. There is some evidence to indicate that lasting immunity when present is an infec- tion-immunity or immunity to superinfection. Viruses have been shown to persist in the body a long time after recovery. Various familiar immunizing substances-agglutinins, precipi- tins, neutralizing antibodies-have been identified in circulating blood, and the general nature of the immunity is believed the same as in other infections. However, the effectiveness of circulating antibodies against intracellular viruses has not been fully determined. .4ctive artificial immunity is highly successful with many tirus diseases. The serum nedralizution test is often used for study and diagnosis, e.g., poliomyelitis, influenza, t-accinia. This determines the protection afforded susceptible animals by mixtures of immune serum and virus in contrast to the development of disease in animals inoculated with normal serum and virus or xirus alone. Adaptability. This ability, characteristic of living things, is also an attribute of viruses. For example, rabies virus grown in dogs is very virulent for both dog and man. If cultivated in rabbits, how- ever, the rims becomes attenuated for dog and man and virulent for rabbits. Similarly, the selective tissue action of viruses can be modi- fied by inoculation into an abnonnal portal of entry. Resistance. A striking characteristic of most vimses is resist- ance to 50% glycerin, a property shared by only a very fevi bacteria. 17iruses may be preserved in 50% glycerin at icebox temperatures or by the lyophil process (wing and freezing). They are heat labile and also readily inactivated by direct sunlight. Size. By means of collodion membranes (gradacol membranes or uldters) of graduated and standardized porosities, electron microscope studies, and ultracentrifugation, viruses have been shorn to vary greatly in size but to be relatively uniform within each \"species.\" They range from about 215 mr* for psittacosis, 175 mp for vaccinia to 22 mp for yellow fever and 12 mp for poliomyelitis.

From this and other work, the belief is now held that the smaller vim are nudeoproteins and the larger viruses like va&h contain nudeoprotein, fat, and carbo- hydrate. NATURE OF VIRUSES The challenge of the nature of the material known as viruses has been met with a number of suggested explanations. The first-dis- covered virus of tobacco mosaic disease was believed by Beijerinck (1899) to be a living contagious fluid, by Wood (1899) an oxidizing enzyme, by Goldstein (1927) a protozoan parasite, by Vinson (1931) an inanimate chemical substance. Others have postulated that vinws are infinitesimally small living organisms or that they are autocatalytic substances producing disease and manufactured in certain injured and stimulated host cells. Gordon- (in Jordan and Bunows) makes two pertinent points: 1. the distinction between animate and inanimate matter may prove pointless as regards the viwes, and 2. it is unnecessary and udeshble to assume that all viruses are of essentially the same nature. Both he and Rivers suggest that the very small vim may be inanimate and the larger ones micromimbes. Antibiotics block bakerial metabolism and prevent the ass-- tion of amino acids in the synthesis of bacterial protoplasm. The smallest viruses are presumed to be nudeoprotein molecules and are thus unable to carry out metabolism; they therefore resist antibiotic action. Antibiotic action against virus diseases appears clinically proportional to their size. The larger the virus, the more susceptible it is to antibiotic action. KO chemotherapeutic or antibiotic agent is effective against the bulk of disease-causing viruses which are medium to small in size. VIRUS DISEASES OF lYUR Of the many virus diseases that dect man, the following list indudes the most important known to date: Variola or smallpox Vaccinia or cowpox -4lastrim Yaricella or chicl;enpoa Herpesu~ta Hupes simplex JIoliuscum contagiosum Vmca or warts Rubeola or measles Rubella or German measles Rabies or hydmphobii Anterior poliomyelitis or infantile par& ~Jis - Epidemic encephalitis, including St Louis encephalitis and Japanese en- cephalitis Type B AustraliauXdisearc Equine cncephaiomyelitis Lymphocytk choriomeningitis Yellow fever Epidemic inducnza Pappataci fever or sanay few Common cold Dengue or breakbone fever Parotiris or mumps Rift Valley fevu Psittacosis or parrot fever Trachoma Lym~hogmuloma venemm hdusion bienorrhea Epidemic I;eratoamjunctivitis Variola or Smallpox and Vaccinia or Cowpox. These two diseases are of historical interest because they wen the fuy for which an effective method of vaccination was devised. In 1798 Jenner reported that a boy inoculated u-ith material taken from a daiqmaid infected nith cowpox failed to develop smallpox when inoculated with pus obtained from smallpox lesions. Thus Jenner put into practical application his observation that the incidence of smallpox was rela- tively low among persons who lived in rural districts and came into contact with cows. 02ii"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Smallpox and cowpox are closely related. An attack of one pro- tects against the other. It is believed by some that vaccinia or cowpox virus is smallpox virus attenuated by passage through cattle. Smallpox is a generalized, febrile disease characterized by vesicular eruptions which become pustular and crust, often leaving permanent pox marks. The incubation period is 6 to 15 days. Fatality is usu- ally 10-30%. Transmission is by direct or indirect contact. Infec- tivity is high, starting in the incubation period and lasting well into convalescence. The skin lesions and respiratory discharges contain the virus. Vaccinia in man, produced by smallpox vascination, is a mild and usually ld disease. 1. The Vim. The virus passes through most filters, is resistant to low temperatures, glycerin, phenol, and ether, but is heat labile- a temperature of 55' C. or over destroys it It has been estimated to be 125 to 175 & in Site. Cytoplasmic inclusions, called Guarnieri or vaccinia bodies, may be found in epithelial cell lesions. In addition, small Paschen or elementary bodies may be demonstrated in vesicular fluid. These are believed to represent the virus. 2. Pathogmicity. Various animals, including horses, sheep, and cows, ari susceptible to pox diseases. 3. Luboratory Diagnosis. Several laboratory procedures are available to diflerentiate smallpox from other dkases with which it may be confused. Unfortunately, these tests do not distinguish be- tween smallpox, vaccinia, and alastrim. They include: (a) Fad Test. When the scarified cornea of a rabbit is inoculated with mate- rial from a suspected lesion, a typical kcratitis, in which Guarniui bodies am demonstrable miaoxopically, is OM if the lesion was dpo~ The test is positive in about 50% of the cases. (b) Buddingh's Tat. Material taken from smaUpox lesions is inoculated on the choriwallantoic membranes of the developing chick embryo. The production of typical pox lesions uithin 72 hours, smears of which show typical lesions and Paxhur bodies, is indicative of smallpox. This test is believed to be more reliable than the Paul test. (c) Intradanrul Tet. A normal rabbit inoculated intraddy with mate- rial from smallpox lesions develops swelling on the second day, pmceedmg to crust formation and desquamatioe An immune animal aill develop no such lesion or only a slight response. 4. Vaccines. The vaccine most generally employed is that pre- pared from calf lymph (serum from pustules) obtained by mbLig vaccinia ~irus into the ded abdomen of calves. The &ed areas are scraped off 5 days later, using sterile precauthns. The pulp is mixed with twice its weight of sterile water and forced through metal sieves. . The emulsion of finely divided tissue is mixed with 50% glycerin. Phenol up to 1 % or bnit green dye 1 : 10,000 is added to reduce bacterial contamination. The pulp is stored at 10' C. Po- tency tests are made, and cultures are prepandto exclude the presence of contaminants such as Miawocci, Streptococd, and anaerobic badL More recently introduced are vaccines prepared from virus grown in tissue culture or in the developing chi& embryo.

The disease has been shown to be distinct from smallpox, with which it may be confused clinically in the early stages. An attack of chickenpox does not protect against smallpox, nor does smallpox confer immunity against chickenpox. Elementary bodies which are agglutinated in convalescent serum are present in vesicle fluid. Chickenpox is believed by some investigators to be related to herpes zoster, for cases have been reported of children who developed chickenpox on contact with herpes mster. Complement-fig anti- bodies against fluid from herpes mter and variceb vesicles have been found in the sera of patients with herpes zoster and varicella Some cross agglutination has been observed. One attack of varicella usually protects against subsequent infection. Herpes Zoster. This disease, also turned shbgle~ or mna, is an acute derrnotropic virus disease characterited by a vesicular dermatitis in which the vesicles follow a nerve trunk. The virus has as yet not been transmitted to any experimental animals with filtered material. Inclusion bodies have been hi in cases of herpes mta. One attack confers a lasting immuniity. Herpes Simplex. This is a mild, dennotropic, acute, eruptive, virus disease of the skin and mucous membranes charaaaized by vesicles containing serous fluid, with subsequent scab formation but no scars. Vesicles on the lips and nostrils (cold sores), on the genitalia, or assodated with fwers (herpes febrilis, fever sores) are most common.

Herpetic infections have been reported following con- tact, local irritation, erposu~e to cold, heat, ultraviolet light, and other factors, dependent largely on the individual. Intranuclear inclusion bodies have been described in the lesions. Herpes virus is filterable through Berkefeld V and N candles. It is about 150 mp in size, a& is thennolabile, for a temperature of 50' C. destroys it. It may be cultivated in tissue cultures and in the developing chick. When inoculated onto the ded surface of a rabbit's cornea, a keratitis is produced. Virulent strains may become neurotropic. -4 fatal encephalitis has been produced in rabbits, and the intracerebral injection of herpes virus into mice produces characteristic transmissi- ble encephalitis. Infection with herpes simplex virus differs from most virus diseases in that the duration of immunity is uncertain or, at best, of short duration. Neutralization tests have demonstrated that the serum of persons recovering from herpes have neutralizing antibodies. Complement fixation antibodies also have been found. Antibodies have been noted in the serum of persons who paradoxically develop herpes simples, perhaps indicating a persistent latent infection. Molluscum Cootagiosum. This is a children's disease charac- terized by benign, epithelial nodules formed around the face or on the loucous membrane of the genitalia, and transmitted by contact.

Army experience, however, was rather successful with the administration of polj~aient, formoiized iduenza vaccine, and some indusuial plants have reported favorably on auenza vaccination. Common Cold. This is an acute, frequently epidemic, highly communicable disease transmitted by droplet infecuon. .It is charac- terized by catarrhal idammation of the nose, throat, trachea, naso- pharynx, and upper bronchi. Kumerous microorganisms, including pneumococci, Henzophilur influenme, and others, have been considered the etiologic agents from time to time. Filtrates of nasal secretions of persons with colds have produced infection in human volunteers inoculated intranasally. Clinical symp toms similar to those observed in man have been hated in chimpanzees with such filtrates, and it was possible to transmit the infection from ape to ape. A virus, believed to be the cause of common cold, has been culti- vated in tissue culture. Colds were produced in human volunteers inoculated with the culture. It is believed that the evidence for a virus etiology of common cold is substantial. Vaccines of bacteria have been found to be'of debatable l-alue when used prophylactidy or therapeutically. Parotitis or Mumps. This is an acute, communicable disease characterized by inffammation of the parotid or other salivary glands and frequent involvement of the testes and meninges. The disease is transmissible to monkeys. The production of orchitis and parotitis has also been reported in cats. One attack usually confers a lasting immunity. Convalescent serum has been used prophylactically dur- ing the incubation period. Psittacosis or Parrot Fever. This is a communicable disease of parrots transmissible to man through the respiratory tract by direct or indirect contact. It is caused by a tirus dth an ahity in parrots for the liver and spleen. The intranasal or intramuscular injection of the virus produces the disease in parrots. These animals after re- covery are ~fractory to subsequent infections. The disease is trans- missible to mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and MO~OCU( rhesus monkeys. In man the virus produces a pneumonia, after an incubation period of 10 to 30 days, and the virus may be demonstrated in the sputum and blood. The sputum may be inoculated intraperitoneally into white mice. The development bv the animals of an illness which is fatal usually within 5 to 11 days, and occasionally not before 30 days, is diagnostic. Lesions are'found in the liver and spleen. Cytoplasmic inclusion and elementary bodies are also demonstrable in infected mteria.1. They are small, coccoid forms arranged singly and in pairs, and are believed to be one stage in a developmental cycle. In monkeys intracerebra1 inoculation causes a meningo-enceph- ditis. One attack of the disease usually produces an active immunity lasting for some be. Complement-jixing and neuualizig antibodies are demonstrable in the sera of vaccinated and cont-alescent individ- uals. Intrrunuscular injections.of fresh, unattenuated tirus result in successful immuilization."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Lpm~ho~uloma Venereum. Also known as Iymphogranu- loma inguinale, this is a human contagious disease acquired by sexual contact and characterized by inflammation of the lymphatic glands of the inguinal region and development of small herpetiform lesions on the external genitalia. Intracerebral inoculation of rnodie~s and mice with suspensions of gland tissue result in meningo+ncephalitic lesions. Cats have also been experimentally infected. The virus is filterable through Chamberland Ls and Berliefeld V filters. It may be preserved by freezing at -2' to -3 C. for about 10 days, but is destroyed by heating at 60°C. for 30 minutes. Elementary bodies and a developmental cycle similar to the psittacosis virus have been observed. The disease may be diagnosed by a skin test known as the Frd test, performed by injecting intracutaneously into the forearm an antigen oi heated pus from an infected gland. The reaction reaches its height in about 48 hours, and consists of an idzmmatory, id- trated, dome-shaped area about 0.5 cm. in diameter, having in the center a small area of necrosis surrounded by a red zone. At the present time, a commercially-prepared antigen of. infected yolk-sac emulsion is being used. Lymphogranuloma is reported to produce a toxin similar to bac- terial endotorins, capable of causing production of spedfic antitoxin. It is also one of the few vkws that appear to be affected by the sul- fonamides. Rabies or Hydrophobia. This is a spedfic, fatal, virus disease of dogs and other animals, characterized by estreme irritation of the central nervous system and transmitted to man by the bites of infected animals. 1. The Vim. The saliva of infected animals contains the virus. In rabies the affected nerve cells contain cytoplasmic inclusion bodies called Negri bodies; their presence indicates rabies. The virus may be attenuated by drying in KOH, by exposure to 1% phenol, and by temperatures a'bove 45' C. It remains potent in glycerin at 7' C. for some time. Rabies virus has been cultivated in tissue culture and in the chick embryo. Such preparations have been studied for their &cacy as immunizing agents. Ifice have been made immune for about 9 months by the intraperitoneal injection of such cirus, and dogs have also developed a considerable immunity. 2. Disease. In man, after an incubation period, usually of 26 to 70 days, often longer, the first symptoms of di&culty in breathing and inability to swallow are obsen-ed, with a rise in temperature. In the dog the disease is manifested by increased aggressiveness, characteris- tic restlessness, loss of appetite, desire to bite, paroxysms of fury, rapid emaciation, paralysis, and death. Death in man occurs in the majority of cases on the third or fourth day after the appearance of symptoms. The development of rabies following the bite of a rabid animal is dependent upon the point of inoculation, the amount of virus introduced, and the strength of the virus. The period of incuba- tion is shorter and the dii is generally severe when the bite is on the face or in the tips of the hgen, where there is an abundance of nemes."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"3. Laboratory Bagnosis. (a) Spleud .Vethod. Spreads made from the cortu in the region of the fissure of Robdo or in the region corresponding to it in lower animalt, from boo's horn, and from the gray matter of the cerebellum are examined after staining with Giernsa's method ior th~ prexnce of Segri bodies, which appear magenta nith blue granules. (b) Aninrd Imculalion. If Segri bodies are not detected in the spreads, small portions of the hippocampus are emu!sified in sterile physiologic saline and about 0.123 ml. is inoculated subdually into guinea pigs or rabbits. Generally, death occurs after 16 days or longer, and Segri bodies may be demonstrated in the brain tissue on autopsy. -4 mouse inoculation test has been introduced recently. It consists of intra- cerebral inoculation of brain material Some of the mice are examined for ?ie@ bodies in the brain and others are studied for the appearance of characteristic U-&ess and paralysis of the hind. legs, prostration, and death. This method has the advantage of earlier diagnosis. (c) Serobgicd RCOClk. A mow protection test has been devised for meas- uring the antibodies in serum against rabies virus Complement kation tahnics have thus far yielded unsatisfacto~ results 4. Treatment and Prophyhis. Following the bite of an animal aII wounds should be immediately cleaned and, if possible, thoroughly cauterized with fuming nitric add. Various vaccines have been pre- pared for the prophylactic treatment of rabies following the bite of a rabid animal and for immunization of dogs. (a) Patcur's X&od. This procedure, uith some modi6cations. is still in w today. It is based upon the fact that rabies virus may be intcnsi15ed by passage through rabbits. Virus taken from the stmt dog is known 8s shed virus. The virulence for the rabbit of this virus, which to begin with produces rabies after an incubation period of from 12 to 14 days, may be enhanced so that the incubation period is reduced to about 6 or 7 days, after which the virus remains constant in virulence and is bm asjiud m'w. (Segri bodies an not demonstrable in bed vinrs infections, perhaps because of the shorter incubation period.) The hed virus is then subjected to various periods of drying to decrease its virulence. The course of treatment consists of 14 to 21 separate inoculations of 6x4 virus of increasing virulence. (b) Smplc's Method. Trmtmmt consists of a course of 14 injections, given daily, of 2 ml. of a vaccine prepared by incubating an 8% emulsion of brains of rabbits injected with rabies iixcd virus, in 1% phenol in normal salt solution far 24 hours at 37' C. and then diluting it with an qua1 volume of saline (thus making a 4% emulsion of the virus). The injections are made subcutmeously, usually over the abdomen. (c) Chloroform- and ultraviolet-light-treated virus have also been shm to be e5dent Mmunizers. (d) The most efficient methods of prevention lie in the muzzling of dog and in the quarantine of incoming animak for observatio~ A slight decrease in mortality from rabies has been shorn in the statistics from various parts of the world. Cases of para,lysis following the administration of vaccines have been reported. The immunity produced by antirabic treatment is variable. Anterior Poliomyelitis or Infantile Paralysis. This is a disease of the central nervous system in which the nen7e cells of the anterior horn of the spinal cord are injured, resulting in hccid paralysis of the muscles enervated by the damaged nerve cells. The disease is ushered in after an incubation period of 7 to 14 days Kith symptoms of fever, headache, stiffness of the neck, irritability, and gastrointes- tinal disturbances. Abortive poliomyeliiis is a form of the disease in which there is no evidence of muscle involvement. There may be only slight transient weakness, in which case the attack is termed nonpartdytic."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"1. The Vim. Poliomyelitis was successfully transmitted to monkeys by Landsteiner and Popper in 1908 by the intraperitoneal injection of spinal cord from a case of poliomyelitis. These investi- gators were unabie to carry the virus from monkey to monkey. Flexner and Lewis, in the same year, inoculated monkeys intracere- brally and found that with this route they could transmit the virus serially from monkey to monkey. Attempts to transmit the disease to other laboratory animals were unsuccessful, until recently when Armstrong reported the tmsm&sion of poliomyelitis (Lansing strain) to Eastern cotton rats by intracerebd injection. The infection of white mice has also been accomplished. The virus is enremely small, and its size is estimated as 8 to 12 mr. It resists desiccation, freezing, glycerin, and exposue to 5% phenol. It is, however, thermolabiie, a temperature of 45\" C. being lethal. 2. Porlol of Enlty. The virus has been demonstrated in the nasopha~ngeal washings of patients and of health; carriers. Mon- keys have been infected by intranasal instillations of the virus. Certain experiments in which the olfactory nerve has been severed or the nasal mucosa blocked by chemicals have shown that infection is prevented in monkeys so treated. Therefore, some believe that infec- tion with poliomyelitis virus occurs through the respiratrory tract. However, the isolation by many investigators of the vim from stools of human beings and monkeys infected with the disease has raised the possibidty of a gastrointestinal portal of entry. The virus has also been isolated from sewage and from &es. 3. Immunity. Well-nourished individuals seem to be more sus- ceptible to poliomyelitis than are poorly-nourished ones. One attack of the disease confers a strong immunity, second attacks being rare. The serum of convalescents contains antiviral substances which can be demonstrated by neuualization tests in monkeys. A large propor- tion of adults also have these neutralizing substances, and there does not seem to be much correlation between neutralizing titer and either the development of poliomyeliti5 or recovery from it. 4. Prophylaxis. Various methods have been attempted to pre- vent poliomyelitis, but at present there is no dective procedure for conferring an immunity of either slight or considerable duration. (a) C4cmt Serum. Although a number of studies have been made the prophylactic \\aim of convalerent serum or normal adult serum, then is no conclusive evidence that either one is of value. (b) Sad Spas. A high degm of resistance to poliomyelitis in rnofiq.5 was reported by several investigators but questioned by others after sprqing the 4 mucosa nith a solution of sodium aluminum sulfate (alum), 4% tannic acid, or piaic acid. However, trial of sprays in children during two epidemics fuded no evidence that either pi& acid alum spray or 1% zinc sulfate reduced the in& dace of poliomylitis. (c) Actioc Immunizdion. EU~QOUS vaccines eomkting of virus attenuated by formalin or sodium ricinoleate, killed virus, or serum-* mLrtures have been used for the immunktion of monkeys with variable results Formalin-inactivated virus was employed by Brodie for immunization of children, and Polmw used virus treated nith sodium ricinoleate These vaccines have been discontinued becau their safety was doubted. Ultraviolet-light-tnated, antigmic, but not iafative vkus has recently been reported to aEord high pr:tectian to mice."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Epidemic Encephalitis. During the past few years a number of infections of the central nervous system have been recognized as caused by viruses. These diseases have been termed epidemic me- pMitis and include St. Louis encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis Type B. They may be distinguished from encephalitis lethargica or von Economo's disease, for which no accepted etiologic agent has yet been isolated. Vm Ecotwmo's disease is a chronic sporadic infection. Following an acute stage, muscle spasticity, mental deterioration, and personality alteration occu. These may become worse and the patient may die, there may be recovery with some disability, or the patient may make a complete recovery. Herpes virus has been isolated in some of these cases, and is believed by a number of workers to be the cause of the disease. In Japan there is a type of encephalitis which is similar to Von Economo's disease. It has been referred to as Japanese encepha- litis Type A. 1. St. Louis Encephalitis. This disease was first recognized in epidemic form in 1933 in St. Louis. Following an incubation period of 4 to 21 days, symptoms of fever and meningeal irritation occurred. The disease had a short course and few sequelae. A virus mas recov- ered by the intracerebral inoculation of monkeys and mice with brain tissue of fatal cases. Neutralizing antibodies against the virus were demonstrated in the sera of patients recovering from the infection and also in the sera of persons Living in various parts of the United States. Reservoirs for the disease appear to be bids and a number of mammaln. hlosquitoes and probably ti& play a role in transmission. 2. Japanese Encephalitis Type B. In Japan there has been recognized a type of encephalitis which dZers from Type A in that it is more prevalent in the summer months. The disease is more acute and the incidence is highest among older persons. Although the disease was hst merentiated from Tj-pe A in 1928 and designated Type B, it was not until 1935 that its etiologic agent was isolated by the intracerebral inoculation of mice. The virus mers from that of St. Louis encephalitis in that it produces a more severe disease in monkeys It has been shown to be distinct from St. Louis encepha- litis virus by neutralization tests, but shows partial immunologic relationship to it by complement fixation. Insects may be involved in transmission. 3. Postinjedh Encephalitis. Cases of encephalitis following varicella, pertussis, typhus fever, and mumps have been reported. Vaccination against smallpox is occasionally followed by encephalitis known as postvaccinal encephalitis. The cause of these types of encephalitis is not known. Australian X Disease. This is a form of encephalitis which oc- curred in Australia in 1917-1918. It has been reported transmissible to sheep, and produces lesions similar to those caused in louping ill.

The virus has also been transmitted to mice. It is present in the brain, spinal fluid, blood, and urine of monkeys that are injected. -4 virus similar to that of lymphocytic choriomeningitis has been found in normal mice and in monkeys. The virus has been shown to be distinct from the l-imses of equine encephalomyelitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and poliomyelitis by means of neutralization and complement fixation tests. hhropods may play a role in transmis- sion. Yellow Fever. This disease is transmitted by the female mos qito, ,icdes aegypti, and is characterized by fwer, chills, muscular pain, jaundice resulting from liver damage, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, and vomiting of blood. Filterability of the causal agent, mosquito transmission, incubation period in the mosquito, and infec- tivity of the patient's blood were dehitely established by the Ameri- can Army Commission consisting of Reed, Carroll, Agramonte, and Lazear at the begimbg of this century, following earlier work by Carlos Fiy. 1. The Vim. Yellow fever is mnsmki'ble to monkeys by in- traperitoneal or inmdermal injections of the virus. Mice injected intracerebrally develop encephalitis, and the virus is altered from one with primarily ~iscerotropic properties to one that is neurotropic Intranudear inclusions are demonstrable in the liver of infected monkeys and man, and in the ganglion cells of mice. The virus has been estimated to be 17 to 28 mp in size It resists fmdng, drying, and exposure to glycerin' and fonnalin, but it is destroyed by heating at 60\" C. for 10 minutes. It has been cultivated in tissue culture. 2. Immunity. One attack confers immunity. Neutralizing antis have been demonstrated in the sera of a large number of individuals in -areas where yellow fever is prevalent. 3. Prophykzis. The subcutaneous injection of vaccine pre- pared with human immune serum and dried living virus fixed for mice praduces a rise in titer within a few weeks. Vaccination with vkus attenuated by prolonged cultivation in tissue culture has given some satisfactory results. 4. Jungle Yellow Few. Yellow fwer in the absence of A& acgypti has been observed in certain areas, and termed jungle yellow fever. This form of the disease and the causing virus appear identi- cal with the classical type. 5. PrePmtion. Many areas hare been freed from yebw fever by precautions taken to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. Pappataci Fever, SandfIy Fever, or Phlebotomus Fever. This is an acute, mild, febrile disease of tropical countries, which is trans- mitted by sandfiies. The disease is characterized by chills, fevers, conjunctivitis, and pains. It has an incubation period of 1 to 6 days. The virus is demonstrable in the blood. One attack confers immunity for at least 4 months and probably a year or more."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Dengue or Breakbone Fever. This is a mild disease of warm dimates, characterized by fever, headaches, muscular pains, and often a maculopapular rash. The disease is camed by the Acdct acgypti and a related mosquito, and it has been experimentally transmitted to man after an incubation period of 3 to 4 days by the injection of blood and serum filtrates from cases of the disease. The immunity conferred by an attack is of uncertain duration. Rift Valley Fever. This is primarily a disease of sheep, cattle, and goats, but produces in man an infection Rith spptoms of malaise, nausea, fever, and severe headache. The disease, which is probably mosquito-borne, has been transmitted experimentally to mice, mon- keys, and ferrets. Intranuclear inclusion bodies are demonstrable in the liver. The virus has been estimated to be about 23 to 35 mp in size, and has been cultivated in tissue culture. One attack confers immunity. Keutralizing and complement-fixing anui are found in the serum of cont-alescents from the disease. Trachoma. This is an eye disease, probably of virus origin, which is found in unhygienic surroundings and is hmckrked by granulated eyelids, conjunctivitis, arid lacrimal gland injury. Cell inclusions containing elementary bodies are found in the infected conjunctiva. After an incubation period of several days to a month, monkeys have been experimentally infected 6th rnaterial taken from cases of tra- choma However, characteristic inclusion bodies have not been found in the experimental disease.

Of these diseases of animals, rabies, psittacosis, equind encephalo- myelitis, foot-and-mouth disease, Rift Valley fever, and copx are transmissible to man. Some of these have been discussed in the pre- ceding section on xirus diseases of man. Foot-and-Mouth Disease. This is an acute, febrile disease of cattle, sheep, Bnd hogs, khich is characterized by vesidar eruptions inside the mouth and around the fee+ 0265"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"1. Virus. The causative agent of foot-and-mouth disease is present in the vesicular lymph and in the blood in the early stages. It is 8 to 12 mrc in diameter. It resists alcohol, chloroform, phenol, and glycerin, but is destroyed by alkali. It is destroyed at 37' C. in 24 hours, but remains active in the icebox for several months. Inocu- lation into guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, and cats produces the disease in these animals. Inclusion bodies have been observed in lesions after 24 and 48 hours. The virus has been cultivated in tissue culture con- taining guinea pig embryo tissue and dotted guinea pig plasma, 2. Transmissiott. The highly contagious disease is transmitted by direct or indirect contact with the virus released by rupture of the vesicles. Ingestion of contaminated raw milk is one of the factors involved. When transmitted to man, the disease is usually mild, with transient vesicles on the hands and feet and sometimes gastro- intestinal disturbances. 3. Immunity. Immunity following an attack usually lasts for a year. Vaccines of living virus, virus in cornbibation with immune serum, or formalinized virus have been used, but they do not protect animals against the disease. Swine influenza. This disease of swine has been shown to be caused by the combined action of a Glterable virus and the bacterium Hmophilus influenzac sub. The injection of virus alone produces a mild disease in swine. The bacterium has no dect on the animlla. The combination of the two, however, causes an illness which is similar to the natural disease in swine. Intramuscular injection of virus alone produces an immunity in swine against both the mild virus disease and the severe natural disease, but injection with the bacillus pro- duces no immunity whatsower. Antibodies against sffine influenza virus have been observed in the sera of adults, but were lading in the sera of children tested. When ferrets are injected with swine influenza virus a disease is produced similar to that caused by human influenza virus. It is believed that swine influenza virus is an adapted strain of human iduenza vkus causing the pandemic of iduenza in man in 1918-1919. By means of complement hation tests swine influenza virus cannot be differentiated from human iduenza virus. Sera of ferrets and mice that have been repeatedly inoculated with human auenza virus contain anties against both human and swine WIL Equine Encephdomyclitis. This is a disease first observed in horses but since found in a wide variety of wild and domestic nnimlla and bids. It is characterized by in9ammation of the meninges, with pyrexia, incoordination, vertigo, paresis, and motor and sensory paralysis. It is transmitted by mosquitoes and other blood-sucking insects. Three strains of virus Causing the disease have been identi- fied by immunologicalmethods-the severe eastern, the less set-ere western, and the Venezuelan. All three have been known to infect man. Formolized tissue culture and chick embryo virus vaccines have been used with good results in the immunization of horses and laboratory workers. For treatment of this disease an antiserum may be given with some benefit, particularly in the early stages. Rinderpest or Cattle Plague. This is generally a fatal disease characterized by catarrh, fever, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, and emacia- tion, and largely spread through contaminated food and water. The virus is present in the blood, secretions, and intestinal contents of infected animals. One attack confers immunity. Chlorofonn- treated emulsions of spleens and lymph nodes of animals brilled in the acute stage of the disease have been used for vaccination of cattle. However, the disease may be spread by sxh vaccinated animals. 0266"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Fowl Pox or Contagious Epithelioma This is a disease of chickens manifested by wartlike scabs on the combs and head. Ele- mentary bodies were described by von Prorazazek. Immunization with vaccine is highly successful. Canine Distemper. This is a disease of young dogs, foxes, and other animals. It is characterized by catarrhal inflammation of the respiratory tract and diarrhea. It has an incubation period of from 3 to 5 days. The disease may be prevented bi immunizing vaccines. Convalescent serum has been used to confer passive immunity, and has therapeutic value also. Hog Cholera. This disease was shown by Dorset, in 1903, to be due to a filterable virus, complicated by the presence of Salwumellu choleracsuis (suipcstijer) as a secondary invader. The virus is present in the urine. One attack of the disease produces a fair immunity, and simultaneous inoculation of hyperimmune antiserum and virus confen a lasting active immunity. Infectious My.omatosis of Rabbits. This is a highly fatal, virus disease of domesticated rabbits, characterized by tissue swellings forming gelatinous tumors and a purulent conjunctivitis. The virus is present in dkharges from the nose and eyes, and in the blood and suousexudates. The rapid spread of tumop to all parts of the body reminds one of a similar phenomenon in the case of human cancer. It is remarkable that injection of relatively benign fibroma virus into rabbits produces immunity against the cancer-like disease, iofectbus m yxomatosis'. Gardner, A. D.

When you think a thought, protein-like molecules called neuro-peptides are created. These neuro-peptides fit into receptors in the cell walls and in neurons. Intra-brain communication is by way of neuro-peptides. Immune system cells also have receptors for the same neuro-peptides, and they can also generate the same neuro-peptides, which supports the fact of these cells (like all cells in the body) being conscious. The immune cells make the same chemicals the brain produces during emotional and mental states. How does the immune system decide what is should deal with in the body and how it should deal with it? It has to remember the last time it encountered something. Through the genetic memory, it remembers the last time anyone encountered a specific chemical combination; it can recognize anything that has been encountered by any living species. The immune cells within the blood are, in effect, a circulating nervous system of a very special type. All cells in the body have some level of consciousness and produce hormonal and enzymal sunstances. During emotional states of joy and exhilieration, interluken and interferon are produced. During panick or terror states, cartisol andrenalyn is produced, which damages the immune system. Because any type of stress (societal, electromagnetic, or otherwise) affects the integrity of the immune system, the environment within the body is becoming more suited for deteriorating processes and a host of organisms that arise during such states. Thus, the increase in organic problems is paralleling the decline in civilization, but only for those who are steeped in social consciousness. For those who are accessing superconsciousness, the nature of the body is being altered to a point where health is no longer a problem.

Left handed people have higher rates of iaaune disorders and migraine headaches. In one London study of 253 lefties, the frequency of inmune disorders was found to be 2.1 times higher, especially thyroid and bowel disorders. The cells of the immune system appear equipped to respond to chericsl signals froa the central nervous system, Receptors have been found on the surfaces of lymphocytes for catacholines, prostsglandias growth hormones, thyroid hormone, sex hormones, serotonin, and endorphins, These neuroerdocvrines, neurotransmitters snd neuro- peptides may stimulate the differentiation, migration, and activity of lymphocytes. Eaotional states which involve the hypothalarus and other parts of the limbic system may also 'spill over\"and affect the immune systea. Both loneliness and rild stress are associated with decreased activity on (81) natural killer immune cells. It is possibly not the actual stress which brings on changes, but possibly the tmotional reaction to the stress. During certain typres of stress, the brain :eleases endorphins. Psychologists John Liebeskind and Yehuda Sbavit found that with the increased production cf endorphins, there was a corresponding decrease in activity and tumor-fighting ability in natural killer INK) c?lls. The surgical removal of certain aress in the hypothalamus leads to suppression of immune system response, while stirulation leads to 2nhancec immune sys:en response.

This state of resistance is indicated either by the failure of the individual to develop the disease upon exposure, or in some cases by the demonstration of specific immune bodies in the blood which are considered effective against the invading organisms. Natural Immunity. This is a type of immunity with which an individual is born. It enables him to resist infection without first having the disease. 1. Species. This immunity is characteristic of a particular species. Example: Dogs are immune to anthrax and tuberculosis. 2. Rad. This immunity is characteristic of a particular race within a species. Example: Algerian sheep are immune to anthrax. In the races of man, Negroes are said to be relatively resistant to yellow fever and more susceptible to tuberculosis than whites. The issue, however, is obscured by many other factors, including a possi- ble congenital immunity in the former case and economic status in the latter. 3. Indidual. This immunity, characteristic of particuiar indi- viduals, may be largely attributable to acquired immunity due to an earlier, mild, unrecognized attack of the disease. 4. Congenital. This immunity, found in the newborn, is due to the passive transfer of antibodies from mother to offspring through the placenta. Thus, infants in the first year of life are resistant to diphtheria and scarlet fever. Acquired Immunitp. This immunity is acquired by the individ- ual during his lifetime. 1. Active. This is a relatively lasting immunity due to the de- velopment within the individual of antibodies as a result of contact with the microorganisms or their products. The body cells and tissues themselves react to produce the spedc immunity. (a) Naturally Acquired. This immunity is attained as a result of an at.2.A of the disease itself. One attack of certain diseases confers iiielong immunity. Examples: diphtheria, whooping cough, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, yellow fever, most virus diseases. (b) ArtificioUy Acquired. This immunity results from a course of immunization with attenuated cultures* (e.g., smallpox vaccina- . . tion, Pasteur's rabies \"treatment\"), killed cultures (e.g., formalrnued pneumococcus vaccines), sensitized bacterial vaccines, toxin, toxin- antitoxin, toxoid (e.g., diphtheria immunization). 2. Passive. This is a short-lived immunity in which the anti- bodies are produced in another animal whose blood or serum is injected into the person. The body cells of the treated individuals take no part in producing the immunity. BIBLIOGRAPHY Dubos, Rene J. The Buctmmd CJI. Cambridge, Jlass.: Harvard t'niversity Press. 1945. 4.229-274.

These are termed antigens and antibodies respectively. An antigen is any substance which stimulates the production of specific antibodies. Antigens are protein in nature, and practically all proteins, except the incomplete ones such as gelatin, are antigenic. Specificity of the antigen is determined by its chemical composition. .ln untibody is formed by the &ma1 body in response to the presence of antigen nith which it combines in a specific, antagonistic manner. The antibodies are closely associated, and may be identiml, with serum globulin. They may be separated from other serum con- stituents by dilution with distilled water or more often by salting out. Korthrop has prepared crystalline diphtheria antitoxin which appears to be pure protein and contains 700,000 to 1,000,000 antitoxic units Per gram- The five main types of antibodies, as determined by their action, and the leading organisms stimulating their production are listed below. 1.

(inhibiting reproduction) and neutrdizing antibodies, two other types about which there is limited knowledge, may be pro- visionaUy added. Ehrlich believed that the diEerent demonstrable antibodies were separate and distinct substances. Zir and others, however, have proposed a \"unitarian\" hypothesis-that the various antibodies stim- ulated by a single antigen are essentially identical regardless of the consequences of the antigen-antibody union. These are variable and depend on the nature of the antigen and the conditions of the reaction. Haptencs, or partial antigens, described by Landsteiner, are rela- tively simple substances unable to stimulate antibody production when injected by themselves but determining immunological sped- bity when combii with antigenic protein. The spedic antibodies produced react with the haptene alone or with the combined protein- haptene, both in tho and in do. Not necessarily proteins, the haptenes are exemplified by the polysaccharide Specific Soluble Sub- stances (S.S.S.) found in the pneumococcus capsule. A widely distributed hcterophile antigen, described by Forssmpnn. stimulates production of hemolysin against sheep's red blood cells when injected into rabbits. The antigen has been found in organs of guinea pigs, horses, dogs, cats, mice, fowl, and tortoises, and in some bacteria."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Ehrlich regarded toxin-antito-sin interaction as purely chemical and equivalent to the neutralization of acids by alkalies. Thus, the union was postulated to take place according to the law of multiple proportions. Therefore, if one part of antitoxin neutralizes one part of toxin, 500 parts of antitosin should neutralize 500 parts of toxin. Danysz, however, observed that when toxin is added to antitoxin in fractions after some lapse of time between additions, a mixture which is nontoxic when toxin and antitoxin are added at once, becomes toxic. This is the Danysz phcnmmon. Bordet and Landsteiner believe that the toxin-antitoxin reaction is an adsorption phenomenon, and there is strong evidence to substantiate this view. Toxoid. It has been observed that toxin,. when kept for a long time, deteriorates, until it is no longer toxic Exposure of toxin to 0.4% formalin at a temperature of 37\" to 40' C. for about a month produces a product (td or anatozin) which is innocuous but is at the same time antigeqic and capable of producing a high titer of anti- body. Such preparations have been made from the toxins of Cmync- bacterium diphtheriae and Clostdivm tetuni and are used in immuniza- tion against diphtheria and tetanus, respectively. ~lum-prcc~pitdcd toroid is preferred by many because it is largely protein-free and be- cause the antigenic stimulus is operative for a longer Hod owing to the slow liiiation of toxoid.

AGGLUTYBOGEHS AND AGGLUTININS Certain bacteria, foremost of which is Salmonel& typhosa, when inoculated into animaln cause production of antibodies in the serum which clump a suspension of the specific orgh when the serum is mixed with it. Such antibodies are called agglutinins or receptors. They are also present in the serum of patients with typhoid fever, and the clumping of typhoid bacilli by immune serum has been used by Widal in his agglutination test for diagnosis. Nature of Agglutinins. 1. Agglutinins are heat resistant, but are destroyed by temperatures between 60' and 70° C. 2. They are destroyed by alkalies. 3. Exposure to heat and acids causes agglu- tinins to lose their dumping power, but they can still combine with the agglutinogen. 4. Agglutinins are specsc for a particular organism, but related organisms will agglutinate them at a low titer. 5. Agglu- tinins persist for a long period of time in sera dried in racuo and stored. 6. They do not liill bacteria, and both living and dead bacteria can be agglutinated."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Mechanism of Agglutination. ' 1. Bordet showed that aggluti- nation occurs upon the mixture of immune serum and a suspension of bacteria only when salts are present. The bacteria combine with the agglutinins in the absqce of salts, but for visible agglutination or clumping to occur, the presence of salts is necessary. 2. Bacteria carry a negative charge. The electrical charge is also negative in the usual menstruum. Therefore the bacteria having the same charge as the medium repel one another, and in so doing stand apart in a free suspension. Spdc immune serum, however, carries a positive charge. Therefore, when it is mixed with a corresponding nega- tively charged suspension of bacteria, the unlike charged particles attract one another, resulting in the dumping or agglutination of the bacteria. 3. Bacteria may be agglutinated in the absence of antibodies by the addition of acid to a suspension (acid agglutina- tion). 4. Some bacteria, like Streptococci, undergo spontaneous dumping. Rozone or Proagglutinoid Phenomenon. The agglutinating titer of a serum is the highest dilution at which agglutination takes place. It has been obsuved that in some instances low dilutions'of serum cause poor agglutinatior? or even fail to agglutinate bacteria, when higher dilutions will produce the phenomenon. This is called the prozone or pmagglutinoid phenomenon and has been attributed to the presence of agglutindids which prevent dumping. Predpitins are antibodies formed in response to the injection of soluble antigens, which, when mixed with the antigen, aggregate the molecules with the formation of a precipitate. Precipitation does not occur in the absence of electrolytes. Applications of the Precipitation Test. 1. Because of its high spec5aty the test is useful in the detection of anv other meat which may be substituted and distributed as beef. 2. The test has wide application in law in the detection of stains made by human blood. The stained materia is extracted and the solutions are tested with various antisera prepared in rabbits by the injection of blood of cows, horses, dogs, and man. 3. The test is used in bacteriological investi- gations in the differentiation of types of pneumococci, and also in the detection of anthrax infection of animal tissues (Ascoli themopre- cipitin test). 4. The Kalm precipitation and the Kline microscopic precipitation tests are used in the diagnosis of syphilis. (See p. 274.) Technic of the Test (Pneumococcus Typing). For a precipita- tion test it is necessary to have a serum of 4 high titer, and one whose degree of s@city is known. The test is performed as follows in typing pneumococa: 1. Into each of a series of sd agglutination tubes pLce 0.5 mL of properIy diluted aatipnamd setum and float ovu it 0.5 ml. of clear supernatant fluid taken from the centrifuged peritoneal washings of a mow injd with sputum or a suspension containing pncumococci"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"2. Udy a precipitation reaction cccurs immediately in the tube coctain- ing the homologous immune serum, but no precipitation occurs with the hetcroh- pus serum. 3. If the superuatlllt fluid is added carefully so that it does not mix with the serum, a positive test will be indicated by a ring of white precipitate at the point of contact. 4. When the fluid and senun arc mixed, a positive test is indicated by a precipitate which is visible throughout the mixture. If no immediate reaction occurs, place the tuba in a water bath at 3P C., and observe after incubation for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes. CYTOLYSINS AND COMPLEMENT The cytolysins, also called amboceptms or smsitizcrs, are anti- bodies which lyse or dissolve bacteria or red blood cells. The visible reaction of lysis does not occur unless there is present a normal non- speciiic constituent of seruxn, called dain or complement, which also combines with the cell. Complement, normally prkt in the blood of all a&&,, deteri- orates rapidly. It is thermolabile and is inactivated by a temperature of 56' C. for one-half hour. In order for complement to act, the cells must already have been sensitized by the amboceptor or sensitizer. Complement does not combine with antigen in the absence of am& ceptor, but antigen and amboceptor will unite regardless of the presence of complement . Mechanism Ehrlich believed that complement acts upon anti- gen only indirectly through the amboceptor, wbich functions as a bridge between the first two. The Bordet view, held by most investi- gators, is that the union is a spec& adsorption, the sensitized antigen being rendered suscepa3le to the action of complement. Pfeiffer Phenomenon. It was noticed by Pfeiffer that living cholera vibrios, injected into the peritoneal cavity of guinea pigs that had been rendered immune, underwent certain changes when the peritoneal exudate was e!xamined at various intervals. The organisms were observed to become (a) nonmotile, (b) swollen, (c) coarsely granular, (d) indistinct in outline, and (e) My dissolved completely. This phenomenon of le was attributed by PkZer to the presence of ba~t~olysin, a substance which was present only in immune serum and could be transferred to normal animals by injection of immune serum. The process was later shown by ~ordet to be the result of the activity of two substances--one, the thermostable bacteriolysin which acted only in the presence of the other, the thermolabile complement, a constituent of normal serum. If the serum containing complement was inactivated by heating at 56' C. for one-half hour, the immune senun lost its abiity to lyse the bacteria However, if serum con- taining complement was added to such an inactivated serum, the bacteria were dissolved. Bordet-Gengou Phenomenon It was noted by Bordet and Gengou in 1901 that when inactivated s-c immune serum and a culture of P(xfteur& pestis were mi. together with complement. the complement was bound or fixed in destroying the bacilli. This was visibly shorn by using a hemolytic system consisting of a sus- pension of washed rabbit red blood cells and antirabbit hemolysin. If complement had been free it would have been detected by the hemolytic system, and lysis of the red blood cells would have occurred, for hemolysin can act only in the presence of complement. However, in this case no hemolysis occurred. Khen normal serum was used 0274"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"instead of immune serum it was noted &at hemolysis of the red blood cells occurred. Since specific amboceptor was not present in the normal serum to sensitize the cells, the complement had not been bound, but was left free to take part in the lysis of the red blood cells by the hemolysin of the hemolytic system.

The hemolytic system employed by Bordet and Gengou to give a visible reaction for the union of antigen and antibody has been utilized in similar tests for the diagnosis of such diseases as glanders, syphilis, gonococac and zneningococcic infections; tuberculosis, and whooping cough. Wasser- ~m perfected a complement btion test for the diagnosis of syphilis. This test requires a bacteriolytic system and a hemolytic system, which gives an index as to whether the complement has been bound by the bacteriolytic system. OPSOrOllOS AX?D PHAGOCYTOSIS One of the mechanisms whereby the body cells get rid of certain bacteria and foreign material is by ingestion of these substances. Any cell rhich destroys rdicroorgankms by enveloping and absorbing them is called a phagocytc. The intracellular digestive process whereby the leucqtes and certain fixed cells eat up or phagocytize the various invading bacteria is known as pkagocytosis. Opsonins. Uetchnikoff * observed that the process of phagocy- to& occurs more readily in the presence oi immune serum than with normal serum. To the substance responsible for the enhancing of the tendency of leucocytes to engulf bacteria, Wright gave the name opsonin, and Xeufeld called it backriotropin. That opsonins are necessarq- ior the process of phagocytosis is shown by the observation that when bacteria or white blood corpuscles are washed free of serum, the absorption and ingestion of invading bacteria do not take place. Opsonins are also present in normal serum. Following infection with certain microorganisms the amount of opsonins is increased. Opsonins exhibit characteristic antibody specificity. Their activity appears to be the result of two components--one thermostable, and one thennolabile, present ih normal serum, and resembling complement in many ways. Generally, there is a positive chemotactic influence exerted be- tween the phagoq-tes and the bacteria. The leucocytes engulf the bacteria and ingest them. Bacteria so phagocytized first become swollen, then coarsely granular, finally lose their outline, and then disappear entirely within the cytoplasm of the phagocytes. Opsonic Index. The opsonic action of a serum is measured by determining its opsonic index, which is the number of bacteria pha- Xletchnikoff's insistence on the importance of phrgocytb as the sole basis of immuni* is incorporatd in his celluLw lkroy of immunity.

Phagocytic Cells. Phagocytosis is produced by the microphages or wandering phagocytes, and the macrophages, and also the cells of the reticulwndothelial system. 1. The microphges include the leucocytes. Following an infec- tion of the skin with Streptococci there is a migration of polymorpho- nuclear leucocytes to the site of infection, and these ingest the bacteria. The leucocytes degenerate, become cloudy, swollen, and fatty, and disintegrate. These degenerated phagocytes plus debris, blood serum, and the digested bacteria constitute the substance commonly known ai Pus. 2. The macrophuga include the large mononudear leucocytes. In infection with Mycob(~~terium tuberculosis these cells surround the bacteria. The polymorphonuclear leucocytes do not appear in the later stages of the disease, but may be of some importance in the be- ginning of the disease in disposing of bacteria. 3. The returrlo-endothdid system, induding the endothelial cells lining the capillaries and the liver, the spleen, the bone marrow, and the lymph sinuses, play some role in phagocytosis. It is claimed that these tissues are responsible for the production of humoral antibodies, and also phagocytize bacteria. OTHER -ODES It has been suggested that there are at least two other types of antibody actions. 1. Ablutins-reproduction-inhibiting antibodies which prevent multiplication of the invading organism. 2. Ncutrd- king antibodies-which render the infectious agent, generally a filter- able virus, noninfective, when mixed and incubated with it MECHANISM OF -TIGER-mODY REACTION The antigen-antiiy reaction takes place in two stages. The first involves union of the elements, and the second, the consequences of that union which appear as agglutination, etc. Historically there have been two major theories proposed to explain the mechanism of the reaction. Ehrlich's Side-Chain or Receptor Theory. 1. Interaction of antigen and antibody is a chemical phenomenon. 2. Body cells obtain nutriment through localized cell substances called receptors or sidechains, which have combining ahities with food and other substances. 3.

The first one is the development of man-made electromagnetic fields and the effect on human beings. The second is the development of electromagnetic methodology for the deliberate control of the physiological, psychological and behavioral functions of human beings, mind control. We will discuss the research that reflects advanced mind control applications that has been done since the publication of Matrix 11. Be sure that you have read the information in previous chapters. I. MAN-MADE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS AND THEIR EFFECTS The supplementary electromagnetic fields that were super- imposed over the already existing natural electromagnetic phenomena began in the late 19th century. By 1882, Thomas Edison had set up the first generating station in the United States, transmitting low-voltage direct current (DC) to down- town New York. Around the same time period, Tesla developed the alternating current (AC) system which was capable of transmitting greater power over longer distances. By 1894, Tesla's generators at Niagra Falls were in operation. By 1898, AC transmission lines 75 miles in length were in use in California. In 1890, Heinrich Hertz discovered that a spark gap would produce a spark at a similar gap a few feet away without being connected. Hertz would later be involved with several other scientists in the rewriting of Maxwells equations - an action that would severely limit human progress in the field of physics and electronics thereafter. In 1901, Marconi trans- mitted the letter \"s\" across the Atlantic ocean, followed by radio transmissions in 1918 from England to Australia. By the late 1920's, commercial radio transmissions had become common- place and electrical power of up to 200,000 volts was being transmitted over hundreds of miles by means of Tesla's tech- nology. Since World War I1 it is estimated that electric power and communication systems have been growing at between five and ten percent per year. New technologies have appeared which i ncl ude cell ul ar telephone networks and sate1 1 i te re1 ay stations - in short, the human population has been overwhelmed with a profusion of electromagnetic smog. Before 1900, the electromagnetic field of the Earth was composed of the GMF and its associated micropulsations, visible light, and random discharges of lightning. What was not realized by the majority"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 of people was that the exposure of living organisms to abnormal electromagnetic fields results in significant abnormalities, both in physiology and behavior. Electrical power systems operate at 50-60 cps, just above the highest naturally occurring frequency of 30 cps. Micro- wave systems operate at billions of cycles per second and are rapidly getting closer to the trillion-cycle frequencies of visible light. The previously empty electromagnetic spectrum between these two extremes was filled with man-made radiation in less than 80 years. When man began to make use of the electromagnetic spectrum, it was recognized that it could be generally divided into two areas. Frequencies below those of visible light lacked the power to produce ionization of the chemical structures of the body and were called non-ionizing radiation. Frequencies higher than visible light contained enough energy to damage physical organisms: ionizing radiation caused the formation of free radicals within an organism and other damaging effects. Because non-ionizing radiation appeared to lack the ability to produce these effects, it was assumed that it had no biological effect. In fact, it was assumed that any biological effect that was not the result of ionization was the result of heat, since it was discovered that frequencies of about 27 million cycles (27 MHz) and higher produced heating of tissues. The dividing line for the production of heating effects was set at 27 MHz. In 1953, Dr. John McLaughlin, a medical officer for the Hughes Aircraft Corporation, identified cases of unexplained bleeding, leukemia, and brain tumors among workers exposed to low-strength microwaves. Since most of the Hughes contracts were military contracts, it turned the problem over to the military. In 1955, the British journal Nature reported that a short exposure to pulsed, 27 MHz radio signals produced abnormalities in the cells of the growing root tips of plants; it was the same frequency, 27 MHz, that had been assigned to the medical profession for use in radiowave therapy. The study was ruthlessly criticized. Within ten years, other researchers reported the same results at the FDA. Others reported finding the same effect at \"non-thermal\" levels. Creat ion of \"Safety Standards\" In 1950's, the Department of Defense recognized the necessity for adoption of some sort of standards for exposure to microwaves. This led directly to. the establishment of the Tri-Services Program, which was based at the Rome Air Development Center in Rome, New York, and given the task of determining this standard. Reports of non-thermal effects were pretty much ignored despite their obvious implications, and the military continued"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1x1 to dominate the field with their view that ionizing radiation was the only dangerous radiation and that there were no bio- logical effects other than \"thermal effects\". However, some \"safety standard\" had to be developed for the thermal effects. On the basis of theoretical calculations, it was postulated that microwave exposure at 100 milliwatts (mW) to an area of 1 square centimeter of body surface would exceed the ability of the blood circulation to carry away the heat produced, and local tissue heating would occur. By 1957, the military adopted a standard for exposure to microwaves of 10~w/cm~. In 1966, the American National Standards Institute adopted the same standard for recommended civilian exposure for occupational purposes. This is all that is generally known by most people about the creation of the ANSI standard for exposure of 10mW/cm*. A little more digging, however, revealed a little more of the covert aspects behind the development of this so-called \"standard\". The generally proposed 10mW/CM2 EMR exposure limit was done under the Tri-Services program based on the work of Professor Herman P. Schwan, a former Nazi scientist who entered the United States in 1947 under Project Paperclip. Schwan created a \"model\" in 1953 using metal balls and flasks of salt to simulate the human body. With little debate or experimentation, industry and the military accepted the results of Schwans experiments as representing a true picture of thermal effects. Adoption of the standard by ANSI is remarkable since Schwan consistently maintained that his dosage limit was safe for probably no more than an hour. (Becker, R.O., and Selden, G. (1985), The Body Electric, New York: Morrow); (Schiefel- bein, S. (1979), \"The Invisible Threat. The Stifled Story of Electric Waves\", Saturday Review, 15 September, p16-20). There were persuasive economic reasons why the 10,000-microwatt [=10mW/cm2] standard was and still is defended at all costs. Lowering it would have curtailed the expansion of military Electromagnetic Research and cut into the profits of the corporations that supplied the hardware. A reduced standard that was safe would constitute an admission that the old one was unsafe, leading to liability for damage claims from ex-GIs and industrial workers. One of the strong- est monetary reasons was given in a 1975 classified summary of the Department of Defense Tri-Service Electromagnetic Radiation Bioeffects Research Plan: \"Lower standards will significantly restrict the military use of EMR in a peacetime environment and require the procure- ment of substantial real estate around ground-based EMR emitt- 0288"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 ers to provide buffer zones\". The needed real estate was esti- mated at that time to be 498,000 acres. The price of the land would surely run into billions of dollars. (Becker and Selden, ~305 1 In 1982, ANSI \"reviewed\" reviewed the original 10mW/cm2 standard and revised it in light of \"new knowledge\". This time, great attention was paid to the theoretical relationship between the wavelength of a radio signal and the length of the human body. If we say that the average human body is six feet in length, then the frequency range of 80 to 100 MHz would overlap both above and below six feet. This frequency just happens to over-lap the 88 - 108 MHz FM frequency band. Again, with nothing more than theory, ANSI adopted a new \"standard\" that was frequency dependent but was still based on the \"thermal-effects\" concept alone. In 1984, The Environmental Protection Agency was on the point of proposing a standard of 100uW/cm2 but was forced to back down under pressure from its own policy office. In 1988, the EPA announced that it was postponing its decision indefinitely (Microwave News, Sept/Oct 1988). Even if the ANSI, which is composed of key researchers for industry and the military, adopted a standard which was designed to limit exposure to reasonable levels, the ANSI standards are recommendations, not provisions that are en- forceable. There exist no enforceable standards in the U.S. for the limitation of electromagnetic radiation. Some states have adopted certain limitations through their legislatures, but those limitations are within ANSI guidelines. Its sort of like asking the fox to guard the henhouse. Despite the denial by the military and the government of biological effects from non-ionizing radiation, in 1974 the Office of Naval Research began collecting published scientific reports from around the world in the genera1 area of \"bio- logical effects of non-ionizing radiation\" and publishing abstracts as a digest. This digest is still being published. The University of Washington Study Dr. Arthur Guy, a former consultant for ANSI, participated in a $5 million study at the University of Washington that was ' funded by the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine in the early 1980's. It was a $5 million study that backfired. The study was to determine if their were potential hazards to human beings from chronic exposure to microwave radiation. 'In the study, Guy used gnotobiotic rats, meaning that they were considered germ and virus free. This fact alone was one of the reasons for the excessive cost. All of the animals use, both experimental and control animals, were gnotobiotic."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 In this study, rats were continuously exposed to high- frequency microwaves of 2.45 GHz (billion Hz) at a field strength of .5mW/cm2, twenty times lower than the \"safe\" thermal level. One hundred fifty-five measurements of health and behavior were collected. According to Guy, there were primary malignant tumors that developed in eighteen of the exposed animals but in only five of the controls. Guy made the attempt to get around the results of the test by saying that the results were \"not statistically significant or came and went, suggesting that they may be due to chance.\" The use of \"germ-free\" animals in the experiments would seem odd, because we live in world surrounded by organisms. An experiment on germ-and-virus free animals has no relevance to the real world. Present evidence seems to indicate that at least 20% of human cancers are caused by viral infection, and this percentage appears to be even higher in animals. Therefore, animals that are maintained to be gnotobiotic should have an incidence of cancer that is much lower than expected. It is also well established that exposure to any abnormal electromagnetic field produces a stress response. If the exposure is prolonged, the stress response system becomes exhausted, and the competency of the immune system declines to below normal. In such a state, animals and humans are more susceptible to cancer and infectious diseases. One can only conclude that the experiment was deliberately designed to sharply reduce the incidence of cancer and infectious diseases in the exposed animals. There can be no other reason for the requirement that the animals be gnoto- biotic. In Guy's study, the fact that the experimental animals had a lower-than-normal incidence of cancer was totally expected. What was unexpected by Guy was that even with this protection, the cancer incidence in the animals exposed to' microwaves was four times that in the control animals. The well-designed experiment that should have \"proved\" that \"microwaves are safe\" fell into its own trap, and the nature of the trap is revealed by the types of cancer that occurred in the experimental group. These were mainly limited to cancers of the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands. The experiment was designed to prevent the results of stress, but the planners forgot that it would produce stress. Because stress resistance is connected with the glands just mentioned, we must conclude that microwave exposure produced an extremely high level of stress. If the animals had been normal instead of germ-free, they would have died long before the close of the experiment. This project was reported in the July-August 1984 issue of Microwave News. Another oops! for the govern- ment. Microwaves and Genetic Effects In 1983, studies by the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health reported that sperm production in male"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 mice exposed to non-thermal levels of microwaves decreased and was accompanied by significant abnormal changes in the structure of the chromosomes of the sperm. Researchers E. Manikowska-Czerska, P. Czerska, and W. Leach concluded that chromosomal abnormalities were produced by microwave exposure at dose rates far below those producing a heating effect. They noted that the mechanism appeared to be a direct effect of the microwaves on the chromosomes themselves. In a recent study, doctors at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital surveyed 69,277 newborn infants and identified infants with major developmental malformations. Some of these had no family history of problems, and the malformations appeared to be the result of spontaneous mutations. The infants were born during the years 1972-1975 and 1979-1985; it appears at this time that at least 30 percent of genetic developmental defects in human infants are the result of some external cause. Vernon, New Jersey is a small town of about 25,000, but it is fifth in the nation for the number of microwave transmitters. The incidence of Downs Syndrome cases in Vernon is 1000% above the national average. A possible explanation for the production of genetic effects by microwaves is that the wavelengths of the micro- wave radiation may be small enough to have a resonant effect on the DNA molecule or the chromosomes. In 1988, Dr. Reba Goodman reported at a meeting of the Bioelectromagnetics Society that the effects appeared to be different for different frequencies, and that they also differed depending ' on the type of cell exposed. Both ELF and microwave radiation have the capability to influence genetic material during the process of cell division. There are even indications that DC fields can influence mitosis and chromosomal patterns. Microwaves and Bra in Tumors During the years between 1940 and 1977, there was an un- precedented increase in the use of microwaves. During that same period, the incidence of primary brain tumors rose between 1.70 to 2.00 per 100,000 people. ELF Radiat ion From Power 7 ines While only a portion of the population is exposed to microwave radiation, most of the population is exposed to the 60 Hz fields given off by the electrical web that surrounds the population. The 60 Hz electric power frequency lies within the band termed \"extremely low frequency\" (ELF), which covers the region from zero (DC) to 100 Hz. It was formerly"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 considered impossible for an ELF field to have any biological effect; the wavelengths average about 3,000 miles. These ELF fields, however, have some interesting properties. They may be transmitted over great distances through the ionospheric cavity, a factor that played a part in Project Sanguine. This project was instituted by the Navy, using huge antenna arrays designed to operate at either 45 Hz or 70 Hz in order to have commu.nication with the submarine fleet as far away as the Indian Ocean. A large antenna was constructed at Clam Lake in Wisconsin, and studies were done to gauge the effects on nearby humans - a study that was completed in 1973. It was found that a one-day exposure to the field produced a significant increase in the serum-triglyceride levels .in 90% of the people studied. Serum-triglyceride levels are increased by the stress response and are related to fat and cholesterol metabolism. The power field strength from Project Sanguine was a million times smaller than that of the field produced by the ulta-high voltage (275 Kva and above) transmission lines that cri-ss-cross the country. After the meeting to discuss the results, the Navy denied that the meeting had ever taken place and insisted that it had no knowledge of any scientific studies indicating possible harm to human beings from the operation of the Sanguine system. The results of chronic exposure to 60 Hz electric fields are many. British studies are far more numerous and more widely published than American studies. Dr. Stephen Perry, who worked for the British National Health Service as a family practice physician in a rural area of England reported that he had observed that his patients who lived near electric power lines appeared to have a higher incidence of mental disturbances and suicide. This.was not.well received by various authorities. There were subsequent epidemiological studies which confirmed the data, and the findings were published in 1976. A second study was published in 1979. Dr. Nancy Wertheimer, an epidemiologist at the University of Colorado, was examining the possible relationship between the magnetic field from electrical lines (not the high-voltage lines we previously discussed, but the secondary lines that are strung everywhere). She made a startling discovery: 60 Hz magnetic fields with strengths of only 3 milligauss ( three- thousands of a Gauss - the Earths magnetic field averages .5 Gauss) were statistically related to the incidence of child- hood cancers. This field strength is many times smaller, as mentioned above, than the Earths normal magnetic field strength, and it is far below the average strength of 100 rnG at a distance of approximately 50 feet from the standard transmission line. Wertheimer published her data in 1979. Her paper was immediately subjected to bitter criticism, solely on the disbelief that it could be true."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 New York State did a study of power lines costing $500, 000 that was conducted over a five-year period. The New York State Department of Health decided to have Dr. David Savitz of the University of North Carolina repeat the Wertheimer study. After five years, Savitz obtained the same results as Wertheimer. He reported that 20% of childhood cancers appeared to be produced by exposure to 3-milligauss power frequency magnetic fields. The results of the New York State Power-Lines Project were released in 1987. It contained this information as well as information which indicated that power-frequency fields had significant behavioral and central nervous system effects, as well as a stimulating effect on cancer cell growth. For the Public Service Commission, the results of this study were a real embarrassment. The magnetic field at the edge of the right-of-way (ROW), about fifty feet away from the standard 345 Kv transmission line, averages 100 milliguass. These lines constitute the bulk of the transmission lines in the United States. If a 3-milligauss standard were applied, the ROW around almost all transmission lines would have to be considerably enlarged. In addition, many of the distribution lines (secondaries) generate similar strength fields in adjacent residences, and their power would have to be significantly reduced. The Public Service Commission, in a dizzying flight from reality, set a \"safe\" level of 100 milli gauss, claiming that the public had \"accepted this level of risk\", which was nonsense. The public had been unaware of any risk before these studies became common knowledge, and even after the public was told that while some risks might be present, \"further research was necessary\", a phase that is repeated in countless areas where the health of the public is endangered by irresponsible, irrational, and power-hungry bureaucrats. The public was never asked if it accepted any such risk. An interesting part of this picture is that the govern- ment continually performs studies about the effects of electro magnetic radiation exposure, discovers negative effects, and then ignores the results and denies the studies were ever done, which might be a further indication that sometime way in the last, the \"powers-to-be\" carefully guided the choice of these frequencies to promote the decimation of the population. An interesting thought. In 1986, the Navy entered the picture again. The Office of Naval Research supported an international study, cal led Project Henhouse, to study the effects of ELF pulsed fields. In June of 1988, the results of this study were reported at a meeting of the Bioelectro- magnetics Society. Five of the six laboratories reported that \"apparently, very low-level, very-low-frequency, pulsed magnetic fields contribute to increased abnormality incidence in early embryonic chicks.\" It is clear that magnetic fields as small as 1 milliguass have the potential to produce developmental abnormalities."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"MATRIX III It appears that only two specific functional systems in the organism are primarily influenced by this type of field exposure. These are the brain and the growing tissues of the body, including fetal tissues and cancerous growths. The effects on the brain are mainly functional - for example, behavioral abnormalities, learning disabilities, altered bio- logical cycles, and activation of the stress response system. In growing tissues, field exposure promotes the growth of cancer cells and increases the incidence of developmental defects in newborns. -Other Cases Where Authorities Have Been Not if ied of Hazards and Taken No Act ion In the early 197OSs, Dr. William Morton of the Oregon Health Sciences University was asked by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to look into am excessive incidence of adenocarcinoma among residents of a Portland neighbor- hood that contained an unusual concentration of broadcast towers. The project was expanded to study the relationship between EPA measurements of FM radio fields in Portland and the incidence of several types of cancer found in the same area. A significant relationship was found between field intensity in the FM band and the incidence of non-lymphatic leukemia. The EPA took no action on the report. In 1986, doctors Anderson and Henderson of the Hawaii Department of Health surveyed Honolulu according to census tract areas. They found that in eight out of nine areas containing broadcast towers, the incidence of cancers of all types was significantly higher than in adjacent census tracts that did not have broadcast towers. No action has been taken by the State of Hawaii Department of Health. Modulation is the Secret All of the above reports deal with electromagnetic fields at opposite ends of the non-ionizing portion of the electro- magnetic spectrum. The power-frequency fields oscillate at less than 100 cps, while the microwaves oscillate much faster. It is apparent now that the types of biological effects that are associated with each are virtually identical. Modulation is the secret of transmitting information by means of electromagnetic fields. In microwaves, the high- frequency signal is modulated at low frequencies. Microwaves that are un-modulated have no such effect. The two types of modulation that are biologically important are pulsed modulation and amplitude modulation. In AM radio, for example, the radio receiver \"demodulates\" the signal, removing the \"carrier\" radio-frequency wave, which preserves the modulation that we perceive as voice or music."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 It appears that the human body can also demodulate the signal when exposed to modulated radio-frequency (RF) or microwave fields; the biological effect is that of the low-frequency vibration. All biological effects from electromagnetic radiation are produced by ELF frequencies. The body systems that pick up the electromagnetic signal are \"tuned\" to the natural frequencies between 0 Hz and 30 Hz. These systems will sense abnormal fields that are close to this range (between 30 Hz and 500 Hz). The systems then produce an abnormal effect. Microwave radar pulsed at SO Hz would have the same biologicaleffect as a 60 Hz field alone, which explains the identical effects seen at ELF and microwave frequencies. It also indicates that all intervening frequencies (VLF, AM radio, FM radio and television) will have the same biological effects. Generally speaking, the biological effects from all man-made electromagnetic fields could be categorized as follows: * Effects on growing cells, such as increases in the rate of cancer-cell division. * Increases in the incidence of certain cancers. * Developmental abnormalities in embryos * Alterations in neurochemicals, resulting in behavioral abnormalities, such as suicide, depression, etc. * Alterations in biological cycles. * Stress responses leading to depression in the human immune system. * Alterations in learning ability. According to studies done at the University of Chicago by Dr. Samuel Epstein, since 1975 there have been the follow- ing increases in the incidence of specific types of cancers: Lymphoma, Myeloma, Melanoma 100% Breast Cancer 3 1 % Testicular Cancer 97% Pancreatic Cancer 20% Kidney Cancer 142% Colon Cancer 63% These increases paralle.l the increase in the ambient electromagnetic field in the past ten to fifteen years, and might also relate to the increase in type and quantities of chemicals added to the food, water, and environment.

EFFECTS OF ELF/ULF ON BIOSYSTEMS ELF fields are extremely low frequency magnetic fields with a range of 1 - 100 cps that can affect biological systems. In spite of their weak power ( 2 x 10-9 Telsa per second, compared with a horseshoe magnet which is .I Tesla- per second), they are capable of affecting the human biological system in a most profound way. Human Effects of ELF/ULF In the presence of the protein kinases in the nuclei of the cell, the ELF interacts with the DNA molecule itself. It can \"turn on\" or \"turn off\" any gene, once the correct fre- quency is known. For example, one frequency can cause cancer in a rat in two days. Another can reverse the process. One frequency can cause depression in humans by causing the release of cholinergic neuropeptides in the brain. Still another frequency can cause anxiety; a third can motivate mob behavior, and so forth. It can be done from any point on the planet. The foundation of how ELF can do what it does is that external magnetic fields can control biological spin and proton coupling constants in DNA, RNA, RNA tranferases and hydrons (H20). 0300"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"MATRIX III U.S. Navy Results of ELF Tests ~ccording to the U.S.Navy, which conducted secret testing for seven years (partial results were released in August of 1984), the following effects of E.L.F. have been reproduced i n numerous 1 aboratory tests, repeated1 y : 1.Alteration of the behavior of cells, tissues, organs, and organisms. 2.Alteration of hormone levels. 3.Alteration of cellular chemistry. 4.Alteration of time perception in animals and humans. 5.Induction of sleep in animals. 6.1nhibition or enhancement of bone growth. 7.Inhibition or enhancement of cell differentiation. 8.Inhibition or enhancement of protein kinase production. 9.Inhibition or enhancement of M(RNA) synthesis/processes. 10.Alteration of the immune system processes. 11.Alteration of the calcium bonding and efflux in cells. 12.Destruction and rupture of cellular structure. 13.Entrainment of human and animal brainwaves. 14.Entrainment of the DNA transaction process. 15.Cause defects and alterations in embryos. 16.Cause accelerated fetal mortality rates. # 17.Cause sterility. 18.Promote non-invasive genetic engineering by causing the production of auto-adjusting antibodies that will cause the generation of viruses within the body. 19.Cut-e of diseases by alteration of cellular frequencies."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"MATRIX III ADDITIONAL ELF CAPABILITIES Much of the work on Ultra-low-frequencies was done and continues to be done by the Navy and Dr. Jose Delgado in Spain has produced an additional list of capabilities that are in the hands of the military and intelligence agencies: 20.Creation of fatigue states. 21.Creation of state of depression. 22.Creation of cataracts and eye problems. 23.Creation of irritability and anger states. 24.General alteration of moods. 25 .Creation of compulsive -behavior patterns. 26.Creation of states of sexual aggressiveness. 27.Creation of havoc in circadian rhythms. 28.Creation of fear and disorientation. 29.Creation of sleep disorders and insomnia. 3O.Creation periods of short and long-term memory loss. 31.Creation of leukemia and cancer. 32.Creation of catatonic (zombie-like) states (15 min). 33.Creation of violent states and criminal behavior patterns.

They are asymmetric harmonic pulsations of the geomagnetic field. 2. Artificial ELF'S: Artificial ELFs are created by the man- made electromagnetic grid, which consists of power lines, industrial electric sources, appliances, etc. The penetrat- ing power of these ELF waves is directly proportional to their amplitude (voltage and power). They decrease in power (attenuate) inversely as tre square of the distance from the source. They do not carry programmed information. 3. Tactical ELFs: Tactical ELF waves are created by tele- vision, radio, communications, radar, microwave, cellular telephone, etc. The power range is usually in the Megawatt (millions of cycles per second) or Gigawatt (billions of cycles per second). These ELFs (magnetic components of the transmissions) do carry information and are modulated at 16-20 Hz and at classified modulation rates. Carriers are very often in the FM range (147 -160 MHz) but also in other frequencies not generally known to the public. Both the type of modulation and the fact that \"frequency hopp- ing\" occurs is not generally known by the public. These ELF magnetic waves can penetrate anything. Attempts to stop the waves using Faraday cages has been unsuccessful. A possible solution is to create a neutralizing pulsing magnetic field to counteract the pulsing magnetic fields comprising the ELF. Based on the above information and our research on the matter, it is concluded that the chemical and germ warfare prosed by Colonel Tom Bearden was not the real threat to the American public from the Russians. The real threat was in the Tactical ELF emanations from the Russians and the United States government. Research appears to indicate that the phenomenology of ELFs and Scalar Wave technology is almost identical.

The recognition and validation of these effects would mean the collapse of the entire military (and industrial) electromagnetic capabilities of command, control and communications. It quickly became apparent that evidence for non-thermal effects was viewed as a threat to \"national security\". This view led to the policy of denying any non- thermal effects from any electromagnetic usage, whether military or civilian. Control over the scientific establish- ment was maintained by allocating research funds in such a way as to ensure that only \"approved\" projects (that would not challenge the thermal-effects standard) would be undertaken. Science as a field has always been a bit reactionary, and this tendency was capitalized upon by the military by en- listing the support of prominent members of the engineering and biological professions to support this deception. In some instances, scientists have been told that non-thermal effects did occur, but that national security objectives required that they be hidden from public knowledge. The personal goals of many scientists were subverted by promises of unlimited fund- ing from the military and easy access under \"classified\" programs to scientific literature not made available to the public or mainstream scientists. Because of this collusion, when serious challenges to the thermal-effects standard were raised publicly, eminent scientific boards, associations, or foundations were provided with lucrative \"contracts\" to \"evaluate\" the state of know- ledge of the bioeffects of EM fields. These \"investigations\" resulted in the production of voluminous \"reports\". The practice is still going on. All these \"reports\" seem to share certain characteristics. Scientific data indicating non-thermal bioeffects is either ignored or subjected to extensive and destructive review. Scientists (even Nobel prize nominees) who reported the existence of non-thermal effects were ridiculed and were portrayed as being outside the mainstream of thought. Actual disinformation was used to create a false impression. For example, while a statement such as \"there is no evidence for any effects of pulsed magnetic fields on humans\" might be true for the person making the statement, data reporting such effects on animals would be ignored and tests on humans would never be sanctioned through regular scientific channels, but would be performed under the scrutiny of DARPA or covert scientific groups having close connections with the Navy or intelligence factions, who would be conducting such research for nefarious purposes.

So, he turned the entire issue over and threw out the scientific aspects and cited elements within Washington State law that would allow them to put up the tower. We \"lost\", but we really had them worried. Other groups in the state are doing them same thing about towers in their areas. You will understand the depth of why the cellular companies were so concerned when we get into Part I1 of this chapter. The Ground- Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) System The Ground-Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) is a communications system that the military is in the process of constructing as we speak. It operates in the very-low- frequency (VLF) range, with transmissions between 150 and 175 kHz. This range was selected because its signals travel by means of waves that have a tendency to hug the ground rather than by radiating into the atmosphere. This signal drops off sharply with distance - a single GWEN stations transmits in a 360 circle to a distance of 250 to 300 miles. The entire GWEN system consists of approximately 300 such stations spread across the United States, each with a tower 300-500 feet high. The stations are from 200 to 250 miles apart, so that a signal can go from coast to coast from one station to another. When the system is completed around 1993, the entire civilian population of the United States will be exposed to the GWEN transmissions.

During this period, there were a lot of protests, sit- ins and demonstrations by Greenpeace and many other groups against the deployment of Cruise missiles, especially at Greenham Common, which was south of where I was located. In 1983 and 1984 there was a very large presence of military police at the base when the Cruise missiles arrived. Around mid-1984 this presence diminished considerably, and some of the protesters who were outside the base started claiming that they were being irradiated from the base because of physical problems they were unable to link to any other source. This was reported in Electronics Today magazine in 1985. The symptoms ranged from skin burns to headaches, drowsiness, menstrual bleeding at abnormal times, bouts of temporary paralysis, faulty speech coordination, and in one case circulatory failure severe enough to require hospitalization. Such a complex series of symptoms fits well with severe EM field exposure. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) denied that any harmful electromagnetic signal was being used against the women, but did not deny that an electromagnetic signal may be in use which, if below 10mW/cm2, would not, under UK guide- ines, be officially acknowledged as harmful.

The project was funded by the Atomic Energy commission at a cost of $1.5 million. From 1945 to 1947, 18 hospital patients, one of them only five years old, were injected with plutonium to measure how much the body would retain. The injections were represented as \"experimental treatments\" for the patients' illnesses.

The Psycho logy Beh ind Mind Contro 7 and Psychic Warfare Body identification gives rise to a host of sociological phenomena, the least of which is the mechanistic view that consciousness is a product of the brain, and secondarily that the mind is centered in the brain. Dr. Jose Delgado was one of the chief proponents of this viewpoint. Delgado was the author of the book \" Physica 7 Control of the Mind: Toward a Psychocivilized Society\". For Delgado, the mind existed only in the brain; to postulate its existence as an independent entity was to him sheer nonsense. He rejected the concept of free will, and proposed that the mind was a functional entity produced by the electrical operations of the brain, and as such should be manipulated and controlled in order to control the behavior of the population. This was a view that seems to be shared by proponents of the New World Order. Delgado, since the mid-1970's, was the director of the Spanish neurophysio- logical laboratory Centro Ramon y Cajal. As time went on, his"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 interests shifted from direct stimulation of the brain to the broader area of the biological effects of electromagnetic fields, an area that has been eagerly embraced by the military and political system as a means to achieve their goal of absolute control of the population. There are several psychological schools of thought that have been adopted by government psycho-scientists and the military to justify mind control. All of them relate to the idea of psychic energy as originating in the human psyche, typified by the work of Carl Jung. The energy originating in the human psyche consists of thoughts, feelings, emotions, and neuro-physiological stimuli and responses. It consists of a physical component that can be measured and an etheric hyper- spacial component that can only be measured by specialized equipment. These schools of thought are as follows: . Suppression of Vita7 Data in Physics SCHOOL For thousands of years, many discoveries have been suppressed from the populations of the planet in order to keep them in bondage. The burning of the libraries of Alexandria is one example of how information can be suppressed. Another example would be the common technique of suppression of scientific information by alteration of the information itself. Perhaps the most blatant and far reaching alteration of data was the alteration of Maxwell's equations. James Clerk Maxwell was a mathematical genius who lived in the late 19th century. His original work, which is available to covert scientific departments in the government, had the potential to 0309 R E / C H /A A? 1 F R E U DlAU (513 rnund FICvs) J uu G /A hl (Car? tube JG~s) ADL ER /A ( t#,d mr ) 6 E S 7A L T So- gl %wcxir err.^ rr in me SEXUAL OCUH .

It is certainly clear to most of you by now that the human population can easily manipulated by electronic means using various methods developed through the military industrial complex. What may not be clear to you is that many of the EM effects can be initiated from outside of what is normally seen as the electromagnetic spectrum. Just as a magnetic field in a wire is at right angles to the current flow, other fields and waveforms exist that are an integral part of the electromagnetic spectrum, yet exist at a certain number of right-angle rotations (orthogonal rotations) away from the electromagnetic field components we are normally accustomed to. If these hyperspacial components, which are not subject to the usual electromagnetic constraints of time and space, are generated and manipulated, they can in turn generate EM effects that have the capability to influence human bi 01 ogy and consciousness. Let's take a brief look at how and by whom the equations of Maxwell were changed, in order to make subsequent open scientific development that would have influenced civilization in a positive way, impossible: The Hertzian Conspiracy In late 1864, James Clerk Maxwell published his epic material on electromagnetic waves. His material dealt not only with electrical and magnetic waves, but also the relativ- .istic/etherial psycho-active component of these waves (repre- senting electromagnetics of the second order and above). The equations also included transformations that enabled the change from inertial frames of reference to non-inertial frames of reference. Maxwell's original equations were written in Quaternion notation, a complex mathematical system available at that time before Vector Analysis was introduced by Oliver Heaviside. Today's generalized equivalent of Quaternions is Tensors. In short, Maxwell's original work gave the necessary information for gravitational propulsion and psychoactive devices. Someone somewhere recogni zed this, for short1 y after his death, the mathematician Oliver Heaviside, the chemist Willard Gibbs, and physicist Heinrich Hertz decided to \"edit\" or \"interpret\" Maxwells famous equations which were, in the original form,. the foundations of electromagnetics and Unified Field Theory (UFT). This \"unholy trio\", especially Heaviside, disregarded the Quaternions or Scalar components of Maxwells' original equations, because they represented potentials and not fields. He thought potentials were akin to \"mysticism\", because \"everybody knows that fields contain mass, and mass cannot be created from apparently nothing.\", which is what"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"MATRIX III potentials are, both literally and mathematically; they are an accumulation or reservoir of energy. Furthermore, not only did they throw away the gravitational component with the Quatern- ion/Scalar, but also postulated that gravitation and electro- magnetism were mutually exclusive, not interdependent. That was the death blow to subsequent efforts by scientists to realize a functioning unified field theory. Because of this one act, electromagnetism was reduced from its original five dimensions to only four: X, Y, Z, and time. The element of G was removed. Because of this deliberate act, twenty-two other errors exist today in electromagnetic theory. The very concepts of force, mass and charge are ill-defined, and the so-called \"static\" electrical charge has been discovered by Quantum mechanics not to be static at all, but to move rotationally by virtue of the quantum mechanical spin. Finally, adding insult to injury, the so-called \"-imaginary components\" of Maxwells original equations as we1 1 as the mutilated version of the equations have also been discarded or ignored. With this last error, the door to hyperspacial domains was forever closed, for the present mathematics and physics of electromagnetic theory do not allow for hyperspacial domains (domains out- side of three dimensions), superluminal signals (signals that exceed the speed of light or are infinite in speed), and a unified field theory. The edited version of Maxwells work, which every physicist and engineer has had to contend with, discards electrogravitation, and avoids the unification of gravitation and electromagnetics. It also prevents the direct engineering of gravitation, space-time, time flow rates, free energy devices, and quantum changes, which is viewed by the altered equations that are vector-based as only a statistical change. The quaternion approach captures the ability to utilize electromagnetics and produce local curvature of spacetime. Heaviside wrote a subset of Maxwell's equations where this capability is excluded. Dr. Henry Monteith has independently discovered that Maxwell's original quaternion theory was a unified field theory. Einstein assumed, because he only had access to the altered equations, that curving spacetime could only be achieved by the weak gravitational f'orce due to mass, that the local frame would always be a Lorentz frame, which would mean that all operations would be constrained to \"conservation laws of physics\". In the 1960's the Hertz (Hz) replaced Cycles Per Second. Since, then everyone thinks that a11 electromagnetic waves are hertzian. Only the upper portion of the spectrum before Infra- red contains Hertzian waves. ELF and ULF are not; waves in biosystems and natural phenomena are not Hertzian in nature; 03 11"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 they are asymmetrical and non-linear. The heartbeat, pulse and brainwaves are non-Hertzian, yet are affected by Hertzian RF waves. That is the paradox that is perceived by orthodox scientists. Maxwells original equations consisted of two parts representing both measurable components and the relativistic components. The relativistic or etherial component is hyperspacial and is also called the \"imaginary\" or \"complex conjugate\", and signals using this component are psycho- active; they interact with the brain and consciousness. Government scientists, who discovered the errors and the original equations of Maxwell, made sure that these errors remained uncorrected outside government research circles. The mutilated version of Maxwells work represents the physics that is taught in all universities - only the government has access to the \"real\" physics, which ironically has hyperspacial or \"imaginary\" components. All orthodox electronic and scientific instrumentation outside classified government laboratories has been designed to measure force, electrical charge, and energy that is coupled to mass. Subtle energies where mass is not involved cannot be detected, much less measured - hence it doesn't exist. Even the hyperspacial components of voltage, current, and power within alternating currents cannot be measured by standard instruments, yet it is these very so-called \"imaginary components\" of voltage, current, and power that co- exist with the \"real\" components and affect the psychic and neurological functions of biosystems. This is (was) perhaps one of the best kept secrets of the government. Now it's yours. As a result of all this, orthodox scientists, academicians, and engineers continue to sleep to the stupefying \"song and dance tunes\" of their Nobel prize laurels, discovering man-made new sub-atomic particles in their quantum mechanical \"zoo of confusion\". Meanwhile, relativistic physics, or hyperphysics, remains only a remote possibility relegated to imaginary or mystic realms, which is where Prana, C'hi, and subtle energies exist. Even such quan- tum mechanical concepts, such as the zero-point energy of vacuum and the Di rac Sea, the source of a1 1 virtual particles of negative energy (particles that do not yet exist in mass that are the potential source for all forms of free energy) do not exist for them. So much for todays orthodox science.

The Orion Techno logy Report in Appendix 4 contains supplementary informat ion that relates to this report. X: Let 's move a long to things that are psycho-act ive in nature and things that people shou7d know about. Y: We now have discussed the early Phoenix Project. In about 1969 they wrote the final report for Phoenix I. In that report it stated that \"since we now have studied the e7ectromagnet ic effects on human beings, we be1 ieve it is now possib7e to inf luence the way people think with e lectromagnet ics \". Of course when Congress read the report, they hit the cei 1 ing, saying essentia77y, \"we'donJt want you doing this!\". Congress was afraid that someone wou7d use this techno7ogy to contro7 them. They said, in effect, \"no, don't do this.\". The people who wanted to continue this went to the mi 7 itary and said, in effect, \"we can make you a nice 7 itt 7e weapon that wi 7 7 make the enemy 7ay down their arms.\" How many peop7e be7ieve that the military doesn't want this? The mi 1 itary then offered them the use of the o 7d base at Montauk. Then came Phoenix 11 and the Montauk project. Let's review that. They had three steps in the project. The first step in the project was something I 7 ike to ca7 7 the \"microwave oven\" step. They wanted to see what the output of the mu7ti-gigawatt transmitter wou7d have on human beings in front of it. They took a subject and sat them in where they cou7d be focused on and threw the switch. Of course, the subjects were cooked. We don't know how many peop7e they kil led this way, but we do know there were a 70t of them. Finally, someone got the idea, \"hey, we don't want the burning rays, we want the non-hertzian rays\". They turned the antenna around and they aimed the gain horn through the ref lector at the target person. Now they were getting some- where. They were able to direct mood contro7 from a distance by ELF modulating the transmitter and changing the mood. This was a great success. Someone then came to them from the US Governmen-t and told them that they wou7d provide them with sensors that wou7d pick up thoughts direct 7y from a persons ' mind. So, they brought the system of sensors and insta77ed them in a chair. This is the famous Montauk chair."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 What they did then is that they connected the output of the sensors to computers that would decode the sensors output into a dig i ta 7 code that represented the thought pat terns. Those went to another computer which would store the thought patterns and to another computer which would generate the pulse modulations that went out the antenna. What they had actua77y built was a mind amplifier. X: What would they do with this chair? Y: They would take a subject, train him so that his conscious mind would be diverted to the \"serpent in the Kunda 7 ini \". The primitive mind would come up to the surface - they would blank that out and put in his primitive mind a concept that he would concentrate on. The concept would be picked by the sensors and transmitted out of the antenna. This was the second phase of Montauk. They were targeting who le popu lat ions and individ- ua 7s. The subject cou 7d think of sque lching e lectrica 7 activity and a1 7 activity would stop where they focused the antenna . X: What else where they able to do? Y: They were able to change the way in which the animals in the area were moving. Once they programmed the animals to charge out of the woods into the town. They changed the way birds flew,. fish swam and a dozen other things. They could take the crime statistics in Montauk and run it up and down like a yo-yo. They programed crime waves for one period where they would occur for four hours each night for a week. This drove the police crazy. There was one time, according to the Montauk po 1 ice, when a 7 7 the kids descended on the beach - a 7 1 the kids in town. Two or three hours later, the kids a1 7 left the beach in mass unison. Another time, a71 the residents of the town decided to drive up to the state park. When asked, some of them said that it seemed like a \"good thing to do\". X: So what they had deve loped was . . . Y: They developed wholly operational mind control. Based upon the effect that they had to cancel out the fields at the chair, which was located underground, they not iced that conceptual effects would happen out of synch with real time. They realized that they had the capabi 7 ity of bending time. At that point, conferences were held to discuss how they would modify the equipment to more effect ive7y bend time. They developed something called a Delta-T antenna. It consisted of three loops describing a delta-funct ion; it was referred to as the pyramid antenna. It essent ia 7 ly was three magnetic pickups/transmitters at right angles to each other; three orthogona 1 7oops. Orthorotat ion is, of course, how you get access to hyperspace.

The output of the chair went into a Cray computer that would decode the digital representation of the thoughtform. That drove the IBM computer and the output from that went into the AIL computer.. . X: AIL? Is that the Airborne Instrument Labs? Y: Yes. The AIL computer generated the pulse modulation. It was a frequency-hopping signa 7 source. It would change frequencies in a matter of nano-seconds. There were five synchro-dyne gmp1 ifier stages, cascaded. Each one had a separate pulse modulator. The f ina 1 input was the ampl itron, which had a big pulse modulator. X: How did this thing work? Y: They would take a port ion of the thought form and put it into the first stage, and pulse the first stage on and load it into the second stage,etc. After the fifth stage it would go into the IPA's, be pulsed again and then into the ampl itron, which would be pulsed and then the signa 1 would go into the above ground antenna. Each time the signa 1 would go from stage to stage, more complex informat ion would be put into the thoughtform that was being cycled through. What does a 7 7 this remind us of? The radiosonde. This is essentially a big .radiosonde . X: How did they figure the time aspect into a77 of this? Y: They used the delta-t antenna, which was situated underground immediate ly under the chr istmas-tree antenna on top of the bui lding. The chair was located underground between the de 1 ta-t antenna and the above-ground antenna. The de 1 ta-t C generated time-stress tensors which were coupled with the electric field to generate the full time tensor control. It was great. They had a working time machine. They used twistor and spinor fields in order to form a porta 7. They could go anywhere in space-time, and they used it once to get access to the underground fac i 1 it Yes on Mars. X: To Mars? How did that work? Y: First, the subject projected h imse 1 f psych ica 7 ly through space to Mars. They set the computers to so 7 idi fy the vortex between Montauk and the point on Mars and the vortex would be established.

It was a directive of the peop 1e in command at Montauk to phys ica 1 1y and psych ica 1 1y approach this defense mechanism, in order to find a way to turn the system off. It was done. If it were turned back on, the system would in effect become more \"conscious\" and able to reject outside intrusion. X: I 'm not sure I understand what you are rea 7 ly ta 1k ing about with a77 this ... does it have anything to do with the p 7anetary grid? Y: Yes, to a degree. There are planetary grid nodes on almost every mi 7 itary base. What we're talking about with the earth is putting the earth to sleep in order to prevent any geo 709 ica 7 changes of any great magn i tude from occurring. We 're pumping signa 1s into the grid points, which you might compare to human chakras. It is mind control, in a way, that is a lso being done to the planetary mind of the earth. X: What has happened since the Montauk project crashed in 1983? Y: Well, after the Montauk project was discovered and ITT was taken apart, the government didn't leave it alone. They 7eft ELF a lone and they moved up to VLF through HF today. HF is 3-30MHz, MF is 300KHz to 3Mhz and VLF is 3KHZ to 300KHz. If you tune across these spectrums, you are going to hear a17 sorts of pu lse modulated signa 7s that sound 1 ike the old Montauk signa 1s. You' 7 7 hear signa 1s simi lar but not ident ica 7 to the Soviet woodpecker signals; you'll hear video buzzes on these bands- they don't have synch or chromo references on them. On VLF, you can tune into 15.75KHz horizontal rate and you hear phase modulation. I have receiving equipment that has dispersive IF filters that convert phase modulation to amplitude modulation so I can hear it. A17 your TV networks - the Nat iona 1 Bureau of Standards (NBS) supp 1 ies free-of-charge the reference frequency to a 7 7 TV stat ions. This is what they phase modu late. Does anyone be 1 ieve the government gives anything away for nothing? I just discovered that this is part of the videodrome system. I have been tracking this for quite a while and wondered what it was. If you tune up to 31.4 KHz, which is twice the horizontal rate, and up to other multiples of the horizontal rate, you* 7 7 find other carriers which are similar to video but don't have the synch informa- tion accompanying them; they correlate to the horizontal rate and the phase modulation. In the Long Island area, these carriers are coming from the state parks. There are little VLF transmitter sites in the state parks; they are a 7 1 run from sate7 1 ite.

The \"American Buzzsaw\" is the US equiva 7ent of the Russian wood-pecker s igna 1. This a psycho-act ive signa 7 which is designed to interface with the mind of the human being by way of the mind-bra in connect ion. The government has been quite active, designing systems that are carried by he7 icopter, systems that sit on the ground like the buzzsaw transmitters, etc. I first picked up the buzzsaw signal about 1990. I ca77ed the FCC and asked them if they knew what it was. They said it was the American version of the over-the-horizon radar. I sa id, \"you mean 7 ike the Russian wood-pecker s igna l?\". They said \"yes\". So they admitted that it had the same purpose. This signa 7 is broadcasted on mu lt ip 7e carriers. The carriers hop from one frequency to another, anywhere in the range from 4MHz to 3DMHz. It is never on the ham band or the inter- nat iona 7 broadcast band. It is on 7y on the a 7 located frequencies that the government shares with other communication services. With the switching of these frequencies, they are creating what is known as a Levinson Transform, named after Norman Levinson, who generated the mathemat ics for frequency-t ime transformat ions. This is high 1y significant, since the human brain, body and mind work on time dependent pulsations and frequencies which are time en- coded. You have th is unusua 7 pu 7se modu 7ated s igna 1 hopping around from frequency to frequency to frequency. They have multip7e transmitter. The signals only come in phase at a targeted site. This s igna 7, we be 7 ieve, has three modes. The first mode is the search-mode. This is where they transmit a s igna 7 and then a psych ica 77y sensitive human being picks up the signa 7 and sends something back. They can in this way identify these peop 7e and where they are. The second mode is the genera 7 transmiss ion of a psychic interrupt function wh ich interrupts psychic activity. That's a7 7 it does. It has a tendency to lower the overall psychic awareness of the population. Maybe one out of three peop 7e respond to this s igna 7. A good psychic can eas i 7y screen this mode out of their consciousness. The third mode is where they target an individua 7, and we have known six peop 7e who have been targeted. They can lock on to the resonance of the synthetic material in your clothing and target you from that. We have a clearing device which uses the equivalent of a white-noise magnetic f ield to break up the magnetic matrix in objects in order to c7ear any psychic signatures or stored solitons in the object. We put this device on the clothing, and you could hear the timing of the buzz-saw changing. It got more and more distorted, and then disappeared for a while; it then came back in on the search mode. This is te 7 7 ing me that it is an . interactive signa 7. Also, if I scan up and down the band, it wi 7 1 find my receiver and lock in on that receiver.

Y: We 1 7, i f there was a process be ing imp inged on a person that embodied a higher intelligence than the person had, at a higher power leve 7 than the person manifested, you could say that he was under control. There could be emot iona 1 or physical indication that something was \"out of order\". Typ ica 7 ly, we a 7 7 know when someth in9 is wrong. You have to be in touch with how you operate in a normal manner in order to distinguish when something abnormal is going on. You have to have a high order of awareness in order to recognize when an attempt is being made to violate your mind. Understanding how it works is probably your best defense against this, at this point. We have no shield, per se, no real way to jam it, but understanding does limit its effect by a7 lowing you to \"plug the holes\" in your mentality. A technological device that would block it would have to go above the wave-order that embodies the human being. It would have to be a unified field type of device in order to be above the orthogonal rotations in hyperspace that they are using to transmit the effect. If ,you can persona 7 1y operate within those higher orders, in consciousness, you can contro 7 what is going on around you, barring the use of a techno7ogica1 device. Another aspect is that if you operate \"outside of time\" in consciousness, then t ime-dependent hyperspac ia 1 pu lsed modu lat ions wou 1d have little or no effect. The people that are perpetrating this 'stuff want you to be unaware - that's why they're sending out the buzz-saw signals. The awareness that it is going on is .by a 7 1 means a major step. X: How about the use of sub7 imina 1s in the environment? Y: There are doors to different levels within the \"sub- conscious\" areas of the mind that are keyed in by the focus of attent ion and the integrat ion of emot ion. For instance, the third and forth level of the subconscious involves sexua 7 ity. Advertising and media focus on this subject should not be an area of focus. It is a 'jumping off point\" to get into the mind. X: Are these \"searching functions\" directed toward specific areas, or do they cover the entire country.. . is there somewhere you could go to establish a safe reference point? Y: Well, from the way I have heard it, there are at least five mu 7 ti- megawatt transmitters propagating these buzz-saw signa 7s. There are also many 7oca 7 transmitters a 17 over the country.

If you live deep underground, you probably would not even pick the signal up. X: How deep would that have to be? Y: Probab 7y a mi 1e or so underground b ju 1d be enough. If you lived in a ring of mountains, they might not find you. See, this is not a time-stress that they are playing with. They don't need special equipment to do this now. X: What do you mean? Y: They need no more than the UHF ce1 lular telephone 8 frequency, which is now being insta 7 led everywhere, to do it. The human cranium resonates within the frequencies covered by ce 17u 7ar telephone continuous wave transmissions. The ce7 lular system nationwide is connected to a computer system in Boulder, Colorado. We are very suspicious about what other capabilities that system has, since it is pulse modulated. That is not a relativistic signa 1 - it is a hertzian in-domain type signal and it affects the physica 7. We suspect that they may be using the ce 7 lu lar telephone receivers to pick up the return signal from the buzz-saw. We have heard buzz-saw 7 ike signa 7s on the ce 1 lular telephone network that correspond in frequency-switch-timing in the same way that the buzz-saw signa 7s do. There is a definite connect ion between ce 17ular telephones and the buzz-saw signa 7. And this is \"over-the- horizon radar\" that connects to cellular telephones?

Y: You have different kind of grid nodes. The Hartman 1 ines are every 1.5 feet. The mil itary bases are bui7t on the large nodes where the lines repeat about every 15 to 20 mi 7es.

Y: There is research that shows that the human cranium resonates at about 850MHz; this seems to vary from about 830MHZ to 890MHz. The cel lular system is designed to operate right in that range. The cel lular system operates from about lf\" q\\ 840MHz to 890MHz. It is pulse amp 7 itude modulated and pulsed , Y \\k \"angle modulated. X: Angle. That would be phase. Y: Right. You have regular analog modulation as well. When your portable cel lular system is ON, it's in constant communication with the cell site. The set that you are carrying is te7ling the cell site where you are. When you get to the edge of the cell site it transfers you over to another cell site. They can also use this to track the people as well. Is that the only way to tr'ack? Y: It is conceivab 7e that they could track a person by the ringing within the cranial cavity. I do not know if they can do that yet. It is theoretically possible. Each persons cranium shou 7d \"ring\" with a different resonant signature. X: What about the interface with this central computer for the cel lu7ar system. Could you go into more detai 7 about that? Y: The cellular system involves their use of a person they dubb a \"roamer\", which is a person who roams the country with a cellular transceiver. He has to be able to hand over from cell site to cell site as he trave7s. The only way a roamer can operate over the entire country is for the system to be tied into a central computer that keeps track of everything.

They are part of the network and they are a 1 1 7 inked e lectronica 1 ly. X: Is this a7 7 control led by the mi 7 itary? Y: Sure. From what I understand, the master computer for the cellular system is in Boulder, Colorado. I don't think I have to te 17 you what e 1se is in Boulder. X: The center of the buzz-saw. Y: Yes.

X: Is it pulse or phase modulated? Y: It appears to be phase modulated. X: Have you been ab 7e to de-modulate this videodrome signa 7? Y: Yes. It's coming right over the television at people. X: Most of the instrumentat ion in electronics is constructed to measure a charge couple to mass - the \"real\" component of the signa 1. How do you go about measuring the complex conjugate component of the signal which is psycho-active - the re 1at ivist ic port ion of the signa 1. Y: That's not an easy task to do. The on ly way I know to measure such a s igna 1 is by measuring through the zero-point potent ia 7 using an o 1d-style regenerative receiver as a detector, because then you have the positron-electron pairs coup 7 ing through the vacuum and your re 1at ivist ic funct ions will affect the coupling between the positron-electron pairs. X: Is there a practical test that someone without access to a lot of instrumentation can use? Y: Essentia77y, you can use any detector system. But a77 the detectors other than the regenerative type require a corre7ated hertzian function in order to pump the detector for it to detect the non-hertzian component or function. This is what makes a vacuum tube short wave receiver not fade the way others do. Its detecting the non-hertzian function, but not direct 7y. If you move the hertzian part of the signa 7 completely, your receiver just drops out to complete dis- tort ion because a 7 1 you're getting is the de 7ta pulses that come through the Dirac sea into the receiver. A regenerative detector can integrate those Dirac pulses into a usable function. If you had a white noise source pump a diode, you could hear the modulations in the white noise source. The problem is, how are you going to hear a delta pulse on the speaker in the audio amp? You have to somehow cross-feed the delta pu7se to give you something that is usable."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 r $THEMATICAL b GEOMETRICAL MOOEL OF EARTH CRIOS(VORTECES,LfY LINES) LONGlrVPC GIID ~IYCL(~-~) LATI IUOL Gun ltuo (Ek) \"I \"a AW= # I I x- 1-1 O~~wounr P~OZCCT~W of Gem 1,ucs ON 'FIAr'PLANG OK Eh.Lfll3 SURMC6.

The Crysta 17 ine Stucture of the Bra in EMC HEADQUARTERS - CPU Access to Nervous System via Electromagnetics AT&T FCC NBS The mind of the human is a mind within a Mind, a membrane within a' Membrane, a cell within a Cell. These holographic aspects reflect the functioning network of the Universal Intelligent Matrix, which enfolds within itself various mind structures throughout the latticework of manifestation. There is a photonic (light) movement through this network on a stepped dimensional basis. Each individual human mind is situated at harmonic points on an inter-dimensional gridwork. Each area of mind interpenetrates a physical brain. The brain can be seen as a liquid crystalline resonanting organic structure which grounds the mind. As the mind interpenetrates the brain, different anatomical structures resonate with and ground particular aspects of the mind's functioning. > There are four separate resonating systems within the human head - the sensory cortex, the right and left hemispheres, the third and lateral ventricles, and the skull. 0339 \\ - ELF-ULF/ Non-Hertzian Modulated Information Instructions, Commands Protocol s, Actions UHF-VHF CARRIER Real & Hyperspacial I Components m 4 I L HF - \"BUZZSAW\" Search/Locate Interrupt Target Sensitives P 1 JOE CITIZEN \"Modified\" Controlled and the Ideal Citizen Never Questions Anything"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 All these are areas where pulsating magnetic fields of opposite polarities are set up, these being very sensitive to environmental fields. These pulsating magnetic fields provide a resonance-based method of retrieving information from the environment via resonant feedback. Each of the four areas has a function which acts as a separate reception/amplification area for different aspects of the universal frequency spectrum. The actual structure of neural material, again, can be seen as a magnetically and gravitationally oriented liquid crystal1 colloidal matrix. Within this general structure, there exist magnetic and gravitational domains that appear to have a distinct relationship with the mind centers and the energy channels. Holographically coded energy patterns are focalized within the primary mind centers and then mirrored within the brain matrix along various quantum-based holographically oriented axial networks. Waveforms originating with the various domains form standing wave interference patterns which represent information that is encoded into memory-linked membrane structures within the brain tissue. Bear with me a little longer, here. The brain can be viewed simply as a biocrystalline receiver and amplifier. It represents the master control, as it were, for a11 aspects of biological functioning and is the principle area in which and through which there is a continuous inter-dimensional connection and resonance. The brain-mind combination selectively received and trans- duces higher level input through a series of highly sensitive tensors, which could be compared to microscopic antennae, millions of which form energy templates at various dimensional thresholds within the dynamics of the neural structure. These cilia-like antennae function as threshold membranes for the processing of thought-form and other energy fields in an all-or-nothing fashion. The coded configuration, realized through Fourier translation, of any given energy field has a corresponding holographic/hyperspacial stress/no-stress pattern. These tensor templates transduce and step down the input into lower dimensional modalities. At the level of the physical brain, these tensors manifest themselves as villia, cilia and spherical bodies lining the various brain ventricles. The tiny villi on the inside of the cerebral cavities act as \"cathode\" and \"anode\" structures and cause the brain to become a resonating radiating vehicle of an enhanced wave-field. We will examine some other aspects of thought reception, but first it would be prudent to take a look at the actual process where thought wave patterns, in this case represented by Theta (O), manifest themselves into mass. This will greatly expand your understanding of this approach to thought-wave quantum mechanics; much of it requires an expanded understanding of consciousness."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 5YNIff ROhflClTY :'he Pr+k Brhind'PSYl~lC PHENOMENA\" ' 1,72e &*-Pnuli Connetion :QcrmT;m Me&,& 4 7fic Psy* E!aJ , *# Ibr.~+d S~cd ri uniicd $id.

It then sets up resonances in the five sections of the cranial bone plate. A five-fold standing wave pattern of B-lowered Tachyons (T) interacts with the liquid crystal structure of the brain. That part of the brain structure that matches the frequency of the vibrating Tachyons will respond via harmonic resonance. The ~akhyons, which enfold energy, will provide Deltons, which in turn create ante-matter and matter simultaneously. Electrons are formulated and an electric pulse flows, giving rise to a perceived thought. The human'brain is a masterpiece of sacred geometry, chemistry, alchemy and structural engineering. It is constructed in five major hard bone plates interconnected by cartilaginous membranes, callled fontanellas, that allow subtle lateral motion and non-linear complex vibrations to take place. The cranium (skull) is a superb transducer of linear and non-linear complex vibrations. Complex vibrations can also be called conjugate, in that they have both three- dimensional and hyperspacial components. Now, this is important. The natural resonant vibrational frequency of the cranium is in the range of 840-890 MHz in non-hertzian vibration. Unfortunately, an externally applied hertzian wavefront of 840-890 MHz can and does make the cranium undergo resonance due to entrainment.

With the adequate modilations of RF and microwaves they can induce vibrations in the cranium, access the neural lattice in the brain, and implant \"thoughts\" via ELF/ULF. Thus, individuals so impacted (unless they really know themselves on a deep level) think it is their own thoughts they are perceiving. VARIOUS VIEWS OF THE CRANIAL CAVITY Below, we have an illustration showing various views of the cranial cavity which houses the brain. Notice the geometry is not a sphere, but resembles an oblate spheroid. This same configuration is, by the rules of sacred geometry, a function of the constants PI and PHI. This assymetry is associated with a resonant cavity capable of enfolding a unified field. The actual process of transduction of Theta waves (0) involves the ionic crystalline structure of the calcium bone in the cranium.

D. ABSTRACT This article will briefly review the evidence for a biological role for non-~ertzian fields and present recent experimental evidence (obtained by the author and other non-orthodox scientists) to support the hypothesis that they are a likely component of the bio-energy body and are involved with the body's own intrinsic healing mechanisms. The crystalline transduction theory is presented as a new theory to explain how exogenous non- Hertzian fields are utilized by the body to bring about profound changes at the cellular level resulting in facilitation of the healing process. In addition, the Information Matrix Theory is discussed as a mechanism to explain the interaction with non- Hertzian fields with the atomic nucleus. These theories are based on contemporary scientific research from quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics and bioelectromagnetics. This multidisciplinary approach may form the basis for a new branch of science referred to as quantum biology. NON-HERTZIAN FIELDS The umbrella term non-Hertzian will be utilized here to reference a type of subtle energy which for the last ninety years has been reported in the literature as radiant energy (Moray), morphogenic fields, empty fields, motional fields (Hooper), time reversed waves, longitudinal standing waves and ttscalarw waves. Other terms like chi, healing energy, bioplasma and orgone energy refer to energy which may also be non-Hertzian or a mixture of subtle and classical fields. The term non-Hertzian will be used here to refer to this subtle energy in order to distinguish it from the classical electromagnetic (EM) fields described by Hertz and Maxwell and from quantum potential fields described in modern quantum electrodynamics. Einstein used the term ttsubtlett to refer to energy which could not be measured by ordinary detectors. Eccles uses the term to define the probabilistic analysis of quantum mechanical events in the brain. Bohm uses the term to characterize layers in the infolded order. Unlike EM fields and quantum fields, non-Hertzian fields cannot be measured by conventional electronic equipment. It is proposed that biological systems are sensitive to non-Hertzian energy and"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"therefore may be used as \"bio-detectorsw. Although such energy has not been measured in the body and is not being considered by the bio-medical community (they barely recognize a functional role for conventional EM fields), it is likely to be involved in biological processes since quantum mechanical analyses of biological systems has recently indicated their inherent nonlinearity. Classical electromagnetic field theory developed by Maxwell, Faraday and Hertz describes the interaction of EM energy with matter in terms of forces acting on elementary particles (electrons, protons and neutrons). The realization that accurate description of our three dimensional (3D) universe requires the introduction of quantum mechanics as well as classical EM field theory. Experimentally observed anomalies, including the EPR paradox and the Calcutta paradox are best explained by quantum mechanics. Key concepts in quantum mechanics include unbroken wholeness, non-locality, coordinated-organization, information in form, higher dimensions of reality, independence of space and time and a unified quantum field underlying all forces acting on matter. Bohm8s theory of implicate orders infolded within our 3D explicate reality forms the basis for understanding the relationship between non-Hertzian fields and classical EM fields. Bohm8s theory introduces the quantum potential as a ubiquitous pool of information which coordinates higher degrees of organization of a system whose distinct parts can communicate non-locally. The importance of quantum potentials and their associated quantum fields in our macroscopic 3D universe was experimentally demonstrated by generating quantum fields in the absence of classical EM fields and showing their ability to alter the wave function of electrons. These results indicate that quantum potentials are independent of classical EM fields and that they do not obey the laws of classical EM field theory. Bohm8s idea that potentials underlie fields is supported by the mathematical demonstration that electric and magnetic fields are derivatives of the magnetic vector potential and the electrostatic scalar potential. It is proposed here that non-Hertzian fields are fundamental unified fields which underlie quantum potential fields. This fundamental energy, which cannot be measured by conventional EM field detectors, is referred to as non-Hertzian because it does not obey the laws of classical electromagnetic field theory as first outlined by Maxwell and Hertz. It is proposed that quantum potential fields are mathematical derivates of this fundamental subtle energy, analogous to the fact that conventional EM fields are derivates of potential fields. It is possible that non- Hertzian fields regulate the hidden variables which control the seemingly random event of quantum mechanics. The properties of non-Hertzian fields will be discussed from the perspective of modern quantum electrodynamics."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"Bearden has a slightly different interpretation of the relationship between potential fields and non-Hertzian fields, or scalar waves. Bearden has proposed the existence of artificial potentials in contrast to Bohm's unstructured natural potentials. According to Bearden, both the natural and artificial potentials are composed of virtual particles, although only the latter is organized into, a substructure. This organized structure can be intentionally imposed on an artificial potential experimentally using scalar electromagnetics. Scalar electromagnetics is based on the presence of a scalar term in the original auarternrar equations Maxwell used to describe electromagnetic fields. According to the theory, a scalar wave is generated by oscillations in the contraction and relaxation of stationary electrons. Scalar waves are proposed to contain conventional EM waves moving in positive time and contain positive energy as well as a superimposed negative rime/~~egative energy time wave. This positive energy wave interacts with negatively charged electrons whereas negative energy waves interact with the positively charged protons in the nucleus. Scalar waves are believed to propagate/translate only if the overall symmetry of a system is broken. Breaking of symmetry is associated with local curvature of spaceltime and the conversion of virtual particles into observable elementary particles. Negative time, negative energy and negative entropy are all associated with breaking symmetry and the generation of scalar waves. In addition, scalar waves have other unusual properties, including propagation at supraluminal velocities without loss of energy, independence of the l/r2 fall off, convergence, anti- gravity and the ability to carry information. Bearden further proposed that the two types of energy waves can be separated by canceling two EM vectors 180 degrees out of phase. Mathematically, crossing two auarterntm equations results in cancerlation of the vector components with the scalar terms remaining intact. Experimentally this can be done with a caduceus coil or with a Hooper coil. In both cases a zero sum vector space is generated. According to Bearden, artificial potentials would be generated in this way. The proposal that potentials are composed of virtual particles is based on the idea that the vacuum (or spacetime) is not empty but is also composed of a chaotic distribution of virtual particles. The notion of an energy which exists in a vacuum in the absence of motion, e.g. at zero degrees, suggested that the vacuum is not empty. In fact, the term empty wave has been suggested to describe this energy. A basic tenet of general relativity, according to Einstein, is that local curvature of spacetime &addition of time to the 3D universe) is not possible. Spacetime has been mathematically modeled as a vacuum where the virtual particle fluxes are constant and an equilibrium exists between particles and anti-particles. It is proposed that the local"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"curvature of spacetime is possible and would result in changes in the magnitude of the vacuum potential. These oscillations in the virtual energy of the vacuum could therefore account for the zero-point energy (ZPE). It has been proposed that higher dimensions are contained within the vacuum. These hyperdimensions of the vacuum are believed to be the source of the ZPE. Thus, under certain situations, the random, incoherent ' ZPE can be *'brought down\" into our 3D universe and made coherent. The concept of higher dimensions is well established in quantum electrodynamics and has recently been elaborated upon in Everett's \"Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics\" which proposes that hyperspace is composed of an infinite number of dimensions. An elegant description of how the ZPE can be cohered has been presented in the Virtual Plasma Model (King) which explains how the ZPE can manifest (cohere) in our 3D space. According to this model, the ZPE normally passes through our 3D space randomly and therefore does not interact with it. However, in certain situations, the ZPE flux can be slightly twisted&- orthorotatea into our 3D space, thereby generating virtual particles which in turn generate elementary particles. Virtual particles can also generate a virtual plasma, which, according to the theory, can interact non-linearly with the ZPE. In this way a small amount of the infinite ZPE can be tapped or made coherent and used to provide enough energy to form the macroscopic meta-stable objects in our 3D space. Thus, the theory predicts that the ZPE can be tapped and used to generate coherent, structured macroscopic phenomenon in out 30 space. Although the theory contradicts the third law of thermodynamics, it does offer an explanation for experimentally observed vortex rings in plasma physics and the anomalies associated with \"free energyw devices. King's model provides an elegant explanation of the scalar wave in terms of quantum mechanics. According to King, scalar waves propagate in hyperspace and are guided by vortex rings. Under the proper conditions, the ZPE can be orthorotated into our 3D space and manifest as a scalar wave with no net energy propagating in our 3D universe. By confining the propagation of the scalar wave to the higher dimensions, gauge theory invariance is not contradicted. This also explains our inability to directly measure scalar waves. The possibility that non-Hertzian fields preferentially interact with the nucleus would make them unique in comparison with EM vectors, which preferentially effect electrons. The interaction between non-Hertzian fields and electrons has been described as incoherent and diffuse, whereas nuclear interactions are believed to be coherent, resulting in a \"chargingw of the nucleus by exciting it's protons (Bearden, Puharich). By acting as a capacitor, the nucleus may be chargeable and dischargeable, thereby accumulating non-Hertzian fields. This theory further suggests that the addition of positive energy to the nucleus would increase the mass of the atom, whereas negative energy"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"would decrease the mass (Bearden). Such nuclear interactions are predicted to result in the emission of virtual particles (Bearden) possibly originating from quarks contained within each proton (Puharich). Virtual particles were first described by Dirac, who postulated the existence of a virtual particle \"sea\" from which elementary particles and anti-particles emerge. These ideas suggest that protons from nuclei in different molecules can transfer information to each other via long-range, macroscopic, quantum communication channels. This type of non-Hertzian interaction between nuclei in all atoms and molecules would not be confined to the standard limitations of electromagnetic forces, thereby explaining some of the paradoxes in modern quantum physics. The idea of long-range communication channels between nuclei has been extended by the author and presented as the Intramolecular Mat.r.ix -. The theory proposes that communication exist3 between nucleons (protons and neutrons) within a nucleus, as well as between nuclei within the same molecule. The local forces within the nucleus are mediated by the ZPE, as dictated in quantum electrodynamics, whereas medium-range channels are postulated to exist between nuclei with a molecule. It is further proposed that the crossing channels within the nucleus and within the atomic structure of each molecule form a complex quantum information network (or matrix). The information which characterizes the unique physical and chemical properties associated with a given molecule is believed to be stored at the intersection points between communication channels. Finally, the theory predicts that the information matrix can be stimulated (INSTEAD OFZIMULATED?) using the appropriate frequencies of exogenous non-Hertzian fields. These fields would therefore carry the quantum information associated with a given moleculers matrix. As we shall see later in this report, the theory is supported by direct experimental data. GENERATING NON-HERTZIAN FIELDS Although non-Hertzian energy cannot be directly measured, several devices have been built which theoretically generate non-Hertzian waves. Most of these devices generate non-Hertzian waves by interacting (bucking) two equal EM fields 180 degrees opposed, to cancel the EM vectors. In psychotronics, this is achieved with a caduceus coil or a fIooper coil. In non-linear optics it' . is achieved using four-wave mixing. In this technique an EM field (E3) is introduced into a vector canceled space (vectors El and E2 are 180 degrees opposed and equal in magnitude), thereby generating a non-Hertzian wave (E4) with a much greater amplitude than the E3 input vector field. This approach allows for amplification of non-Iiertzian waves. Another technique in non-linear optics is phase conjugation. Here EM fields are reflected off a non-linear mirror, thereby generating a non- Hertzian wave which is referred to as a phase conjugate replica of the original EM vector. The replica travels backward in time"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"and retraces the path taken by the original EM vector. This technic was first used by Raymond Rife in the 1930ts, when he built his high powered microscope. The microscope utilized the convergence property of phase-conjugate waves, thereby minimizing distortion normally associated with diverging EM vectors. ~dn-linear interactions in plasma physics can also be used to generate non-Hertzian waves. The complex non-linear interactions among the different types of plasma waves within a pla'sma structure has been well described in plasma theory. Abruptly pulsing a plasma will theoretically generate non-Hertzian waves. Propagation of non-Hertzian emissions from plasma tubes has been described in terms of a self-focusing mechanism. Such emissions are the basis of the cancer curing machine of Priore and the beam ray generator of Raymond Rife. Finally, the emerging field of psychotronics uses radionics and free-energy devices which may generate non-Hertzian fields. With r the use of hyperspatial engineering, psychotronic devices have een built by modifying audio amplifiers and doping crystal ii 6\" lattices in transistors. Although these electrical circuits do '\" r\" not follow the principals of traditional engineering, they exhibit properties consistent with the emission of non-Hertzian waves. The devices described above should theoretically generate non- Hertzian fields. Support for this conclusion is based on the numerous reportings of anomalous behavior associated with these devices in regard to temperature, inertia, gravity or mass measurements. Such anomalies were first observed by Tesla as ball lightning during his Colorado Springs experiments with his magnifying coil. These anomalies are likely to be explained by the theoretical quantum physics just described. Since some psychotronics devices have been used with biological systems and biological systems have been recently modeled using quantum mechanics, anomalous biological behavior may also be expected . from these devices. Such biological implications have received little attention. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE Evidence exists which suggests that these non-Hertzian fields will affect biological systems and may be involved in the natural healing process. It has therefore been suggested that quantum mechanical events mediated by non-Hertzian fields may link chemical and EM events in biological systems. Furthermore, theories suggest how subatomic quantum events can influence macroscopic processes in biological systems. However, the exact role and mechanism of action of quantum non-Hertzian fields in biology will require further experimentation. DelGuidice has mathematically characterized the quantum mechanical propagation of EM fields in structured water and"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"referred to such propagation as non-Maxwellian. His studies clearly support a role for non-Hertzian phenomenon in biological systems and indicates a key role for water. The physiological role of structured water surrounding biomolecules and at the surface of the plasma membrane has received some attention from the scientific community. Using proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), this \"interfacial\" water has been shown to be more structured and organized than bulk wateqwhere decreased hydrogen bonding between individual water dipoles results in a more random orientation. A functional role for structured water is indicated by experiments where the hydrogen bonds are intentionally broken, causing a shift in the orientation (or the norder parameterm) of the biomolecules (e.g. glycoproteins on the plasma membrane). Structured water in biological systems is characterized by altered electrical properties (e.g. dielectric constant and conductivity) and readily and reversibly converts to random bulk water. Thus structured water and bulk water are in equilibrium. Although water is composed of hydrogen and.oxygen ions, the hydrogen ion has been the focus of attention in terms of understanding the role of non-Hertzian ZPE.. .Putho.ff considered the ground state of the hydrogen atom aa.EPE determined state and used quantum electrodynamics to calculate the amount of ZPE absorbed and emitted by hydrogen. Puharich also uses the hydrogen molecule in describing the subnuclear origin of scalar energy. As previously discussed, Puharich has proposed that scalar waves originate in the monopoles and anti-monopoles, which are located within the protons. Puharich has extended these ideas into the biological arena by proposing that non-Hertzian fields are emitted from the body during the laying-on-of hands healing and originate from the hydrogen bonds which hold DNA strands together. -. Bearden has also extended his hypothesis to include biological . systems. Bearden proposes that each cell in the body is composed of subatomic biopotentials. The biopotentials, which are located in the atomic nuclei, are composed of disordered, unstructured charge patterns of scalar energy which form virtual substructures. Scalar energy absorbed by the cells will charge and organize the biopotentials, unlike EM fields which only change the magnitude of the biopotentials. Cells which are in open exchange with their extracellular environmentl also discharge their biopotentials by releasing structured scalar photons as well as conventional photdns. The scalar photons released from diseased cells, which have a characteristic information pattern associated with the particular disease, can communicate the diseased energy pattern to all cells in the body. Bearden also proposes that all disease could be cured if we could isolate the diseased energy pattern, apply it to a phase conjugate mirror and generate itfs time reversed scalar wave. This scalar wave, which would contain the healing pattern for that particular disease, could then be used to treat the patient. A parallel approach would be to generate the scalar information"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"pattern from an antibody isolated from the diseased patientts blood. A scalar wave with this information would charge the immune system resulting in a permanent scalar immunization. BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE Although there are several theories for the role of non-Hertzian scalar energy in biological systems, there is relatively little direct experimental evidence. Several different approaches give indirect experimental evidence to support this hypothesis. One line of research focusses on the biological role of light (or biophotons). Popp discovered that biophotons are stored and released from within the helical structure of-the DNA molecule and observed that biophotons are coherent in nature. Popp hypothesizes that the biophotons which he could measure originate from a holographic virtual EM field which permeates the whole body and is involved with the healing process. Although Poppts biophotons are coherent and originate from DNA, the proposed biological source of scalar waves, their non-Hertzian nature has yet to be proved. Coherence may be either quantum mechanical or non-quantum mechanical in nature. Experimental data from scientific studies involving laying-on-of hands healing, remote viewing and remote influencing of random number generators may be interpreted as evidence that the body generates non-Hertzian fields. Independence of time and distance has been most convincingly demonstrated by Johnts extensive data with random number generators. Similar phenomenon have been observed with healers. Geller has apparently been able to redirect the growth of a sprouted kidney been back to its original unsprouted state: a possible biological example of time reversal. Manning was able to influence the adhesion of cultured tumor cells and could focus his intention to only one petri dish amidst a stack of four. This iscan example of convergence. These phenomenon exhibit properties consistent with those outlined above for non-Hertzian waves. As an alternative to using biological tissues as a source for quantum biological fields, a different approach would be to generate them artificially (as discussed above) and study their effects on biological systems. Although numerous studies indicate that weak EM fields have a wide variety of biological effects, similar experiments with non-Hertzian fields have not been considered by bioelectromagnetic researchers. In the 1920's and the 1930's several unorthodox EM field generators appeared which may have also generated non-Hertzian fields. For example, the plasma tube generator of Priore had profound biological activity on the inhibition of tumor growth in animals. More recently free energy devices, radionic devices and other psychotronics devices have been built which may also generate non-Hertzian waves. The ability of these devices to modify biological systems has generally not been studied scientifically. Although radionics and psychotronics devices like the Interro and"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"the SE-5 are effective c clinic ally\", their circuitry does not follow conventional engineering principals, and the quantum physics described above cannot readily predict the nature of the subtle energy that they generate. Several years ago, the Teslar shielding device was introduced which trapped EM fields inside a mobious strip and theoretically generated a non-Hertzian field between 7 and 8 Hz. A decrease in overall amplitude and shift toward lower frequencies in EEG recordings from individuals exposed to this device has been reported (Byrd). Following exposure to harmful environmental EM fields, EM-sensitive individuals wearing the shielding device showed normalized readings on E.A.V. electro-acupuncture and Interro diagnostic devices. Despite these encouraging preliminary results, the belief of the individuals treated may also be a contributing factor. In order to eliminate placebo effects and to determine whether the presumed non-Hertzian fields emitted from the device might have direct effects at the cellular level, the author designed a series of in vitro experiments using nerve cells and immune cells grown in tissue culture. Biological effects were measured in the presence and absence of the mobius strip in order to determine the relative contributions of the EM and the non-Hertzian fields to the biological response. In the presence of the mobius strip both EM and non-Iiertzian fields would be present, whereas removal of the mobius strip would generate only an EM field. Since it is unknown to what extent the two fields couple, this approach does not yield direct information about the effects of non-Hertzian fields in the absence of an EM field, presumably of the same frequency. The PC12 neuronal cell line was chosen for initial studies since the author had previously shown that the functional properties of the neurotransmitters (e.g. norepinephrine) present in these cells resemble those in the normal brain. It was further demonstrated that norepinephrine release was increased and norepinephrine uptake was inhibited when the cells were exposed to weak EM fields. Norepinephrine uptake was reassessed, using the same standard biochemical protocol, following a thirty (30) minute exposure of the cells to the two shielding devices. Results from six independent experiments indicated that both devices caused a small inhibition of norepinephrine uptake. In the presence of the mobius strip and additional 20% effect was observed. The results therefore indicated for the first time that non-Hertzian fields can have even more profound biological effects than conventional EM fields. Since the immune system is a key focal point for healing a wide variety of diseases, additional experiments were done to determine whether non-Hertzian fields could stimulate the growth of T-cells or lymphocytes (critical white blood cells involved with cellular immunity). Using standard biochemical techniques, lymphocytes were isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"and grown in a tissue culture for two days in the presence of radioactive thymidine. The rate of thymidine incorporation into replicating DNA is a quantitative measure of the amount of cell division. Both shielding devices increased the growth of the lymphocytes. As in the previous experiments with nerve cells, the addition of the non-Hertzian field increased the biological response, in this case by an additional 76%. These initial studies were the first to demonstrate a direct effect of non-Hertzian fields at the cellular level and indicated that such effects could occur in the absence of placebo effects. An additional direct effect of the shielding device on stimulating the RAD-6 gene was subsequently reported (Puharich). This gene codes for protein involved in DNA repair in response to harmful W radiation. The shielding device may therefore activate repair mechanisms following exposure to harmful EM radiation. The inability to adjust the output frequencies and amplitudes of the shielding device is a severe limitation for further research. Therefore, in collaboration with T. Gagnon, the author conducted a more extensive study using a modified caduceus coil which Gagnon had developed to treat cancer. The delivery system, referred .tojStructured-Electromagnetic Quotient Stimuli (S-EMQS), consists of two concentric windings within a coil carrying current in opposite (anti-parallel) directions. The input current (3 mA) consists of a series of S-EMQS envelopes repeated at 5 psec intervals. Each envelope is composed-o.f 3=7 superimposed, computer generated, square waves varying in frequency from 2 kHz to 6 kHz. Freshly isolated human lymphocytes received four 15 minute treatments during a 12 hour period and their growth rate was determined as described above after an additional 12 hours. Control cells (those not subject to the energy treatments) exhibited low growth rates (358 cpm/lo5 cells). S-EMQS generated non-Hertzian fields caused a 20-fold stimulation of cell growth (6880 cpm/lo5 cells) in the absence of chemical growth factors. EM fields are also known to stimulate lymphocyte growth, although the magnitude of this response is typically less than 1-fold. It was therefore of interest to determine whether the large effect observed here was due to the non-Hertzian fields or to the specific and complex set of frequencies used. The exact same frequency information was used as input to a second coil with the same dimensions as the first except that current flow in the two windings was parallel (i.e. in the same direction). This coil arrangement, which would only generate transverse EM fields, gave a 3-fold lower biological effect. These results support the previous experiments with the Teslar shielding device and indicate that the pronounced biological effect observed here was only partially due to the frequency information, and more largely due to the way in which the information was delivered - via a non-Hertzian field. Utilizing a slightly larger input current (9 mA), we determined"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"whether it was possible to transfer and store this frequency information into the lattice structure of water. Water charged with the non-Hertzian fields was then tested for biological activity. Using a modified S-EMQS signal (which turned out to be less biologically active than the original signal), direct exposure of the cells to the coil stimulated cell growth by 872 (relative to the control group), whereas the charged water caused a 612 stimulation. Although a detailed study to determine how long the water would hold itts charge was not completed, preliminary results indicated that the non-Hertzian frequency information remained in the water for at least three weeks. We were further able to demonstrate that the information pattern in the water could be reconstructed by subsequent exposure to a different non-Hertzian field. A second set.of S-EMQS signals which were designed to inhibit lymphocyte growth were then superimposed onto the original pattern that had enhanced cell growth, thereby canceling the original stimulatory information pattern. These results indicate that unlike conventional EM fields, which possess a limited capacity to structure and transfer their energy to water, non-Hertzian fields can store their frequency information in the lattice structure of water. The results further indicate that this frequency information can then be liberated from the water assumedly unchanged and cause the same biological effect as the original non-Hertzian field. These findings offer direct experimental evidence in support of .DelGuidicets theory of non-Maxwellian propagation in water rithout loss of energy. The data may also explain the anomalous behavior of homeopathic remedies whicn have the ability to store (for very long time periods) the energetic information matrix associated with a chemical or drug. The fact that the stored information in the water can have the opposite biological effect as the original chemical or drug may offer a physical explanation for homeopathy. These kinds of studies may be useful clinically to generate a set of frequencies which can override the information pattern associated with a disease and offer a novel approach for treating a wide variety of diseases. In conclusion, the summary of the biological experiments presented in this article indicate that non-Hertzian fields can produce profound direct effects on biological systems, independent of the belief of the individual, that water is a key mediator in this response, and that the nature of this interacti0n.i~ quantitatively and qualitatively different from that occurring with conventional transverse EM fields. If EM fields are just derivates of non-Hertzian fields and the latter can interact with matter at the level of the nucleus (rather than the electron shell), non-Hertzian fields have a potential to affect biological systems at a very profound level indeed and should constitute a key role in the energy medicine of the future."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Interview with A1 Bialek AB: Alfred Biaiek SS: Sovereign Scribe TC: Tracy Cooper DG: Danielle Graham SS: I have a basic question which might be a good starting off point.

He showed him a photograph of a family portrait that was made in 1890 of the Thorn brothers of Thorn Industries.

But they said that they had the actual record of the experiment in their archives since 1890. AB: It very definitely was a set up. Right now it is very definite. There was speculation a couple of months ago 'cause some of the pieces were just beginning to come into view. The whole thing was a setup. SS: What tipped you off that it was an alien setup? AB: Finally getting some data on Roosevelt's agreements, where he signed an agreement with the aliens in 1934. I started looking in on this and it staned to make some kind of Sense. The Pleiadians wen turned down in 1953 again when they insisted one of the points they required if they were lo work out a deal with the U.S. Government was that they must scrap all their nuclear weapons. Well the U.S. government was just not ready to do that, not in 1953. So lhey were turned down politelyand along came the greys and lhey made an agreement with them. But again, back in 1933- Roosevelt's agreement with the 'K's'and becauseof that in 1934 the Pleiadians went over to Nazi Germany and worked something out with them. But there you hadacross 1heAtlantictwo powerswhich were getting ready to fight each other.

AB: Bemuse I not only had all the physics training then but also the specialized training which came from Von Neu- mann because he understood it. At the time when you graduate from thc standard physics course even at thc best universities today,even a PhD, you don't really know what's going on because that's information that's withheld. An understanding comes later. All that is a basis for laying the groundwork for understanding. The real understanding of what's happening has to come from private tutoring. This is why the Illuminati has survived so long because there is a hard basis of knowledge there, as well as ability. But Von Neumann had figured it out, along with Hilbert, and his interface with Hilbert and perhaps Einstein and Levinson. TC: What would you say to a person who had a physics background who wants to have a dceper understanding, how would they gain it? AB: How? Hmmm. Youwould havetostudycurrcntlysomc of the literature and information put out by Tom Bcardon, for one example.

He does put out some good information but cvcry so oltcn hc puts a corkscrew in thcrc, and that's particularly true in some of his rcfcrcncc to thc weather control generated by the Russians. It's not. We have our own. And some of the other things, some of the other basic physics which refers to the bouncing electron in the atomic shell that's rcal for a period of time and thcn virtual for a period of time. Well that aspect's correct. But he says when it becomes virtual, it gocs into a reverse time univcrse, then it falls into the anti-matter universe. Anti-matter universe is NOT reverse time. There is a reverse time universe and there's an anti-matter universe. So that is disinformation right thcre. And what he describes is par- tially correct, but not fully correcL TC: So where else would you Look for more information? AB: Where else? I'd say look into some of Von Neuman's works. He has a list of 15 books and some of them are not at all relative to this. Hedoes havesome of the information and someoftheworks whichdefinitely tie back to thetheoretical approach which was made. TC: But there's no way we can get ahold of the time equations, is that correct? AB: Most likely. no. It is highly classified. DG: Regarding the boat experiment, was it because they generated too much energy that it look them bcyond their anticipated results or was there an alien manipulation that actually generated the field in such a way that they went beyond their expected results? AB: No. just the rotation of the field itselfwould not create , the problem. It was the fact that they locked up withanother experiment which brought them far beyond the 6th level which theywerecapableofgenerating on the Eldridge. They had to be capable of generating 6 levels in order to get 5, and 5 is what they had to have in order to rotate the time fields. Uh,you loseone in there,so tospeak. You manipulate from the highest level what is below, that's why they had to go to 6 to get manipulation of the 5th. But that of itselfwould not have done what happened. You have to have additional orders and you have to have other factors which cause the lock up. DG: One of the things that's really interesting about this video that we've seen is you and your brother's unique approach to understanding time,since you have experienced time in a very non-linear fashion. When you've created a loop like the loop that was created between 1943 and 1983 with regards to locking up of the two different experiments, how does that loop ever break? AB: It doesn't. It is there and it remains there but after a certain period of time it probably won't have any effect. When you get 20 years past 1983 it's not likely to have any problem at all anymore. You don't lose it, you don't remove it. It just doesn't haveany effect anymore. It's already had its effect by the transit and when you come back. DG: Does it disperse? AB: No, it's just something that stays thereand exists like a smoke trail in the sky. It's there and they slowly dissipate over a long period of time. (Regarding the boat experiment,) Nothingwas told to us about travel, only what we were doing in terms of that experiment. We had no expectation of anything like that happening. It was neither planned and wanted, or expected. It just plain happened. 1 don't regret that aspect. The only thing I have sometimes thought about and question whether I have re- grets about it is whether or not we might have all been better off if instead of letting Duncan go back to 1983, I'd held him there on the ship so he couldn't jump overboard the second time, until the ship returned to normal spacehime. He wouldn't have been back through that experience and dead. Things would have been different. Whether or not they would have been better is a wild speculation, and strictly speculation. But it definitely would have been different. I was not in a position to really anticipate what he was going to do. He gave no warning he was going to do it. The movie says otherwise, but of course the mwie has a lot of specula- tion in it that he planned to go back becauseof his girlfriend. Well there was no girlfriend in the other end, in fact, it was a disaster for him.

And there isa lot ofworkdoneon it now. Today we deal in speculation in physics about anti- matter. And, ofcourse, there is discussion, both in the realm of science fiction and in physics about what you could do to create energy from a matterlanti-matter interface without creating an unbelievably powerful bomb which could be very,very disasterous. But there'sa lot ofspeculation on that now as to the two universes, and if you got matter from one into the other what would happen? Can you control the reaction and how much energy could it create? That is speculative at the present time. In addition to that. it's a little bit more than specu- lative because you have theaspects of the U.F.O. ships that have been turned over to our government out in Nevada. That has been discussed. Bob Lazar has discussed the business of the ele- ment 115 and the fact that they use it to generate anti-matter and the anti-matter generator source and from that they amplify gravity waves and this is what they use for their drive system. Now there's no technology like this on eanh. He says that there's no way we can replicate it. He said furlher- more, there's no way we can come up with atomic element 115 in any quantities because it requires a totally different physical environment to produce it. Though he says our government has perhaps some 500 pounds of the stuK And it is incredibly powerful. He said he was hired because of what they called an 'unscheduled nuclear event', in which a number of scientists were vaporized. They had to go out and hire replacements for them. And he got the word. He was at Los Alamos working as a physicists. He heard about this and went down and talked to EG and G and apparently he was accepted and then he was actually put on the Navy payroll, this is what he says, then he went to Los Alamos and eventually wound up working on the UFO's and UFO problems ad related thins His comment was that they don't haveenoughreally qualified people They don't understand what's going on They don't rally understand what's going on with this, and hesays its also impossible to produce element 115 on Earth.

Again to alter it on a major basis, it would be a minor thing for an individual. If it be a major basis it would affact the whole planet, depending on what effect it had. Now free will still plays, then the (time) line shifts and the whole reality scenario changes, after it changes you still have free will but, I understand the basis of your qua- tion: is it sort of like a higher order reality coming down and hitting you over the head and after the stroke is over you go back to playing your little game of reality as you know it, or as I how it or anybody else knows it It does raise some serious questions, yes. And how much free will do we really have? In other words, who else ... lets say, who else has more free will than us?

H: When I was in France, I was part of a group looking into theories of entropy states and the general thermodynamics of plasmas. The natural rate of entropy increase in a closed system defines the flow of what is perceived as time. We were trying to develop a better insight into the process of synchronization between apparently uncoupled systems, in other words to explain how time manages to flow at the same rate in different parts of the universe. We ended up deriving a set of mathematical expressions that interrelated entropy functions, quantum energy states, and spacetime coordinates of quantum events. In particular, certain variables that could be interpreted as time and energy turned out to be covariant. V: Do you mean there was some kind of equivalence relationship? H: Not quite. But you could almost think of it in that way. It meant that the universe could be represented by an ensemble of \"events\", each characterized by a set of energy states and spacetime numbers; nothing more. In such a representation of the universe, the idea of conservation of mass-energy did not hold; it was replaced by a conservation of the product of that quantity with spacetime. By means of math transforms, it was possible to transform one uni- verse into another in which the quantity varied inversely with the other. If you made all the spatial variables constant, the spacetime functions reduced to pure time; you could transform energy to time and vice versa. We had no idea at that time what that meant. V: What did it eventually mean? H: What it seemed to say was that energy could be ex- tracted from the universe, which is where ordinary conservation breaks down, and injected into another version of that universe in which the time co- ordinates of all the \"events\" were shifted by some amount. The more energy you transformed, the greater the time shift would be. If that was interpreted as taking place within the same universe, it seemed to suggest that.energy could be transferred through time.

Thus we have a continuum. The only model I can think of is a complex serial one in which altering the events in a past universe affects not only the future of that particular universe as it evolves in time, but also the \"presents\" of all the other universes that lie ahead of it. In other words, there is a mechanism of casual connection through the continuum that the simple serial model does not address. V: Could you expand on that concept? H: Everything we have discovered so far seems to add up to two things. First, the universe that we see around us and which forms part of us is simply one of many, equally real universes that appear to be strung sequentially along a single timeline. Second, events that happen in this universe affect not only its \"future\", but the situations in all the other universes that lie ahead of it. That; of course, suggests a continuity throughout the system; the \"future\" universes ahead of us form a progression of states that are evolving from the present state. We need to ask ourselves what the mechanism is that provides that continuity. That same mechanism will enable an event in one universe to alter events in another universe. The continuity follows from the fact that objects, being mass, donst vanish; they endure in time. V: Unless, of course, they are deliberately withdrawn from the coordinates they occupy. H: Yes. Mass arranges itself into different patterns to produce the changes we associate with the passage of time, but in doing so it provides the connection and continuity that enables one universe to evolve from another. For example, if a candle has burned down, in the universe \"behind\" us it is still intact; in the universe ahead it probably does not exist at all in that form. The whole candle is the sum of all of them. I have a drawing here that will assist in an explanation. Try thinking of a two-dimensional anal- ogy. Imagine that the universe is flat and every- thing it contains is flat. Now form a solid continuum by stacking an infinite number of zero- thickness planes like that together, like the pages of an infinitely thick book. Every page is one uni- verse. Mass continues through these pages in a thread-like manner. Anybody inside one of those uni- verses will see mass patterns change sequentially. Look at the diagram I drew. Each universe consists of a space containing objects and inhabitants that"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"are all made up of particles, or at least that is what it looks like if you happen to live inside one of them- We, in our privelaged position as superobservers looking in from the outside, can see that every particle of mass is really an infinitesimally thin slice of a thread that passes through all the universes. As the universe moves along the threads in some kind of supertime, the particles or slices appear to move through space. That gives a visible rate of change that is observed as \"normal time\" within the universe. From our position we can see that all the universes are equally real, only the one that you happen to be part of and moving with gives the illusion of appearing more real to you then the rest of them. V: So you would be able to send signals or transport mass from one universe to the other, H: Exactly. V: If you send a signal from one universe to another which changes an event pattern, I assume that the memory of having a reason to change that event is erased as soon as the event is changed?

These magnetic and HRTEM measurements imply the presence of a minimum of 5 million single-domain crystals/g for most tissues in the brain, and more than 100 million crys;a%/n for pia and dup.

Hence, the assumption implicit in past studies that human tissues are free of ferromagnetic material needs to be reassessed critically and tested experimentally.

These chains cause the individual dipole moments from each crystal to add together vectorially, producing strong interactions with the Earth's magnetic field.

Hence, the assumption implicit in past studies that human tissues are free of ferromagnetic material needs to be reassessed critically and tested experimentally. We report here the first demonstration that human tissues possess similar crystals of biogenic magnetite, with minimum estimates between 5 and 100 million single-domain crystals per gram in the tissues of the human brain.

MATERlAlS AND MEIMODS Tissue Samples. Human brain material was obtained 12 to 24 hours post mortem from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Consortium of Southern California. Samples of brain and meninges were dissected using acid-cleaned ceramic or Teflon-coated instruments. These tissues were placed into 70% ethanol (made with deionized water and filtered through a 200 nm millipore filter) in containers which had previously been cleaned with 2N HCI. Samples from 7 brains were obtained from patients whose ages averaged 65 yrs and ranged from 48 to 88 years. Four of these were from suspected Alzheimer's disease patients. Cerebral cortical areas and cerebellum were included for all 7 brains. In one case, brain and spinal dura. basal ganglia and midbrain, and, in another case, olfactory bulbs. superior sagittal sinus and tentorium of the.dura were obtained in addition to the above tissues.

This instrument detects only the total magnetic moment arising from permanently magnetized particles within a solid sample; all of the other cellular iron and other diamagnetic. paramagnetic, and superparamagnetic materials are \"invisible\". A liquid-nitrogen chilling device enabled the temperature of the vertical sample access chamber to be held below -10'~. ensuring that magnetic particles within tissue samples were prevented from rotating. Samples were fastened to a thin, acid-washed mono- filament string, and a stepping motor moved the sam~le vertically between the magnetization and demagnetization coils, and the measurement region of the SQUID magnetometer. . Several magnetic analyses borrowed from the field of rock and mineral magnetism28"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"were performed routrnely urt iiSSUe samples in order to determine the concentration, mineralogy, and packing geometry of any ferromagnetic materials present. Frozen tissue samples were first demagnetized completely in a peak alternating field of 250 mT to randomize the magnetic direc- tions of any ferromagnetic particles present. They were then subjected to a progressive acquisi- tion of the anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM), each slep of which used a peak alter- nating field (Af) of 100 mT paired with a DC biasing field which increased progressively between 0 and 2 T. This procedure is a sensitive indicator of the packing geometry of single- domain particles3! Information on the coercivity distribution then was obtained by exposing the sample to a 100 mT isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) pulse and subjecting it to progressive ~f demagnetization, and finally by a progressive IRM acquisition experiment reach- ing peak fields up to about 0.7 tesla. The field strength at which the IRM acquisition and Af demagnetization curves cross is the best measure of the average coercivity of magnetic particles in the sample, and e depression of this intersection below the 50% level is a measure of inter- tm particle interactions . Sample prcparatlon for the magnetometer. Pia and blood vessels were removed from all samples of the meninges before analysis in the SQUID magnetometer. Two preparation methods were uscd. Large, intact samples of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum were frozen directly in liquid nitrogen. Brain tissues which fractured upon freezing or dissection were placed into a previously acid-cleaned ice cube mold and frozen into blocks with small quantities of non- magnetic, deionized water. Either the frozen piece of brain or the ice/brain block was attached by a slip knot to the monofilament line and then centered within the column of the SQUID magnetometer. Background instrument noise and the levels of laboratory contaminants were monitored with blank 15g ice c bes f distilled. deionized water; typical ice-cube background P 9 noise levels were in the 2 x 10' Am /Kg range. All aqueous solutions used in sample handling were passed through 200 nm filters. All solutions, including the toluene and tissue solubilizers, were cleaned magnetically by storing for at least two weeks prior to use in containers with large, high-intensity NdFeB magnets strapped to their base to aid in the removal of any pre- existing ferromagnetic contaminants. Extraction and Electron Mlcroscop~. Extraction devices made from Pyrex weighing vials were used to remove the magnetic particles from the brain tissues. The ground-glass caps were modified by glass blowing to make a thin-walled cylindrical 'finger', sealed on the bottom, extending from the cap about 2/3 of the distance into the vial. Tissues were digested in an approximately 1/5 volume ratio of magnetically leaned, commercial solutions of toluene and quaternary-ammonium hydroxide (e-g., Beckman6 Tissue Solubilizer) for a minimum period of one week while exposed to the strong field of a NdFeB magnet inserted within the finger. The vial cap and magnetic finger were then rinsed in clean toluene, the magnetic aggregates were re-dispersed mechanically in 1/4 ml toluene, and small drops placed on carbon-coated copper grids for HRTEM analysis. Samples were examined with high-resolution on a Phillips 430, 300 kV HRTEM with an energy dispersive X-ray analysis system for elemental determinations. Mineralogic assignments were made by indexing the spot patterns produced by selected area electron diffraction on individual mineral grains and on rings from powder patterns, with cali- bration against a gold film standard. An estimate of the grain size distribution was made by measuring the length and width of 70 crystal shadows from a large clump. Control samples consisting of the solutions without brain tissues, as well as the solutions spiked with known quantities of bacterial magnetite, were run to check for contaminants in the solvents as well as to determine their effect, if any, on the well-studied morphology of bacterial magnetites.

There was remarkable consistency in the IRM measurements for both the brain t~ssue and the meninges. There was little difference in IRM from one area of cerebral cortex to anoth- er or in. the cerebral versus the cerebellar cortex. Differences between tissues from the normal brains versus those suspected or confirmed to be Alzheimer's disease cases were negligible. Areas of brain previously reported to h ve high iron content include the dentate nucleus, the basal ganglia and areas of the midbrainf1. Samples of these areas had no greater content of' magnetic particles than did the cerebellar or cerebra! cortex. Figure J,shows magnetic properties for representative tissues, including coercivity deierminations (Fig. Id) and a test for inter-grain interaction effects using the anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM, Fig. IB). Median coercivity values were about 30 mT, but ranged from 12 (pia from cerebellum) to 50 (basal ganglia), well within the coercivity range for single-domain magnetite. The shift in coercivity distributions as measured by IRM acquisition and its demagnetization, and the relatively slow tendency to acquire an ARM, suggest that the particles in silu are in small interacting clumps. Comparison with bacterial control samples suggests between 50 and 100 particles per clump. Extraction and electron microscopy. When viewed under low power through an optical dissecting microscope, black strings of aggregated particles extracted from brain tissues are seen collected at the focus of the magnetic finger device. In shape and morphology, these aggrega- tions are indistinguishable from similar aggregates from the magnetotactic bacterial controls. No magnetic aggregates were observed to collect in the blank, tissue-free control samples. Rough volume estimates of the extracted material, made by measuring the length and width of the aggregates and totaling for each chain, agree to within an order of magnitude with estimates from the IRM measurements, implying that the extraction technique was reasonably efficient. Figure 2 shows two representative crystal morphologies of the extracted magnetic parti- cles. Grain sizes were bimodal, with 62 of the 70 measured crystals in the 10-70 nm range and the remaining 8 with sizes ranging from 90 up to 200 nm. Measurements of the TEM shadows from 62 of the smaller particles in one aggregate yielded an average size of 33.4 +/- 15.2 nm. Note that this mean value must be biased towards larger sizes because the extraction procedure will discriminate against very small particles which move more slowly through the liquid. Size and shape relationships for alJpeasured particles fall within the single-domain and superpara- magnetic fields for magnetite . Crystal volume estimates, done by assuming equant particle shapes, imply that the larger particles compose a maximum of about 85% of the magnetite. Using this distribution data, we estimate that brain tissues contain a minimum of about 5 mil- lion crystals/g, distributed in SO - 100~thousand discrete clusters. Similarly, the meninges con- tain a minimum of I00 million crystals/g, in I to 2 million clusters. Energy dispersive X-ray analyses of the crystals gave consistent peaks of Fe, with vari- able Cu peaks (from the copper TEM grids) and minor Si, Ca and CI (probably contaminants from the glassware). Mixed Fe-Ti oxides, which are usually present at least in trace amounts in geologically-formed magnetic minerals, were not detected in any of the brain crystals examined. Indexed electron microdiffraction patterns from individual crystals and particle aggregates yield the d-spacings characteristic of magnetite (Fe304), with smaller particles showing variable oxidation towards the ferrimagnetic solid-solution end .member, maghemite (7-Fe2O3). This oxidation probably' ccurred during the extraction process, as is observed commonly rn very fine grained magnetites 28 Figure ZA is a TEM image of a clump of small particles from the cerebellum, and Fig. 28 shows a HRTEM image of a well-ordered single-domain maghemite crystal iniaged in the [211] zone. It displays several intersecting sets of crystal lattice fringes which appear as fine stripes which run across the image (and are viewed best at a low angle relative to the page). The most prominent set, which runs across the width of the crystal, corresponds to the 4.858, spacing of the (I I I) plane; another set perpendicular to this, running the length of the crystal, has the 2.95 aspacing of the (022) lanes. Note that the [I 1 I] direction of the crystal, which is the easy direction of magnetizationfi, is paratkl to the particle length. and that the (1 11) fring- es go completely across the width of the particle without disruption.

Figure 2C shows the indexed electron-diffraction spot pattern from this crystal. Figure 2D shows one of the larger particles which is about 200 nm in size. Other parti- cles range up to 600 nm in diameter. Electron microdiffraction indicates that these particles are dominated by a single crystal, with occasional smaller particles adhering to t e'r surface. Their measured size and shapes place them within the single-domain stability field\". These particles have magnetic orientation energies in the geomagnetic field 20 to 150 times higher than the background thermal energy, kT. DISCUSSION Results from these studies indicate that human brain and meninges contain trace amounts of ferromagnetic material. These magnetic particles in the human brain are diffusely and homogeneously distributed over all cerebral lobes, the cerebellum and basal ganglia and midbrain. The consistency of our magnetic property data from piece to piece of brain tissue and from piece to piece of meninges suggests that the observed moments were not produced by occasional contamination from the environmenl, bur were in situ ferromagnetic materials dis- tributed in a tissue-characteristic fashion. The magnetic material was in the tissues prior to the chemical digestion steps which are of the most concern for potential contamination, An exter- nal inorganic source is also unlikely because of the lack of particles containing mixed Fe-Ti oxides, which are common in igneous and metamorphic magnetites. Surface textures and crys- tallographic featur s fo the smaw particles are remarkably similar to biogenic magnetites studied in bacteria 54v31 and fish . The (I 11) crystal alignment has been interpreted as a biological mechanism for maximizing the magnetic moment per particle, 1 direction yields about 3% higher saturation magnetizations than do other directions B.rb.8.3Y prismatic particle shape is also uncommon in geological magnetite crystals of this size, which are usually octahedra. Hence, these magnetite crystals probably form within human tissues by a similar, biologically-controlled process. Unfortunately, the tissue digestion and extraction process destroys the cellular organization of the particles. Only the ARM results yield clues to the in siru grouping in small clumps. The present study provides the first evidence of magnetite biomineralization in human tissues, based on both superconducting magnetometric and TEM techniques. Previous studies did not identify the mineralogy of the magnetic materials, nor elimin e the possibility of contamination as a source of the ferromagnetic material. Kirschvinka' noted the presence of fine-grained ferromagnetic material in tissue from adrenal cortex which had a coercivity distri- bution consistent with magnetite, but t c niques for extracting and characterizing the material had not been developed. Baker et al. lrn attempted to measure the soft tissues of the brain, but found they were not significantly more magnetic than the background noise of their magne- tometer system. They did report, however, detecting magnetic material within the human ethrnoid bone, as well as the presence of histologically stainable iron. However, the levels of magnetite inferred to be present were surprisingly high, and a subsequent coercivity spectral analysis ruled out m etite as the source with metallic sawblade contamination the most. . . . . probable explanation? One other group38 extracted magnetic particles from digested lung tissue, but the autjlors were unable to distinguish the exogenous particles inhaled from at- mospheric dust from biochemical precipitates. Their extraction procedure, however, would only be effective for the large (>> 1 um) particles most likely to be inorganic contaminants. In recent years, several medical groups have claimed that MRI images weighted by the TI and f2 spin ec o C rrelated with the observed distribution of stainable ferric iron in 2*5S*40. These anomalous spin echoes have been interpreted as arising from human brain tissue irregular distributions of paramagnetic iron (deoxyhemoglobin, ferritin, and hemosiderin). ' Iron distribut' ns measured in this fashion increased with age, as is known from extensive isrologi- a1 worky1. However, this interpretation was challenged subsequently by Chen et als4q who fo d generally poor correlation between iron concentration and T2 relaxation, and by Biui et .IFq, who discovered that the iron-correlated spin echo effects did not have the quadratic variation with increasing magnetic field strength predicted by the paramagnetic hypothesis."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"~Ithough not suggested by any of these authors. all of these results are compatible with the presence of trace levels of magnetite. Unlike paramagnetic material magnetite saturates in 22 applied fields around 0.3 tesla. as did the soin echoes of Bizzi et al. . The presence of magnetite in human tissues has potential implication for at least two biomedical issues which have been discussed extensive1 in the literature; these include human exposure to the strong static fields used in MRI studie3 and the much weaker 50 and 0 r elf fields produced by the electric power system and appliances in industrialized countries . First, MRI systems are now being used routinely in clinical applications which subject patients to static background magnetic fields in excess of 1.5 tesla. 30.000 times stronger than typical geomagnetic fields. Under these conditions the maximu? magnet static orientational potential 9 erlergies for the magnetic particle clumps are between 10 and 10 times higher than the ther- mal energy, kT, at body temperature. Hence, the energies are much larger than the chemical energies present in covalent bonds, which typically are on the order of 100 kT. Second. the magnetic torque from external alternating fields will induce mechanical oscillations in the parti- cles, and the potential exists for such motions to do things like opening trans-membrane ion channels. Two separate analytical .approaches suggest that fields of 50 or 60 Hz with peak intensities It tly stronger than that of the earth would be required to make these effects stand above kT 16*' Although peak alternating magnetic fields generated by most electr'c transmis- sion lines are well below this level, some electric appliances produce stronger fieldJ4. Unfor- tunately, without more knowledge of the cellular location. ultrastructure, or biological function of these particles, it is impossible to predict whether magnetomechanical effects of this sort pose a human health hazard.

(Nicholas H.- Steneck, \"The Microwave Debate\", (1984) Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Halliday Litho,p.l85) The Environmental Protection Agencies monitoring program revealed that general population exposure ranges between luW/cmz and 100uW/cm2 (Steneck, p231) The fact that general population exposure to RF radiation is generally at low levels for long periods of time strongly suggests that the focus of scientific experimentation should be chronic, low-level studies. High-level (10m~/cmz) and above thermal experiments have little relevance to the general population.

Michaelson's group presented some evidence that hish-level. short-term effects could be duplicated by lower-1evel.lonq-term effects, suggesting that the critical factor in considering effects (E) might not be incident energy (I) alone, but incident energy times exposure duration (T), or E=IxT (Stenck, p39-42) No evidence was advanced in the Tri-Service Research program which supported the assumption that there was a threshold power level below which hazards or effects would not occur, no matter how long the exposure period. The thermal solution was not above question (Steneck, p.42) As logical as the thermal solution to the RF bioeffects problem seemed, it was not based on the sort of critical reasoning that is supposed to typify the scientific method. It is commonly argued that because thermal effects disappeared below some threshold, all effects must disappear below that threshold. This conclusion would follow if it were known that there could be no effects other than thermal effects. (Steneck, p43) In 1956, The General Electric Company initially set lmW/cm2 and Bell Labs adopted a safety standard of O.lmW/cm2 (Steneck page 51), until they were \"convinced\" to relax their standards by the Tri-Service program, in order to provide continuity and support for the military view. (General Electric Technical Information Series, Schenectady , New York, 1956; W. Mumford, \"Hazards to Personnel Near Power UHF .Transmitting Antennas,\" Project Report 717, Bell Laboratories, New York, 1956) ANSI does not set standards. Its role in standard setting is that of a facilitator or mediator. ANSI officials will, if requested, determine the need for standards and ask organizations or individuals to develop them, The standards ANSI publishes are simply standards developed by one or more sponsoring organizations and subsequently voluntarily adopted by the community of users. (Steneck, p55). The sponsoring organizations for the RF radiation standard were the U.S. Navy and the IEEE. The standard of 10mW/cm2 and subsequent ANSI standards were developed to ensure the continued progress of military and industrial R&D programs. Professor Schwan, the originator of the 10mW/cm2 standard, thought of the bioeffects issue strictly in thermal terms. He knew of no mechanisms that could account for sensitivities to very low energy flux.

Soviet standard setters regarded discomfort as a significant enough health effect to be classed as a hazard and used as a basis for setting standards. (Steneck, p64) ' . In 1969, a Symposium was held in Richmond, Virgina, in which steps for setting a standard were offered by a well-known Czech scientist, Karel Marha. He stated that visits to areas with diverse applications of EM radiation turned up the symptoms of pains in t-he head and eyes, fatigue connected with overall weakness, dizziness, and vertigo. (Karel Marha, \"Maximum Admissible Values of HF and UHF Electromagnetic Radiation at work places in Czech.\", in Biological Effects and Health Implications of Microwave Radiation, (1970), p188-191) U.S. scientists have consistently objected to the use of cumulative models in setting standards, primarily because they have yet to be convinced that there are long-term cumulative effects. Instead, they have relied on some type of short term thermal model for setting standards (Steneck p66) The US standard, at every stage of its development, was significantly influenced by subjective factors. The dominence of the thermal model was the product of bureaucratic decisions that vested control of standard setting in the hands of a few key individuals, notably Knauf, Schwan and their successors.

Open contracts were no longer awarded and efforts were made to keep information about central nervous system research from circulating too widely. Privately, the militat+ and the State Department began work to try and determine the possibility of exploiting the non- thermal effects of RF radiation for espionage and miltary purposes. The primary motivation for the work was a desire to find our the purpose of a beam of microwave radiation that was being directed at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. (Steneck,' p88-89).

The EPA governs the RF pollution problem in the environment (Steneck, p.127) The EPA has not yet set general population exposure standards. (Steneck, p135) In July 1970, Arthur W. (Bill) Guy took over the chairmanship of C95.IV, which was supposed to review the exposure standard. He set up five groups to \"identify and documenty the requirements for additional information needed to modify or improve the standards\". The five groups were chaired by Raytheon, Ark ~lectronics, the U.S. Information hgency, Randomline, Bell Telephone, and the Bureau of Radiological Health. The majority of these hNS1 members were not willing to take steps that would have provided incentives to expand the base of RF bioeffects research. (Steneck, ~150). The current philosophy of ANSI relative to RF radiation is that the military and other users of RF equipment are not compelled to do population studies to determine negative effects, or tell exposed populations that they do not have the evidence to guarantee safety. Industrial RF equipment owners do not have to run biological assay tests before subjecting workers to it. ANSI does not have to be sure of its scientific information before issuing a standard. Milton Zaret wrote a brief letter to ANSI members in April of 1970, proposing these changes, but it was rejected as not being in the interests'of the military-industrial complex. Had Zarets proposed reworking of C95.1 been accepted, it would have changed ANSI's philosophy of standard setting and thereby the accepted protocol for RF bioeffects research, This is the course most RF bioeffects research would follow throughout the remainder of the 1970's and into the 1980's.

Guy stated that he \"did not select the criteria for the study ... it was selected in the statement of work disseminated by the Air Force.\" In other words, Guy deflected Freys criticism by shifting the responsibility for planning from himself to his Air Force sponsors \"Why,\" Frey queried in a follow-up comment, \"did Guy take on a project which involved the expenditure of approximately $1.5 M of public funds with the known crucial tests ruled out by the sponsor?

After three months, the animnals were in a state of heightened immune system stimulation, often resulting in impaired adrenal function and development of tumors. A 1984 EPA summary document corroborated this link between RF radiation exposure and immune system problems, reporting negative changes in blood count, immunity, and .overall health due to RF exposure. \"Some scientists interpret these results to mean that non-ionizing radiation is a source of \"non-specific stress\".

Field Enhancement Effects: A field generated by microwaves and its associated electromagnetic radiation is unperturbed until an object (human, building,etc) comes within the field, The field is then perturbed (called field enhancement) and this can raise the field strength considerably, particularly around the head.

(Microwave News, 1986, November/December, p.6) There is very sharply defined resonance condition whereby energy can be inserted into a living system. Microwaves can act as a carrier able to deposit the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency as the microwave modulation signal within tissue, where the non-linearities would demodulate it. This aspect of magnetic resonance in living tissue increases the risk of disease and damage to the immunological system. (Aarholt, E., Jaberranski ,M., Jaffary-Asl, A.H., Marsh, P.N. and Smith, C.W.

In 1965, the Army and Air Force adopted the lOmW limit, and in 1966 ANSI adopted it as an occupational exposure guideline (though not for the general public). The ANSI decision is remarkable since Schwan consistently maintained that his dosage limit was safe for probably no more than an hour. (Becker, R.O., and Selden, G.

At frequencies helow 300 Hz, electrical gradients at the surface of a body in air will be determined by the capacitance to free space (Barnes et d., 19671, which is a function of the body's mass and shape. This cnpacitance, C, far from ground, is: 11.1 Central Nervous System 1 1.1.1 Introduction Absorption of RFEM energy is often associated with elevations of temperature in the absorbing material. For most mammalian tissues, this add~!ci thermal burden may amount to 70 percent or more of the metabolic heat production (1 to 3 W/kg) before a significant rise in tissue temperature occurs (X.1 'C), due to efficient heat removal by adaptive physiological mechanisms that characterize endothermic spe- cies (see Section 15). Secondary effects of RFEhl fields attributable to elevated temperature have been well categorized and in general differ little from effects of hyperthermia induced by other means (Presman, 1968; Michaelson et al., 1975). However, it is now clear that some tissue interactions with RFEM fields that produce temperature increments orders of magnitude less than 0.1 'C result in major physiological changes that cannot be attributed to elevated tempera- ture per se. The need for quite different models of transductive coupling of these weak fields relates to 'windowsw in frequency and incident energy, which characterize these interactions in brain and some other tissues, and to the very weak oscillating electric gradients in tissue shown to be effective in modifying cell functions by mecha- nisms that appear to *amplifyw the triggering field. These amplification mechanisms may be based on nonequilibrium processes, with long- range, resonant. molecular internctions. They are in the class of \"cooperative\" processes and have been widely recognized as important in immunological and endocrine reactions, as well as in neurobiological excitation. A strong presumptive site for their occurrence is at the surface of the cell membrane. 1 1.1.2 Observed Biological Sensitivities to Weak Enuironmental RFEM Fields Biological effects of environmental oscillatir~g electric fields are related to the electric gradient they induce in the tissue. This gradient where to is the dielectric permittivity of free space and r is the distance to the point of interest. For a spheroidal model, this equation gives a capacitance of 50 pf for r = 0.5 meters. A typical value of specific impedance of brain tissue at ELF is 300 Q cm (Freygang and Landau, 1955). If the induced electric gradient were uniform throughout a body having the electricnl characteristics of brain tissue (a reasonable assumption for order-of-magnitude calculations), the expected tissue gradient for a 10-92 environmental field of 10 V/m would be only lod V/cm. This value agrees well with a total current measurement induced bv such a field in a model of a monkey head (Vaientino, 1972). However, to appreciate fully the relation of these weak tissue com- ponents of ELF fields to possible excitatory effxts in brain tissue, it must be remembered that nerve cells are enclosed in an extracellular fluid with a conductivity -1000 times higher than that of the cell membrane. This fluid, thus, effectively shunts the cells it surrounds, providing a preferred pathway for field-induced currents. Extracellular fluid typically accounts for about 20 percent of the tissue volume and has a specific resistance from 4 to 20 R cm. Membrane resistance per unit area for different types of cells (Coombs el d., 1959) ranges from 1000 to 5000 9/cm2. Thus, only -1/1000 of the induced extracellular current would be expected, to flow through the cell membrane and, hence, to contribute directly to excitation of the nerve cell. For the 10-Hz, 10-V/m field cited above, the total tissue current is of the order of lo-' A/cm2. The expected transmembrane component entering the cell would be a mere lo-\" A/cm2 for production of an impulse. Even though membranes of some nerve cells (in contrast to fibers) have been tbund two or three orders of magnitude more sensitive, there is a gap of about lo5 between the magnitude of tissue components of these environmental fields and the usually accepted thresholds for exciGtion of nerve fibers. Nevertheless, evidence to be cited has shown that these weak-field gradients produce a variety of behavioral, phys- iological and chemical responses when they are within certain fre- quency and amplitude bounds. A second class of windowed interactions with clear effects in brain tissue occurs in RFEM fields that are nmplitVde or pulse modulated at frequencies below 1000 Hz and particularly in the range between 1 National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements NCRP REPORT N~. 86"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"to PO Hz. Unmodulated fields do not produce these effects. Here, the tielcl coupling to tissue is much stronger, and, for body dimensions from 0.05 wavelength to lengths that approach resonance, energy absorption is proportional to the square of the frequency (f ') (Johnson 'et al., 1977). For carrier frequencies between 150 and 450 MHz, behavioral and physiological effects have been observed under induced brain gradients in the range 10 to 100 mV/cm (Bassen et al., 1977). For this band of carrier frequencies, gradients at these levels are induced in the brain of most mammals, including man, by incident fields at 0.1 and 1.0 mW/cmz (electric gradients in air approximately 19 and 60 V/m). These gradients have the same range of amplitudes as the intrinsic, low-frequency oscillations of the electroencephalo- gram (EEG) in brain extracellular fluid, when measured over the dimensions of a single neuron. The search for \"windowed\" biological effects has centered on these two types of interactions; one involving direct interaction with low- frequency fields, and the other induced by RFEhI fields amplitude modulated at low frequencies. Two 'windowsw have been detected. one involving ELF gradients of to loe8 V/cm, the other in ELF- or LF-modulated RF and microwave fields at lo-' to loq2 Vlcm. A 50- V/m, 16-Hz field in air induces a tissue gradient of about lo-' Vlcm, and tissue gradients of lo-' V/cm as induced by a 16-Hz field would require a gradient in air of 500 kV/m. It would thus be very difficult to achieve EEC-level gradients in tissue exposed to simple low-fre- quency fields (Bawin et 01.. 1978b). A wide range of effects haa been reported in tissue components under environmental ELF fields between lo-' and lo-' V/cm. They include navigation and prey detection by sharks and rays, bird navi- gation, altered daily biological rhythms in man and birds, and subjec- tive estimates of time by monkeys (Table 11.1). These sensitivities contrast sharply with the membrane potential of nerve cells. The 'resting\" potential is about lo6 V/cm across the 4-nm dimension of the lipid bilayer or plasma membrane that forms the 'backbone\" of cell membranes. Excitation of nerve-fiber terminations (synapse) on the membrane's surface may depolarize it by about lo3 V/cm. Thus, electric gradients in the fluid around brain cells (lo-' V/cm), with amplitudes approximately equal to those of the EEG, have usually been considered to have no role in excitation of brain neurons, and have been regarded merely as \"the noise of the brain's motor.\" Recent evidence now strongly indicates a modulatory role for these fields, based on behavioral, neurophysiological and neurochemical evidence cited below. However. even these EEG-level tissue gradients are ap- proximately six orders of magnitude greater than those associated with the behavioral effects listed in Table 11.1.

There is strong evidence that sharks and rays navigate and detect prey by environmental electric gradients as weak as V/cm in the spectrum below 10 Hz (Kalmijn, 1974). Parker and van Heusen (1917) noted that nibbling responses in the catfish are elicited by a total current of approximately 1.0 crA between two electrodes about 2.0 cm apart. Rays can be trained to seek a food reward in a circular tank in which the earth's magnetic field is an essential cue (Kalmijn, 1978). Calculated electric gradients in tissue based on the rate of the animal's movement through the natural magnetic field arc 0.5 pVlcm. These responses to movement faded out in magnetic fields weaker than the natural levels and were not observed in fields two orders of magnitude greater, indicating a magnetic-intensity 'window.\" These low-frequency electric and mag- netic perturbations are sensed by tubular electroreceptors that open on the skin of the head and are filled with a jelly-like substance. The walls of this ampullary canal have an extremely high resistance per unit area (6 MR/cm2) and the core of the canal has a low specific resistance (31 R cm). The canal, therefore, exhibits ideal cable prop- erties for DC potentials and for low-frequency electric osciIIations. The low-pass frequency characteristics of the ampullary system give it an effective upper-frequency limit of about 10 Hz. Human and avian circadian rhythms are lengthened in shielded environments that exclude natural and artificial electric fields. These rhythms return toward a 24-h periodicity in the presence of a lb-Hz, 2.5-V/m, square-wave field (Wever, 1968, 1977). Monkeys exposed to"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"7-Hz. 10- or 56-V/m tields shorten subjective estimates of a 5-3 interval by about 10 percent (Gavalas el al., 1970; Gavalas-hledici and Day- Magdaleno, 1976). There was an apparent threshold for 7-Hz fields at strengths between 1 and 10 Vim, but similar fields at 100 V/m were without effect, again indicative of a windowed interaction. Similar trends were noted in independent studies at 45 Hz and were statisti- cally significant in the first series of exposures, but not in the second (de Lorge. 1973, 1974). Measurements of induced currents in models were in general ageemenbwith calculated tissue gradients of the order of lo-' V/cm in both circadian-rhythm and time-estimation experi- ments. Although these data suffer from some difficulties in replication or in a lack of duplicate studies at this time, they show a general consistency in evidence of a tissue threshold between lo-' and lo-'' V/cm for a variety of biological effects of ELF fields in fish, birds and mammals. There is also evidence to support some windowed interac- tions, with a decline in some responses for fields two orders of magnitude larger, a finding consistent with the electrochemical obser- vations cited below. 11.1.2.2 Neurophysiological Effects of Modulated RFEM Fields. VHF or UHF fields at -1.0 mW/cm2 (61 V/m) induce an EEG-level gradient in brain tissue and may be tested for effects on brain function, with and without ELF amplitude modulation at frequencies in the EEG spectrum. A persistent component in EEG spectral analyses at the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of a RFEM field following irradiation has been reported by Servantie et al. (1975). Under a 3.0-GHz field pulsed at 500 to 600 pps (1.0-ps pulse width, average power density 5.0 n~W/cm'), rats exposed for 10 d showed a distinct spectral peak in the EEG at the PRF, which waxed and waned in cycles lasting several minutes. Persistent EEC changes occurred for several days in rabbits after exposure for 2 h daily for 4 to 8 weeks to a 5.0-MHz field amplitude modulated at 14 to 16 Hz (Takashima et aL, 1979). Fields at amplitudes of 90-150 V/m enhanced EEG activity at 10 to 15 Hz, and 500 V/m fields augmented 4- to 5-Hz waves. Amplitude modula- tion at 60 Hz was without effect. No detectable heating of the brain occurred during these exposures. Bursts of EEG waves occurring in various brain nuclei of the cat as conditional responses to a flash of light (and thus constituting a learned response) were more frequent in the presence of a 147-MHz, 0.8-mW/cm2 field that was amplitude modulated at the same ELF frequency as the EEC burst (Bawin et ol., 1973). Moreover, in the presence of the modulated RFEM field, but in the absence of punish- ment for failure to make a correct response (so-called \"extinction trials\"), the decline of performance to pretrainin;: levels occurred slowly over 45 to GO days. Without the RFEM field, extinction occurred in 5 to 7 days. Even though this study was performed with metal electrodes that contacted the brain, spectral analysis of EEG records between wave 'bursts\" disclosed no artifactual rectification of imposed fields at the brain-electrode interface. 1 1.1.2.3 Windowed Responses of Calcium-Ion Binding in Brain Tissue to ELF, L'HF and UHF Fields. As discussed below, calcium ' ions are essential in transductive coupling of a wide range of immu- nological, endocrinological and neurobiological events at cell-mem- brane surfaces. The fluid surrounding cells contains 2.0 mb1 calcium, whereas typical concentrations in the general cytoplasm within cells are Far lower. around lo-' mhl. Effects of RFEM tields on calcium binding in cerebral tissue are believed to occur at cell membrane surfaces [Bawin et a!., 19783). Calcium ions trigger their own release from intact cerabral cortex of cats in a highly nonlinear fashion, strongly indicative of a cooperative process [Kaczmarek and Adey, 1974). Weak oscillating electric gradients no larger than those of the EEG (50-100 mV/cm) increase efflux of calcium and the amino acid transmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), from cat cerebral cortex by almost 20 percent (Kaczmarek and Adey, 1973). These two findings have challenged accepted views that oscillating extracellular electric gradients as weak as the EEG plav no pert in neuronal excitability. This view is further challenged by the following evidence on RFEM-field sensitivitv of hrain tissue. 11.1.2.3.1 Elfects of Sub-ELF and ELF Fields. Freshly isolated chick and cat cerebral tissues exposed to sinusoidal electric fields at 1, 6, 16 and 32 or 75 Hz (electric gradients in air of 5, 10, 56 and 100 V/m) exhibit a general trend toward a reduction in release of prein- cubated 'Ta2* (Bawin and Adey, 1976). Both frequency and sn~plitudc sensitivities were observed. Maximal decreases of 12 to 15 percent occurred at 6 and 16 Hz. Thresholds were -10 and -56 V/m for chick and cat tissues. respectively. Similnr, but nonsignificant trends, oc- curred during other exposures at 5 and 100 V/m. Tissue gradients were not measured, but estimates are of the order of 0.1 rV/cm. All results were statistically compared with matched samples of controls. Thus, the efflux was clearly windowed in both frequency and ampli- tude. 1 1.1.2.3.2 Effects of Weak VHF and UHF Fields Modulated with ELF.

They were then irradiuted in a 147-MHz. 0.8-~nW/cm%eld, sinusoidaily amplitude modulated at a depth of 80 to 90 percent at frequencies from 0.5 to 35 Hz. Unmodu- lated fields and modulation frequencies at 0.5 and 3 Hz did not induce a significant change in \"Ca\" efflux. In contrast, there was a progres- siv? and statistically significant increase in '%a3* efflux at frequencies from 6 to 16 Hz. The response decreased progressively at hiaher frequencies from PO to 35 Hz. Brains treated with lo-' hl sodium cyanide prior to \"Ca? incubation and irradiation responded identi- cally to unpoisoned tissue, indicating that the response was not de- pendent on integrity oi cytochrome respiratory enzyme systems (Bawin et al., 1975). These experiments were confirmed independently by Bliickman et ol. (19791, who also observed the modulation frequencv \"window\" between 9 and 16 Hz. They also obsexthat these effects were only stntisticnlly significant at incident power densities of -1.0 mW/cm2. This power-density window has been confirmed for chick cerebral tissue esposed to a 450-MHz field. sinusoidilly modulated at 16 Hz (Bawin et al., 1978a). In the latter experiments, a ~tatisticaily significant increase in %a2+ efflux occurred only at 0.1 and 1.0 mW/cm2 and not at 0.05 and 5.0 mW/cm2. hleasurements showed tissue gradients of the order of 100 mV/cm at incident lielda of 1.0 mW/cm3. 1 1.1.2.3.3 Evidence on the Site and Uechanisms of Transductiue Coupling of Fields in Brain Tissue. Attempts to evaluate the role of H* and HC03- ions in controlling \"Ca\" movement in cerebral tissue and to identify more accurately the probable site of tissue coupling of the RFEM tield have been reported by Bawin et al. (197flb). Addition of H' ions sharply enhtlnced '\"aZ+ eifl~x in the presence of the UHF field, bl;t was without effect on the non-stimulated efflux, indicating a role for H+-ion binding in these field effects. perhaps in accordance with the model of competitive H*-Ca2' binding on membrane-surface macromolecules originally proposed in Pauling's laboratory (Bass and Moore, 1968). or perhaps in terms of proton tunneling across phase boundaries at the margins of cell-surface, fixed-charge domains (Adey, 1981a). The *5C$+ efflux was sharply decreased following omission of HCO:,- ions. This decrease is unlikely to be due to inhibition of movement of Ca2+ ions into mitochondria and other cell organelles because the bicarbonate concentration was only 2.1 mM in the control medium. Kor can the reduced elflux be explained by increased calcium entry into the cell, because the effect persisted in the prcsence of 0.5 mM La3* and was enhanced at a higher concentration of this ion. On the other hand, inhibition of inward CaZ+ currents in the absence of Hc'0:- ions could result :n decrcuseci transmmhrane calcium ex- change. followed by reduced intrucellular Ca2+ elilux. This model would not explain dvidence from the same study that response to the UHF field occurred in lanthanum-treated tissue, with the response probably mediated in the extracellular compartment. Treatment of cerebral tissue with lanthanum prior to testing the effects of the UHF field on '%a2+ efflux has proved a powerful tool in localizing at least one major class of these field interactions at the cell surface and in the intrncellulor space (Bawin et al.. 1978a). La3+ ions block the movement of Ca2+ ions either inward or outward across the cell membrane. Therefore, changes in &Ca2+ efflux that persist after La1+ treatment may be presumed to occur at sites located in the fluid surrounding cerebral cells. Addition of La3+ to the bicarbonate-free solution described above restored electrical responsiveness, but this response to the 16-Hz-modulated, 450-MHz field decreased (instead of increasing) *ea'* efflux. This response exhibited the same win- dowed specificity to field intensity observed previously in tissues in normal physiological solution (Bawin and Adey, 197G; Bawin et ul., 1975). witb a stimulated decrease occurring only around 0.76 mW/cm2 but vanishing at higher ond lower field intensities. Together, these tindings support the hypothesis that a limited number of extracellular cationic binding sites IS involved in the transduction of weak, estra- cellular electrical events. Low-frequency, weak, extracellular electric gradients may be transduced in a specific class of extracellular negative bindine sites that are normally occupied by calcium ions and are susceptible to competitive hydrogen-ion binding. Studies of cerebral synaptosome fractions exposed to a 450-AlHz field (0.55 mW!cm2, 16-Hz sinusoidal modulation) lend strong support to this concept. Synaptasomes are the endings of nerve fibers that form synaptic junctions on the surfnce of nerve cells. They mediate the transmission of signals from one nerve cell to the next and have a mean diameter of 0.7 micrometers. They can be isolated fr~m other elements in cerebral tissue by ultracentrifugation, and their mem- branes can be resealed, allowing the centrifuged fraction to he used as R model cerebral system. Exposure to the 16-Hz-modulated, 460-AfHz tield increased calcium efflux by 38 percent. but 60-Hz modulation was without effect. Manipulation of calcium levels in the bathing fluid in these experimen~ indicated that the increased calcium eftlux came from sites on membrane surfaces, rather than from pools of intracel- lular calcium (Lin-Liu and Adey, 1982). In non-nervola tissue, studies of hormone binding and cell-mediated immunity now provide categorical evidence for cell-membrane sites as the focus of major interactions with low-levgl fields.

This peptide hormone binds to receptor sites in mem- hrana-surface alycoproteins and stimulates the activation of the en- zyme adenylate cyclase, which is attached to the inner surface of the membrane. In contrast, these fields exerted no influence on the acti- vation of adenyl cyclase by 1.25-dihydroxy vitamin DJ, a substance that acts intracellularlv, pcobably at the cell nucleus (Luben et oi., 1983). Destruction of target cells by rupture of cell membranes (cytolysis) is a cell-mediated immune response of T-lymphocytes made allogeneic against these target cells and requiring actual contact between lym- phocytes and tnrget cells. This interaction ;vas reduced by 20 percent when lymphocytes were exposed to a 450-MHz, 1.5-mW/cm2 field sinusoidally modulated at 60 Hz (Lyle et 01.. 1982). This response showed a windowed relation to the modulation frequency, with maxi- mal effects at 60 Hz and progressiveiy smaller responses st higher frequencies to 100 Hz and at lo-.ver frequencies to 3 Hertz. Unmodu- lated fields had no effect. Recovery of killing capacity occurred after 12hours. 1 1.1.3 Physiological Models of Weak RFEM- Field Interactions in Tissue bio comprehensive models are yet available that adequately explaip all transductive coupling &enomma involving weak lields In tissue. However, it has become clear that many of these biological eifects in weak tields can only be understood in terms of cooperative processes based on nonequilibrium, resonant. long-range interactions involving biological macromolecules (Xdey, 1975, 1977, 1981a; Frohlich, 1968b, 1975b; Kaiser, 1978a,b; Crodsky, 1976; Grundler et al., 1977; Kaczma- rek. 1976; Illinger, 1977). A strongly presumptive site for these interactions, and one consid- ered as a substnntive aspect of virtually all these models is the surface of the cell membrane. The molecular biology of cell membranes is a topic of intense continuing research. It is now accepted that older concepts of the membrane as a simple lipid bilayer must be replaced by the view that the lipid hilayer is tluid and encloses a considerable number of \"intran~embranous particles? (IMPS), which have consid- erable lateral mobility within the lipid hilayer. These concepts are suhsrrmed under the general title of the 'fluid mosaic model\" (Singer and Nicolson. 1972). The IMPS are proteinsceous. with externally protruding terminal strands of amino sugars that bear numerous negative charge sites at tixed locations on the terminal strands. These tixed charge sites thus tbnn a polyanionic sheet on the membrane surface, with a strong affinity for cations, of which H+ and Ca2+ are those with the highest binding affinities in the extracellular fluid (Katchalsky, 1964). This polyanionic sheet appears to form a sensing surface in the first steps in the transductive coupling of a wide variety of weak cell-surface events, including the binding of antibody mole- cules in an immune reaction (Edelman, 1976; Yahara and Edelman, 19721, in the binding of hormonal molecuies (Sutherland and Robison, 19661, and in the weak neurobiological stimulations discussed here. The sum of observations and constraints does not favor a direct transductive coupling of weak extracellular fields across the plasma membrane, with its extremely high electric gradient probably 12 orders of magnitude greater than these extracellular fields (for review, see Adey, 1981b). Some form of amplificiltion of the initial transductive steps would appear essential.

This problem has been addressed by Eino!f and ~arsten'sen (1971) in a study of the behavior of micro-sized resin particles considered as porous particles with uniformly distributed. fired-charge sites. Their model is an extension of an earlier formula- tion by Schwan (196'1, which considered the movement of ions along the surface of solid (rather than porous) colloid particles. At the surface of the particles, the boundary region is characterized by a very large, radially directed static field with a corresponding radial variation in the distribution of mobile ions. Maintaining this distribution has the effect of requiring the ions in the boundary layer to move in a path tangent to the surface of the particle. Porous, charged panicles are characterized by a low-frequency dielectric relaxation, leading to large static dielectric constants. A final result is polarization of the ionic atmosphere at the surface of the particle in the presence of an external electric field. This poiarization produces an additional apparent die- lectric constant of the particles, exceeding the actual dielectric con- stant by several orders of magnitude at low frequencies. The magnitude of the low-frequency dielectric constant is proponional to the size of ;he particle and the square root of the fixed-.charge concentration in the porous material. The relaxation frequency depends directly on counterion mobility and is inversely proportional to the square of the particle size."},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"The effective dielectric constants of micrometer-sized, ion-exchange resin panicles are as high as 10d ~t frequencies below 1 kHz (Einolf and Carstensen, 1971). Similar properties may be expected at the surface of tubular structures with diameters in the micrometer range, including dendrites with polyanionic glycoprotein surface layers. This model provides an avenue for future research into the biological effects cited above in which it ap ears that thermal noise at normal tissue P temperatures is substantial y larger than the tissue components of the imposed electric fields. For typical conductors in the biological tem- perature range, the Boltzmann kT noise is oi the order oi0.02 electron volts. However, this expression gives little concept of the extent to which electric gradients in tissue may be established by thermal, atomic, or molecular perturbations, nor of the way in which compo- nents of this noise may be transferred to distant sites within tissue. In metallic conductors, the transfer function for this noise energy has an essentially infinite bandwidth, a condition that does not pertain in tissue. The transfer function of thermoelectric noise in tissue has yet to be studied. However, a tentative model does offer interesting points of resemblance LO observed neurochemical and behavioral thresholds (Barvin and Adey, 1976). Data from the Einolf and Carstensen study indicate that ionic conductance along a membrane surface in the counterion layer will exhibit an inverse frequency dependence and limited bandwidth due to the very high apparent dielectric constant in this zone. The Boltzmann equation may be written in terms that model the tissue in this region as a low-pass filter: where the transfer function for the root-mean-square noise voltage, e, is n function of the temperature, T, the frequency bandwidth, 8, and the specific resistance of the noise pathway, R. With a specific resist- ance for brain tissue on the order of 300 R cm and an effective frequency bandwidth from 0 to 100 Hz, the equivalent, noise voltage gradient would be on the order of lo-' V/cm. This value is in close agreement with observed sensitivities of marine vertebrates, birds, and mammals to certain low-frequency fields, and these thresholds are consistent with a thermal floor as the limiting factor. Virtually all identified steps in these processes are known to be calcium-ion dependent. In all these events, the observations and models indicate that integrative processes in the coupling of these surface interactions to intracellular mechanisms first occur in the length and area of the membrane, prior to communication of infor- mation to the interior of the cell. This, too, has been a significant new concept in models of tlie molecular biology of excitatory processes. 1 1.1.3.1 Quantum ,%frchanical Models oj Long- Qartge Interactions. There has been growing interest in models for predictive evaluation of these unex~ected bioloeical sensitivites.

Lotka-Volterra models of charge-population transitions, models of limit-cycle phe- nomena, and models of tunneling effects. 1 1.1.3.1.1 Models of Macromolecuhr Phase Transitions at ELF. There are no known mechanisms to explain ELF biological effects on the basis of direct interactions with component dipoles of molecular systems that oscillate at these low frequencies. Therefore. a structural and functional basis must reside in properties of molecular systems. Crodsky (1974, 1976, 1977) has hypothesized that excitable mem- branes are energetically equivalent to sheets of giant dipoles bathed in controiled external electric fields. His model examines the role of long-range cooperative processes in latt~ced mosaic systems of the type first proposed by Ising (1925) to explain mechanisms of ferro- magnetism. Crodsky's model encompasses the concept of a \"greater\" membrane (see below), in which the cell membrane is conceived as extending beyond the phospholipid bilayer by the external protrusion of strongly polyanionic, sialic-acid side chains that are stranded ter- minals of glycoprotein and gangliosidc. intramembranous particles (Schmitt and Samson, 1969; Singer and Nicolson. 1972). In this model, the outer layer of phospholipid polar heads is repre- sented bv a two-dimensional crystal mosaic of multipolar sites (p- sites), sprinkled with islands of glycoproteins. The \"fuzzn of the outer membranes, above the p-sites, displays a mosaic of cationic binding sites (c-sites). The c-sites are less densely packed and less tightly bound mechanicelly than are the p-sites, and their electric charge depends on local, external ionic contributions, which can vary quite rapidly. The prediction of behavior from a knowledge of structure rests on the ability to identify the contributions of p-sites and c-sites to the total energy of the system in the context of mutual interactions between the two sheets of charges. The p-sites are taken to be occupied by ideal dipoles. If the dipoles are densely pecked, neighboring inter- actions will tend to keep them oriented, on the average, perpendicular to the sheet, so that the energy in the p-she$ can be expressed as a Hamiltonian integral of the dipole fields. This field decreases as the cube of distances between the sites.

The charges interact with each other through Coulombic t'orces in the c-sheet and via the dipoles in the p-sheet. Coupling hetween the sheets falls off rapidly as the distance, r, between the sites increases. but the fields set up by the c-sites are of much longer range. falling off as r-' instead of the dipolar r-3. The Hamiltonian expression of the membrane model then becomes mathematically equivalent to that describing the interactions of bands of electrochemical quasiparticle excitations with each other and with a hand of phonons. via phonon exchanges, in a complicated combi- nation of dipole rotations, ion exchanges, and mechanical vibrations. The quasipanicle, phonon-coupling constants are negative, because enerby is dissipated in the interactions. Negative coupling gives rise to the possibility of new bound states (altogether new bands of quasi- panicles of higher frequency), but more importantly, negative coupling always :owc.rs the frequency of the existing bands. The direct couplings between the p- and the c-sheets produce strongly negative contribu- tions to the energy, and are thus capable, under certain conditions, of lowering the uncoupled p- and c-sheet frequency bands. Crodsky applied his theoretical model to a simplified system consisting of a perfect two-dimensional lattice. At progressively increasing energy levels, this system passes successively through antiferro-like, flop, and para-like phases. Below a critical level of thermal energy (Nee1 temperature), at low external field intensities, neighboring interactions and anisotropic fields dominate in the sheet, and the dipoles assume a checkerhoard configuration with each neighbor pointing oppositely, on the average, in or out of the sheet; the system is in the antiferro-like phase. At higher field intensities, but below the triple-point energy, the dipoles flop over so that they are perpendicular to the field on the average, but are still in an antiferro-like configuration within the sheet; the system is in the flop phase. With increasingly intense fields below the Neil energy, or at temperatures greater than the critical point, the external field overrides the sheet interactions. The dipoles then follow any external field and the system is in the para-like phase. When the system is in the antiferro-like phase and as the external electric field increases from zero, two bands of oscillations emerge from the initial \"degeneraten hands of excitations, one increasing and the other de- creasing, until the lowest frequency hand (longest wavelen~h) reaches zero.

This was scheduled to be a main invasion from a different universe, How about other types of aliens that were involved? Most of the other alien groups around, including the ones that had their shipped sucked into hyperspace, were observers of what was going on, not participants. Beyond the obvious fact that they were observing for themselves, there -is insufficient data to determine whether they were observing for anyone else. What about the alien ship, again, that was trapped underground at Montauk? I was part of the group that dismantled it. What is involved is that you have to find out how everything goes together. You have to read their manuals.. .there were seven occupants of that ship; four of them would not talk to us. Eventually, three of them did, and we learned their language and deciphered their manuals about the construction and maintenance of the ship ... They weren ' t Greys? No. They were about 6 foot 5 inches tall. They were essentially human in appearance. They had dark leathery skin. They had no hair. Where they came from we were not sure. We don't even know why they were there, except perhaps to observe the test on August 12, 1943. When the ship appeared in 1983 underground, we were ini tially concerned as to whether this ship represented some sort of \"point man\" for an invasion of some kind. Was there any weaponry aboard that craft? Not that I remember. The ship had a lot of strange devices on it. We took a lot of stuff apart. We took off part of the control panels, and communications equipment. We decided not to touch the main power plant because we thought i t might blow up if we fooled with it. We left the food processing units intact. The ships drive systems were removed. A lot of the ship was stripped down right to the shell. It was left that way. Why would they suspect an invasion?

That is one good possibility. Another one, and I get this from sources I can't reveal at this moment, is that they are seeking certain rare earth elements they apparently can't find elsewhere. Robert Lazar mentioned a book that contained the history of earth and that it said that humans were referred to as \"containers for souls\" and that souls could be traded in something like a barter system. The aliens are doing it all the time. They're trading in souls? Yes. They were shuffling us around like we were cattle to them. Property. What do you think of that concept as applied to humans? Well, it is mentioned that several races consider humans in some ways similar to that. Whether it is the bodies or the souls that are considered property, I don't know. It appears that they are concerned more with the bodies, the genetics, and the capabilities of the human mind. The capabilities of the human mind are virtually unlimited. That fascinates some species . Those aliens that were on that ship. What became of them? Out of the seven, four did not talk and three did talk to us. One of the group that did not talk to us was evidently the captain of the ship. He eventually killed the three that did talk to us. The four remaining aliens were put into \"deep freeze\" by the people who were running the underground at Montauk. I have no idea what they did with the other three bodies. What happened to the craft? It's still there, as far as I know. It was a gold colored saucer about sixty feet in diameter. It had a bulge on both the top and bottom. In one of Linda Moul ton Howe's books they had pictures of types of alien writing. Were you ever able to determine the language they used? OlL9"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"MATRIX III The language they were using was apparently that of the Greys. The symbol that the Greys use a lot is the same symbol that the Trilateral Commission uses. How big is the underground at Montauk? It's very large. It extends for miles, especially the 5th and 6th levels, Almost all of it was constructed in the late 1920's or early 1930's. We talked to one of the men who was one of the contractors who built it. It was built on government orders right after the depression started. It was built in six levels. They covered the top over with earth. It's known locally as \"the hill\". Its a huge base- There may still be some use of it. Most of it is shut down. The power has been on for two years now, single phase 220 volt. The elevator used ran on three-phase 440 volts, and that has not been turned on, probably because they plugged all main open- ings and the elevator shaft with concrete. How many different species of aliens are you aware of? Well, the Greys were not part of Montauk. By agreement they never went there. There were groups that were part of it, like a group who called themselves the Leverons. There were those there from Antares that were only observers. They looked like humans- There were members of the Orion group there occasionally. The K-group had some connection with the place, but I personally never saw any of them there. Lastly, there were the inhabitants of that ship that was captured. The Orion Confederation includes a lot of groups, including the Leverons. The Orion group is supposedly at war with a group called the Elohim. Would you say that is accurate? Yes. This is happening. The Elohim group is a very old race, perhaps the oldest in the universe. At least its the oldest we know of. Is there any particular species that has the greatest control over humans? The Orion g'roup. They're the weasels in the background that manipulate everybody, including the Greys. The Orion group includes the various reptilian species. Was the zero-time generator from alien sources? No. Tesla created the zero-time generator in the 1920's. It provided a very basic time reference which is actually locked to the center of our galaxy. That's why they call it a zero time generator. Locking equipment to that is the only way"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 you can get some of these higher function generators to work. The aliens use crystals quite a bit. Yes. Crystals can store and modulate enormous amounts of energy. There was a crystal in the alien ship that ended up at Montauk that was about 18 inches long. Other factions of the alien group appeared in one of the side tunnels off the main time tunnel and captured several of us, and wouldn't let us go unless one of us went back and got that crystal for them. We did. The problem was is that we were in the time tunnel too long, because the time references the man I was with dis- solved, and he began to age at the rate of about a day per hour. Wi thin three days he was dead. What are some of the ways the government became involved in time travel? The Navy had the ability to use the time travel technology from about 1970 and developed full operational capability in 1973. They did do an experiment where they tried to go back and kill the father of the man destined to be the head of the new One-World government. They did k-ll his father, but it made no difference. They didn't understand why it didn't work. Robert Lazar was voicing the concept that time is quantitized or compartmentalized and that you can't change what has a1 ready happened in terms of the past. Is the Navy tied in with the secret government? Small elements in the Navy are, but the Navy in general is not. So in the 1970's they were against what was going on and tried ways to stop it? Yes. At Montauk we did succeed in changing the past, so I know i t can be done, but it takes enormous amounts of power and more than just a time machine, but I won't get into that. So the person who will be the head of the One World government is walking around and has no father? Theoretically that is true. How could this guy have come into existence? That's a very good question. That's another one of the paradoxes of time. Was this person already in existence before they went back and killed his father? Yes.

Is the One World government interested in longevity? It seems like all these plans are on a long term basis, It would also seem like it would take too long before those in control could really reap the benefits. Went you get to the level of the warped mentality of the world leaders that are controlled by the Orion group, you don't really know what their goals are- They are totally dependent on a specific technology, including time machines which are anchored in the 40 years time rift plus the extensions in the time matrix which goes another 20 years. Time machines are based in the technology that had its origin here within that time period, and from what I understand as of 2003 they will suddenly find that their time machines no longer function. Why? Because they were created on the basis of something which was basically artificial - the rift in time, The function is based on the rift. Then its back to the drawing boards. Have they constructed any concrete plans based on the rift that might disappear when the rift does? I don't know. I can't speak for the whole government. Are any Orion based timetables involved in this? Well, the Orions have their own ways of doing things. Would they be dependent on this rift? No, but the Greys are somewhat dependent on it, having used it to get here in large numbers. The Orion group itself is not here in a large number. They let others do the dirty work for them? Yes. Do you get any particular feeling what things are like within the secret government with respect to the groups of aliens? Well, they were panic stricken to get rid of the Greys.

They cannot stand the vibrations of this planet. The Greys like it because this planet is very much like their own home planet. How would all this relate to the idea that their is a planetoid coming into this system with a bunch of reptilians on it. Would they bring their own electronic life support sys tems ? Yes. They can replace the satell i tes. They may we1 1 be back before long. How do you view that scenario, where the planetoid full of Orion reptilians, or Draco, is coming here? Well, we monitored the signals coming from the planetoid. They were coming in at around 2SMHz with twelve carriers spaced SOKHz apart. The Orion group reptilians have twelve chakras, maybe that has something to do with it. Then this could be the part of the electronic signal that might even be representative of their electronic life sus tenance ma t rix? Yes. It might well be necessary to set up transmitters of our own that would interfere with that kind of electromagnetic emanation. Yes. How about the Orion genetics? It's very similar to that of humans. For a long time they were hoping to crossbreed. It didn't work properly. That was one of the side issues of the Montauk-Phoenix project, to find ways of crossbreeding.

So how does this affect the world government plans, now that the Orion group is temporarily gone? It changes the context of the system that backed up the One World government. They were backed up by and expected support from the Orion group. With the Orions out of the picture, they are on their own. How about the Greys? They're running around in circles. They are probably continuing with the genetic work and the abductions but they are lacking all direction except that which they already had es tab1 ished. There was a recent abduction of woman in Seattle on December 3, 1990 where there were beings that looked human. They told them, however, that they weren't really human and allowed them to see their true form. It was a variant reptilian species they had never seen before. They asked the abductees questions about thei r experiences wi th the Greys. The woman got the impression that the reptilian humanoids thought that the Greys were going to far in their interactions with humans and that they were looking into it. Any comment? No data on that one. Well, since they were looking into Grey excesses in behavior, they probably were an offshoot group and not anything to do with the Draco. They probably were an offshoot group. I have gotten the impression that not all the Orion Confederation is evil. There is a group within the Orion Confederation that function as sort of overseers and they are apparently quite upset about what these Greys are doing, but apparently there is not much they have been able to do about it. The basic heart of the Orion Confederation that we have become familiar with is totally evil and self-centered- They basically want to take over the Earth? Yes.

They are concerned with AIDS and other disease problems which are coming to earth from space. There are currently two huge clouds of amoeba-like creatures over the polar regions of the earth. These have shown up periodically over the last ten years. NASA is working on this. Every time they've been detected, all kinds of strange illnesses break out. They don't how they can stay alive and be in outer space. They're very concerned about that. The AIDS situation is so far advanced that it is considered to be a disaster. How do you bounce that against the fact that AIDS was created at Fort Detrick, Maryland? Are the aliens ultimately behind that as well? I don't know. It's very possible. It originated on the orders of the World Health Organization. I suppose you have to go back and see who was responsible for this diabolical plan within WHO to create a virus that would destroy the human immune system. They found out that once it was released that it mutated 1 ike crazy and there is no way to produce a vaccine for it. The government does have a way to cure it, but they do that on a pretty selective basis. The cure involves electro- magnetics. There are also other means that have been dis- covered, but the government doesn't want the outside world to have it. Its part of the population reduction program. Which is whose idea? Apparently it was a decision reached by the secret government. The final decision was made in the White House in 1972 on the basis of a meeting of world leaders under Nixon. A friend of mine got the notes from that. He's now in prison, and he talked about it publicly in 1974. He said that they had the meeting and agreed that the planet was overpopulated and that it had to be reduced. The decision was to reduce the population from 5 billion, which it was at that time, to 1 billion by the year 2000. They were to use any and all means to do this, They believed that the earth could only handle 1 billion inhabitants. Their problem was how to exterminate 80% of the world population in 30 years. They modified the figure to be 2 billion by 2000, but the AIDS thing is going to take care of a good part of that for them.

There have been recent figures to suggest that 92% of all babies born in Africa today have the virus. Yes. In India, the rate is 51%. It seems extremely irresponsible for a government to create something that can take people and do that to them. Well, it was the \"undesirables\" that were given the virus first, They should have known that this thing was going to get out of hand. They didn't know that was going to happen. It was also figured that it would affect the young set, those in their prime, most. If they travel in time and know that geophysical changes will take care of a large part of the world's population, why would they bother to do it? Especially because you have a bunch of 50 year old men having to wait 30 years. I don't know. Obviously they didn't think. Or it wasn't them who were ultimately responsible. The only ones who would have a long term anything to gain would be aliens, so it further indicates that ultimately there are negative off-planet forces that are responsible. The aliens know about the changes. How did they spread the virus initially? Through World Heal th Organization inoculations that were contaminated with the virus. The first program was in black Africa in 1974 with the smallpox inoculations. They then went to Brazil and other Hispanic countries and did it there. In 1978, they laced the gamma globulin for the Hepititus 8 vaccine because the homosexual population was the greatest consumer. That's why it showed up first in the United States in the homosexual population and why it was claimed to be a homosexual disease. Nothing could be further from the truth, but it was something the Evangelists took up quickly, saying that AIDS was \"Gods curse on the homosexual\", People didn't worry about it who weren't gay. The people who planned this didn't figure on the ability of the virus to mutate. It must taken someone with a really stupid mentality to do this.

Yes. The directives out of Washington seem to point to the fact that the secret government wants no aliens here at all interfering with their plans. They have not solved the problem with the Greys. How do aliens refer to religious concepts? As far as I know, none of them have any religion as such, They acknowledge a divine source in the universe. The Greys refer to the universe as a mind.

Do they use Maglev trains in this tunnels? Yes. There is a. very extensive tunnel network under the United States. The interesting things is that once you get past the coding system at the entrance elevators and get into the underground, nobody asks any questions. They assume you are supposed to be there, unless you make it obvious that you are not by your actions or appearance. Why do humans age? There are two genes missing f rum the human chromosome. One of them controls the aging process, so humans age. Because of this, when cells are duplicated in the body they are compared to the parent cell, not a master pattern that would exist in the genes, so the duplicate is not exactly the same is time. So humans age gradually. There has been some discussion of the biorhythm cycles of the planet. Could you explain that again? The cycles of humans are well known. It was not known until after 1983 after Montauk went down that the earth has cycles. It was discovered by accident. After an analysis, it came out that there were four basic cycles involved. These four cycles reach their maximum peak every 20 years. It's always on the 12th of August. So the next peak will be in 2003? Yes.

There was no wreckage, nothing. There is no way it could have happened like that, but it did. The ideas in Millenium were more along the line of something they would have developed in the Phoenix project. Are there any tunnels under the Pyramids? There is a tunnel under Giza. No one knows when it was constructed or how. How about spacecraft or anything else like that? &n expedition was mounted as a result of data gathered back in the 1920*s and 1930's about a secret chamber under the pyramid. They built equipment in later years and went in down into the pyramid and found this metal door 500 feet below the base of the pyramid. They found other doors. The doors used a sonic code. They found a room with over 30,000 recording disks and alien equipment, They made photos of the disks with IR film. The Egyptian government wouldn't allow them to take any out. The disks were deciphered. They described the rise and fall of civilizations in outer space going back more than 100,000 years. This group built this record room and then built the pyramid over it. There was no UFO, but a lot of equipment was stored on three levels. They photographed over 2,700 record disks.

It's hard to say. My understanding of it is that the secret government is not connected with the Nazis but with world bankers, old money and what's called the \"black nobili ty\". These were the blue-bloods of Europe. They actually did have blue blood, and it was not hemoglobin based but copper based. They were semi-human. There are still to this day, some animal species in South America that have copper based blood systems. There was a problem with hemophilia, and not because of intermarrying. The problem was that they started to marry outside of the copper based blood system. Hemoglobin and copper sys tems don't mix. That 's where the laws against marrying commoners originated. What about these synthetic humans? Human cloning was developed at the University of Utah at Salt Lake City in 1977. They first aired this on TV as part of a series. They had an alleged human clone on TV that they were interviewing. It didn't talk very well. They showed the original human and the clone. The clone was not all that successful. It took 14 months to generate a fully adult human clone in a tank. It was a two part series. The second part of the series never aired, for obvious reasons. CIA sources have confirmed that it started at the University of Utah. The - government has a facility for clones. The first one was built in the Mount Hood area, about sixty miles east of Portland, Oregon. They have other facilities in other locations. Locations must have stable geomagnetic fields and other special characteristics or the cloning process does not work properly. They can replicate them faster now. They have clones of all the major government figures. This is partly for security reasons. It also creates the situation that when someone falls out of favor, they clone the person and kill the original. This kind of thing apparently happens with some frequency.

Hitler could have died as late as 1984. I have heard rumors that he was the top director of the Phoenix project, but those rumors were not considered to have any merit by most people. Eichmann was apparently involved at one point until the Israelis got him. A lot of top level Nazi scientists were involved. There was a man called Huntermann who was the associate director of the project. We wondered if there was anybody above him. There was - a complete collection of pure Nazis at the top. The Germans were also involved in work with the Greys and cloning processes. Are they Nazis still running things? I don't know what interconnections they may have today. I have two friends who say opposite things. One says that the Nazis are in charge and the other says that Jewish scientists are in charge. Other people say its MJ-12. Take your pick. I think that they're all involved. That's very interesting about the duality of the Germans and the Jews. Recently, we received information that these two groups of enti ties are originally from one source out there somewhere, and that they were banned to this planet to work out their differences. They have apparently always sought to destroy each other ... and they are still doing it on many levels. Everyone else just has to stand by and put up with it, I guess. It just adds to the mess. Orientation of both groups appears to be negatively oriented toward service to self instead of others, There have been things recently said by abductees that indicate that they were taken to joint Nazi-Alien bases were they had swastikas on the walls. This was within the last two years. Do you remember the Reinhold-Schmidt story? He was a businessman who lived in New Jersey in the 1950's. I finally got a copy of his book. He insisted that one time when he was driving home from work, something went wrong with his car. He was approached by someone and was taken aboard a saucer. All the occupants were dressed in black clothing and talked in c-:7rman. To him it appeared like they might be Nazis. He wasn't c.Jre but he thought they were. They picked him up by agreement several times thereafter. He began talking about it and he had a visit from government agents who told him to shut up. He insisted. He was picked up and put into treatment in a mental hospital for about four months. When he came out he was a changed man. He died sometime later. Up until he went into the"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"MATRIX III mental hospital, he was insistent on his story. This was approximately 1956- I'm not sure. He was a prominent businessman. It was a sensational story at the time. It's interesting that you should mention copper based blood before. Aren 't the Nordics involved with that? Yes. A1 though Nordics are humanoid and externally almost identical to humans. There are subtle differences in the Nordic alien physiology, and most of them are based on the living conditions that they have grown up in. Their planets are extremely hot and dry, and have a low oxygen content in the atmosphere. They have a larger lung capacity than humans and have a copper based blood in order to carry oxygen more efficiently. The eyes are protected by inner lids and can allow them to see into the ultraviolet range of the spectrum. They have only 28 teeth, as they lack a back pair of molars. Their heads are longer than humans. The brain case is about -2 mm thicker and the bone is harder. The brain is the same as the human brain as far as structure and size is concerned, except for the midbrain area, where there are functions that allow telepathic and telekinetic skills. It explains the psionic powers of the Nordics. They average about 2 meters in height. Females about 1.7 meters. They have no sweat glands. The skin allows moisture to be drawn from the air as well as moisture to penetrate. The heart beats at around 242 beats per minute, and the average blood pressure is 80 systolic and 40 diastolic. They have extremely dilated blood vessels. The heart is located where the human liver would be. The cartilage that would protect a human heart extends down 3.5cm further in the Nordic in order to protect this structure. Blood cells are biconvex in contrast to the concave cells of humans. Kidney type functions only allow about half the liquid consumed to be excreted. The rest is evidently put back into the system. Urine is thick with minerals and appears in color and texture to freshly pumped crude oil. Feces are dry pellets with all moisture removed. The adult Nordic can regulate the amount of adrenalyn in their body. They have no pineal gland. Nordic females are capable of being impregnated at any time, but the males are capable of impregnation about once a year. The period of incubation is three to five months. What about the Si rians? Well, we are finding out that they are seemingly involved in the Dark Side activities with abductees along with the G -eys and elements of the US military and intelligence forces. Me are finding out that Reich programming is currently being used as of December 1990 on abductees. This is a direct outgrowth of work at Montauk. The Sirians are usually described as about 6 1/2 feet tall, blond hair cut very short, and blue eyes that have a cat's eye vertical pupil. They're negatively oriented. I have been working on a case where this 0463"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 21 year old woman has had contact with them, the last time being in December 1990. The beings present were the short li ttle helpers that the Greys use; the ones that wear hooded cloaks. There were Grey clones, tall Greys, Sirians and US mili tary personnel of some description. The woman had her breasts and other body parts hooked up to some machine that maintained her in a pre-orgastic state while they used inculcation bars with red and blue lights to aid in the programming. When she does something they don't like, they take her out of her body and stick her in this black box, where there is terrible loneliness and isolation. She really broke down when she was describing that, saying that she didn 't want them to put her back in the box. They evidently told her that if she talked too much they were going to do that. On the lighter side, she has also had contact with positive groups, There has been some discussion as to whether these negative Sirians are part of the Kamagol I1 group that built the records chamber under Gizeh, but that has not been established. The negative Si rians are considered part of the Orion group that is playing the domina tion/cont to1 game. Is there some significance to the red and blue lights in the inculcation bar? The lights on the bar are of special frequencies. Pulsing of these lights is often combined with sonic patterns to virtually reprogram the mind of the individual. This kind of activity has been going on for tens of thousands of years. Why do you think that the Orion based groups that control todays society use red and blue on police car lights? Its very restimulative and many people have buried memories of programming sessions that have occurred through thei r various lives. The result is fear and negative emotional response. It appears that during the last 40 years there have been a lot of people that have been incarnating that were on one side or the other in Nazi Germany, and we are finding a lot of abductees that have memories of the Greys during that period. Sometimes they find that they are dealing with the same exact beings they dealt with in another lifetime. Of course, we know that abductions also follow mu1 ti-generational patterns. It all ties together. There have been some that have said that Hitler was connected into things in terms of the Aryan race and ET's. What is the story behind that? Well, Hitler spend a lot of time in libraries before his mother died, and he was convinced that the white race was going to be squeezed out of existence in another 75 years. He decided that he das going to be the .defender of the Aryan race. This was back before World War One. He was also relating this to the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion,"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"MATRIX III where in the 24th protocol it says that the white race will be destroyed by genetic inter-marriage. He wanted to stop the trend. He became interes ted in metaphysics . The Dark Side involvement began after a bout with peyote before World War One and his involvement with the Thule Society, which was connected to Aleister Crowley and the Order of the Golden Dawn in England. Hitler also adopted the idea of fighting the communists, because the communists were just about ready to take over Germany. There were not Greys around in large numbers but they were there. The Germans were involved with a1 ien technology. They had one version wi th electromagnetic drive. They had jet aircraft in 1943- They had nuclear weapons but Hitler did not use them. Mind control research was on- going. Getting back to present day, what do you think about the idea that the Saudi government is being bankrupted by the US? Well, the Rockefeller group sold the Saudis 30 year notes back in the 1960's. They are coming due. The Saudis want to get out of the paperwork nightmare so they won't lose all their money. The Rockefeller banks were going to declare bankruptcy, so the Saudis said they would pull all their investments out of the United States and collapse the economy totally. The United States backed down and that is the reason why there is all that forgiveness of debt business going on. It was done with Bushes authority. The Saudis were satisfied. Now the problem with Iraq arises. The Israelis have refused to carry out the deals they have made about leaving the west bank area. Hussein is saying that if the United States can convince Israel to do that for the Palestinians, then he will walk out of Kuwait. That will defuse the entire Middle East situation. January 15th is the apparent deadline date. There are people in government that are crazier than Hussein. As of early December 1990, a contract already exists with Flora Construction company to rebuild Kuwait, so its going to happen anyway . Does Iraq have nuclear devices? I'm not sure. They were stealing trigger devices for quite a while before the government found out about it and started substituting non-functional ones. It's believed that they do. The Iraqis are also said to have devices that had their origin in Nazi Germany, such as the air-fuel bomb, which will \"turn the air to fire\" and suffocate American troops. There is a concern that he will also use chemical weapons. The Uni ted States used chemical weapons in Korea and Vietnam. If Iraq uses them, the Uni ted States will respond with devesta ting force. It would be a good time for the secret government to bring out their disks and impersonate alien species in an attempt to pacify the planet. When the United States wins the conflict, it will produce potential problems for years."},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 It is seen as the only option. They could impose this in a pseudo-religious way in an attempt to unify religious groups that are on \"holy war\" campaigns. Either way, presence of \"an apparently benevolent technology\" would cause a peaceful unification. Presence of \"an apparent malevolent technology\" would acheieve the same thing, but with a negative unification based on fear. There are again another aspects to the middle east scenarios. One aspect is that the middle east represents an annoying delay to the secret government that has been caused by Iraq. This delay could affect certain types of agenda. Another aspect is that since the US basically controls the planet, all this is a sham for the public - to keep humans up tight, in fear, and at each others' throats - it could be reflective of what is ultimately an Orion based agenda. It is a matter of record that flying disks have been seen in all wars and conflicts. How about the Congress? Are they aware of the alien and drug things that are going on? Some of them are, but they are turning their heads because they want to collect their retirement. They're just hoping the government will be solvent when they get to that point. There is no ques.tion that as we enter 1991, many agendas will accelerate and many hands will be forced. Are the men in black residents of Earth? The group is an off-world one. They monitor conditions on the planet. They are not physical beings, but they can become solid. Do the black helicopters have anything to do with the NIB? No. They are managed by the Army. It is a super secret group that have bases all over the United States. They have one near Sedona- They have one in Connecticutt and in Newark, New Jersey. The helicopters have no markings and are used for operations involving drug smuggling, mutilations and securi ty for alien related operations and projects. Obviously, it's all illegal as hell, and they have been getting away with it for 40 years. What about the sub1 iminal programming that happens wi th television? The FCC \"ruled\" years ago that it was illegal, but it never stopped. You find it more common on cable tv. There are using subliminal conditioning on all cable networks. They use it to emphasize different elements of what you are seeing around you. People end up being brainwashed and stay ignorant.

This seeming paradox can be better explained this way: the people who went back and tried to kill the father were successful but the son still lived. This is all related to the Grandfather Paradox. The truth of the matter is that they prevented the birth of the leader of the One World government not in the time stream where the existing person was born but in a parallel one where he never existed in the first place. It existed before and after the effort to kill the father; the parallel time stream also exists where the Germans overtly won the second world war. There are differing but parallel interrelated worlds and universes, each having an endless number of streams relating to individual entities. These streams are ultimately expressed as different patterns and outcomes for the same entity depending on the level of expression for the entity at any one time. All divergent entities are part of the one reality which is the all embracing uni ty. The varied potential tracks a1 1 exist as one unified central force. The parallel tracks that exist in our universe, depending upon which one of them is taken, will determine the ultimate outcome for the individual entity, and this can change. What is the actual nature and purpose of the Orion group? Basically, the purpose of the Orion group is enslavement and conquest. Their objective is to locate certain individuals who vibrate in resonance with their own vibrational complex and manipulate them. There is a concept called spiritual entropy which apparent1 t causes them to experience constant disintegration of their social memory complexes. They do follow the Law of One but observe free will according to service to self. Those on the enslaved planet then disseminate"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 the attitudes and philosophy which is service to self. These individuals become the \"el i te \". Through the eli te, the attempt begins to create a condition whereby the remainder of the planetary entities are enslaved by their free will. That seems like what is happening on the planet right now, especially in the United States. Yes. Why don't they just come down in force instead of using the back door, as it were? Well, they could. A mass landing would create a loss of polarization due to the infringement on the free will of the planet. If the planet were then conquered and became part of the Empire, the free will would then be reestablished. The way they are doing it is characteristic of the Orion group - to have others do their dirty work for them, including humans. That way, the abridgement of free will is not so obvious. It didn't help the situation when agreements were made with different alien species. It didn't matter that the agreements were made with groupings of humans that did not represent the wishes of the mass consciousness. The technical fact of the agreement allowed a lot of action that was negatively polarized. The Orion group specifically targets civilizations before they become a social memory complex. What does it mean to have a society with a social memory? Well, a social complex consisting of individual entities becomes a social memory complex when it adopts one orientation or seeking in a specific direction. When this happens, the group memory that was not available to individuals becomes known. The advantage of a social memory complex is the relative lack of distortion. What does polarization mean for an individual entity? Generally, entities can have little or no polarization, positive polarization or negative polarization. A positively polarized entity will select a path embodying service to others. An enti ty choosing negative polarization would focus on service to self. A negative polarization involves the elements of control and repression. For example, a negatively polarized entity would scsk separation from and control over others by sexual means and have the idea of power as an end. The negatively oriented entity will program for maximum separation from and contrl over all entities which it perceives as being other than itself. Are not all humans, for example, expressions of each other? 0468"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Well, yes. Entities will eventually realize that their actions on other selves are actually being done to themselves, since the consciousness present in each entity is a variation on the same thing. The individuation is present to allow maximum differentiation of potentiality and creation. Many people have been discussing the idea that we are going into fourth density. What does that mean? Basically another general vibratory rate. It also relates to the realization that one is not separate from the creator. It is that kind of spectrum which has been called by the Christians as the \"second coming\". The second coming is a state of being, not an individual arriving and establishing a power hierarchy. When will this be completed? . Well, entities on this planet should make the attempt to polarize in terms of what excites them no later than 1993, or it will be harder to do so. Polarization can be positive or negative. Generally, the fourth density is much more full of life. Entities must still care for their physical vehicles. It is also a density where compassion, understanding and love are more predominant. Full conversion to fourth density will occur between 2003 and 2013. Its interesting that according to the mathematics behind the I Ching, everything goes jackpot around 2012. Yes. Nothing will be the same on Earth. It is changing right now. What we are seeing is basically the death of the third density way of life. Does densi ty level refer to polarization? An entity can be negatively polarized and in fourth density, but it is an intense struggle because of the development of telepathic functions. If there is a place in which fourth density negative entities have established a power structure, then there is more use of the concept of mind control in order to keep the negative structure from conversion to posi tive orientation. What about the upcoming geological changes? How does that relate to all, of this? The fourth density is a vibrational spectrum. The time/space continuum has put Earth abd that star system into that type of vibration. This causes electromagnetic"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"MATRIX III realignments within the body of the planet. The energies and collective thoughtforms of the population also disturb the energy patterns of the planet. Geological changes accompany transition between densities. At this point we are in the last 20 years at the end of a cycle which has lasted 75,000 years. Anything more about fourth density? The majority of the Orion group are of fourth density. Some are positively oriented toward service to others, but most that are concerned with the current situation are negatively polarized and playing the domination game. Enti ties on Earth following any religion or no religion at all will move into fourth density if they are that vibration. Entities not at fourth density vibration will remain at third density vibration and will move to other locations to continue third densi ty life until their vi-brational level increases and polarizes in time with a cycle of density movement. The polarization can be positive or negative. How does the idea of a higher self relate to densities? In terms of an entity perceiving through as linear time structure, the higher self exists in sixth density and functions in the entites \"future\". One interesting aspect of it is that the entity who is perceiving the higher self manifestation is actually a thoughtform materialized by the \"higher self\" itself. Entities in these terms are actually a complex composed of what they perceive to be mind\", \"body\", and \"spi ri t \" . These complexes can occur within single entities or groups, depending on the specific space/time condi tions. The higher self is that self which exists wi th full understanding of the accumulation of experiences of that entity. At one point, the entity perceives a lower self and a higher self. They are not actually there \"simultaneously\"; functions of the higher self interact from a position in development which equates to the linear \"future\" of the entity, as perceived by an entity in this state. Obviously, cul tural condi tioning encourages development of impotent states of mind where the \"lower self\" is in control and the \"higher self\" is reached very little or totally ignored. There is no synthesis that will permit the energy of the intelligent matrix to flow correctly. How are the cultural states of mind organized? How do they fill the needs of the Orion group and the Brotherhood? Well, start with the prime factor of body identification. The society promotes the concept of \"you are your body\", which results in fear, especially fear of \"death\", which is tied in with the idea of physical pain. Combine this with"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"MATRIX III religious doctrine and various cultural ideologies, and you have a very fertile ground for manipulation. There is also promotion of identification with the personality and ego. The ego is culturally conditioned to a reactionary state which is encouraged by media and literature to focus on the elements of securi ty, sensation and power. Under these circumstances, individuals are basically disempowered and blind. In terms of cultural activity, individuals are put in a position where they spend most of their time dealing with \"self preservation\", \"self-gratification\", and \"self-defini tion\". These functions are basically 4ef t hemisphere related. The ego structure of ten becomes fragmented into \"partial selves\", making the problem even worse. What is missing is the love of truth, life, and the creator that we are all a part of. The idea is to transform \"self-preservation\" into right action, \"sel f-gratification\" into right feeling, and \"self-defini tion\" into right thought. This is not probable in the Orion based culture in which we reside if the missing elements are not introduced. What will help to introduce it is the quickening of the vibrational resonance as we move into the fourth density, and what we are seeing around us is the desperation of the negative forces as they grapple for position and control. The a1 ien agendas are beyond secret government manipulation, and at this time they are very worried. That is why the mind control technology has been developed and implemented - to make su're that they can try and preserve control over the population. Thanks to the publication \"The Sovereign Scribe\", we are following this section with some interviews with A1 Bielek and Preston Nichols; the material relates very well to the data that you have just read.

The light lines (or tbe light cone in more than two dimemiom) divide space-time into two regions, the .timelike (in the upper and lower quadrants) and Lhe spacelike in the right and left quadrants. For two events in the timelike region (when we live) it is possible to find an observer moving in such a way that the two events seem aepurled in time only. If observer A sees a particle moving from x to y while the time goes from t, to 4, observer 0, who happens to be going dong with the particle, will see the time change only. If the patticle was in hia hand at the atut of the flight it will .n in bn hand at the end. In the spacelike region, in a similar way one can find an observer for whom two wents are simultaneous but appear to represent an instantme- om translation in space.

After thy were on the surface which was about 1969, thy found that there were entrances to the underground sealed and thy knew them was something down there. The rumon were that there was probably artifacts from an ancient civilization buried underground because there were a lot of mains above ground, ruined cities that haw ban there by NASA's estimates maybt300.000 years.250.000ycars. But they found the entrances all blocked. all sealed off to any underground am. So the word went tack through communications (in the late 70'r) to whomem back to the Montauk and Phoenix proiea. \"Can mu do anything about this for us? We can't get into the indkround of Mars.\" Thy said. \"Ya. I thinkwe can. Give us somecoordinata on thesurface of the planet. We'll havc to run ast~ical computation.''

Duncan had told me, he said that I rwld have the proof of the Philadelphir Experiment in my hands during Ma& of 1990. Well it sams like during that weekend. that particular Sunday. prdingthearrlkout. Iwas in Phoenix. I wasout forlunch that Sunday and a phom measp was writing for me that Preston had ailed and hewas in a panic When I finally got him on the phone it wasalrady too late But he told me that a person had visited him. You see hi fatherhad kenasmior scientist in the Nayworking on the Philadelphia project. And that before the scientist dicd he told his son what had happened; that he had main fila and that hewas turning them overto hisson but headvixd hisson not tom tell anyoncabout it.

Gavrmment agents. \"We want to search your house.\" \"Well what for?\" \"Ga out dourway.\" And thystart tearing his houseapart. Hemwhat thy were looking lor. He didn't hm it there. but he said, \"I don't kmrw what you're looking for.\" And they didn't find it. It tookrevcrrl d8ys. And heshook them. And he went and got his slash of fib which contained two rob of film of Rainbow 3 and Rainbow 4 which were the two Emridge tesu plus a stack of papn, still highly classified, apparently, from what Preston said, because thy wound up in PrWon's hands. So hestarted alling his friends torawhoowld takeare ofthu and take it oll d hi hands kcruse the pcmmml agents wac right behind him about W hours right behind him tniling him. None of hi friends wld touch it. that that he got through lo. And he finally got c the end of a long lit of people and Preston Nichokwas at the bolloln of the list. He called Preston and he was home. He said. \"I'm coming over to give you something.\" \"Well what's this all about?\" \"111 k thac a1 such ad such a time.\" tie goes aver ad hands him the file ad the film and telb him the story about his father and the govcmment agents and so fmh. Preston says. \"Well what am I going to do with it?\" He ycr, \"I don't know. It's your problem now. The gcwmment agenlsare about two houn khind me.\" He taka Prentm out and shoun him his carwith bullet holain thedoorand he say. \"I'm getting out of here.\" And he left. Preston in a panic tried togel a hold of anybody he knew that day. including myself. I was not reachable. Duncan. previous in that morning, got wind of something. due to his psychicteruitivity,somethingvery heavy coming dawn. He took off from Preston's. went home, went into hu bedroom, locked the door and crawled under the bedsheets until about 5:W thal afternoon. This is a fact. He panicked. Hewould not cven answer the phone. He shut oli his answering machine. So this comes down. Preston can't get a hold of me. Finallv when he did get through (I called him) he said, \"Well I called up NSAand th them I had some wry hot material hm that I don't want.\" Thev asked \"Whnt is it?\" And he tdd them.

Actually, in the 1950's and 1960's the United States Government tried to do something about the weather. from cloud seeding to use of electromagnetics. This report will cover one of the largest weather control projects, the Radiosonde. which can trace its roots back to the 1940's from Wi;';elm Riech. The Radiosonde was reportedly a balloon carried instrument package for measuring weather data, with a transmitter that sent the data back to the ground. Investigations show that this is not so, and it was an attempt to control the weather. This report will discuss the background, the theory of operation, and the security measures taken about the Radiosonde. - ._ _ BACKGROUND OF THE. RADIOSONDE- -. . - - - - It is well known that for yeas Wilhelm Rih was experimenting with his orgone concept for modifying - the weather, using OOR busting (dead orgone-the bad %tuff\") to Wuce the Violence of ~~OICM, among other things. He found that the more WR. in the storm system, the mom violent the-storm. He experimented with many forms of DOR busting, and came up with a v~y interesting. simple eletctrcb - magnetic method which was adopted for use bj the Gmmment to reduce the violence d.storms. - By interviewing a retired person from the Brookhaven Qational Lab in Upton, Longwand. New Vork -?,- (my back yard). I learned of the Riech connecfian to the early Phoonhc Project, which was the carry dn d the Rainbow Project (fhe famous Philadelphia Experiment), which was done at Brookhaven from . -- : approximately 1948 to 1968. One of the interesting outgrowths of this projed war the Radiosonde, which A -. had a DOR buster sensor-modulator and a transmittek - Sometime in 1945 to 1946, according to my sources recolkction.

Over the yean Brookhaven developed under secret contracts different versions of the Radiosondes. - THEORY OF OPERATION .. How does a Radiosonde work? The concept is relatively simple, there are two sensors; ow& s8nses DOR out of phase, the other one sews orgone in phase, these are alternately switched to a special modulator that impressed the DOR busting signal on the carrier oscillator. Having the triode oscillator tube immersed in the RF signal of the resonant network and the physical design of the tube optimizes the etheric output of the carrier oscillator. The modulation works like this: when the phase reversed DOR sensor is connected, the instrument sends out a signal that reduces the DOR content of the environment around the package. Conversely when the in phase orgone sensor is connected through the transmitter, it built up the orgone. This would do an effective job of DOR busting. and build up the orgone (good energy) component of the environment. DETAILED TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION The sensors are variable resistance types, there are two sensors, temperature and humidity. The temperature sensor is a thermistor, where the electrical resistance varies inversely with the temperature. The humidity sensor is a electrolytic resistor where the electrical resistance wries directly with the relative humidity. In most of the Radiosondes the pressure sensor is of the ptcsssure responsive selector switch type (Baro switch). In essence the transmitter sees a varying res*ktance which is selected alternately by the Baro switch or sequential switcher with a short circuit selected occasionally which is called the reference mode. This is what the sensors do on the surface. It is also the line the Government releases to the public. Although cursory investigation will show that this description is true. there is also other activity which is secret. The temperature sensor is a carbon bar with precious metals added, and acts as an antenna to the DOR function. It also inverts the transform known as DOR energetics. This item is packed in a small vial, and has to be installed on fasten stock clips on the arms of the Radiosonde. It is painted white to reflect the sun's radiant heat as to get a true temperature reading. it sits above the package in the open. The placement is understandable from conventional science. but cannot be understood"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"from the viewpoint of relatavistic sciences. The humidity sensor is an electrolytic resistor, which we do not understand the operation of, because the usual electrolytic resistor varies inversely with the relative humidity. The sensor consists of a grid of conductive lines with a chemical overlay which we do not know what it is. This sensor acts as an antenna for orgone in phase, it is similar to the eleclrdytic detectors that have been introduced for the detection of escleric energies. The humidity sensor is also hermetically sealed in a small vial, and has to be put in its holaer on top of the Radiosonde, totally covered, protecting it from direct rain. But allowing air to circulate around it, which does follow the released information. In later Radiosondes the Baro switch is replaced with a clock work driven scanning switch, with the addition of a receiver that the Government claims is used as a transponder to track direction and height. This intimates that the Baro switch gives height information, which can be read from the pressure, but depends on a uniform pressure gradient which our atmosphere does not exhibit. This follows the released line but is grossly inaccurate. I do not believe that this is the real purpose for the Baro switch, this intimates another purpose. It appears that the Baro switch is the correlated function which wbuld be necessary to sync the DOR busting to the earth environment. It appears that the receiver synchronizes the DOR busting to the environment. I will say that at this point that we do not understand the sensor scheme. The other part of the Radiosonde is the transmitter. which is pulse time modulated. The repetition rate of the pulse varies with the resistance presented to the transmitter. There are two types of pulse modulation used; one is where the modulation pulses off the CW camer oscillator, the other is where a high voltage pulse supplies B+ to the carrier 3scillator. There are two frequencies used; 400 MHz, and 1680 MHz. The 400 MHz oscillator is comprised of tuned lines with the triode tube in the field of the lines. The 1680 MHz oscillator is of the integral cavity type. with the triode tube inside the fields of the cavity. We will consider the workings of the down pulsed CW oscillator transmitter. The transmitter has two sections, the modulation oscillator and the carrier oscillator. The modulation oscillator is what generates the pulse, which is a triode oscillator with a blocking network in the grid circuit. (See figure 1). The operation is very simple. When the oscillator runs, the grid bias builds up across cap (C) and when the vottage reaches the tuSe crr!9!f the oscillation stops. At his point C discharges until the tube starts up again. As the grid voltage across C cycles up and down. the oscillator starts and stops; hence modulating the voltage drop across Rp, which is bypassed. The value of C and Rg and Rm and Rref determines the repetition rate of the pulse across Rp. The signal with the pulse and its potentials are capacitively coupled to the carrier oscillator. This is the usual explanation. but let us wnsider the relativistic activity. When the tube is cut off the higher order signal builds up inside the tube like the charge on a capacitor; the longer the tube is cut off, the more relativistic signal builds up in the tube. When the tube turns on and oscillates. it slews between saturation and cutoff, and two things happen: 1) the stored relativistic charge is forced out and 2) the slewing of the oscillation between saturation and cutoff has the effect of amplifying the higher order components by 'Ow point activity. The result is that the signal is amplified and outputed in pulses. From here the modulation signal is capacitively coupled to the grid of the carrier oscillator. where the p~lse stops the oscillation. Now we consider the carrier oscillator. the circuit is a standard one; how it was optimized we suspect has something to do with the placer~ient of the tube in the field of the resonant network, and design of the tube. Let us consider the higher order operation, which is similar to the modulation oscillator. When the tube slews from saturation to cutoff, the Y)\" point of the vacuum is ripped and this results in relativistic gain as well as forcing all signals stored in the tube to the output a~d the antenna which resembles a phallic symbol. (See figure 2). The bypassed output of the modulation oscillator, which is pulsed potential (scalar) at approximately 7 MHz is coupled to the grid of the canier oscillator and slews the 0 point from saturation and cutoff. The '0\" point activity sends out bursts of relativistic signal which replicates closely the input signal from the sensors. The other type of transmitter uses a deky line pulse modulator with a thyratron, charging reactor, Mocking diode, pulse forming network. and a pulse transformer that generates 1400 V pulses which drives the carrier oscillator. The thyratron is fired off by the output of the same modulation oscillator as in all of the rest. The modulation oscillator loads the relativistic signal into the deley line through the thyratron wh~ch is cut off but still has '0\" point gain. When the thyratron fires. everything in the pulse forming network is loaded into the carrier oscillator tube as a 1400 V pulse which rips apart the vacuum and results in a high 'relativistic gain\" through the usual '0\" point activity. The whole package is operated by a battery pack which lasts approximately three hours. 0183"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"OscZ LLH TOR"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"GENESIS OF THE RADIOSONDE The original unit was directly developed from the prototype supplied by Riech, and was known as an AMTZ Radiosonde. It used a miniature tube for the modulation oscillator and an acorn tube for the 400 MHz oscillator. The AMT2 went through many upgrades to an 'F version which had a subminiature tube for the carrier oscillator. These units were in white cardboard boxes. They had a relativistic output equivalent to a 50 watt transmitter although the actual power output was less than 05 watt, and they had a low distortion response. These units ran at a carrier frequency of 400 MHz, with the typical modulation oscillator. The next upgrade was an AMT4 and 'K versions also AMT4B. as well as BendixlFriez 3000 series which used the same modulation oscillator but ran at 1680 MHz using an integral cavity tube of special design and a very usual antenna. This transmitter put out approximately 05 watt but was equivalent to a 250 watt transmitter. The relativistic component was much cleaner than any of the AMT2s with the cleanest being the 3000 series which were built into the late 60s. In the 70s a later version of the AMT4B was developed which was very Virtf and did not work. This is what we believed killed the program. In the late 50s to early 60s the Am series was developed which used a true pulse modulator and developed equivalent relativistic'output of over 2500 watts.'With'a peak pulse power of 150 watts, this unit was designed to be dropped from a plane and was meant to break up hurricanes. The pulse net- work did not store enough levels of the solution's lattice, and is only usable for atmospheric modification of the simplest order. The AMT6 is not capable of biofield use. and the rest are capable except for the late AMT4B's where they lost the recipe, and those transmitters do not work. We do not know how to repair them at this time. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS Since these things went up in balloons, and could not come down hard enough to destroy themselves because of safety considerations,'the actual units could not be secret, this would arouse suspicion. They publicized the apparent purpose of taking data, which uninformed examination would back up. The real purpose is not that obvious. If someone tuned into one of these packages, with normal type radio equip ment the signal would not appear that unusual. SO FAR SO GOOD! They showed the public a data receiving station, all set up to receive the inaccurate, unusable data, had small production runs of this equipment. The launching personnel would laboriously calibrate b told th~l someone else h;cld. In the 1950's and 1960's these sondes wen launched from all over: ships. airports, weather centers: Through this period of time there were hundreds in the air every day. The radio range of these things was very limited. to maybe 100 miles. This says that there should have been a 'pile\" of receivers known as Radiosonde receptor, and they should have been very common. Isn't it strange that myself, a surplus . radio collector 'nut: knowing many others have nmr seen a Radii receiver or the other paraphernalia that went with them. I have only heard of them on rare occasions. This says that the Gwernment did not use receivers. That's unusual, to have a data transmitter with no receiver to pick it up. HMMM! The next thing to look at is the specification sheet for the tube, which emphatically says that the life expectancy is only several hours. (See figure 3). From examining the data sheet, it is obvious that they are telling you that the tube will run for a few hours. I have had a tube on the air for ovbr 2000 hours, and at this time have built twenty units with a failure of only one, which is a good industrial failure rate. So the tube will bum out in bnly a few hours'' HMMM! Of course if your local amateur radio operator finds one or buys one surplus he will mad the data, get mislead and not build a circuit that will run bnly a few hours\". He will use another tube. Hence it appears that the Gwemment does not want the public using these tubes and finding something unusual, and their secret is blown. This misinformation will preserve the secret. Thy are not actually telling a lie; because of the design of the battery pack, the tube will bum out after thrw hours or so because of back bombardment of the cathode as it cools slowly, which will destroy the cathode. When these things hit the ground they were dead, which says that the Government does not want the public to pick up live units. Considering that the Government wanted you to send them back, in the 1950's and 1960's, for reuse, why would they design the battery to burn out a 320 tub ($IS today) which would have to be replaced. This means that they were hiding something-HMMM! By packing the sensors in little sealed vials intimates that upon exposure to the air the sensors are also short lived, thls IS more m~sinformat~on. By following these precautions the secret was maintained for over 40 years. whlch says the security was good. If it was not for my collecting interest, and the PSY abilities of my associates we still would not know. 0485"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION This is an informational paper and is meant for you to draw your own conclusions; it is recommended that you \"THINK\" (I know this is hard for a large segment of the public, since TV and the couch potato) and come up with your own conclusion; then read on! OED! In my conclusion, we have two types of data, hard and soft. The security data is hard and can be proven. This says that there is more than meets the eye here. They were doing something that was secret; and gathering weather data was secret? I do not think so. This backs up the soft data which is the PSY read, and the interview which talked of the Riech weather control function. In the second half of the 20th Century, a lot of weather tnodification procedures were attempted. you have only heard of the failures such as cloud seeding. For legal liability it was judged by the Government that officially the weather should be left up to God. Someone loses money because of what they did with the weather. it would be law suits galore. This also is an example of why the Government is doing all it can to suppress the use of PSY. it can blow a lot of cover ups.

Consider, for acampk, the most common meam of estab- lishing the \"inner plane\" or channel connection: meditation. This is the method mast recommended both by channelem und the given channelled source. Meditation is of course, as we should all kncnv by now, a means of stilling the mind so that our ordinary thinking facultiesare temporarily vetoed; this pmvisional silence of the other- wise constant \"interior monologue\" is the means whereby the meditator issuppased to bypass the conditioningtmcn of (culturally programmed) concept, in so doing becoming ideally receptive to holistic dimensions otherwise recessed into the unconscious beyond the focus of ordinary \"notice\". However, as the very objea of chan- neling, out of those ostensibly more holistic zones of being comes charging ... more verbiage! Out of the meditator's mouth issues another voice. In Los Angeles alone, in fact, the phenomenon is so prevalent that it seems every other face has \"someone elvr voice coming out of it (although this is apparently such a commonplace of filmland that \"channelingn seems more a logical atension than an abrupt break).

Richard Hofstader would have a field day deciphering the Moebius code which the general program of \"chaoneling\" carries!) To be fair, the exhortation to 'meditate\" that emanates from channeled sources, like t.v!s exhortation to watch t.v., ostensibly points to a content beyond the significance of its own form-in-iuclf; i.e. just as tekvision bids for your attention presumably because of the infomu~ion it carries, so channeling claims your at tendon by way of the meditative mechanism apparently -use of its unique power to bring a stream of extraordinary news. People consult the chan- ncltr, after all, not only or even particularly for the td'ition of the standard message to meditate, but largely because it's expected the source can pmduce a verbal description of conditions and events beyond the ordinary ken of threedimensional faculties. We consult the channeler because, basically, we are concerned. in a very ordinary conceptual way.

To be fair, some 'channelingn circumstances seem to promote the personal progress of the channeler in gaining dii access to the planes, states, phenomena and degrees of rnind-body integration otherwise only described or verbally charactcfkd by ventriloquist voia-transmission (cf. the Seth material, and the late Jane Robe& occasional description of her personal development in 'inner plane\" understanding). But for the mosf pan, the expressed Ryemat- titude prevails, which amounts to a curious diition between the person of the channeler and the content of the communication resulting pradically in an overall substinuion of the dcsxipuon for the thing described. More immediitely, on the minru side of the phenomenon we end up (in this avalanche of description from various sources) with a collision rather than a smooth confluence of materiak A1 the \"higher\" levels of consciousness not limited to the spacetime frameworkof the blindered channeler, there stillseems to be conten- tion or diiepancy in the respective charaaerhations of real it^ there still seems to be diion regarding that which is perceived or known cwn in these greater and more allegedly comprehensive Domains of Knowing. Any who've scanned more than one of thesc sources in print, or compared notes with \"live\" sessions attended, arc bound to notice (if minimally conscious) that, beneath the ge& agreement as to the adstena of higher states and planes, of different orders of knowledge and action from those assumed in the context of strictly physical expression there is a WIIQ of large and small divergences ranging from minor variations to an embarrassment of glaring contradictions. This is explained in one such source, Co-c R~ehrion 'chan- neled\" by Virpinia kne and Ann Vnlentin, as the inevitable con- dition ofconfusion resulting from the urgent/unprecedented need of the 'higher dimensions\" to discminate changing patterns of infor- mation belonging to \"revamped educational programs\", brought about by thiscriticalepoch of transition through which we're haitant- ly Such confkion aaording to this source results from the requirement of transmission along the spirha1 hiawchy of inner plane beings through which such \"infonnation\", formulated at the highest levels, must pas. CoISisteIIt with what may be g~thed from other swrachannels, the various levek along which the orders of intelligena transmit the flow of data 'downward\" formulate the patterns of infonnation aaording to the understanding of their particular plane.l'inctured already by that qualification, the informa- tion may receive its most noticeable distortion at the level of the channeler where, according to the variable of the given 'linkage\" there may be greater or lesser rcliana on the personal memory- record,conceptual matrix or vocabulary of the channeling agent. The resultant verbal product is, in any case, several dimensional step removed from the originating ~ntention.~Add to this the recognition that all such knowledge emanates in its highest fonn from levels of creative intelligence that are basically non-verbal and that conduct all processes of knowing in abstract spiritual tern not dimly trans- latabk into concepts congenial to a physically-focused framework, and we seem to have on the surfaa a convenient explanation as to why Seth and Hilarion don't agree, why Romtba and the 'Christ\" material of me New Teachings apparently quarrel on the shelves. Hawever, docs this Layered meshwxk of spiritual cheesecloth through which the channeled curds are continuously strained really account for some of the comparative awmalits that, independently, speak with such asured and specific Voice? Let's take a page from the Eesene-V.lcntin material of hie Revebrion; let's listen to the Voices of Whe Rays\" and, like good researchers honoring the strictly scientific method, take them seriously on their own tmns the duration of the expmment in order not to bias the results of testing their hypothe& Accading to 'the Rays\", chefi must be a massive effort on the pan of incarnate teachen (ie. those sharing the embodied amdition and thus the communicative premises of the physical dimedon) of the kvck \"4, 5,6 and 7\" to collate the welter of inmming data, organize it into a coherent corpus of principles, premises aod usable esoteric knowtedge.%c ~ays', in other wbrds, invoke the cooperation of initiated teachers functioning in and through the physical dimension, exhorting any or all such teachers to act as the topper of a cosmic loorn coordinately combing separate strands of starry Material through the distaff. When homver such an Initiated polarity doa respond in the proper Jdentific manner to the call of this experimental hypothesis, something unexpected happens. After all, the Rays' propasitim king in fmt an hvporlusk, a premise to be proved in practia, we arc nor assured before the fact that one element of the resultant quation will go evenly into another without fuss or irrational byproduct. And indeed, it &ms that, by taking Virginia andAnn's '~ays\" upon their own proposal, it is They along with various others that tend to suffer in the ensuing Comparison. If we're going to tackle a task which even a cursory survey will show is proportional to the Purifying of the Augean Stables, we'd be greatly aided with a fit standard of measurement. Gin the premise, it would be bad form to pull out a yardstick that derived from other than the material in question, sine that would be beg the ques- tion and would bring up the additional problem of an extraneous source-verification. If we're going to extract some sufficient standard from the gathered data itself, it should be identifible at the highest level of initiated understanding; its explanation should pair well with the patterns cast by the mast intensely integral and holistic light amilable to initiated consciousness, and if posible should indeed serve to illumine anain details of such patterns beyond that which is already known at the level of ~wakencd~hysical focus, by virtue of its origin in the field of some comparatively unfettered Perspective. Probable Seth There is always of coursc the Suh material, which is the granddaddy of such channeled information and vihich is often ovcr-"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"looked in the turbulent consumerdrive for the new, the novel and the \"up-to-date\". One would hope that metaphyscal principles and deep philosophical pints couldn't be so&ly%scoopcd\"; the Essene material seems to suggest that we're subjea to an information am- over, as if spiritual truths and 'eternal veritiesn showed the newshour brand of tdence on their bovine hnksas they lumbered pest wr post toward the stockyards of instant antiquation. This is indeed all-too-true of much channeled material which frankly seems designed by an otherworldly Madimn Avenue only interested in fashioning the latest catchphrw. What made the Seth material SO noticcable, and what allows it to stand up well today, has much to do with the channeler Jane Roberts herself who-along with the chan- neled tact--narrated a continuous chronicle of her own internal struggle with the whole phctunnenon of channeling, as well as the content of the material. The uniform quality, awistency and in- tegrity of the Seth teachings whichspanned many years (compared to various one-shot sources today) was largely due to the strangeaes and unfamiliarity of such a mode visited upon my cawiouncs at that 'early\" time meeting head on a rationaland intelligent--if aitical and initially quite skeptioll-personality. As Roberto herself states from the perspective of experience, it was indeed the initial dubiety, the deep reservationsaccompanying pea step, the necessary step into a whole new Stage of spiritual progress and development. But in order to have a perspective upon thcveryfiammwk of implit stages in which all such d&lopment takes p&, it no longer suffices to remain with theSdlr material; and although certain other \"channel\" sources have subsequently touched upon the subject, om source alone stands out as a comprehensive ovenricw, agraingwith Andrija Puhnrich's endorsement, we find proper standard and suf- ficient yardstick in the material known as T7teLow Of 0% otherwix known as the Re Channeling. And why should such a designated source show particular superiority over any other? What makes it stand out? Agaii, we'd have to account for its quality by noting the way in which the source was channeled (rather than simply consulting the proclaimed level from which any such source astensibly emanates). Whereas Jane Roberts, for instance, functioned as a one-woman hawk of vigilance in a way which mast modem band-wagon durnnelers manifestly don't, the Ra material was awcientiwhr culled hmn the coonera- tive, &refully coordinated interaction oia minimum of th& h- ticipating personalities, ie., Don Elkins, Carla Rueckm, and James Allen MeCarty. Aawding to their own listed precautions and further commrmuo1ed suggestions, the group used various ritual and formal meditative devices to ensure the purity of the process and also-to ensure protection. For as they were to find out, contrary to much sPccharine communication from the alleged 'beyond\" all is nor neccrcarily well in the real Realm of the Higher Diasions. Theh material, of all chan- neled sources (and as a fine- tuned,'narrow-band\" communication) prcscnua casmic overview both in tenns of the mul- tidirncnsiod stages or \"densities\" of amscious progress in the Soul's awakening to the spiritual holism of the -tor, and the d-lop- mental progmsion of galaxks and planets as evolving vehicles of those densities. Such an overview is enabled by virtue of Rats status as a 'social-memorycomplnt\" of donned a pyramidal duncecap in a moment of pure caprice the the \"6th Density\", a locus of functioning suffiaently congruent in subject became so suddenly Serendipitous Ha to some materializ- alig~lent and integration with the Spiritual Whole characterized as ingentity,quite helpfully clarifying things at the ouwt by announcing '7th Density\", to account for its unique pomr. Its Enlightenment). In considering theSdlr materialasawhole, we can remmmcnd it on the great virtue alonMakcn for granted by now, but quite unique for its initiating the--that it introduced the important key of pohbiliry to the field of psychological dty, thmby Wing the idea from its dusivity as an abstruse phenomenon of physics (oc- cuning-to any significant degm--only at the Heisenberg-indeter- minaq level, fit for the 'position and velocity of elcctroasn but unsuited to strip the material mind from its fixation upon rigid causal conditioning and deterministic hypotheses of action). The Seth dis- cussion of &tidimmiondify and the branching probable paths of CONdous navigation through the wakeanddreamstate served to shift the fulcrum of power to the bristling psychic pent, thereby helping at once to loosen the mental clampof adominant behavioris- tic psychology and to perform a bng.overdue correction to the religio-spiritual emphasis on kma or the imsistible pr#sure of past actions, mnemonic conditioning etc. In this respect then the Srih material served its purpme ad- mirably; and that purpose was to help consciousness lake the naI Other Realities OR the Octave of Ra (Ihc following nunmary of the Ra Teaching parallels rhc dis- come of that IntePgence from the initiated viewpoint, and themfore mpplrments whm n~enaty according to a direct krowlcdgc w in- si@ which findr its decpcst chords of congrwnce with that Mntw as fm as any channeled source of information is concerned). Accordiing to Rn, the units of consciousness that become the developing Soul-vehicle or mindhdylspirit complex evolve through octaves of Creative Expruuon known as densities. There arc seven densities and an infinite subdivision of seven-fold kwls within each density, that ampast a spiritual Octave. The planelsandstar systems exist, m~ltidimeosionally~within and as thevehiclesof these densities, so that for example the sun is not just the physical source of nuclear fusion we know as a materially-focused subject; the sun exists in various state and forms fhmiigh the densities and simply has the radiant appearance we know in our charaaeristic 3rd density field. just as Earth exists at least in potential through all the densities. The movement of the lenticular systems as a multidimensional"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"whole, accounts for the cyclical and coordinate pasage of thevarious suns and stars through \"local regions\" of transformation in which a basic revision of the nuclear material occurs and the peraptual patternsare realigned so as to install the given \"body\" at a prop~~~d density or level. Our solar system, and therefore Earth, is passing through such a transitional spa now, so that our 3rd density planet is in the proccs of transmuting to a 4th density body. The friction that characterizes the maladaptation of 3rd den- sity, materially-focused consciousness as a whole in relation to the more spiritualized or subtle density of the oncoming 4rh, accounts for the manifest difficulty of the transition with its attendant natural and manmade calamities. Obviously, such transitions don't hclw to be so difficult (the Ra entity, for example, describes its 3rd-tMth density transition on the planet Venus millennia ago, as very smooth and harmonious); but the 3rd density consciousness we collectively em- body does represent in the scheme of things a aMin critical Iml. In order to understand the threshold character of that level, and there- fore toappreciate the rquirrmentswe aauallyconfront at this point, it's helpful to atplain here the system of densities asa whole according to the Re account. 'You Are My Density\" (George McFly to Lorraine in Back to the Future) Erst of all it's important to explain just what is meant by \"density\", sine its usc in this material is extremely helpful to our - - understanding once we clearly dittinpkh if from the common usage that allies it with termsof inertia and opacitysynonymouswithstrictly physical existence. Although nowhere in the material itself is the tenn \"density\" sufficiently explained so as to make that distinction, in- itiated intelligence would have you understand \"density\" in the sense of richnos;. the density of a manifesting plane or space is not a calculation of its inertia in this amtext, but to the contrary of its subtlety. It is easier to understand density as the degm of coherent activity, the characteristic \"accommodation\" of a given volume with respect to the perceiving system. The mathematical discipline of sphere-packing is helpful as a concept in grasping this defmition. (I ;ow many oranges can be packed in a crate?) Sphere-packing employs the \"greedy algorithm\" in calculating a pure economy of space and is therefore a very practical help in communications, though it may theoretically work with an infinite number of dimen- sions. \"Density\" is analogous then to a multidimensional sphere-packing the greater the density the more infonnation a given volume codes, the greater the energy-value and richer the potential as which the space is configured. Like the discipline of sphere-packing, the idea of densiry implies a 'geometry of infonna- tion\". For example, we well know the \"W of 3rd density, our present collective plane of focus:\"No two objects can occupy the same space at the same time\". It should be obvious that this is a function of pmepion, for the operative coordiites of perception determine the outline of what's to stand as an object. According to 3rd density focal alignments, the descriptive unik of \"objecthood\" are mutually exclusive and define one another by contrastive polarization. Perception of the essential cohhmnce of all mutually befining, polarized.tenns as an inextricable unity of complementary values, is a function of a higherdensity cognition (or depends on the usc of faculties belonging to the presently recessed planes and ener- gy-systems of the higher densities). Thus when, in the course of spiritual discipline or occult practice performed through this plane we presently peraive a luminous wholeness and basic simultatuy sitia drawn into our frame of reference. In this way we can understand the basic condition that com- priscsa given density. When the Rn material tababout '1st density\" it's talking about the developmental condition of a planetary sphere as it moves through space the highest functional unit of which is capable (in itself) only Of supporting the degm of \"consciousness\" and \"light\" known as mineral. It is, in other words, not yet of a sufficiently rich \"intensity\" or degm of complex energy-organization through any given section of its system to support the minimum. coaxial crosscorrelation of mirroring values indicative of the threshold of sev-consciour being. When the Ra material talks about \"2nd density\", it's talking about a planetary condition the highest functional unit of which is only able in itself to support the degree of consciousncss and light (still therefore a \"subconscious\" degm) known as vegetable, and later animal. Such a density is not in itself of sufficiently rich and subtle composition through any given section of its system to suggest the viability of a self-reflectively conscious axis. . - only the 3rd. densify of planetary development is suffbently rich and symmetrically potentiated tbrough a characteristic nom-scc- tion to imply the patterning of perceptual and cognitive processes belonging to an axis of truly serf-reJktive consciousocs. The 3rd kity degm of self-reflective cooxiousncs is the \"moment\" when the Soul awakens to itself, lirst through the pat- terned mediation of symbolic or representative values It is therefore the 'moment\" when the unit of mnsdousncss becomes aware of itself by a process of modeled apmha&m (ie, the ego-image, the constructed or synthetic 'self\" of the memory-patterns). Its self-rep resentation emphasizes mind as the mediator of consciousness through pekept~ and cognitions; its chief vehicle is the verbalha- tion or abstraa-ima&tic derriDtion of the iaterior monologue. Its immediate potetud, however, is the pure awaremss of consciousness in-itself, without descriptive characterization or pfovis~onal modeling. This is why the 3rd density of consciwsness (i.e. the self-reflec- five capacity of planetary Being) is a critical threshold stage. Its potential clarity with respect to its own oittena alizns it in con- pence with the complete, multidimensional axis of consciousness (this issymbolid in the vertical, bipedal posture of the cenbrcspinal \"trunk\"); for the Wig of consciousness is no longer smcnmfly hiin from itself. It is at this stage only masked by selfassumed patterns of symbolic modeling. Thus the king of consciousness is fiu~cfiono& masked from itself by relative anisometric alignments along the minimally harmonized, globally potentiated mind-body &, but that axis is itself the Line through which the Creative Intelligence of spiritual CMlsciousncss generates and organizes the multidimensional patterns of all the worlds. Raised up in essential congruence with that Line, the potential of 3rd stage self-reflective consciousmv has theoretical access to all the powc&, properties, vehicles and instrumentalities of the densities (lower or higher with respect to its chronic, 3rd-stage focal lockin) according to the functional degm with which it can further integrate and harmonize its pocessing currents efficiently modeling the per- ceprol vocabulary through habit-patterns of identity. that shines lhrough all apparently separate objects (even though in Thus the 3rd density of dous development represents a the field- of tangible perception such objects may penis1 in the very decisive stage in the progrr~ of Soul-realization. In a certain perspectival \"relief\" that makes them appear distinct) we are actually sense the destiny of such development has been shifted into the experiencing a mind-body alignment or momentary, harmonious \"hands\" of self-reflective egou3mhmeg.

Most immediately, the 4th density (characterized by Rn as the . . . density in which are learned the ICSSON of Love and Understanding) calls consciousness, vaguely or urgently according to the quality of attentiveness, to the nrperience of its psychic dimension as the first overt& \"spiritualn tone disclosed to awakening intelligence. From the clarified value of thin density -ling certain secrets of Conscious- nes to itsclf, it is learned just wfry the 3rd level of self-reflection was patterned in wch a way as to initially mask the character of Reality & a spiritual magnitude, substituting a representative alphabet of symbolically modeled \"name and form\". From the parting of the Veil draped arrass the perceptual threshold of 4th density, a distilled sense may be obtained of how pmrious Logoic expcriena with worlds of souldevclopment found such process sknv or positively stagnant, due to the absence of an adequate CRI*~ which might serve to move mind toward active sear& far a deeper Being ultimately commensurate with conscious- nes-in-itself. llIlhus according to Ra the device for the succcedig Logoic pattern was fonnulaled. ie. that of mcmina the value of \"slants\" producing same reorganization Of the mind-body amiu within the framework of the Whole. Yet all such disclasum are, in themsehes, metastabk. They require coostant work in adjusting. shifting and realigning the operative coordinates in oprrimental feedback generating an ongoing \"adventure\" in God-seeking since the given illumination was produced in the fmt place by a fortuitous ratio of interaction among certain emphasized centers and magnetic circuits (dialing one of the \"permissible\" combinations that serves to draw perception a- the minimum requisite threshold of sekct, selfcanalling symmetries). Thus we have the traditional testimony of mystic and sage, the magus, yogi and zen adept each describing a variation on Void-nature sufficiently cnnsistent ad corroborative one with the other as to give rise to the idea of universalism in the match-up of Comparative Religion; and each at the same time characterizing the conditions, the ircdinsabk f~lds or internal rcquircmmts of that Voidnature spi;ituaiinhemce (or void-nature) from the perceptial potentialof in tern sufficiently disparate and uniqueto hegiven c&Wm of 3rd density where consciousness fm takes estimable sock of itself. euum as to mte the dasic contentions and 'dhamambats\" Cubing the Circle Since dimensions are handily debimd by 'mutual perpen- dicularityn,such a screening pees can easily be coaegualiztd with the use of Rubik's Cube. If the perfect harmony, integration and mutual alignment of the tiinsions belonging to the Octave of Densities may be visualized as the Cube rotated at its optimum coherence of color-matched sides, then the screening process (whereby coaxial currents of informationgatterningive \"skewed* so as to distort the view of athence away from direct cognition of maximally symmetrized, selfcancelling Vdd-reality) may k sirnil* understood by seeing what happens when we give the Cube an arbitrary twist. By ~i analogy it may also be understood how there arises a variabk gradation of patterns and multidimenskmal, mordiie- alignments by degms masking or disclosing the mmenal conditioa of Void-nature through the given perceptual field; for just as, in reassembling the optimal alignment of the sides and colored uniw of the Cube may pass through stages of experimental combination each turn of which has multiple repercussionaaos mutually perpen- dicular axes, so too in employing our endommnt of overt and hidden faculties for purpaacs of plumbing the paradoxes perplexing our normal rcalityamsruds we may trigger electrochemical codes aad dormant keys in me magazines of our complex circuits which magi- cally power a differential repertoire of focalcompounds and variabk alignments. Rather than returning immediately to the perfect, global coherence and symmetric croscorrelation of systems indicative of the pattern at perfect \"test\" in its inspiriting Ideal order, we may pas through any number of mediate combinations and organizational variants which, like the tumblers of the Cubeocgsionally matingone or two whole sides may function through panial match-ups, turns of more \"directn integration and alignment which nonethelm from the Aerial View kavc certain unseen phases in relative tier and 'incompletion*. Thus we have, at the 3rd density level and even beyond, the interning circumstance that the spiritual common denominator of Void-value may be known through any number of diplines or indicative ofthe traditions.

Keep- ing in mind that this calculated screening of the direct recognition of Void-reality from 3rd density consciousness is for purposes of 'producing catalyst\", we see that the practical mult of such disguise is the gemration of a necessity for choice.

The implications of this teachiing may come asa shock to many. I:q it dearly indicates that the separative and self-seeking \"delusionn of negative egoity (developmentally pcsible at the kvcl of 3rd-stage screening), is capable heff of achieving a dedicated integration and overall alignment in one-pointed devotion to its own, absorptive aggrandizement which through its polarity is asspiritually potentiated and ripe for \"advance\" as its positive counterpan!

Does this mean that, just at the point u thought we'd shed the shadow of that despoiling antagonis, it looms large once again only amplified by the additional potency belonging inherently to the unsncened higher dimensions? Yesit does. Indeed, such a negative egocomplex must be high in the achievement of such integral intensity and mind-body align- ment of the organizational currents about the illusory nucleus of the separate \"self\", in order to merit such harvestability (just as the pasitively polarized being must exhibit a comparable intensity of alignment); at that requisite degm of hamtable negative polariza- tion, the king must have achieved a certain value ofpPiry of iu lypc. Such purity in the traditions goes by the name of \"demonic\".

In the case of both positive and negative kings of 4th density polarizatioo, the negotiable currency of their transactions is a bb psychic energy; the mode of both is accumulation, in the sense of storing and putting such biopsychic energycapital to work in power- ing or transforming the centers toward deeper integration and func- tional unity. The world of 4th density is an astral webbing through which etheric and physical components organize as the iinsateiilfactory extremity of a total, incarnative Vehicle or bodycomplar; it is there- fore similar to what's experienced through the 'inner planes\" when frddensity consciousnessdistociates in itsPmol6udy. It is a medium surcharged with the symbolizing \"numenn of what we usually as- sociate with the dream state. Yet to the quickened spark of self- reflective awareness struck in that continuum it is a world of perceptual properties as amistent in the laws of their behavim as the perceptions of the material dimension are consistent with rrJpect to their own. Whereas however the 'astral\" is commonly experienced by frddemity consciousness through nocturnal dissociation of the nested inner vehicles as a disembodied state, 4th density represents the coaxial extension of a focalized and Wed-in, incarnative con- sciousnejssweeping the span of milable states fro& the psycho-syrn- bolic to the electron circuit of condensed tactile value we identify as 'physical\". Thus 4th density beings are astral-psychic entities in their optimum degree of awareness, with a physicalcomplex (etectronic) component organized and extended through the patterning align- ments of astroctheric cohesion. The biopsychic energy which con- stitutes the 'negotiable currency\" of 4th density kings, is their natural nutriment. It is not just the 'fleshy leaf' upon which they sup, but the specific value or psychic charge of iu enveloping oslm-efheric atmosphere. Positive 4th density beings achieve greater pd;lrizalbn through aiding the maintenance and peaceful, harmonious hrr- therance of energy-rich spheres such as that of earth where bio- psychic entity of a less advanced stage nonetheless generates tremendous 'loosh\" (in the terminology of Robert Monroe) through the surcharged atmospheres of a self-reflective--and therefore abundantly productivedegm of consciousness and light. me peaceful promotion of a unitive continuity and energy-intensive \"ad- vance\" of such globes, planes and worlds as the physical we know, serves 4th density positive polarization creating as it does a general spread of coherent nodes in the universal net functionally coextensive with social/memory/complar 'bodies\". The 'saucers\" of 4th density, being biomechanical vehides, sewe the group entity in energy-inteusification and enrichment by virtue of their means of propulsion through the 'nutritive menstruum\" of astroctheric atmospheres, in operative continuity with groupbiological configuration. The 'saucer\" is not then an independent tin cann hardware vehicle of the type we knuw, but is rather like a patternuystallization of the group psyche or auric field of its \"pilotsn.

Smerfs-Up: Here Come the Gremmies The Strieber entities make no bones about the pleasure thy derive in causing him stress; juxtaposed against the Andreasan grays, the latter are nearly innocuous. Rather than the apologetic withdrawal and prompt pmvisii of liquid \"balmsn (that induce a kind of overriding bliss) as with the Andmasan entities, the Striekr marauders furnish graphic illustration of what the Rn material describes(acc0rding to abstract principlcr)with respect to the higher- density Negativc Being What then of the seeminglycxcccable, indeed unthinkabk fact that both accounts rcvohe around obduction scenarios which with equal, peremptory efficiency seem to deprive the subject of precisely that* will factor so central to the presemtion of spiritual integrity as outlined in the Rs material?

Hawever, Rn suggestswithout specifying that these apparent psycho- physial 'kidnappings\" do not at their deepesr level violate the fm- will factor, and arc occasionally though not often amskhed to be serviceable in the direction of positive polarization. How can this be? All one really need do is conscientiously compare the respective tern, i.e. Andrcasson's and Striekr's; initiated understanding will furnish the conceptual characterization of what's inevitably intuited or vaguely felt when weighing thee accounts against one another. In the Andmason case, we arc ahvays given the impression that, despite her avert fear and oflen terror at the sheer strangeness of the situation the kings are always doing something of a telepathic or quasi-physical nature to put her at case; there is even the sense. reported by Andreason herself, that at some deep level this h taking placc in conf~ce with her will and not against it, as if in some way it had bnnpramged. In contrast, discomfm of a deliberate kind almost consistently characterizes Strieber's account, and he is made to feel very overtly like a specimen humiliatingly obsemd and manipulated. He is mn laughed at. There is in Striebds case no linderfying sense of complicity, of a prearranged concordance be- ween dimensions of the deeper volitional king perhaps belonging to the planning-boards of Dream and the intensified volitional level of the entities themsehm; rather, there is something much more distressin: 4nd that distressing note develop in the course of Striekr's wnting hi accounts.

Thus Striekr with almost excruciating transparency invokes the standard \"humanistic\" saw to the effect that dichotomies of goad-andcvil are to0 simplistic and medieval, truth ahvays being some \"gray\" blend of opposites; in this way he shields from himself the obvious implications of his ongoing ordeal. But more importantly, he demonstrates to perfectian how one proce- durally \"falls into the handsn of the Negative kings and, by the self-protective mechanisms of 3rddensity psychology engineers a reversal of assurance to the effect that \"good\" things, developmental things positively proceed from such ordealwhereby underwriting a posthiai through the work of hi own will the things which can't be \"taken back\" from the memory-ba& and so seem to require some CoKr sufficiently assuaging of any egodamage done through that quality of helplmncss dripping, like absinthe, from the bitter cup of his plain victimization.

Unable to \"sce\" the Whole whiih nonetheless directly infuws and undersares the negative entities as their very medium, clinging to their foulness like a sweet masking scent, the mind used to dealing only in terms of the representative part is unusually open to making just that identity- quation in which the incidental -on of a F~ld is presumed to contain that field, or is taken as one-to-one equivalent of the quality belonging to the field as a whole.

On page 21 of Volume 111. The tow OjOnr, the Ra entity characterizes a prototypical tactic of the Orion Crusaders, that of \"bidding\"; \"bidding\" is described in such a way as to make it clear that Striekr's experience represents a concrete instance of the phenomenon, a factual case history with which to footnote Ra's words. \"Bidding\" is a contest of will, serviceable in determining the pecking order of the social-memory.complat of the Crusaders, and in rendering the general run of conxiouJness enslaved through intimidated compliance of its own fm wiU. It is a cod of obedience, such as that issued without explanation against Striekr's lust for sweets. Its sole purpase is to bend the subiecl into accepting the command, the actui~cdntenrofthe order being largely beside the point (other than the degm of difficulty invohhd for the subject aocording to the strength of the tendency to be overme, a factor which redounds to the polarization of the \"bidder\"). We find further that any failrvc to exact conformana in 'bidding%ults in a proportional loss of negative pdarity to the aggrrsor, a situation which the entity must then attempt to rectify. In this way we sce that, in terms of the higher densities not only are \"thoughts things\", but the metaphorical relations characterizing the order as which kings functionally interact possess distinct energy values, and have a dim bearing on degree and intensity of po-iion-alignment. TO poses a legion of \"~er~ants\" in these subtle regions is an actual nourishment to the centers and systems, a kind of sic \"foodchain mmid\". At this point a pure bolt of recognition shouldallay any further doubts, either of the type which question the factuality of Strieber's accounts or the kind that quiMcate as to the actual nature of the entitiesimroW, for we find the Striekrentity virtually paraphrasing the earlier Rn recitation re the modus o~erandi that identifies the Negative polarity, in itssuggestion that the failure toagct obediena on the part of the imagizcd \"Crusader\" bears punishable ame- quencc. Not only n this \"narration\" of the viurali scene an ade- quategdmission of the terminvolved, for thosewith prior knowledge as is supplied by the I& dewrim it is a amtinuing illruhation of the way in which the Negative polarity extorts the desired obedience--and thus soul capture-through maoipulation of the Love value belonging impartially to the psychic plane through whiih this largely takes plaa. What then arc we to \"do\" with the counsel of the general Teaching thus far delivered to this density,such as that of \"be thine enemy?\" How are we to interpret such a precept or indeed under- stand the prinapk of Love altogether, when its application seem so susceptible to a sticky, spider web ambush horn plams of reality actually eager with invitation for so innocent an approach? Love Was Ail He Said At this point it's important to understand the way in which a spiritual truth is necessarily rcjkcred into zones of adaptation Prin- ciplesappliibk toone density of~-am'l just outmoded and put aside upon 'stepping up\" to another density. It may however k ncasary to identify the form in which such a principle is recast, according to requirements of a density nearer in direct spirit to the Truth which it express. In this sense, from a perspective that may be characterized as \"4th density\", the appqniate diition of the Love-nature whii serves it most perfectly on all occaskm is that of whole-heed Low of the \"One Injinite &tator\". We may of course readily recognize this \"higher truth\"; it is none other than the Shema of Israel, which Jesus identified with !he heart oithe Law. If then the fust spiritual precept to \"Love God with all ywr heart\" is a familiar reference of 3nf dendy consci-, how is it that such a framework possesses it? And how does such a reference cccxist with corollary commandments and enmmiums, i.e. precisely those such as 'love thine enemies\", \"love your neighbor as yourself\", etc? The general rule, \"Love God\", reaches alike to every density, for it is in its essential character the spontaneous outpouring of the Truth of Life apan from any formulation or customized tailoring. Thus the 3rd density fmly receives it, just as any other, regardless the functional state of understanding. At the 3rd-stage level of egoic self-reference, such a rule incarnates through abstract conceptual distortions practically screening dim cognit& of that Whole which is the real referent of the ruk. In order that such a rule be functionally operative and lid according to its spirit, a level of mind-body integration and harmony is required that abuts the threshold integrity of a '4th density\"; for such a (minimal) state of unitive coherence is able to surpass identified aUegianee to the egodivisive verbal mind. thereby settling into conpena with the actual holism that informs it as reflective expression of the Holism of the Creator.

Even in the case of channeling, however, the character of the Astral origin compels the insinuation of a sign, a kind of confessional sienature no matter how subtle. Indeed this trait of the communica- \" tion is often accepted as a device of mockery suited to the character of the source; it is played with as a defmnt means of asserting the true identity of the Signal, hiding it in plain symbolicsight in confonnana with \"astral\" requirements. This law which insists evcn the physical fonn exhibit \"some sign or characteristic which identifies\" the 'true essenan, is indeed remarked upon by one such channeled source, the Hibrion Material. Hihrion is an entity identified in both the 'Christ\" materials of V. bsene and the Ra channeling, as a being of the positive Hierarchy. Thus when we see boob on the shelf bearing the Hilarion moniker we automatically respond with a beam of recognition. Hilorion's \"channel\" (Maurice 0. Cooke) seems decisively predispoxd to the Christian stream of positive teaching, so we are not particularly surprised when the second half of Ihe Nature of Rraliry (which had up to then been a so-so account of \"esoteric physics\") breaks into a frenzied description of the imminent apocalypse. Indeed, the book ends with a graphic account of destruction and the final torment of souls as they are beaten to their knees in extortion of a \"repentance\" and 'turning to God\" which they'd apparently been reluctant to make even when melting into one another. This uomachchurning peroration was no accident, for in another Hilorion volume, the source prodaims that the structure of the book had been delikratelydesigmd with the\"Armageddonn 1st so as to attract a particular type of \"select\" readership. My, What Big Eyes You Have- With an eye, then, to the Ra account re the way in which the Orions have tnditiona~lysw~bt tosubvert the positivemessagesand meanings of persons or events through emphasizing mmds of doom and destruction, making such negativity a tend feanm of the communication thus deflecting attention into brooding byways of despair, we may turn to the Hi- account of the existena of Negative Beings (or the Dark Brotherhood, in the terms of this source). According to Ililorionb account, the Negative is allawed to exist because its minions act in the ultimately helpful and healthy olpacitvof predatorsthat onlvdccimate the'diseased\" ranb,i.e. like &lf ati&ing the sick or &ngenitally weak specimens of kribou (IIihrioa9s analogy). \"?he wolf attacks these defective caribou, and would never think of wasting its energy trying to chase or bring down healthy specimens. By weeding out the weaker ones, the wolf ensures that the healthy mn&ns stron? With this edifying version of Chris- tian Darwinism. &c are comforted into the notion of our conuitution- al safety (considering the readership of such a work to be ipso fact0 amongst the Elect, an aYunna %en were already given in the gross-out diion of Armageddon). This encouraging information hardly tallies with the outright attack which the Orions launch upon the Ra channelers in the very midst of their activity (see books 11,111 and IV, Thekrwof One); nor does it square well with what initiated knowledge otherwise knows about the effort of the Negative to attack, diedit or physically eliminn~c tha~ who an qrirc pifive& polarized and in no way \"defective\" in the arrogant sense that the IIilarion material propasu. It is also more than pasingly interesting to note that in the film Wolfcn taken from W71ifley Stn'cbcr's book of the same name, the behavior of the predatory CrcaturCS is rationalized in pcckc?, rhc same way, i.e. that they are simply weeding out the rccrement of mankind thereby ultimately strengthening the total stock (the fact that one of the \"good guys\" who evensubscribcs to thts interpretation and is in no way depicted as \"defective\", is nonethelss wantonly massacred by the creatures, attests to Striekr's early powers of schizophrenic dissociation, and gives us as well certain cause to look more deeply into the character of the Hihrion idea). Too Many Plots Spoil the Cooke When we read on that the Dark Brothen are allawed to 'test\" a channel such as Cook (apparently alluding to an early channeling incident that must haw been a source of some distress) by making an apcmcnf of ahange with the \"White Brotherhood\", each bar- gaining some 'deal\" or concession hwn the other, m an squarely on Donald Trumo temtm and about as far awav from the facu of the polaritiesarid ;he densi;iaswecan passibly b;. (The 'Ililorion\" rationalization here is almost selfekkntk a mvtr story. meant to assuage Cooke more than anything else; f& initiated u&rstanding does recognize that a Negative source, having attached to a positive- lydisposcd channel, will pusb the negative hypothesis into increasing- ly more overt cxpr&ns in order to determine how much the malleability of the subject will yield to directly negative propaganda. Apparently at one point Cooke must have been pushed too far, and this absurd scenario was manufactured to explain the cordially adver- sarial relations whereby the Pasitive and Negative players of the higher realms use the channeler's \"inner insuument\" like a Border- land parimutuel window). Wn we read further along how to identily the interference of the \"Dark Brotherhood\", we presently realm we arc being dii- abused of the Sdi teaching (although of course that teaching isn't specifically named due to the punctilious obsc~~tion of that 'Mi Law governing the operation of thae testing faam\"); IIilorion's objection, revealingly enough, has to do with the \"impropriety\" of atplainingcwmic truths of simultaneity and probability to the anthill focus of physical consciousness, which should be properly stuck with the mca culpa considerations of kannic consequences; thus UHilarion\" neatly pivots us buck into proper alignment with all those conventions of cultural cc+itioning that chronically lock us in plaa as a mechanical unit of cause and effect, and away from the elastic efficacy of thepuemf poised at the juncture of potential change. Fmlly, Hilarion regales uswith theawrrana that all \"galactic obscrven\" within the 'region of Earlh\" an neassarily friendly, contrary to the misleading teachings which would have us believe otherwise. \"There is the suggestion that some are distinctly alien and evcn hastile, and that anain of these beings kidnap humansand kill animal life for experimental purposes\". To disabuse us of this base- less notion, YfIilarion\" resorts to no less than the old canard about the inability of any cmlition in the galaxy to devclop interstellar technology until such time as it decisively overcomes all ncga~ive inclination (!). Thus any close encounten, sightings. landink or interactions of a third or fourth kind are necessarily conducted only with the kindliest and most positive of beings Flying With Expired License It is precisely here that those most glaring of contradictions indicative of the channeling phenomenon become inflamed, and virtually fmethemsehes uponour notia .. .right along wit ha viriually stlfdii1osinp. hwothcsis that acrounts for them.

Thus, virtually all"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"'clase enmunten\", reports of abduction etc are of the manifestly negative type. Despite his composed rationalizations, Striekr's ' emotional declarations continue to ring in our ears; and the material gathered into such sources as those of Budd Hopkins, artainly have little of the aura of \"good will\" about them. Then just what could this 'counsel\" of the IIilnrion material pasibly mean? It seems only too evident from this as well as other \"revelationsn of the teaching. that the UHilnrionn source conforms to the methodology of the Crusaders asdisclosed in the Rn Mnterinl, i.e. that of dose adherence to the style, thought and content of pitive sources so as to sneak in \"undercover\" as it wen, and at the point of greatest vulnerability-when the subject isset at hisease and off guard--pour the venom of disinfonnation in the audim channeL (We should be interested to know that 'fake teachers\" can be identified by their appearance, whether they're too fat or too thin, whether they look as if they can be trusted 8n-h yes, whether they've \"mr been hounded through the courts, or banned from any countyn--an interesting criterion, amsidering such an astensibly 'Qlristian\" source. Perhapa the governmental perseartion of true Teachers is a phenomenon confined to the old Roman part.) Taking all this together, we may now identify the very em- phasited oratory of the Hien material on page 26 of Dork Rob- lhwk Bmhm \"SpcdftcaUy, by asserting that one should love one's enemies, Christ presented the single mast effective way to overcome the temotations of Earth life and to confound the whis~eriner of the ark ~ktherhood.\" ~nterestin~ that of all the possible ;ea&ogsand enlighteningwordsof the Christ, this materialshould goout of its way to emphasize the one expression which is mast subject, in such a context, to the diionions of 3rd density thinking patterns. For of all the possible teachings that might effectively have ken drawn upon, the one which lends itself most readily to the snarcs of the Negative poach is precisely thin precept, presumed by a mind-body complex insuffidently unified in congruence with the conscious axis to make the nmssary 4thdensity transferena from the pydmiogid sttuc- turn where &ch impera;i come to lodge, to dkct alignment with the unitive Ground of Being from which lavt streams naturally in all directions without entrapping concern for 'friend ck foe\". - I'm Sorry.,Do You Have Any Credit Cards? Fmlly, there was the case of a student of the initiated tcacbing who, finding the cow signature on the Hilorion bcmks quite intrigu- ing by virtue of its consistent entwining of the heels of the letters 'L\" aid 'A\", decided to apply a ~abala ohumbers whereby, load-be- hold he determined that the deliberately emphasized letters clearly spelt 'IA\" which in Hebrew means 'nothing\" or \"zeron. Sia Zcro is alphabetically an \"On, his eyes automatically transposed that letter over the \"LA\" on the cover signature and, much to his amazement, one of those clever \"astral\" disdosurcs sprang folward, of the type that shw the natural compulsion of the medium to rrveal its character symbolically (as well as the pcnmse delight taken by the Negative in coding its identity in plain sight): HI ONON. (Some of the book covers indeed ~lysepte the letters H and I from the rest, which are arranged-to touch one another so as to group the \"LARION\" with its entwined L and A in om bundle). Indeed the contents of \"Dnrk Robesn etc. (a book, remember, &tt the nega- tive beings) pointed to its own clue in declaring that even all physic;ll things bore the symbolic signature of their particular source. This Is Not the Behavior Of an Ordinary Kitchen Appliance It is necessary to note that the growing public presence of \"negative\" literature (i.e. booksovertly or unknowingly inspired from spiritually-negative sources) is not just the mild circumstance of a 'democratic distribution\" of dim information. The presmce of such material is not innocuous; nor is its active component confined to the personal imbibition of content.

'Ihe idea that negativity or \"evil\" orientation not only survives this plane of blindered ignorance but is capable of holding its own and advancing througb the higher sphms of more overtly spiritualized substance, is not only a distressing notion to many; it is difficult for some to acrrpt on philmophical grounds due to the conventional understanding that \"negativity\" is inherently selfdii and there- fore ultimately dirhcgmn'w, so that the requisite unity consistent with Being through the higher plants is by nature kyond its grasp. Andof course this'understandiing\" holds, in an ultimate sense; as the Ra mald explains, spiritual advana through the Negative Hierarchy reaches the pons asinorum at the mid-point of the 6th densiry, the cutting-off hce just before consdousness merges into unity with the so-called Oversoul or Higher Self. Anywhere prior to that point the inherent defiaencywith respect to negative orientation may have become apparent to the ongoing focus of coosciousms assaying an 'ascent\" by that mode; the upper limit of friction,diion andihis inonition (or-unasimila~e en&&) may have ken grasped as the inbuilt barrier to perfect resolution with the Whole in terms of the Negative tactic 6ut in any case such recognition is inescapable at the threshold of midah density, where the necessary magnitude of Wi as it is made impartially available disclose. the structural impasse auto- matically defining the upper limit of compatibility between the \"unity\" of negative orientation secreted around the false granule of the illusory ego-self, and the uncompromising Unity of Absolute to which that imitative parallelism aspires.

Thus the hole hierarchy of spiritual strata preceding thii point, is capable of king strewn with the litter of relative negative \"waste\" without obligation on the pan of that poisonous processing to dike. When we turn, puzzled, to ask how this may be, we need look no funher than our own 3rd density backyard. Here recent research has found, on behalf of the general Novwck-consciousness, a mcdi- cal evidence not only tending to substantiate aspects of the perennial ~eachin~ regardingthe relation of mind and body, but ripe 4th other implication.

This brings us, in turn, face to face once more with a problem we'd commonly assumed was surpascd once we'd cras~d to the comparatively \"foolproof\" ground of channeling. Crossing the Channel Channeling, after all, seemed to pcsscss a timely-inbuilt sol- vent to a difficulty just recently experienced, LC. the troubles en- countered when in our dawning ecumenicalism we'd presumed the Eastern attitude and opened oursctwJ to the possibility of embodied enlightenment (therefore necessarily exemplified in kme current, incarnate beinn Who could act as the exhibition and dcmonstrabk forerunner of-our own imminent awakening). What was rapidly discovered, (as a genuine or apparent diosure in any particular instance) was that whoever dccfured himself enlightened was not by the sheer magnitude of such announcement necevarily or automat- ically enlightened. This of course led to cormsk distrust regarding the possible, lurking presence of ego behind any agent occupying the same (notoriously ego-riddled) plane as ourself. Embodied, walking-talking Enlightenment was a novelty devoutly to be wished by those whose cultural instruction confined the benefiu of spirituality to an afterlife, and to one historical per- sonage posessing exclusive proprietary rights to the genre; but the barrier to locating the living address of such a sublime state of consciousncv seemed proportionately insurmountable, since the very factor making it so attractive (i.e. the passibility such a Freedom could arise precisely in the heart of ego-territory) was also the factor making its identification lhmrrgh that agency and in that milieu terminally ambiguous. It's for this reason that the phenomenon of channeling, young and marginal in the 7Ck heyday of Esalen, human-potentials, est and Dmne Light Mission inevitably flowered as that hrst hope waned. The prasptct of channeling seemed suddenly made to order. If the Catch-22 of locating Enlightenment-incarnate in \"3rd density\" hinged on the common presence of ego belonging to so low a plane (permitting sheer chicanery to cloud perception) then the obvious answer was to inquire after that Enlightened status only through planes or states of being intrinsically ego fnc, and thus patently safe-by definition-from the subterfuge of self-sewing. The presumption underlying this, of course, took background from our very cultural conditioning through which we'd long learned to make the conventional equation between \"spiritual\" existence and innate beneficence. Naturally we were more than delighted when (ignoring our own new, highly-touted occult discovery re \"like attracting like\") we began apparently receiving 'objective\" comboration of this equation from our contacts with the Other Side. For yes indeed, Seth Spoke and many more followed suit to the effect that \"negativity\" is a subjective mispemption, brought about by the masking opacities of our 3rd density camouflage world and therefore-like a deepsea fish--unable to survive the transition tothe \"upper atmapheres\". Ignore for a moment that Seth actually qualified what was othcnvisc a very emphatic and consistent teaching about the formative pwcr of thought, in a minute passage from Unknown Rrolify in which he proclaimed that \"90% of the time\", encounten with the specter of negativity are purely self-created. Ignore the fact that the exception of mn one all-but-mgligibk percentage point changes the picturedramatically from thewhoksale authorship otherwise espousebignore all that but for the 1- issue as to how it is that Voices speak to us from an apparently Homogenous Beyond, in tones of supreme confidence allowing no room for reservation and still manage to contradict each other as flatly as spokesmen of competing political parties? How is it, we may well ask, that one Voice lulb us with the glamor of a world in which all \"evil\" is reduced toa subjective ignorance that can't withstand the all-absorptive Good composing the inner planes; and another is equally sanguine that the Negative comprises a whole Ontological Orientation, a basically~dintcrprctation of Being adsting inde- pendent of the projection-screens of our privately enveloping auric wall,vouchsafed validity asa polarized univme of implication extend- ing a particularhypothesis of \"unity\" to its logical extreme? And how may we, in our apparently inferior position, posibly discriminate between the two? The usual new-age aft!atus to the effect that both may k \"quallyvalid in their ownspace\", just doesn't sit well, It's for thiswry reason that we turn again to the Ra mamid, as per our method of last month in whii we \"play by Quetnsbeny rules\" and consult the intd mM&me at its highest available source in order to find some resolving principle. In this case, it's mcmary to note the distinction whii Rn makes between the orders of q~~celritne and of rimcJspe (all the densities from Rags Perspective downward are organized in these compkmentafy ways). Aithwgh the Ra rrrmaiol d-m't detail the significance of these organizatioas beyond certain preliminary points, they are cited as categories of amideratian because of what they ncccssarily imply. Through the Looking Glass: The TimelSpace of Our Spaflime We may understand \"spacehime\", first of all, in the tenns we're familiar with We occupy the system of our space/time as a vehicle, (or axial, mind-body locus) through which the coordiites of that system mccsarily arrange all featum according to the require- menu of siam.md@.

In this amten, our limitations are our opportunities; what is filtered through the bottleneck of spacc/time becomesthe focwofwr conccrn,and the material of our resourcefulness in operating through finitizing faculties.

The first is a restatement of Biblical cul- pability. There is however a consequent, internal contradiction of rather significant proponions embedded in the Essene material; for, if the object is to remver the knowledge and status of that spiritual glory existing bcfm our Devdution had been mercifuUy straitjack- eted by the physical body, then it would seem that the ascension m amscbusncs to those higher states of Being betwen incarnations would-in itself-fulfifll the requirement, and would short-circuit any \"returnn to the physical as wholly unnecessary. Obviously, this isn't what Thy mean to imply; for it becomes increasingly evident from the reiterated signsof the material that the \"Raysn intend us to fulfill the alkged initial contract entered upon in \"full (hmhmcs\" with the Divine, as caretakers of Earth, and this absolutely regardless whether we actually rrcover that Glory of Spiritual Awareness as unencumbered Souls. Incidentally, the idea that we progrrssively evolve through the densities as consciousness-units is not equally subject to the charge of \"internal contradiction\" that characterizes the hcne-Rays ac- count; the arpasure of the progressive (or pmxdurallyemlviog) soul to relatively free inner states between incarnations is never held as material is never on Spiritual Awakening per je but -awakeningn to a specific, caretaka rok.

Rome, then was the question of \"Christ Consciousness\", what it was, what it implied. On the modern global scale allowing-and indeed compelling-the prospect of Comparative Religions, the question extends itself toask whether there is a basic difference or fundamental compatibility between \"Christ Consciousness\" and Buddhic or Vedic Realization, the Taoist disclosure etc In order to address such a question, it is ahvays best not to start from the inductive basis and build up, structure against comparative structure, conceptual Nice against conceptual edifice as in the moderndetective manner of piecemeal, cumulative science; for in that way, as we've seen time and again, there's only the spectacle of parallel monoliths aspiring upward in their separateness where lines never really converge except at Infinity4 \"destination\" which is impossible of acccss, definitionally, wherever our point of departure is thefininrde admittedly comprising any inductive, inferential basis. Starting at the oppoJie end in order to get a proper 6x on whatevcr 'Christ Consciousness\" might possibly be, however, poses its own problems Only an initiatic wisdom based on the--nctxssai- ly--global requirement of Initiation as it exists in the present unitary situation of the world, may even hope to evcr take up an adequate station beyond the perspectives that describe the cumnt, codified inventory of \"regional\" esoteric schools, teaching and official religions. Initiated wisdom would have us understand that in order even to begin to recognize what's referred to by the term \"Christ Con- sciousness\", it's necessary to establish the preliminary foundation that provides a servicable acquaintance with the value of Being altogether; for only in Light of the totality of king (i-e. what it is, what it is \"made up of\", what it \"does\" etc) may any such question take confidence in an adequate resolution. Therefore, we can't really begin with the 'finite\"; we hovc to begin with the Infinite, the Unlimited, the Absolute! Know Thy Self-Evident and Irreducible Being (Motto Engraved on the Entrance to the Ruins of the Delphonics' Music Emporium and Late-Night Recording Studio in Culver City) Intuition has always shown our mightiest philosophen and wide-awake being that, regardless the inevitable sense of limitless capre and effusivc non-necessiry that pours off the subject of Ab- solute, there is at the same time a complementary intimation of deep necessi~ there is the wisc sense that Being, onaknown, has self-evi- dently necessary correspondence with its-apprently arbitrary- principles and phenomenal aspects. Being in its Absolute status possess a certain imd~icible value that makes its ultimate \"charac- ter\" wholly ncceuary--an inevitable, self-evident extension and un- deniable conclusion from any given point of departure which necessarily takes its existence in thc first plan in and through that Being. Thus we rmry characterize Absolute value. (despite objections is \"neither Being nor Non-being\" ac can nonethelev be charac- terized quite adequately for our sufficient working comprehension-- for, owing to the ~clf-~drnt or inevicrrble quality of Its ultimate disclosure we may be confident that there is nothing in It which is not also in us. Thus wc 'find\" in It what can be identifed already in us, only extended to its ultimate \"mnclusion\" or irreducible charac- terization. In this way we should be able to make certain positive asser- tions about Absolute-being without thereby in any way delimiting, straitjacketing or 'qualifying\" it; and moreover we should be able to make asscrtionsfrom-the awakened standpoint of the Whole which demonstrate the inm'tabilify clinging to the characterization of Ab- sdute as-for agmpk-Consciousness, Identity and Love (rather than being unable still, despite our meta-physical posture, to surpass the present powcn of physical science to reason why the stuff of existence should be conrciousness as opposed to any of the phenomenal candidates- e.g. the \"imducible panicle\", the single force or element etc). We begin then, significantly, where many other spiritual dis- Cuyions begin, with a Triune formulation of the ultimate \"qualities\" of Absdute-being. In order to understand what \"Christ Conrious- ness\" is, we have to know fm of aU that Absoluteking is a thm-in- one proposition; it may be characterized in tenns of Identity or Self, Love, and Void. The Affinity of Infinity for the Split-Infinitive Where arc the necessary or compelling links between these thm values? and where is the selfcvident comqondence between them and Absolute-being? Fmt of all, anything which is going to be presented authenti- cally as Absolute must be irreducible. This means that it must be everywhere the same as i#e& it cannot be 'other\" than Itself under any conditions including thofc in which an apparent 'other\" may make iu appearance. It is therefore, of necessity, everywhere idetui- cal to lueI/. That which is everywhere the same as or idenricuf to iuey, has to be Idcnriryprrse. Ordinarily when we think of \"identity\", wc think of it as the subject to which are attached the qualifylng pcdicufes framing its protileaf-identification. In this cw hawever Identity is sufficient unto itself without one qualifylng predicate term, or ewn in the paence of any nrch ptetuial tern. Identity is that which is, nctxssaily (sdcna would say \"rigorously\") identical to Itself. Ab- solute Identity is that which remains identical to itself in and ~hroligh all eble conditions That which is infinitely identical to itself, selfconformant to a limitless degm and comple;ely congruent with itself under all condi- tionsdescribes for us the very essence of Sey. Thii Identity is, self-evi- dently, a Se&identify since it is identical to itself under all conditions. That which is infinitely the same as, selfum&ent with or identical to Itself, necessarily comeslo itself in order that such congruence and selfawsistency be considered truly complete. In coming to itself in infinite Selfcongruence with itself. it necessarily apprehends itself as Self-identical to Itself. Thii apprehension is aworrness. It is Self-awarencss--thus \"Identity\" as'a'nonqualifying definition of Absolute is necessarily an Awarencv of its Self-identical character. Momr such awareness from various schkls that beg the question under umbrage of the secrvu that infinite Identity which othemist, in the absena of any ultimately \"ineffablc\", \"indescribable\" or even \"unknmble\" nature such coming-to-itself. would be infinitely dmptkd from taal self- of Absolute-Being) without thereby in any way qtrnIi/j1'ng it.

In a anain sense such creative abundance spings from an internal \"necessity\" of Absdute. We may suppaac from this that Absolute may be 'compelled\". But since It is \"compelled\", in this sense, by something within Ifrelf, we cannot object that It is dimininhed by this \"compulsion\" to something kss than Absolute (as would be the case if that \"necessity\" was imposed upon it by an intrusive principle). Autogenous Parts and Mind-body Work Done Here nnd Now, Only One I.D. Required (Se Habla Espiiol): Sign Seen on Pinstriped Cowbarn in Oxmrd And what is this \"internal necessity? Remember m noted that most theological-metaphysical descriptions have, in deference to Its \"ineffable\" character, attempted to buck into defming Absolute by merely cataloguing or litanmng what It is nor. thus Absolute is usually defined as pure Negation, a fundamental Non-being (i-e. 'Neti, Neti,\" not this, not that etc). Ihs accwnu for om of its cited, tripartite \"attributes\" ie. Void. Absolute is necessarily Void in the sense that It can't be qualified in iu Infinite-unlimited character; but in its homogeneity and infinite Selfcongrumce with Itself, on the other hand, thm is only we Value that cm describe Its Identity . without delimiting or formulating an actual predicate: Void. Being Void, hwvtr, (is. an Absdute-unqualified Non- king) then is only om \"substance\" upon which that absolute-value can work; there n only one referent to its term, and that is the Seq-referent since it isinfmitely consistent withand thesumem, Itself. That Absolute Negation can only be applied, ultimately, to Itself. Whereas in backing descriptively into It, the value of Negation was used to 'banish\" the finite and thus delimited candidates to charac- terization, having succmfully cleared the ground It stands trium- phant as Its onn Sole Refmnr. Thit means of course that It has only Itxlf toward which to aoW Its tenn. This leads us to tht iamous philosophical plopoJition regard- ing the \"Negation of the Negation\", which in fme Heplin fashion never brings us summarily to the starting point, but induces an infinity of intervening 'distance\" betwetn the Value of Negation and itsown Self-ground. The factor of Absolute Non-being, applied to Itself as its orm Sole Referent, can only give rise to Being. only \"trick\" which an absolute, unlimited 'Being\" (i.e. Non-being) can pull out of Its hat, is that of Limitation. 'he only thing which an unqualified Principle can 'do\", is qualify. It anainly needn't 'give rise\" to infinite terms, since It already resides coincident with any such Infinity. This is precisely the philosophical principle coded into Be emblem of the Tibetan \"Diamond-Vajra Void\". The Diamond- Vajra represents explicitly a double-qutivc. The double negative is a self-negation. a cancellation upplied to iuelfso that it apparently widt iuelfgiving rise to the myriad passibititks of bring, i.e. qualifica- tion, conditionality, delimitation etc. The apparent negufion of iuelf, howwr, is a paradaxical prospect. 1ts Glf-negatib can oily behjpahm'crrl; it canonly be the creativepopwition ofan infinite-unlimited Value. It can never result in a ndlllcoilapsc upon,the fmite and delimited, an actual decay into an encapsulated being undergoing infmite degradation; for it is prrcbcly the continued undertying Reality of the Self-Negation of Mute that cradles all tmm of pmisional Wig, that hdds tMm in its Self-cancellimg arms, nurtures and sustains them in Md rhnwrgh Its own continuous Void-character. Indeed Void-being is the only continuous (uninterrupted) value. for as m've seen it is That which is everywhere amistent with ~tself,.infinitely conpent and selfanformait to Itself.

In this way it may be sccn that Absolute-Identity and the phenomena of Creative existence are nor ontililetical. Givcn a suffi- ciently accurate philosophical description of the necessary principles of Being at the outset, we automatically avoid the pitfalls that plague extant descriptions of spiritual and esoteric schools still largely ac- cepted, at face value, as issuing from some \"superior\" viewpoint: i.e. those views running to the effect that Absolute and the overflow an unsatisfactory bifurcation; for now there seems to be no neccsary relation between the Absolute-Being through which we inmitaw rak our being, and the patterning processes of perception and cognition through which we draw our practical description of the world.

For one thing, thii initial recognition contraindicates a sig- nificantly challenging proposition put forward by certain commen- tators throughout history; such a propsition has its most pointed modem application in confounding the hypothevsof'naive realism\" advanced by science, is. the rather shallow, taken-for-granted premise that the descriptive characterization given us of the human nervous-system and the inner composition of the field through which it ark, is necessarily accurate or pa~csscs basicverisimilitude (even though such a dtsaiption inevitably proceeds from the prefigured variables ofa pattern that hands us all its working termsapos~m~on). While such sage obsenfadon undermines the poorly-thought- out confidence ofxience's'naive realism\", it inevitably leaves us with ness characteristic of mankind colkaively, in which we need ork whether there isunynlch thingas an Ultimate,an Absolute (and thus somcrhing&nowub&, in the sense of being an inextricable or apodii- ti~lftvident-value of our Being, rather than something im- pased arbitrarily as a grid-pattern of cognition with no necmary relation). There is havcwr a necessary relation between the creative aspect of Being and Its Absolute status. Sine the creative arises lhrough Absolute-value, it bormws against and presumes m emulate that Value on its own finitizing kvel, for it's everywhere infrued with the incomparable and alldesirabk pdfy of that Whole-Wing as its very Ground. In this way the creative presumes immediately to configure itself according to the inf~te consistency, selfcongruena and absolute selfconformance that characterizes the Supreme Value of Being through which it upsurges; only it mcesJarily has to appropriate such inspiriting Value through the characterizing term of its own limi~mion. Hypostatic Cheesecake, The Baking Dessert of Manifestation (No Matter Which Way You Slice It It Remains In One peace) In thii way we find that the creative value of being configures itself fvst of all as apmrem-of-behg having necessary, Noctic proper- ty. That which is wfic is intrinsically predicated on consciousney, for it athibits pure abstraa rationality. The configuration of creative ulimit\" as a propasition of infinite selfcongruena and consistency through all its (delimiting) aspects neccsarily imparts to it, immedi- ately, an idcntifmbly ided quality. If for arampk a nondimensional point represents for us the quintessential term of Limit, we have to see right away that it's an ideal hypothesis possessing in itself no definitive \"localization\"; m can't pinpoint such a point--it upsurges as a proposition of the creative Value of king seeking to possess the Absolute-status through which it comes t06ionion&on iu own tm (it therefore implicitly seeks to R~~SI~IUIC for that Absdute- status). We can say then that suchan ideal point-proposition comprtscs a sanuufe orpfenmy affirmation of the creatively delimiting Bcing of Absolute Non-king it necevarily arises coincident with itself at all poyiMe \"pointsn of illimitable Being, but in order to do this would therefore seem to upsurge \"besiden itself or ripple selfduplicates of itself in an indefinitely extensive displacement through its own basic ink:-, all such \"smearing\" or diffusion contributing to noth- ing other than its illimitable c~~ency and saneness under all conditions of its creative self-multiplication. It becomes equally evident that wch an undifferentiated, saturate \"plenum\" of the delimiting point-propasition would achim an ideal selfcongruena or limitless consistency when extended along particular dimmtiond axes: Mus the proposition of a lie, a curve of consissent deformation (i.e. circle) etc."},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"We may see from this that a simple Eiiclidem geomeny repre- sents the terms of creative limit in their necessary relation-byderiva- tion from Absolute. \"Euclidean ::romeuy\" isn't one \"type\" of geometry along with hyperbolic ana elliptic etc., but a prototype of the ndc status of creative being. It demonstrates the Mension of the infinite amsistencv. amme& and illimitable self-sameness of Absolute through vjibus planes of delimited being, contrastively polarizing the architectural \"lintels\" of dimensional perpendicularity according to characteristic, coordinate axes (cf. the twistor mathe- matics of Roger Penrase, in which the mapping of minimum binary states into spin-networks produces regular Euclidean angles). Since in Itself this Creative upsurge of Absoluteking has no preferential angle, no perspective, no diiminative \"bias\", we may understand that all such projection of ~ny mative tenn thmgh the wordinate axes defining the \"limits\" of its operative self-consis- tency, takes place according toa universal, indeterminately extensive Symmetry. All \"lines\", then, constituting unitive and coherent idea of a noetic type owing to the rational uniformity and selfconsistency of their defining axes, proliferate as polarized complementaries inf~ng a radial symmetry of saturate, angular intersections.

The \"line\" establishes the minimal basis of defining \"interval\", and thus of the punctuation-mark of discontinuity, contrast, break, inter- ferena etc ' The second great \"circumstana\" whereby Love may be b cated with respect to the necessary relation of Absolute and Its Creative potential, occurs in the process offruvtional diflknthrh through which articulated and contrastive wwkk, king and thing come to full-term expression. Loaning With Compound Interest This occurs at the critical point in which the We Value of Identity (coincident with Absolute-Being) re!khely comes to recog- nize the implication of the creative \"borrowing\" agairw that Value made by the delimited field of existence. For the XI/-same infinite Value of Identity infuses, flows through, and spontaneously inspirits the provisional coordinate conditions of every imitative selfanfor- mance belonging to the tenns of creative limit. W~thout in any way having \"drained\" the infinite reserves of Absolute Identity, all amdi- tional identification-patterns symmetrically proliferating thmgh the creative tremendum exemplify and draw fonvard the whole-value of that Identity in their own, parallel terms.

In the absence of r the meas;rements of relative \"distance\" are nullified, so that the stilVpcaceful residence of such geometrized light-values may be un- derstood as coextensive with 'space\", indeed 'defining\" space at every point.

Thus the limitless Selfcontinuity of Identity when viewed as a Value belonging to the \"created\" map of our mind-body king must be understood with respect to the 'challenge\", sprung from the depths of Its clwn all-potential, presented by the pmnist of Limit. The qrtdan then arixt: how does absdute Identity, in ader to nmain absolute in Its infdte Sclfowtinuity and uninterrupted homogeneity, appear with respect to the potential discmtinuity of creative Limit? We may see that the value of Identity midi mp~t bo the manifesting field of our (multidimensio~l) mind-body pattern, takes on the character of Light. Light isnot fm of all areflccred andindet lumination of some field or plane pr&diag from a source \"removed\" from the thing illumined; Light is the basicand immediate constitution of Identity in relation to its own inbuilt potential for creative limit. It is thus a primordilScr/-ihmhation, a rrvehtion or Selfdisclaure of absolute Identity from within Itself, a natural or \"apodictic\" (xlfeident) unfolding as a respcmk Means Such a Means is the instantaneous ih$7cdon, born from within Iwlf, relative to foml resofttrim of the problematic 'con- frontelion\" between Self-identical Being and Its m creative Limit. The constitution of Absolute Identity as Light (with respect to its internal potential for Limit) has therefore the specificccharacter of Iden. The Original Idea-Man As we've seen, the Self-identical Being of Absolute has the irreducible value of co~cioumess since It must come to Itself in unmcdiited Self-awareness of Its infinite congruence in order to be considered \"absdute\", whole or complete; being conscioumcs in Its by \"Mother Terasu\" (MT) unlimited homogeneity and Self-sameness, It appears as the Light of Idea with respect to its internal potential for interruptive limitation. Thus Light in its ultimate nature is equivalent to Idea. Ikfore it may be interpreted through its m self-organhing pe 'interference\" of flux or rhythm, point or wave, it abides as an innate-born Revelation, an illuminative Sclf.disdaJure of Meanswith respect to the creative \"challenge\" (hidden as fertile seed-potential behind the counic umbilicus of gestative Infinity). Identity beams forth as the Light of Idea with respect to the amnic or creative pattern~f-king; it responds to Its awn internal potential as the instantaneous absi~~~t ~mcp, the thetic \"model\" of Hde. 'W such a proposition of creative lit may be drawn, through the implicating arc of its own presumption, to the rrltimufe seff-c~eelling Jlu~clurc of finite resolution in order to come to itself as inevitable Negation of iu Pkmise. Such Meam shines, with peremptory incandescence, through the instant of Eternity; it spreads into an quivalena with infinitude bmshore toeternal shore, and whiie it enwraps the creative propasi- tion of Limit in the form of Light (thus making Light the first adopruion of Infinity to its own deiimithg premise)at the same time it amprises the inhoiter~c4~:ilidon of the 'Finite\" with the absolute amt&ity and uninterrupted sclfcongruenac of whde-value Iden- tity.

Far from kmg the 'apfusion\", then, of a complex networlr of systems, integrative fields and electromagnetic 'components\", Idea disclases Itself as the smooth origin of all secondary configurn- tiom through which Its reflections may be expcriened. We assume that consciousness and idea can only be the expes- rion of woocsscs that have reached a sophisticated degree of am- plcxity and interaction; we have traced a path of piea&l, scientific \"sleuthing\" in which our detection of the emlatingly mpkx (hwn the vi4it of crude rfsumC) has seemed to J&J&I the Cosmic order of things We sill fail to notice that our complex involuted mapping dm& us, through the enchanted prospect ofunitive mdu- rion, toward an intensification of pdarized patternsand propcnis to the degm ofquipotential identity and thus toward a hypothetically 'smooth point\" at which (on the working model of our flat scale) the tangkd tracings and wildly multiplymg vines of minutely buddtd facets pack so densely into the growingly self-same 'space\" as to become indistinguishable. We move with insIinctual LW for finalizing unity toward the smooth shut of the undifferentiated, on whii all our marlcs and Feynman branches proliferate--in pmgmsive sym- metrically regulating swarm-to ultimate compactness as a single expanse; and yet we allow this Ideal lo exist apan from any identifica- tion with idea itseIf.

We have yet to realm that all fields and grid-patterns (\"complex\" from the pdarncd, perspectival angle of their mabliig mordinatcs) are simply petals of a single Noetic flower, a Self-radiance blooming from the Hean of Wig such that Being, by interpretation, spreads mrywherc as a alcss Ocwn of"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"Rep upon which the Self-resolving Lotus of primordial Idea eternally floats.

Ewry thought, feeling, mood or emotion ever entertained, imbued with a sufficient value of identification and no matter how otherwise dimly conceived constitutes a totalmng \"philosophy\"; every thought regardless how dense or disagreeable represents the self-estimate of the being as which the thought was formulated, and so comprises an implicit ~immation of a whole universe-the universe of irreducible Being as reflected through the unique perspective of the -mlaled pmipient-wnsciousneg.

Clas- sically we can't know anything about this 'ultimate\" Density of Being, apart from what is reflected to \"individuated\" spirit through the planes of manithation from the Barrier of the Qualitative Veils. From those Veils we dimly perceive the suggested outlinc of the inconctivdbk Absolute, embodying and reconciling all paradox that comprises the collf. and problematic pmndutes of every wwld isuing from the Darkness of that \"final Curtain\". If, however, in the enthusiasm of our momentum @ornc on the amfidence that whatever Ultimate Is, we are nat apart from that and It ultimately is \"us\") we imprudently pass beyond- the propriety of traditional silence and keep up the continuity of our Description well onto Taboo Ground, not only breaka milknnial &I in anticipation of a asllectiveadvance of all 'leveLr\"a mchup no matter from what level each praaically procccbr; we dkmcf that Absolute yieldssome imponant consideralions that, regardless how apparently rarefied, necessarily have application at all levels and indeed w'rhour which we remain stuck at the traditional Veil comprising the membrane or 'ring-pasrmt\" of which- encircling Limit we mg, -w- Giwn the Key from that nascbleed eminence of Absdute. however, we diir a significant thing: since Absolute us Ultimate nukarily constitutes the '8th density\" or Spiritual Octave it is nor really the highest of sucnssive levels (which would somehow separate, define and differentiate It over against dl subaltern \"tiers\" of Wig) but like any true Oaave constitutes the resonant summa- tion and arprrssion of the whok from the deepest point of limit and subordinate qualification, sounding that Note to and as the most inclusive Rtsumt. Thus in contemplating that Absolute in which there is by \"defdtionless definition\" no distinction between \"poten- tial\" and 'actual\" etc. we mesarily mnfmnt the Being that is nomeparate from Everything equally, manifest and unmanifest alike. It is not \"different\" from our present, delimited-manifest level, yet at the same time it infinitely surpasses every level and is abstractly removcd from all \"being\" to an inconceivably remote degm. A curious thing happens hwver, when we amtemplate this Absolute; for a logical requirement hues from the innutiw mag- nitude of our strialy rational faculty which, with fidelity, ethocs a truth of ultimate king (sina it is expression and representative reflex of It as globally modelled).

All idea is a unitive formulation of will, a plan or proposition of will. Idea is not indiflerent in its abstraction, but is bristling with Intent. It is fitted with intent from Infinity, and is inseparable from purpose. Therefore Light is first of all, before it is a manifestation of apparently complex parts or divisible attributes, a moveless homogeneity of Intent ?his is why it equeses as a radiance, a purposive intensely \"lineal\" flow, an emphatic emanation.

It's for this reason that the most concrete phenomenon or perceptioa is alnady ideoform; \"in itself\" it isidea, not simply by subjective reflection and secondary, amcq%ual interpretation.

The \"idea\" of a thing models that thing in and as its absence. ?he ideoform character of a phenomenal object is exhibited in and through the instantaneous, non-reflcllive unity as which it's ap prehended. Any such unity is necessarily organized according to the \"absena\" or nonking of the thing dinplaced in its coordinate and definingfield, its supportive context comprising all which it isn't. The unitive disclosure and phenomenal \"identification\" of a thing in all its contingent specificity and peraptual overflow is a function of the negation of altmariw rutities and synthetic patterns-of-identification that can be made on, through or within that \"object\". The \"unity\" of telephone is a volitional and ideoform hnity, since the totalizing pattern in the intent of will draws forward the immediate coherena, intelligibility, meaning and value of \"phone\" through overlapping coordinate variables on which alternative unities can be made.

The property of Limit mn in its illimitablesupemturation and selfcanallation of (differential) mag- nitudes at Inf~ty, asserts itself and pushes itself forward like the subtlest disturbance in the smooth moveless amplitude of Being; and it comprises such gn aggravated assertion precisely because it suffers an inquality of existence through the resolving Value of undifferen- tiated Sameness It therefore represents the very prototype of the all.nrative potential as which Absolute abii in its infinite am- modation and permissiveness.

This Section Should Only Be Read By Those Who Are Deeply Interested In Sex This internal \"strain\" to take birth pr itsclf. experiencing its being as Limitation in the affirmative fomt of limitation, is intuited in various cnsmogonic myths-most notably the Maori creation myth in which it's recited that all beings, matures and things preexisted in the ~ressurized womb and insufferable self-enclosure fonned of the &ic embraa of Rangi and Papa (the interlocked, eternal pr&- tena of Heaven and Eanh); and that the din of all such beings crying to be released into \"free\" creative expression, echoed through Eternity's Halls Since in that stifling embrace (which effectually \"crushed out\" the differential term or hypatatic power of all gods and intermediate beings between the-ontological-range of Heaven and Eanh) nothing could come to hition, the gods rrsdvtd to separate Sky from Ground, it is said that Sky (Rangi) Himself promoted the Means by which Hi children could stretch forward in the luxuriating Space of \"independence\" between the two Great Principles. And indeed we've seen the manner in which the 'SLry\" principle (the absolute Selfcontinuity of Identity as Infinite Con- sciousness) formulates the volitional Meamof such a magical endow- ment in emerging out of Itself as the Light of Idea, the illuminatiw-Logoic proposition with Its imphed Pattern of produc- tive release and redemption. The Maori myth parallels this abstract cosmogony exactly in its imagistic portrayal of the way in which Light came to subsequently shine over the Earth of manifestation fertilely populated with all lhngs. This Section Should Only Be Read By Those Who Want To Learn How A Net Profit Is Made In order for this diierential patterning to anne about, it is as if something \"mw\" and original must be brought fornard from a plenum Absolute rilrrady inconceivably rich with all potential and actual qualities, and beyond which there can be nothing at all sina it accounts for Everything nr itself. Nonetheless this unique or 'novel\" factor .is. atso a potentiality, a sublime power of its unqualifiedly permissive Lirnitlesules Regardless whether that factor seem the problematic confuting of the Infmite pastulate Itself, in Its generous all-acwmmodation Absolute cannot gainsay such a possibility; and indeed as the vey proype of Its creative potential that delimiting factor is Chief amongst Its gods and children. When, out of Its own all-potentiality, Absolute Identity con- ceives the Meam whereby the reificd Value of Limit may be recon- ciled with (and indeed give ultimate Proof to) the uninterrupted Selfcontinuity and Infinite Homogeneity of Absolute-being, It brightens Infinity as the unitive or undifferentiated Light of Idea, the single htantaaeous Means abstracting the Primordial Stroke--the Lightningd+sh or CaunogollK: Ltoc--throu . . gh which all vrs arc brought fornard on the term of their awn unique 'postulates\". and at the same time integrated in cooperalive hammy with the Ab- solute-value by the Graa of which thy take their being.

Thus it may be said that, through the Cosmogonic Act of the One Divine Idea or Logoic proposition, something is \"added\" to the Value of Atsolute which even in the Emtd Arcdrtence at Infinity didn't exist in such a Way before.

By abstracting a volitional Mam of resolving the hyp06- taticvalue ofULimit\" with the IUimitaMe, Identity at the same st& produns the condition in which Limit may be imbued with its own, enabling \"ardusivity\". In this way the all-accommodating. undif- ferentiated embrace of Divine Light cannot simply \"enter into\" the zone of Limit and subsume it by a simple \"lapse\". Iu all-accomrnoda- tion now necessarily accommodates the conmq, ptoposltion of delimited independence. The Infinite Self-Illumination of Divine Idea seems to \"withdraw\" from the discreled region of Limit prrcisely because It is \"too total\" or alltncompassing a Value to \"fit\" the propasition of infhte Restriction; and yet it can't rffoce that propasition since the very abstraction of Iu nottic Means enables it-4e. that Mearrr reqt~ircs the oomponent of \"interrupted\" amsciousness in the form of restrictive \"subconscious\" and 'unanschs\" gnera (the basin of delimited selfcontinuities and coordinate mensions of the naacrr- fwcr weaving the Patternof-being). In this way the \"xparated\" proposition of Limit (comprising the basis of manifestable substance or Prakrit) constitutes Morha whole-stop reduction in density. It establishes the mxkabk value of infinie Wim. It furnishes the funaional limit of resistance or restrictive opacity agam which the abstract Means of creative Wa models the superabundant potential drawn--by Identity-out of the preexistent infinitude of ideoform life. Willing To Relocate Will doesn't find the model of such forms abiding wirhin the Light of Its own Means; It already apprehends their eternal precxis- tena, in the global fulfillment of all aspects to the degm of function- al selfcancellation, through the unsurpassable Plenum of Infinity beyond Its volitional Self-formulation. In reflecting such forms against the enabling resistance of Limit, Will draws fomard their undifferentiated Symmetries in the reductive sratc ofpofe~~al (dii criminating the 'actuality\" of their self-cancelling fulfillments at In- finity) in keeping with Its own ctlaracter as Ideoform Absna~a'on. Since all such forms preexist through eternity in all their pas- sible combinations and relations without distinction as to'befm\" or 'after\" but without the acfruion of \"before\" and 'after\", it can truly be said that Absolute in its ultimate nature is withwt discrimination or qualification, bearing all equally. In contrast to this the smooth, undifferentiated unitv and noctic abstraction of Idmtitv in the form of Light represents a ;ubtkdiffermnbtion from ~bsoluie-in-~tselt It marks the first distinction, even in Its undivided Radiance as Idea Therefore it truly comprises the Means whereby Absolute may tat the Creative hkth&s (preexisting all variety through its-own Being) in establishing the problematic perspmive ofjininufe-in-iue& even out of Its Infinite Essence. , d does this in two ways: by making a \"distinction\" betwnn existence-in-itself (or Limit) and limitedtxistencealnody r~~lwd in Absolute Identiry, it furnishes the ground of a polarking tension; a subtle diipancy intrudes which ah~s the potential of existence- in-itself to be \"liberatedn from iu indiscriminate coariuence at In- finitywith all Value equally. At the same time, by creating the basis of a practical j~umposirion between Limit and Absolute Identity, it provides the ground for the reflective thesis of the Ideoform Resolu- tion of Identity with respect to the proposal of \"Limitation-in-Itself\", so limitation may be furnished the hypothetical contcp~ in which it can \"live out\" its premise. The abstract Means (prucntina Itself in the Ideoform homogeneityof Infinite Light)'k formilating the Will that recon- ciles the creative-limited with the noa-manifest Limitless subtly ser- Ksat the same time torcduce the indiinate plenum of Absolute to a \"dry proposition\". This \"abstraaion\" of Absolute in the form of Idea is then like a Desert of undifferentiated Self-iuminance. It has no internal richness of dibk pans; but it has the Will to draw the potential configuratioas of ideofonn worlds and king from their pmmtent residency as a saturate plenumof 'penpeaives\" outfitted with their various ready-made labels, am and dimional in- dicators.

In sodoing, the vigor of limitless expression belonging to Absolute is \"transcribed\", with respect to the Resolving Hypofhuic of the Lihe (of Volitional Light), as the reflective and symmetrically splayed patterns flawing hleidos- copiully fror? the \"plane of pointillit profusion\" in the field of Limit. (We may visualie this with referena to someone writing at a desk, an image to which the Qabalists resort in referring to Metatron, the Archangel of the Pmna transcribing the destiny of souk and universes in the Ledger of Life. The Line of Light may be analogous to the Pen which writes; the \"ideas\" of the various king that wind up imprinted on the manifesting Parchment aren't contained in the Pen, but flow through Its enabling instrumentality from the Mind of the writer.) This then is the moment of creative upsurge in the 'plan\" or pattern of the One Idea. It may be recognized as the casmogonic juncture (beyond \"time\", \"spacen etc.) at which the creative amplitude of Infinite Being with all Its worlds, beings and things abiding beyond distinction of potential and actual is p~ctically or- dered with respect to the integrative and nsohring Line. pa %r- tical\" line may be recognized as the cerebrospinal column in flat physical terms, the Hindu susumna or Theosophical sutratma, the Qabalitic Middle Pir etc.) Wherein The Line Makes Its Point Although the \"universal comrergena-point\" in the symmetric resolution and selfcanallation of ~rythiing exists \"everywhere\"- indiscriminately-beneath the diffracting Gaze of the reflexive Line of Light, the absolute volitional prerogative of that Line under the abstract Wisdom of Its Resolving Hypothesis (Logoic Idea) estab- lies a specific point. Through the total freedom of Its Will cm- bedded in the basic indeterminacy of Void-Being, Line establishes (by crcntivc Fiat, by sheer volitional \"caprice\") a principal pm, a fundamental Radix of universal resolution through which It polarizes the extent of Its multidimensional Axis. With that declared Point (the Self-identical Heart of Being) established as the Mean through which the reflective term of Identity would come to Itself on a definitive basis witti respect to he delimiting Iyplhes~ of lhe crenliw pttem of Being, all other quipotential point-propositions could function as similar but not identical tenns of resolution on a relative basis, existingat varying functional diian- ccs'\"from\" that universal Mean of the transdimensional Axis or Line of Light. Each such point could function as a resohring void-locus of a specialized pattern operating near (in tenns of ontological \"dis- tana\") but not coincident with the universal Void-locus of the transdimensional Axis Thus we may visualize a plenum distribution of such resolving void-points functioning as the convergent mean of innumerable pat- terns, indiitinguishable in themselves or from the Heart-locus of the total Patternaf-Being ercep with respect to the all-important, ar- bitrary if absolutizing Fit of Line (which, by drawing its Axis of polarization through that ponict~hr Point establishes all the distinc- tions, and indeed makes the differences in the various patterns drawn through the locus of particular points a dirrct firncrion of their relative4ntological-diitana from the Median Term). The innumerable points clustered about the antral Axis with Its fundamental Coordinate Point may k considered loci of many pryrcllu integrated through, but not coincident with, the resolving Mean of that Ax& they may be amsidered the.quintc~sena, the virtual \"void-navekn of rich intemovcn forms posscsing diite identities and at the same time coinhering, overlapping through numberlev other patte-hic matrices through which arc reflectively organized in crystalline mas-hatch the coordinate net- work of Garnet and Orchid, Lynxand Benzene, Pitch and Redwood. Yet aU such differential form of any such patterning process takes its specific (organizational) being and context from the filtrate gnd-network of canpound, polanzed perceptual keys organized through thevariable coordinate loci diiributcdalongtheantral Axis of Being (the transdimensional susumna or cerebrospinal column) and having their Common Denominator in the Median Point of that Arris, the Heart established in the Middle by Logoic Fiat of Line.

Each such possible pattern receives the enabling mglr (whereby a matrix of diff?renfiul perception and functional operation is drawn into relief) through the 'objective\" lens of com- p&nd focal triangulation along the central, multidimensional Con- scious Axis drawing Its potential typologies into relative expression (cf. Part I). The antral, transdimensional Line is the operative deter- minant in the polarization of a particular, functional network of patterns and processes through the perceptual plane out of the \"stationary\" global assemblages of creative potential, all potential patterns are integrated mast coherently through, and wuh rcspec~ lo, that Line. All saturate potential of the compound-focal coordinates aligning variable geometries in the patterning grid-networks of per- aption, is diffmnrially fi11ered and pdarizcd through the elastic discriminations and \"undetermined determinations\" of Line, the Axis of Volition. From the optimum integrity and volitional variability of Line (the antraling Self-axis of Being), logoic typologies organize the multidimensional current or patterning process of manifestation as a whole. This wholecurrent lypology along the antral Axis serves to filter and align 'mnemonic\" flowchannels of recursive, automatic- or subconxi-rdinate grids (the synaptic \"typologies\" of the ceml nervous system and responsive patterns of the aritonomic"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"nerve networks, at the level of physical 'crass-section\"); through the irradiating junctures and polarizing \"pyramid-points\" of those coor- dinate gnds, the cumnts of subconscious magnetism-or 'fluid vital forcen--characterizing the pattern of the nature field draw the cor- responding alignment of planes and angles from the 'stationary\" or dense-floating global assemblages of patterning potential abiding as the innumerable point-loci indirectly comlated with the Central Channel.

It may be said then that the 'substance\" of the Di Idea is intelligence. Si it ir Idea and therefore abstract hypothesis recon- aling actual rams, it must be conceived as having rrrbnmce or \"materia\" (as oppased to mndwsnus-in-itself which is Beyond all tenns, hypotheses, qualifications etc) although such \"wbtance\" is smooth and singular. In contradistinction to the abstraa \"materia\" or intelligent substance of Idea, the patterndf-Beingwhich isimplied in the Idea arprrsses the state of nature-matter. As the panernof- being it manifests the potential of inertia, fesismce, opacity and self-enfolded limit. Thus its ideoform coherence and pokizcd in- tegrity reflect not simply the response of Absdute-Identity to the potential of Limit within ItselS it manifests the value of that Idmtity when, in Its ideoform holism as Light, It pennits the validity and integrity of the proposition of Limit as a functional reality and con- fronu it, in effect, us an exteriorizing quality beyond the selfam- sonancc of Its substance. Ihe patternof-Being which spreads through Infinity beneath the reflective Light of Identity, takes its point of departure from the principle of Limit \"in itself\" and therefore from the primordial, contractile 'centrism\" or hypothetical ser/~)~cfo~c of the non- dimensional \"Point-being\".

To apply these 'words' one must think and feel and choose to implement them in one's day-in and day-out existence, both consciously and meditatively for best results. These . metaphysical principles not only are the single 'most powerful weapon against malevolent alien incursions on Earth, but make the entire issue of alien incursions a moot one, relegated to minor if nonexistent impact in one's life. There are no actual techniques presented here, only the 'bareboner* knowledge and truth maps themselves in most concise possible form. The 0 best suggestion for using experiential techniques in conjunction with these truths in u'l order to make them live and breathe in a conscious manner by one's own free will, is Cr( to: 1) be willing to intricately think about 00 what is stated here, 2) explore one's feelings about it, and 3) discover where one currently I stands in relation to these truths compared to where 4) one wants to be. That is the key dm ' structure of relating fully to the knowledge maps. Understanding them only intellectually as possibilities keeps them flat and interesting but not truly impactful. These truths can be inunensely powerful or just more fancy and cutely arranged words for the bookshelf or intellectual curiosity. If one is strongly interested in technique and does not know whak to do specifically, and want.s more help, the best source the authors know of today is from a small group called Concept:Synergy, located in Florida, USA (address mentioned earlier in this report). The authors have, over the last two decades for purposes of private sector scientific research for major educational and potential objective technology ramifications, carefully experienced, examined, anslysad, investigated, and correlated just about every technique, group, cult, school of thought, practice, old and new religion and occult school, metaphysical study, guru, movement, philosophy, psychology, counter-culture, cybernetic epistemology, medical practice and educational source there is. It 80 happens that the final conclusion is that the most powerful sources of metaphysical information come from this particular mentioned source. It is clearly head and shoulders above the rest in several respects. However, it's still not for everybody, so do what you want and feel is right for yourself. By the way, coincidentally, this below data almost totally correlates with what the Heier connected Pleiadeans have stated and discussed relating to metaphysical concerns, but to appreciate the Heier relayed information is of course an independently valuable trail of learning. The Heier Pleiadeans materials are just the best noff-planet' physical extraterrestrial source of metaphysical knowledge discovered and verified so far. However, and this is critically important, ultimately the best source for these things is yourself. Its just that we been very confused by the morass of delusion and falsity parading as truth for thousands of years, so we have in many ways damaged our ability to discern. To gauge your own capacity to grow and evolve, however, is very often assisted by checking our the best the world around you does have to offer - ar long as it doesn't come with covert or overt control, enslavement and brainwashing rtrings attached. So here we go. Starting with the very basics: A11 creational/universal processes have seven rteps. These steps can be termed in words as: 1. locus (Point of beginning) 2. Submtanca (Timeless issue in essence) 3. Corm (Spatial structure) 4. Determinatioo (Point of manifestation) 5. Oodarmtandiog (Heta-spatial structure - conceptual) 6.

Often when the mind cannot fathom the order of the process in question it is made clear and understandable by remembering these seven key words, or ones similar. In fact, anything in life, from the smallest to the largest and most significant, from emotional to mental, from material to spiritual, business to pleasure can be understood in these seven quantum 'stepped8 terms. In addition, it can be valuable to understand that any process of seven steps also has internal correspondances as well: The 4th step in any process is the most determined, And the the 4th step is its own energy frequency. The 7th step is the higher octave frequency oscillation of the 1st step. The 6th step is the higher octave frequency oscillation of the 2nd step. The 5th step is the higher octave frequency oscillation of the 3rd step. These correspondances are found in the nature of the time/space wave interaction which is the same at the corresponding subperiod points in the 7th wrsud Why does all this work out this way? Actually for reasons found in quantum physics, spatio- temporal dynamics, mathematics and group theory, topology dynamics, cybernetics and elsewhere. Like the 'golden means and 'fibonacci series* phenomena in nature, it functions universally in everything. This subject alone could encompass an entire book.

Anything that moves and changes has seven (7) steps. Anything that is static and does not change has four (4) structured form. In this way we can unfold the seven actions of love into a somewhat more detailed explanation and description, which unfolding could continue almost indefinitely such that it would begin to couple back into itself, but at different layers of holo- semantic detail and reference. Each level of actions of love are tangible, discernible and logical, although maybe not linearly logical and more often exponentially logical in holographic metaphorical manner. The fundamental requirement for love to exist with its seven actions and its seven potential provisions as detailed above is for \"impacta to exist in the universe. For impact to exist, one must allow a11 that is which ultimately is created by oneself to exist as real beyond ones creating it. That means, everyone is not just a figment of your imagination and that you are the only one and fundamentally alone, but rather that there are other beings which are real, who can impact you, either positively or negatively in your reality. Impact can be both positive and negative, constructive or destructive, hurt or help. Uith 'impact' existing as a fundamental reality, there can be a god or a goddess, a friend, an enemy.

With the help of a clear a full elucidation and explanation of the truth and her detailed understandings into a form that can be practiced in daily life, such of these maps can be built to show people how to transform from the negative character to the positive character. This of course is a beautiful to undertake. However, given the extreme resistance that human beings and institutions of belief and negative character have from the fear of being eliminated or even opposed, it is clear that the advanced creational/universal truths will not be appreciated or understood as really important by most peoples in the near future. Yet it is possible to have many people learn the basics. Whether one functions in a positive or negative mode or set of structures, processes and reality, there are some common fabric between them. Each being, whether human, alien, godly or primitive has the same fundamental properties of free will, gifted to each as souls within the creation from the beginning. These can be described as LAU and LQQI.S we have to shape the raw materials, whether in a positive or negative manner and form: We should realize that all we have is the 7 raw material8 of our 1.

No being no matter what level in evolution or spirituality has any more raw materials or tools. However it is clear that aome beings are far more adept in working their tools and shaping their raw materials than others. We must then begin to analyse what we have done with these raw materials and these precious tools, and with the power of the logic of truth and in honest humility to the true awesome beauty of it all, we can chart a course or build a bridge to move from negative to positive human and spiritual character, in what ways the material and spiritual developments can come into harmony for any human who honestly wants to grow and evolve beyond the limitations of the physical universe and it associated worlds and semi- spiritual stratifications.

What actually happens is that each one of us is already owning a small piece of the ultimate spiritual energy and consciousness that is God and Goddess and All that Is, and there is much that is beyond us as well in those domains and possibilities. As we grow we become more and more of who we can be, never losing a single bit of the positive and valuable uniqueness that we have been are or will become. As that expands, eventually, yes, eventually we can have full relationship with that God/Goddess/All that Is that we came from originally and which has continued to grow 8s well since we were first birthed as individual souls.

The report focuses on the one central issue that binds these two threads into one inseparable cord that can tow the line of all these disparate challenges to sanity and freedom. That cord is the exploration and command of spiritual forces resident within each human being that can directly influence and even control the two original threaded issues. Finally, the value of the cord towing the line of social, psychological, political, alien and religious influences and controls in effect on this planet is distilled into a discourse of \"truth maps\" relating to the essence of human and universal spirituality. This mapping process reveals the essential tensions at a refined level between the natural course of spiritual evolution and the components of resistance to such evolution. The outcome of these rather distilled spiritual truths being mapped is several back reflective inferences provided for much of the report : 1. The focused essence of the 'good-evil* or 'malevalent-benevolente patterning as a function of 'proe and 'con* orientations relating to love and its evolutionary expansions. 2. The nature of a substantial and impactful process of *spiritualityv as an available evolutionary advancement which supercedes and *controlsm much of the problems associated with aliens and mind control and physical/social control detailed in this report. 3. The undiluted maps of truth without manipulative power strings attached providing the ability to properly navigate the complex forms of negative and limiting beliefs, systems, intentions, processes, and strategies associated with political, religious and social control and suppression systems. 4. The practice of one's own spirituality as a living breathing dynamic of taking responsibility for one's creative and controlling powers to shape one's destiny according to self determination by right, and not other's determination by might. 5. The development of wisdom and understanding that allows an effective means to put rather fearful freedom impeding activities on the part of aliens and human social structures alike into contexts of larger truths that pin down these negative power potentials to a level that can be coped with and ultimately fully managed and transcended by the 'little' individual. 6. The re-ordering of one's individual life and spirit to defuse the negative potentials as they are seeded or programmed within one's own conscious, subconscious, unconscious realms to effectively disconnect any possible attractive and fueling forces to the possible negative potentials that have existed on a social and global level.

It is treated as if multiple opposing and incompatible truths can co-exist, which for many minds may not be possible. 2. \"ET's\" are approached as existing, real entities, which are in the habit of visiting and \"messing around\" with Earth and its inhabitants. Existing ET's are treated as being the real extraterrestrial type, the physically effective interdimensional and human unconscious mind projected types. 3. \"CW-12\", or something like it, it treated as being real and bona fide, with a number of directives supported by a powerful secret infrastructure. It now has a different name. 4. The \"Billy Meier Casen is treated as being real and bona fide, and his Pleiadean contacts and beamships as being real and having happened as he relates in over 2000 pages of contact conversation transcripts. 5. The William Cooper materials as related in Linda Hove's book \"An Alien Harvest\" are treated as being essentially true and correct. 6. The William Cooper (my 09) *Secret Government\" manuscript and the John Lear (December 07) \"letter\" are treated as being essentially true, albeit certain statements within are also treated as being incorrect and synthesized by Cooper's mind. 7. William Moore, Stanton Friedman, Jamie Shandera, Phil Klass, and others are treated as being knowing or unwitting secret government operatives, which may be totally incorrect and unfair, however they are assumed as such anyway based on other's analyses and the authors analysis and information. Speaking of which, in the November 89 Mufon Journal wherein Moore does a valiant job 'clearingD himself and 'di 'editing' the Bennewitz case as holding any water is either a mest and therefore he is being maligned in this report, or b) an excellent job of back paddling on his blown cover. 8. Human 'free will\" and \"spiritualitya and \"choice\" is treated as being extremely powerful and capable of creating whatever it wants, including multiple dimensional Earths if necessary to acconunodate human spiritual choice and free determination. Tools and maps relating to the same are limited to being developed from just a few \"good sources\", which \"goodness\" is entirely in the opinion of the authors of this report. These tools and maps are however nonsecular and considered to be universal. 9.

Hatonn and Sananda and Ashtar and their \"scribe\" Dhsrma, though no longer directly mentioned, are generally treated as being bogus and the mad ravings of a psychotic who may occasionally be channeling some real aliens but probably not. The previous revision of this report gave them more airtime and 'reality'. This revision cuts out most a11 the airtime to them, and only refers to the fact that there is a lot of 'Christian aliene stuff going around which could impact peoples perception of real bona tide aliens. The idea of Christian aliens and such aupposed alien's ideas are central to much human collective unconscious archetypal symbolic language, and as such may be real and sincere from their origin and its points of reference. 11. The existence of a secret government which is dedicated to the management of the alien reality is assumed. This government is so cloistered in multiple layers of secrecy and decoy and suppression that very few actually are aware of it in the government except for those compartmentalized and isolated groups primarily associated with black military programs of the .highest orders of secrecy which are not funded through standard black military program congressionally approved funding. 12. The secret government's use of disinformation, debunking, ridicule, and malignment of bona fide ET and UFO information and contacts is assumed to be occurring. It is assumed this activity is mostly effected remotely by unwitting operatives who are fed counterdata and counterbeliefs suitable for the doing the job in a highly layered disclosure mechanism. Deniability is the single most important mandate in this mechanism. 13. There are assumed to be three types of aliens - benevolent, neutral and malevolent aliens, when in actual fact they may not, be so easily classified, and there may be more gradations than '+', '-*, 'O', and the classification may radically change depending on which context of reference is used (see wdefinitions\" section)."},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 CHAPTER 9 Gd Sremuw : ONE WORLV ORbE R OUTLI NE - I.

None of the material between pages 540 through 690 is seen as absolute \"fact\", and should be related to your own personal experience and knowledge. It is being present- ed simply because it exists, and may shed some light in your consciousness about planetary events. No specific aspect of what is contained in those pages is deemed by the author to be indicative of a specific probable reality to follow; all of it should be examined in the light of your own consciousness. There is no doubt that there exist many hierarchies of \"planned actions and activities that are contrived covertly\", which is to \"conspire\". There also is no doubt that these activities revolve around the factors of money, power and drugs. Any activity that exists in these areas is performed by those who operate with their consciousness in negatively-oriented polarities through the lower brain structures. In that sense, it is understood WHY they are doing what they are doing. You must endeavor to understand everything that is occuring in a cultural sense from a higher perspective in consiousness - not to do so would result in your being trapped in a tunnel reality where you would, like the majority of human beings, remain in a state of perpetual fear and self- induced vulnerability. To assure that the material is viewed from this aspect,'YOU MUST READ AND COMPREHEND THE MATERIAL IN CHAPTER 8 BEFORE YOU READ PAGES 540 THROUGH 690.

Dictatorship/Monarchy - rule by one. Oligarchy - rule by a few. Democracy - rule by the majority. Anarchy is a form of government that is a transitional one that appears between the collapse of one form and the assumption of another form. It is generally true that even a dictatorship or monarchy is run by a small, ruling minority; a dictatorship and a democracy are in truth oligarchical forms of government, since they are in truth run by a sma1l.number of elite, so the previous list can be reduced to various forms of oligarchical governments with spurious cases of anarchy in between. The only true form of government, then, is actually an oligarchy, rule by a minority. What is a democracy? It is the form of government that is passed off as \"the only true workable form of government\" to the people on the planet. A Democracy, by definition (1928), is: A government of the masses, where authority is derived through mass meeting or any form of direct expression. The attitude toward law is that the \"will of the majority shall regulate, whether it be based upon deliberation or governed by passion, prejudice, and impulse, without restraint or regard to consequence; it eventually results in demagogism, agitation, discontent, and finally anarchy.\" If democracies are in truth oligarchies, where the minority rules, is there a form of government that protects both minority and majority rights? Yes. It is called a Republic, where the power rests in a written constitution, wherein the powers of the government are limited so that the people retain the maximum amount of power themselves. When unscrupulous individuals manipulate a democracy, which is a shaky situation to begin with, it can turn into anarchy very quickly. The popular belief systems of the majority can be turned against groups of people. Alexander"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Hamilton was aware of this tendency for a democratic form of government of government to be torn apart by itself, and he was once quoted as saying: \"We are now forming a republican form of government. Real liberty is not found in the extremes of demo- cracy, but in moderate governments. If we incline too much to democracy, we shall soon shoot into a monarchy or some form of dictatorship.\" It should be obvious by now that democracy leads toward tyranny. Let's examine the original list in another way: Democracy - Might makes right. Law restricts people. Republic - Right makes Might. Law restricts government. In terms of the current conditions existing in the U.S., the original republican form of government has been under- mined for the last 100 years, converting it into an interest- ing mix of democracy and socialism. The process of conversion appears to parallel programs which have been proposed for a transition to socialism (remember that fascists are national socialists): Step 1: Infiltrate the existing government. Step 2: Create real or alleged grievances, through either an action or inaction by the infiltrated gov't. Step 3: Create a \"mob rule\" situation through the real or alleged grievance where the populace demands that the created problem will be solved through government \"action\". Step 4: The infiltrated government proposes remedies through oppressive legislation. Step 5: Repeat Steps 2 through 4. The legislation that is passed does not solve the \"problem\" and the people demand more and more legislation until the government becomes totalitarian in nature by possessing all the power. Total power is the ultimate goal for the creation of situations that the populace perceive as \"problems\". Once the infiltrated government maintains control over the money supply, energy, and food, it has total control over a populace that has been coerced into a state of total disempowerment; this reflects the current cultural situation (or the way it is developing) on the planet. Some of the \"problems\" that are levied on the populace appear as \"internal\" threats (drugs, crime, and various events that imply social instability that cry out for increased levels of oppressive legislation) and \"external\" threats (invasion by extra-terrestrials, asteroid impacts, the fictitious 'cold war',etc). All of the \"problems\" are constructed in such a way that they fragment and divide the population and set it against itself (which, for a population that functions within the lower neurological brain"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 structures, is easy to do) and tends to focus on sociological concerns which relate to the primary trip7et of security, sensation and power (the reflective of the triplet is In- security, Isolation and Disempowerment). Each triplet is the other triplet unmanifested but present as an implicit un- conscious principle that can be manipulated in what is basically an unconscious, unaware population. Back to forms of government. The five principles that were mentioned before were used by Adolph Hitler (not forgetting of course that the forces which supported the rise of national socialism in Germany have their origin within the United States and the elite of Europe) and are being applied every- where on the planet as you read this book. After the United States essentially went bankrupt in 1938, the property and people of the U.S. were pledged to the world bankers as collateral; a parallel development has been happening relative to the environment. If you take a trip to the Smokey Mountain National Park, you will see a sign outside the park that says that the park is part of the \"World Conservation Bank\", or something very similar to that. What has been happening is that debt-ridden countries (the U.S. owes the most to the world bankers) have been signing over their lands to the world bankers in an attempt to offset their debt. It is rumored that Price Charles, for example, now owns the whole Amazon basin. Don't take my word for it - check it out for yourself. A major factor that must be taken into consideration when evaluating forms of government is how they view material goods : CAPITAL GOODS Economic System Owned BY Controlled BY: Free Enterprise Private Owners Private Owners Commun i sm The State The State Fasci sm Private Owners The State Social ism The State The State In viewing the above, you can see why you do not actually own anything in the United States. The State maintains the actual \"title\" to your car and your land. You maintain a type of secondary \"title\" to your car and a \"warranty deed\" to your land. If you actually OWNED your land, you would not be liable for property taxes on it. Research indicates that there are over 60 different ways that you, as a \"citizen\" establish what are called \"adhesion contracts\" with the government, both state and federal, in which you essentially agree to dis- empower your own authority. However, we could go on forever about the nuances of adhesion contracts - it lies outside the scope of this book. 05394"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"MATRIX III According to some sources, three distinct forces are apparent on this planet: \"The Christ Force\" \"The Luciferian Force\" \"The Ahrimanic or Satanic Force\" Now, recall that a11 these forces have their origin within consciousness. All of them represent One force used in three distinct ways. You have an essence of what the Christ force aspect means (read the piece by Michael Topper). The Lucifer- ian aspect is one that suits the NWO purpose (the NWO repre- sents the Ahrimanic Force) because it is inherent as a distracter for humans, the purpose being to keep the focus of humans on everything but who they are, as well as knowledge that will enable them to progress in consciousness. In truth, this is the main tenet of individuals like Zbigniew Brzezinski who, in their published works, view the mass populace as nothing more than cattle who need to be amused and kept busy (ironically, because of the inherent structure of society that .is in place, people are encouraged to put themselves in exactly that situation, both sociologically and in conscious- ness ) . As far as the Ahrimanic Force is concerned, there are ways in which they influence, control, and suppress human society: 1. Promote situations where higher conceptual ideals of \"soul\" and \"spirit\" are downplayed by \"official\" \"science\". 2. Promote situations where humans are inspired to hold contempt, suspicion and antagonism toward anything that leads to genuinely spiritual considerations. 3. Promote idolatry of goods and services. 4. Promote perversion of cultural life so that nothing is deemed worthwhile \"unless it puts food on the table\". 5. Promote a physically-oriented social consciousness that maintains a tunnel-reality that precludes the existence of anything outside the senses of the physical body. 6. Promote concepts and actions which divide humanity and set it against itself. 7. Promote ceaseless \"political\" strife in which both \"sides\" of various issues fail to recognize that within their own reality-tunnels their ideas are of equal value and equally justifiable. 8.

The list could go on. Where is YOUR consciousness? What brain structures are YOU using? If you are not CONSCIOUS, when are you going to WAKE UP? If you are happy with the \"status quo\", then you deserve everything involved with it, don't you? Time and time again, it has been repeated to you that the key to it all is CONSCIOUSNESS. CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE NAME OF THE GAME, EVERYWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE. GET CONSCIOUS, GET AWARE, TAKE YOUR POWER BACK AND LIVE LIFE!! One thing to never forget is that THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS INHERENTLY PRESENT IN ANYTHING THAT YOU SHOULD FEAR. FEAR IS THE KEY TO MANIPULATION OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT CONSCIOUS.

If there is nothing in nature that develops before it is needed or used, then why do you have it there?

War, especially world war, is far more than just a military maneuver; it also has economic, social, and political ramifications. Certainly, the Allies won a military victory over the Nazis. but that is all that is certain. Nithin only forty years after World War 11. the economy of both Germany and Japan was much stronger than that of the United States, Britain, and Russia, who fared far worse in the wake of what is generally accepted as their victory. This chapter will explore some of the political and social ramifications of the second, and hopefully the last, world war. Anyone who knows anything about 20th century history will recognize this chapter's title as the salutation that opened and closed nearly every communication in Germany's Third Reich. but what does the average American really know about this group that nearly conquered the world? Surprisingly, very little. Volumes have been written on the subject but few have taken the time to read even basic primers like The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, as such histories are ------ tedious in their detail. Public opinion of the Nazis has been drawn largely from motion pictures, newsreels. documentaries and articles that are too often subjective, one-dimensional propaganda. Since the story of Jonestown has its roots in Nazi Germany, to understand the full impact of the experiment some common misconceptions about the Nazis must first be dispelled. Contrary to the widely accepted belief, the Nazis were not anti-Semitic, they were pro-Aryan and there is a distinct difference. The fair-skinned. predominantly blue-eyed, blondes of Nordic descent were heralded as the master race while all others were considered sub-human. The Nazis did murder six million Jews in the Holocaust, but they also murdered an additional six million Slavs. gypsies, intellectuals, drug addicts, criminals. communists, and homosexuals. The only reason that Jews dominated the ranks of the oppressed is that they dominated the sub-human population in Europe. Had the Nazis risen to power in, for example Africa. Blacks and not Jews would have been murdered en masse. The 1936 Olympics, held in Berlin, is a prime example of the Nazis' attitude toward Blacks. Germany"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 proudly presented its finest Aryan athletes like Luz Long, who carried the honor of the master race but who was repeatedly defeated by the Black American. Jesse Owens. The German press called Owens and other Black athletes \"auxiliaries\" and \"little more than trained baboons\" Hitler exemplified the official Nazi position by refusing to congratulate Owens after he won an unprecedented four gold medals in the competition. Though it is rarely portrayed as one, World War I1 was a race war, or at least the Nazis perceived it as such. The Allies. on the other hand. were fighting a traditional border war in which geography or nationalicy dictated whether the citizenry was friend or foe. To the Nazis, the enemy was not the United States or Russia but the sub-humans, some of whom were in their own country of Germany, others in Europe and others still in the U.S. and Russia. Likewise, the Nazis' alliance was with the master race living everywhere not just in Germany. As the German Army conquered more and more of Europe for \"Aryan living space,\" many of the occupied peoples were classified sub-human and sent to the concentration camps while many of Aryan heritage were rewarded and welcomed into the Third Reich. While the Allies were fighting countries, the Nazis were fighting people, and this basic conceptual difference permitted both sides to win. The Allies won a military victory over Germany. but Germany won a social and political victory over the United States where their philosophy was embraced by many German-Americans (who today comprise the largest ethnic group in the country). This story begins in an intra-structure of the Nazi Party known as the Sachutzstaffel or simply as the SS. The SS was forsed in 1926 with 280 charter members whose original function was to guard Adolf Hitler. After two rather ineffective leaders, Hitler appointed Heinrich Himmler, a quiet, mild-sannered poultry farmer and expert genetic engineer, as Reichsfuhrer SS. Under Himmler, the SS grew in nunbers and prestige both before and after 1334, when it was made an independent faction of the Nazi Party. Enrollment had increased to 30.000 members recruited from Germany. Austria. Norway. Denmark and France. They were the elite of the master race and the heroes of every aspiring German boy who dreamed of the day that he too could wear the black SS uniform with its stylized twin lightning bolt emblem. The tight-fitting uniform was also cause for young girls to dream."},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 The SS was so diversified as to defy a simple description. They were not a military unit, per se, though Himmler did establish an armored division known as the Waffen SS whose primary function was, not to engage in battle but, to follow the German Army and reorganize the conquered countries. They also served as very impressive parade troops. Furthermore, Himmler established an intelligence gathering division as the Security Service of the SS or Sicherheitsdienst (S.D.) as the Nazi spy ring was called. Himmler also organized Germany's sixteen police forces into the Gestapo under his command. Another SS division, identified by their skull and cross-bones emblem, was charged with managing the several concentration camps set up in old German factories soon after the SS became a separate entity in 1934. One of the SS tasks was to implement Himmler's plan to purify the Aryan race in the first 125 years oi his proposed \"Thousand year Reich.\" Their plan was two-fold; eliminate the sub-humans and procreate the master race. Himmler would breed the Germans as he had bred chickens on his poultry farm. The SS might best be described as a fraternity whose varied membership that numbered in the hundreds of thousands by the outbreak of World War 11, took the following oath, I swear to thee. Adolf Hitler, loyalty and bravery. I vow to thee and to the superiors whom thou snail appoint, obedience until death. It was Heinrich Himmler's SS, and not the German people or even the German military, that was solely responsible for tne Xazi atrocities. One of tne most bizarre and insightful activities of the SS was to scour the world in search of any and all knowledge of the occult and psychic phenomena. Though Hitler's and Himmler's interest in the occult has long been reported. the influence the occult exerted on their careers bas never been fully appreciated. Soon after Yorld War I. Hitler joined a numoer of German occult lodges, most notably the Thule Gesellschaft. a coven that delved into the Black Arts, requlred its members to abstain from alcohol and meat (to ennance their necromancy rites) and preached a doctrine of Aryan superiority under an ancient Tibetan symbol: the swastika. Obviously, the experience had a ' profound effect on Hitler. It has -been proposed that"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"MATRIX III Hitler intended to appoint himself as God upon conquering the world and this was the source of his obsession with the occult. From African voodoo priests to Himalayan monks, from Christianity to letterology, every religion, sect or cult present in the world as well as in recorded history was closely scrutinized by the SS. They attempted to compile the most comprehensive study of man's spiritual experience and to a large extent they succeeded. By 1937, Himmler had bled the German occult lodges for all that they had to teach so he outlawed them in order to eliminate anyone who possessed even a fraction of his knowledge. Covens, such as the A.-.A*-. and the O.T.O. were disbanded. The principal figure in both was Aleister Crowley who regarded the Nazis,as \"Creatures of Christianity\" for their persecution of the Jews. Hitler did report in Mein Kampf that, as a young student in the Benedictine Monastery in Lamback, he dreamed of one day being ordained a priest. To this day, his relationship with the Catholic Church remains a very controversial issue. They never excommunicated him; not even posthumously. Hitler and Himmler were the foremost authorities on the occult in the world and perhaps even in the history of the world and ,the following is presented as an example of the extent of their knowledge. Their basic discovery, or rather redis- covery, was the one dogma common to all religious beliefs, man is an energy force in a physical body. Primitives called it a spirit. Christians call it a soul and portray their saints as having a nimbus or halo about their head. To a Hindu, it is an aura or astral body and their gods and goddesses are depicted as being surrounded by a glowing energy field. Many people in the past and present claim to have the ability to see this rainbow-like aura that surrounds every person and attests to his character as well as his physical and mental state. Regardless of how different cultures view the aura, most all agree that it exists and is crucial to life as the absence of it is the true definition of death. Perhaps Himmler's initial interest in the aura was to develop new techniques to separate body and soul that could kill without bullets or poisons, but his research was to take a different course.

Because calcium ions con- trol muscle contractions. autonomic responses. neurotransmitters, and many aspects of cellular metabolism, even smdl alterations m their achons can cause a biochemical reaction. Another suggestion is that the pineal gland. the bdfs master gland that controls the \"brological clock,\" is attuned to fluctuations ot the natural electromagnetic fields created by the Earth's poles. Outs~de interference from manmade radiation may thus scramble these elrxtrical sign-&. Because life dweloped within the radiation of the Earth's geomagnetic field, our cells and calcium-depen- dent enzyme systems are exnemely susceptible to any alteration in this basic environniental condition.

After thuty years. otficals have stiU not disclosed the reason tor the em- bassy irradiation. Results of blood tests on embassy workers remain classified as well. but monkeys have been expcrimentallv apsed to the same levels of m.crowave energy. One monkey in the tests fell into a deep stupor after ten davs and did not rwiw until all irradiation ceased. Those who say nonionizing radia- tion cannot possibly have anv effect may be able to dispute the negative fears that some scientists have, but it is less easv to deny the positive find- ings. which have been documented for a longer time. Orthopedic sur- geons haw long been awan that elec- tromagnetic impulses of the nght fre- quency promote tissue proliferation. thus accelerating healing of bone f~actures. Stubborn tendinitis. low back pain. bums. skin wounds. and wen epilepsy have responded. Cumntlv, over I20 million televi- sion receivers and six million micro- wave ovens are in use in America alone. not to mention the innumer- able power lines and radio. televi- sion. and telephone hansmitters. If you are feeling a little powerless in the face of all these invisible waves. do not despair. Research is raprdlv contirming the profound effects ot nonionizing radiation. so there is hope that it will no longer be IK- nored, but controlled. In the meantime. what can you do to protect yourself? First. keep the electromagnetic level of vour house- hold low. Avoid unnecessuy gadget- ry, keeping your home and kitchen manual where possible. Elechomag- netic radiation does not easily travel far from its source unless purposely focused to do so; at least yvu can con- trol the environment in vour own home. Of course. it's best not to live llirectly under power lines either. Nonionuing radiation seems to target the immune system. the nerves. the brain. and the glands. Nutrients that smngthen these svs- tems are essential protection. Vita- mins C. E. and A are antioxidants that buttress the cells against biolog- ical attack. The B-vitains. especial- ly stress-specific pantothenic acid and choline, guard the nerves. If vou must venture into highly energ~zed environments. avoid eating sugary foods. Nonionizing radiation tends to derange insulin production so that blood susar problems will be inten- sified. In time. perhaps eleztromagnettc energy will be harnessed. becoming not a threat but an aid to greater health. - L,"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS - INFORMATION SHEET Evidence exists which suggests that excessive exposure to electric and magnetic fields 0 may pose a risk to human health. This evidence has been derived from three distinctly different types of studies. These studies are: - Cellular level studies - Whole animal or human studies - Epidemiologic studies (studies of human populations) These different types of studies have shown that: 1. Exposures to electric and magnetic fields can cause changes in the flow of certain ions through cell membranes. 2. Exposures to electric fields can alter the rhythmic activity cycle that naturally occurs in most organisms. 3. Exposures to electric and magnetic fields may cause abnormal embryo development in animals under specific circumstances. 4. Exposures to electric and magnetic fields have &own a positive (but weak) association with certain types of cancer in epidemiologic studies. Because this field of research is new, the evidence for these effects is by no means conclusive. Some or all of the above findings may change in the near future. However, after reviewing what is currently known about exposure to electromagnetic fields, the Washington State Department of Health. believes that this is an issue of concern. Because of this concern, the Department recommends adopting a policy of prudent avoidance. A policy of prudent avoidance means taking reasonable action to limit exposure to electromagnetic fields. On the individual level, people may want to limit prolonged exposure to known sources of high fields. For example, because there is close body contact throughout the night, use of electric blankets or electrically heated waterbeds that produce high fields should be limited. On the other hand, appliances that are used for short periods of time (such as eiectric shavers) pose less of a concern. We believe, however, that it is too early to recommend extensive changes to lifestyle or residence since we do not know if these changes would be beneficial or even necessary. On a broader level, the Department of Health feels that uJd develop strategies for prudent avoidance that will reduce exposure to the consuming public. The pamphlet, \"Electricand Magnetic Fields from 60 Hertz Electric Power: What do we know about possible health risks?\", written by Dr. Granger Morgan at the Carnegie Mellon Institute, describes further what is meant by a policy of prudent avoidance. It also provides an explanation in non-technical language of what is known and not known about potential health risks associated with exposure to EMF.

Data for making these comparisons were generated by the Electric Transmission Research Needs Task Force with the assistance of the Technical Committee. The Task Force and Technical Committee identi- fied a range of parameters which would affect electric and magnetic field suength. then pqared field projections based upon altering these param- eters. First. \"base case\" designs for both transmission and for disuibution were defined. Next. several transmission and distribution alternatives wen identified and compand to the base cases. Altema- tives were developed within the separate categories of transmission. distribution rhrw-phase. and disuibution single-phase. Alternatives within each category were suuctured to be capable of deliver- ing equal amounts of power. Electric and magnetic field projections were made using computer softwart developed by Vernon Chartier of the Bonneville Power Administration and Dr. Robert Olsen from Washington State University. These programs are in common use and provide accurate results provided line current and geometry are known. The results of this exercise are presented in rhc following pages, including a discussion of assumptions. description of alternatives, compara- tive field projections and observations from these comparisons. Cost estimates for each alternative are also provided. ~nsmission Line Design Numerous conductor and suppon (pole or tower) configurations are used for high voltage tramis- sion systems. It has long been known that different conductor configurations create substantially different electric and magnetic fields in both magnitude and shape (Moore). To demonstrate these differences. ten alternatives capable of delivering 125 megawatts (MW) of elccuical power are described on the following pages. (This amount of power is about one-tenth the average power used by Seattle.) These altematives art not all inclusive. but represent a range of available techniques for reducing EMF. relative to one another. Comparison of the general magnitude of these differences, when weighed against other considerations such as cost. maintenance facton and reliability. gives one insight inm the relative value (in field reduction) of incorporating cenain measurn into line design. Unbalance on transmission systems is typically much lower than on diuibution systems. It has been found thar the range of unbalance on tram- mission lines generally does not conuibute signifi- dy to the magnetic fields pduced. For the purpose of this analysis, it is assumed that there is around 5% current amplitude variation, and a two degree phase angle variation of unbalance on transmission systems.

When comparing overhead alternatives. the highest magnetic and lowest electric fields result when voltage is reduced, the amount of power delivery remaining constant. 3. Conversely, of dl the overhead alternatives, increasing the voltage results in the highest elcctric fields. and lower magnetic fields. assuming equal power delivery. 4. The greatest field reductions are accomplished by undergrounding transmission lines in a steel pipe filled with fluid. Electric fields are eliminated and magnetic fields are reduced from 29.7 mG (base case) to 0.2 mG. calcu- lated at forty feet away from the centerline in each case. This panicular*underground alterna- tive also results in reduced magnetic fields when comparing field strengths immediately under the base case line (59.6 mG) and above the underground line (4.9 mG). The magnetic field reduction is due to cancellation from the phase spacing and not shielding. The cost of this type of consuuction is estimated to be six to seven and one-half times more than the base case depending on the particular circumstance. 5. Next to undergrounding. the greatest magnetic . field reductions are achieved using either a double circuir/split phase or multiphase ar- rangement The double cimit/split phase arrangement achieves magnetic field reduc- tions of around 4 to 16 times, by comparison to the base case. depending on the point of measurement. The multiphase design achieves magnetic field reductions of around 3.6 to 4.4 times. by comparison to the base case, depend- ing on the point of measurement. The costs of these altematives are estimated to be 53% greater than the base case for the split phase altemative and 69% greater for the multiphase alternative. 6. The two delta type configurations examined achieve very similar magnetic field reductions when compared to the base case, that is. a magnetic field reduction on the order of approximately 2 to 3 times in either case, depending on the point of measurement. These alternatives are comparable in cost to the base case. Distribution Line Design Magnetic fields from didbution systems can be more complicated than those mund high-voltage transmission lines because there are sometimes two circuits, a higher voltage primary and a lower voltage secondary which connects to customer equipment. The net cum flow (the non-zero vector sum of all cumnts flowing on all the conductors) mults in an uncancc11ed (or net) magnetic field component (Moore). Net current results when not all of the ENm cum flows on the lines but instead, a portion flows in the eanh. Net cumnt can also result when low-voltage retum currents from customer loads disperst through ground connections and do not ruum on the neutral wires from the house to the distribution uansform- en (Moore). Thc magnetic field fmm net cumm falls off less rapidly with distance from the lines than magnetic fields from a set of conductors carrying no net current.'

Other things remaining the same. a double circuitlsplit phase results in the greatest mag- netic field reduction. This is uuc even when comparing to the underground distribution alternatives studied. Also, magnetic fields from this design are much less than magnetic fields for the single phase alternative studied. even though the power delivered is nine timcs Electric and Magnetic Field Reduction: Research Needs"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"greater for the three-phase (6.5 MW versus 0.72 MW). This design could have application where an express feeder is run from a substa- tion to a load area It would become unbal- anced and be less effective for general distribu- tion lines where connections are made along its length to serve customers. 2. Single-phase disuibution generally produces greater magnetic fields for the amount of power delivered. For example, a three-phase compact delta line designed to deliver 6.5 MW products a 4.9 mG field 40 feet away versus a 6.4 mG field from the single-phase headpin alternative. delivering only .72 MW. 3. The second most effective means by which to reduce magnetic fields from disuibution lines appears to be doubling the primary distribution voltage (see Alternative \"C', Horizomal Delta) which reduces the fields to about 40% of the base case magnetic field at 40 feet 4. The compact delta design reduces the magnetic field to about 63% of the base case at 40 feet 5. Undergrounding a the-phase distribution line reduces the magnetic field to between 57% to 6 1 % of the base case at 40 feet (see Altema- tives \"F'. Double CircuitJSplit Phase and Alternative \"G\". Multiphase, respectively). In other words, undergrounding is no more effective than use of the compact delta (see above) and is more costly. Undergrounding also resul~~ in higher fields than other alterna- tives directly overlunder the line. Table 3 shows a mge of 3 12 mG to 56;3 mG for underground versus 3.3 mG to 22.4 mG for overhead at 0 feet from the center line. 6. Magnetic fields from distribution lines can be relatively greater for the amount of power delivered than transmission lines due to the amount of unbalance in the distribution system. the close proximity to ground level where the fields are measured. and the amount of earth return current. If we assume 20% current amplitude variation. and 50% eanh return on LhC distribution system. a 12.5 kV. 300 amp double circuit/split phase distribution line produces an estimated mean value magnetic field of 2.5 mG 40 feet away, by comparison to a 230 kV, 300 amp circuit/split phase transmis- sion line field of 4.8 mG at the same distance; when the uansmission line is delivering 19 times as much power. Additional Observations General Observations Electric and magnetic fields arc a function of voltage and net currcru on a line. geometry of the line. and distance from a line. The most common single circuit transmission structure in the United States is the flat. horizontal configuration. This design resulrs in the highest electric and magnetic fields.

Electric field shield wires can be strung between energized conductors and the ground. resulting in a significant reduction in electric fields at certain locations. Also, most houses and other buildings are very good shields. Lines using single conductors can yield signifi- cantly lower electric fields (as much as 25%) ' than lines using bundled conductors, but they produce higher audible and radio noise. nlngnelic Fields Magnetic fields are directly reiatcd to the customers' use of electricity and varies hourly and seasonally with living patterns. The use of two or more transmission or distri- bution lines. when one transmission or distri- bution line would normally be used. results in lower magnetic fields near each line. given the same total power delivery. The use of more substations with lower current distribution lines would result in lower mag- netic fields near each line. for the same amount of power delivered. Magnetic fields fmm distribution lines may decrease more rapidly with distance than magnetic fields from transmission lines be- cause of their close conductor spacing. Much of the magnetic field attributed to distribution lines comes from unbalanced currents between phase conductors and from split cunents from neutral-ground bonds to other grounding systems, such as water piping systems. Degaussing loops along the right-of-way have been proposed for reducing magnetic fields. but so far. practical methods for their use have not been developed or tested. Certain types of undergmund construction can reduce magnetic fields from transmission lines except at distances very close to the line. The lines can be placed very close together and some attenuation is also produced by the heavy steel pipe used in high pressure fluid filied underground transmission systems. This type of system is not currently being used for distribution because, among other things. the net current produces ficlds, whether the pipe is present or not. The multiphase line and double-circuit/split phase transmission line alternatives can rcduce magnetic fields to about amund 50% that of the two delta configured lines. Thcse are lines with more than three phases that transmit the same amount of power as normal single-circuit three-phase lines.

Two U.S. psychics, former UN diplomat Ingo Swann and former Burbank police cheif Patrick Price, were involved with Scanate, which was at the time one of the most closely guarded Pentagon projects. Price died under mysterious circumstances, leaving Swann to continue his psychic research at SRI under a low profile. Stanford did a study for the Air Force, called the \"Advanced Technique Threat Assessment\", classified Top Secret, which.detailed the entire spectrum of psychic weaponry .at the .t-ime. .In 1979, Rep.Char1es Rose of the House Intelligence Committee went so far as to demand a congressional investigation of U.S. psychic prepared- ness. Rose claimed to have witnessed Swann and others in action. Today, not a word about this issue is mentioned by Rose or any other congressional member. The Terminal Man A Senate report entitled \"Behavior Modification\" revealed that the CIA funded work done at UCLA to develop microwave broadcasting equipment which could carry human voices into a person's head for the purpose of inducing hypnosis at a distance. In the 1950'~~ another center tied to UCLA main- tained a program which involved an \"amnesia beam\" for CIA use in domestic and foreign covert operations. Mind Control and the White House Since mind control has apparently been a basic substrate of scientific endeavor for the last 40 years, it is no surprise that proponents of mind control techniques have taken their place beside American presidents. President's Nixon and Ford were advised by Dr. Anold Hutschnecker, a 1926 graduate of the Nazi-supported Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, where much of the early medical and psychiatric techniques involved in mind control were pioneered. During Carters administration, Dr. Peter Borne prescribed hypnotic drugs to White House staffers and some cabinet members. Fi naci a1 consultant and investigative journalist Dr. Harry Schult has speculated that Bourne's control of the Carter White House may have resulted in some unusual policy decisions. It was during Carter's administration that FEMA was born. Perhaps the greatest champion of Brzezinski's techno- tronic mind controlled America is Dr. Louis J. West. Dr. West was involved with Air Force brainwashing programs and MKULTRA work for the CIA, and proposed converting a former Nike missle base into an electronic mind control compound. He received a great deal of support from Ronald Reagan when Reagan was the governor of California. Some of the mind-boggling proposals 0 4 19-Q"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 that have their origin with Dr. West are chemical castration, implantation of transponders in the sexual organs and the brain, biological control of menstrual cycles to control crime (try to figure that one out!), and eventual replacement of the U.S.\"legal system\" witha system of psychiatric control. Today, Dr. West continues his activities as the Director of the Neuropsychiatric Institute at UCLA, no doubt with the full support of President and \"ex\" CIA director George Bush. At Pentagon DARPA laboratories, biocyberneticist Dr. Craig Fields, according to a 1978 interview, was hard at work with the development of techniques for electronically controlling mass populations. In fact, from the very beginning, members of the American Medical Association and American Psychiatric Association have participated in programs which use public funding to create a national mind control network. Their own documents prove their goal - to robotize the United States. The mind control programs under development at UCLA are now being supplemented with newer programs at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories in New Mexico, the home of the atom bomb. Project River Styx Weapons developed under the U.S. Army Project River Styx program were among the first prototypal electromagnetic weapons. The Styx weapons were used to grossly degrade bodily functions of the brain, the eyes, and the sex organs. According to the Army, \"there are paraphysical advantages that may accrue to the United States and allied nations from the early realization of military applications of these effects.\" Research indicates that the Army was involved in this type of work as early as 1957; it is obvious why this work is kept from public view. According to one Pentagon study, the Army has conducted microwave experiments which produced third degree burns on subjects at Fort Know in Kentucky. Corporate research has paralleled military research. General Electric, who has been involved in the development of anti-personnel microwave weapons, participated in Project Comet, which delved into the psychological effects of electromagnetic radiation between radio waves and microwaves. Of course, the main mover behind all types of hideous research, as always, appears to be the Office of Naval Research."},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 .

At Holmesburg Sute Prison in Philadelphia volunwn were used to test a particularly violent incapacitating drug. Around the same time as these tests were being conducted by the CIA the US Army initiated two projects. THIRD CIIANCE and DERBY HAT. They conducted experiments both home ud abod, and at one time the New York State Psychiatric Institute war conducting research unda contract to the Army. Betwten 1955 and 1958 the Army also tested LSD on 1.000 volunteer US saviamur at Rn Bragg and the Army's Chemical Warfare lrboFPtaies at Edgewood. MKDEL TA This operation focused on the interrogation of people who were srapefted as being fmign agents spyi~~g upon US insullahns. or rdve Americans suspected of bemg foreign agents. Much of the testing was conducted off the Amaican mainland in CIA safe housa and American ocarpii war zones.

Schumann, playing around with math as physicists are prone to do, postulated that thc earth - bcing a good conductor - was surrounded by a good dialccmc called air. And around his is another layer of a good conductor known as the ionosphere, thc Heaviside Layer, and hat this conslilules a potcntially resonant system. That mcans that any encrgy trapped in this earth-ionosphere cavity - like lightning storms, etc., - will cause it to ring like a bell. But the surprise was that this signal frequency was the idcntical consciousness, or whcthcr hc is making it up as hc gocs along. If we look at these curves at 8 Hz, 7.8 Hz, thcre is a tremendous node in the earth's brain wave. There's anothcr one at about 14 Hz, etc. Amazing!

What if the ancient people realized that on certain days of the year, (the solstices, the equinoxes, etc), these frequencies change? And what if the priesthood decided to build observntories like Stonehenp and the ones all over Central and South America, Europe and England - to predict these so the people could be either freed or implanted all over again.

This information is supplementary to that in Chapter 7. The Interviews Where do you want to start? Let's start with the Phoenix Project. It was a project that evolved out of the Philadelphia Project. It was a project that the Navy did in the 1930's and 1940's in an attempt to make ships invisible. They threw the switch one eventful day and the ship went into hyperspace. They had all sorts of problems with the people on the boat. It was a huge success as well as a huge failure - then they shelved it, Around 1947 it was decided to re-activate the project and i t was moved to Brookhaven National Laboratories with Dr. John Von Neumann and his associates. ut of Phoenix 1 came Stealth technology, which I cannot talk about because of my job. It also produced all sorts of energetic little toys like the radiosonde. What is a radiosonde? Well, in all appearances it was a little white box that they attached to a balloon and sent up into the atmosphere. The government told people that it involved gathering weather data. It used a very unusual type of pulse modulation. In most cases they used a CW (continuous wave) oscillator and pulsed the signal. This turned out to be a very efficient conversion of electrical energy to etheric energy. I very recently started collecting radiosondes. I never saw a receiver. I found out that they were designed up at Brookhaven National Labs. I started to talk to people at Brookhaven and ran into a retired gentleman who used to work there. He told me that the design was originally done by Wilhelm Reich. That peaked my interest. The story goes that in about 1947 Wilhelm Reich handed the US Government a wea ther' control device, a device that would do OOR-busting. Reich thought that if he could decrease the amount of DOR that storms would not be so violent. (OUR is the result of orgone energy coming into contact wi th an enclosed radioactive source. This produces a Deadly Orgone Energy - DOR - which threatens life. It is also produced in the a tmosphere through other processes. The government sent the device up there into a storm and it did reduce the intensity of the storm. The government liked it, and they started another phase of the Phoenix project where they designed these \"radiosondes\" and started launching them"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 in large numbers, maybe 200 to 500 per day. The radio in these things had a range of about 100 miles. If they used so many of them, one would think that receivers for them would be common- place. I used to be a collector of radio receivers. I have over 100 in my personal collection. I have never seen a radiosonde receiver. I have heard of them but I have never seen them. What are the frequencies used? The frequencies used are 403 MHz and 1680 MHz. They used two different frequencies. They are both on at the same time? No. One or the other was used at any one time. The earlier ones used 403 MHz plus or minus 2 MHz. The later ones used 1680 MHz, plus or minus 6 MHz. The \"thermistor\" in them had gold, silver, platinum and iridium in it. Reich used sensors Chat had gold and silver in them. The humidity element is a plastic plate with silver around the rim and conductive lines going across the plate. They put a very unusual mixture of chemicals on this plate. Unlike most humistors, the resistance went up as it got damp. What we're theorizing at this point is that the \"thermistor\" (temperature sensing) rod acts like a OUR antenna out-of-phase. The \"humidity sensor\" acts as an antenna for the orgone; The pressure sensor is essentially what they call a barrel switch. which is a pressure sensitive cycling switch. The device would destroy DOR and build up the orgone. The transmitter consisted of two oscillators, one of which would run at the carrier frequency (403 or 1680) and a second one which was a 7 MHz oscillator hooked into the grid of the carrier oscillator. The result was that the 7 MHz oscillator would pulse on and off. How does all this relate to what was going on with these other projects? The government could not tell the public these were weather control devices. What we are seeing here is actually the genesis of what became the Montauk project, which was a combination of Wil helm Reich 's work and the Philadelphia Experiment - There were two separate projects going on in Phoenix One. You had the invisibility aspect and you had the development of Wilhelm Reich 's wea ther control. Toward the end of the Phoenix project, by using some of Wilhelm Reich's concepts and some of the transmission schemes used from the \"radiosonde\" project , they found that you could combine the two factors and use them for MIND CONTROL. Government circles would have me say \"mood a1 teration': but mind control is what these idiots were doing. 0425"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"MATRIX III That 's what the Montauk project was? No, Phoenix One. After political circles found out about it they wanted it shut down. The people that were running it went to the military and proposed that they could use i t to \"influence the minds of the enemy\". The military loved the idea, and let them use the old Montauk Air Force Base. Among the equipment requested was an old SAGE radar unit, which was on the base. The base was shu,t down and everything was auctioned off. The group then moved in from the Brookhaven Labs. That began what we call Phoenix Two. They spent the first ten years, from about 1969 to about 1979, researching pure mind control. They started out by taking the output of the SAGE radar, modulating the special wave that Reich had showed them from the wea ther control process, and combined that with something noticed from the Philadelphia Experiment work. They transmitted about 406 MHz. It would hop around frequencies and change in phase. They used the amp1 idine concept where you have many stages pulse-modula ted. BRF was from 10 cycles to 750 cycles. The pulse width could be varied anywhere from 10 to 75ms- The center frequency was 406MHz generated from a stay-low type function which was referenced from a zero- time function. Was there any other modulation on this? There was frequency hopping on- i t . So Phoenix Two started in 1969? Yes, in the period from 1969 to 1971. Phoenix One went from 1948 to 1968. The first part of the mind control project was to take an individual and stand them about 250 feet away from the antenna. The SAGE radar had a peak pulse power of .5 MW. The antenna had a gain of 30db. That means an effective radiated power of at least a gigawatt. It was nominally a gigawatt. Can you imagine what that would do to people? I think its amazing these people are still here. It does things like burn out brain functions, create neurological damage, scar lungs from heat, etc. They tried this with a number of people and there were few survivors. Where did they get the volunteers for this? They were just grabbing indigent people off the street and throwing them in front of the radar beam. That's the sort of nonsense that the government loves to do. Who was in charge of the project at this time? Dr. John Von Neumann and Jack Pruett,"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Any particular agency? I 'm not sure what the agency was. Now, somebody got the brilliant idea to put the subjects directly in line with the gain horn of the antenna. Lo and behold they got their result without burning the people up. They found out that by varying the phase modulation and the frequency hopping and the pulsing of the multiple phases that they could have profound effects on a persons mind. How many people worked at this installation? Abou t 30. Who authorized them use of the base? The Air Force and the Navy. It was a joint project. There were both Navy and Air Force personnel involved. We have copies of the orders for the Air Force personnel. What was the cover story for the base? They had none. It was a derelict base. It was abandoned. It was turned over to GSA as surplus around 1969 or 1970 when they shut down all the SAGE radar systems. It was a \"non-existent\" operation. It was a perfect cover. Where did they get the funding? It was totally private. Corporations? It didn't originally come from corporations, although it did in later phases. The original money came from the Nazi government. This is Phoenix One? No, this is Phoenix Two and Three. In 1944 there was an hmerican troop train that went through a French railroad tunnel carrying $10 billion in Nazi gold which they had found. It was $10 billion at the 1944 price of $20 per ounce. The train was blown up in the tunnel. It killed 51 American soldiers, The gold turned up ten years later at Montauk. This has been verified. That money was used to finance the project for many years as the value of gold went up. They spent all of it and ran o?- t of money. That's when they tapped on ITT,' who funded it.

In terms of personnel, many of the civilians and scientists there were"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 all ex-Nazi's who came from Germany both before and after the war ended. The project was under US Government surveillance. The intelligence community knew what was going on and the CIh moni tored everything, as did other government intelligence agencies. The field of players who actually operated on the base was small, between 30 and 50. The funding was entirely private. After 1983, Senator Goldwater found out about it and started an investigation. He couldn't find any trace of government funding. Pruet t was the metaphysical director of the project. He was Air Force. After he left Dr. Herman C. Untermann took over. They had an electronics expert, Dr. Mathew E. Zerrett, who came over from Germany in 1946 with Werhner Von Braun. Probably the reason that they ran out of money is that they had a total of 25 bases around the United States to support, The last of the bases shut down August 12, 1983. The base at Montauk, where all the stations got their zero-time reference from, shut down and the other two remaining bases went down with i t. What about some of the mind effects? From what I recall of the program, as I was part of it, I was subjected to the mind control field not as I initially went into the program (because they wanted me initially for my sensitive abilities) but later. I was assigned to the indoctrination of the younger recruits. The first indoctrination turned out to be a disaster. I told them I didn't want anything to do with the program, and they put me in front of this mind beam, and it did do damage to me. Finally, someone said, \"shut it off, he isn't going to give in .to it\" and they shut it off. Others were affected much more seriously than I was. The effects were generally really bad. It could burn your brains out. They would go out and pick kids between the ages of 12 and 16 off the street... That's where a lot of disappearing American kids went? We estimate they took 10,000 American children off the street and brought them to Montauk, New Jersey. The total number of people that they pulled off the streets for the 25 stations was about 250,000. What the actual thrust of the program was in terms of all these kids is still a mystery. We still don't know the answers. We know they were fully programmed for something. They were subjected to programming which eventually became more \"humane\" using advanced electronic techniques. The original programming was Reichian in nature and was more physical. Later they worked out techniques that used computers and electronic programming with the Reichian techniques that took very fast and had little side effects. Are you aware of any people presently who have been through this?"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 I've run into people over the years. There is a very specific field identity pattern you can detect if you are sensitive enough. You can spot a person who has been through the Montauk program \"five miles away\". It's vary distinctive in the way that it's been a1 tered. I've spotted more than a dozen people in the Long Island, New York area. What about Von Neumann? He was still alive up until 1989. He has run into a problem with the government as well as other problems, such as a personality split in 1977, when he resigned as director and became a consultant. The government told everyone he died in 1956. The government is still interacting with him. Were any of the Montauk subjects given psychotropic drugs? I don't think so,. . They used one drug which was used in connection with the Reich programming to make them more receptive. I don't remember the name of it. The effect of the drug was that it would make you \"horny as he1 1 \". Also euphoric at the same time? A~SD euphoric, yes. Did they get this mind-a1 tering chair from the aliens? The prototype came from the aliens. Beyond that we are uncertain. This chair was essentially a mind amplifier. The government would have specially trained individuals sit in the chair and generate thoughtforms, which would be amplified and transmitted. They could transmit the signal and put people in a pre-orgasmic state where they would be receptive to programming. It worked very well and they found other capabilities. They found that it could work in time. They had a psychically trained individual sit in the chair and generate a thoughtform of a vortex that connected 1947 and 1981. That's exactly what they got - a time tunnel they could walk through. There was a series on television at one time that portrayed this concept fairly accurately. These were some of the earlier capabil i ties. They started going forward and backward in time. That was the last phase of the Phoenix project. When did this time machine get going? Around 1979 or 1980 it was fully operational. This transmitter had enough power to warp space and time. The individual in the chair would have to synthesize the vortex function because they didn't have the technical capability to do that. It can now be mechanically synthesized. They did other things. They"},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 had the subject in the chair think of some creature, and the creature would materialize. They had the individual in the chair think of all the animals at Montauk point charging into town, and that's exactly what happened. They almost had the power to create a being. The problem they had was that what they created only stayed as long as the mind amplifier was on. The power was somewhere be tween gigawatts and terrawa t ts. Tremendous power. The vortex could have a diameter of about five miles. Can you describe what this looked like? Its like looking into a peculiar spiral tunnel which was lit up down its entire length, You would start to walk into this thing and then suddenly you 'd be pulled down it. You didn't walk through it as such. You were more or less propelled through it. You could go anywhere in space and time. Could you bring things back? Yes. Have you ever brought anything back? Yes. Could you continue your description of the tunnel? Yes. The walls were solid but fluted. The tunnel was not straight but was a sort. of corkscrew shape. If someone turned off the power, would you be stuck in the destination time and space? Yes. You'd be stuck there. Did they send a lot of kids down the tunnel? Yes, but we don't know what their goals were. They lost a lot of kids. Since there is a time loop between however far you went back in the past through however far into the future, is everything fixed? Yes. One of the first things they did was send recruits forward to around 6030 AD. It was always to the same point. Somewhere in an abandoned city where there was a statue of solid gold.

Can you change the present by sending someone to the past? Yes. You can also change the present by sending someone into the future. Under certain conditions. The government is using existing time machines to go forward in the Montauk time line. Are you saying that now the present can't be changed because we have established a time-loop through the future and the past? Yes. That means whatever everyone is doing between the most extreme past point and the future they will be doing forever, What is the furthest anyone has traveled in the future? 10,000 AD. So everything is locked in until 10,00OAD? Yes. It's a dreamlike reality. No one has picked up a tangible future beyond 2012 40. There is a very abrupt wall there with nothing on the other side. Prophecies speak of earth changes around then. Curious, isn't it? Can you project yourself two hours into the future and meet you rsel f ? Yes, but its very dangerous.

The vortex could be arranged to follow the person, so that they could bring them back in if anything went wrong. They could see them on a viewer. So they achieved a working time portal. At one point they had"},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"MATRIX III a situation where they had a \"monster from the ID\" type creature come through and everyone went into a panic. They shut the transmitter off, The creature ate people and equipment. They had to go back and shut down the unit in Philadelphia in order to shut off the unit in the future so they could stop this creature in 1983. This was on August 12,1983. The vortex locked on to the 12 August 1943 test and formed a loop. A11 this occurred because someone planted the thought in the mind of the operator in the chair to generate this creature. It was an effort to sabotage the project, A lot of people thought the project had gone too far. When I worked for them between 1971 and 1983 I was so tired when I would get home from work. What they would do is that when I my mission was over they would return me to a point milliseconds before I left. It would appear from one perspective that I never left. Of course, after I stopped working there, all that stopped. Is there a reason that all these things happened? If you go back into the Philadelphia experiment end of it, which was the beginning of the whole business, one can see from the way that thing was maneuvered that there was a higher force of some kind involved in setting the whole thing up. . . . because i t never would have happened the way i t did unless two obscure dates 40 years apart coincided between the two experiments: the project known as the Philadelphia experiment , or Project Rainbow, in 1943 and the Montauk project in 1983. If I may interject something here. There is a point about two thirds of the way down the time tunnel where the person who is going through the tunnel perceives a large \"thump\". .The person 's consciousness leaves thei r body. There is a tendency to see things on a broader basis. I am sure there was some intelligence there. Looking back on my experiences, I 'm sure there was some intelligence there. I would have trouble with the recognition of it. What they were trying to do at Montauk was to stabilize the perception process that would occur upon exteriorization from the body. They were trying to manifest that for some reason. We don't know what their purpose was. What was the role of the aliens in this whole thing, other than the prototype of the mental amplifier chair? That would be the another part of this that we haven't got into yet- ~et's look at what the Philadelphia experiment got into in a technical sense. It was what started all this happening. It originally began back in the 1930's in Chicago with three people. Or John Hutchinson Sr., who was the Dean of the Universi ty of Chicago, Nickola Tesla, and Or- Kurtenaur, who"},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 was an Austrian physicist who was on staff at the University. They decided to do something with the speculation regarding the concept of things and people being invisible. This subject had been discussed for several year. They got together and did some research at the University of Chicago around 1931 or 1932. In 1933 the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton was formed and the project was transferred there in 1934. One of the people on staff at the Institute was Dr.John Erich Von Neumann, who was from Budapest Hungary. He got his degree in chemistry in 1925 and his PhD in mathematics in 1926. He taught in Europe for about four years and transferred to the United States. He taught at the graduate level for three years and was invited to join the Institute. Other people at the Institute included Albert Einstein, who left Germany in 1930. He went to the California Institute of Technology for three years and taught there and then went to the Institute upon their invitation and acceptance. A lot of other people showed up there as time went on. The project expanded about 1936. In the meantime, Tesla was named director of the project. He was a friend of president Franklin Roosevel t, whom Tesla met in 191 7 when FOR was secretary of the Navy. Tesla was asked at that time to do some work for the government for the war effort, which he did. He accepted and became director of the invisibility project until he resigned in 1942. In 1936, after intensive study, they decided to have an initial test of their work. They achieved some partial invisibil i ty. The Navy and everyone else was encouraged to continue the work, and the Navy supplied money for research. '~cientis ts were coming to the Uni ted States from Germany until 1939, when the war with Germany was started. In 1940, after research using Tesla 's approach, they decided they were ready for a full test at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. They had a small ship and a tender ship at each side. One ship provided the power and the other supplied the drive for the coils. They were tendered to the test ship by cables. The idea was that if anything went wrong they could cut the cables or sink the test ship. Everything worked and the project was declared a success. The important point about the 1940 test is that there was no one on board the test vehicle. It was strictly a dry run with no people. This is important because of what happened later. Other people came on board. Thomas T. Brown joined the project because of his expertise in electrogravity effects. He had the task of solving the problem of the German magnetic mines that were affecting allied shipping and Naval efforts. This led into a parallel project which involved the use of degaussing coils and cables to explode the mines at a distance from the"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"MATRIX III ship. The Navy wanted several people to keep an eye on the tests. That is how I got involved. Keeping technical commentaries. Let's look at Nickola Tesla. In 1879 his father died and his first year at college ended. He came to the United States in 1884. He had enormously intuitive insight. He had a perfect track record. Before coming to the US he had known Robert Oppenheimer, who later worked with the development of the atomic bomb, and Or. David Hilbert, the mathematician who devised equations for Hilbert Space, which described mu1 tiple space or mu1 tiple reali ties mathematically. These equations for multiple space became very important in the project. Dr. Von Neumann met Hilbert in 1927 and retained a lot of what he had learned. With that, Von Neumann developed other new systems of mathematics. Von Neumann was considered to be one of the most outstanding mathematicians in this century. Some think he was better than Einstein. Another ma thema tician involved was Dr. John Levinson, who was born in 1912. He died in 1976. He published three books on mathematics. There is no other history of Levinson himself anywhere that I can find. Levinson developed the so-called Levinson Time Equations. With all this behind them, the group had all they needed to proceed with the project . Af ter the successful 1940 test, the Navy decided to give the project unlimited funds and to classify the project. On December 5, 1941 I was in San Francisco and the government came and told me that a war with Japan would start within 72 hours and that they needed me to assist them. In January 1942 I ended up at the Institute of Advanced .Studies. Tesla was given a ship and a crew for a full sized test. Tesla got a battleship. Tesla and Von Neumann didn't agree on some things. Tesla insisted that they were going to have a very severe problem with personnel. Tesla wanted more time but the Navy wouldn't agree. Tesla made periodic announcements in the late 1930's and early 1940's about his contact with off planet species. He was in contact with the outside, who agreed that there was a problem with the people. He decided to sabotage the 1942 test in an attempt to stop the project. He de-tuned the equipment so nothing would work, The test failed. Tesla then turned the project over to Von Neumann in March 1942 and left the project. Von Neumann went to the Navy and requested time to study the problem to determine what had gone wrong, Von Neumann decided to make changes in some of the equipment. He decided he would need a special ship that was designed from the ground up. The Eldridge was selected. The equipment was built into the ship, They put all the equipment on the ship. October 1942 arrived. They selected 33 volunteers for the crew, who arrived after graduation in December 1942. We still have a picture of the"},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"NC)TRIX III class. After the ship was out of drydock work began. In May of 1943 Von Neumann installed a third generator. It would never synchronize with the other two. It went out of control one day and zapped one of the men. Von Neumann pulled out the third genera tor (instal 1 ed because Tesl a had convinced Von Neumann of the potential problem with people) and went back to the original design. In mid June, the ship had sea trials. On July 22, 1943, they had the test. The ship between radar and optically invisible. They discovered people very disoriented. The Navy pulled the crew off and, consul ted.. Von Neumann, who requested more time. again from the Navy. The Navy, after consul ta tion wi th higher-ups, announced that the drop dead date was on the 12th of August, 1943. Von Neumann voiced his concern that it wasn't enough time. The Navy decided that it just wanted radar invisibility and not optical invisibility. The equipment was again modified by Von Neumann. August 12th arrived. We knew things were not right. The test began, and for about a minute everything was all right. The ships outline could be seen in the water. There was suddenly a blue flash and the ship disappeared entirely. No radio communication was possible. It was gone. In about three hours it came back. One of the masts was broken. Some personnel were partially embedded in the steel deck. Others were fading in and out. Some disappeared entirely. Many were insane. The Navy extracted the crew and proceeded with four days of meetings to decided what to do about the problem, They decided there would be one more test with another dry run without personnel. They conducted the dry run using about 1000 feet of cable attached to another ship. In late October 1943 the test occurred. The ship disappeared for about 20 minutes. When it returned, they found equipment missing. Two transmitter cabinets and one generator was missing. The cabinet with the zero-time reference generator was intact. At that point, the Navy stripped the ship and stopped the project. The Edridge served in the war and was turned over to Greece at the end of the war- The important thing is that there were two tests that were exactly 40 years apart to the day. It was a 40 year separation in hyperspace. Now, the Earth itself has a biorhythm that peaks on a 20 year cycle on dugust 12th. It \"just happened\" to peak and provided the connecting link through the fields of the Earth for the two experiments to lock up in hyperspace. Walk-in efforts are aided if they occur during this peak. The ship was pulled into hyperspace. We were inside the ship and knew something was drastically wrong with the test. We tril-d to shut'it off but it wouldn't shut off. We ran out on deck and jumped over the side of the ship. We jumped overboard but ended up in a time tunnel which ended at"},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"MATRIX III Montauk, Long Island on August 12th, 1983. At night. We were found very quickly and taken down stairs, where Von Neumann greeted us. He expected us. It was a bit of a shock. We had just been in 1943 and now we were in 1983 looking at Von Neumann as an old man. He said that there was a hyperspace lockup and that we had to go back and shut off the generators on the ship or the hyperspace rift would keep increasing and possibly engulf the planet. He had been waiting 40 years for us to arrive. Montauk sent us back and we smashed the equipment with axes. The ship returned to its original point in space and about three hours later in time. From 1943 on, Von Neumann didn ' t know what happened. He had modified earlier equipment in 1943 to where he had a full blown time machine. The Germans also were working on time travel, and had it working in 1945 just before the end of the war. This is all a matter of record. 4fter the Navy decided to shut down the project in 1943, Von Neumann was sent to work on the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos until that was over. In 1947 there were major changes in the Department of Defense. Someone in the new structure decided to dig up the Philadelphia project to see if they could find out what went wrong. They asked Von Neumann to \"take another look\" at the project. He agreed. There is another matter. Starting about August 6th, 1943, UFOs appeared over the Eldridge for about six days. They were there during the test. One of the UFOs was sucked up into hyperspace with the Eldridge and it ended up in an underground facility in Montauk in 1983. Xt contained a charging device which some aliens made us go back and get for them, as they didn't want humans to have it. We don't know who they were. Pruett was concerned about an alien invasion. Also, Von Neumann was called by the government to come and assist in the examination of a crashed UFO in 1947 at Aztec. Another crash 'occurred at Aztec about a year later. The first crash had greys on it and none survived. At least one occupant survived the second crash. The radar systems unintentionally brought down the craft. Radar was used intentionally after that until the aliens got wise to it. The occupant of the second crash was not a grey, and Von Neumann got to talk with it. Von Neumann asked it what the answer to the invisibility problems could be. He learned that he had to go back and do his homework in metaphysics. The nature of the problem was that the personnel on the ship were not locked to the zero- time reference of the ship. Humans are normally locked to the point of conception as a time reference, not a zero-time . reference. The time stream lock allows the person to flow in synch with the system so interaction is possible."},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Time locks are fragile. A11 the power of the project disrupted the time-locks of the people on the deck on the ship. When the ship came back in time, the people didn't come back to the same reference. Von Neumann realized that he needed a computer, as we1 1 as some knowledge of metaphysics in order to be able to lock the time reference of the people to the time reference of the ship. He built a computer in 1950 for the purpose. It was ready to be installed in 1952 and a test was performed in 1953 that was successful. They didn't go floating off into space when it was over. C)t this point, the Navy canceled Project Rainbow and changed the name to project Phoenix. C) lot came out of the negative effects of the Rainbow project. Some of it led to mind control research programs in the Phoenix project . The invisibil i ty research produced some Stealth technology as well as other highly classified projects. In 1983, they decided to apply mind control to all participants in these projects in an effort to cover them up. They had also been working on another project: age regression. Now, Tesla had sought back in the 1940's to develop equipment that could help the members of the crew after they lost time-lock . The government developed it into the age regression program. It was physical age regression. A person retained the memory they had from the older age. Tesla's theory was that if you took the individual's time-lock and moved it forward in time than you would remove aging. That's what happened. It took between 30 and 60 days ' for the body to complete the change to the new time reference. Now, some of this turned up in the movie called the Philadelphia Experiment, which was released in 1984. The government got an injunction which banned showing in the US for two years. It was overturned in 1986 and it was out on tape. I saw the film in 1988, and it helped bring back some of my memory about this. Do you have any initial comments about electromagnetics? Well, there are a lot of interesting aspects. There is a lot that is not explained by most theories. It is not explained why a magnetic field only propagates at 0.4 of the speed of light, electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light and an electric field (according to Maxwells equations) propagates at the rate of c-infinity, which means that it propagates throughout the universe instantaneously. If you understand those basic relationships and how they"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 interlock with higher order energies and fields, like soliton and tensor fields, then you can understand how an antigravity drive will work. It is a fact that the unified field theory was completed by Einstein and given to the US Government. They have it and they donst want anybody to know they have it. It was never released publicly in any books. This kind of know- ledge is used as a method of control between and for govern- ments. It's unfortunate. The government is supposed to be \"for the people and by the people\". That is what it says in the Constitution. I wonder when the last time the president read the Constitution? It seems like there are more people involved in secrecy than there are scientists. Where are all these people? There are government agents and agencies everywhere that are concerned with keeping things secret. These days, the secrecy is applied more to the applications of hardware than the hardware itself. It's not like it was in the 19509s. As an example, the guidance package for the new Minuteman X missle that was developed for the Air Force by Northrop is un- classified. There was no classification on the circuitry and the layout. It was so accurate that it could take a missle 5,000 miles and drop it down a chimney stack. The applications and what it was capable of was classified. Isn't a lot of this left out in the open to distract people from what is really going on? Of course . What is the capacity of the gravity craft fleet of the Uni ted States? I don't know. I know that they have built quite a number of them. What are the capabilities of these craft? Well, when our astronauts first landed on the moon in 1969 they were greeted by a fleet of disks sitting on the rim of a crater. The astronauts asked their superiors if they knew about these disks. They were told \"yes\", that they were American disks. The astronauts were angry at being used as public relations men by the government. Why spend so much money on the Stealth bomber when they have had this gravity technology for so many years? Well, the aircraft combines two aspects for invisibility. One of the aspects relates to the construction and coating applied to the surface. The other aspect relates to an"},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"MATRIX III electronic type of invisibility package which is a result of work done on the Philadelphia experiment years ago. Also, the Stealth has a secondary drive system which is very advanced and allows it to fly in space. The assistant director of NASA admitted that this came straight out of alien technology. He admitted this to the public. He did? Yes. That's interesting in view of the government's apparent position with respect to covert technology. There are breaks in the government secrecy .programs that are starting to show up. More and more people are getting totally disgusted with government activities and attitudes and they are beginning to talk. Maybe it's a deliberate leak. It could be deliberate. Even MJ-12 in 1984 was about to break some information to the public about ET's and UFOs. They decided not to release it at that time. John Kennedy demanded that they release it within one year. He also demanded that the CIA get out of the drug business. They assassinated him. Have you found any resistance to what you have been coming out with? No. The Navy keeps quiet, but I hear rumblings underground that they are definitely not pleased about it. The so-called \"martyrdom clause\" works in my favor. They know that I know why they can't touch me. If they do, they know that there will be real problems in time and space because of it. There are two of us that are holding certain factors in stability. If anything is done to either of us, there could be a rip in hyperspace. The whole reality system will shift. I will give you one guess as to what it will most likely shift to: We won the second world war by a slim margin. German technology was way ahead of us. If the war had gone on another 30 days the Germans would have won it. They had super weapons in pro- duction which they were ready to use. They were so close to winning the war that Churchill and FDR were really worried about it. If the system shifts, it could shift to a parallel reality where the Germans won the war. That's why the government doesn't dare kill either of you? Right. Because of what we were involved in, it might jeopardize our enti re reali ty system. Could you explain how a closed time loop works? 0439"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"Well, one of the problems that has developed is that when you travel through time you cannot come back to the exact point of origin. It has to be later than when you left. If you were to come back to the exact point at which you took off you would be at the same point twice in your lifetime and there would be a very serious problem. Would you refresh my memory about some of the dates involved with the development of electronic mind control in the US? The mind control experiments were moved to Montauk about 1969. The hardware phase of some of the later experiments began about 1975; equipment to modify the SAGE transmitter was ordered about 1973. ITT was the main contractor and sub-contracted portions of the contract out. Most of the contracts were awarded to firms on Long Island. So what did they actually prove that they could do when the experiments were over? What they essentially proved they could do was that they could control a person that they had the \"signature\" for. This pattern that was unique to an individual could be put into the computer program for the transmitter, C) second order wave- length would be transmitted that has a lower attenuation and affects that persons mind directly. There could be a command to do anything focused at the person. Once a device was constructed that illustrated this principle on a wide scale. A mental message was put out that if anybody heard the messsage they were to call a certain phone number. Over 600 calls came from all over the East coast all the way down to Florid. It works. That's interesting. There's a fellow who calls himself Lord Mattreya who says that he is the Christ returned to the planet; that when he links up with the international press he will send a telepathic message to the entire planet in their own language and they will hear it. They also are supposed to receive a visual image. So.. they have that technology? Yes. There is not only an indivdual signature. There's a racial signature and also a universal signal for the human race. The government has used all three to target specific individuals. They have also done group messages targeted on a specific racial or ethnic group. That's common. In Boston and New York they weie doing experiments on \"mood control\" on the cities. Transmitters used no longer exist, but the technology does - 0440"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Do targeted individuals perceive wha t they are receiving as their own thought? Yes. Is there any defense against that? Yes and no. Theoretically no. This is what the government depends on. Practically speaking, they can ' t get everyone, because some people are naturally resistant , depending on their level of mental and psychic development. Perhaps 5% of the population do not respond to these signals. If they get 95% coverage, they don't care about that 5%. That's what they have the riot squads and the concentration camps for. There is no defense unless you can interfere with that signal. Some people just don't react. So they transmi.t a thought signal? Not exactly. If you were put on an EEG, you would exhibit a certain pattern of electrical responses. These can be recorded and they are unique to you. It can be recorded and stored and replicated on a computer. If they can replicate your RNA/DNA pattern they've got you too - for life. You mentioned about concentration camps? Yes. They are all over the United States. There are three in Arizona alone. So they can control us to the point where we'll just hand over our guns? That's what they hope. It depends on how effective this equipment becomes, how thoroughly installed it is everywhere, and whether or not people can ferret this stuff out and render it inoperative before that time arrives. How about the idea of a conflict between moral conscience and what the mental command tells you do to? You don't have the option not to act as it says the way that equipment is set up - if you are not aware enough to make a connection that it is not your thought. It does not negate choice, it just puts in a strong impluse or command. Those people who responded by calling that number had no idea what went through their heads.

You 're suggesting a state of absoul te corruption. absolutely correct. Planned corruption. With this kind of technology, why do they need cohcentra tion camps?

You don't go down the streets shooting everybody dom. Once you're in the camps, they break you down mentally. They're experts at that. We think theyPre shipping guillotines in there for the people that don't comply. They're looking for a slave labor force. That is what H.R. 4079 is about that's in Congress now. It creates a slave labor force in the prison system, which will be privately owned. States will pay the private prison a fee in order to put their prisoner in there. Yes. What are some of the other projects that relate to the capaci ty of factions operating wi thin the Uni ted States Government and corporations to manipulate and control the population? Well, between 1977 and 1978 a project called Dreamscan came on line- It ceased in 1979. The goal of the project was to gain the technical ability to enter into an individuals mind in the dream state and cause his death. There was a movie called Dreamscape which showed what they discovered they could do. The project was run by the Secret Government and managed by the NSA. The purpose of the project was to provide for a means of covert assassination. President Carter found out about it and had it stopped. The hardware is still intact and in storage. There have been attempts to put it back on 1 ine by various intelligence operations, some of which are said to involve AT & T operatives. Wha t else? Around 1987, a project called Moonscan started. It lasted into 1989 and involved positioning mind control equipment on the moon for use on the population of earth. It, like the others, has clear connections to negative alien activi ty. Who ran that one? 0442"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"MATRIX III It was managed by an organization called Airborne Instrument Laboratories (AIL), who have had other covert projects under their wing. At the time, AIL was run by Eaton Corporation. It is now managed by the Department of Defense as of 1988. There are three branches of AIL: Covert, Commercial, and Defense. Any other mind control programs that you can mention? There was a project called Mindwreaker that would allow paralysis of the mind. The aliens were heavily involved with that project . It produced several neurological weapons, some of which are used on the 8-1 bombre, which also contains a lot of alien technology. At time, various alien species came and went out of AIL. There was one group called the K-Group, which was short for the Kondrashkin. They had pale skin that had a slight greenish tint and almost no hair. They looked human, and had to bleach their skin and wear wigs. They have been periodically involved with covert projects since the 1940's. Where has AIL been located? In New York Stare, at Farmingdale, Deer Park and Long Island. What is the current status of AIL? Well, there were eight projects ongoing at AIL that also had to do with the development of weaponry against aliens. In 1989 the Orion group discovered this and destroyed the projects. It can only be assumed that AIL still functions in other areas. What other research goes on at Long Island? Research on scalar weaponry, like the one that destroyed the Challenger. I thought the Challenger was destroyed by the Soviets using scalar weapons? No. The Soviets didn't do that. The oddity with the incidents as far as the Soviets were concerned was that they pulled their ships about 150 miles out to sea before it happened. They were not the direct cause, which was a scalar weapon that they were trying to put into orbit and test. It accumulated a charge while the Challenger was going up-through the atmosphere and turned itself on. That is what destroyed the Challenger. It might have been deliberate.

The expectation was that they could use mind control to take over the populace in the 1990's - no later than 1994 or 1995, They have also been doing genetic work in which they alter a human sperm and ovum to the extent that all offspring will produce hybrids wi th new characteristics. Humans will mate and create children with alien genetics. That's one step beyond the average abduction scenario. .There are other things happening with the human race. Like what? Since 1947, there have been components of the 6th race incarnating on the planet. The 5th race was the Aryans. The 6th race humans are 100% telepathic - the secret government and the Orion group sees them as a threat. They've been aware of it since 1942. Wasn't there a movie about something like that years ago? Yes. I don't remember the name, but it came out in 1982. In that film, there was a drug that made babies that were 100% telepathic. This kind of thing has actually happened. There was a Canadian company that was producing a drug which turned out to do just that. This was between 1946 and 1947. It was removed from the market immediately, although its use continues privately. In the movie, the government had a way of using elect.romagnetics to explode a persons head to get rid of them. Sounds 1 ike something they mught have developed at Montauk. It does, doesn't it? What is the current situation with aliens? Somewhat mixed and confused. There has been a lot going on all around the planet. In September and October 1990 there was an alien group from some other dimension that was attempting to invade the planet. They took down all the zero-time generators all over the country. The FAA was especially affected. The rogue group was stopped by another species. For many years, some factions of the Orion group depended on a ring of alien satellites that would sustain life functions. Those were wiped out in November 1990 by the same group.

Do you think that this group is related to those who flew over military nuclear silos and rendered the warheads inopera ti ve? I don't know if they were involved, a1 though I could ask. The nuclear charade is another thing on a cultural level. The idea of nuclear war was eliminated a long long time ago by all major powers on Earth- The threat of a nuclear winter and the fact that you can't detonate two nuclear devices too close together in time stops them from doing it. I think a lot of people are aware that the same forces that control the United States today are the same forces that supported the buildup of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and arranged for WWII and Vietnam. The public has been lied to in so many areas since the early 1930's that they don't know what's going on. Most people still think that the Congress and the President run the country and that they have Consti tutional rights. How about some interesting technology spin-offs from the Philadelphia experiment? Well, there are a lot of them in use by the CIA and the NSA, as well as other corporate and government agencies. There is a portable unit that can render an individual invisible. The USA is known to use those on a fairly regular basis. There is also a UFO research based covert organization that is be1 ieved to have them? . And what would that be? Well, its a super secret international organization that is funded by all major governments. It performs research on a1 iens and a1 ien technology, coverup operations, and also does espionage. The group is negatively oriented and is considered to have no positive attributes in relation to other humans. It's called the International Aerospace 411 iance. How does it fit into the hierarchy of command and control? It's connected to MJ-12, which is believed to be headed by Kissenger at this time. It is also connected to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President. AIL type units are also connected to the MJ group.

They represent an organically enhanced synaptid processor powered by a micro-positron flow that controls or mimics the functions within the human nervous system with micro relays that duplicate brain operation or engram pat terns. What is the real story behind Wilhelm Reich? Most people are familiar with Reichs brilliant work with bions, weather modification, cancer biopathy and other devices. Reichs work has been of interest to the National Security Agency for some time, and it involves the fact that when a person is electronically maintained in a pre-orgastic state in their nervous system, gateways unto the mind open up for mind control to take hold. It is his most secret work as far as applications are involved. Reichs contact with alien species, his discoveries about 1 ife energy and cancer, and the mind control applications are some of the reasons why he was killed. This knowledge was combined with other knowledge, some of it alien in nature, and integrated into the work at Montauk and subsequent covert projects to subvert the people of the United States and the world under an Orion based system. What are some of the ways they put people into this state? Well, there are these devices. Every psychiatric facility has them. For a male, they attach electrodes to five points on the body (you can guess what one of those points are) and turn the device on. It makes programming an individual really easy.

What about the Philadelphia Experiment as related to aliens? The Philadelphia Experiment was not an alien operation, as such, but what was the set-up was the date, August 12, 1943, because it had to be locked to the Phoenix project on August 12, 1983. The date was set by alien influence in order to cause a 40-year hole in hyperspace through which large numbers of alien craft could enter this dimension. It worked, but it didn't last long enough to give the aliens the maximum benefit of the scenario.

The recipient then thinks of the sender without realizing that the thought was implanted in his mind. It is commonly known as telepathic communication or extrasensory perception (ESP). Everyone possesses the talent but. like other human attributes, the extent of one's ability varies from individual to individual. It seems strongest between family members or loved ones but, like physical skills. the power of telepathy can be exercised or cultivated to the limits of one's aptitude. The SS conducted many experiments in telepathic communications intended to transmit messages to people as they slept. If the dream message was strong enough, the recipient might subconsciously believe it to be his own thoughts and, once awakened, act accordingly. It is not known how far such experiments progressed in Nazi Germany but it'is known how far the science has progressed since World War 11. Following the war. a new technique, called Kirlian photography, captured the aura on film and, for the first time, scientifically proved its existence. Using the technique. an entire human body was photographed and, in the subsequent study of the picture. an amazing discovery was made. The aura emitted from the body at certain focal points that exactly coincided with ancient Chinese acupuncture charts. Despite present day claims that the effectiveness of acupuncture treatments is not understood, this discovery proved what holistic experts had predicted. Disease is often caused by a blockage of the life-giving force of the aura and acupuncture needles merely unblock energy paths to permit the aura to flow unrestricted to the affected area. It is the aura and not the needle that cures the acupuncture - patient. With this new insight into an ancient science, German researchers experimented with one particular acupuncture treatment that for over 5.000 years was believed to enhance one's psychic powers. Finally, they had arrived at a simple, universally effective method to turn average people into masters of telepathic communication by unblocking the focal points of their auras associated with ESP. In the 1950's. several experiments were conducted with a telepathic sender and a receiver located a thousand miles apart. The only aspect new to the experiments was the inclusion of highly sensitive monitoring devices that recorded the minute energy flares on an electronic gauge as it left the sender and"},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 arrived at the receiver. The experiment only confirmed previous findings but one unheralded genius came up with a brilliant idea. The experiment was repeated but, instead of having the sender concentrate on a human receiver, he attempted to send his telepathic message directly to the monitoring equipment. The scientists were amazed when. at the appointed time, a thousand miles from the sender, the needle on the monitoring equipment moved. The machine could not understand the message, only that a message had been received, so the experiment was repeated but this time, instead of sending a speech or thought pattern, the sender projected a series of energy pulses in Morse code. The gauge registered the dots and dashes of the message and easily translated them into the written word. It was a monumental discovery; the first mind/machine link. By 1965, this unpublished science had so advanced as to be applied as the communication system for an ultra-secret intelligence group in the United States. One of the world's largest computers (the same Hewlett-Packard model as used by the General Services Administration to run the Federal government) was set-up and programmed to receive the telepathically communicated reports of thousands of intelligence agents in the field. It is the quickest, most efficient, untappable communication system in the world today; linking the life experiences of thousands of covert operatives directly into the computer data banks that, at a moment's notice, can regurgitate the sum total of their knowledge on anything or anyone so requested. The organization exists today with headquarters in California's Silicon Valley and branches throughout the world that operate in conjunction with acupuncture clinics as conditioning centers for the operatives. It was one of the best kept secrets. The science of telepathic communication has not escaped the interest of the Central Intelligence Agency, which recently funded several studies in parapsychology in a joint venture with the National Security Agency in an effort to establish a super- secret national defense system utilizing the \"energy influences\" of thousands of operatives to jam tbe directional guidance systems of incoming enemy missiles. It a plausible defense. Likewise. CIA reports indicate that as early as 1972, the characteristically austere Soviet Union had allocated an annual budget of over S20 million for their research in this field. Regardless of whether the reader views this account as futuristic fiction or the secret of life. to Heinrich Himmler the science was very serious business. 0545"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 He fkly believed that he had discovered a primeval truth previously mastered only by such historic figures as Jesus Christ. Christ never claimed to be God, not even to save his own life. Had he done so, Pontius Pilate would have dismissed him as insane and exempted him from execution. Christ professed to be the \"Son of God\" but within the limited scope of our understanding we have failed to see that we are all \"sons of God\" and the only difference between Christ and the rest of humanity is that he had mastered the essence of his nature. He knew who he was, from where he came, why he was here and what awaited him after death, whereas most people have absolutely no concrete answers, only mythological hearsay to explain these very basic mysteries of life. Himmler viewed Christ's powers to cure the sick as no more than the ability to impart his extremely strong aura to upgrade the low energy levels of the afflicted. Likewise, his miraculous power to raise the dead was no more than the ability to cure the ailment that had expelled the spirit, then travel through the astral world to retrieve the spirit and guide it back into the body. To Himmler, the \"resurrection\" was just the physical embodiment of the astral body. Hiamler's assessment of the powers of Jesus Christ may well be correct. Several studies have gooe so far as to accuse the Vatican of suppressing psychic research out of fear that science might provide a logical explanation for what they would prefer their following to think of as miracles. Like their spiritual experiments, the Nazis' medical experiments have been grossly underrated. SS scientists, like the notorious doctor-killer, Fritz Fischer, had the free, unrestricted use of human guinea pigs, not just lab animals that only approximated human response. Tremendous strides were made in the areas of genetic engineering and sterilization but the only accomplishment reported was their development of the technique of male sterilization commonly known as a vasectomy operation. Himmler, who had made it illegal for non-Aryans to reproduce, wanted to make it impossible, hence the concentration on techniques of sterilization. Professor Carl Clauberg, director of sterilization at Auschwitz devised an ingenious way to sterilize the sub-humans en masse. Twenty-four specially built counters were installed throughout Germany.and Poland.

Huxley's work certainly did not escape Himmler's attention as he included his name on the \"Special Search List\" of those Englishmen slated for kidnapping by the SS. Though they did probably engage in such research, there is no indication that the SS succeeded in synthesizing life in the laboratory as they continued to stock Germany and Austria with naturally-born Aryan children they acquired through the Lebensborn (Fountain of Life) Program."},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 SS officers. who could prove an ancestry untainted by sub-human blood back to the year 1750, were ordered to stud for the Lebensborn Program. They married only women with the \"correct racial features;\" fair-skinned, blue-eyed, blonde. wide hipped and full breasted. In SS wedding ceremonies they exchanged the following vows, \"We stand. we starve, we do our bitter duty.\" Four sons were expected if the officer's career was to advance. When the program failed to produce the goal of one million male super-babies, polygamy was legalized for the SS. But, even with polygamy, each of the SS officer's wives could be expected to produce only one man-child every two years, in practice it was more like one every three or four years. Himmler realized that time was limited for both the Nazis and Lebensborn Program and that if he was to succeed in reaching his targetted goal of super-babies within the allotted time frame, he would require every Aryan woman in Germany to be pregnant by the SS. He formed The League of German Girls to catalog the racial backgrounds of unwed women and encourage them to have as many illegitimate Aryan children as possible. Himmler launched a major propaganda campaign called, \"Mutter und Kind\" (Mother and Child) in which posters and newsreels heralded the Aryan madonna as the heroine of Germany for ha.ving extended her love for the Fuhrer to his SS and bearing a son with the \"correct racial features.\" The heart of the Lebensborn Program was the network of maternity wards that the SS established throaghout Germany to care for the every need of the expectant mothers and their children. While the majority of Germans suffered from shortages of fresh meat and vegetables during the war years, the Lebensborn children received the best of everything. The program had been given top priority; Himmler's super-babies were considered more important than the German Army. When the Lebensborn Program continued to fall short of Himmler's expectations, he ordered the SS to kidnap Aryan infants from the countries they occupied in Europe and transport them to Lebensborn wards in Germany. Kidnapping foreign-born Aryan children was only logical when one remembers that the Nazis were fighting people and not countries. In 1939, the Waffen SS followed the Geman Army into Poland to catalog the populace.

Farben -- at least for about three months until they succumbed to the meager diet of turnip soup. Though many Poles were executed in the concentration camps, over 200.000 Polish Aryan children were kidnapped and sent to Lebensborn wards where they were given German names and raised as pampered Nazis.

Obviously, the Lebensborn children must have been indoctrinated in the Nazi philosophy but there has been some speculation that Himmler had developed a means to hypnotize or brainwash them to program their future work in the \"Thousand Year Reich.\" Though such a process has been described only in fiction like Huxley's novel. Himmler must have at least tried to maintain control because not doing so would have been as foolish as allowing the uncontrolled procreation of chickens to the point where they overran the farmhouse. Himmler must have had some technique that justified his taking financial responsibility for groups of children like the 200,000 Poles. while the German economy suffered under the burden of war.

Himmler resolved his dilemma with an ingenious system that named each child differently. yet the same.

Perhaps this work rill help to answer such questions. Plain-clothed SS agents, stationed in movie theaters throughout Germany, monitored audience reaction to Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels' newsreels and documentaries. He so advanced the art of politrcal propaganda that the United States. even with all the talent of Hollywood, could not produce an effective counter-campaign. The propaganda unit of the U.S. army chose instead to concede to the Nazis' superior movie-making ability and used Germany's own film footage to frighten the American people with the strength and determination of their enemy. The propaganda war, or the \"reel war\" as it has been called, is a simple example of how the United States was developing a pattern of following the Nazis' lead.

Hitler's strategy to win World War XI was surprisingly simple. He was fighting on zwo major fronts: the Russians to the east and the Americans and British to the west. So very early in the conflict Hitler initiated a plan to infiltrate and misinform his enemies in an effort to create friction, especially 05 50"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 between the United States and Russia. The present day cold war was born out of this plan of Hitler's to divide and conquer. Officers of the SS, posing as the German underground, contacred the Americans through Allen Dulles who then headed the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in Switzerland. The rather elaborate masquerade was intended to convince Dulles that Russia and not Germany was the true enemy of the United States. Likewise. Hitler's top aide, Rudolf Hess staged a spectacular defection to the west to persuade England and America to join forces with Nazi Germany against the Russians. With all the false rhetoric and rumor, it was no surprise that hostility prevailed at the meeting of the Russian and American armies when they converged outside Berlin. The mistrust and misunderstanding increased when Hitler's vast stockpile of gold could not be found. Tons of gold: the German treasury, the treasuries of the countries they had conquered, the confiscated gold of the Holocaust victims, even the jewelry of Helen of Troy was missing from the Berlin museum. The Russians accused General Patton of hoarding the fortune and refusing to share in the spoils of war. Patton accused the Russians of the same but was to die in a suspicious auto accident during his subsequent quest to find the gold and discredit Russian claims. The gold has never been found, giving rise to the theory that it was hidden by the SS and spent covertly to support the fraternity's work after the war. One of the-key figures in the SS's master plan to control the United States was a member of the Great German General Staff, Reinhard Gehlen. General Gehlen. a staunch anti-communist, was one of Hitler's architects of the eastern front invasion and the foremost Nazi intelligence expert on Russia. It has been said that his files on Russia were more extensive than even those kept by the Russians themselves, epitomizing Field Marshall Rommel's quotation. \"The first rule of war is to know everything there is to know about your enemy.\" In April of 1945, four days beiore Hitler reportedly committed suicide in his Berlin bunker, General Gehlen and a small staff defected with the Russian files to the Bavarian Alps where, at a place called Misery Meadows, they buried the catalogues in fifty metal boxes. Though Gehlen could have easily escaped, he nade no attempt to do so. He waited in Misery Meadows for nine days and then traveled down the mountains to surrender. By this time the Americans had come to believe the Nazi propaganda about Russia and were only too happy to welcome Gehlen,"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 his expertise, his files and his network of planted sples in Eastern Europe. Four months later, in August, Gehien was smuggled into Washington, D.Z. disguised as a four star U.S. Army General, befitting his rank in the German Army. He was well-received, being quartered at Fort Hunc. where a butler and several white-coated servants were provided for his comfort. For the next few weeks. Gehlen met wlth Preskdent Truman and General William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, the head of the OSS. Ever since President Roosevelt had sent him on a fact-finding tour of Europe just before the war. Donovan had advocated the establishment of a central intelligence group. Donovan was a New York attorney when Roosevelt first sought his services. World War I1 had elevated him to the rank of General in charge of our somewhat primitive intelligence gathering Office of Strategic Services. It took about a month for Donovan and Gehlen to convince the president to reorganize U.S. intelligence. On ~e~tember 20. 1945, Truman disbanded the OSS and for four months the United States relied only on military intelligence to formulate foreign policy. On January 22. 1946, Truman established the Central Intelligence Group, under an authority headed by Rear Admiral Sidney W. Souers. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as we know it today was born of this group on September 18. 1947, under the direction of Rear Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter who had set up the wartime intelligence network in the Pacific for Admiral Chester Nimitz along with Rear Admiral Edwin T. Layton. The CIA, designed to a large extent by Reinhard Gehlen, was staffed with former OSS. FBI. SS and SD agents. Yes, half were Americans, half were German Nazis. With the full support of the U.S. government, the man, who now called himself \"Dr. Gehlen.\" returned to Germany to establish the West German Federal Intelligence Agency or \"Gehlen's Organization\" as the CIA called its European spy ring. Initially, the CIA gave Gehlen an annual budget of $600,000 but that was soon increased to 520 million. The CIA spent 53 million just to remodel a former SS housing development :or Gshlen's headquarters. Over one thousand agents and thelr famil~es lzved totally within the walled compound that was once the headquarters of Martin Bormann and Rudolf Hess. Gehlen established sixty spy schools that graduated over 7,000 new agents .to join the veteran Nazls in the field. It was Gehlen's idea to start Radio Free Europe; a propagandisiic news station located only a few miles from his headquarters."},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Always pleased with Gehlen's work, the agency showed their appreciation by giving him a $114 million lakeside village in Starnburg, Bavaria to which he retired in 1967 after a series of scandals involving former SS officers in his employ (hence the employ of the CIA) forced his abdication amid a rash of \"suicides\" among his critics. This former Nazi General, who has been called the \"co-founder of the CIA.\" exerted considerable influence in formulating U.S. foreign policy when one considers that three- fourths of all U.S. intelligence on Russia originates in \"Gehlen's Organization.\" Many Americans, especially those who lived through World War 11, may find it difficult to accept the fact that the U.S. governsent would be so foolish as to hire Nazis to organize and staff such a critically important federal agency as the CIA but that is exactly what happened. If Washington was taken in by the Nazis. it occurred not after. but during the war when they began to accept Germany's claims that the Russian communrsts were the real threat. Following the war, fear of the Russians was all that was needed to prompt Truman to accept Gehlen's well-placed spies who provided a convenient solution to concerns that, whether legitimate or not, had been brought to Washington's attention by the Nazis. The SS was so far superior to the Americans in their'espionage techniques that their inclusion in U.S. intelligence required a complete revamping of the system. So many former SS and SD agents were hired by the CIA that they formed the basic personality of the agency. They all swore allegiance to the United States just as they had all sworn allegiance to Adolf Hitler years earlier. If one is still skeptical as to the extent to which the Nazis infiltrated the CIA, the evidence is easy to confirm. Instead of trying to pierce the security of the CIA and look for agents who are former Nazis. simply review the stories of Nazi war criminals and suspects recently discovered living in .America; most. if not all, have a history of working for the CIA. X good example is the 1983 arrest of Klaus Barbie, a notorious SS officer known as \"The Butcher of Lyons1' for his war crimes against the people of that French city. Following the war, Barbie was hired by the CIA and hidden from the French who had targetted him for prosecution. Barbie worked as a CIA informant in Bolivia where,. according to reports, he organized a mercenary force to protect Bolivia's cocaine trade, cocaine that eventually ended up on the streets of the United States.

Though it was nearly forty years too late. the United States apologized to France for having protected Barbre, being one of the few times that the U.S. officially acknowledged that their hiring of Nazls was wrong. Another Nazi who worked for the CIA and one whose history is more pertinent to this story is Otto Albrecht Alfred von Bolschwing. According to a 1981 newspaper article, The war over, von Bolschwing made a move crucial to his future success; He became an American spy. \"He knocked on the door of the U.S. Army Intelligence,\" a source explained,\" and said, 'I'm experienced, I have a ring operating. If you give ne a paycheck, I'll make you very happy.' He was sort of a miniature Reinhard Gehlen. \"1 In March of 1969, von Bolschwing was hired as a consultant by XI, a hlgb-tech investment firm in Sacramento that planned to capitalize on the latest military technology developed in California's Silicon Valley. TCI was engaged in classified work for the Department of Defense and according to the company's founder, \"Ours was going to be a sensitive thing. We all had to have sec~rity clearances.\"2 A TCI memo written in 1969 reported that its new consultant. \"has extremely valuable connections and information in Germany, Switzerland. Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Antilles and South America. Mr. von Bolschwing's connections in these countries are current.\"3 In his first year with TCI, -Jon Bolschwing was appointed president of the firm by its board of directors, one of whom was the oil billionaire, Jobn Paul Cetty, Jr. From 1939 until 1942, the FBI had been investigating Getty's father because of his close personal relationship with Adolf Hitler and his illegal practice Of selling oil to the Xazis via Mexico.

Von Dam was \"too busy\" to talk about von Bolschwing, but through her White House secretary said she knew him \"socially\" in Sacramento \"many years ago.\"4 Soon after von Bolschwing assumed control of TCI, several of the company's major stockholders began syndicating their stock and selling it to small investors in the Sacramento area. The trading was eventually found to be illegal and several stockho1,ders (but not von Bolschving) were prosecuted by the Sacramento District Attorney's Office who referred to the case as \"possibly the biggest stock fraud in California history.\" Gehlen. Barbie and von Bolschwing are presented here as three prime examples of the thbusands of Nazis who infiltrated the CIA and whose post-war activities continued to have detrimental effect on the American people. Von Bolschwing is of particular interest as his business dealings in California blazed a trail that lead directly to Jonestown. One of TCI's two Silicon Valley subsidiaries, a Sunnyvale Corporation called International Imaging Systems (formerly Stanford Technology) purchased Intercontinental Technology, a Washington D.C. based marketing firm to represent them in the sale of sopnisticated electronic surveillance equipment to African and Middle Eastern governments. This was not a new endeavor for International Imaging Systems that, under its former name, had supplied the CIA-backed Shah of Iran. The founder and president of the Intercontinental Technology was none other than the notorious CIA arms dealer, Frank Terpil. The New York Times reported that Terpil and his partner, Edmond - Wilson, used Intercontinental Tecbno- logy's Geneva office for payment of forner Army Special Forces troops. or Green Berets, he had recruited to train terrorists in Libya. according to several participants in the o~eration.5"},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 The purchase of Terpil's company by von Bolschwlng's subsidiary is hard evidence of at least a connection between the two men that went beyond their mutual affiliation with the CIA. It also attests to the wrdely-held belief that the agency operates front companies in the U.S. despite the fact that such activities were a direct violation of their charter. The connection is important, for Terpil later admitted to a BBC interviewer that, during this period of time, he supplied sercenaries and arms to the early stages of Jonestown, when the jungle camp was used as a CIA training center. Von Bolschwing provides the first glimpse into a Nazi/CIA/Jonestown connection: a living bridge between the Crystal Night and the White Night. The Central Intelligence Agency is not responsible for the Jonestown atrocity, but they are accountable for it. Any government agency or, for that matter, any government, is a concept and only as good or as bad as the people it employs. This is particuxarly true of the CIA, which lacks the chaln of command that typically structures most organizations. The CIA is compartmental which enables each department to function independently. Certainly not everyone employed by the agency knows that the CIA sponsored the Jonestown experiment, perhaps not even the agency's director is aware that Jim Jones was an operative. Not even the agency personnel working in Jonestown knew the full scope of the experiment that was conducted by what the CIA will eventually term a renegade faction. Following World War 11, the CIA began its operation from several office buildings scattered throughout the Washington, D.C. area. Though contrary to the agency's name, this decentralized structure was necessary to compartmentalize the various activities of the U.S. and former Nazi German agents. Eventually. Congress granted 46 of the 60 million dollars the agency requested to construct a headquarters building on a isolated government reserve across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. In its initial presentation to the House Appropriations Committee, the agency reported, The new building will consist of block-type wings, readily com- partmented from one another, so that specially restricted areas can be established and special controls maintained in-each sect ion."},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1x1 The Langley, Virginia headquarters houses untold numbers of self-contained departments that operate independently behind unmarked doors. Through one of those doors passed the truth about Jonestown. While presidents come and go (from Washington to Reagan, they average only five years in office) the true power of the executive branch of government is carried from administration to administration by the different.departments of the CIA. The best assessment of the threat the CIA presently poses to the American people comes from the president who helped establish the agency. In 1963, Harry Truman wrote in a syndicated newspaper article. For some time I have been disturbed by the way the CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-maklng arm of the govern- ment...I never had any thought that when I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak-and-dagger opera- tions. dome of the complications and embarrassment that I think we have experienced are in part attributable to the fact that this quiet intelligence arm of the President has been so removed from its intended role that it is interpreted as a synbol of sinister and xysrerious foreign intrigue. Even as early as 1963. Truman and many others recognized that the executive branch of government was no longer in conrrol of the agency but no one questioned who sas in conrrol. Everyone assumed that the CIA had gone its separate ray under its own power. No one could see that the Nazis who helped establish the agency had used the need to know security system to continue the Third Reich in the United States under the impenetrable cloak-of national security. The Nazis hiding in the CIA were relatively quiet for the first few years after World War I1 that it required to convince the American public that their true enemy was not fasciss but communism. The success"},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"M'ATRIX 111 of the ~c~arthy Era propaganda campaign in the early 1950's marked a distinct change in U.S. intelligence. No longer satisfied with merely gathering information about world events, as was their chartered function, the CIA began to create events that shaped history. With the formation of the Natlonal Security Agency in 1952, the CIA was relieved of most of the responsibility for gathering intelligence but-even. though it had outlived its original function, the agency continued to grow in personnel and budget. They were left with little more to do than play \"what if\" games; speculative contingency planning l)ke, \"Is there a pharmaceutical solution to the growing unrest among Blacks and Native Americans?\" The experiment in '- Jonestown was conceived from just such speculation. Jim Jones worked for the CIA but that does not exc+lude the distinct possibility that he only worked through the agency for his true employer, the Nazls. As a youngster he szudied the Sazis, later he would employ Nazis in his Peopies Temple that was structured along fascist lines. When the FBI searched Jones' San Francisco office after the massacre they found that half the books in his personal library were about behavior modification and the other half were about Nazi Germany. The odyssey that ended in Jonestown, began some fifteen years earlier in Brazil when Jones received his life assignment, presumably but not necessarily, from his CIA employer. At precisely the same time that Jones moved to the Belo Horizonte suburb of San Antonio. Brazil, Josef Hengele, the infamous \"Angel of Death\" purchased a fars just south of him. Josef Yengele was born to the wealthiest family in Gunzburg, Bavaria. He was raised a strict Roman Catholic, studied anthropology and eventually went to work for the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. When Xitler declared that only anthropologists were qualified to separate Aryans from sub-humans, Yengele was appointed head of the genetic experiments at Auschwitz. In the death camp, Yengele preferred to experiment on young twins. He would use some new weapons or drug the SS was developing to kill one of the twins and then kill the other by some conventional means. Autopsies were then performed on both corpses for comparison. He also attempted to unlock the genetic secret that produces twins in an effort to double the output of the Lebensborn Program. Mengele was personally responsible for the death of 400,000 inmates at Auschwitz; four times the number killed by the combined nuclear explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Josef Mengele murdered sore people than anyone else in history."},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 After the war, Yengele was interred by the occupying Americans who transported him back to his native Bavaria where they released him under his own name. They knew who he was and let him go free. With characteristical Nazi arrogance, Wengele expected to continue his genetic experiments after the war but, despite obvious support from the Americans, he was not safe in Europe. In 1948, he traveled down the Rat Run to Genoa, Italy where, with the help of the Red Cross and the Vatican, he was issued a passport of the type intended to repatriate victims of the Nazis. Under the name Dr. Helmut Gregor, Mengele boarded a freighter for Buenos Aires, where President Juan Peron had welcomed thousands of Nazis fleeing persecution for their war crimes. The Wengele family had managed to retain the bulk of their fortune through the war and their financial support of Josef enabled him to continue his experiments in Argentina. He bought a pharmaceutical company in Buenos Aires and set to work analyzing the blood samples that he had brought with him from Auschwitz. In 1956. with a passport in his own name, Mengele traveled to Zurich. Switzerland where he visited his family and married his brother's widow. It would appear that he enjoyed a great deal of freedom for being one of the most wanted men in the world but this security was soon shattered when, after his return to South America, Israeli commandos kidnapped Adolf Eichmann in Argentina to stand trial in Israel. In 1959, Yengele fled to Paraguay where fellow Nazis helped him establish a false cover. For the next twenty-five years, most who hunted for Yengele believed he was hiding somewhere in Paraguay when actually he had moved to Nova Europa, Brazil in late 1960. His new wife left him in 1961 as his first wife had years earlier. In 1962, Mengele purchased a farm in Serra Negro, Brazil in partnership with a European couple who shared his fascist politics. At that same time, Jim Jones moved into a rented house in San Antonio, just a short distance north. Yengele was the foremost living authority on the Nazis' genetic experiments and Jim Jones would soon assume his title. The fact that the two men moved so close to each other during a pivotal point in both their lives suggests that they met. Jonestown could have been the \"changing of the guard\"; the Xouveau Xazi superbabies taking power from Himmler's SS. There may not be a Fourth Reich, only a continuation of the Third. It has been said that Jones traveled to Brazil after escaping Jonestown with the medical. records.

'On February 7, 1979, jist ten weeks after the Jonestown massacre. Mengele reportedly drowned in a swimming accident. His death was not revealed until 1985 when, in the midst of.tne greatest manhunt in history, Mengele's Nazi partners in Brazil announced that the Angel of Death was dead and buried. The body was exhumed but, after so many years in the dirt, the remains were not identifiable. Mengele's friends provided the authorities with samples of what they said was the dead man's handwriting and it was confirmed as the same as Mengeles' SS application on file since the early 1930s. That was the only identification made. Obviously, Mengele's business associates' in .Brazil would have copies of his handwriting but what is astonishing is that the world would believe that' it was the handwriting of the dead man. The only people to claim to have proof that Yengele is dead are his family in Bavaria and his friends in Brazil. It is time we realized the danger posed by Nazis who have infiltrated organizations in an effort to achieve world dominance. Their presence and influence is everywhere. In the early 19401s, a young Polish salesman, employed by I.G. Farben, sold cyanide to the Nazis for use in Auschwitz. Fearing for his life after the war, he took refuge in the Catholic Church and was ordained a priest in late 1946. In 1958 he was ordained Poland's youngest bishop. After the thirty day reign and assassination of his predecessor, he assumed the Papacy as Pope John Paul 11. One of his first jobs in office was to canonize a Polish priest who was allegedly killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp. It has recent1 y been disclosed tha.t Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, who was Secretary General of the United Nations from 1972 until 1982, was in fact a Nazi intelligence officer who helped identify and execute thousands of non-military personncl in German occupied countries during the war. There was once a woman with a dream, a dream to give underprivileged women a choice through inexpensive or free birth control. The woman was Margaret Sanger who, in the conceptual stages of her Planned Parenthood organization. consulted with several of Hitler's social architects who saw her plan as a viable means to curb the birthrate of U.S. Blacks. which was, and still is, twice that of Whites. Recently. the U.S. extradited Nazi war criminal Andriya Artukovic to stand trial in Yugoslavia where he was sentenced to death by firing squad for ordering the execution of over 231.000 residents of the Xazi puppet state of Croatia.

California, while the U.S. government made every excuse imaginable to prevent his extradition to Yugloslavia. They even declared him senile and legally blind but that did not stop the Yugloslavians' pursuit and finally he was turned over to his executioners. The release of this 86 year old, terminally ill Nazi was just a token effort by the U.S. government to disguise the truth that. even to this day, over 26 Nazis are living in the U.S. under the protection of Washington. These Nazis are only the ones who nave been identified as war criminals and who have survived the forty-one years since the end.of World.War -11; Soon after the war, two Nazis hiding in the United States were facing extradition, trial and almost certain execution for their crimes against humanity when a brilliant young lawyer came to their defense. The lawyer instructed them to establish a business on paper only. He then arranged through his contacts in government for this phony company to be granted a military contract to supply some minor piece of hardware that was classified top secret. He then approached the courts with a defsnse that his Nazi clients should not be extradited because their company was necessary for national defense. The courts agreed and the Nazis were permitted to remain in the U.S. even though their shell of a company could not and did not fulfill the contract. The young lawyer went on to work with Senator YcCarthy to compile a list of Hollywood performers suspected of being \"communist sympathizers.\" Prominent on the Hollywood blacklist was the name of an actress whose family history would not seem to warrant her inclusion. Her mother had even worked as an undercover agent for the FBI. She was reportedly despondent over the prospect of never again being cast in one of her minor movie roles but actually she was about to embark on the most important theatrical performance of her life. Citing what she said was unfair treatment, she complained to the head of the Screen Actor's Guild who empathized with her problem and found that they had more than just a career in common. He and his ex-wife had worked as FBI informants who spied on their fellow actors. The two married only a few weeks after this first meeting. The young lawyer was Richard Nixon. The newlyweds were Ronald and Nancy Reagan. Nazis have attempted to control every political, social. economic, and religious power structure in the world today.

It is logical to assume that when the Nazis sold their spies in Russia to the CIA that they also sold their spies in the United States to the KGB. The Nazis' influence over the U.S. federal government has not gone unnoticed. In ear1.y 1979, just a few months after the Jonestown massacre, President Carter established a commission on the Holocaust that, among other duties. was to receive reports of any new attempts at genocide. Carter said. \"Never again will the world stand silent or 1ook.rhe other way in the face of genocide.\" Carter was well aware of the modern-day Nazi threat but his concern might have stemmed from the embarrassment or responsibility he felt since the largest attempt at genocide since World War I1 occurred under his administration. In any event, the commission never investigated Jonestown. Toward the end of his term, Carter helped establish a judiciary agency to ferret out Nazi war criminals in the United States. Until 1983, the chief Nazi-hunter in the U.S. government was Allen Ryan but, by this third year of the Reagan administration, most attempts to identify Nazis in government (and particularly in the CIA) were circumvented by President Reagan and Vice President Bush (a former director of the CIA). Reagan gave the agency sweeping new powers to spy on American citizens at home, operate domestic front companies and prosecute anyone who identified Agency personnel. He increased their budget and approved construction of a new wing on their headquarters. The recent growrh of the CIA is indicative of a fascist, right wing wave that is presently rampant in the United States. For our democracy to survive into the 21st century, Americans need to understand that their lives and freedom are in danger from an enemy that most believe was defeated over forty years ago. We are now only fifty years into Himmler's plan to purify the race of man in the first one hundred twenty-five years of the Thousand Year Reich. It would seem that the plan is still on schedule. Fifty years ago, the Nazis had to manually identify homosexuals and drug addicts, transport them to the death camps that they had to build. pay for the guards, the cyanide and the disposal of the corpses, all under public scrutiny and the chance that eventually they would have to answer for their genocidal crimes. Today, the very inexpensive AIDS virus performs the same function without the risk that the architects of the epidemic will ever be brought to justice."},{"pageNumber":686,"pageContent":"Laughing in Face of Death, B.

How did he become the 41st U.S. President? He is said to be a man of the \"old establishment,\" who \"chose to seek his fortune as an independent oilman. . . .\"' In fact, Bush was never \"independent.\" Every career step in his upward climb relied on his family's powerful associations. The Bush fami- ly joined the Eastern Establishment compara- tively recently, and only as servitors. Their wealth and influence resulted from their loyal- ty to another, more powerful family, and their willingness to do anything to get ahead. For what they did, Bush's forebears should have become very famous, or infamous. They remained obscure figures, managers from be- hind the scenes. But their actions--including his father's role as banker for Adolf Hitler- had tragic effects for the whole planet It was these services to his family's benefac- tors, which propelled George Bush to the top. 1. Prescott Goes to War President George Herbert Walker Bush was born in 1924, the son of Rescott S. Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush. We will begin the George Bush story about a decade before his birth, on the eveofworld War I. We will follow the career of his father, Prescott Bush, through his mar- riage with Dorothy Walker, as he moves along the path to fortune, elegance. and power. Prescott Bush entered Yale University in 1913. A native of Columbus. Ohio, Prescott had spent the last five years before college in St. George's Episcopal preparatory school in New- port. Rhode Island. Prescott Bush's first college year, 1913, was also the freshman year at Yale for E. Roland (\"Bunny?) Harriman, whose older brother (Wm.) Averell Harriman had just graduated from Yale. This is the Averell Harriman who .went on to fame as the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union during World War 11. as a governor of New York State. and as a presidential advis- er who was greatly responsible for starting the Vietnam War. The Harrimans would become the sponsors of the Bushes, to liR them onto the stage of world histow. In the spring of 1916, Prescott Bush and \"Bun- ny\" Hamman were chosen for membership in an elite Yale senior-year secret society known as Skull and Bones. This unusually morbid, death-celebrating group helped Wall Street fi- nanciers find active young men of \"good birth\" to form a kind of imitation British aristocracy in America. World War I was then raging in Europe. With the prospect that the U.S.A. would soon join the war, two Skull and Bones \"Patriarchs.\" Averell Hamman (class of 1913) and Percy A. Rockefel- ler(c1assof 19001, paid special attention to Pres- cott's class of 1917. They wanted reliable cadres to help them play the Great Game, in the lucra- tive new imperial era that the war was opening up for London and New York moneycrats. Pres- cott Bush, by then a close friend of \"Bunny\" Harriman, and several other Bonesmen from their class of 1917 would later comprise the core partners in Brown Brothers Hamman, the world's largest private investment bank. World War I did make an immense amount of money for the clan of stock speculators and British bankers who had just taken over U.S. industry. The Hammans wee stars of this new Anglo-American elite. , Averell's father. stock broker E.H. Harriman, had gained control of the Union Pacific Rail- road in 1898 with credit arranged by William Rockefeller, Percy's father, and by Kuhn Loeb 6 Co.'s British-affiliated private bankers, Otto Kahn. Jacpb Schiff and Felit.Qa.fburk William Rockefeller, treasurer of Standard Oil and brother of Standard founder John D. Rockefeller, owned National City Bank (later \"Citibank\") together with Texas-based James Stillman In return for their backing, E.H. Har- riman deposited in City Bank the vast receipts from his railroad lines. When he issued tens of millions of dollars of \"wateredn (fraudulent) railr~ad stock, Hamman sold most of the shares through the Kuhn Loeb company. The First World War elevated Prescott Bush' and his father. Samuel P. Bush, into iiieiower ranks of the Eastern Establishment As war loomed in 1914, National City Bank began reorganizingthe U.S. arms industry. Per- cy k Rockefeller took direct control of the Remington Arms company, appointing his own man. Samuel F. Pxyor, as the new chief execu- tive of Remington. The United States entered World War I in 1917. In the spring of 1918, Prescott's father, Samuel P. Bush, became chief of the Ordnance, Small Arms and Ammunition Section of the War Industries Board.' The 'senior Bush took national responsibility for government assis- ; tance to and relations with Remington and oth- er weapons companies. This was an unusual appointment, as Pres- cott's father seemed tq have no background in munitionr Samuel Bush had been president of the Buckeye Steel Castings Co. in Columbus, Ohio, makers of railcar parts. His entire career had been in the railroad business--supplying equipment to the Wd1 Street-owned railroad systems. The War Industries Board was run by Ber- nard Baruch. a Wall Street speculator with close personal and business ties to old E.H. Harriman. Baruch's brokerage firm had han- dled Harriman speculations of all kinds.' In 1918, Samuel Bush became director of the Facilities Division ofthe War Industries Board. Prescott's father reported to the boards chair- man, Bernard Baruch, and to Baruch's assis- tant. Wall Street private banker Clarence Dillon. Robert S. Lovett, president of Union Pacific Railroad, chief counsel to E.H. Hamman, and executor of his will, was id charge of national production and purchase \"priorities\" for Bar- uch's board. With the war mobilization conducted under the supervision of the War Industries Board, . U.S. consumers and taxpayers showered un- precedented fortunes,.gn war producers and certain holders of raw materials and patents.

Samuel Bush's wartime relationship to these businessmen would continue after the war, and would especially aid his son Prescott's career . of service to the Harrimans. Most of the records and correspondence of Samuel Bush's arms-related section of the gov- ernment have been burned, \"to save space\" in the National Archives. This matter ofdestroyed or misplaced records should be of concern to citizens of a constitutional republic. Unfortu- nalely, it is a rather constant impediment with regard to researching George Bush's back- ground: He is certainly the most ucovert.\"Amer- .ican chief executive. Now, arms production in wartime is by neces- sity camed on with great security precautions. The public need not know details of the private lives of the government or industry executives involved, and a broad interrelationship be- tween government and private-sector person- nel is normal and useful. But during the period preceding World War I, and in the war years 19141917 when the United States was still neutral, interlocking Wall Street financiers subservient to British strategy lobbied heavily, and twisted U.S. government and domestic police functions. Led by the J.P. Morgan concern, Britain's overall purchasing agent in America, these financiers wanted a world war and they wanted the United States in it as Britain's ally. The U.S. and British arms companies, owned by these international fi- nanciers, poured out weapons abroad in deals not subject to the scrutiny of any electorate back home. The same gentlemen. as we shall see, later supplied weapons and money to Hit- ler's Nazis. That this problem persists today, is in some respect due to the \"control\" over the documen- tation and the history of the arms traffickers. World War I was a disaster for civilized hu- manity. It had terrible, unprecedented casual- ties, and shattering effects on the moral philos- ophy of Europeans and Americans. But for a brief period, the war treated Pres- cott Bush rather well. In June 1918. just as his father took over re- sponsibility for relations of the government with the private arms producers, Prescott went to Europe with the U.S. Army. His unit did not come near any fire until September.. But on Au- gust 8,1918. the following item appeared on the front page of Bush's home-town newspaper: 3 High Military Honors Conferred on Capt. Bash For Notable Gallanty, When Leading AUied Commanders Wen Endungend, Local Man is Awarded French, English and U.S. Cnrsses. International Honors, perhaps unprecedent- ed in the life of an American soldier. have been conferred upon Captain hescott Sheldon Bush, son of Mr. and Mrs. S.P. Bush of Co- lumbus. i o Upon young Bush . . . were conferred: Cross , of the Legion of Honor, . . . Victoria Cross,. . . Distinguished Service Cross.. . . Conferring of the three decorations upon one man at one time implies recognition of a deed of rare valor and probably of great military im- portance as well. From word which has reached Columbus dur- ing the last few days, it appears as if the achievement ofcaptain Bush well measures up to these requirements. The incident occurred on the western front about the time the Germans were launching their great offensive ofJuly 15. . . . The history of the remarkable victory scored later by the allies might have been written in another vein, but for the heroic and quick action of Captain Bush. The . <. three allied leaders, General Foch, Sir Douglas Haig and General Pershing . . . were . making an inspection of American positions. General Pershing had sent for Captain Bush to guide them about one sector. As they approached a certain battery, it was evident that the place was being shelled by Ger- man 77s, but thegenerals mcv@qt',ii .' : ' It is possible a Gorntaafiddglqsp ceiv.ed i their movements, for a shell lit*atds n front of them. None was injured, although a fragment tore theboot of Captain Bush . ' The party then moved along more rapidly. Suddenly Captain Bush noticed a shell coming directly for them. He shouted a warning, sud- denly drew his bolo knife, stuck it up as he would a ball bat, and parried the blow, causing the shell to glance off to the right , .. The three generals marvelled at the exploit Apparently, they couldn't believe their eyes. They immediately took shelter and waited for the shelling to stop. Within 24 hours young Bush was notified.. . [that] the three allied commanders had recom- mended him for practically the highest honors within their gifi On the following day there was a parade in Paris of soldiers to be decorated. As he was the only one to receive three honors, Captain Bush was placed at the head of the procession. Captain Bush is 23 years old. a graduate of Yale in the class of 1917. He was one of Yale's best-known athletes.. . was leader of the glee club . . . and in his senior year was elected to the famous Skull and Bones Society. . . .\" The day after this astonishing story ap peared, there was a large cartoon on the edito- rial page. It depicted Prescott Bush as a small boy, reading a story-book about military hero- ism, and saying: \"Gee! I wonder if anything like that could ever truly happen to a boy.\" The cap tion below was a rehash of the batting-away- the-deadly-shell exploit, written in storybook style.' Local excitement about the military \"Babe Ruth\" lasted just four weeks. Then this somber little box appeared on the front page: Editor State Journal: A cable received from .my son. hescott S.

President ~heodore Roosevelt had de- nounced Harriman's father for \"cynicism and deep-seated corruption\" and called him an \"un- desireable citizen.'* For the still-smarting Av- erell to take his place among the makers and breakers of nations, he needed a financial and intelligencegathering organization of his own. The man Harriman sought to create such an institution for him was Bert Walker, a Missouri stock broker and corporate wheeler-dealer. . George Herbert (\"Bert\") Walker, for whom President George H.W.

Bert Walker was known as the Midwest's pre- mier deal-arranger, awarding the investment capital of his international-banker contacts to the many railroads, utilities, and other mid- western industries of which he and his St Louis friends were executives or board members. Walker's operations were always quiet, or mysterious, whether in local or global affairs. He had long been the \"power behind the throne\" in the St Louis Democratic Party, along with his crony, former Missouri Governor David R Francis. Walker and Francis together .had sufficient influence to select the party's candi- dates.'' Back in 1004, Bert Walker, David Francis, Washington University President Robert Brooking and their bankerlbroker circle had organized a world's fair in St Louis, the Louisi- ana Purchase Exposition. In line with the old Southern Confederacy family backgrounds of many of these sponsors, the fair featured a \"Hu- man Zoo\": live natives from overseas jungle re- gions, and American Indians who were federal prisoners, were exnibited in walled com- pounds under the supervision of anthropologist WiIIiam J. McCee. So Averell Harriman was a natural patron for Bert Walker. Bert shared Averell's passion for hone breeding and horse racing, and easily ac- commodated the Harriman family's related so- cial philosophy. They believed that the horses and racing stables they owned showed the way toward a sharp upgradingof the human stock- just select and mate thoroughbreds, and spurn or eliminate inferior animals.

As the Bolshevik Revolution broke out. we find Bert Walker busy appointing people to Francis's staff in ~etroqad.'~ Walker's earliest activities in relation to the soviet state are of significant interest to histori- ans, given the activist role he was to play there together with Harriman. But Walker's life is as covert as the rest of the Bush clan's, and the surviving public record is extremely thin. The 1919 Versailles peace conference brought together British imperial strategists and their American friends to make postwar global arrangements. For his own intended in- ternational adventures. Harriman needed Bert Walker, the seasoned intriguer, who quietly represented many of the British-designated rulers of American politics and finance. After two persuasion trips west by Harri- man.\" Walker at length agreed to move to New York But he kept his father's summer house in Kennebunkport. Maine. Bert Walker formally organized the W. A. Harriman & Co. private bank in November 1919. Walker became the bank's president and chief executive; Averell Harriman was chairman and controlling co-owner with his brother Roland (\"Bunny\"), Prescott Bush's close friend from Yale; and Percy Rockefeller was a director and a founding financial sponsor. In the autumn of 1919, Prescott Bush made the acquaintance of Bert Walker's daughter Dorothy. They were engaged the following year, and were married in August, 1921.\" The society page of a St Louis newspaper described the gala affair: The marriage of Miss Dorothy Walker, daugh- ter of Mr. and Mrs. G. Herbert Walker of New York, formerly of this city, and Mr. Prescott Sheldon Bush took place Friday afiernoon at the Walker summer home, 'Surf Lodge,' in Ken- nebunckport Isicl, Me.. . . Guests from summer resorts along the New Hampshire and Massa- chusetts coasts were present at the reception. . . . The spacious grounds surrounding the Walker country home made a charming setting for the dainty summer frocks of the guests. . . . The bridesmaids included . . . Miss Isabel Rockefeller [daughter of Percy Rockefeller]. . . of New Yort . . . The bride came out two years ago and was invited to join the Imperial in her debut year, and was also a member of the Junior League. She is related td many families of prominence in St Louis. . . . Among the 11 \"ushers and groomsmen\" named were Henry P. Isham, Ellery S. James,. Samuel Duryee, Frank P. Shepard, Knight Woolley, and Henry Fenimore Cooper, all fel- low Skull and Bonesmen from the Yale Class of 1~17.l~ The Bush-Walker extended family has gath- ered each summer at the \"Walker country home\" in Kennebunkport. from this marriage of President Bush's parents down to the present day. When Prescott married Dorothy, he was only a minor executive of the Simmons Co., railroad equipment suppliers. while his wife's father was building one of the most gigantic business- es in the world. The following year the couple tried to move back to Columbus, Ohio; there Prescott worked for a short time in a rubber products company owned by his father. But they soon moved again to Milton, Mass., after outsid- ers bought the little family business and moved it near there. Thus Prescott Bush was going nowhere fast, when his son George Herbert Walker Bush- the future U.S. President-was born in Milton, Mass.. on June 12,1924. Perhaps it was as a birthday gift for George, that \"Bunny\" Harriman stepped in to rescue his father Prescott from oblivion, bringing him into the Harriman-controlled U.S. Rubber Co. in New York City. In 1925 the young family moved to the town where George was to grow up: Greenwich, Connecticut, a suburb both of New York and of New Haven~Yale. Then, on May 1, 1926, Rescott Bush joined W.A. Harriman & Co. as its vice president, un- der the bank's president, Bert Walker, his fa- ther-in-law and George's maternal grandfa- 05 67 ther-the head of the family.\""},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"The Great Game Prescott Bush would demonstrate strong loy- alty to the firm he joined in 1926. And the bank. with the scope and power of many ordinary na- tions, could amply reward its agents. George Bush's Grandfather Walker had put the enter- prise together, quietly, secretly, using all the international connections at his disposal. Let us briefly look back at the beginning of the Har- riman firm-the Bush family enterprise-and follow its course into one of history's darkest projects. The firm's first global lever was its successful arrangement to get into Germany by domi- nating that country's shipping. Averell Harri- man announced in 1920 that he would re-start Germany's Hamburg-Amerika Line. after many months of scheming and arm-twisting. Hambu- rg-Amerika's commercial steamships had been confiscated by the United States at the end of the First World War. These ships had then be- come the property of the Harriman enterprise, by some arrangements with the U.S. authorities that were never made public. The deal was breathtaking; it would create the world's largest private shipping line. Hamburg-Amerika Line regained its confis- cated vessels, for a heavy price. The Harriman enterprise took \"the right to participate in 50 percent of all business ojiginated in Hamburg\"; and for the next twenty years (1920-19401, the Harriman enterprise had \"complete control of all activities of the Hamburg line in the United States.\" '' Harriman became co-owner of Hamburg-Am- erika. The Harriman-walker firm gained a tight hold on its management, with the not-so-subtle backing of the post-World War I occupation of Germany by the armies of England and America. Just after Harriman's public statement, the . SL Louis press celebrated Bert Walker's role in assembling the money to consummate the deal: ExSt. Louisan Fonns Giant Ship Merger G. H. Walker is Moving Power Behind Harr- iman-Morton Shipping Combine. . :. The story celebrated a \"merger of two big finankial houses in New York. which will place practically unlimited capital at the disposal of the new American-German shipping combine. r110 Bert Walker had arranged a \"marriage\" of J.P. Morgan credit and Harriman family inher- ited wealth. W.A. Harriman & Co., of which Walker was president and founder. was merging with the Morton & Co. private bank-and Yalker was \"[pjrominent in the affairs of Morton 6 Co.;\" which was interlocked with the Morgan-con- trolled Guaranty Trust Co. The Hamburg-Amerika takeover created an effective instrument for the manipulation and fatal subversion of Germany. One of the great \"merchants of death,\" Samuel Pryor, was in it from the beginning. Pryor, then chairmanofthe executive committee of Remington Arms, helped arrange the deal and served with Walk- er on the board of Harriman's shipping front organization, the American Ship and Com- merce Co. Walker and Harriman took the next giant step in 1922, setting up their European headquar- ters office in Berlin. With the aid of the Hambu- rg-based Warburg bank, W.A. Haniman & Co. began spreading an investment net over Ger- man industry and raw materials. From the Berlin base, Walker and Harriman then plunged into deals with the new dictator- ship of the Soviet Union. They led a select group of Wall Street and British Empire speculators who re-started the Russian oil industry, which had been devastated by the Bolshevik Revolu- tion. They contracted to mine Soviet manga- nese, an element essential to modern steelmak- ing. These concessions were &ranged directly with Leon Trotsky, then with Feliks Dzerzhin- sky, founder of the Soviet dictatorship's secret intelligence service (KGB), whose huge statue was finally pulled down by pro-democracy dem- onstrators in 1991. These speculations created both channels of communication and the style of accommoda- tion with the communist dictatorship, that have continued in the family down to President Bush. With the bank launched, Bert Walker found New York the ideal place to satisfy his passion for sports, games and gambling. Walker was elected president of the United States Golf As- sociation (USGA) in 1920. He negotiated new international rules for the game with the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews. Scotland. Aner these talks he contributed the three-foot- high silver Walker Cup, for which British and American teams have since competed every two years. Bert's son-in-law Prescott Bush was later sec- retary of the U.S. Golf Association, in the grave political and economic crises of the early 1930s. Prescott became USGA President in 1935, while he was otherwise embroiled in the family firm's work with Nazi Germany. When George was one year old, in 1925, Bert Walker and Averell Harriman headed a syndi- cate which rebuilt Madison Square Garden as the modern Palace of Sport. Walker was at the center of New York's gambling scene in its hey- day. in that Prohibition era of colorful and bloody gangsters. The Garden bloomed with million-dollar prize fights; bookies and their clients pooled more millions. trying to match the pace of the speculation-crazed stock and bond men. This was the era of \"organized\" crime-the national gambling and bootleg syn- dicate structured on the New York corporate model. By 1930, when George was a boy ofsix. Grand- pa Walker was New York State RacingCommis- sioner. The vivid colors and sounds of the rac- ing scene must have impressed little George as much as his grandfather. Bert Walker bred race horses at his own stable, the Log Cabin Stud. He was president of the Belmont Park race track. Bert also personally managed most as- pects of Averell's racing interests--down to picking the colors and fabrics for the Harriman racing gear.'\""},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"From 1926, George's father Prescott Bush showed a fierce loyalty to the Harrimans and a dogged determination to advance himself; he gradually came to run the day-to-day opera- tions of W.A. Harriman & Co. After the firm's 1931 merger with the British-American banking house Brown Brothers, Prescott Bush became managing parlner of the resulting company: Brown Brothers Harriman. This was ultimately the largest and politically the most important private banking house in America. Financial collapse, world depression, and so- cial upheaval followed the fevered speculation of the 1920s. The 1929-31 crash of securities val- ues wiped out the small fortune Prescott Bush had gained since 1926. But because ofhis devo- tion to the Harrimans, they \"did a verygenerous thing,\" as Bush later put it. They staked him to what he had lost and put him back on his feet Prescott Bush described his own role, from 1931 through the 1940s, in a confidential in- terview: \"I em~hasize . . . that the Harrimans showed great courage and loyalty and confidence in us, because three or four of us were really running the business, the day to day business. Averell was all over the place in those days . . . and Roland was involved in a lot of directorships, and he didn't get down into the 'liR-upand- beardown' activity of the bank, you see--the day-to-day decisions. . . we were really running the business, the day to day business, all the administrative decisions and the executive de- cisions. We were the ones that did it We were the managing partners, let's say.\"\" But of the \"three or four\" partners in charge. Prescott was effectively at the head of the firm, because he had taken over management of the gigantic personal investment funds of Averell and E Roland \"Bunny\" Harriman. In those interwar years, Prescott Bush made the family fortune which George Bush inher- ited. He piled up the money from an interna- tional project which continued until a new world war, and the action of the U.S. govern- ment, intervened to stop him. 1. Worhmgton Port. Aug. 16.1991. p.

The Bush Family and the Hitler Project I n October 1942, ten months after entering World War 11, America was preparing its first assault against Nazi military forces. Prescott Bush,was managing partner of Brown Brothers Hamman. His 18yearsld son George, the future U.S. President, had just begun train- ing to become a naval pilot On October 20,1942, the U.S. government or- dered the seizure of Nazi German banking op- erations in New York City which were being conducted by Prescott Bush. Under the Trading with the Enemy Act, the government tookover the Union Banking Cop ration, in which Bush was a director. The U.S. Alien Property Custodiah seized 'Union Bank- ing Corp.'s stock shares, all of which were owned by Prescott Bush, E. Roland \"Bunny\" Harriman, three Nazi executives, and two other associates of Bush.' The order seizing the bank \"vest[edl [seized] all of the capital stock of Union Banking Corpe ration, a New York corporation,\" and named the holders of its shares as: \"E.

The order also specified: \"all of which shares are held for the benefit of.. . members of the Thyssen family, [andl is property of nationals . . . of a designated enemy country. . . .\" . By October 26,1942 U.S.'troops werewnder- way for North Africa..On October28, the govern- ment issued orders seizing two Nazi front orga- nizations run by the Bush-Harriman bank: the Holland-American Trading Corporation and the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation.? - U.S. forces landed under fire near Algiers on November8,1942, heavy combat raged through- out November. Nazi interests in the Silesian- American Corporation, long managed by Pres- cott Bush and his father-in-law George'Herbert Walker. were seized under the Trading with the Enemy Act on November 17,1942. In this action, the government announced that it was seizing only the Nazi interests, leaving the Nazis' U.S. partners to carry on the business.' These and other actions taken by the U.S. government in wartime were, tragically, too lit- tle and too late. President Bush's family had already played a central role in financing and arming Adolf Hitler for his takeover of Germa- ny; in financing and managing the buildup of Nazi war industries for the conquest of Europe and war against the U.S.A.; and in the develop ment of Nazi genocide theories and racial pro- paganda, with their well-known results. The facts presented here must be known, and their implications reflected upon, for a proper understanding of President George Herbert Walker Bush and of the danger to mankind that he represents. The President's family fortune was largely a result of the Hitler project. The powerful Anglo-American family associations, which later boosted him into the Central Intel- ligence Agency and up to the White House, were his father's partners in the Hitler project. President Franklin Roosevelt's Alien Prop- erty Custodian, Leo T. Crowley, signed Vesting Order Number 248 seizing the property of Pres- cott Bush under the Trading with Enemy Act. The order, published in obscure government record books and kept out of the news,' ex- plained nothing about the Nazis involved; only that the Union Banking Corporation was run for the 'Thyssen family\" of \"Germany andlor Hungaryw-\"nationals . . . of a designated ene- my country.\" Hy deciding that Prescott Bush and the other directors of the Union Banking Corp. were le- gally Fwzt men fw the Naris, the government avoided the more important bistorical issue: In what way were Hitler's Nazis themselves hired, anned, and instmted by the New York and Lon- don clique of which Prescott Bush was an exec- utive manager? Let us examine the Harriman- Bush Hitler project from the 1920s until it was partially broken up, to seek an answer for that question. Origin and Extent of the project- Fritz Thyssen and his business partners are universally recognized as the most important German financiers of Adolf Hitler's takeover of Germany. At the time of the order seizing the Thyssen family's Union Banking Corp., Mr. Fritz Thyssen had already published his fa- mous book, I Paid Hitler,' admitting that he had financed Adolf Hitler and the Nazi movement since October 1923. Thyssen's role as the lead- ing early backer of Hitler's grab for power in Germany had been noted by U.S. diplomats in Berlin in 1932.9he order seizing the Bush- Thyssen bank was curiously auiet and modest ..nboutlbe identity of the p&e@atFw@ had been nailed. But two weeks before the official order, gov- ernment investigators had reported secretly that \"W. Averell Harriman was in Europe some- time prior to 1924 and at that time became ac- quainted with Fritz Thyssen, the German indus- trialist\" Harriman and Thyssen agreed to set up a bank for Thyssen in New York 'IClertain of [Harriman'sl associates would serve as'direc- tors.. . .\" Thyssen agent \"HJ. Kouwenhoven . . . came to the United States.. . prior to 1924 for conferences with the Hamman Company in this connection.. . .\"' When exactly was \"Harriman in ~uro~e sometime prior to 1924\"? In fact, he was in Ber- lin in 1922 to set up the Berlin branch of W.A. Harriman 6 Co. under George Walker's presi- dency."},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"The Union Banking Corporation was estab- lished formally in 1924, as a unit in the Manhat- tan offices of W.A. Harriman & Co., interlocking with the Thyssen-owned Bank VOM Handel en Scheepvaart (BHS) in the Netherlands. The in- vestigators concluded that \"the Union Banking Corporation has since its inception handled funds chiefly supplied to it through the Dutch bank by the Thyssen interests for American in- vestment\" Thus by personal agreement between Aver- ell Harriman and Fritz Thyssen in 1922, W.A. Harriman & Co.'(alias Union Banking Corpora- tion) would be transferring funds back and forth between New York and the \"Thyssen in- terests\" in Germany. By putting up about $400,000, the Harriman organization would be joint owner and manager of Thyssen's banking operations outside of Germany. How important was the Nazi enterprise for which Resident Bush's father was the New York banker? The 1942 U.S. government investigative re- port said that Bush's Nazi-front bank was an interlocking concern with the Vereinigte Stah- lwerke (United Steel Works Corporation or Ger- man Skel Trust) led by Fritz Thyssen and his two brothers. After the war, congressional in- vestigators probed the Thyssen interests, Union Banking Corp. and related Nazi units. The investigation showed that the Vereinigte Stahlwerke had produced the following ap- proximate proportions of total German nation- al output: 50.8% of Nazi Germany's pig iron; -41.4% of Nazi Germany's universal plate; 36.0% of Nazi Germany's heavy plate; 38.a of Nazi Germany's galvanized sheet; 45.5% of Nazi Ger- many's pipes and tubes; 221% of Nazi Gma- ny's wire; 35.096 of Nazi Germany's explosives.' This accounts for many, many Nazi subma- rines, bombs, rifles, gas chambers, etc. Prescott Bush became vice president of W.A. Hamman & Co. in 1926. That same year, a friend of Harriman and Bush set up a giant new organization for their client Fritz Thyssen, prime sponsor of politician Adolf Hitler. The new Gennan Steel T~ust, Germany's largest in- dustrial corporation, was organized in 1926 by Wall Street banker Clarence Dillon. Dillon was the old comrade of hescott Bush's father Sam Bush from the \"Merchants of Deathn bureau in World War I. In return for putting up $70 million to create his organization, majority owner Thyssen gave $he Dillo$sead cempany two or more repre- sentatives on theboard of the new Steel Trusts Thus there is a division of labor: Thyssen's own confidential accounts. for political and re- lated purposes, were run through the Walker- Bush organization; the Steel Trust did its corpo- rate banking through Dillon Read. The Walker-Bush firm's banking activities were not just politically neutral money-making ven- tures which happened to coincide with the aims of German Nazis. All of the firm's European business in those days was organized around antidemocratic political forces. In 1927, criticism of their support for totali- . . tarianism drew this retort from Bert Walker, , written from Kennebunkport to Averell Harri- man: \"It seems to me that the suggestion in con- nection with Lord Bearsted's views that we withdraw from Russia smacks somewhat of the impertinent.. . I think that we have drawn our 1ine.and should hew to it\"'' Averell Harriaan met with Italy's fascist dic- tator, Benito Mussolini. A representative ofthe firm subsequently telegraphed good news back to his chief executive Bert Walker: \". . . During these last days.. . Mussolini . . . has examined and approved our ~[olntract 15 June.\"\" The great financial collapse of 1929-31 shook America, (;emany, and Britain, weakening all governments. It also made the hard-pressed \"The President's family fortune was largely a result of the Hitler project. The powcrfnl Anglo-American family associations, which later boosted him into the CIA and up to the White House, were his fathds partners in the Hitler project.\" Prescott Bush even more willingto do whatever was necessary to retain his new place in the world. It was in this crisis that certain Angio- Americans determined on the installation of a Hitler regime in Germany. W.k Hamman & Co., well-positioned for this enterprise and rich in assets from their German and Russian business, merged with the British- . American investment house, Brown Brothers. on January.1, 1931. Bert Walker retired to his own G.$. Walker & Co. This left the Harriman brothers, Prescott Bush, and Thatcher M. Brown as the senior partners of the new Brown Brothers Harriman firm. (The London, England branch of the Brown family firm continued op erating under its historic name-Brown, Shipley.) Robert A. Lovett also came over as a partner from Brown Brothers. His father, EH. Ham- man's lawyer and railroad chief, had been on the War Industries Board with Prescott's fa- ther. Though he remained a partner in Brown Brothers Harriman, the junior Lovett soon re- placed his father as chief exexcutive of Union Pacific Railroad. Brown Brothers had a racial tradition that fitted it well for the Hitler project American patriots had cursed its name back in Civil War days. Brown Brothers, with offices in the U.S.A. and in England, had carried on their ships fully 75 percent of the slave cotton from the Ameri- can South over to British mill owners; through their usurious credit they controlled and ma- nipulated the slave-owners. Now, in 1931, the virtual dictator of world finance, Bank of England Governor Montagu Collet Norman, was a former Brown Brothers partner, whose grandfather had been boss of Brown Brothers during the U.S. Civil War. Mon- dagu Norman was known as the most avid of Hitler's supporters within British ruling cir- cles, and Norman's intimacy with this firm was essential to his management of the Hitler"},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"In 1931, while Rescot!

Let us look more closely at the Bush family's German partners. Fritz Thyssen told Allied interrogators after the war about some of his financial support for the Nazi Party: \"In 1930 or 1931 . . .I told [Hit- ler's deputy Rudolph] Hess . . . I would arrange a credit for him with a Dutch bank in Rotter- dam, the Bank fir Handel und Schiff [i.e. Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart(BHS1, the Harrim- an-Bush affiliate]. I arranged the credit.. . he would pay it back in three years. . . . I chose a Dutch bank because I did not want to be mixed up with German banks in my position, and be- cause I thought it was better to do business with a Dutch bank. and I thought I would have the Nazis a little more in my hands. . . . The credit was about 250.300,000 [gold] marks-about the sum I had given before. The loan has been repaid in part to the Dutch bank. but I think some money is still owingon it.. .\"I4 The overall total of Thyssen's political dona- tions and loans to the Nazis was well over a million dollars, including funds he raised from others--in a period of terrible money-shortage in Germany. . Friedrich Flick was the major eoownerofthe German Steel Trust with Fritz Thyssen, Thys- sen's longtime collaborator and sometime com- petitor. In preparation for the war crimes tribu- nal at Nuremberg, the U.S. government said that Flick was \"one of leading financiers and industrialists who from 1932 contributed large sums Lo the Nazi Party . . . member of 'Circle of Friends' of Himmler who contributed large sums to the SS.\"\" Flick, like Thyssen, financed the ~azis to mainlain their private armies called Schutzs- taffel (S.S. or Black Shirts) and Sturmabteilung (S.A., storm troops or Brown Shirts). The Flick-Harriman partnership was direct- ly supervised' by Prescott Bush, Resident Bush's father, and by George Walker, President Bush's grandfather. The Harriman-Walker Union Banking Corp. arrangements for the German Steel Trust had made them bankers for Flick and his vast oper- ations in Germany by no later than 1926. The Harriman Pin Corpontion (George Walker. president Prescott Bush and Averell Harriman, sole directors) held a substantial stake in the Siiesian Holding Co. at the time . of the merger with Brown Brothers, January 1, 1931. This holding correlated to Averell Ham- man's chairmanship of the Consolidated Silo sian Steel Corporation, the American group owning one-third of a complex of steelmaking, coal-mining and zinc-mining activities in Ger- many and Foland, in which Friedrich Flick owned two-thirds.'\" , . The Nuremberg prosecutor characterized Flick as follows: \"Proprietor and head 0f.a 1arge.group of in- dustrial enterprises (coal and iron mines, steel producing and fabricating plants) . . .

On March 19, 1934,:Prescott Bush-then di- rector of the Gernian Steel Trust's Union Bank- ing Corppration-initiated an alert to the ab- sentaAverell Harriman about a problem which had developed in the Flick partnership.\" Bush sent Hamman a clipping from the New Yodc Times of that day, which reported that the Pol-' ish government was fighting back against Amer- ican and German stockholders who controlled \"Poland's largest industrial unit, the Upper Si- lesian Coal and Steel Compapy. . . .\" The Times article continued: The company has long been accused of mismanagement, ex- cessive borrowing, fictitious bookkeeping and gambling in securities. Warrants were issued in December for several directors accused of tax evasio~s., They were German citizens and they fled. They were replaced by Poles Herr Flick, regarding this as an attempt to make the company's board entirely Polish, retaliated by restricting credits until'the new Polish direc- tors were unable to pay the workmen regu- larly.\" The Times noted that the company's mines and mills \"employ 25,000 men and account for 45 percent of Poland's total steel output and 12 percent of her coal. production. Tw~thirds of the company's stock is owned by Friedrich Flick, a leading German steel industrialist, and the remainder is owned by interests in the Unit- ed States.\" In view of the fact that a great deal of Polish output was being exported to Hitler's Germany under depression cbiiditions, the Polish gov- ernment thought that Bush, Harriman, and their Nazi partners should at least pay full tax- es on their Polish holdings.

Three years later, nearly a year afler the Jap anese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. govern- ment ordered the seizure of the Nazis' share in the Silesian-American Corporation under the Trading with the Enemy Act Enemy nationals were said to own 49 percent of the common stock and 41.67 percent of the preferred stock of the company.

Control of Nazi Commerce Bert Walker had arranged the credits Harri- man needed to take control of the Hamburg- Amerika Line back in 1920. Walker had orga- nized the American Ship and Commerce Corp. as a unit of the W.A. Harriman & Co.. with con- tractual power over Hamburg-Amerika's af- fairs. As the Hitler project went into high gear, Harriman-Bush shares in American Ship and Commerce Corp. were held by the Harriman Fifteen Corp., run by Prescott Bush and Bert Walker.= Roland (\"Bunny\") Harriman, left, and his brother chairman of the Union Banking ~~rp~ration, the Hitler's main German sponsor: Fritz Th~sSen.

Walker & Co.--and around the corner to his subsidiary offices at 39 Broadway, former home of the old W.k Harriman & Co., and still the offices for American' Ship and Commerce, and of the Union Banking Corporation. In many ways, Bush's Hamburg-Amerika Line was the pivot for the entire Hitler project. Averell Harriman and Bert Walker had gained control over the steamship company in 1920 in negotiations yith its post-World War I chief executive, WlllCCIm Cuno, and with the line's bankers, MA Warburg. Cuno was there- after completely. dependent on the Anglo- Americans, and became a member ofthe Anglo- German Friendship Society. In the 1930-32 drive for a Hitler dictutorship, Wilhelm Cuno contributed important sums to the Nazi Party.\" Albert Voegler was chief executive of the Thyssen-Flick German Steel Trust for which Bush's Union Banking Corp. was the New York office. He was a director of the Bush-affiliate BHS Bank in Rotterdam, and a director of the Harriman-Bush Hamburg-Amerika Line. Voegler joined Thyssen and Flick in their heavy 1930-33 Nazi contributions. and helped organize the final Nazi leap into national power.\" The Schroeder family of bankers was a linch- pin for the Nazi activities of Harriman and Prescott Bush, closely tied to their lawyers Al- len and John Foster Dulles.

Since Mr. Pryor was executive committee chairman of Remington Arms and a central figure in the world's private arms trafiic, his use to the Hitler project was enhanced as the Bush family's partner in Nazi Party banking and trans-Atlantic shipping. The U.S. Senate arms-traffic investigators probed Remington atter it was joined in a cartel agreement on explosives to the Nazi firm LC. Farben. hoking at the period leading up to Hitler's seizure of power, the senators found that \"German political associations, like the Nazi and others, are nearly all armed with American. . . guns.. . . Arms of all kinds coming from America are transshipped in the Scheldt to river barges before the vessels arrive in Ant- werp. They then can be carried through Hol- land without police inspection or interference. The Hitlerists and Communists are presumed to get arms in this manner. The principal arms coming from America are Thompson subma- chine,pns and revolvers. The number is great. The beginning of the Hitler regime brought some bizarre changes to the Hamburg-Amerika Line-and more betrayals. 'Prescott Bush's American Ship and Com- merce Corp. notified Max Warburg of Hamburg, Germany, on March 7,1933. that Warburg was to be the corporation's official, designated rep resentative on the board of Hamburg- ~meri ka.* Max Warburg replied on March 27,1933. as- suring his ~merican sponsors that the Hitler government was good for Germany: \"For the last few years business was considerably better than we had anticipated, but a reaction is mak- ing itself felt for some months. We are actually suffering also under the very active propagan- da against Germany, caused by some unpleas- ant circumstances. These occurrknces were the , natural consequence of the very excited elec- tion campaign, but were extraordinarily exag- gerated in the foreign press. The Government is firmly resolved to maintain public peace and order in Germany, and I feel perfectly con- vinced in this respect that there is no cause for any alarm what~oever.\"~~ This seal of approval for Hitler, coming from a famous Jew, was just what Harriman and Bush required, for they anticipated rather serious \"alarm\" inside the U.S.A. against their Nazi op erations. On March 29,1933, two days a~er ifax's letter to Harriman, Max's son Erich sent a cable to his cousin Frederick bf. Warburg. a director of the Harriman railroad system. He asked Frederick to \"use all your influence\" to stop all anti-Nazi activity in'America, including \"atrocity news and unfriendly propaganda in foreign press, mass meetings, etc.\" Frederick cabled back to Erich: \"No responsible groups here [are] urging [a] boycott [ofl German goods[,] merely excited individuals.\" Two days atter that, On March 31, 1933, the AmericanJewish Committee, con- trolled by the Warburgs, and the B'nai B'rith, heavily influenced by the Sulzbergers' (New York Times), issued a formal, official joint state- ment of the two organizations, counse1ling\"that na American boycott against Germany be en- couraged, [and advising] . . . that no further mass meetings be held or similar forms of agita- tion be employed.'*' The Aherican Jewish Committee and the B'nai B'rith (mother of the \"Anti-Defamation League\") continued with this hardline, no-at- tack-on-Hitler stance all through the 19305, blunting the fight mounted by many Jews and other anti-fascists. Thus the decisive interchange reproduced above, taking place entirely within the orbit of the HarrimanJBush firm, may explain some- thing of the relationship of George Bush to American Jewish and Zionist leaders. Some of them, in close cooperation with his family, play- ed an ugly part in the drama of Naziism. Is this why 'professional Nazi-hunters\" have never discovered how the Bush family made its. money? ,* .' 0.

In May 1933, just after the Hitler regime was consolidated, an agreement was reached in Berlin for the coordination of all Nazi com- merce with the U.S.A The Horrirmn Intern- tional Co., led by Averell Harriman's first cous- in Oliver, was to head a syndicate of 150 firms and individuals, to conduct all -from Hit- ler's Gennany to the Unitcd ~t4ks.' This pact had been negotiated in Berlin be- tween Hitler's economics minister, Hjalmar Schacht, and John Foster Dulles, international attorney for dozens of Nazi enterprises, with the counsel of Max Warbug and, Kurt von Schroeder. John Foster Dulles would later be U.S. Secre- tary of State, and the great power in the Repub lican Party of the 19509. Foster's friendship and that of his brother Allen (head of the Central Intelligence Agency), greatly aided Prescott Bush to become the Republican U.S. senator from Connecticut And it was to be of inestima- ble value to George Bush, in his ascent to the heights ofUcovert action government,\" that both of these Dulles brothers were the lawyers for the Bush family's far-dung enterprise. Throughout the 1930s. John Foster Dulles ar- ranged debt restructuring for German firms un- der a series of decrees issued by Adolf Hitler. In these deals, Dulles struck a balance between the interest owed to selected, larger investors, and the needs of the growing Nazi warmaking apparatu9 for producing tanks, poison gas, etc. Dulles wrote to Prescott Bush in 1037 con- cerning one such arrangement The German- Atlantic Cable Company, owning Nazi Germa- ny's only telegraph channel to the United States, had made debt and management agree- ments with the Walker-Harriman bank during the 1920s. A new decree would now void those agreements, which had originally . . been reached with non-Nazi corporate otlicials. Dulles asked Bush, who managed these affairs for Averell Harriman. to get Averell's signature on a letter to Nazi officiab, agreeing to the changes. Dulles wrote: \"Sept 22,1937 \"Mr. Prescott S. Bqsh \"59 Wall Street, New York, N.Y. \"Dear Press, \"I have looked over the letter of the German- American [sic] Cable Company to Averell Har- riman.. . .

The money was to be used instead for arming the Nazi state, under a decree of the Hitler government. Despite the busy efforts of Bush and Dulles, a New York court decided that this particular Hitler \"law\" was invalid in the United States; small bondholders, not parties to deals be- tween the bankers and the Nazis, were entitled to get paid.= In this and a few other of the attempted swin- dles, the intended victims came out with their money. But the Nazi financial and political re- organization went ahead to its tragic climax. For his part in the Hitler revolution, Prescott Bush was paid a fortune. This is the legacy he left to his son, President George Bush. I t was not ineoikble tbat millions would be slaughtered under fascism -and in World War IL At certain moments of crisis, cmcial pro-Nazi decisions were made outside of Ger- many. These decisions for pro-Nazi actions were more aggressive than the mere \"appease- ment\" which Anglo-American historians later preferred to discuss. Private annies of 300,000 to 400,000 terrorists aided the Nazis' rise to power. EH. Harriman's Hamburg-Amerika line intervened against Ger- many's 1932 attempt to break them up. The 1-31 economic collapse bankrupted the Wall-Street-backed German Steel Trust When the German government took over the Trust's stock shares, interests associated with Konrad Adenauer and the anti-Nazi Catholic Center Party attempted to acquire the shares.

Kuhn Loeb asked North German Lloyd bondholders to accept new lower interest steamship bonds, issued by Kuhn Loeb, in place ofthe better pre- Hitler bonds. The Opposition New York attorney Jacob Chaitkin, father of coauthor Anton Chaitkin, took the cases of many different bondholders who rejected the swindle by Harriman, Bush, Warburg, and Hit- ler.

The American Federa- tion of Labor cooperated with Jewish and other groups in the anti-import boycott On the other side,virtually all the Nazi trade with the United . States was under the supervision of the Harri- man interests and functionaries such as Res- cott Bush, father of Resident George Bush Meanwhile, the Warburgs demanded that American Jews not \"agitate\" against the Hitler government, or join the organized boycott The Warburgs' decision was carried out by the American Jewish Committee and the B'M~ B'rith, who opposed the boycott as the Nazi mili- tary state grew increasingly powerf'ul. The historical coverup on these events is so tight that virtually the only expose of the War- burgs came in journalist John L Spivak's \"Wall Street's Fascist Conspiracy,\" in the pro-commu- nist New Mosses periodical (January29 and Feb ruary 5,1934). Spivak pointed out that the War- burgs controlled the American Jewish Commit- tee, which opposed the anti-Nazi boycott, while their Kuhn Loeb and Co. had underwritten Nazi shipping; and he exposed the financing of pro- fascist political activities by the Warburgs and their partners and allies, many of whom were bigwigs in the American Jewish Committee and B'nai B'rith. Given where the Spivak piece appeared, it is not surprising that Spivak called Warburg an ally of the Morgan Bank, but made no mention of Averell Hamman. Mr. Harriman, aRer all. was a permanent hero of the Soviet Union. John L Spivak later underwent a curious transformation, himself joining the coverup. In 1966, he wrote an autobiography which praises the American Jewish Committee. The pro-fas- cism of the Warburgs does not appear in the book. The former \"rebel\" Spivak also praises 0576 the action arm of the B'nai B'rith, the~ki-Defa- mation League. Pathetically, he comments fa- vorably that the League has spy files on the American populace which it shares with gov- ernment agencies. Thus is history erased; and those decisions, which direct history into one course or another, are lost to the knowledge of the current gener- ation. 3.

On March 25, 1942, U.S. Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold announced that Wil- liam Stamps Farish (grandfather of the Presi- dent's money manager) had pleaded \"no con- test\" to charges of criminal conspiracy with the Nazis. Farish was the principal manager of a worldwide cartel between Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey and the I.G. Farben concern. The merged enterprise had opelied the Auschwitz slave labor camp on June 14.1940, to produce artificial rubber and gasoline from coal. The Hitler government supplied ! political. oppo- nents and Jews as the slaves, who were worked to near death and then murdered. Arnold disclosed that Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as Exxon), of which Farish was president and chief executive, had agreed to stop hiding from the United States patents for artificial rubber which the company had provided to the Nazis.' A Senate investigating committee under Sen- ator (later U.S. President)HanyTruman ofMis souri had called Arnold to testify at hearings on corporations' collaboration with the Nazis. The Senators expressed outrage at the cynical way Farish was continuing an alliance with the Hitler regime that had begun back in 1933, when Farish became chief of Jersey Standard.

Shell Oil is principally owned by the British : Royal family. Shell's chairman, Sir Henri De- , terding, helped sponsor Hitler's rise to power: by arrangement with the Royal Family's Bank of England Governor, Montagu Norman. Their ally, Standard Oil, would take part in the Hitler project right up to the bloody, gruesome end. When grandfather Farish signed the Jus- tice Department's consent decree in March 1942, the government had already started pick- ing its way through the tangled web of world- monopoly oil and chemical agreements be- tween Standard Oil and the Nazis. Many patents and other Nazi-owned aspects of the partner- ship had been seized by the U.S. Alien Property , custodian. Uncle Sam would not seize Prescott Bush's Union Banking Corporation for another seven months. The Bush-Farish axis had begun back in 1929. In that year, the Harriman bank bought Dresser Industries, supplier of oil-pipeline couplers to Standard and other companies.

The Congress proceedings were dedicated to Averell Harriman's mother; she had paid for the founding of the race-science movement in America back in 1910, building the Eugenics Record Office as a branch of the Galton Nation- al Laboratory in London. She and other Harri- mans were usually escorted to the horse races by old George Herbert Walker-they shared with the Bushes and the Farishes a fascination with \"breeding thoroughbreds\" among horses and humans.'' . Averell Harriman personally arranged with the WalkeriBush Hamburg-Amerika Line to transport Nazi ideologues from Germany to New York for this meeting.\" The most famous among those transported was Dr. Ernst Rudin, psychiatrist at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Genealogy and Demography in Berlin, where the Rockefeller family paid for Dr. Rudin to occupy an entire floor with his eugenics \"re search.\" Dr. Rudin had addressed the Interna- tional Federation's 1928 Munich meeting, speaking on \"Mental Aberration and Race Hy- giene,\" while others (Germans and Americans) spoke on race-mixing and sterilization of the unfit Rudin had led the German delegation to the 1930 Mental Hygiene Congress in Washing- ton, D.C. At the Harrimans' 1932 New York Eugenics Congress, Ernst Rudin was unanimously elect- ed President of the International Federation of Eugenics Societies. This was recognition of Rudin as founder of the German Society for Race Hygiene, with his co-founder, Eugenics Federation vice president Alfred Ploetz. As depression-maddened financiers 'sch6med in Berllbund New York, Rudtn'was now official leader of the world eugenics move- ment Components of his movement included groups with overlapping leadership, dedicated to: sterilization of mental patientsrmental hy- giene societies\"); execution of the insane, criminals and the terminally ill (\"euthanasia societies\"); and eugenical race-purification by prevention of births to parents from inferior blood stock (\"birth control societies\"). Before the Auschwitz death camp became a household word, these British-American-Euro- pean groups called openly for the elimination ofthe \"unfit\" by means including force and vio- lence.\" Ten months later, in June 1933, Hitler's inte- rior minister Wilhelm Frickspoke to a eugenics meeting in the new,Third Reich. Frick call6d the Germans a \"degenerate\" race, denouncing one-fifth of Germany's parents for producing \"feeble-minded\" and \"defective\" children. The following month, on a commission by Frick, Dr. Ernst Rudin wrote the \"Law for the Prevention of Hereditary Diseases in Posterity,\" the steril- ization law modeled on previous U.S. statutes in Virginia and other states. Special courts were soon established for the sterilization of German mental patients, the blind, the deaf, and alcoholics. A quarter mil- lion people in these categories were sterilized. Rudin, Ploetz, and their colleagues trained a whole generation of physicians and psychia- trists--as sterilizers and as killers. When the war started, the eugenicists, doc- tors, and psychiatrists staffed the new T4\" agency, which planned and supervised the mass killings: first at \"euthanasia centers,\" where the same categories which had first been subject to sterilization were now to be mur- dered. their brains sent in lots of 200 to experi- mental psychiatrists; then at slave camps such as Auschwitz; and finally, for Jews and 'other race victims, at straight extermination camps in Poland, such as Treblinka and Belsen.\" In 1933, as what Hitler called his \"New Order\" appeared, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. appointed William S. Farish the chairman of Standard Oil Ca. of New Jersey (in 1937 he was made presi- dent and chief executive). Farish moved his of- fices to Rockefeller Center, New York where he spent a good deal of time with Hermann Schmitz, chairman of I.G. Farben; his company paid a publicity man, Ivy Lee, to write pro-LC. Farben and pro-Nazi propaganda and get it into the U.S. press. Now that he was outside of Texas, Farish found himself in the shipping business-like the Bush family. He hired Nazi German crews for Standard Oil tankers. And he hired Emil Helfferich, chairman ofthe Walker/Bush/Harri- man Hamburg-Amerika Line, as chairman also of the Standard Oil Company subsidiary in Ger- many. Karl Lindemann, board member of Hamburg-Amerika, also became a top Farish- Standard executive in Germany.\" This interlock between their Nazi German operations put Farish together with Prescott Bush in a small, select group of men operating from abroad through Hitler's \"revolution,\" and calculating that they would never be punished. In 1939, Farish's daughter Martha married Averell Harriman's nephew, Edward Harriman Gerry, and Farish in-laws became Prescott Bush's partners at 59 Broadway.\""},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"Both Emil Helfferich and Karl Lindemann were authorized to write checks to Heinrich Himmler, chiefofthe Nazi SS, on a special Stan- dard Oil account. This account was managed by the German-British-American banker, Kurt von Schroeder. Accordingto U.S. intelligencedocu- ments reviewed by author Anthony Sutton, Hel- fferich continued his payments to the SS into 1944, when the SS was supervising the mass murder at the Standt&LGF~aAus&witz and other death camps:.Helfferlch tdld Allied interrogators after the war that these were not his personal contributions-they were corpo- rate Standard Oil funds.\" After pleading \"no contest\" to charges of criminal conspiracy with the Nazis,- William Stamps Farish was flned $5,000. (Similar fines were levied against Standard Oil--$5,000 each for the parent company and.for several subsidi- aries.) This of course did not interfere with the millions of dollars that Farish had acquired in conjunction with Hitler's New Order, as a large stockholder, chairman, and president of Stan- dard Oil. All the government sought was the use of patents which his company had given to the Nazis-the Auschwitz .patents-but had with- held from the U.S. military and industry. But a war was on, and if young men were to be asked to die fighting Hitler . . . something more was needed. Farish was hauled before the Senate committee investigating the national defense program. The committee chairman, Senator Harry Truman, told newsmen before Farish testified: \"I think this approaches treason.\"\" Farish began breaking apart at these hear- ings. He shouted his \"indignation\" at the sena- tors, and claimed he was not \"disloyal.\" After the March-April hearing ended, more dirt came gushing out of the Justice Depart- ment and the Congress on Farish and Standard Oil. Farish had deceived the U.S. Navy to pre- vent the Navy from acquiring certain patents, while supplying them to the Nazi war machine; meanwhile, he was supplying gasoline and tet- raethyl lead to Germany's submarines and air force. Communications between Standard and LC. Farben from the outbreak of World War I1 were released to the Senate, showing that Farish's organization had arranged to deceive the U.S. government into passing over Nazi- owned assets: They would aominally buy LG.'s share in certain patents because \"in the event of war between ourselves and Germany . . . it would certainly be very undesireable to have this 20 percent Standard-LC. pass to an alien property custodian of the U.S. who might sell it to an unfriendly interestwu John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (father of David. Nel- son, and John D. Rockefeller 1111, the control- ling owner of Standard Oil, told the Roosevelt administration that he knew nothing of the day- today affairs ofhis company, that all these mat- ters were handled by Farish and other execu- tives.\" In August, Farish was brought back for more testimony. He was now frequently accused of lying. Farish was crushed under the intense, public grilling; he became morose. ashen. While Prescott Bush escaped publicity when the government seized his Nazi banking organi- zation in October. Farish had been nailed. He collapsed and died of a heart attack on Novem- ber 29,1942 The Farish family was devastated by the ex- posure. Son William Stamps Farish, Jr., a lieu- tenant in the Army Air Force, was humiliated 'by the public knowledge that his father was fueling the enemy's aircrafl; he died in a train- ing accident in Texas six months later.\" With this double death, the fortune compris- ing much of Standard Oil's profits from Texas and Nazi Germany was now to be settled upon the little four-year-old grandson, William (\"Will\") Stamps Farish MI. Will Farish grew up a recluse, the most secretive multimillionaire in Texas, with investments of6'that money\" in.a multitude of foreign countries, and a host of exotic contacts overlapping the intelligence and financial worlds-particularly in Britain. The Bush-Farish axis started George Bush's career. After his 1948 graduation from Yale (and the Skull and Bones secret society), George Bush flew down to Texas on a corporate jet and was employed by his father's Dresser Indus- tries. In a couple of years he got help from his uncle, George Walker. Jr., and Farish's British banker friends, to set him up in the oil property speculation business. Soon thereafter, George Bush founded the Zapata Oil Company, which put oil drilling rigs into certain locations of great strategic interest to the Anglo-American intelligence community. Twenty-five-year-old Will Farish was person- al aide to Zapata chairman George Bush in Bush's unsuccessful 1964 campaign for Senate. Farish used \"that Auschwitz moneyn to back George Bush financially, investing in Zapata When Bush was elected to Congress in 1966, Farish joined the Zapata boad.ll When George Bush became U.S. vice presi- dent in 1980, the Farish and Bush!family for- tunes were again completely, secretly commin- gled. As we shall see. the old projects were now being revive$ on a breathtaking scale. Bush and Draper Twenty years before he was U.S. President, George Bush brought two \"race-sciencen pr+ fessors in front of the Republican Task Force on.Earth Resources and Population. As chair- man of the Task Force. then-Congressman Bush invited Professors William Shockley and Ar- thur Jensen to explain to the committee how allegedly runaway birth-rates for African- Americans were \"down-breeding1' the Ameri- can population. Afterwards. Bush personally summed up for thecongress the testimony his black-inferiority advocates had given to the Task Force.=George Bush held his hearings on the threat posed by black babies on August 5,1969, while much of the world was in a belter frame of mind-cele- brating mankind's progress from the first moon landing 16 days earlier. Bush's obsessive think- ing on this subject was uided by his family's If friend. Gen. William H. raper. Jr., the founder and chairman of the Population Crisis Commit- tee, and vice chairman of the Planned Parent- hood Federation. Draper had long been steer- ing U.S. public discussion about the so-called \"population bomb\" in the non-white areas of the world. If Congressman Bush had explained to his 0579"},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"colleagues how his jamily Id come to know Gen- em1 Draper, they would perhaps have felt some alarm, or even panic, and paid more healthy attention to Bush's presentation. Unfortu- nately, the Draper-Bush population doctrine is now official U.S. foreign policy. William H. Draper, Jr. had joined the Bush team in 1927, when he was hired by Dillon Read & Co., New York investment bankers. Draper was put into a new job slot at the firm: handling the Thyssen account We recall that in 1924, Fritz Thyssen set up . his Union Banking Corporation in George Her- bert Walker's bank at 39 Broadway, Manhattan. Dillon Read & Co.3 boss, Clarence Dillon, had begun working with Fritz Thyssen some time aRer Averell Harriman first met with Thys- sen-at about the timeThyssen began financing Adolf Hitler's political career. In January 1926, Dillon Read created the Ger- man Credit and Investmtt Corpomtion in New- ark, New Jersey and Berlin, Germany, as Thys- sen's short-term banker. That same year, Dillon Read created the Vereitrigte Stahlwerke (Ger- man Steel Trust), incorporating the Thyssen family interests under the direction of New York and London finance.= William H. Draper, Jr. was made director. vice president, and assistant treasurer of the . German Credit and Investment Corp. His busi- ness was short-term loans and financial man- agement tricks for Thyssen and the German Steel Trust Draper's clients sponsored Hitler's terroristic takeover; his clients led the buildup of the Nazi war induw. his clients made war against the United States. The Nazis were Drap er's direct partners in Berlin and New Jersey: Alexander Kreuter, residing in Berlin, was president; Frederic Brandi, whose father was a top coal executive in the German Steel Trust, moved to the United States in 1926 and served as Draper's co-director in Newark Draper's role was crucial for Dillon Read & Co., for whom Draper w2s a partner and eventu- ally vice president The German Credit and In- vestment Corp. (GCI) was a \"front\" for Dillon Read: It had the same New Jersey address as U.S. 6 International Securities Corp. (USIS), and the same man served as treasurer of both firms.\" , Clarence Dillon and hisson C. Douglas Dillon were directors of USIS; which was spotlighted when Clarence Dillon hauled before the Senate Banking Committee's famous \"Pecora\" hearings in 1933. USIS was shown to be one of the great speculative pyhmid schemes which had swindled stockholders of hundreds of mil- lions of dollars. These investment policies had rotte& the U.S. economy to the core, and led to the Great Depression of the 1930s. . , But William .H:'Draper, Jr.3 GCI \"frontn was not apparently afliliated with the USIS \"front\" or with Dillon, and the GCI escaped the con- gressmen's limited scrutiny. This oversight was to prove most unfortunate, particularly to the 50 million people who subsequently died in World; War 11. Dillon Read hired public relations man Ivy Lee to prepare their executives for their testi- mony and to confuse and further baMe the con- gressmen.= Lee apparently took enough time out from his duties as image-maker for William 0 5 S. Farish and the Nazi I.G. Farben Co.; he man- aged the congressional thinking so that the con- . ' gressmen did not disturb the Draper operation in Germany-and did not meddle with Thyssen, or interfere with Hitler's V.S. moneymen. Thus, in 1932, Willam H. Draper, Jr. was free to finance the International Eugenics Congress as a \"Supporting Member.\"= Was he using his own income as a Thyssen trust banker? Or did the funds come from Dfilon Read corporate ac- counts, perhaps to be wkitten oh income tax as \"expenses for ~ermafiproject: race purifica- tion\"? Draper helped select Ernst Rudin as chief of the world eugenics movement, who used his office to promoje what he called Adolf Hitler's \"holy, nationaland international racial hygienic mission.'4 W.S. Farish was pubicly exposed in 1942, hu- miliated and destroy . Just before Farish died. hescott Bush's f azi banking office was quietly seized and sh@ down: But Prescott's close friend and partn ' in the Thyssen-Hitler business, William H. $ raper, Jr., neither died w mowd out of Gemah 4ffcrits. Draper listed himself as a director of the German Credit and Investment Corp. through 1942, and the firm was not liquidated until November 1943.* But a war was on. Draper, a colddel from previous mili- tary service, went off b,the Pacific theater and became a general .: . ' - General.Draper apparently had a hobby; magic-illusions, sleight of hand, etc.-and he was a member of the Society of American Magi- cians. This is not irrelevant to his subsequent career. The Nazi regime surrendered in May 1945. In July 1945, General Draper was called to Europe by the American military government authori- ties in Germapy. Draper was appointed head of the Economics Division of the U.S; Control Commission. He was assigned to take apart the Nazi corporate cartels. There is an astonishing but perfectly logical rationale to this--Draper knew a lot about the subject! General Draper, who had spent about 15 years financing and managing the dirtiest of the Nazi enterprises; was now authorized to decide who was ezposed, who lost and who kept hii busines9'and in pmcti- cal effect, who was ptosecuted fot war crimes.\" (Draper.was not unique within the postwar occupation government Consider tpe case of Job' J.

Morgenthau demanded that Germany be utterly destroyed as a nation, that its industry be dis- mantled and it be reduced to a purely rural country. As the economic boss in 1945 and 1946, . Draper \"protected\" Germany from the Morgen- thau Plan . . . but at a price. Draper and his colleagues demanded that Germany and the world accept the collective 8 0 guilt ofthe Gewnan people as the explanation for"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"the rise of Hitler's New Order, and the Nazi war crimes. This, of course, was rather convenient for General Draper himself, as it was for the Bush family. It is still convenient decades later, allowing Prescott's son, President Bush, to lec- ture Germany on the danger of Hitlerism. Ger- mans are too slow, it seems, to accept his New World Order. Aner several years ofgovernment service (of- ten working directly for Averell Harriman in the North Atlantic Alliance), Draper was ap pointed in 1958 chairman of acommittee which was to advise President Dwight Eisenhower on the proper course for U.S. military aid to other countries. At that time, Prescott Bush was a U.S. senator from Connecticut, a confidential friend and golf partner with National Security Direc- tor Gordon Gray, and an important golf partner with Dwight Eisenhower as well. Prescott's old lawyer from the Nazi days, John Foster Dulles, was Secretary of State, and his brother Allen Dulles, formerly of the Schroder bank, was head of the CIA. This friendly environment emboldened our General Draper to pull off a stunt with his mili- tary aid advisery committee. He changed the subject under study. The following year, the Draper committee recommended that the U.S. government react to the supposed threat of the \"population explosion\" by formulating plans to depopulate the poorer countries. The growth of . the world's non-white population, he proposed, should be regarded as dangerous to the nation- al security of the United States!\" President Eisenhower rejected the recom- mendation. But in the next decade. General Draper founded the \"Population Crisis Com- mittee\" and the \"Draper Fund,\" joining with the Rockefeller and DuPont families to pre mote eugenics as \"population control.\" The ad- ministration of President Lyndon Johnson, ad- vised by Draper on the subject. began financing birth control in the tropical countries through the Agency for International Development General William Draper was George Bush's guru on the population question.\" But there was also Draper's money-from that uniquely horrible source-and Draper's connections on Wall Street and abroad. Draper's son and heir, William H. Draper 111, was co-chairman for fi- nance (chief of fundraising) of the Bush-for- president national campaign organization in 1980. With George Bush in the White House, the younger Draper heads up the depopulation activities of the United Nations throughout the world. Draper was vice president of Dillon Read un- til 1953. During the 1950s and 1960s. the chief executive there was Frederic Brandi, the Ger- man who was Draper's codirector for the Nazi investments and his personal contact man with the Nazi Steel Trust Nicholw Brady was Brandi's partner from 1954, and replaced him as the firm's chief executive in 1911. Nicholas Brady, who knows where all the bodies are bur- ied, was chairman of his friend George Bush's 1980 election campaign in New Jersey, and has been United States Treasury Secretary throughout Bush's presidenc~.~ Bush and Grey The U.S. Agency for International Develop ment (USAID) says that surgical sterilization is the Bush administration'sUfirst choice\" method of population reduction in the Third World.\" The United Nations Population Fund claims that 37 percent of contraception users in Ibero- America and the Caribbean have already been surgically sterilized. In a 1991 report, William H. Draper Ill's U.N. agency asserts that 2% mil- lion couples will be surgically sterilized over the course of the 1990s; and that if present trends continue, 80 percent of the women in Puerto Rico and Panama will besurgically ster- ilized.= .-- - he U.S. government pays directly for these sterilizations. Mexico is first among targeted nations. on a list which was drawn up in July 1991, at a USAID strategy session. India and Brazil are second and third priorities, respectively. On contract with the Bush administration, U.S. personnel are working ftom bases in Mexi- co to perform surgery on millions of Mexican men and women. The acknowledged strategy in this program is to sterilize those young adults who have not already completed their families. George Bush has a rather deep-seated per- sonal feeling about this project, iq particular as it pits him against Pope John Paul I1 in Catholic countries such as Mexico. (See Chapter4 below, on the origin of a Bush-family grudge in this regard.) The spending for birth control in the non- white countries is one of the few items that is headed upwards in the Bush administration budget As its 1992 budget was being set, USAID said its Population Account would receive $300 million, a 20 percent increase over the previous year. Within this project, a significant sum is spent on political and psychological manipula- tions of target nations, and rather blatant sub- version of their religions and govemmenkm These activities might be expected to cause serious objections from the victimized nation- alities, or from U.S. taxpayers, especially if the program is somehow given widespread pub- licity. Quite aside from moral considerations, legal questions would naturally arise, which could be summed up: How does George Bush think he can get away with this? In this matter the President has expert ad- vice. Mr. (Clayland) Boyden Gray has been counsel to George Bush since the 1980 election. As chief legal officer in the White House, Boy- den Gray can walk the President through the dangers and complexities of waging such un- usual warfare againstThird World populations. Gray knows how these things are done. When Boyden Gray was four and five years old. his father organized the pilot project for the present worldwide sterilization program, from the Gray family household in North Car- olina. It started in 1946. The eugenics movement was looking for a way to begin again in America."},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"0. - I. C.

The project in Orange County was conducted by the ' University of North Carolina and was financed by a 'Mr. Hanes,' a friend of Clarence Gamble and supporter of the field work project in North Carolina.

In 1950 and 1931, John Foster Dulles, then chairman of the Rockefellefi Foundation, led John D. Rockefeller 111 on a series of world tours, focusing on the need to stop the expan- sion of the non-white populations. In November 1952, Dulles and Rockefeller set up the Popula- tion Council, with tens of millions of dollars from the Rockefeller family. - At that poinf the American Eugenics Society, still cautious from the recent bad publicity vis- a-vis Hitler, left its old headquarters at Yale University: The Society moved its headquarters into the office of the Population Council, and the two groups meld& together.

The Gray family exwriment had succeeded. In 1988 the U.S. Agency for International De velopment signed its latest contract with the old Sterilization League (a.ka. \"Association for Voluntary Sterilization\"), committing the U.S. government to spend $80 million over five years. Having gotten away with sterilizing several hundred North Carolina school chiidren, \"not usually less than eight to ten years old,\" the identical group is now authorized by President Bush to do it to 58 countries in Asia, Africa, and Ibero-America. The group modestly claims it has directly sterilized only 2 million people, with 87 percent of the bill paid by U.S. tax- payers. Meanwhile, Dr. ~laience Gamble, Boyden Gray's favorite soap manufacturer, formed his own \"Pathfinder Fundn as a splitoff from the Sterlization League.

Only 22 and a half months before, the U.S. government had seized and shut down !he Union Banking Corporation, which had been operated on behalf of Nazi Ger- many by Bush and the Harrimans. But that was behind them now, and they were safe. There would be no publicity on the Harriman-Bush sponsorship of Hitlerism. Prescott's son George, the future U.S. Presi- dent, was also safe. Three days before this note to Moscow was written, George Bush had para- chuted from a Navy bomber airplane over the Pacific Ocean, kiliing his two crew members when the unpiloted plane crashed. Five months later, in February 1945..Pres- cott's boss Averell Harriman escorted Presi- dent Franklin Roosevelt to the fateful summit meeting with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at Yalta. In April Roosevelt died. The agreement reached at Yalta, calling for free elections in Poland once the war ended, was never en- forced. ....- Over the next eight years (1945 through 1952), Prescott Bush was Harriman's anchor in the New York financial world. The increasingly powerful Mr. Harriman and his allies gave East- em Eurdpe over to Soviet dictatorship. A Cold War was then undertaken, to \"counterbalance\" the Soviets. This British-inspired strategy paid several nightmarish dividends. Eastern Europe was to remain enslaved. Germany was \"permanently\" divided. Anglo-American power was jointly ex- ercised over the non-Soviet \"Free World.\" The confidential functions ofthe British and Ameri- can governments were merged. The Harriman clique tookpossession ofthe U.S. national secu- rity apparatus. and in doing so, they opened the gate and let the Bush family in. Following his services to Germany's Nazi Party, Averell Harriman spent several years mediat- ing between the British. American, and Soviet governments in the war to stop the Nazis. He was ambassador to Moscow from 1943 to 1946. President Harry Truman, whom Harriman and his friends held in amused contempt, ap pointed Harriman U.S. ambassador tb Britain in 1946."},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"Harriman was at lunch with former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill~cq&a~$ -~-1446,-wh'en~pRi33~~-.-.-. arrlman. asked Churchill if he should accept Truman's offer to come back to the U.S. as Secretary of Commerce. According to Harriman's account, Churchill told him: \"Absolutely. The center of power is in Washington.\"' Jupiter Island The reorganization of the American govern- ment affer World War 11-the creation of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency along British lines, for example--had devastating conse- quences. We are concerned here with only cer- tain aspects of that overall transformation, those matters of policy and family which gave shape to the life and mind of George Bush, and gave him access to power. It was in these postwar years that George Bush attended Yale niversity; and was induct- ed into the Skull Bones society. The Bush family's home at that time was in Greenwich, Connecticut But it just then that George's parents, Prescott Dorothy Walker Bush, childhood by his elderly mother Dorothy. She was said to be a resident of Hobe Sound, Flori- da. More precisely,: the President's mother lived in a hyper-security arrangement created a half-century earlief by Averell Harriman, ad- jacent to Hobe Sauna Its correct name is Jupi- I ter Island. During his politicalcareer, George Bush' has claimed many diffeent \"home* states, includ- ing Texas, Maine, Massachusetts, and Connecti- cut It has not been eqpedient for him to claim Florida. though that state has a vitil link to his role in the wirld, as Fe shall see. And George Bush's home base in Florida, throughout his adult life, has been Jupiter Island. The unique, bizarre setup on ~upitei~sland began in 1931, following the merger of W.A. Har- riman and Co. with the British-American firm Brown Brothers. ne reader will recall Mr. Samuel Pryor, the \"Merchant of Death.\"-A partner with the Harri- mans, Prescott Bush, George Walker, and Nazi boss Fritz Thyssen in banking and shipping en- terprises, Sam Pryor remained executive com- mittee ,chairman ,of Remington Arms. In this .pehod: the Nazi private armies (SA and SS) were supplied with American arms--most like- ly by Pryor and his company-as they moved to overthrow the German republic. Such gun- running as an instrument of national policy would later become notorious in the \"Iran-Con- tra\" affair. Sam Pryor's daughter Permelia married Yale graduate Joseph V. Reed on the last day of 1927. Reed immediately went to work for Prescott Bush and George Walker, as an apprentice at W.A. Hamman and Co. ' During World War 11, Joseph V. Reed had served in the \"special servicesw section of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. A specialist in security, codes and espionage, Reed later wrote a book entitled Fun loith ~syptogmm? 05 8 - -- George Bush on ~u$ter Island. Bush is wearing a boat racing uniform from his friend Don Aronow, front-man for gangster boss Meyer Lansky:The island lies just off the Florida coast, about 75 miles north of.Miami. Sam Pryor had had property around Hobe Sound, Florida, for some time. In 1931, Joseph and Permelia Pryor Reed bought the entirety of Jupiter Island. This is a typically beautiful Atlantic coast \"barrier island,\" a half-mile wide and nine miles long. The middle of Jupiter Island lies just off Hobe Sound. The south bridge connects the island with the town ofJupiter, to the north of Palm Beach. It is about 90 minutes by auto from Miami-today, a. few minutes by heli- . copter. Early in 1991, a newspaper reporter asked a friend of the Bush family about security ar- rangements on Jupiter Island. He responded, \"If you called up the White House, would they 8 tell you how many security people they had?"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"It's not that Jupiter Island is the White House, although he [Geoge Bush] does come dqvya,fre- ..quently.\" . * ' - But -for,*se~jp~ decada O~~~BUSII- .was . p~eqidelit;'Jl(l'iiterhlanh'h8h'an 6idinance re- quiring the registration and fingerprinting of all housekeepers, gardeners, and other non- residents working on the island. The Jupiter Island police department says that there are sensors in the two main roads that can track every automobile on the island. If a car stops in the street, the police will be there within one or two minutes. Surveillance is a duty of all employees of the Town of Jupiter Island. News reporters are to be prevented from visiting the island? To create this astonishing private club, Jo- seph and Permelia Pryor Reed sold land only to those who would fit in. Pennelia Reed was still the grande dame of the island when George Bush was inaugurated President in 1989. In rec- ognition of the fact that the Reeds know where aII the bodies are buried, President Bush ap pointed ~erm*elia's son, Joseph V. Reed, Jr., chief of protocol for the U.S. State Dept, in charge of private arrangements with foreign dignitaries. Averell Harriman made Jupiterlsland a stag- ing ground for his 1940s takeover of the U.S. national security apparatus. It was in that con- nection that the island became possibly the most secretive private place in America. Let us briefly survey the neighborhood, back then in 1946-48, to see some of the uses various of the residents had for the Harriman clique Residence on Jupiter . Island Jupiter Islander Robert A. La~ett,~, Prescott Bush's partner at Brown Brothers Hamman, had been Assistant Secretary of War for Air from 1941 to 1945. Lovett was the 1eadingAmeri- 058 can advocate of the policy of terror-bombing of civilians. He organized the Strategic Bombing Survey, camed out for the American and Brit- ish governments by the staff of the Prudential Insurance Company, guided by London's Tavis- tock Psychiatric Clinic. In the postwar period, Prescott Bush was as- sociated with Prudential Insurance, one of Lo- vett's intelligence channels to the British se- cret services. Prescott was listed by Prudential as a director ofthe company for about two years in the early 1950s. Their Strategic Bombing Survey failed to deponstrate any real military advantage accru- ing from such outrages as the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany. But the Hammanites nev- ertheless persisted in the advocacy of terror from the air. They glorified this as \"psychologi- cal warfare,\" a part of the utopian military doc- trine opposed to the views of military tradition- alists such as Gen. Douglas MacArthur. Robert Lovett later advised President Lyn- don Johnson to terror-bomb Vietnam. Presi- dent George Bush revived the doctrine with the bombing of civilian areas in Panama, and the destruction of Baghdad. On October 22,1945, Secretary of War Robert Patterson created the Lovett Committee, chaired by Robert A Lovett to advise the gov- ernment on the post-World War I1 organization of U.S. intelligence activities. The existence of this committee was unknown to the public until an official CIA history was released from secre- cy in 1989. But the CIA'S author (who was Presi- dent Bush's prep school history teacher; see chapter 5) gives no real details of the Lovett Committee's functioning, claiming: \"The re- cord of the testimony of the Lovett Committee, unfortunately, was not in the archives of the agency when this account was writtea*.

Lovett appeared before the Secretaries of State, War, and Navy on November 14,1945. He spoke highly of the FBI's work because it had \"the best personality file in the world.\" Lovett said the FBI was expert at producing false doc- uments, an art \"which we developed so success- fully during the.war and at which we became outstandingly adept\" Lovett pressed for a vir- tual resumption of the wartime Office of Strate- gic Services (OSS) in a new CIA. U.S. military traditionalists centered around Gen. Douglas MacArthur opposed Lovett's pro- posal. The continuation of the OSS had been . attacked at the end of the war on the grounds that the OSS was entirely under British control, and that it would constitute an American Gesta- po! But the CIA was established in 1947 ac- cording to the prescription of Robert Lovett, of Jupiter Island. a Charles Payson and his wife, Joan Whitney Payson, were extended family members of Har- riman's and business associates of the Bush family. Joan's aunt. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, was a relative of the Harrimans. Gertrude's son, Cornelius Vanderbilt (\"Sonny\") Whitney, long- time chairman of Pan American Airways (Pres- cott was a Pan Am director), became assistant secretary of the U.S. Air Force in 1947. Sonny's wife Marie had divorced him and mamed Aver- ell Hamman in 1930. Joan and Sonny's uncle, Air Marshal Sir Thomas Elmhirst, was director of intelligence for the British Air Force from 1945 to 1947. Joan's brother, John Hay (\"Jock\") Whitney, was to be ambassador to Great Britain from 1955 to 1961.. . when it would be vital for Pres- cott and George Bush to have such a friend. Joan's father, grandfather, and uncle were members of the Skull and Bones secret society. Charles Payson organized a uranium refinery in 1948. Later, he was chairman of Vitro Corpo- ration, makers of parts for submarine-launched ballistic missiles, equipment for frequency sur- veillance and torpedo guidance, and other sub. surface weaponry. Naval warfare has long been a preoccupation of the British Empire. British penetration of the'U.S. Naval Jntelligence service has been particularly heavy since the tenure of Joan's Anglophile grandfather, William C. Whitney, as secretary of the Navy for President Grover Cleveland. This traditional covert British ori- entation in the U.S. Navy, Naval Intelligence and the Navy's included service;the Marine Corps, forms a backdrop to the career of George Bush-and to the whole neighborhood on Jupi- ter Island. Naval Intelligence maintained di- rect relations with gangster boss Meyer Lansky for Anglo-American political operations i~ Cuba during World War 11, well before the es- tablishment of the CIA. Lansky officially moved to Florida in 1953.' .George Herbert 'Walker, Jr. (Skull and Bones, lm), was extremely close to his nephew George Bush, helping to sponsor his entry into the oil business in the 1950s. \"Uncle Herbie\" was also a partner of Joan Whitney Payson when they co-founded the New YorkMets base- ball team in 1960. His son, C.H. Walker 111, was a Yale classmate of Nicholas Brady and Moreau D. Brown (Thatcher Brown's grandson), forming what was called the \"Yale Mafia\" on Wall Street a WalkrS. Carpenter, Jr. had been chairman of the finance committee of the Du Pont Corpo- ration (1930-40). In 1933, Carpenter oversaw Du Pont's purchase of Remington Arms from Sam Pryor and the Rockefellers. and led Du Pont into partnership with the Nazi I.G. Farben com- pany for the manufacture of explosives. Car- penter became Du Pont's president in 1940. His cartel with the Nazis was broken up by the U.S. government. Nevertheless, Carpenter re- . mained Du Pont's president, as the company's technicians participated massively in the Man. hattan Projectto produce the first atomic bomb. He was chairman of Du Pont from 1948 to 1962, retaining high-level access to U.S. strategic ac- Yivities. 8 - -. Walter Carpenter and Prescott Bushwere fel- low activists in the Mental Hygiene Society.. 0riginating.at Yale University in 1908, the movement had been organized into the World Federation of Mental Health by Montague Nor- man, himself a fkequent mental patient, former: Brown Brothers partner and Bank of England Governor. Norman had appointed as the feder- ation's chairman, Brigadier John Rawlings Rees, director of the Tavistock Clinic, chief psy- chiatrist and psychological warfare expert for the British intelligence services. Prescott was a director ofthe society in Connecticut; Carpen- ter was a director in Delaware. a ha1 Mellon was the leading heir to the Mel- lon fortune, and a long-time neighbor ofAverell Hamman's in Middleburg, Virginia, as well as Jupiter Island, Florida. Paul's father, Andrew Mellon, U.S. treasury secretary 1921-32, had ap- proved the transactions of Harriman, Pryor, and Bush with the Warburgs and the Nazis. Paul Mellon's son-in-law, David K.E. Bnace, worked in Prescott Bush's W.k Harriman 6 Co. during the late 1920s; was head of the London branch of U.S. intelligence during World War 11; and was Averell Hamman's Assistant Secretary of Commerce in 19474. Mellon family money and participation would be instrumental in many domestic U.S. projects of the new Central Intel- ligence Agency.

We shall now briefly describe the forces that descended on Washington, D.C. during those years when Bush, with the assis- tance.of family and powerful friends, was be- coming \"established in business on his own.\" From 1048 to 1950, Prescott Bush's boss Aver- ell Hamman was U.S. rambassador-at-large\" to Europe. He was a non-military \"Theater Com- mander,\" the administrator of the multi-bil- liondollar Marshall Plan, participating in all militarylstrategic decision-making by the An- glo-American alliance. The U.S. secretary of defense, James Forres- tal, had become a problem to the Harrimanites. Forrestal had long been an executive at Dillon Read on Wall Street But in recent years he had gone astray. As secretary of the navy in 1944, Forrestal proposed the racial integration of the Navy. As defense secretary, he pressed for inte- gration in the armed fies and this eventually became the U.S. policy. Forrestal opposed..the utopians' strategy of appeasement coupled, with brinkmanship. He was simply opposed to.communism. On March' 28,194@, Forrestal was forced out of office and flown on an Air Force plane to Florida He was taken to \"Hobe Sound\" (Jupiter Island), where Robert Zovett and an army psychiatrist dealt with him.' He was flown back to Washington, locked in Walter Reed Anny Hospital and given insulin shock treatments for alleged \"mental exhaus- tion.\" He was denied all visitors except his es- tranged wife and children-his son had been Averell Harriman's aide in Moscow. On May 22. Forrestal's body was found, his bathrobe cord tied tightly around bis neck, aner he had plunged Prom a sixwnth-story hospital. win- dow.

Clifford, how- ever, remained close to Harriman and his part- ners as they gained more and more power. Clif- ford later wrote.about his cordial relations with Prescott Bush: \"Prescott Bush.. . had become one of my fre- quent golfing partners in the fifties, and I had both lilted and respected him. . . .

George C. Marshall as secretary of defense. At the same time, Prescott's partner, Robert hvett, himself became assistant secre- tary of defense. ' Lovett, Marshall, Harriman, and Acheson went to work to unhorse Cen. Douglas MacAr- thur, commander of U.S. forces in Asia. MacAr- thur kept Wall Street's intelligence agencies away from his command, and favored real inde- pendence for the non-white nations. Lovett called for MacArthur's firing on March 23,1951, citing MacArthur's insistence on defeating the Communist Chinese invaders in Korea. MacAr- thur's famous message, that there was \"no sub- stitute for victory,\" was read in Congress on April 5; MacArthur was fired on April 10,1951. That September, Robert Lovett replaced Marshall as secretary of defense. Meanwhile. Harriman was named director of the Mutual SecuritynAgency, making him the U.S. chief of the Anglo-American military alliance. By now, Brown Brothers Harriman was everything but commander-in-chief. These were, of course, exciting times for the Bush family, whose wagon was hitched to the financial gods of Olympus-to Jupiter, that is. Brown Brothers Harriman 6 Co. 59 Wall Street, New York 5, N.Y.

With affectionate regard, I am, Sincerely yours, Pres [signed] Prescott S. Bush A central focus of the Harriman security re- gime in Washington (1950-53) was the organiza- tion ok covert operations, and \"psychological warfare.\" Harriman, together with his lawyers and business partners, Allen and John Foster Dulles, wanted the government's secret servic- es to conduct extensive propaganda campaigns and mass-psychology experiments within the U.S.A, and paramilitary campaigns abroad. This would supposedly ensure a stable world- wide environment favorable to Anglo-Ameri- can financial and political interests. The Harriman security regime created the Defense Secretary .Jibes Fonestal. Formerly with Dillon Read. he opposed tfib Harrimanites' condominium with the U.S.S.R., and racially integrated U.S. armed forces. He was fired and flown to Jupiter Island, where he was \"suicided.\" Psychological Strategy Board (PSB) in 1951. The man appointed director of the PSB, Cordon Gray, is familiar to the reader as the spoasor of the child sterilization experiments, carried out by the Hammanite eugenics movement in North Carolina following World War 11. Gordon Cray was an avid Anglophile, whose father had gotten controlling ownership of the RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company through alli- ance with the British Imperial tobacco cartel's U.S. representatives, the Duke family of North Carolina. Cordon's brother, FLJ. Reynolds chairman Bowman Cray Jr., was also a naval intelligence officer, known around Washington as the \"founder of operational intelligence.\" Cordon Cray became a close friend and politi- cal ally ofPrescott Bush; and Gray's son became for Prescott's son, George, his lawyer and the shield of his covert policy. But President Harry Truman, as malleable as he was, constituted an obstacle to the covert warriors. An insular Missouri politisian vague- ly favorable to the U.S. Constitution, he re- mained skeptical about secret service activi- ties that reminded him of the Nazi Gestapo. So, \"covert operationsn could not fully take off without a change of the Washington regime. And it was with the Republican Party that Pres- cott Bush was to get his turn.

('The race was actually for a two-year unexpired term, left empty by the death of the previous senator). In those days, Wisconsin's drunken Senator Joseph R McCarthy was making a circus-like crusade against communist influence in Wash- ington. McCarthy attacked liberals and leftists, State Department personnel, politicians, and Hollywood figures. He generally left unscathed the Wall Street and London strategists who do- nated Eastern Europe and China to communist dictatorshiplike George Bush, their geopoli- tics was beyond left and right Prescott Bush had no public ties to the notori- ous Joe McCarthy, and appeared to be neutral about his crusade. But the Wisconsin senator had his uses. Joe McCarthy came into Connecti- cut three times.that year to campaign for Bush and against the Democrats. Bush himself made charges of \"Korea, Communism and Cormp tion\" into a slick campaign phrase against Ben- ton, which then turned up as a national Repub- lican slogan. The response was disappointing. Only small crowds turned out to hear Joe McCarthy, and Benton was not hurt McCarthy's prelush rally in New Haven, in a hall that seated 6,000, drew . only 376 people.

At that time, the old Hamman eugenics movement was centered at Yale Uni- versity. Prescott Bush was a Yale trustee, and his former Brown Brothers Hamman partner, Lawrence Tighe, was Yale's treasurer. In that connection, a slight glimmer of the truth about the Bush-Hamiman firm's Nazi activities now made its way into the campaign. Not only was the American Eugenics Society itself headquartered at Yale, but all parts of this undead fascist movement had a busy home at Yale. The coercive psychiatry and steriliza- tion advocates had made the Yale/New Haven Hospital and Yale Medical School their labora- tories for hands-od practice in brain surgery and psychological experimentation. And the Birth Conttol League was there, which had long trumpeted the need for eugenical births--few- er births for parents with \"inferior\" bloodlines Prescott's partner Tighe was a Connecticut di- rector of the league, and the Connecticut league's medical advisor was the eugenics ad- vocate, Dr. Wintenitz of Yale Medical School. Now in 1950, people who knew something about Prescott Bush knew that he had very un- savory roots in the eugenics movement There were then, just atter the anti-Hitler war, few open advocates of sterilization of unfitn or \"un- necessary\" people. (That would be revived lat- er, with the help of General Draper and .his friend George Bush.) But the Birth Control League was public-just about then it was changing its name to the euphemistic \"Planned Parenthood.\" Then, very late in the 1950 senatorial can;- paign. Prescott Bush was publicly exposed for being an activist in that section of the old fascist eugenics movement. Prescott Bush lost the election by about 1,000 out of E62,000 votes. He and his family blamed the defeat on the expose. The defeat was buned into the family's memo- ry. leaving a bitterness and perhaps a desire for revenge. In his foreword to a population control pro- paganda book, George Bush wrote about that 1950 election: \"My own first awareness of birth control as a public policy issue came with a jolt in 1950 when my father was running for United States Senate in Connecticut Drew Pearson, on the Sunday before Election day, 'revealed' that my father was involved with Planned Par- enthod. . . . Many political observers felt a suf- ficient number of voters were swayed by his alleged contacts with the birth' controllers to cost him the election. . . .\"I1 Prescott Bush gave a graphic description of these events in his \"oral history\" interview at Columbia University: \"In the 1950 campaign, when I ran against Benton, the very last week, Drew Pearson, famous columnist, was running a radio program at that time.. . . In this particu- lar broadcast, just at the end of our campaign [Pearson said]: \"I predict that Benton will re- tain his seat in the United States Senate, be- cause it has just been made known that Rescott Bush, his opponent, is president of the Birth Control Society\" or chairman, member of the board of directors, or something, \"of the Birth Control Society. In this country, and of course with Connecticut's heavy Catholic population, and its laws against birth control : . . this is go- ing to be too much for Bush to rise above. Ben. ton will be elected. I predict\" The next Sunday, they handed out, at these Catholic Churches in Waterbury and Torring- ton and Bridgeport, handbills, quoting Drew Pearson's statement on the radio about Pres- cott Bush, you see--I predict Well, my tele- phone started ringing that Sunday at home, and when I'd answer, or Dotty [Prescott's wife, George's mother] would answer-\"Is this true, what they say about Prescott Bush? This can't be true. Is it true?\" She'd say, \"No, it isn't true.\" Of course, it wasn't true. But you never catch up with a thing like this--the election's just day after tomor- row, you see? So there's no doubt, in the esti- mate of our political leaders, that this one thing cost me many thousand votes--whether it was 1.3.5 or 10 thousand we don't know, we can't possibly tell, but it was enough.

They fought repeal every time it came up in the legislature, and we never did get nd of that prohibition until just a year or two ago, as I recall it [emphasis added].'' Prescott Bush was defeated, while the other Republican candidates fared well in Connecti- cut. He attributed his loss to the Catholic Church. Aner all, he had dependable friends in the news media. The New Yotk Times loved him for his bland pleasantness. He just about owned CBS. Twenty years earlier, Prescott Bush had personally organized the credit to, allow William S. Paley to buy the CBS (radio. later television) network outright In return, Prescott was made a director and the financial leader of CBS; Paley himself became a devoted follower and servitor of Averell Hamman. Well; when he tried again, Prescott Bush would not leave the outcome to the blind whims of the public. Prescott Bush moved into action in 1952 as a national leader of the push to give the Republi- can presidential nomination to Gen. Dwight D. (\"Ike\") Eisenhower. Among the other team members were Bush's Hitler-era lawyer John Foster Dulles, and Jupiter Islander C. Douglas Dillon. Dillon and his father were the pivots as the Harriman-Dulles combination readied Ike for the presidency. As a friend put it: \"When the Dillons . . . invited IEisenhower] to dinner it was to introduce him to Wall Street bankers and lawyers.\"\" Ike's higher level backers believed, correct- ly, that Ike would not interfere with even the dirtiest of their covert action programs. The bland, pleasant Prescott Bush was'in from the beginning: a friend to Ike, and an original back- er of his presidency. On July 28,1952, as the election approached, Connecticut's senior U.S. senator, James O'Bri- en McMahon, died at the age of 48. (McMahon had been Assistant B.S. Attorney General, in charge of the Criminal Division, from 1935 to 1939. Was there a chance he might someday speak out about the unpunished Nazi-era crimes of the wealthy and powerful?) This was mremely convenient for Prescott He got the Republican nomination for U.S. sen- ator at a special delegated meeting, with back- ing by the Yale-dominated state party leader- ship. Now he would run in a special election for the suddenly vacant Senate seat He could expect to be swept into office, since he would be on the same electoral ticket as the popular war hero, General Ike. By a technicality, he would instantly become Connecticut's senior senator, with extra power in Congress. And the next regularly scheduled senatorial race would be in 1956 (when McMahon's ten would have ended), so Prescott could run again in that pres- ' idential election year . . . once again on Ike's coattails! With this arrangement, things worked out very smoothly. In Eisenhower's 1952 election tictory, Ike won Connecticut by a margin of 129,507 votes out of 1,092,471. Prescott Bush came in last among the statewide Republicans, but managed to win by 30,373 out of 1,088,799, his margin nearly 100,000 behind Eisenhower. He took the traditionally Republican towns. 05 9 In Eisenhower's 1956 re-election, Ike won Connecticut by 303,036outof l,114,954votes, the largest presidential margin in Connecticut's history. Prescott Bush managed to win again. by 129,544votes out of 1,085,206-his margin this time 290,082 smaller than Eisenhower's.\" In January 1963, when this electoral strategy had been played out and his second term ex- pired, Prescott Bush retired from government and returned to Brown Brothers Harriman. The 1952 Eisenhower victory made John Fos- ter Dulles Secretary of State, and his brother Allen Dulles head of the CIA The reigning Dul- les brothers were the \"Republican\" replace- ments for their client and business partner, \"Democrat\" Averell Harriman. Occasional pub- lic posturings aside, their strategic commit- ments were identical to his. . Undoubtedly the most important work ac- complished by Prescott Bush in the new regime was on the golf links. I Those who remember the Eisenhower presi- dency know that Ike played . . . quite a bit of golf! Democrats sneered at him for mindless- ness, Republicans defended him for taking this healthy recreation. Golf was Ike's ruling pas- sion. And there at his side was the loyal, bland, pleasant Senator Prescott Bush, former presi- dent of the U.S. Golf Association, son-in-law of the very man who had reformulated the rules of the game. Prescott Bush was Dwight Eisenhower's fa- vorite golf partner. Preseott could reassure Ike about his counselors, allay his concerns, and monitor his moods. Ike was very grateful to Prescott, who never revealed the President's scores. The public image of his relationship to the President may be gleaned from a 1956 newspa- per profile of Prescott Bush's role in the party. The New York Times, which 11 years before had consciously protected him from public expo- sure as a Nazi banker. fawned over him in an article entitled, \"His Platform: Eisenhowern?\"' tall, lean. well-dressed man who looks exactly like what he is--a wealthy product of the Ivy League-is chairman of the Republican Con- vention's platform committee. As such, Rescott Bush, Connecticut's senior United States Sena- tor, has a difficult task: he has to take one word and expand it to about 5,000. \"The one word, of course, is '1ke'-but no par- ty platform could ever be so simple and direct 0..

BY diligent research. his views 1 on some issues-may be traced: He was opposed to the development of public power projects like the Tennessee Valley Authority; he opposed the constitutional amendment in- troduced by Ohio Senator John W. Bricker, which would have required congressional ag proval of international agreements by the exec- utive branch. But Prescott Bush was essentially a covert operative in Washington. In June 1954, Bush received a letter from Con- necticut resident H. Smith Richardson, owner of Vick Chemical Company (cough drops, Vapo- Rubli It read, in part, \". . .

The Bush family knew Richardson and his wife through their mutual friendship with Sears Roebuck's chairman, General Robert E. Wood. General Wood had been president of the America First organization, which had lobbied against war with Hitler's Germany. H. Smith Richardson had contributed the start-up money for America First and had spoken out against the United States \"joining the Communists\" by fighting Hitler. Richardson's wife was a proud relative of Nancy Langehorne from Virginia, who married Lord Astor and backed the Nazis from their Cliveden Estate. General Wood's daughter Mary had married the son of Standard Oil president William Stamps Farish. The Bushes had stuck with the Farishes through their disastrous exposure during World War U (See Chapter 3). Young George Bush and his bride Barbara were espe- cially close to Mary Farish, and to her son W.S.

He was running in this election for a full term, at the same time that Prescott Bush was running to fill the seat left vacant by Senator McMahon's death).\" The H. Smith Richardson Foundation was or- ganized by Eugene Stetson, Jr., Richardson's son-in-law. Stetson (Skull and Bones, 1934) had worked for Prescott Bush as assistant manager ofthe New York branch ofBrown Brothers Har- riman. In the late 1950s, the Smith Richardson Foun- dation took part in the upsychological warfaren of the CIA. This was not a foreign, but a domes- tic covert operation, carried out mainly against unwitting U.S. citizens. CIA director Allen Dul- les and his Britishallies organized \"MK-Ultra,\" the testing of psychotropic drugs including LSD , on a very large scale, allegedly to evaluate \"chemical warfaren possibilities. In this period. the Richardson Foundation helped finance experiments at Bridgewater Hospital in Massachusetts, the center of some ofthe most brutal MK-Ultra tortures. These out- rages have been graphically portrayed in the movie, Titticut Fok. During 1990, an investigator for this book toured H.

The Smith Richardson Foundation will be seen in a later chapter, performing in the Iran- Contra drama around Vice President George Bush. * * * Prescott Bush worked throughout the Eisen- hower years as a confidential ally of the Dulles brothers. In July 1956, Egypt's President Camel Abdul Nasser announced he would accept the U.S. offer of a loan for the construction of the Aswan dam project John Foster Dulles then prepared a statement telling the Egyptian am- bassador that the U.S.A had decided to retract its offer. Dulles gave the explosive statement in advance to Prescott Bush for his approval. Dulles also gave the statement to President Ei- senhower, and to the British government Nasser reacted to the Dulles brush-off by na- tionalizing the Suez Canal to pay for the dam. Israel, then Britain and France, invaded Egypt to try to overthrow Nasser, leader of the anti- imperial Arab nationalists. However, Eisen- 0596 hower refused (for once) to play the Dulles-Brit- ish game, and the invaders had to leave Egypt when Britain was threatened with U.S. econom- ic sanctions. . During 1956, Senator Prescott Bush's va'lue to the Harriman-Dulles political group increased when he was put on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Bush toured U.S. and allied mili- tary bases throughout the world, and had in- creased access to the national security deci- sion-making process. In the later years of the Eisenhower presi- dency, Gordon Gray rejoined the government As an intimate friend and golfing partner of Prescott Bush, Gray complemented the Bush influence on Ike. The Bush-Gray family partner- ship in the \"secret governmentn continues up through the George Bush presidency. Gordon Gray had been appointed head of the new Psychological Strategy Board in 1951 un- der Averell Harriman's rule as assistant to President Truman for national security affairs. From 1958 to lMl Gordon Gray held the identi- cal post under President Eisenhower. Gray act- ed as Ike's intermediary, strategist and hand- holder, in the President's relations with the CIA and the U.S. and allied military forces. Eisenhower did not oppose the CIA'S covert action projects; he only wanted to be protected from the consequences of their failure or expo- sure. Gray's primary task, in the guise of \"over- sight\" on all U.S. covert action, was to protect and hide the growing mass of CIA and related secret government activities. It was not only covert pmjec!s which were de- veloped by the Gray-Bush-Dulles combination; it was also new, hidden stmctum of the United States government Senator Henry Jackson challenged these ar- rangements in 1959 and 1960. Jackson created a Subcommittee on National Policy Machinery of the Senate Committee on Governmental Op erations, which investigated Gordon Gray's reign at the National Security Council.

The center came to be directed by Frank Barnett, former program of- ficer of the Bush family's Smith Richardson Foundation. The center conduited funds to the London-based Forum World Features, for the circulation of CIA-authored \"news stories\" to some 300 newspapers internationally?' \"Democrat\" Averell Hamman rotated back into official government in the Kennedy admin- istration. As assistant secretary and undersec- retary of state, Harriman helped push the Unit- ed States into the Vietnam War. Harriman had no post in the Eisenhower administration. Yet he was perhaps more than anyone the leader and the glue for the incredible evil that was hatched by the CIA in-the final Eisenhower mrs: a half-public,-half-ptimte.IIarrimmite \" army, never since demobilized, and incasing- ly associated with the name of Bush. 0 Following the rise of Castro, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency contracted with the orga- nization ofMafia boss Meyer Lansky toorganize and train assassination squads for use against the Cuban government. Among those employed were John Rosselli, Santos Trafficante, and Sam Ciancana. Uncontested public documenta- tion of these facts has been published by con- gressional bodies and by leading Establish- ment academics.= But the disturbing implications and later consequences of this engagement are a crucial matter for further study by the citizens of every nation. This much is established: On August 18,1M, President Eisenhoweraij- proved a $13 million omcia1 budget for a secret CIA-run guerrilla war agaipst Castm. It\"& known that Vice President Richard P Nixen took a handin the promotion of this initiative. The U.S. inilitary was kept out of the covert action plans until very late in the game. The first of eight admitted assassination at- tempts against Castro took place in 1060. The program was, of course, a failure, if not a circus. The invasion of Cuba by the CIA'S anti- Cash exiles was put off until after John Ken- nedy took over the presidency. As is well known, Kennedy balked at sending in U.S. air cover and Cash's forces easily prevailed. But the progam continued.

Howard Hunt. Their overall CIA boss was Miami station chief Theodore G. Shackley, seconded by Thomas Clines. In later chapters we will follow the subsequent careers of these characters-increasingly identified with George Bush-through the Kennedy assas- sination, the Watergate coup, and the Iran-Con- tra scandal. 5 The Silver Spoon George Herbert Walker Bush was born in Mil- ton, Massachusetts, on June l2,1924. Duringthe next year the family moved to Greenwich, Con- necticut, and established their permanent psi- dency. Prescott and Dorothy Walker Bush had had a son, Prescott, Jr., before George. Later there was a little sister, Nancy, and another brother, Jonathan; a fourth son, William C'Bucky\"), was born 14 years after George, in 1939. George was named after his grandfather, George Herbert Walker. Since George's mother called Grandfather Walker \"Pop,\" she began calling her son, his namesake, \"little Pop,\" or \"Poppy.\" Hence, Poppy Bush is the name the President's family friends have called him since his youth. Prescott, Sr. joined W.A. Harriman 6 Co. May 1,1926. With his family's lucrative totalitarian projects, George Bush's childhood began in comfort and advanced dramatically to Luxury and elegance. The Bushes had a large, dark-shingled house with \"broad verandas and a portecochere\" (originally a roofed structure extending out to the driveway to protect the gentry who amved in coaches) on Grove Lane in the Deer Park 7"},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":"section of Greenwich.! Here they were attended by four servants-- three maids, one of whom cooked, and a chauffeur. The U.S.A was plunged into the Great De- pression beginning with the 1929-31 financial collapse. But George Bush and his family were totally insulated from this crisis. Before and after the crash, their lives were a frolic, sealed off from the concerns of the population at large. During the summers, the Bushes stayed in a second home on the family's ten-acre spread at Walker's Point at Kennebunkport. Maine. Flush from the Soviet oil dealsand theThyssen- Nazi Party arrangements, Grandfather Walker had built a house there for Prescott and Doro- thy. xhey and,pthw yell-to-do summer ~olo- di& used &ennebunkport's River Club for ten': nis and the club's yachting facilities. In the winter season, they took the train to Grandfather Walker's plantation, called \"Dun- cannon,\" near Barnwell, South Carolina The novices were instructed in skeet shooting, then went out on horseback, following the hounds in pursuit of quail and dove. George's sister Nancy recalled \"the care takenn by the servants \"over the slightest things, like the trimmed edges of the grapefruit We were waited on by the most wonderful black servants who woul'd come into . the bedrooms early-in the morning and light those crackling pinewood fires. . . .* The money poured in from the Hamburg-Am- erih steamship line, its workforce crisply reg- ulated by the Nazi Labor Front The family took yet another house at Aiken, South Carolina There the Bush children had socially accept- able \"tennis and riding partners. Aiken was a southern capital of polo in those days, a winter resort of considerable distinction and serenity that attracted many Northerners, especially the equestrian oriented. The Bush children naturally rode there, too. . . .* Averell Ham- man, a worldclass polo player, also frequented Aiken. Poppy Bush's father and mother anxiously promoted the family's distinguished lineage, and its growing importance in the world. Pres- cott Bush claimed that he \"could trace his fami- ly's roots backto England's King Henry III, mak- ing George a thirteenth cousin, twice removed of Queen Elizabeth.\"' This particular conceit may be a bad omen for President Bush. The cowardly, acjd-tdmed Henrg wafdef&i~~ncets;&uiilXa (Saint Louis) in Henry's grab for power over France and much of Europe. Henry's own bar- ons at length revolted against his blundering arrogance, and his power was curbed. As the 1930s economic crisis deepened, Americans experienced unprecedented hard- ship and fear. The Bush children were taught that those who suffered these problems had no one to blame but themselves. A hack writer, hired to puff President Bush's \"heroic military background,\" wrote these lines Erom material supplied by the White House: \"Rescott Bush was a thrifty man.. . He had no sympathy for the qouveau riches who flaunted their wealth-they were without claw, he said. As a sage and strictly honest business- man, he had often turned failing companies around, making them profitable again, and he 0 \"As the 1930s economic crisis deepened, Americans experienced unprecedeited hardshiv and fear. The Bush children were taht that those who suffixed these problems had no one to blame but themselves.\" had scorn for people who went bankrupt be- cause they mismanaged their money. Prescott's lessons were absorbed by young George. . . .* When he reached the age of five, George Bush joined his older brother Pres in attending the Greenwich Country Day School. The brothers' \"lives were charted from birth. Their fatherhad determined that his sons would be. . . educated , and trained to be members of America's elite. . . . Greenwich Country Day School [was] an ex- clusive all-male academy for youngsters slated for private secondary schools. . . . \"Alec, the family chauffeur, drove the two boys to school every morning after dropping Wcott, Sr. at the railroad station for the morning commute to Manhattan The Depres- sion was nowhere in evidence as the boys glid- ed in the family's black Oldsmobile past the stone fences, stables, and swimming pools of one' of the wealthiyt communities in America.\"' ' . But though the young George Bush had no concerns about his material existence, one must not overlook the important, private anxi- ety gnawing at him from the direction of his mother. The President's wife, Barbara, has put most succinctly the question of Dorothy Bush and her effect on George: \"His mother was the most competitive living human.\" If we look here in his mother's shadow, we may find something beyond the routine medical explanations for President Bush's \"driven\" states of rage, or hyperactivity. Mother Bush was the best athlete in the fami- ly, the fastest runner. She was hard. She expect- ed others to be hard. They must win, but they must always appear not to care about winning. This is put politely, delicately, in a \"biogra- phy\" written by an admiring friend of the Presi- dent: \"She was with them day after day,. . .often curbing their egos as only a marine drill in- structor can. Once when.. . George lost a tennis match, he explained to her that he had been off his game that morning. She retorted, 'You don't have a game.' \"' According to this account, Barbara was fasci- nated by her mother-in-law's continuing feroci- ty: \"George, playing mixed doubles with Barba- ra on the Kennebunkport court, ran into a porch and injured his right shoulder blade. 'His moth- er said it was my ball to hit, and it happened because I didn't run for it She was probably right,' Barbara told [an interviewer]. .,. .

A goad to mprd motion became embedded in his personality. It is observable throughout George Bush's life. A companion trait was Poppy's uncanny urge, his master obsession with the need to \"kiss up,\" to propitiate those who might in any way ad- vance his interests. A life of such efforts could at some point reach a climax of released rage, where the triumphant one may Enally say, \"Now it is only I who must be feared.\" This dangerous cycle began very early, a re- sponse to his mother's prodding and intimida- tion; it intensified as George became more able to calculate his advantage. His mother says: \"George was a most un- selfish child When he was only a little more than two years old . . . we bought him one of those pedal cars you climb into and work with your feet \"[His brother] Pres knew just how to work it, and George came running over and grabbed the wheel and told Pres he should 'have half,' meaning half of his new posession. 'Have half, have half,' he kept repeating, and for a while around the house we called him 'Have halt' \"lo George \"learned to ask for no more than what was due him. Although not the school's leading student, his report card was always good, and his mother was particularly pleased that he was always graded 'excellent' in one category she thought of great importance: 'Claims no more than his fair share of time and attention.' This consistent ranking led to a little family joke- George always did best in 'Claims no more.' \"He was not a selfish child, did not even dis- play the innocent possessiveness common to most children. . . .\"I1 At Andover Geoke Bush leR Greenwich Country Day School in 1936. He joined his older brother at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, 20 milesaorth of Boston. \"Poppy\" was 12 years old, handsome, and rich. Though the U.S. econ- omy took a savage turn for the wope the follow- ing year, George's father was piling up a for- tune, arranging bond swindles for the Nazis with John Foster Dulles. Only about one in 14 U.S. secondary school students could afford to be in private schools during George Bush's stay at Andover (1936-42). The New England preparatory or \"prep\" schools were the most exclusive. Their students were almost all rich white boys, many of them Episcopalians. And Andover was, in certain strange ways, the most exclusive of them all. A 1980 campaign biography prepared by Bush's own staff concedes that \"it was to New England that they returned to be educated at select schools that produce leaders with a pa- trician or aristocratic stampadjectives, inci- dentally, which cause a collective wince among the Bushes .. .At the close of the 1930s.. .these schools . . ::brought the famous 'old-boy net- works' to th6peak oftheir po~er.\"~ ' These American institutions have been con-\" sciously modeled on England's. elite private, AUV house, George Bush's se- cret society at Andowr prep school, where death, sadism. and humiliation were celebrat- ed.

The philosophy inculcated into the son of a British Inrd Admiral or South African police chief, was to be imbibed by sons of the American republic. . George made some decisive moral choices about himself in these first years away from home. The institution which guided these choices, and helped shape the peculiar obses- sions of the 41st President, was a pit of Anglo- phile aristocratic racialism when George Bush came on the scene. \"Andover was . . . less dedicated to 'elitism' than some [schools]. . . .There were even a cou- ple of blacks in the classes, tokens of course, but this at a time when a blackstudent at almost any other Northeastern prep school would have been ~nthinkabla\"~ Andover had avaunted \"tradition,\" intermin- gled with the proud bloodlines of its students and alumni, that was supposed to reach back to the school's founding in 1778. But a closer examination reveals this \"traditionn to be a fraud It is part of a larger, highly significant historical fallacy perpetrated by the Anglo- Americans-and curiously stressed by Bush's agents in foreign countries."},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"Thomas Cochran, a partner ofthe J.P. Morgan banking firm, donated considerable sums to construct swanky new Andover buildings in the 1920s. Among these were George Washington Hall and Paul Revere Hall, named for leaders of the American Revolution against the British Empire. These and similar \"patrioticn trap pings, with the allumni's old school-affiliated genealogies, might seem to indicate an unbro- ken line of racial imperialists like Cochran and his circle, reaching back to the heroes of the Revolution! Let us briefly tour Andover's history, and then ponder whether General Washington would want to be identified with Poppy Bush's school. Thirty years alter Samuel Phillips founded the Academy at Andover, Massachusetts, the quiet little school became embroiled in a vio- lent controversy. On one side were certain die- hard pro-British families, known as Boston Brahmins, who had prospered in the ship trans- portation of rum and black slaves. They had regained power in Boston since their allies had lost the 177543 Revolutionary War. In 1805 these cynical, neo-pagan, Tory\" fami- lies succeeded in placing their representative in the Hollis chair of Philosophy at Harvard College. The Tories. parading publicly as liber- al religionists called Unitarians, were opposed by American nationalists led by the geogra- pher-historian RevaaJedidiah Morse (1761-1826). The nationalists rallied the Christian churches of the northeastern states behind a plan to es- tablish, at Andover, a new religious institution which would counter the British spies, atheists, and criminals who had taken.over Harvard. British Empire political operatives Stephen Higginson, Jr. and John Lowell, Jr. published counterattacks against Rev. Morse, claiming he was trying to rouse the lower classes of citizens to hatred against the wealthy merchant fami- lies. Then the Tories played the \"conservativen card. Ultra-orthodox Calvinists, actually busi- ness partners to the Harvard liberals, threat- ened to set up their own religious institution in Torydominated Newburyport Their assertion, that Morse was not conservative enough, split the resources of the region's Christians, until the Morse group reluctantly brought the New- buryport ultras as partners into the manage- ment of the Andover Theological Seminary in 1808. The new theological seminary and the adja- cent boys' academy were now governed togeth- er under a common board of trustees (balanced between the Morse nationalists and the Newbu- ryport anti-nationalists, the opposing wings of the old Federalist Party). Jedidiah Morse made Andover the headquar- ters of a rather heroic, anti-racist, Christian missionary movement, bringing literacy, print- ing presses, medicine, and technological edu- cation to Southeast Asia and American Indians, notably the Georgia Cherokees. This activist Andover doctrine of racial equality and Ameri- can Revolutionary .spirit was despised and feared by-Bqtish opiym pushers in East Asia ,and.by~Boston's~blueblo6d.Anglophil~do- ver missionaries were eventually jailed in Georgia; their too-modem Cherokee allies were murdered and driven into exile by pro- slavery mobs. When Jedidiah Morse's generation died out, the Andover missionary movement was crushed by New England's elite families--who , were then Britain's partners in the booming opium traffic. Andover was still formally Chris- tian after 1840; Boston's cynical Brahmins used Andover's orthodox Protestant board to prose- cute various of their opponents as \"heretics.\" Neo-paganism and occult movements bloomed after the Civil War with Darwin's new materialist doctrines. In the 1870s. the death- worshipping Skull and Bones 'Society sent its alumni members back from Yale University, to organize aristocratic secret satanic societies for the teenagers at the Andover prep school. But these cults did not yet quite flourish. Na- tional power was still precariously balanced between the imperial Anglo-American finan- ciers, and the old-line nationalists who built America's railroads, steel and electrical indus- tries. The New Age aristocrats proclaimed their victory under Theodore Roosevelt's presidency (1901-09). The Andover Theological Seminary wound up its affairs and moved out of town, to be merged with the Harvard Divinity School! Andover prep school was now largely free of '. the annoyance of religion, or any connection whatsoever with the American spirit Secret so- cieties for the school's children, modeled on the.barbarian orders at Yale, were now estab- lished in permanent, incorporated headquar- ters buildings just off campus at Andover. Offi- cial school advisers were assigned to each se- cret society, who participated in their cruel and literally insane rituals When J.P. Morgan partner Thomas Cochran built Aqdover's luxurious modem campus for boys like Poppy Bush, the usurpers of Ameri- ca's name had cause to celebrate. Under their supervision, fascism was rising in Europe. The new campus library wasnamed for Oliver Wen- dell Holmes, Andover class of 1825. This dread- ful poet of the \"leisure class,\" a tower of Boston blue-blooded conceit, was famous as the father of the twentieth century U.S. Supreme Court justice. His son, Oliver .Wendell Holmes, Jr., symbolized the arbitrary rule of the racial puri- ty advocates, the usurpers, over American so- ciety. f The Secret Societies Andover installed a new headmaster in 1933. Claude Moore Fuess (rhymes with fleece) re- placed veteran headmaster Alfred E Steams, whom the Brahmins saw as a dyed-in-the-wool reactionary. Steams was forced out over a \"scandal\": a widower,. he had married his housekeeper, who was beneath his social class. The new headmaster: was considered for- ward-looking and flexible, 'to meet the chal- lenges of the world political crisis: for example, Fuess favored psy&iatry for the boys, some- thing Steams wouldn't tolerate. Claude Fuess had been an Andover history teacher since 1908, and gained fame as an histo- rian. He was one of the most skillful liars of the modem age. Fuess had mamed into the Boston Cushin family. He had written the family-authorize a"},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"whitewash biography of his wife's relative, Ca- leb Cushing, a pro-slavery politician of the mid- dle nineteenth century. The outlandish, widely known corruption of Cushing's career was matched by Fuess's bold, outrageous coverup.\" During George Bush's years at Andover, his headmaster, Fuess, wrote an authorized biog- raphy of Calvin Coolidge, the late U.S. Presi- dent This work was celebrated in jest as a champion specimen of unwholesome flattery. In other books, also about the bluebloods, Fuess was simply given the family papers and designated the chief liar for the \"Bostonian Race.\" Both the Cushing and Coolidge families had made their fortunes in opium trafficking. Bush's headmaster named his son John Cushing Fuess, perhaps atter the fabled nineteenth cen- tury dope kingpin who had made the Cushings rich.\" Headmaster Fuess used to say to his staff, \"1 came to power with Hitler and Mussolini\"\" This was not merely a pleasantry, refemng to his appointment the year Hitler took over Germany. In his 1939 memoirs, Headmaster Fuess ex- pressed the philosophy which must guide the education of the well-born younggentl emen un- der his care: \"Our declining birth rate. . . may perhaps in- dicate a step towards national deterioration. Among the so-called upper and leisure classes, noticeably among the university group, the present birth rate is strikingly low. Among the Slavonic and Latin immigrants, on the other hand, it is relatively high:We seem thus to be letting the best blood thin out and disappear, while at the same time our humanitarian efforts for the preservation of the less fit, those who for some reason are crippled and incapacitated, are being greatly stimulated. The effect on the race will not become apparent for some genera- tions and certainly cannot now be accurately predicted; but the phenomenon must be men- tioned if you are to have a true picture of what is going on in the United States.\"\" Would George Bush adopt this antikhristian outlook as his own? One can never how for sure how a young person will respond to the doctrines of his elders, no matter how cleverly presented. There is a much higher degree of certainty that he will conform to criminal ex- pectations, however, if the student is brought to practice cruelty against other youngsters, and to degrade himself in order to get ahead. At Andover, this was where the secret societies came in. Nothing like Andover's secret societies exist- ed at any other American school. What were they all about? Bush's friend Fitzhugh Greene wrote in 1989: \"Robert L Tim' Ireland, Bush's longtime sup porter [and Brown Brothers Harriman partner], who later served on the Andover board of trust- ees with him, said he believed [Bush] had been in AUV. 'What's that?' I asked. 'Can't tell you,' laughed Ireland. 'It's secret!' Both at Andover and Yale, such groups only bring in a small percentage of the total enrollment in any class. That's a bit cruel to those who dost make AU[Vl or 'Bones,' \" conceded Ireland. - Andover Headmaster Claticte M. Fuess A retired teacher, who was an advisor to one of the groups, cautiously disclosed in his bicen- tennial history of Andover; some aspects of the secret societies. The reader should keep in mind that this account was published by the school, to celebrate itself: \"A charming account of the early days of KO.& the oldest of the Soci- eties, was prepared by Jack [i.e. Claude Moore] Fuess, a member of the. organization, on the occasion of their Fiftieth Anniversary. The So- ciety was founded in.. . 1874. .'. . \"[A] major concern of the membership was the initiation ceremony. In K0.A. the ceremony involved visiting one of the local cemeteries at midnight, various kinds of tortures, running the gauntlet-though the novice was apparrently punched rather than paddled, being baptized in a water tank, being hoisted in the air by a pulley, and finally being placed in a coffin, where he was cross-examined by the members. . . . K0.A was able to hold the loyalty of its members over the years to become a powerful institution at Phillips Academy and to erect a handsome pillared Society house on School Street . \"The second Society of the seven that would survive until 1950 was A.U.V. [George Bush's group). The letters stood for Auctoritas, Unitas, Veritas. [Authority. Unity, Truth). This organi- zation resulted from a merger of two. . . earlier Societies . . . in 1877. A new constitution was drawn up. . . providing for four chief officers-- Imperator [commander], Vice Imperator [vice- commander], Scriptor [secretary], and Quaes- tor [magistrate or inquistor). . . . \"Like K0.A. A.U.V. had an elaborate initia- tion ceremony. Once a pledge had been ap proved by the Faculty, he was given a letter with a list of rules he was to follow. He was to be in the cemetery every night from 12:30 to 5:00, deliver a morning paper to each member of the Society each morning, must not comb or brush his hair nor wash his face or hands, smoke nothing but a clay pipe with Lucky Strike tobacco, and not speak to any student except' members of A.U.V."},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"\"Afler the pledge had memorized these rules, his letter of instruction was burned. The pledge had now become a 'scut' and was compelled to learn many mottoes and incantations. On Fri- day night of initiation week the scut was taken to Hartigan's drugstore downtown and given a 'scut sundae,' which consisted of pepper, ice cream, oysters, and raw liver. Later that night he reported to the South Church cemetery, where he had to wait for two hours for the mem- bers to arrive. There followed the usual horse- play-the scut was used as a tackling dummy, threats were made to lock him in a tomb, and various other ceremonies observed. On Satut- day ahrnoon the scut was taken on a long walk around town, being forced to stop at some hous- es and ask for food, to urinate on a few porches, and generally to make a fool of himself. On Sat- urday night came the initiation proper. The scut was prepared by reporting to the cellar in his underwear and having dirt and Bour smeared all over his body. He was finally cleaned up and brought to the initiation room, where a solemn ceremony followed, ending with the longed-for words 'Let him have light,' at which point his blindfold was removed, some oaths were administered, and the boy was fi- nally a member. . . .\" ls Notes for Chapter 4 16.

In the yearbook just above the AUV roster is a photograph of\"Rocky Rockefel- ler\" and \"Lem [Lehman F.1 Beardsiey\"; Rocke- feller stands imperiously without a shirt, Bear- dsley scowls from behind sunglasses. Certainly the real monarch of George Bush's Andover se- cret society, and George's sponsor, was this \"Rocky' \"s father, Codfrey S. Rockefeller. The latter gentleman had been on the staff of the Yale University establishment in China in 1921-22. Yale and the Rockefellers were breed- ing a grotesque communist insurgency with British Empire ideology; another Yale staffer there was Mao Zedong, later the communist dic- tator and mass murderer. While he was over in China, Papa Codfrey's cousin Isabel had been the bridesmaid at the wedding of George Bush's parents. His Uncle Percy had cwfounded the Harriman bank with Gqorge Walker, and backed George Bush's father in several Nazi German enterprises. His grandfather had been the founding treasurer of the Standard Oil Com- pany, and had made the'Harrimans (and thus ultimately George Bush) rich. Faculty adviser to AUV in those days was Norwood Penrose Hallowell; his father by the same name was chairman of Lee, Bigginson 6 Co. private bankers, the chief financiers of Bos- ton's extreme racialist political movements. The elder Hallowell was based in London throughout the 1930s. on intimate terms with Montagu Norman and his pro-Hitler American banking friends. . . . One of Poppy Bush's teachers at Andover, now in retirement, offered to an interviewer for this book, a striking picture of his former pupil. How was the President as a student? \"He never said a word in class. He was bored to death. And other teachers told me.Bush was the worst English Student ever in the school.\" But was this teenager simply slow, or dull? On the contrary. \"He was the classic 'BMOC' (Big Man On Campus). A great glad-hander. Always smil- ing.\" I.. . . George Bush was the most insistent self-pro- moter on the campus. He was able to pursue this career, being fortunately spared from the more mundane chores some other students had to do. For example, he mailed his dirty laundry home each week, to be done by the servants. It was mailed back to him clean and folded.=. . . . One may ask, ia what way are President Bush and his backers conscious of an oligarchical tradition? For a clue, let us look at the case of Arthur Burr Darling, George Bush's Prep school history teacher. Just aRer Claude Fuess \"came into power with Hitler and Mussolini\" in 1933, Fuess brought [Arthur Burr] Darling in to teach. Dr. Darling was head of the Andover history de- partment from 1937 to 1956. and Faculty Guard- ian of one of the secret societies. His Political Changes in M~ssachusctts, 1824 to 1848 covered the period, of Andover's eclipse by Boston's aristocaticaphmlordr;Darlingss book attacks Andover's greatest humanitarian, Jedidiah Morse, as a dangerous lunatic, because Morse warned about international criminal conspira- 0603 cies involving these respectable Bostonians. The same book attacks President John Quincy Adams as a misguided traublemalter, responsi- ble with Morse for the anti-fkeemasonic move- ment in the 1820s-30s. ' Arthur Burr Darling, while still head of An- dover's history department, was chosen by the Harrimanites to organize the historical files of the new Central Intelligence Agency, and to write the CIA'S own official account of its cre- ation and first years. Since this cynical project was secret, Darling's 1971 obituary did not re- flect his CIA employmentJO Darling's The CentmI 1nteUigmce Agency: An instrument of Gmmment, to 1950 was classified Secret on its completion in December 1953.. . . This mercenary work was finally declassified in 1989 and was published by Pennsylvania State University in 1990. Subsequent editions of Who Was Who in Am were changed, in the fash- ion of Joe Stalin's \"history revisers;\" to tell the latest, official version of what George Bush's history teacher had done with his life. . . . Secretary of War Henry Stimson, who was also the president of the board of Andover Prep, made a famous speech in June 1942, to Poppy Bush and the other graduating Andover boys. Stimson told them the war would be long, and they, the elite, should go on to college. But George Bush had some very complicated problems. The decision had already been made that he would join the service and get quite far away from where he had been. For reasons of - family (which will be discussed in Chapter 7 on Skull and Bones) there was a very special niche waiting for him in naval aviation. There was one serious hitch in this plan. It was illegal. Though hewould be 18 years old on June 12, he would not have the two yeari of college the Navy required for its aviators. Well, if you had an urgent problem, perhaps the law could be simply set as&, fmyou and you done, ahead of all the 5 million poor slobs who had to go in the mud with the infantry or swab some stinking deck--especially if your private school's president was currently Secretary of War (Henry Stimson), if your father's banking partner was currently Assistant Secretary of War for Air (Robert Lovett), and if your father had launched the career of the current Assis- tant Navy Secretary for Air (Artemus Gates). And it was done. As a Bush-authorized version puts it, \"One wonders why the Navy relaxed its two years of college requirement for flight .training in George Bush's case. He had built an outstand- ing record at school as a scholar [sic], athlete and campus leader, but so had countless thou- sands of other youths. \"Yet it was George Bush who appeared to be the only beneficiary of this rule-waiving, and thus he eventually emerged as the youngest pi- lot in the Navy-a fact that he can still boast about and because of which he enjoyed a cer- tain celebrity during the war.'* Net43 21.

During the 1964 Senate campaign in Texas against Senator Ralph Yarborough, Bush tele- vised a grainy old film which depicted young George being rescued at sea by the crew of the submarine USS Finnback aRer his Avenger tor- pedo bomber was hit by Japanese anti-aircraft fire during a bombing raid on the island of Chi- chi Jima on September 2, 1944. That film, re- trieved from the Navy archives, backfired when it was put on the air too many times, eventually becoming something of a maladroit cliche. Bush's campaign literature has always cele- brated his alleged military exploits and the Dis- tinguished Flying Cross he received. As we be come increasingly familiar with the power of the Brown Brothers HarrimanlSkull and Bones network working for Senator Prescott Bush, we will learn to become increasingly skeptical of such official accolades and of the official ac- counts on which they are premised. During Bush's Gulf war adventure of 1990. 91, the adulation of Bush's ostensible warrior prowess reached levels that were previously considered characteristic of openly totalitari- an and militaristic regimes. Late in 1990, aRer Bush had committed himself irrevocably to his campaign of bombing and savagery against Iraq, hack writer Joe Hyams completed an au- thorized account of George Bush at war. This was entitled Flight of the Awnqer, and appeared during the time of the Middle East conflagra- tion that was the product of Bush's obsessions Hyams's work had the unmistakeable impri- matur of the regime: Not just George, but also Barbara had been interviewed during its prep aration, and its adulatory tone placed this squalid text squarely within the \"red Studebak- er\" school of political hagiography. The appearance of such a book at such a time is suggestive of the practice of the most infa- mous twentiethcentury dictatorships, in which the figure of the strong man, Fuehrer, duce, or vozhd as he might be called, has been used for the transmission of symbolic-allegorical direc- tives to the subject population. Was fascist Italy seeking to assert its economic autarky in food production in the face oftrade sanctions by the League of Nations? Then a film would be pro- duced by the MINCULPOP (the Ministry of Pop ular Culture. or propaganda) depicting Musso- lini indefatigably harvesting grain. Was Nazi Germany in the final stages of preparation of a military campaign against a neighboring state? 'If so, Goebbels would orchestrate a cascade of magazine articles and best-selling pulp evoking the glories of Hitler in the trenches of 191418. Closer to our own time, Leonid Brezhnev sought to aliment his own personality cult with a little book called M&p Zernlya, an account of his war experiences which was used by his propa- gandists to motivate his promotion to Marshal of the U.S.S.R. and the erection of a statue in his honor during his own lifetime. This is the tradition to which Flight ofthe Avenger belongs. Bush tells us in his campaign autobiography that he decided to enlist in the armed forces, 0 specifically naval aviation, shortly aRer he heard of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. About six months later, Bush graduated from Phillips Academy at Andover, and the com- mencement speaker was Secretary of War Hen- ry Stimson, eminencergpi$e.of the U.S; ~lipg elite. Stimson was possibly mindful of the heca- tomb of young members of the British ruling classes which had occurred in the trenches of World War I on the western front In any event, Stimson's advice to the Andover graduates was that the war would go on for a long time, and that the best way of serving the country was to continue one's education in college. Prescott Bush supposedly asked his son if Stimson's rec- ommendation had altered his plan to enlist Young Bush answered that he was still commit- ted to join the Navy. Henry L Stimson was certainly an authorita- tive spokesman for the Eastern Liberal Estab lishment, and Bushman propaganda has lately exalted him as one of the seminal influences on Bush's political outlook. Stimson had been educated at both Yale (where he had been tapped by Skull and Bones) and Harvard Law School. He became the law partner of Elihu Root, who was Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary of State. Stimson had been Theodore Roose- velt's anticorruption, trust-busting U.S. Attor- ney in New York City during the first years of the FBI, then Taws secretary of war, a colonel of artillery in World War I, governor general of the Philippines for Coolidge, secretary of state for Hoover, and enunciator of the \"Stimson doc- trine.\" This last was a piece of hypocritical pos- turing directed against Japan, asserting that changes in the international order brought about by force of arms (and thus in contraven- tion of the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928) should not be given diplomatic recognition. This amounted to a U.S. commitment to uphold the Versailles system, the same policy upheld by Baker, Eagleburger and Kissinger in the Serbi- an war on Slovenia and C~natia during 1991. Stimson.though a Republican, was brought into Roosevelt's war cabinet in 1940 in token of bi- partisan intentions. But in 1942, Bush was not buying Stimson's advice. It is doubtless significant that in the mind ofyoung George Bush, World War 11 meant exclusively the war in the Pacific, against the Japanese. In the Bush-approved accounts of this period of his life, there is scarcely a men- tion of the European theatre, despite the fact that Roosevelt and the entire Anglo-American establishment had accorded strategic priority to the \"Germany first\" scenario. Young George, it would appear, had his heart set on becoming a Navy flier. \"The Bush p apda machine needs the .fire on bd 3 e Avenger in order to .@ti@ Bush's precipitous -on to bail out, leaving his two acw memb to -their fitc, rather than attem ting the landing which might e saved :themn L 60L"},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"Rules Bent for Bush. Normally the Navy required two years of col- lege from volunteers wishing to become naval aviators. But, for reasons which have never been satisfactorily explained, young George was exempted from this requirement. Had fa- ther Prescott's crony Artemus Gates, the assis- tant secretary of the navy for air, been instru- mental in making the exception, which was the key to allowing George to become the youngest of all navy pilots? On June 12, 1942, his eighteenth birthday, Bush joined the Navy in Boston as a seaman second class.' He was ordered to report for ac- tive duty as an aviation cadet on August 6,1942. After a last date with Barbara, George was tak- en to Penn Station in New York City by father Prescott to board a troop train headed for Char;- el Hill, North Carclina. At Chapel Hill Naval Air Station, one o. aush's fellow cadets was the well-known Boston Red Sox hitter Ted Wil- liams, who would later join Bush on the cam- paign trail in his desperate fight in the New Hampshire primary in February 1W. After preflight training at Chapel Hill, Bush moved on to Wold-Chamberlain Naval Airfield in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he flew solo for the first time in November 1942 In February 1943 Bush moved on to Corpus Christi,Texas for further training. Bush received his commission as an ensign at Corpus Christi on June 9,1943. Afler this, Bush moved through a number of naval air bases over a period of almost a year for various types of advanced training. In mid- June 1943, he was learning to fly the Crumman TBF Avenger torpedo-bomber at Fort Lauder- dale, Florida. In August, he made landings on the USS Sable, a paddle-wheel ship that was used as an aircraA carrier for training pur- poses. During the summer of 1943, Bush spent a couple of weeks of leave-with Barbara at. Walker's Point in Kennebunkport; their en- gagement was announced in the Ncro York Times of December 12,1943. Later in the summer of 1943, Bush moved on to the Naval Air Base at Norfolk, Virginia In September 1943 Bush's new squadron, called VT-51, moved on to the Naval Air Station at Chincoteague, Virginia, located on the Del- marva peninsula On December 14,1843 Busb and his squadron were brought to Philadelphia to attend the commissioning of the USS Sun Jacinto (CVI.3). a light attack carrier built on a cruiser hull. Since the name of the ship re- called Sam Houston's defeat of the Mexican leader Santa Ana in 1836, and since the ship flew a Lone Star flag, Bushman propaganda has made much of these artifacts in an attempt to buttress \"carpetbag\" Bush's tenuous connec- tions to the state of Texas. Bush's VF-51 squad- ron reported on board this ship for a shake- down cruise on February 6,1944, and on March 25,1944 the San Jocinto left for San Diego by way of the Panama Canal. The SanJacinto reached Pearl Harbor on April 20, 1944, and was as- signed to Admiral Mare A. Mitscher's Task Force W38, a group of fast carriers, on May 2, 1944. Bush Bails Out In ~ude, Bush's ship joined battle with Japa- nese forces in the Marianas archipelago. Here Bush flew his first combat missions. On June 17. a loss of oil pressure forced Bush to make an emergency landing at sea. Bush, along with his two crew members, gunner Leo Nadeau and radioman-tail gunner John L Delaney, were picked up by a U.S. destroyer after some hours in the water. Bush's first Avenger, named by him the Barbara, was lost. During July 1944 Bush took part in 13 air strikes, many in connection with the U.S. Ma- rines' landing on Guam. In August, Bush's ship proceeded to the area of Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima in the Bonin Islands for a new round of sorties, On September 2,1944 Bush and three other Avenger pilots, escorted by Hellcat fighter planes. were directed to attack a radio trans- mitter on Chichi Jima. Planes from the USS En- teqnise would also join in the attack On this mission Bush's rear-seat gunner would not be the usual Leo Nadeau, but rather Lt Junior Grade William Gardner Ted\" White, the squadron ordnance officer of VT-51, already a Yale graduate and already a member of Skull and Bones. White's father had beep a classmate of Prescott Bush. White took his place in the rear-facing machine gun turret of Bush's TBM Avenger, the Barbara IL The radioman-gunner was John L Delaney, a regular member of Bush's crew. What happened in the skies of Chichi Jima that day is a matter of lively controversy. Bush has presented several differing versions of his own story. In his campaign autobiography pub- lished ifi 1987 Bush gives the following account: \"The flak was the heaviest I'd ever flown into. The Japanese were ready and waiting: their anti-aircraft guns were set up to nail us as we pushed into our hives. By the time VT-51 was ready to go in, the sb was thick with angry black clouds of exploding anti-aircraft fire. . \"Don Melvin led the way, scoring hits on a radio tower. I followed, going into a thirty-five degree dive. an angle of attack that sounds shal- low but in an Avenger felt as if you were headed straight down. The target map was strapped to my knee. and as I started into my dive, I'd al- ready spotted the target area. Coming in, I was aware of black splotches of gunfire all around. \"Suddenly there was a jolt, as if a massive fist had crunched into the belly ofthe plane. Smoke poured into the cockpit, and I could see flames rippling aeross the crease of the wing edging towards the fuel tanks. I stayed with the dive, homed in on the target, unloaded our four 500- pound bombs, and pulled away, heading for the sea. Once over water, I leveled off and told De- laney and White to bail out, turning the plane to starboard to take the slipstream off the door near Delaney's station. \"Up to that point, except for the sting of dense smoke blurring my vision. I was in fair shape. But when I went to make my jump, trouble came in pairs.'u In this account, there is no more mention of"},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"White and Delaney until Bush hit the water and began looking around for them. Bush says that it wa8 only after having been rescued by the USS Finnback, a submarine, that he \"learned that nenher Jack Delaney nor Ted White had survived. One went down with the plane; the other was seen jumping, but his parachute failed to open.\" The Hyams account of 1991 was written after an August 1988 interview with Chester Mienejewski, another member of Bush's squadron, had raised important ques- tions about the haste with which Bush bailed out, rather thah attempting a water landing. Mienejewsld's account, which is summarized below, contradicted Bush's own version of these events, and hinted that Bush might have abandoned his two crew members to a horrible and needless death. The Hyams account, which is partly .intended to refute Mienejewski, de- velnns as fnllnwo. \"?':'.Bush'-was pilotirigtne thlrd plane'ovkr the.target. with Moore flying on his wing. He nosed over into a thirtydegree glide, heading straight for the radio tower. Determined to fi- nally destroy the tower, he used no evasive tac- tics and held the plane directly on target His vision ahead was occasionally cancelled by bursts of black smoke from the Japanese anti- aircraft guns. The plane was descending through thickening clouds of flak pierced by the flaming arc of tracers. 'There was a sudden flash of light followed by an explosion. 'The plane was lifted forward, and we were enveloped in flames,' Bush recalls. 'I saw the flames running along the wings where the fuel tanks were and where the wings fold. I thought, This is really bad! It's hard to remem- ber the details, but I looked at the instruments and couldn't see them for the smoke.' \"Don Melvin, circling above the action while waiting for his pilots to drop their bombs and get out, thought the Japanese shell had hit an oil line on Bush's Avenger. 'You could have seen that smoke for a hundred miles.' \" Perhaps so, but it is difficult to understand why the smoke from Bush's plane was so dis- tinctly visible in such a smoke-filled environ- ment Hyams goes on to describe Bush's com- pletion of his bombing run. His account con- tinues: \"By then the wings were covered in flames and smoke, and the engine was blazing. He con- sidered making a water landing but realized it would not be possible. Bailing out was abso- lutely the last choice, but he had no other op tion. He got on the radio and notified squadron leader Melvin of his decision. Melvin radioed back, 'Received your message. Got you in sight. Will follow.' \"1. . .]Milt Moore, flying directly behind Bush. saw the Avenger g3ing down smoking. 'I pulled up to him; then he lost power and I went sailing by him.' \"As soon as he was back over water, Bush shouted on the intercom for White and Delaney to 'hit the silk!' [. .I Dick Gorman, Moore's ra- dioman-gunner, remembers hearing someone on the intercom shout. 'Hit the silk!' and asking Moore, 'Is that you, Red?' \" 'No,' Moore replied. 'It's Bush, he's hit!' \"Other squadron members heard Bush re- peating the command to bail out, over and over. on the radio. ''There was no response from either of Bush's crewmen and no way he could see them; a shield of'armor plate between him and Lt White blocked his view behind. He was certain that White and Delaney had bailed out the mo- ment they got the order.'* Hyams quotes a later entry by Melvin in the squadron log as to the fate of Bush's two crew- men: \"At a point approximately nine miles bearing 04ST (degrees) from Minami Jima, Bush and one other person were seen to bail out from about 3,000 feet Bush's chute opened. and he landed safely in the water, inflated his raft, and paddled farther away from Chichi Jima. The chute of the other person who bailed out did not open. Bush has not yet been re- turned to the squadron . . . so this information is incomplete. While Lt junior grade White and J.L Delaney are reported missing in action, it is believed that both were killed as a result of the above described action.'\" But it is interesting to note that this report, contrary to usual standard Navy practice, has no date. This should alert us to that tampering with public records, such as Bush's filings at the Securities and Exchange Commission dur- ing the 1960s. which appears to be a specialty of the Brown Brothers HarrimanlSkull and Bones network For comparison, let us now cite the cursory account of this same incident provided by .Bush's authorized biographer in the candi- date's 1980 presidential campaign biography: \"On a run toward the island, Bush's plane was struck by Japanese antiaircraft shells. One of his two crewmen was killed instantly and the aircraft was set on fire. Bush was able to score hits on the enemy instailations with a couple of five-hundred pound bombs before he wriggled out of the smoking cockpit and floated towards the water. The other crewman also bailed out but died almost immediately thereafter be- cause, as the fighter pilot behind Bush's plane was later to report, his parachute failed to open properly. Bush's own parachute became mo- mentarily fouled on the tail of the plane after he hit the water.'\" King's account is interesting for its omission of any mention of Bush's injury in bailing out, a gashed forehead he got when he struck the tail assembly of the plane. This had to have occurred long before Bush had hit the water, so this account is garbled indeed. Let us also cite parts of the account provided by Fitzhugh Green in his 1989 authorized biog- raphy. Green has Bush making his attack \"at a 60-degree angle.\" \"For his two crew members,\" notes Green. \"life was about to end.\" His ver- sion goes on: \"Halfway through Bush's dive, the enemy found his range with one or more shells. Smoke filled his cabin; his plane controls weakened; the engine began coughing, and still he wasn't close enough to the. target He .presumed the TBM to be terminally damaged. Fighting to stay on course, eyes smarting, Bush managed to launch his bombs at the last possible moment He couldn't discern the result through black fumes. But a companion pilot affirmed later that the installation blew up, along with two other buildings. The Navy would decorate Bush for literally sticking to his guns until he com- pleted his mission under ferocious enemy fire."},{"pageNumber":732,"pageContent":"\"Good! Now the trick was to keep the plane aloft long enough to accomplish two objectives: first, get far enough away from the island to allow rescue from the sea before capture or killing by the enemy; second, give his plane mates time to parachute out of the burning air- cratt. 'The TBM sputtered on its last few hundred yards. Unbeknownst to Bush, one man freed himself. Neither fellow squadron pilots nor Bush ever were sure which crew member this was. As he jumped, however, his parachute snarled and failed to open.'* Green writes that when Bush was swimming ' in the water, he realized that \"his crew had disappeared\" and that \"the loss of the two men numbed Bush\" - Still Another Story For the 1992 presidential campaign, the Bushmen have readied yet another rehash of the adulatoryured Studebaker\" printout in the form of a new biography by Richard Ben Cram- er. This is distinguished as a literary effort above all by the artificial verbal pyrotechnics with which the author attempts to breathe new life into the dog-eared Bush canonical printout For these, Cramer relies on a hyperkinetic style with nonverbal syntax, which to some degree echoes Bush's own disjointed manner of speak- ing. The resulting text may have found favor with Bush when he wasgripped by his hyperthy- roid rages during the buildup for the Gulf war. A part of this text has appeared in Esquire maga- zine.? Here is Cramer's description of the criti- cal phase of the incident:. \"He felt a jarring lurch, a crunch, and his plane leaped forward, like a giant had struck it from below with a fist Smoke started to fill the cockpit He saw a tongue of flame streaming down the right wing toward the crease:Christ! The fuel tanks! \"He called to Delaney and White-We've been hit! He was diving. Melvin hit the tower dead-on-four five hundred pounders. West was on the same beam Bush could have pulled out. Have to get rid of these bombs. Keep the dive. . . . A few seconds. . . . \"He dropped on the target and let 'em fly. The bombs spun down, the plane shrugged with release, and Bush banked away hard to the east No way he'd get to the rendezvous point with Melvin. The smoke was so bad he couldn't see the gauges. Was he climbing? Have to get to the water. They were dead if they bailed out over land. The Japs killed pilots. Conna have to bail out Bush radioed.the skipper, called his crew. No answer. Does White know how to get to his chute? Bush looked back for an instant Cod, was White hit?

NOW..\" 0 It will be seen that these versions contain numerous internal contradictions, but that the hallmark of \"red Studebaker\" orthodoxy, espe- cially after the appearance of the Mienejewsky account, is that Bush's plane was on fire, with visible smoke and flames. The Bush propagan- da machine needs the fire on board the Avenger ih order to justify Bush's precipitous decision to bail out, leaving his two crew members to their fate, rather than attempting the water landing which migh! have saved them. The only person who has ever claimed to have seen Bush's plane get hit, and to have seen it hit the water, is Chester Mienejewksi, who was the rear turret gunner in the aircraft flown by Squadron Commander Douglas Melvin. During 1987-88, Mienejewksi became increasingly in- dignant as he watched Bush repeat his canoni- cal account of how he was shot down. Shortly before the Republican National Convention in 1988, Mierjekewski, by then a &year-old re- tired aircraR foreman living in Cheshire, Con- necticut, decided to tell his story to Allan Wolper and A1 Ellenberg of the New York Post, which printed it as a copyrighted article.' That guy is not telling the truth,\" Mienejew- ski said of Bush. As the rear-looking turret gunner on Com- mander Melvin's plane, Mienejewski had the most advantageous position for observing the events in question here. Since Melvin's plane flew directly ahead of Bush's, he had a direct and unobstructed view of what was happening aft of his own plane. When the New York Post reporters asked former Lt Legare Hole, the ex- ecutive officer of Bush's squadron, about who might have best observed the last minutes ofthe Barbara 11, Hole replied: \"The turret gunner in Meivin's plane would have had a good view. If the plane was on fire, there is a very good chance he would be able to see that The pilot can't see everything that the gunner can. and he'd miss an awful lot,\" Hole told the New York Post. Cunner Lawrence Mueller of Milwaukee, an- other former member of Bush's squadron who flew on the Chichi Jima mission, when asked who would have had the best view, replied: 'The turret gunner of Melvin's plane.\" Mienej- ewksi for his part said that his plane was fiying about 100 feet ahead of Bush's plane during the incident-so close that he could see into Bush's cockpit Mienejewki, who is also a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross, told the New York Post that he saw \"a puff of smoke\" come out of Bush's plane and quickly dissipate. He asserted that after that there was no more smoke visible. that Bush's \"plane was never on fire\" and that \"no smoke came out of his cockpit when he opened his canopy to bail out\" Mienejewski stated that only one man ever got out of the Barbara 11, and that was Bush himself. \"I was hoping I would see some other parachutes. I never did. I saw the plane go down. I knew the guys were still in it It was a helpless feeling\" Yienejewski has long been troubled by the notion that Bush's decision to parachute from his damaged aircraft might have cost the lives of Radioman second classJohn Delaney, a close friend of Mienejewksi, as well as gunner Lt junior grade William White. 'I think [Bush] 607"},{"pageNumber":733,"pageContent":"could have saved those lives, if they were alive. I don't know that they were, but at least they had a chance if he had attempted a water landing,\" Mienejewski told the New York Post. Former executive officer Legare Hole summed up the question for the New York Post reporters as follows: \"If the plane is on fire, it hastens your decision to bail out If it is not on fire, you make a water landing.\" The point is that a water landing held out more hope for all members of the crew. The Avenger had been designed to float for approximately two min- utes, giving the tailgunner enough time to in- flate a raR and giving everyone an extra margin of time to get free of the plane before it sank Bush had'carried out a water landing back in June when his plane had lost oil pressure. The official-but undated-report on the in- cident among the squadron records was signed by Commander Melvin and an intelligence of- ficer named Lt Martin E. Kilpatrick Kilpatrick is deceased, and Melvin in 1988 was hospital- ized with Parkinson's disease and could not be interviewed. Mienejewski in early August 1988 had never seen the undated intelligence report in question \"Kilpatrick was the first person I spoke to when we got back to the ship,\" he said. \"I told him what I saw. I don't understand why it's not in the report.\" Cunner Lawrence Mueller tended to corrob- orate Mienejewki's account Mueller had kept flight of the Avenger, the book commissioned by George Bush to tell of his bravery under fire. a log book of his own in which he made nota- tions as the squadron was debriefed in the ready room after each mission. For September 2,1944, Mueller's personal log had the following entry: \"White and Delaney presumed to have gone down with plane.\" Mueller told the New YorkPost that \"no parachute wassighted except Bush's when the plane went down.\" The New York Post, reporters were specific that, ac- cording to Mueller, no one in the San Jacinto ready room during the debriefing had said any- thing about a fire on board Bush's plane. Muell- er said: \"I would.have put it,in my logbook if I had heard it\" According to this New Yotk Post article, the report of Bush's debriefing aboard the subma- rine Finnback aRer his rescue makes no men- tion of any fire aboard the plane. When the New York Post reporters interviewed Thomas R. Keene, an airman from another carrier, who had been picked up by the Finnback a few days after Bush, they referred to the alleged fire on board Bush's plane and \"Keene was surprised to hear\" it. \" 'Did he say that?,' \" Keene asked. Leo Nadeau, Bush's usual rear turret gunner, who had been in contact with Bush during the 1980s. attempted to undercut Mienejewski's credibility by stating that \"Ski,\" as Mienejew- ski was called, would have been \"too busy shooting\" to have been able to focus on the events involving Bush's plane. But even the pro- Bush accounts agree that the reason that White had been allowed to come aloftin the first place was the expectation that there would be no Jap anese aircraft over the target, making a thor- oughly trained and experienced gunner super- fluous. Indeed, no account alleges that any Jag anese aircraft appeared over Chichi Jima. Bush and Mienejewski met again on board the San Jacinto after the downed pilot was re- turned from the Finnback about a month after the loss of the Barbara 11. According to the New York Post account, about a month after all these events Bush, clad in Red Cross pajamas, re- turned to the San Jacinto. \"He came into the ready room and sat down next to me,\" Mienej- ewksi recounted. \"He [Bush] knew I saw the whole thing. He said, 'Ski, I'm sure those two men were dead. I called them on the radio three times. They were dead.' When he told me they were dead. I couldn't prove they weren't. He The New York Post, August 12, 1988, quoted eyewit- ness Chester Mierzejewski debunking Bysh's self-de- scribed heroism. The Post's extensive coverage fea- tured pictures of Bush as a naval aviator, the gunner who challenged his tale of heroism, and the two young men who died in the crash Bush survived. seemed distraught He was trying to assure me he did the best he could. I'm thinking what am I going to say to him,\" Mienejewski commented id 1988. Mierzejewski began to become concerned about Bush's presentation of his war record while watching Bush's December 1987 inter-"},{"pageNumber":734,"pageContent":"view with David Frost, which was one of the candidate's most sanctimonious performances. In March 1988, Mienejeweski wrote to Bush and told him that his recollections were very different from the Vice President's story. Mier- zejewski's letter was not hostile in tone, but voiced concern that political opponents might come forward to dispute Bush. There was no reply to this letter. and Chester Mie~ejewski ultimately elected to tell his own unique eye- witness version ofthe facts to the New York Post. Certainly his authoritative, first-hand account places a large question mark over the events of September 2,1944, which Bush has so often sought to exploit for political gain. Several days after Mienejewslti's interview was published, Bush's office obtained and re- leased to the press a copy of the (undated) squadron log report'one Donald Rhodes of Bush's office called Mienejewlrsi to offer him a copy of the report It is typical of Joe Hyams's hack work for Bush in The Flight oj the Avenger that he never mentions Mienejewksi's critical account, al- though he is obviously acutely aware of the ob- jections raised by Mienejewski and wants very much to discredit those objections. Indeed, Hy- ams totally ignores Mierzejewski as a source, and also studiously ignores the other witness who would have supported Mienejewski, that is to say Mueller. Hyams had the support of Bush's White House staff in arranging inter- views for his book, but somehow he never got around to talking to Mienejewski and Mueller. This must increase our suspicion that Bush has some damning cicrumstance he wishes to hide. Bush himself admits that he was in a big hur- ry t~ get out of his cockpit: \"The wind was play- ing triclcs, or more likely, I pulled the rip cord too soon.*This caused his gashed forehead and damaged his parachute.

Averell Harriman, and even Presi- dent Roosevelt's confidant and virtual alter ego, Harry Hopkins, an asset of the Hamman .family. Bush was very upset about what had hap pened to his two crewmen. Later, during one of his Skull and Bones \"Life History\" selfexpo- sures, Bush referred to Lt. White, the Skull and Bones member who had gone to his death with the Barbara 11: \"I wish I hadn't let him go,\" said Bush, according to former Congressman Thomas W. L (Lud) Ashley, a fellow Skull and Bones member and during 1991 one of the ad- ministrators of the Neil Bush legal defense f.:nd. According to Ashley, \"Bush was heartbro- hen. He had gone over it in his mind 100,000 times and concluded he couldn't have done any- thing. . . . He didn't feel guilty about anything that happened. . . . But the incident was a source of real grief to him. It tore him up. real anguish, It was so fresh in his mind. He had a real friendship with this man,\" said Ashley.'' Bush later wrote letters to the families of the \"WeII, if you ' had. an ugettt problem, perhaps the law could be simply sct nsidc, *F~F Rtone, ahead of all the 5 mittion slobs who h&? go in the mud withthe~ty or swab some -deck.. .\" men who had died on his plane He received a reply from Delaney's sister, Mary Jane Delaney. The letter read in part: \"You mention in your letter that you would like to help me in some way. There is a way, and that is to stop thinking you are in any way responsible for your plane accident and what has happened to your men. I might have thought you were if my brother Jack had not always S~oken of you as the best pilot in the squadron.\"\" Bush also wrote a letter to his parents in which he talked about White and Delaney: \"I try to think about it as little as possible, yet I cannot get the thought of those two out of my mind. Oh, I'm OK-I want to By again and I won't be scared of it, but I know I won't be able to shake the memory of this incident and I don't believe I want to ~ompletely.\"~ As Bush himself looked back on all these events from the threshold of his genocidal as- sault on Iraq, he complacently concluded that the pagan fates had preserved his life for some future purpose. He told Hyams: There wasn't a sudden revelation of what I wanted to do with the rest of my life, but there was an awakening. There's no question that un- derlying all that were my own religious beliefs. In my own view there's got to be some kind of destiny and I was being spared for something on eartiLnu After having deliberately ignored the rele- vant dissenting views about the heroism of his patron, Hyams chooses to conclude his book on the following disturbing note: \"When Bying his Avenger off the deck of the San Jac, Bush was responsible for his own fate as well as his crewmen's. As Resident he is responsible for the fate of all Americans as well as that of much of the world.\" And that is precisely the problem. N.La Would to the gods that this k the IUt of his crimes! 1.

But we know that George Bush is a rapidly moving man Thus he was pleased with the spe- cial arrangement made for veterans, by which Yale allowed him to get his degree alter at- tending classes for only two and a half years.. . .

From all available tesiimony, his mental life before college was anything but outstanding. His campaign literature claims that, as a veter- an, Bush was \"serious\" at Yale. But we cannot check exactly how he achieved election to Phi Beta Kappa, in his abbreviated college experi- ence. Without top secret clearance, we cannot consult his test results, read his essays, or learn much about his performance in class. We know that his father was a trustee of the university, in charge of \"developmental\" fundraising. And his family friends were in control of the U.S. secret services. A great deal is known, however, about George Bush's status at Yale. His fellow student John H. Chafee, later a U.S. senator from Rhode Island and secretary of the navy, declared: \"We didn't see much of him because he was married, but I guess my first impression was that he was--and I don't mean this in a derogatory fashion-in the inner set, the movers and shakers, the establishment I don't mean he put on airs or anything, but.. . just everybody knew him.\" Chafee, like Bush and Dan Quayle, was in the important national fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon (DICE or the \"Dekes\"). But Chafee says; \"I never remember seeing him there.

Out of, those few . 20 were chosen for Bones membership. George was the lastone to be noti;, fied of his selection--this honor is traditionally reserved for the highest of the high and mighty. His father, Prescott Bush, several other rela- tives and partners, and Roland and Averell Harriman, who sponsored the Bush family, were also members of this secret society. . . . The order was incorporated in 1856 under the name \"Russell Trust Association.\" By special act of the state legislature in 1943, its trustees are exempted from the normal requirement of filing corporate reports with the Connecticut secretary of state. As of 1978, all business of the Russell Trust [owner of the Skull and Bones] was handled by its lone trustee, Brown Brothers Harriman partner John B. Madden, Jr. Madden started with Brown Brothers Harriman in 1946, under senior partner Prescott Bush, George Bush's father. Each year, Skull and Bones members select (\"tap\"Il5 third-year Yale students to replace them in the senior group the following year. Graduating members are given a sizeable cash bonus to help them get started in life. Older graduate members, the so-called \"Patriarchs.\" givespecial backing in business, politics, espie nage and legal careers to graduate Bonesmen who exhibit talent or usefulness. The home of Skull and Bones on the Yale campus is a stone building resembling a mauso- leum, and known as \"the Tomb.\" Initiations take place on Deer Island in the St Lawrence River (an island owned by the Russell Trust Association), with regular reunions on Deer Is- land and at Yale. Initiation rites reportedly in- clude strenuous and traumatic activities of the new member, while immersed naked in mud, 'and in a coffin. More important is the \"sexual autobiography\": The initiate tells the order all the sex secrets of his young life. Weakened men- tal defenses against manipulation, and the blackmail potential of such information, have obvious permanent uses in enforcing loyalty among members. The loyalty is intense. One of Bush's former teachers, whose own father was a Skull and Bones member, told our interviewer that his father used to stab his little Skull and Bones pin into his skin to keep it in place when he took a bath. Members continue throughout their lives to unburden themselves on their psychesexual thoughts to their Bones Brothers, even if they are no longer sitting in a coffin. This has been the case with President George Bush, for whom these ties are reported to have a deep personal meaning. Beyond the psychological manipula- tion asrociated with freemasonic mummery, there are very solid political reasons for Bush's strong identification with this Cult . . . Skull and Bones--the Russell Trust Associa- tion-was first established among the class graduating from Yale in 1833. Its founder was William Huntington Russell of Middletown. Connecticut. The Russell family was the master of incalculable wealth derived from the largest U.S. criminal organization of the nineteenth century: Russell and Company, the great opium , syndicate. There was at that time a deep suspicion of, and national revulsion against, freemasonry and secret organizatiom in the United States, fostered in particular by the anti-masonic writ- ings of former U.S. President John Quincy Ad- ams. Adams stressed that those who take oaths to politically powerful international secret sck cieties cannot be depended on for loyalty to a democratic republic. But the Russells were protected as part of the multiply intermarried grouping of families then ruling Connecticut. The blood-proud members of the Russell, Pierpont, Edwards, Burr, Griswold, Day; Alsop, and Hubbard fami- lies were prominent in the pro-British party within the state. Many of their sons would be among the members chosen for the Skull and Bones Society over €he years. :It, The background t~skull and on& is astory. of Opium and Empire, and a bitter struggle for political control over the new U.S. republic. Samuel Russell, ,second cousin to Bones founder William H.;'established Russell and Company in 1823. Its business was to acquire opium from Turkey and smuggle it into China, where it was strictly prohibited, under the armed protection of,the British Empire. The prior, predominant American gang in this field had been the syndicate created by Thomas Handasyd Perkins of Newburyport, Massachusetts, an aggregation of the self-styled \"bluebloods\" or Brahmins of Boston's north shore. Forced out of the lucrative African slave trade by U.S. law and Caribbean slave revolts, leaders of the Cabot, Lowell, Higginson, Forb- es, Cushing. and Sturgis families had married Perkins siblings and children. The Perkins opi- um syndicate made the fortune and established 'Tor George Bush, the Skull and Bones Society is more than simply the British, as opposed to the American, strategic tradition.

By the 1830s, the Russells had bought out the Perkins syndicate and made Connecticut the primary center of the U.S. opi- um racket Massachusetts families (Coolidge, Sturgis, Forbes, and Delano) joined Connecti- cut (Alsop) and New York (Low) smuggler-mil- lionaires under the Russell (and British) aus- pices. . . . Samuel and William Huntington Russell were quiet, wary builders of their faction's pow- er. An intimate colleague of opium gangster 611 Samuel Russell wrote this about him:"},{"pageNumber":737,"pageContent":"\"While he lived no friend of his would ven- ture to mention his name in print While in Chi- na, he lived for about twenty-five years almost as a hermit, hardly known outside of his factory [the Canton warehouse compound] except by the chosen few who enjoyed his intimacy, and by his good friend, Hoqua [Chinese security di- rector for the East India Company], but study- ing commerce in its broadest sense, as well as its minutest details.

Yale was the northern college favored by southern slaveowning would-be aristocrats. Among Yale's southern students were John C. Calhoun, later the famous South Carolina de- fender of slavery against nationalism, and Ju- dah P. Benjamin, later secretary of state for the slaveowners' Confederacy. . . . In 1832-33, Skull and Bopes was launched un- der the Russell pirate flag.

Alphonso Taft was a Bonesman alongside William H. Russell in the Class of 1833. As U.S. attorney general in 1876-97, Alphonso Tan helped organize the backroom settlement of the deadlocked 1876 presidential election. The bargain gave Rutherford B. Hayes the presiden- cy (18T1-81) and withdrew tlie U.S. troops from the South, where they had been enforcing blacks' rights. Alphonso's son, William Howard Taft (S&B 18781, was U.S. President from 1909 to 1913.

Harvey's other son, MeGeorge Bundy (SdrB' 1940) coauthored Stim- son's memoirs in 1948.

William Sloane Coffin was famous in the Vietnam War protest days as a leader of the left protest against the war. Was the fact that he was an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency embarrassing to William Sloane? This was no contradiction. His uncle, the Rev- erend Henry Sloane Coffin (S&B 18971, had also been a \"peace\" agitator, and an oligarchical agent Uncle Henry was for 20 years president of the Union Theological Seminary, whose board chairman was Prescott Bush's partner Thatcher Brown. In 1937, Henry Coffin and John Foster Dulles led the U.S. delegation to En- gland to found the World Council of Churches, as a \"peace movementn guided by the pro-Hitler faction in England. Thecoffins have been mainstays of the liber- al death lobby for euthanasia and eugenics. The Coffins outlasted Hitler, amving into the CIA in 1950s. Amory Howe Bradford (S&B 1934) married Carol Warburg Rothschild in 1941. Carol's mother, Carola, was the acknowledged head of the Warburg family in America after World War 11. This family had assisted the Harrimans' rise into the world in the nineteenth and early twen- tieth centuries;'in concert with the Sulzbergen at the New York Tima they had used.t&eir: American Jewish Committee and B'nai Brith to protect the Harriman-Bush deals with Hitler.

Though a Democrat (who spoke knowingly of the \"parallel governmentn operating in Iran- Contra), Boren's Intelligence Committee rul- ings have been (not unexpectedly) more and more favorable to his \"Patriarchn in the White House. Among the traditional artifacts the Skulland collected and maintained within the High Street Tomb are human remains ofvarious der- ivations. The following concerns one such set of Skull and Bones. Geronimo, an Apache faction leader and war- rior, led a party of wamors on a raid in 1876, 0 after Apaches were moved to the San Carlos Reservation in Arizona territory. He led other ' raids against U.S. and Mexican forces well into the 1880s; he was captured and escaped many times. Geronimo became a farmer and joined a Christian congregation. He died at the age of 79 years in 1909, and was buried at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Threequarters of a century later, his tribesmen raised the question of getting their famous warrior reinterred back in Ar- izona. Ned Anderson was Tribal Chairman of the San Carlos Apache Tribe from 1978 to 1986. This is the story he tellsD: Around the fall of 1983, the leader of an Apache group in another section of Arizona said he was interested in having the remains of Geronimo returned to his tribe's custody. Tak- ing up this idea, Anderson said that the remains properly belonged to his group as much as to the other Apaches. Afbr much d@cussion, sev- eral Apache groups, met$at's'khd ,of summit meeting held at'Fort Sill; Oklahoma. The army authorities were not favorable to the meeting, and it only occurred through the intervention of the office of the Governor of Oklahoma As a result ofthis meeting, Ned Anderson was written up in the newspapers as an articulate Apache activist Soon afterwards, in late 1983 or early 1984, a Skull and Bones member con- tacted Anderson and leaked evidence that Ge- ronimo's remains had long ago been pilfered- by Prescott Bush, George's father. The infor- mant said that in May of 1918, PrescoU Bush and five other oficers at Fort Sill desecrated the grave of Geronimo. They took turns on guard while they robbed the grave. taking items in- cluding a skull, some other bones, a horse bit and straps. These prizes were taken back to the Tomb, the home of the Skull and Bones Society at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut They were put into a display case, which members and visitors could easily view upon entry to the building. The informant provided Anderson with phw tographs of the stolen remains, and a copy of a Skull and Bones log book in which the 1918 grave robbery had been recorded. The infor- mant said that Skull and Bones members used the pilfered remains in performing some of their Thursday and Sunday night rituals, with Geronimo's skull sitting out on a table in front of them.. . . Through an attorney, Anderson asked the FBI to move into the case. The attorney con- veyed to him the Bureau's response: If he would turn over every scrap of evidence to the FBI, and completely remove himself from the case. they would get involved. He rejected this bar- gain, since it did not seem likely toiead towards recovery of Geronimo's remains. Due to his persistence. he was able to arrange a September, 1986 Manhattan meeting with Jon- athan Bush, George Bush's brother. Jonathan Bush vaguely assured Anderson that he would get what he had come after, and set a followup meeting for the next day. But Bush stalled- Anderson believes this was to gain time to hide and secure the stolen remains against any pos- sible rescue action."},{"pageNumber":741,"pageContent":"The Skull and Bones attorney representing the Bush family and managing the case was En- dicott Peabody Davison. His father was the F. Trubee Davison mentioned above, who had been president of New York's American Muse- um of Natural History, and personnel director for the Central Intelligence Agency. The atti- tude of this Museum crowd has long been that \"Natives\" should be stuffed and mounted for display to the Fashionable Set Finally, after about 11 days, another meeting occurred. A display case was produced, which did in fact match the one in the photograph the informant had given to Anderson. But the skull he was shown was that of a ten-year-old child, and Anderson refused to receive it or to sign a legal document promising to shut up about the matter. Anderson took his complaint to Arizona Con- gressmen Morris Udall and John McCain III, but with no results. George Bush refused Con- gressman McCain's request that he meet with Anderson Anderson wrote to Udall, enclosing a photo- graph of the wall case and slrull at the \"Tomb,\" showing a black and white photograph of the living Geronimo, which members of the Order had boastfully posted. next to their display of his skull. Anderson quoted from a Skull and Bones Society internal history, entitled Contin- wtion dthe History of Our Chrler fm the Centuq Celebmtion, 17 June 1333, by The tittle Devil of D'121. \"From the war days [W.W. Il also sprang the mad expedition from the School of Fire at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, that brought to the T[omb] its most spectacular 'crook,' the skull of Geronimo the temble, the Indian Chief who had taken forty-nine white scalps. An expedition in late May, 1918, by members of four [graduating-class years of the Society], Xit D.114, Barebones, Cali- ban and Dingbat, D.115, S'Mike D.116, and Hell- bender D.117, planned with great caution since in the words of one of them: 'Six army captains 'robbing a grave wouldn't look good in the papem' The stirring climax was recorded by Hellben- der in the Black Book of D.117: '. . . The ring of' pick on stone and thud of earth on earth alone disturbs the peace of the prairie. An axe pried open the iron door of the tomb, and Pattriarchl Bush entered and started to dig. We dug in turn, each on relief taking a turn on the road as guards. . . . Finally Payriarch] Ellery James turned up a bridle, soon a saddle horn and rot- ten leathers followed, then wood and then, at the exact bottom of the small round hole, Pauri- arch] James dug deep and pried out the trophy itself. . . . ' We quickly closed the grave, shut the door and sped home to PaUriarchl Mallon's room, where we cleaned the Bones. Payriarchl Mal- lon sat on the floor liberally applying carbolic acid. The Skull was fairly clean, having only some flesh inside and a little hair. I showered and hit the hay.. . a happy man.. . .\"\" The other grave robber whose name is given, Ellery James, we encountered in Chapter One-he was to be an usher at'Prescott's wed- ding three years later. And the fellow who ap plied acid to the stolen skull, burning off the 0esh and hair, was Neil Mallon. Years later, Prescott Bush and his partners chose Mallon as chairman of Dresser Industries; Mallon hired Prescott's son. George Bush, for George's first job; and George Bush named his son, Neil Mal- lon Bush, after the flesh-picker. In 1988 the Washington Post ran an article entitled \"Skull for Scandal: Did Bush's Father Rob Geronimo's Grave?\" There was a small quote from the 1933 Skull and Bones Histg( of Our Order: \"An axe pried open the iron door of the tomb, and . . . Bush entered and started to dig. . . .\" and so forth, but neglected to include other names beside Bush. According to the Washington Post, the docu- ment which Bush attorney Davison tried to get the Apache leader to sign, stipulated that An- derson agreed it would be \"inappropriate for you, me [Jonathan Bush] or anyone in associa- tion with us to make or permit any publication in connection with this transaction!' Anderson called the document \"very insulting to Indi- ans.\" Davison claimed later that the Order's own history book is a hoax, but duringthe nego- tiations with Anderson, Bush's attorney de- manded Anderson give up his copy of the boob\" Bush crony Fitzhugh Green gives the view of the President's backers on this affair, and conveys the arrogagt racial attitude typical of Skull and Bones: \"Prescott Bush had a colorful side. In 1988 the press revealed the complai_nt of an Apache leader about Bush. This was Ned Anderson of San Carlos, Oklahoma [sic], who charged that as a young army officer Bush stole the skull of Indian Chief [sic] Geronimo and had it hung on the wall of Yale's Skull and Bones Club. Alter exposure of 'true facts' by Anderson, and con- sideration by some representatives in Con- gress, the issue faded from public sight Wheth- er or not this alleged skullduggery actually oc- curred, the mcn idea casts the senior Bush in an adventurn Iightn\" [emphasis added]. George Bush's crowning as a Bonesman was intensely, personally important to him. . . . Survivors of his 1948 Bones group were inter- viewed for a 1988 Washington Post campaign profile of George Bush. The members described their continuing intimacy with and financial support for Bush up through his 1980s vice pres- idency. Their original sexual togetherness at Yale is stressed: The relationships that w6re formeid in the \"Tomb\". . . where the Society's meetings took place each Thursday and Sunday night dur- ing the academic year, have had a strong place in Bush's life, according to all 11 of his fellow Bonsemen who are still alive. Several described in detail the ritual in the oganization that builds the bonds. Before giving his life history, each member had to spend a Sunday night reviewing his sex life in a talk known in theTomb as CB, orUconnubial blissn. . . . \"The first time you review your sex life.. . .

'Bush Opened Up To Secret Yale Society,\" Washington Past, August 7. 1988 The Permian Basin Gang, 1948-59 Pecunia non olet [Money doesn't smell] - Vespasian D uring the years following the Second World War, the patrician families of the Eastern Anglophile Liberal Establish- ment sent numbers of their offspring to colo- nize those geographic regions of the United States which, the families estimated, were like- ly to prosper .in the postwar period. On the sur- face, this appears as a simple reflex of greed: Cadet sons were dispatched to those areas of the provinces where their instinctive methods of speculation and usury could be employed to parasitize emerging wealth. More fundamen- tally, this migration of young patrician bankers answered the necessity of political control. The Eastern Establishment, understood as an agglomeration of financier factions head- quartered in Wall Street, had been the domi- nant force in American politics since J.P. Mor- gan had bail-ed . . out the Grover Cleveland regime in the 1890s. Since the assassination of William McKinley and the advent of Theodore Roose- , velt, the power of the Wall Street group had grown continuously. The Eastern Establish- ment may have had its earliest roots north of Boston and in the Hudson River Valley, but it was determined to be, not a mere regional fi- nancier faction, but the undisputed ruling elite of the United States as a whole, from Boston to Bohemian Grove and from Palm Beach to the Pacific Northwest It was thus imperative that the constant tendency toward the formation of regional factions be preempted by the perva- sive presence of men bound by blood loyalty to the dominant cliques ofwashington, New York, and the \"mother country,\" the City of London. If the Eastern Liberal Establishment were thought of as a cancer, then aRer 1945 that can- cer went into a new phase of malignant metasta- sis, infecting every part of the American body politic. George Bush was one of those motile, malignant cells. He was not alone: Robert Mos- bacher also made the journey from ~ew ~ork to Texas, in'Mosbacher's case directly to Houston. The various sycophant mythographers who have spun their yams about the life of George Bush have always attempted to present this phase of Bush's life as the case of a fiercely independent young man who could have gone straight to the top in Wall Street by trading on father Prescott's name and connections, but who chose instead to strike out for the new fron- tier among the wildcatters and roughnecks of the west Texas oil fields and become a self- made man. As George Bush himself recounted in a 1983 interview, \"If I were a psychoanalyzer, I might conclude that I was trying to, not compete with my father, but do something on my own. My stay in Texas was no Horatio Alger thing, but moving from New Haven to Odessa just about the day I graduated was quite a shiR in lifestyle.\"' These fairy tales from the \"red Studebaker\" school seek to obscure the facts: that Bush's transfer to Texas was arranged from the top by Prescott's Brown Brothers Hamman cronies, 'and thatevetp.step.forw;rrd!made.by~Bush in .-. , the oil business was assisted by the capital re- sources of our hero's maternal uncle, George Herbert Walker, Jr., \"Uncle Herbie,\" the boss of G.H. Walker & Co. investment firm of Wall Street Uncle Herbie had graduated from Yale in 1927, where he had been a member of Skull and Bones. This is the Uncle Herbie who will show up as lead investor and member of the board of Bush-Overbey oil, of Zapata Petra- leum, and of Zapata Offshore aRer 1959.. : Father Prescott procured George not one job. but two, in each case contacting cronies who depended at least partially on Brown Brothers Hamman for business. One crony contacted by father Prescott was Ray Knvis, who was in the oil business in Tulsa, Oklahoma Oklahoma had experienced a colos- sal oil boom between the two world wars, and Ray Kravis had cashed in, building up a person- al fortune of some $25 million. Ray was the son of a British tailor whose father had come to America and set up a haberdashery in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Young Ray Kravis had amved in Tulsa in 1925, in the midst of the oil boom"},{"pageNumber":743,"pageContent":"that was making the colossal fortunes of men like J. Paul Getty. Ray Kravis was primarily a tax accountant, and he had invented a very spe- cial tax shelter which allowed oil properties to be \"packagedn and sold in such a way as to reduce the tax on profits earned from the nor- mal oil property rate of 81 percent to a mere 15 percent This meant that the national tax base was eroded, and each individual taxpayer bilked, in order to subsidize the formation of immense private fortunes; this will be found to be a constant theme among George Bush's business associates down to the present day. Ray Kravis's dexterity in setting up these tax shelters attracted the attention of Joseph P. Kennedy, the bucaneering bootlegger, entre- preneur, political boss and patriarch of the Massachusetts Kennedy clan. For many years Ray Kravis functioned as the manager of the Kennedy family fortune (or fondo), the same job that later devolved to Stephen Smith. Ray Kravis and Joe Kennedy both wintered in Palm Beach, where they were sometimes golf partners? In 1948-49, father Prescott was the managing partner of Brown Brothers Harriman. Prescott knew Ray Kravis as a local Tulsa finance mogul and wheelerdealer, who was oRen called upon by Wall Street investment houses as a consul- tant to evaluate the oil reserves of various corn- - panies. The estimates that Ray Kravis provided 0th involved the amount of oil in the ground that these firms possessed, and these estimates went to the heart of the oil business as aground- rent exploitation in which current oil produc- tion was far less important than the reserves still beneath the soil. Such activity imparted the kind of primitive- accumulation mentality that was later seen to animate Ray Kravis's son Henry. During the 1980s, as we will see, Henry Kravis personally generated some $58 billion in debt for the pur- pose of aequiring36 companies and assembling the largest corporate empire, in paper terms, of all time. Henry Kravis would be one of the leaders of the leveraged buyout gang which be- came a mainstay of the political machine of George Bush. . . . So father Prescott asked Ray if he had a job for young George. The answer was, of course he did. : But in the meantime, ~rescott Bush had also been talking'with another crony beholden to him, Henry Neil Mallon, who was the president and chairmaa.of the board of Dresser Indus- .tries., a leading manpfacturer of drill .bits and related oil well drilling equipment Dresser had been incorporated in 1905 by Solomon R Dresser, but had been bought up and reorga- nized by W.A. Harriman & Co. in 1928-29. Henry Neil Mallon, for whom the infamous Neil Mallon Bush of Hinckley and Silverado fame is named, came from a Cincinnati family who were traditional retainers for the TaRclan, in the same way that the Bush-Walker family were retainers for the Hammans. As a child, Neil Mallon had gone with his family to visit their close friends, President William Howard TaR and his family, at the White House. Mallon had then attended the TaR SChool in Water- town. Connecticut, and had gone on to Yale Uni- versity in the fall of 1913, where he met Bunny Harriman, Prescott Bush, Knight Wooley, and the other Bonesmen. As we recall from the previous chapter: the society's internal history boasted that in 1918, Mallon burned the flesh and hair off the skull of Geronimo, which Prescott Bush and his friends stole from the despoiled grave at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. One day in December 1928, Bunny Harriman, father Prescott and Knight Wooley were sitting around the Harriman counting house dis- cussing their reorganization of Dresser Indus- tries. Mallon, who was returning to Ohio after six months spent mountaineering in the Alps, came by to visit At a certain point in the conver- sation, Bunny pointed to Mallon and exclaimed, \"Dresser! Dresser!\" Mallon was subsequently interviewed by George Herbert Walker, the president of W.A. Harriman & Co. As a result of this interview, Mallon was immediately made president of Dresser, although he had no expe- rience in the oil business. Mallon clearly owed ,ae Walker-Bush clan some favors.' Prescott Bush had become a member of the board of directors of Dresser Industries in.1930, in the wake of the reorganization of the compa- ny, which he had personally helped to direct Prescott Bush was destined to remain on the Dresser board for 22 years, until 1952, when he entered the United States Senate. Father Prescott was thus calling in a chit which pro- cured George a second job offer, this time with Dresser Industries or one of its subsidiaries. George Bush knew that the oil boom in Okla- homa had passed.its peak, and that Tulsa would no longer offer the sterling opportunities for a fast buck it had presented 20 years earlier. Dresser, by contrast, was a vast international corporation, ideally suited to gaining a rapid overview of the oil industry and its looting prac- tices. George Bush accordingly called Ray Kravis and, in the ingratiating tones he was wont to use as he clawed his way toward the top, said that he wished respectfully to decline the job that Kravis had offered him in Tulsa. His first preference was to go to work for Dress- er. Ray Kravis, who looked to Prescott for busi- ness, released him at once. ,uI'know George Bush well,\" said Ray Kravis years later. \"I've known him since he got out of school. His father was a very good friend of mine.\" Bush in Odessa . This is the magic moment in which all the official Bush biographies show our hero riding into Odessa, Texas in the legendary red Stude- baker, to take up a post as an equipment clerk and trainee for the Dresser subsidiary IDECO (International Derrick and Equipment Company). . . But.the red ~tudebaker myth, as-aeady not; ed, misrepresents the facts. According to the semi-official history of Dresser Industries, George Bush was first employed by Dresser at their corporate headquarters in Cleveland, , Ohio, where he worked for Dresser executive RE Reimer, an ally of Mallon.\" This stint in Cleveland is hardly mentioned by the pro-Bush biographers, . making . us wonder what is being"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"covered up. On the same page that relates these interesting facts, there is a picture that shows father Prescott, Dorothy, Barbara Bush, and George holding his infant son George Walker Bush. Young George W. is wearing cowboy boots. They are all standing in front of a Dresser Industries executive airplane, apparently a , DC-3. Could this be the way George really ar- rived in Odessa? The Dresser history also has George Bush working for Pacific Pumps, another Dresser subsidiary, before finally joining IDECO. Ac- cording to Bush's campaign autobiography, he had been with IDECO for a year in Odessa, Tex- as before being transferred to work for Pacific Pumps in Huntington Park and Bakersfield, California. Bush says he worked at Huntington Park as an assemblyman, and it was here that he claims to have joined the United Steelworkers Union, obtaining a union card that he will still pull out when confronted for his long histoty of union-busting, as for example when he was heckled at a shipyard in Portland, Oregon dur- ing the 1988 campaign. Other accounts place Bush in Ventura, Compton and \"Richard Nix- on's home town of Whittier\" during this same period? - If Bush actually went -9 California first'and only later to Odessa, he .ay be lying in order to stress that he chose Texas as his first choice, a distortion that may have been concocted'very early in his political career to defend himself against the constant charge that he was a car- petbagger. Odessa,Texas, and the nearby city ofMidland were both located in the geological formation known as the Permian Basin, the scene .of an oil boom that developed in the years after the Second World War. Odessa at this time was a complex of yards and warehouses, where oil drilling equipment was brought for distribu- tion to the oil rigs that were drilling all over the landscape. At IDECO, Bush worked for supervisor Bill Nelson, and had one Hugh Evans among his co- workers. Concerning.this period, we are re galed with stories about how Bush and Barbara moved into a shotgun house, an apartment that had been divided by a partition down the mid- dle, with a bathroom they shared with a mother and daughter prostitute - -am. There was a per- vasive odor of gas, whics came not from a leak in the oven, but from nearby oil wells where the gas was flared off. George and Barbara were to spend some time slumming in this setting. But Bush was anxious to ingratiate himselfwith the roughnecks and roustabouts; he began eating the standard Odessa diet of a bowl of chili with crackers and beer for lunch, and chicken-fried steak for dinner. Perhaps his affected liking for country and western music and pork rinds, and other public relations ploysgo backto this time. Bush is also fond of recounting the story of how, on Christmas Eve, 1948, he got drunk during various IDECO customer receptionsand passed out, dead drunk, on his own front lawn, where he was found by Barbara. George Bush, we can see, is tndy a regular guy.

Some months later they moved to Midland. another tumbleweed town in west Texas. Midland offered the advantage of being the location of the west Texas headquarters of many ofthe oil companies that operated in Ode- ssa and the surrounding area . . . The Bush social circle in Odessa was hardly composed of oil field roughnecks. Rather, their peer group was composed more of the sorts of people they had known in New Haven: a clique of well-heeled recent graduates of prestigious eastern colleges who had been attracted to the Permian Basin in the same way that Stanford, Hopkins, Crocker and their ilk were attracted to San Francisco during the gold rush. Here were Toby Hilliard, John Ashmun, and Pomer- oy Smith, all from Princeton. Earle Craig had been at Yale. Midland thus boasted a Yale Club and a Harvard Club and a Princeton Club. The natives referred to this clique as \"the Yalies.\" Also present on the scene in Midland were J. Hugh Liedtke and William LiedUte, who had grown up in Oklahoma, but who had attended college at Amherst in Massachusetts. Many of these individuals had access to patri- cian fortunes back East for the venture capital they mobilized behind their various deals. Toby Hilliard's full name was Harry Talbot Hil- lid of Fox Chapel near Pittsburgh, where the Mellons had their palatial residence. hrle Cnig was also hooked up to b~g money in he same area. The Liedtke brothers, as we will see, had connections to the big oil money that had emerged around Tulsa. Many of these \"Yalies\" also lived in the Easter Egg Row neighborhood. A few houses away from George Bush there lived a certain John Overbey. According to Ov- erbey, the \"people from the East and the people from Texas or Oklahoma all seemed to have two things in common. They all had a chance to be stockbrokers or investment bankers.

How many Texas ranchers can remember selling their mineral rights for a pittance to smiling George Bush, and then having oil dis- covered on the land, oil from which their family would never earn a penny? Across the street from Bush-Overbey were the offices of Liedtke & Liedtke, Attorneys-at- law. J. Hugh Liedtke and William Liedtke were from Tulsa, Oklahoma, where they, like Bush, had grown up rich, as the sons of a local judge who had become one of the top corporate law- yers for Gulf Oil. The Liedtkes' grandfather had come from Prussia, but had served in the Con- federate Army. J. Hugh Liedtke had found time along the way to acquire the notorious Haward Master of Business Administration degree in one year. ARer service in the Navy during World War 11, the Liedtkes obtained law de- grees at the University of Texas law School, where they rented the servants' quarters of the home of U.S. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, who was away in Washington most of the time.. . The Liedtkes combined the raw, uncouth primitive accumulation mentality of the oil boom town with the refined arts of usury and speculation as Harvard taught them. Their law ~ractice was such in name only; their primary schemed and schemed until he had found a way to go beyond hustling for royalty leases: He con- cocted a method of trading oil-producing prop erties in such a way as to permit the eventual owner to defer all tax liabilities until the field was depleted. Sometimes Hugh Liedtke would commute between Midland and Tulsa on an al- most daily basis. He would spend the daylight hours prowling the Permian Basin for a land deal, make the 13-hour drive to Tulsa overnight to convince his backers to ante up the cash, and then race back to Midland to close the deal before the sucker got away. It was during this phase that it occurred to Liedtke that he could save himself a lot of marathon commuter driv- ing if he could put together a million dollars in venture capital and \"inventory\" the deals he was otherwise forced to make on a piecemeal, ad hoc basis.''

Following in the footsteps of economy of the 1980s, the Liedtke brothers and his fellow Tulsan Ray Kravis, Hugh Liedtke George Bush decided to pool their capital and 0621"},{"pageNumber":747,"pageContent":"their rapacious talents by going into business together. Overbey was on board initially, but would soon fall away. The year was 1953, and Uncle Herbie's G.H. Walker &Co. became the principal underwriter of the stock and convertible debentures that were to be offered to the public. Uncle Herbie would also purchase a large portion of the stock himself. When the new company required fur- ther infusions of capital, Uncle Herbie would float the necessary bonds. Jimmy Gammell re-. mained a key participant and would find a seat on the board of directors of the new company. Another of the key investors was the Clark Fam- ily Estate, meaning the trustees who managed the Singer Sewing machine fortune.\" Some oth- er money came from various pension funds and endowments, sources that would become very popular during the leveraged buyout orgy Bush presided over in the 1980s. Of the capital of the new Bush-Liedtke concern, about $500,000 would come from Tulsa cronies of the Liedtke brothers, and the other $500,000 from the cir- cles of Uncle Herbie. The latter were referred to by Hugh Liedtke as \"the New York guys.\" The name chosen for the new concern was Zapah Petroleum. According to Hugh Liedtke, the new entrepreneurs were attracted to the name when they saw it on a movie marquee, where the new release Vim Zapatu!, starring .Marlon Brando as the Mexican revolutionary, was playing. Liedtke characteristically ex- plains that part of the appeal of the name was the confusion as to whether Zapata had been a patriot or a banditU The Bush-Liedtke combination concentrated its attention on an oil property in Coke County called Jameson Field, a barren expanse of prai- rie and sagebrush where six widely separated wells had been producing oil for some years. . Hugh Liedtke was convinced that these six oil wells were tapping into a single underground pool of oil, and that dozens or even hundreds of new oil wells drilled into the same field would all prove to be gushers. In other words, Liedtke wanted to gamble the entire capita1 of the new firm on the hypothesis that the wells were, in oil parlance, \"connected.\" One of Liedtke's Tulsa backers was supposedly unconvinced, and ar- gued that the wells were too far apart; they could not possibly connect \"Goddamn, they do!\" was Hugh Liedtke's rejoinder. He insisted on shooting the works in a va-banque operation. Uncle Herbie's circles were nervous: 'The New Yorkguys were just about to pee in their pants,\" boasted Leidtke years later. Bush and Hugh Liedtke obviously had the better information: The wells were connected, and 127 wells were drilled without encountering a single dry hole. As a result, the price of a share of stock in Zapa- ta went up from seven cents a share to $23. During this time, Hugh Liedtke collaborated on several small deals in the Midland area with a certain T. Boone Pickens, later one of the most notorious corporate.raiders of the 1980s. one of the originators of the \"greenmail\" strategy-of extortion, by which a raider would accumulate part of the shares of a company and threaten to go all the way to a hostile takeover unless the management of the company agreed to buy back those shares at an outrageous premium. Pick- ens is the buccaneer who was self-righteously indignant when the ~apanese business commu- nity attempted to prevent him from introducing , these shameless looting practices into the Japa- nese economy. Pickens, too, was a product of the ~uih-~iedt- ke social circle of Midland. When he was just getting started in the mid-fifties, Pickens want- ed to buy the Hugoton Production Company, which owned the Hugoton field, one of the world's great onshore deposits of natural gas. Pickens engineered the hostile takeover of Hu- goton by turning to,Hugh Liedtke to be intro- duced to the trustees of the Clark.Family Es- tate. who, as we have just seen, had put up part of the capital for Zapata. Pickens promised the Clark trustees a high& return than was being provided by the current management, and this support proved to be ,decisive in permitting Pickens's Mesa Petroleum to take over Hugo- ton, launching this corsair on a career of looting and pillage that still continues. In 1988, George Bush would give an interview to a magazine owned by Pickens in which the Vice President would defend hostile leveraged buyouts as nec- essary to the interests of the shareholders. In the meantime, after two to three years of operations, the oil flow out of.Zapata's key Jameson field had begun to slow down. Al- though there was still abundant oil in the ground, the natural.pressure had been rapidly depleted, so Bush and the Liedtkes had to begin resorting to stratagems in order to bring the oil to the surface. They began pumping water into the underground formations in order to force the oil to the surface. From then on, \"enhanced recovery\" techniques were necessary to keep the Jameson field on line. During 1955 and 1956, Zapata was able to re- port a small profit In 1957,the year of the incipi- ent Eisenhower recession, this turned into a loss of $155,183, as the oil from the Jameson field began to slow down. In 1958, the loss was $427,752, and in 1959; there was $207,742 of red ink 1960 (after Bush had departed from the scene) brought another loss, this time of $372,258. It was not until 1961 that Z~pata was able to post a small profit of $50,482. Despite the fact that Bush and the Liedtkes all became millionaires through the increased value of their shares, it was not exactly an enviable re- cord; without the deep pockets of Bush's Uncle Herbie Walker and his British backers, the en- tire venture might have foundered at an early date. Bush and the Liedtkes had been very lucky with the Jameson field, but they could hardly expect such results to be repeated indefinitely. In addition, they were now posting losses, and the value of Zapata stock had gone into a de- cline. Bush and the Liedtke brothers now con- cluded that the epoch in which large oil fields could be discovered within the continental United States was .over. Mammoth new oil fields. they believed, could only be found off- shore. located under hundreds of feet ofswater on the continental shelves, or in StlaUOW seas like the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. By a happy coincidence, in 1054 the U.S. fed- eral government was just beginning to auction the mineral rights for these offshore areas. With father Prescott Bush directing his potent"},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"Brown Brothers HarrimanlSkull and Bones net- work from the U.S. Senate while regularly hob nobbing with President Eisenhower on the golf links, George Bush could be confident ofreceiv- ing special privileged treatment when it came to these mineral rights. Bush and his partners therefore judged the moment ripe for launch- ing a for-hire drilling company, Zapata .OK- shore, a Delaware corporation that would offer its services to the companies making up the Seven Sisters international oil cartel in drilling underwater wells. Forty percent of the offshore company's stock would be owned by the origi- nal Zapata fin. The new company would also be a buyer of offshore royalty leases. Uncle Herbie helped arrange a new issue of stock for this Zapata offshoot The shares were easy to unload because of the 1954 boom in the New Yorfstock market \"The stockmarket lent itself to speculation,\" Bush would explain years lat- er, \"and you could get equity capital for new ventures.\"\" 1954 was also the year that the CIA overthrew the government of Jacobo Arbenz in Guatema- la. This was the beginning of a dense fluny of U.S. covert operations in Central America and the Caribbean, featuring especially Cuba The first asset of Zapata Offshore was tlie SCORPION. a $3.5 million deepsea drilling rig th t was financed by $1.5 million from the ini- 1 tia stock sale plus another $2 million from bonds marketed with the help of Uncle Herbie. The SCORPION was the first three-legged, self- elevating mobile drilling barge, and it was built by R G. LeTourneau, Inc. of Vicksburg, Missis sippi. The platform weighed some 9 million pounds and measured 180 by 150 feet, and the three legs were 140 feet long when fully extend- ed. The rig was floated into the desired drilling position before the legs were extended, and the main body was then pushed up above the waves by electric motors. The SCORPION was deliv- ered early in 1W, was commissfon_ed at Galves- ton in March, 1956 and was put to work at ex- ploratory drilling in the Gulf of Mexico during the rest of the year. During 1956, the Zapata Petroleum otRcers included J. Hugh Liedtke as president, George H.W. Bush asvice president, and William Bnm- ley of Midland, Texas, as treasurer. The board of directors lined up as follows: George H.W. Bush, Midland, Texas; J.G.S. Gammell. Edinburgh, Scotland, man- ager of British Assets Trust, Ltd.; J. Hugh Liedtke, Midland, Texas; William C.

An interim director that year had been Rich- ard E. Fleming of Robert Fleming and Co., Lon- don, England.

This was a combination of gas and oil, and one well was.rated at 113 bar- rels of distillate and 3.6 million cubic feet of gas per day.\" This was especially remunera- tive, because Zapata had acquired a half-inter- est in the royalties from any oil orgas that might be found. VINEGAROON then continued to drill offshore from Vermilion Parish, Louisi- : ana, on a farmout from Continental Oil. . As for the SCORPION, during part of 1957 it was under contract to the Bahama-California Oil Company, drilling between Florida and Cuba. It was then leased by Gulf Oil and Stan- dard Oil of California, on whose behalf it start- ed drilling during 1958 at a position on the Cay Sal Bank, 131 miles south of Miami, Florida, and just 54 miles north of Isabela, Cuba Cuba was an interesting place just then; the US.- backed insurgency of Fidel Castro was rapidly undermining the older US.-imposed regime of Fulgencio Batista That meant that SCORPION was located at a hot comer. We note that Allen Dulles, then director of the Central Intelli- gence Agency, had previously been legal coun- sel to Gulf Oil for Latin American operations, and counsel to George Bush's father at Brown Brothers Harriman for eastern Europe. During 1957 a certain divergence began to appear between Uncle Herbie Walker, Bush, and the \"New York guysw on the one hand, and the Liedtke brothers and their Tulsa backers on the other.

A body of leads has been assembled which suggests that George Bush may have been asso- ciated with the CIA at some time before the autumn of 1963. According to Joseph McBride of The Nation, \"a source with close connections to the intelligence community confirms that Bush started working for the agency in 1960 or 1961, using his oil business as a cover for clan- destine activities.\"' By the time of the Kennedy assassination, we have an official FBI docu- ment which refers to \"Mr. George Bush of the Central Intelligence Agency.\" and despite offi- cial disclaimers, there is every reason to think that this is indeed the man in the White House today. The mystery of George Bush as a possible covert operator hinges on four points, each one of which represents one of the great political and espionage scandals of postwar American history. These four cardinal points are: 1. The abortive Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, launched on April 16-17, 1961, prepared with the assistance of the CIA'S \"Miami Station\" (also known under the code name JM/WAVE). After the failure of the amphibious landings of Brigade 2506, Miami station, under the leader- ship of Theodore Shackley, became the focus for Operation Mongoose, a series of covert oper- ations directed against Castro, Cuba, and possi- bly other targets. 2 The assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas on November 22,1963, and the coverup of those responsible for this crime. 3. The Watergate scandal, beginning with an April 1971 visit to Miami, Florida by E. Howard Hunt on the tenth anniversary of the Bay of Pigs invasion to recruit operatives forthe White House Special Investigations Unit(the '!Plumb- ers\" and later Watergate burglars) from among Cuban-American Bay of Pigs veterans. 4. The Iran-Contra affair, which became a public scandal during October-November 1986, several of whose central figures, such as Felix Rodriguez, were also veterans of the Bay of Pigs. George Bush's role in both Watergate and the October Surprisefiran-Contra complex will be treated in detail at later points in this book Right now, it is important tosee that thirty years of covert operations, in many respects, form a single continuous whole. This is especially true in regard to the dmmatis personae. Georgie 'Anne Geyer points to the obvious in a recent book: \" . . . an entire new Cuban cadre now emerged from the Bay of Pigs. The names How- ard Hunt, Bernard Barker, Rolando Martinez, Felix Rodriguez and Eugenio Martinez would, in the next quarter century, pop up, often deci- sively, over and over again in the most danger- ous American foreign policy crises. There were Cubans flying missions for the CIA.in the Congo and even for the Portuguese in Africa; Cubans were the burglars of Watergate; Cubans played key roles in Nicaragua, in Irangate, -in the 0 6 American move into the Persian GulLnZ Felix Rodriguez tells us that he was infiltrated into Cuba with the other members of the \"Grey Team\" in conjunction with the Bay ofpigs land- ings; this is the same man we will find directing the Contra supply effort in Central America during the 1980s, working under the direct su- pervision of Don Gregg and George Bush?Theo- dore Shackley, the JMtWAVE station chief, will later show up in Bush's 1979-80 presidential campaign. To a very large degree, such covert opera- tions have drawn upon the same pool of person- nel. They are to a significant extent the handi- work of the same crowd. It is therefore reveal- ing to extrapolate forward and backward in time the individuals and groups of individuals who appear as the cast of characters in one scandal, and compare them with the cast of characters for the other scandals, including the secondary ones that have not been enumerated here. E. Howard Hunt, for example, shows up as a confirmed part of the overthrow ofthe Gua- temalan government of Jacopo Arbenz in 1951, as an important part of the chain of command in the Bay of Pigs, as a person repeatedly ac- cused of having been in Dallas on the day Ken- nedy was shot, and as one of the central figures of Watergate. George Bush is demonstrably one of the most important protagonists of the Watergate scan- dal, and was the overall director of Iran-Contra. Since he appears especially in Iran-Contra in close proximity to Bay of Pigs holdovers, it is surely legitimate to wonder when his associa- tion with those Bay of Pigs Cubans might have started. 1959 was the year that Bush started operating out of his Zapata Offshore headquarters in Houston; it was also the year that Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba. Officially, as we have seen, George was now a businessman whose work took him at times to Louisiana, where Za- pata had offshore drilling operations. George must have been a frequent visitor to New Or- leans. Because of his family's estate on Jupiter Island, he would also have been a frequent visi- tor to the Iiobe Sound area. And then, there were Zapata Offshore drilling operations in the Florida strait The Jupiter Island connection and father Prescott's Brown Brothers HarrimanlSkull and Bones networks are doubtless the key. Jupiter Island meant Averell Harriman, Robert Lovett, C. Douglas Dillon and other Anglophile .finan- ciers who had directed the U.S. intelligence community long before there had been a CIA at all.

Kennedy sought to procure an outside, expert opinion on military matters. For this he turned to the former commander in chief of the Southwest Pacific Theatre during World War 11, General Douglas MacArthur. Al- most ten years ago, a reliable source shared with one of the authors an account of a meeting between Kennedy and MacArthur in which the veteran general warned the young President that there were elements inside the U.S. gov- ernment who emphatically did not share his patriotic motives, and who were seeking to de- stroy his administration from within. MacAr- thur warned that the forces bent on destroying Kennedy were centered in the Wall Street fi- nancial community and its various tentacles in the intelligence community. It is a matter of public record that Kennedy met with MacArthur in the latter. part of April 1961, after the Bay of Pigs. According to Kenne- dy aide Theodore Sorenson, MacArthur told Kennedy, The chickens are coming home to roost, and you happen to have just moved into the chicken house.'* At the same meeting, ac- cording to Sorenson, MacArthur \"warned [Ken- nedy] against the commitment of American foot soldiers on the Asian mainland, and the Presi- dent never forgot this advice.\" lo This point is, grudgingly confirmed by Arthur M. Schlesinger. a Kennedy aide who had a vested interest in vilifying MacArthur, who wrote that \"MacAr- thur expressed his old view that anyone want- ing to commit American ground forces to the mainland [of Asia] should have his head exam- ined.\"'! MacArthur restated this advice during a second meeting with Kennedy when the Gen- eral returned from his last trip to the Far'East in July 1961. ' Kennedy valued MacArthur's professional military opinion highly, and used it to keep at arms length those advisers who were arguing for escalation in Laos, Vietnam, and elsewhere. He repeatedly invited those who proposed to send land forces to Asia to convince MacArthur that this was a good idea. Ifthey could convince MacArthur, then he, Kennedy, might also go along. At this time, the group proposing escalation in Vietnam (as well as preparing the assassina- tion of President Diem) had a heavy Brown Brothers HarrimanlSkull and Bones overtone: The hawks of 196143 were Harriman, McGeorge Bundy, William Bundy, Henry Cabot Lodge, and some key London oligarchs and theoreticiansof counterinsurgency wars. And of course, George Bush during these years was calling for escala- tion in Vietnam and challenging Kennedy to \"muster the courage'! to try a second invasion - of Cuba. In the meantime, the JMlWAVE-Miami sta- tion complex was growing rapidly to become the largest of Langley's many satellites. During the years after the failure of the Bay of Pig, this complex had as many as 3.000 Cuban agents and subagents, with a small army of case offi- cers to direct and look after each one. Ac- cording to one account, there . were e at least 55 dummy corporations to provide employment, cover, and commercial disguise for all these operatives. There were detective bureaus, gun stores, real estate brokerages, boat repair shops, and party boats for fishing and other en- tertainments. There was the clandestine Radio Swan, later renamed Radio Americas. There were fleets of specially modified.boats based at Homestead Marina, and at other marinas throughout the Florida Keys. Agents were as- signed to the University of Miami and other educational institutions. The raison d'@tre of the massive capability commanded by Theodore Shackley was now Op eration Mongoose, a program for sabotage raids and assassinations to be conducted on Cuban territory, with a special effort to eliminate Fi- del Castro.personally.

Documents regarding the in- corporation of businesses were falsified. In- come tax returns were faked. FM regulations were violated by planes taking off for Cuba or for forward bases in the Bahamas and else- where. Explosives moved across highways that were full of civilian traffic. The Munitions Act, the Neutrality Act, the customs and immigra- tions laws were routinely flaunted.* Above all, the drug laws were massively vie lated as the @llant anticommunist fighters filled their planes and boats with illegal narcot- ics to be smuggled back into the United States when they returned from their missions. By 1963, the drug-running activities of the covert operatives were beginning to attract attention. JMMTAVE, in sum, accelerated the slide of south Fiorida towards the status of drug and murder capital of the United States it achieved during the 1980s. The Kennedy Assassination It cannot be the task of this study even to begin to treat the reasons for which certain leading elements of the AngleAmerican fi- nancial oligarchy, perhaps acting with certain kinds of support from continental European aristocratic and neofascist networks, ordered the murder ofJohn F. Kennedy. The British and the Hammanites wanted escalation in Viet- nam; by the time of his assassination Kennedy was committed to a pullout of U.S. forces. Ken- nedy, as shown by his American University speech of 1963, was also interested in seeking a more stable path of war avoidance with the Soviets, using the U.S. military superiority demonstrated during the Cuban missile crisis to convince Moscow to accept a policy of world peace through economic development Kenne- dy was interested in the possibilities of anti- missile strategic defense to put an end to that nightmare of Mutually Assured Destruction which appealed to Henry Kissinger, a disgnrn- tled former employee of the Kennedy adminis- tration whom the President had denounced as a madman."},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"since the final days of Roosevelt Kennedy fur- thermore had two younger brothers who might succeed him, putting a strong presidency be- yond the control of the the Eastern Anglophile Liberal Establishment for decades.

Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis had both been present, possibly together, in Dallas on the day of the shooting, although the truth of these allegations has never been finally established. Both Hunt and Sturgis were of course Bay of Pig vdterans who would later appear center stage in Wa- tergate. There were also allegations that Hunt and Sturgis were among a group of six to eight derelicts who were found in boxcars sitting on the railroad tracks behind the grassy knoll near Dealey Plaza, and who were rounded up and taken in for questioning by the Dallas police on the day of the assassination. Some suspected that Hunt and Sturgis had participated in the assassination. Some of these allegations were at the center of the celebrated 1085 defamation case ofHunt v.

But during that same period oftime, Bush may have shared some common acquaintances with Lee Harvey Oswald.

But in March_l977, just before de Mohrenschildt was scheduled to be inter- viewed by Caeton Fonzi of the House commit- tee's staff, he was found dead in Palm Beach, Florida. His death was quickly ruled a suicide. One of the last people to see him alive was Ed- ward Jay Epstein, who was also interviewing De Mohrenschildt about the Kennedy assassi- nation for an upcoming book Epstein is one of the writers on the Kennedy assassination who enjoyed excellent relations with the late James Angleton of the CIA. If de Mohrenschildt were alive today, he might be able to enlighten us about his relations with George Bush, and per- haps afford us some insight into Bush's activi- ties during this epoch. Jeanne De Mohrenschildt rejected .the End- ing of suicide in her husband's death. \"He was eliminated before he got to that committee,\" the widow told a journalist in 1978, \"because someone did not want him to get to it\" She also maintained that George de Mohrenschildt had been surreptitiously injected with mind-alter- ing drugs.'' After De Mohrenschildt's death, his personal address book was located, and it contained this entry: \"Bush, George H.W. (Poppy) 1412 W.

Paley of CBS, plus many oil men. stockbrokers, and the like.' George De Mohrenschildt recounted a num- ber of different versions of his life, so it is very difficult to establish the facts about him. Ac- cording to one version, he was the Russian Count Sergei De Mohrenschildt, but when he arrived in the United States in 1938 he carried a Polish passport identifying him as Jeny Ser- gius von Mohrenschildt, born in Mozyr. Russia in 1911. He may in fact have been a Polish offi- cer, or a correspondent for the Polish News Service, or none of these. He worked for a time for the Polish Embassy in Washington, D.C. Some say that de Mohrenschildt met the chair- man of Humble Oil, Blaffer, and that Blaffer procured him a job. Other sources say that dur- ing this time De Mohrenschildt was affiliated with the War Department According to some accounts, he later went to work for the French Deuxikme Bureau, which wanted to know about petroleum exports from the United States to Europe. De Mohrenschildt in 1941 became associated with a certain Baron Konstantin von Maydell ,.in a public affairs venture called \"Facts and F,ilm.\" Maydell was considered a Nazi agent by \" the'FBI; and.in Septernbtr'l942he was sent to North Dakota for an internment that would last four years. De Mohenschildt was also reported- ly in contact with Japanese networks at this time. In June 1941, De Mohrenschildt was ques- tioned by police at Port Arthur, Texas, on the suspicion of espionage atter he was found mak- ing sketches of port facilities. During 1941. De Mohrenschildt applied for a post in the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS). According to the official account, he was not hired. Soon after he made the application. he went to Mexico where he cayed until 1944. In the latter year, he began stuc; for a master's degree in petroleum engineering at the University of Texas. Ac- cording to some accounts, during this period De Mohrenschildt was investigated by the Office of Naval Intelligence because of alleged commu- nist sympathies. After the war, De Mohrenschildt worked as - a petroleum engineer in Cuba and Venezuela, and in Caracas he had several meetings with the Soviet ambassador. During the postwar years, he also worked in the Rangely oil field in Colorado. During the 1950s. after having mar- ried Winifred Sharpless, the daughter of an oil millionaire, de Mohrenschildt was active as an independent oil entrepreneur. In 1957, De Mohrenschildt was approved by the CIA Office of Security to be hired as a U.S. government geologist for a mission to Yugosla- via. Upon his return he was interviewed by one J. Walter Moore of the CIA'S Domestic Contact Service, with whom he remained in contact During 1958, de Mohrenschildt visited Ghana, Togo, and Dahomey (now Benin); during 1959, he visited Africa again and returned by way of Poland. In 1959, he married Jeanne, his fourth wife, a fonner ballet dancer and dress designer who had been born in Manchuria, where her father had been one of the directors of the Chi- nese Eastern Railroad. During the summer of 1960,' George and Jeanne De Mohrenschildt told their friends that they were going to embark on a walking tour of 11,000 miles along Indian trails from Mexico to Central America. One of their princi- pal destinations was Guatemala City, where they were staying at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961, after which they made. their way home by way of Panama and Haiti. After two months in Haiti, the De Moh- renschildts returned to Dallas, where they came into contact with Lee Harvey Oswald, who had come back to the United States from his sojourn in the Soviet Union in June 1962 By this time, de Mohrenschildt was also in frequent contact with Admiral Henry C. Bruton and his wife, to whom he introduced the Oswalds. Ad- miral Bruton was the former director of naval communications. It is established that between October 1962 and late April 1963, de Mohrenschildt was a very important figure in the life of Oswald and his Russian wife. Despite.Oswald's lack of so- cial graces, De Mohrenschildt introduced him into Dallas society, took him to parties, assisted him in finding employment and much more. It was through De Mohrenschildt that Oswald met a certain Volkmar Schmidt, a young German geologist who had studied with Professor Wil- helm Kuetemeyer, an expert in psychosomatic medicine and religious philosophy at the Uni- versity of Heidelberg, who compiled a detailed psychological profile of Oswald. Jeanne and George helped Marina move her belongings during one of her many estrangements from 0s- wald. According to some accounts, De Moh- renschildt's influence on Oswald was so great during this period that he could virtually dic- tate important decisions to the young ex-Ma- rine simply by making suggestions. According to some versions, de Moh- renschildt was aware of Oswald's alleged April 10,1963 attempt to assassinate the well-known right-wing General Edwin Walker. According to Marina, De Mohrenschildt once asked Oswald, \"Lee, how did you miss General Walker?\" On April 19, George and Jeanne De Mohrenschildt went to New York City, and on April 29, the CIA Office ofsecurity found that it had no objection to De Mohrenschildt's acceptance of a contract with the Duvalier regime of Haiti in the field of natural resource development De Moh- renschildt appears to have departed for Haiti on May 1,1963. In the meantime, Oswald had left Dallas and traveled to New Orleans. According to Mark Lane, \"there is evidence that De Mohrenschildt:$erved as a CIA control officer who directed 0Sjkaldns actions.\" Much of the extensive published literatureod de Moh- renschildt converges oh the idea that he was a control agent for Oswald on behalf of some intelligence agency.\" It is therefore highlyinteresting that George Bush's name turns up in the personal address book of George de Mohrenschildt"},{"pageNumber":755,"pageContent":"The Warren Commission went to absurd lengths to cover up the fact that George De Moh- renschildt was a denizen of the world of the intelligence agencies.

The Warren Commission concluded: \"The Commission's investigation has devel- oped no signs of subversive or disloyal conduct on the part of either of the de Mohrenschildts.

Par- rott had been discharged from the U.S. Air Force for psychiatric reasons in 1959. Parrott had an alibi for the time ofthe Dallas shootings; he had been in the company of another Repub- lican activist. According to press accounts, Par- rott was a member of the right-wing faction of the Houston COP. which was oriented toward the John Birch Society and which opposed Bush's chairmanship.\" According to the San Fmncisco Eraminer, Bush's press office in Au- gust 1988 first said that Bush had not made any such call, and challenged the authenticity of . the FBI documents. Several days later Bush's spokesman said that the candidate \"does not recall\" placing . the . call. One day atter he reported Parrott to the FBI, Bush received a highly sensitive, high-level briefing from the Bureau: \"Date: November 29,1963 \"To: Director of Intelligence and Research Department of State \"From: John Edgar Hoover, Director \"Subject: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY, NOVEMBER 22,1963 \"Our Miami. Florida Office on November 23, 1963 advised that the Office of Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in Miami advised that the De- partment of State feels some misguided anti- Castro group might capitalize on the present situation and undertake an unauthorized raid against Cuba, believing that the assassination of President John F. Kennedy might herald a change in U.S. policy, which is not true. \"Our sources and informants familiar with Cuban matters in the Miami area advise that the general feeling in the anti-Castm Cuban community is one of stunned disbelief and, even among those who did not entirely agree with the President's policy concerning Cuba, the feeling is that the President's death repre- sents a great loss not only to the U.S. but to all Latin America. These sources lmow of no plans for unauthorized action against Cuba. \"An informant who has furnished reliable in- formation in the past and who is close to a small pro-Cash group in Miami has advised that those individuals are afraid that the assassina- tion of the President may result in strong re- pressive measures being taken against them and. although pro-Castro in their feelings, re- gret the assassination. \"The substance of the foregoing information was orally furnished to Mr. George Bush of the Central Intelligence Agency and Captain Wil- liam Edwards of the Defense Intelligence Agency on November 23,1963, by Mr. W.T. For- syth of this Bureau.\" William T. Forsyth, since deceased, was an official of the FBI's Washington headquarters; during the time he was attached to the bureau's subversive control section, he ran the investiga- tion of Dr. Martin Luther King. Was he also a part of the FBI's harassment of Dr. King? The efforts of journalists to locate Captain Edwards have not been successful. This FBI document identifying George Bush as a CIA agent in November 1963 was first pub lished by Joseph McBride in The Nation in July 1988, just before Bush received the Republican nomination for President. McBride's source ob- served: \"I know [Bush] was involved in the Ca- ribbean. I know he was involved in the suppres- sion of things after the Kennedy assassination. There was a very definite worry that some Cu- ban groups were going to move against Castro and attempt to blame it on the CIA.\"'* When pressed for confirmation or denial. Bush's spokesman Stephen Hart commented: \"Must be another George Bush.\" Within a short time, the CIA itself would ped- dle the same damage control line. On July 19, 1988, in the wake of wide public attention td the report published in The Nation, CIA spokes- woman Sharron Basso departed from the nor- mal CIA policy of refusing to confirm or deny reports that any person is or was a CIA employ- ee. CIA spokeswoman Basso told the Associat- ed Press that the CIA believed that \"the record"},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"should be clarified.\" She said that the FBI docu- ment \"apparently\" referred to a George Wil- liam Bush who had worked in 1963 on the night shift at CIA headquarters, and that \"would have been the appropriate place to have received such an FBI report\" According to her account, the George William Bush in question had lett the CIA to join the Defense Intelligence Agency in 1964. For the CIA to volunteer the name of one of its former employees to the press was a shocking violation of traditional methods, which are sup posedly designed to keep such names a closely guarded secret This revelation may have con- stituted a violation of federal law. But no exer- tions were too great when it came to damage control for George Bush. George William Bush had indeed worked for the CIA, the DIA, and the Alexandria, Virginia Department of Public Welfare before joining the Social Security Administration. in whose Arlington, Virginia office he was employed as a claims representative in 1988. George William Bush told The Nation that while at the CIA he was \"just a lowly researcher and analystn who worked with documents and photos and never received interagency briefings. He had never met Forsyth of the FBI or Captain Edwards of the DM. \"So it wasn't me,\" said George William Bush.% Later, George William Bush formalized his denial in a sworn statement to a federal court in Washington, D.C. The affidavit acknowledges that while working at CIA headquarters be- tween September 1963 and February 1964, Ceorge William Bush was the junior person on a three- to four-man watch which was on duty when Kennedy was shot. But,as George William Bush goes on to say, \"have carefully reviewed the FBI memorandum to the Director, Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Department of State dated November 29,1963 which mentions a Mr. George Bush of the Central Intelligence Agency. . . . I do not recognize the contents of the memorandum as information furnished to me orally or otherwise during the time I was at the CIA In fact, during my time at the CIA, I did not receive any oral communications from any government agency of any nature whatsoever. I did not receive any information relating to the Kennedy assassination during my time at the CIA from the FBI. \"Based on the above, it is my conclusion that I am not the Mr. George Bush of the Central Intelligence Agency referred to in the memo- rand~m.\"~' So we are left with the strong suspicion that the \"Mr. George Bush of the CIA\" referred to by the FBI is our own George Herbert Walker Bush, who, in addition to his possible contact with Lee Harvey Oswald's controller, may thus also join the ranks of the Kennedy assassina- tion coverup. It makes perfect sense for George Bush to be called in on a matter involving the Cuban community in Miami, since that is a place where Ceorge has traditionally had a con- stituency. George inherited it from his father, Prescott Bush of Jupiter Island, and later passed it on to his own son, Jeb. '?t k highly interesting that George Bush's name turns up in the personal address book of George De Mohrenschildt,\" who some experts believe was Lee Harvey 0swald9s CIA control officer.

(6) Thou shalt establish laws and courts of law to administer these laws, including the death penalty for those who kill, administered inly if there is one testifying witness. (7) Thou shalt not be cruel to animals. From a sociological perspective and from a perspective steeped in a religious reality-tunnel, these \"laws\" may sound honorable, but these laws are considered by rabbinic tradition as the minimal moral duties enjoined by the Bible on all men, except Jews. Even though the Bible is mentioned, the Judaica cites the Talmud, not the Christian Bible, as the source. So, the Noahide laws apply only to non-Jews living under Jewish jurisdiction. Interestingly, Websters dictionary, New International Edition 2nd Ed 1950, states that a Noachite is \"one who has taken the 21st degree of the Scottish rite (Freemasonry)\". The doctrine of Freemasonry, applied in a sociological format, consists of a \"disbelief in the Divinity of Christ, and a determination to replace that doctrine by Naturalism or Rationalism.\" Like anything else, it is all open to interpretation. To the Jew, idol worship might be any Christian who displays a crucifix or cross (these are forbidden items in Israel today). Sentence under the Noahide law: decapitation. Since the second \"law\" prohibits blaspheme and Jews do not believe as Christians do (that Jesus Christ was God), Christians adhering to this Biblical \"fact\" will be tried for blaspheme. Sentence: de-capitation."},{"pageNumber":769,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 In fact, the sentence for breaking any of the Noahide Laws is decapitation. In discussing this curious sociological development, I was reminded of the stories that have been going around for the past three or four years about shipments of guillotines into the United States. A connection? Despite the fact that \"constitutional principles\" prohibit the making of a law that respects an establishment of religion, it would appear that the government is determined to do so anyway. Even the eamarking of money for the support of Israel, a self- proclaimed Theocratic state, is considered by some to be illegal under the \"constitution.\" Dr. Ernest Easterly 111, Professor of International Law and Director of the Institute for Comparative Legal Studies, Southern University Law Center, says, \" With further recognition by other nations and international courts, the Seven Noahide Laws should become the cornerstone of a truly 'civilized' international legal order. \" Personally, I am neutral relative to all this, because I know who I am and don't need to project part of my psyche \"out there\" in a religious sense, but for the majority of human beings on the planet who, in cultural religious terms, are not Jewish, this develop- ment could be the basis for a 'death sentence'.

The Fcdenl Rcscrvc is no more f&ml than Fred Smith's Fecknl Ex- press. The bankers arc in busilless to make money. That's why we have $300 billion in iatcrcst right now. That is why John Fitzgcrald Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln wcrc assassinated. because both of them bypassed the bnakcrs. Abe Lincoln in 1863 authorizcci $450 million in grccnhacks and JFK in 1963 authorized $450 billion in Unilcd Slates notes. Well, ll~ese intemalional bankers ?hcond thing-we would stop the incomc tax bc- cause income tax is unconslilulimal. All we have to do is go to the state houses of the 48 stares and determine wbether or not they properly ratified the Sixteentl~ Amendmenl. They did not. Them! is no statute of limira- lion on bud.

It is no wonder that our divorce rate is so high, that suicide is on the increase, that social deviations from the norm are more and more acceptable. As a nation, we appear to have lost our way, or rather, the huge number of choices with which we are daily confronted, has caused us to become confused and unable to make those choices. We live in a throw-away society, programmed not to last, this is part of the Age of Aquarius Conspiracy. Since Stanford Research Institute first mounted its offensive, back in the late 1950's,- early 1960's, we have been subjected to subtle but heavy pressures by Stanford's team of specialists in the field of future shocks. We have, since the 1950's been through a prolonged \"softening up\" to condition us so that we will change our ways and our life-styles at every level. This insidious pressure was increased in intensity in 1986, and will reach its highest intensity levels by 1993. Things are changing so fast, that we have become \"punch drunk,\" a scientific fact, as we shall see. The latest threat to our freedom is the personal computer card, which we will be discussing. The computer card will accelerate the process of depriving us of our familiar environment, and environment as we shall see means more than just the usual explanation of the word. We are going through a period of trauma, on a scale that we cannot begin to imagine, let alone believe. This is as it should be; this is how Tavistock Institute and Stanford planned it, this is how the social scientists have mapped it out. Nothing changes by itself, all changes are preplanned, and as a result of this onslaught, we have been changed, very gradually at first, and then with increasing momentum from one nation into a polyglot of nations. We are no longer the one nation as we claim to be. Nor have we ever been, except in the beginning, when our forbears came from Anglo-Saxon stock and gave us a common nation with a common religion, namely Christianity. Our forbears spoke a common language, held common ideals, and shared the common religion of Christianity. There were no aliens in their midst, that only came much later, and was deliberately planned to break us up into several fragmented nationalities, segments of differing cultures and languages, which could under no circumstances be called one nation. The United States is many nations striving to co-exist under a common system of government. The 'culture shock which resulted when these aliens were allowed into the midst of a common language-common religious and cultural background, caused great confusion, and made \"one nation\", an unworkable concept. It was part of an ongoing Freemason conspiracy to nullify the American Revolution. The social upheavels which follow~d, can all be traced back to this starting point. Science has proved that there is a limit to absorption of change, before people crack up completely. The U.S. has reached the limit of its absorption capabilities. Individually this truth applies, and we shall examine a few of the profound implications of this as we proceed. Nations are made up of individuals, and individuals, no matter how robust and equipped with great stamina they are, have a definite limit to their ability to absorb and withstand changes without fragmenting. That was the basis of the StrategicBombing Survey which called for the saturation bombing of German worker housing, during WWII. The study was conducted by the Prudential Insurance Company, and its subsequent adoption and application proved very successful in bringing about the defeat of Germany. Many of the scientists who were engaged in that project, are either still working onsaturation bombing America, or they have passed their knowledge onto others who are * Please read note at bottom of page 6371, 06 37.0"},{"pageNumber":798,"pageContent":"continuing with their devilish work. The enemy decided to make a strong movelagainst the people of the U.S. back in 1980. Who is the enemy? Are we talking about the Russians? While the criminals in the Kremlin are the enemies of free people everywhere, they are not the subject of this report. We are talking about the corporations and people in what is known as the Eastern Liberal Establishment, allied with their European cousins, backed by the biggest and most important banks, financial institutions and insurance companies; communications networks, the printed media, law, education and religion. .This group was responsible for providing the assistance which brought about the Bolshevik Revolution and WWI, as well as WWII. This is the group that managed the controlled disintegra- tion of the U.S. economy, created \"local wars\", and international tensions, mass brainwashing of the nation through 'The Beatles\", drug cults, mystic cults subjectingus to one cultural shock after another until we have become nearly totally confused, dazed, numbed and largely an apathetic people. Why has this been done to us? Simply put, it was and is being done to break down our resistance and weaken our determination to resist changes we know are against the best interests of the nation and individuals who go to make it up. America today can be compared with the soldier who falls asleep in the thick of battle. We fall asleep when we give way to apathy, brought on when confronted by confusion through changes that so alter our environment, that we are no longer able to make the right choices. We react as the soldier often times does in the heat af battle; we give up because we don't know what else to do. There is a technical term for this condition and it is called \"long range penetration strain\". The art of subjecting a very large group of people to continued long-range penetration strain, was developed by scientists working out of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, the Stanford Research.Institute, the Rand Corporation, and at least 150 similar but smaller institutions. Dr. Kurt Lewin, the scientist who developed this fiendish art, and I use that word as a quotation, has caused the average patriotic American to fret over various conspiracy theories, and his failure to isolate and understand the underlying causes of changes and decaying values, which he sees all around him, and who fears the social, moral and political changes he deems undesirable and does not want. Now we won't find Dr. Lewin in any of the regular history books which are in fact nothing but a view of war from the side of the victor. In fact I take great pride, and justly so, as the first to bring the name of Dr. LRwin to your attention. It was Dr. Lewin who organized the Harvard Psychological Clinic, and the Institute for Social Research. These names do not give any indication as to what their purpose is. They remind me of the infamous bill to reform coinage and mint laws, which was passed in 1873. It was certainly a harmless-sounding bill. but the title was misleading; indeed deliberately so. Senator John Sherman betrayed the nation into the hands of the international bankers. Sherman sponsored this \"harmless\" bill without reading it, (and I wonder if President Reagan signed the INF Treaty without reading it), one of the most ugly frauds ever perpetrated on the American people. Aswe know, its true purpose was to demonetize silver, and give the thieving banks unlimited powers over this nation; powers to which the bankers were not entitled in terms clearly and unmistakably laid out in our Constitution.

Lewin's colleagues in his satanic plot to diminish our national will to resist changes not in our interets, were John Rawlings Reese, Richard Crossman, Eric Trist, H.V. Dicks, Wallace Harmon, Charles Anderson, Gardner Lindzey, Richard Price, and W.R. Bion. This is not a complete list of the plotters. There were and are hundreds of others involved in forcing radical uncontrolled changes upon us, but these were the ringleaders. Together they founded Stanford, Rand, MIT, and the National Training Laboratories, Essalen Institute, and scores of similar institutions. What was taught at these institutions spread out across this great land like a cloud of poison gas, the foul miasma penetrating government at all levels, the church, schools, the news media, opinion makers, Congress, the Supreme Court, until every layer of our lives, national and private became saturated with deadly toxic poison to which we have now almost totally succumbed. In 1980, I exposed the Aquarian-New Age conspiracy, which was the result of four years of intensive investigation and research, with which I am still continuing. The success of the Age of Aquarius-New Age conspiracy, can be seen in the visible signs of breakdown in our environment, the all-inclusive state in which we live. The use of \"rock music\" to spread the message-of drug-cults, the overwhelming rise in mindless violence, especially among teenagers and so-called \"serial killers\", and the overlapping and unmistakable signs of lethargy which is called \"long range penetration7' are part of our environment and as dangerous, if not more so than pollutants in the air we breathe. We as a nation, and individuals, were not prepared for the changes that were forced upon us by the Aquarian Conspiracy, therefore our response to this danger has been a falling-off of our ability to withstand and resist it. As a nation we have become fatigued, we are in psychological distress, of which widespread apathy is the outward manifestation The Tavistock Institute describes our national condition after two decades of saturation bombing shocks, social turbulance caused by created crises, and crisis management as follows: 'There are three distinct phases in the response and reaction to social crises displayed by large population groups. First, there is superficiality, the population under attack, will defend itself by adopting slogans, this does not identify the source of the crisis, and therefore does nothing to address it, hence the crisis willpersist. The second is fragmentation. This occurs as the crisis continues, and social order breaks down.\" And who can deny that with the huge increase in the use of drugs, with crack making thousands of new instant addicts each day, ashockingrise in the number of murdered infants, which now far exceeds our casualties in two World Wars, the acceptance of homosexuality and lesbianism, with laws to protect the \"right\" to ply their destructive way of life; murder, rape, a falling off in education, a numbing increase in divorce, that our society is breaking down. Tavistock says: \"Smaller groups will break away to defend themselves; the so-called \"maladaption\" because here again, the source of the crisis is not identified, and so the response is maladaption.\" \"Then, there is the third phase, where the population group goes into 'self realization', and turns away from the induced crisis, and there follows a maladaptive response, accompanied with active synoptic idealism and disassociation\". According to Stanford, and I know this to be the truth, this type of induced trauma has been going on in America for 30 years, yet how many of us are aware of the insidious brainwashing to which we have been forcibly exposed. An example of this can be found in the mysterious gang wars which broke out on the West Side of New York in the 1950's. Where this came from was not known until very recently, when"},{"pageNumber":800,"pageContent":"researchers (including myself), uncovered the connection between the seemingly chance encoun- ters and the hidden forces that directed them. Gang wars were carefully planned events deliberately created to shock society and cause ripples of disturbances. By 1958 there were in excess of200 of these gangs, but then a very strange thing happened. In 1966 they had all-but vanished from the streets of Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Newark and Chicago. Throughout the period of gang warfare, the public reacted exactly according to profile; society as a whole could not comprehend gang warfare of this nature, and the public responded in a maladaptive manner. But had there been some who were wise enough to realize that what they were witnessing was a social engineering brainwashing experiment, the whole filthy edifice would have collapsed. Even if such a discovery had been made, there would have been no media coverage; the discovery would certainly have.been smothered. An example of a large group being unwittingly subjected to brainwashing is that of the Beatles, who brought Tavistock's Theo Adomo's 12-atonal system of music to the US. Without the cooperation of the electronic media, and in particular that of the scurrilous Ed Sullivan, who knew very well what the plot was, nobody would have given this motley crew and \"their\" music the time of day. Now that we know it, it is too late to counteract its insidious influence, the damage has been done. Our values have been changed forever by the rag-tag band from fiverpool, or rather from the Tavistock Institute. And they didn't write the music, if one dare call it that; Theo Adorno did it for them The prime function of the Beatles was to be discovered by \"teenagers\", and incidently the word 'teenagers' was never used until after the close of WWII. It was a trigger-word created by the Tavistock Institute to create a distinctive segment of the population and persuade them to believe that the Beatles really was their \"favorite\" group. The word teenager was constructed by Tavistock, and released for mass youth control purposes. The Beatles did a perfect job, \"with a little help from their friends\", i.e. illegal substances we call drugs. The~eatles were a highly visible \"new types', and please take note of that expression, because it is part of the jargon used by these social tinkerers, and as such, the Beatles made new styles and new tastes for teenagers which upset the older generation. It is important to note the diliberate fragmentation -inducing language. The role of the media was, and remains, very important in the brainwashing of society. The street gangwars ended, because the press and TV media ceased to pay further attention to a medium of change that was \"burned out\". They had served their purpose, which was to create turbulence in society. And thus that attention was focused on the so-called \"beat generation\", yet another phrase coined by Tavistock in its effort to bring about social changes in America. The hippies and beatniks, the drop-outs in jeans, sandals, filthy clothes and long hair became the role models of youth, just as the \"cleaner\" Beatles had been before that. This created style took in millions of young people, and even the older generation began to believe that American youth was uncrrgoing a revolution, failing all the while to realize that it was not a spontaneous movement but an artificially created one. These were the disciples of lysergic acid, LSD, so conveniently provided for them by the highly respected Swiss pharmaceutical Sandoz company, and financed by the great Warburg banking dynasty, and brought to the U.S. by Aldous Hwley. The new \"wonder drug\" was promptly"},{"pageNumber":801,"pageContent":"distributed on campuses in free sample package lots. There is a question that cries out to be answered: \"What was the FBI doing at that time? Was it fast asleep, or deliberately looking the other way?\" With the coming of \"rock\", which I will henceforth use as shorthand to describe Adorno's devilish bedlam of sounds, a tremendous increase in the use of marijuana occured. How did it occur? Well, it just didn't \"occur\", it was all carefully planned well in advance, and the jackals of the media saw to it that the \"new culture\", (another of Tavistock's creations), received the widest possible publicity, which cost the puppet-masters, not a thin dime. Now because of the anger I feel about people, and I think particularly about one individual, I make no apology for language which perhaps is not of the standard I am accustomed to, but one of the most disgusting slobs ever to walk the cities of America, was an alien, Alan Ginsberg. We can be sure that Ginsberg's antecedents were not Anglo Saxons, nor did any of them come over with the Pilgrim Fathers; rather, they came over on the crests of the Roosevelt flood- tides of Eastern Europe waves of immigrants, and their coming is one of the worst disasters ever to befall America, and contributed largely to preventing America from becoming a unified nation. This Ginsburg pushed LSD through advertising, which cost him nothing, though it would have fetched billions of dollars in advertising revenues for TV and the newspapers under normal circumstances. This free advertising reached a crescendo in the 1960'~~ thanks to the ever-willing cooperation of the jackals of the media, The effect of Ginsburg's massive advertising campaign on the American public was devastating; suddenly we were confronted with one cultural shock after another, in rapid succession. Here it is necessary to point out that through the introduction of alien races into our society, the task was a great deal less arduous than it would otherwise have been. We became \"over-exposed and over-stimulated\", and again we must remind ourselves that this jargon is taken from Tavistock and Stanford manuals. We were \"overstimulated\" and overwhelmed by this new development, and when that happened, our minds began to lapse into apathy; it was just too much for us to cope with, i.e., long range penetration had taken hold. Ginsburg claimed to be a poet, but no greater garbage has been written by anyone aspiring to be a poet. Ginsburg's real function was to push the new subculture and force its acceptance upon the U.S. To assist him in this endeavor, Ginsburg coopted the services of Norman Mailer, and it was Mailer who got Ginsburg on national television, under the fake pretext of having a serious discussion with him, which of course was no more than a horrible charade. We ought to take note of the method in which these demons get free advertsing on TV. The electronic media moguls always have big hearts when it comes to giving free time to dirty products and even filthier ideas. Their promotion of Hollywood garbage speaks volumes. - Ginsburg gave anationally televised performance in which he recommended the use of LSD and marijuana. Not to be outdone by the electronics media, every one of Ginsburg's dope friends in the newspaper business wrote special reports and articles about \"this colorful character\". Ginsburg's friend, Kenny Love, published a five-page report. When newspapers want to advertise something not yet acceptable to the general public, they write \"articles\" in the papers or have \"discussions\" with a learned panel on TV. Love's article appeared in the New YorkTimes, and let me stress that had Ginsburg taken out the same amount of space in a paid ad, it would have cost him at least S50,000, but he didn't have to worry, thanks to his friend Love, Ginsburg got it all for free. Worse yet, (or better yet, depending upon one's viewpoint), the article was picked up by United Press (UP) and telexed to HUNDREDS of newspapers and magazines around the country,"},{"pageNumber":802,"pageContent":"under the guise of a \"news\" story. Harpers Bazaar and Time magazine, duly made Mr. Ginsburg \"respectable\". If a campaign of this magnitude were presented to Mr. Ginsburg by an advertsing agency, it would have come with a price tag of close to $1 million dollars! No wonder I call the news media a pack of jackals. I suggest that you try something I once tried, with an expose on the Federal Reserve Board swindle. I took my story to major newspapers and magazines, TV and radio stations. Some made promises that sounded good, but not asingle word of that article ever appeared in the establishment print and electronic media. I suggest that you take this account of how LSD was promoted in America to the news media, and offer it to them at no charge, and see if you have any better luck with it than I did with mine. The point is that without massive media hype, and with almost round-the-clock coverage, the hippy-beatnik, rock drug cult would never have got off the ground; it would have remained a small localized affair. The Beatles with their silly twanging guitars, and ridiculous expressions, would never have amounted to a hill of beans. Societywould not have been subjected to one series of jolts after another. The men buried inside the think-tanks, whose names and faces are still not known to but a few of us, made sure that the press provided the necessary coverage. They also made sure that their plot to turn our young people into something which has no place in a Christian republic, was not uncovered. Thus was our society \"driven mad\", through psychological shocks and stressful events, the actual language used in Tavistock training manuals. By 1966, the mother of this evil, the Tavistock Institute was ready to launch another of its mishapen creatures on an unsuspecting world. The Science Policy Research Unit, (SPRU), was opened in Sussex University. Privately billed as a \"future shock research\" center, a title given to so-called future oriented psychology designed to manipulate whole population groups and induce \"future shocks\", it was the first of several such intsitutions. \"Future shocks\" is described as events or series of events that come so fast that the human brain cannot absorb the information. As I said earlier, science has shown that there are clear limits to the amount and nature of change which the human mind can absorb and deal with. After that, apathy sets in as the targeted group discovers that it does not want to make choices. Apathy is preceded by senseless violence, of which the New York and Los Angeles street gangs were part, hostility, murder appear. Apathy about these conditions then sets in, followed by withdrawal. Long range penetration strain now takes over. Such a group is easily controlled, and will docilely take orders without rebelling, which is of course, the object of the exercise. \"Future shocks\", said SPRU \"is defined as physical and psychological distress arising from the excess load on the decision-making mechanism of human- ity\". That again is the jargon which I have lifted directly from Tavistock manuals, which it doesn't know I have in my possession. It will probably shock them that their inner sanctum has been penetrated! Just as an overloaded electrical circuit will activate a trip-switch, so humans \"trip out\", which is a syndrome that medical science is only now beginning to understand, although the brainwashers of Tavistock knew it as far back as the 1920's. In 1962 the SPRU was run by Leland Bradford, Kenneth Dam, Ronald Lippert, and of course, a host of other scientists. Until I first revealed them, these name were NOT known among rightwing circles in America. Even today, they are known only to a relatively small group of researchers. SPRU \"future shocks\" research unit run by the three scientists just mentioned, became a"},{"pageNumber":803,"pageContent":"training ground for scores of agents who later became skilled in manipulative techniques which were used to plant its policy papers in goverriment departments at all levels. That is why the U.S. will be run in the near future by committees and councils, who have been brainwashed into taking policy-planning decisons which they believe to be their own; decisions that will change the form of government and the quality of life in the U.S. tosuch a degree, we shall no longer be the country and the people we are now. We will have become a changed society through \"crises adaption\". Our environment will have been changed. There is much talk about the environment, and environment to most people does not appear in their thinking as changes in life styles; changes they appear to have little if any ability to control. Environment of change produces deep anxiety and confusion, and we begin to look to group decison-making, rather than making use of our own resources. This strategy is a deliberate one, aimed at the most vulnerable of all areas, our self-image, and leads inevitably to our being led like lambs to the slaughter. When we are manipulated by unscrupulous men without being aware of it, the stage is already set for a relatively easy transition from the present Constitution and our form of government, to a transitional period of change, leading to the entry into a One World Government, which will take a big step forward during the tenure of George Bush in the White House. While there are those who say, \"it cannot happen in America,\" and how often haven't we heard that expression, the fact is IT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED. Our will to resist events not to our liking has been steadily undermined since 1950. We will resist, some of us say. Well, some of us may be able to do that, but we will be in the minority. Computerization has already robbed us of the ability to prevent being brainwashed and controlled. Which brings me to another environment, PEOPLE CONTROL, also known as personal information control, without whichgovernments cannot play their numbers game. We the people have absolutely no means of knowing just what government knows or does not know about us. Their computer files are not subject to scrutiny by we the people. Do we really believe that personal information is sacrosant? Remember, in every society, there are rich and powerful families who control law enforcement agencies, and this includes the USA, and I can tell you that in my more than twenty years of research, I have definitely proved the existence of such families. Do not for one minute think that if one of these families wanted to find out about us, they could not do so. There is no guarantee that a man like Kissinger, doesn't have his own private dossier on hundreds of individuals on his enemy list. Some may think this far fetched. The secret Freemasonic P2 and Comite Monte Carlo had such enemy lists, running into many thousands of names. Kissinger was, and might well still be, a member of Comite Monte Carlo. In any event, we would never know (until it is too late), what information government (and so many private agencies), have onus. Mass surveillance is here. It is not something that may come in the future. The Bilderbergerswho have gained in strength during the last twoyears, are known to have their own \"pattern recognition technique\". This is the jargon used by Tavistock Institute. The Bilderberger's security has computers capable of conducting mass-surveillance of any given population group, which includes the most personal details. The Bilderbergers tap into data-gathering terminals used by commercial credit informa- tion companies.They have a plan calling for international identity cards linked to fingerprints-This chilling information was provided by my top intelligence contact in this field.

A bill which will soon become law, is designed to regulate the amount of cash that each person will be permitted to have at any given time. Pilot automated electronic payments are already being tested in Western Europe. Our right to privacy is about to be eliminated. Machine-readable documents, bearing internationally recognizable numbers are already here, which will soon embody our drivers licence number, which numbers can identify us anywhere. In the world of George Orwell, we learned how absolute dictatorship operates in the daily lives of people, and by the year 2000, there is little doubt that we shall be in the dictatorial grip of a One World Government. How can we be controlled? It will be something of the following order: All transactions we do will have to be authorized by the central data bank, and this will not happen, unless an authorizing number is displayed at the point where the transaction is taking place. Let us suppose that we want to purchase food at asupermarket. Cash will not be acceptable, so we will show some type of \"credit card\" (shorthand for whatever the card will be called). However, to prevent illegal duplication, our card will have a secret encoded number which we cannot see and won't be aware of. It might well be the number 666,so popular with Bible students who prophecy the future. Whatever the number, it will be tied inwith fingerprint and voiceprint. If the secret number on your card does not check out, it will come up and your purchase will not be accepted. If you have been \"marked\" by the government, that too will appear and your transaction will be cancelled. It will of course not be possible to tamper with such cards, especially with the encoded voice and fingerprint data, which means that if we are \"outlaws\" in the very real sense of the word, we will have great difficulty in obtaining food, as our card or absence of a card will preclude us from the system. We have got to avoid the numbersgame, our future depends onus being able to short-circuit the \"system\", and this is the kind of subject our Christianuniversitiesshould be teaching. We should not think this speculation or imagination. Already there exists a far reaching system of tracing individuals, through the records of telephone companies for example. Telephone calls in the future will automatically deliver the address of ALL numbers called, even if not listed in the directory. It has become so sophisticated that there exists electronic means of identifying and linking individuals with records held by credit card companies, insurance companies and employers and banks.This system can be fine-tuned and up-graded, which will leave us as naked as new-born babes in the hands of the One World Government If you are tempted to think that GLOBAL agencies don't exist, then go down town in Washington, DC, and find the office of the so-called \"police force of the world\", Interpol. Interpol is a One World Government Agency operating illegally in the heart of our nation. Computers that can perform complex operations in seconds, and surveillance techniques have improved dramatically in the last decade, make it fairly simple to trace anyone back to the source from where the telephone call was made. Computerized payments will be compulsory in the near future, and will provide ready-made data on individuals, by linking billing information for utilities, TV, automobile payments etc. By this means, an almost complete picture of the individual can be arrived at. In the near future we are destined to become a cashless society, with profoundly far- reaching impact on our rights as individuals, economic freedom and our whole way of life. Our right to privacy will disappear, even though it may still be in the Constitution. Great pains will be taken to conceal the real intent of future legislation which will deprive us of our rights."},{"pageNumber":805,"pageContent":"We will be told that new laws are necessary to govern electronic payments, having-been subjected to a barrage of propaganda on how convenient such payments are over cash transactions.

Cashlimits the abuseof automation and its capture ofpersonal data, which clearly threatens the individual. The flow of cash is difficult to follow when one knows how to follow certain basic elementary rules, which government clearly hates. It was one of the reasons why China cracked down on its \"dissidents\", because free market and floating labor paid in cash, made people control very much more difficult than before. The globalists have already taken control of data gathering companies including market survey companies which give information vital to control systems. Companies of this type have proliferated in the past decade, and their size, and influence, ought to be of the utmost concern to those who believe in individual rights and freedom By channeling such data to a central computer (ordered by law as a means of tracing \"drug dealers\" for example), a serious threat to our liberty is immediately apparent, and will bring with it a change in the way we live. We shall be hearing a great deal about this in terms of \"long range penetration\" and \"future shocks environment\", to use-Tavistock terminology. The Tavistock Institute, the mother of all brainwashing institutes, is funded by Rockefeller and a number of giant global companies such as Unilever. The Survey Research Center, was established by Tavistock and became the top-dog in social profiling in the US. This institution conducts psychological studies on an enormous scale, which touch on every aspect of our lives. It specializes in what it calls \"reshape response\", and this is taken directly from their manuals which I am fortunate enough to possess. In plain language, \"reshape response\" means that if a population group reacts unfavorable to a particular policy initiative, then that group's thinking is \"reshaped\", so that the response then becomes the required one. The Survey Research Center, worksvery closelywith polling companies such as Gallop and Harris, and can obtain gauging of initiatives, and in this manner can \"reshape\" responses to conform to what is required. Public opinion is no longer public opinion. What the majority of us believe is \"our\" viewpoint, is largely a viewpoint created for us. The campaign of Dukakis is a good example, because the turning point of his campaign was clearly discernable, only it was not a natural turning point, but a \"reshaped response\". The CFR had decided at that point to put its full weight behind George Bush. Since 1965, Eric Trist has been directly responsible to Tavistock and hence to Rockefeller, for setting up a network of so called \"organization development centers\"; problem solving think tanks in other words. It is a sophisticated brain-washing network which extends from factory floor to corporate office, from poli tical clubs, to country clubs, schools to universities; \"future shocks\" is administered to create controlled stressfull situations. The idea is to break individualism, and replace it with \"team spirit\", the words used in Tavistock manuals. The gist of it is that our rugged individualism, for which Americans are famous, is being broken down and substituted with \"team spirit\" of the kind that is displayed by a flock of sheep. This course ingroup dynamics teaches individuals to forget their individual personality and work for \"the good of the whole\". In Tavistock's own words; \"this presents participants with opportunities for increasing their understanding of group process, with particular emphasis on covert dynamics which occur in groups with regard to issues of authority, leadership and 0 6 9 -7-d"},{"pageNumber":806,"pageContent":"followership.

The sinister implication is obvious; once we like sheep have been programmed to act like mindless beings, we will follow the leaders and blindly accept authority. If enough of us accept the new automated cashless society, and live with a card instead of cash, the globalists will have taken a giant step toward breaking down the U.S. Constitution and the institutions upon which this republic's foundations rest. Resistance will decrease as soon as we have become accustomed to the system, and it will be a relatively easy matter to identify those of us who refuse to become a part of it. But being brainwashed to accept authority over personal freedom, the momentum toward a collision between the need for individual freedom based on a secured right to privacy and a central automated authority, is gaining speed. Fundamental differences can never be reconciled, anymore than we can be recokled to living with the Federal Reserve Board swindle. Computerized pattern recognition techniques, already in existence, have opened the doors wide to secret mass suweillance, which at present is with us in covert form, but which by the mid 19903, it is highly possible that each individual in this nation will be obliged to carry a card similar to the Soviet \"internal passport\". This card will be used for every conceivable transaction. No transaction will be possible without it. Is this card the \"mark of the beast?\" Perhaps it will not be called that, but whatever it is called, it will be an unprecedented threat to freedom and justice, liberty for all. The very latest intelligence information is that President Bush will make a major effort to require an identification card bearing machine-readable internationally identifiable numbers not visible to the naked eye for every citizen Everything will be embodied in that card. South Africa of ail countries has successfully shown the way. Each citizen is required to obtain and present on demand his or her \"book of life\", which contains every detail from the day of birth, even his driver licence number. Such a card instantly identifies one. By adding fingerprints and a voice print (remember the musical Christmas cards?), every person can be identified, especially if it is linked to the 666 computer inBmssels, Belgium. I expect to see this linked to every \"authority\" computer bank in the world, without regard to national boundaries or nationality. There is already strong pressure on the US Congress to upgrade driver licences. As Brzezinski put it, and I previously quoted this as far back as 1982: \"The instantaneous electronic intermeshing of mankind will make for intense confrontation, strained social peace\". Unfortunately the average individual knows little and cares even less about technology as it relates to politics and people control. It seems to me that the attitude toward such a card will be \"so what\", as long as it is possible to buy what is needed, watch football and hold down a good job, \"so what\". The convenience of the card, with which he is familiar, thanks to broadsides of propaganda, will override any anxiety we may have over this \"people control\" device. Those who have an understanding of the vast ramifications this card will bring, will be quickly isolated and probably rounded up, henceforth \"outlaws\" in the very real meaning of the word. 'Trend makers\" have been conditioning us, since the advent of the Beatles followed by widespread usage of marijuana, cocaine and deviant sexual behavior, female aggressiveness, Dr. Spock and so on. Trend makers are usually portrayed as young, attractive and successful. They are what I call \"travel poster types\" widely used to promote air travel or vacation spots. In the scores of years1 have travelled around theworld by air, I have never yet come across any real life \"travel poster types\" among my fellow passengers. Trend makers is an illusion"},{"pageNumber":807,"pageContent":"compatible with those travel poster types. , Older people are never used in \"trend maker*' advertising. Older people react strongly to change and an acceleration of change. There is a connection here between what Mr. Joseph Califano proposes for America's aged, and the wholesale marketing of euthenasia. Since older people are strongly resistant to change, the older people must be got rid of. This conclusion is based on a top-secret report, a copy of which was loaned to me for a few hours. Let me assure you that what I have just stated about getting rid of the eldery is fact, and not fiction. Human behavior follows attraction or repulsion toward the pace of life forced on individuals by society or some other group. This is where Tavistock's group authority comes into play. Most of us will be swept along by \"group thinking\". It happened recently in the 1988 election. We went along with the group and voted for a man many of us knew to be unsuitable to fill the vacancyin the White House. Trend makers have a specific target for future shocks change, and that target is the family. Transience has already weakened the most important unit in Christian society. We develop a relationship with our family, which today is being derided. Our throw away society mentality where nothing is built to last; \"dont fix it, throw it away and buy a new one\" has reached into our family life. The throw away mentality of economicimpermenance is reaching into marraiges. It was designed to do so -by the men at Tavistock, Eric Trist, Kurt Lewin and his associates. In 1980 I revealed what the Age of Aquarius-New Age was all about. In an audio-cassette, I told of what Brzezinski had in mind for us for our future, and Lthink it is well worth quoting again, because of its great significance and uncanny accuracy of his prophecy: \"Finally, looking ahead to the end of this century, the possibility of biochemical mind control and genetic tinkeringwith man, including eventually, the creation of beings that will function like men, and reason like them as well, could give rise to the most difficult questions\". In 1865 a journalist wrote as follows: \"Well-informed people know that it is impossible to transmit human words over wires for long distances and that were it possible to do so, the thing would be of no practical value.\" Just look at how far we have come since then. What was unthinkable in 1865 is commonplace today. What isunthinkable in 1989 mightwell be commonplace by theyear 2000 according to Brzezinski, and I have no quarrel with that. The globalists are creating a new society, not merely changing it. The bio-factory turning out human embryos is here. In 1962 Dr.'s Krick and Watson received the Nobel Prize for DNA research, and from then on, molecular biology research has exploded. New genetic information permits us to \"tinker\" (Brzezinski's word), with human hereditry, and manipulate genes to create a new man. This is political dynamite. Scientist Joshua Lederberg says \"cloning is already being done with animals\", and he suspects with people too. \"It won't suprise me if it comes any day now\" he added. \"But cloning man will come within the next 15 years\". Scientistsare at this moment discovering howvarious body organs work, and experiments to modify body organs is already at an advanced stage. The USSR and Stanford Research are busily engaged in experiments to modify human organs, especially the brain and its sensory qualities, and even growing brains. This will be brought under direct development control. The Hinckley, \"Son of Sam\", Jim Jones experiments were the beginnings of this period of experimentation. I have seen a copy of the report on just how far these experiments have progressed, and it has chilling overtones. The experiments are going on right now. In order to distract our attention away from this research, we have a whole lot of misguided people agitating against lab experiments with animals, and pouring red paint over fur coats, while they look the other way as aborted babies in theirmillionssilently scream inagonizing pain ending indeath.TruIy, we have been conditioned."},{"pageNumber":808,"pageContent":"There is a biological revolution going on, and it is rapidly gathering momentum. Dr. E. Hafez of Washington State University says that b&ed on his own research, a new form of slavery (my words), is going to be common-place within the next 15 years. Biological factories will sell frozen embryos. The potential \"mother\" will purchase the embryos and have it implanted in herwomb, having received an absolute guarantee that the \"baby\" when it comes will be strictly according to her description; color of eyes, hair and the sex of the child and its I.Q. Dr. Daniel Petruchi, anoted scientist in this field, says it will soon be possible to \"raise\" such children outside the womb. The impact of such \"births\" can only be vaguely comprehended at this time. Family life as we know it, will disappear, our traditions of motherhood, parenthood, child- rearing, education, relatives - no more grandpa and grandma, sexuality are going to be subjected to the severest of strains. The equivalent of the atom bomb is soon to be dropped on the family unit in society. The moral and ethical choices we will have to make in the category of future shocks, and worse than that, (morals won't come into it) will be in the political arena! We are at the point where selective breeding is totally possible. Races and super-races, the thing we roundly condemned Hitler for, will in future be acceptable. Given the absolute reality to tailor race to preplanned specifications, will there be superior or inferior classes? Are we on the threshold of a class of people especially bred to serve a \"super-race\"? If this- comes about, the negro and hybrid races face extinction. The pretended concern for the welfare of the colored races will be revealed in all of its ugliness. They will probably find that as far as the majority is concerned, the classification will read \"slave type\". Above the slave class will be a class of a higher order to run things, and docilely serve the super-elite; the Rockefellers and Gorbachevs of this world, i.e. the top echelon membership of the One World Government and their bureaucracy. The problem of bringing this all out in the open now, is not one of fearing failure from scientific and or technical difficulties; it is one political choice. Ethics do not come into the equation. Family life as we know it will become extinct. According to Dr. Hutchins of the Rockefeller Institute, many of us are going to feel an instinctive revulsion over the meddling with finely balanced far-reaching body systems that make an individual an individual and what he becomes. Dr. Hutchins said; 'Yes, it will be done or attempted. The pathway will be built from a combination of altruism and private profit\".. Compare this with the predictions of Bxzezinski: \"Finally looking ahead to the end of this century, the possibility of bio-chemical mind control and genetic tinkering with man, including eventually the creation of beings that will function like men and reason like them as well, could give rise to the most difficult questions\". With Brzezinski in the Bush cabinet, no doubt he will be engaging his attention to finding answers to those \"difficult questions\". He also talked about super intellectuals, super elite and world super culture. If this challenge to our Christian way of life and especially the family unit is to be met, then there needs to be a dramatic and immediate response to those who seek to destroy us as individuals. Changes must first be moderated, brought under control and then regulated. Rampant unre- strained change must be brought to a halt. When that condition prevails, we can turn our attention to eliminating the ideology of future shocks, a term invented to cover unrestrained changes unleashed inrapid-fire tooverwhelmus,so that like the soldier who fell asleep in the midst of battle, because he did not knowwhat to do amid the hailstorm of machine gun bullets,we too will succumb"},{"pageNumber":809,"pageContent":"to apathy. Instead of teaching relatively useless subjects in our schools and universities, our children and young people ought to have instruction which will prepare them to cope with future shocks; to be good soldiers, spiritually strong enough to withstand the shock of wild changes. If we do not begin now to resist this evil with all of our might, we are going to be relatively easy targets for future shock induction into a One World Government.

Last week, Skull and Bones, the old- est and most celebrated secret society at Yale, decided to admit women into the club that claims Mr Bush as a member. Do not expect him to mention it: he will adhere to the club's legendary code of si- lence as he did during the manoeuvring that preceded last week's decision. Founded in 1832, Skull and Bones re- cruited the \"best and brightat\" at Yale. Membership means adopting a secret name, dining at the club's \"tombn and taking part in such rituals as recounting one's autobiography and-reputedly- sexual history while lying naked in a cof- fin. Fewer than 200 of the university's 1,300 last-year students belong to similar societies. Now only \"Wolf's Headn- which claims Benno Schmidt, Yale's president, as a member-remains all- male. For the price of male bonding is high. The best and brightest, particularly those going into politics, find that they cannot aFford to sully their reputations with membership ofa single-sex club. But the Bones club's decision to mend its ways took six months of wrangling. Outgoing members chose six women and nine men as their successors; the first response of the club's governing board was to close the tomb. X postal vote of the club's 800 surviving members narrowly endorsed the admission of with Bones's bye-laws. Among the plain- ti% was a Washington lawyer who in- sisted that the admission of women would lead to \"date rape\" in the \"me- dium-term future\". The suit was settled when the club agreed to another vote, held as a share holders' meeting. More than 425 mem- bers came to the tomb to vote last week; the others voted by pmy.

CENSORED STORY: CIA Links to the Savings & Loan Scandal The massive fraud that lies behind the collapse of the Savings & Loan industry has always been underreported. Beginning Feb. 4. an enterprising reporter for the Houston Post started turning out a groundbreaking series that sug- gests the Central Intelligence Agen- cy was involved in some of .this fraud-with a cost to the taxpayer in the billions. When will the rest of the media ptck up the story? Reporter Pete Brev.ton's investi- gation implicated the CIA and orga- nized crime in the failure of 22 S&Ls. Sources told the Houston Post that 'the CIA may have used part of the proceeds from S&L fraud to help pay for covert opera- tions.' including possible support for the Nicaraguan contras. The collapse of looted S&Ls with mob and CIA ties will cost the govern- ment an estimated 513 billion (2/4/90). The ongoing series has docu- mented CIA interference in fraud prosecutions (2/8/90). and the involvement of President Bush's son Neil with a mob-linked thrift (3/11/90). The Post's research has led the House Intelligence Committee to launch an investiga- tion of its own. But national media have done little to bring this story to the pub lic. 'I can't think of a single inves- tigative breaking story that they've done on what caused the S & L cri- sis.' Brewton told FAIR. 'The papers that have the resources to really dig into this haven't been there. It's very disappointing.' FAIR'S representatives brought up the S&L/CIA story in separate meetings with Washington Post foreign editors (2/21/90) and the New York Times publisher (3/14/90): they had not yet heard about it."},{"pageNumber":817,"pageContent":"NEVADA AERIAL RESEARCH GROUP, P; 0.

Hitler said, \"... for this (propaganda) is also only a weapon, though a fright- ful one, in the hands of an expert\" (page 230). Fiighfful indeed! We can me the propaganda masten taking our he- dom and our fellow citicens (the \"m\" are practhuy begging them to do it. HCI is known for sticking to a hand- ful of basic lies or statements, which they repeat constantly. The result is that the average person (Hitler calls them \"the masea,\" while Lenin called them \"rwful idiots\") has these ideas hammered into hider, until eventu- idly they agree with HCI, and a~ won wu to HCI's side According to Hitler, \"N? the pur- pose of propaganda is not continually"},{"pageNumber":824,"pageContent":"to produce interesting changes for a few blase little mastere, but to con- vince; that means, to convince the masees.

Do you not see HCI using the same lies thousands of times, per Hitler's instructions? We are ref4 to as \"the lunatic fringe,*' \"gun nub,\" and \"bul- lies\" The scary sounding terms they use repeatedly, Buch as \"assault wea- pon,\" \"cop killer bullet,\" or \"Saturday Night Special\" are also hammered into our heads as a brainwashing tool. Add to this the slogans \"Has the NRA gone off the deep end?\" \"Haw many more have to die?' \"If we can save just one life.!' \"We're working to keep guna out dthe wrong hands\" ete, and you have a very dective pmpaganda campaign in use We are merely hearing slight variations of the main propaganda theme that guns and gun ownen, are the mot of all evil. They make sure that they stick to their main theme, as this is absolutely critical to the succeaa of their movement. Hitler said, \"All advatihg whether it lies in the field of business or of politics, will uvry success by contin- uity and regular uniformity of appli- cation\" (page 240). Hitler goes on to say, \"The great masses' receptive ability is only very limited, their undedadbg amall, but their forgetfulneae is great. Aa a con- sequence of theae facts, all dective propaganda has to limit itself only to a very few points and to use slogam until even the laat man is able to imagine what is intended by such a word.

Can you remember what you were doing nine dap ag4 what the lead story was on the news three days ag4 or jut one or two campaign pro- mieae that George Bush has not broken? In the beginning of the anti-gun movement, most people did not belicva the anti-gun lias They knew that all the .chrminP and dreaming would not eliminate crime, but rather that it would strip them oftheir liberties.

Simple, by not giving up on theu never ending pmpaganda campaign, they brainwashed more people into pining their side, including many who used to be -gun (at least seven of those \"Representatives\" that voted anti-gun had ~ceived NRA PAC money for their prior support).

The PBS program \"Frontline\" and the ABC News program \"Nightline\" offered similar versions on the Wry. There are several other crucial as- sertions in Mr. Sick's book: 4 The Caner Administration autho- rized its own private negotiations with lran through an intermediary in the summer of 1980. Mr. Sick, who served on the National Security Council staff under President Caner, said that a private citizen, whom he did not identi- fy, was met in London by an Iranian arms dealer.

Moreover, the accusations have been strenuously denied by Presi- dent Bush, former President Reagan and others said to have been involved. In a sense, Mr. Sick's book and the other journalistic investigations are battling not just. with each other over what really happened 11 years ago. They are also aimed at ConJZmSS, which is 'ust beginning a fractious Par- tisan deiate over whether to investi- gate the accusations. and how tha -House Rules Committee approved a resolution authorizing a special panel headed by Representa- tive Lee H.

The US'S recent record in the matter of judicial homicide--outlawed in 1972 but restored to legality a short four yean later- was sufficiently disgraaful before this latest manifestation of wickedly obtuse insensitivity. Just two years ago I recorded in thesc columns the barely credible details of an execution in Tew, one of the states which has opted for killing its unwanted malefac- ton bv lethal iniection. Resumablv nobodv had &thered tb look at the wretd~ed vie- tim's veins before he was led into the death chamber. At any rate, it was found, when it came to the mch, that all his super6idal veins were sclerosed because of his habit of \"mainstreaming\" drugs. They had to spend 35 agonisin mutes prodding around with a needle before they were able to b@g the obscene pantomime to a merciful end. Such extreme demonstrations of state- sponsored callousness and inhumanity may be rare in the US. but aslower. less dramatic form of pre-ex&tion toke is virtually routine. Condemned men and women spend many months or, more often, many years, on \"death row\" while a cumbersome appeals procedure runs its interminable and usually unsucassful course. At any one time some 2000 American citizens are kept in miserable confinement, living with the almost certain knowledge that their haI release can only come m the form of an injected poison, or gassing, or the noose, or electrocution, or (in Utah) a friendly nei bourhood firing squad. @this doa not constitute of a \"cml or unusual kind\", then I'm damned if I know what does. Aod this sort of horror cannot be largely blamed on bureaucratic bumblin and in- efficiency (dthou* thesc maie their considerable conmbution to the sorry mess). Instead it n5ecu the will of the peo ie. l!e rapid albeit reluctant) reversal by the Sunreme b urt of its 1972 decision that the diath penalty was \"unconstitutional\" was the result of a widespread public clam- our for its reinstatement. Earlier this year a condemned man in the state of Washington refused to accept a lethal injection and demanded that he should, instead, be hanged-an option which the state laws allow. But prison officials couldn't find a properly qualified hangman. They advertised, and dozens of ordiy citizens applied for the job, includ- ing a 7 year-old man and several women. Unfortunately, they all lacked the necessary expertise. and an out-of-state person had to be employed at a reported fee of around f900. And it is recorded that when Theodore Bundy, \"America's most infamous sex killer\", was electrocuted in Florida last January, parties were held throughout the country. . +Of. course, the US is by no means the worn offender. Last April, Amnesty Inter- national published a rt showing that 125 nations sdll retain theTath nalty , despite am ~e, turd statistical evignce thu u is inekcctual as a deterrent. Some two-thirds of all executions are carried out b just four coutri-Iran, South Afxica, &ma and Nigeria-and often the rite, as with thc stoning to death favoured by seven Islamic states, involves extreme cruelty.

Not that Britain can afford to be self-righteous in the matter: a majority of its citizens (includin the Rime Minister) would like to see tie scaffold back in use. If the inhabitants of the world can act so vindictively toward their kith (think of the current terior in China), what possible hope can there be for ucace and eoodwill between - nations? It seems to me that scientists and tech- nologists should search their souls before using their skills in the development of tools and means which might inacase the powm of men and women to distort, corrupt, repress or destroy the lives of their fellow beings.

In perhaps the most exciting mo- ment of this dramatic press confer- ence, Dr. Preparata gave an impas- sioned deferise of truth in science: \"I want you to understand that we are in a really serious situation, because our science is now dominated by an Aristo- telian ideology, and this is what lies behind the adverse reaction that we are getting to the results of cold fusion.

On two occasions, he witnessed sud- den bursts of excess heat .which caused his electrolyte to rapidly boil off, and once. when he removed his ex- periment from the electrolyte, he saw the beginnings of what he feared would be a runaway fusion reaction. To avert this he restarted electrolysis, thus effectively stirring the electrolyte in order to bleed heat more easily from the overheating cathode. Mallove hopes to have himself some confirming, positive results by the time Dr. Takahashi comes to MIT, where he is scheduled to give a talk April 15. Mallove warmly described Takahashi's collaboration with the in; ternational scientific community to replicate his experiment Unlike the case of hot fusion-in which nuclei of dm (the heavy isotope of hydrogen) are accelerated to high speeds so that they will crash, into each other and fuse into -a new heavier nucleus-in cold fusion the ie markable metal, ~a11adiu.m~ is used -to promote the fusion react~on. Takahashi uses a palladium cathode (positive electrode), with a plate-like. shape and a volume of 0.6 cubic centi- meters. Using electrolysis, he pumps deuterium (which is liberated by elec- trolysis from a heavy-water electro- lyte) into the palladium,. in a ratio above one atom of deuterium to each atom of palladium. Other groups in Ja- pan, Italy, and the United States.are repeating his experiment In response to one reporter's obses- sive demands for an explanation of why some scientists had been unable to reproduce the Fleischmann-Pons results, Preparata explained that cer- tain criteria.had to be met in the load- ing of the cells--that is, the procedure by which.deuterium is caused to be absorbed into the palladium metal lat- tice. But once these are met, compe- tent experimenters can and have regu- larly reproduced the phenomenon of cold fusion. Preparata pointed out that cold fu- sibn scientists are being subjected to a double standard. There are experi- ments that go on in the solid-state physics lab, in which the accepted phenomena are much more difficult to reproduce than this one. Onen things go wrong But no one ever questions the validity of the phenomena, be- cause these are done in the labora- tories supefiised by Nobel Prize win- ners who are considered unassailable, Preparata asserted. . \"You are dealing with a subtle pro- cess here which must be explained by real scientific thinking,\" Preparata said. Then he directed an impassioned 'appeal to the audience that they, espe- cially the laymen, not be dissuaded from fighting for scientific truth. \"Fot the sake of your children, for the sake ofthe future ofhumanity, we must fight this stranglehold on science that af- fects us all.\" . . .

But Nixon ran with manic zest. slandered his op ponent as a communist and returned a winner. ' In 1947 Dewey had recruited Nixon's vote to helpestablish the CIA Dewey liked Nixon's mod pragmatism and his fitrce anti-communism.

In a few years the Syndicate's hotelcasinos there were earning an estimated annual profit of $100 million. Batista arranged for legislation that guvanteed a gambling license to anyone investing S1 million in a hotel. The Cuban government not only matched such invcsuncnts dollar for dollar, but it also waived corporate tyrcs on all hotclcasinm.

Nixon was inuoduced to Crosby by Bebe Rebozo, the Florida entrepreneur who had becane Nuon's best Wend Crosby kept an account at Rebao's Key Biscayne bank, a relationship that Watergate investigaton later stumbled across when they began looking into an allegation that Rebozo's bank was being used to Iaunda Resons conuibutioru to Nixon.

In 1966 Rcbozo's Cape Florida Development Corn- pany had bght up $1 million in prime waterfront lots on Kcy Bisuyne. Reborn had trouble selling them until Nixon posed fa a promotid picture with Rebozo's partner. Donald Berg. a man the Secret Scrvice latu found so dimputable that it stopped Nixon from eating at Berg's Jamaica Inn Rataurant in Key Biscayne. (The reason fa the Secret Scntice's brushoff was Berg's connection to a Syndicate front man - a 1960 Nixon campaign contributor - who had ken insaumend in estab- lishing Lansky in the Bahamas.) Reborn gave Nixon a 33% discount on two undeveloped lots. One lot had a mortgagc held by Anhur Dessu. a director of the Miami National Bank. which Lansky q#gedly used to launder money skimmed from Vegas casinos. Nixon kept his tie to Desser unadvertised by not recording the deed to the lot until the mongage was paid off four years later. As president. Nixon perfected quid pro quo. Whtn he took office. thc major remining symbol of the Kennedy's Syndicate- busting legacy was an irnpnsoned Jimmy Hoffa.

Onc month after Nixon moved into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Bob Haldcmm sent a top-senet mema to John Ehrlichman: \"Reborn has been asked by the president to contact J.

He succeeded in confusing the trail enough to conceal most expenditures - and in burying the identities of the slush fund's moneygivus where they could not be exhumed. But thcre was one critical exception. a 5 100.000 donaion from Howard Hughcs. B y 1968 Hughcs was close to becoming the world's richest man and Robcn Maku was cn#onccd as Hughes's chargk d'affaires on a S 520.000 annual retainer. In the spring of 1968 Hughcs handed Mahcu a toppriority insuuction: \"I want you to go to scc Nixon as my special conlidcntid emissary.

A month after the election Hugha decided to conmbute to Nixon's private ache. In Dcccmbcr 1968. Maheu took 550.000 in 5100 bills from the cage at thc Silver Slipper casino and flew to Palm Springs where Nixon was attending he republican Governors AssociationCon- fmncc. Maheu told the Watergate committee thu he drwe to thc house where Nixon was staying and waited in the car while a cwon went inside. Appuatly it was Hughesf intention that the money be delivered to Nixon persondly. a high-handed and risky procedure at which Nixon balked. Mahcu rcmed to Vegas with the 550.000. Shortly thereafter. howevcr. Rcbozo sought out Richard Danner. the ex-FBI agent who 20 years beforc had inuoduced Nixon to Rebozo. Danner had worked on he 1968 Nixon campaign. then had bcen hired by he Hughes organization as a \"Nixon liaison.\" Rebozo broached the subject of money. Danna told the Watergate com- mittee. by needling hi about Hughes's supposed favorifism toward Hukn Humphrey. gnmbiing that Hughes had donated more to Humphrey's 1968 campaign than to Nixon's. According to Senate testimony. Duma twk this message to Maheu. who agrccd to send money to Nixm through Rebozo. Hughes had at least four favors in mind: Hughcs had just lost a major defense conmct because of advcrsc publicity that devclopd when a House subcommittee found that his moncy again had bas wining and dining top Fcnugon gcncrals. Now Nixon was in a position to cut off he major mvkct for Hughes's lagging hclicopccrdivision by ending the Viernun war. So Hughes sau a mano in early 1969 klli Maheu he \"should get lo our [new] friends in Washington to set what could be done abt keeping the war in Vietnam going.\" (By 1974 Hughes was ctnm0y.s eighh largest Pentagon amtractor, with backlog orders of 3825 billiaa. becoming so much a pan of the dcfcmc csublishmmt ht Nixon offered to have Henry Kissinpr brief Hughes UI tbc antiballistic missile sys=) Hughes's second ccmCM was he Atomic Energy Commis- sion's (AEC) testing uadct the Nevada desen He feared the afurtffa and he felt Ihe tests were saaugicdly worrhless - as he explained in rnorhumemo to Maheu: \"Of cowsc we must k careful not to place ounelves in the position of disclosing military secrets. But I un tell you, based upon actual Defense Depament tdmid infannuion. legally in my hands. that this last AEC staurnent is pure 99 prwf unadultentcd shit\" (Con- frorued with Hughes's axxagonism. the AEC did move iu testing ground from Nevada to Amchitiu Island off Alaska, at a cost o uxpayen of s I00 million.) Third, Hughes needed approval from the White House kfae he could. uke ova Air West airliines. (Hughes received Nion's pcnonal g+ahcad in 1969. just about the time the fat $50.000 insdhent - S 100 bib cinched in bank wrappers and stuffed in a manila envelope - was delivered to Rebozo.) Fountr, Hugk wanted uuiwt laws waived so he could purrtrw the Dunes Hotel. Hughes already had bought up five big hotclcsinas md by late 1969. was angling for the 1000 mom Dunes. But the Junicc Dtp~rment's antinust divisim opposed granting Hughes an even bigger monopoly on Vegas.

But Danner told the Wucrgate committee Ihu, in actuality, Mitchell felt Hughes had mt really ZITated Ihe Syndicate's standing in the casinos.) The yun later. when Walcrga investigators began beating on Lht Whiu House door. Rebozo kame alarmed that the 5100.000 from Hughes would be discovend. At 8 a.m. on April 3(hh. with Nixon about to announce he exit of his While House front line before nctwrkTVcyneras in the Oval 0fZice.Rebozo hurriedly confcned down the hall in the Fish Room with Nixon's personal lawyer.

Howard Hughes's 5100.000 paymen to Nixon's secret cache almost certainly would have stayed undetected if Hughes had not fued Roben Maheu in November 1970. For more than ten yem Maheu had handled assignmenu for the CIA and the Hughes organization. In the espionage. business and crimi~J ne~herworlds. his connections were invaluable.

Intenel was born in he Bahamas. the offspring of Resom' anti-Syndicate posturing. Intenel was supposed to be a private police force to keep gangstas away from the casinos. What Intenel became. however, was a private CIA-for-hire thu,~lied on computa data. political IOUs and inside connections. The Intarel president. Roben Peloquin. began his cpea as a manber of the mwp society. He worked fa Naval Intelligence. the National Security Agency and the Justice Depmment's Security Diuision. Thcn he had been chief of Ihe Justice Depart- ment's fit Organized Crime Task Force, a job that got hi acquainted with Resorts. Peloquin was che prosecutor who m- vestigated Resoru and initially rrparted that \"Lhe atmosphere seems ripe for a hky skim.\" But in 1966 he suddenly retired from the Justice Dcpartmcnt and went to work for the CLA front group Rcsau.

According to a Hughcs insider. Pcloquin and Davis reached a tcntativc agreement. Intmci would rcplau Mahcu as the fix-it expert in the Hughes organization. And Hughes would replace Rcsoru in thc Bahamas. (By 1970 bky had become as reclusive as Hughes, hiding out in Israel. vying to avoid the lingering reperrussionsof Bobby Kennedy's hs Vegas investigation. The Syndicate did not want anothcr major investigation in the Bahamas. But already some investigative rcportcn were trying to uncover Lansky between the balmc sheeu. Hughes could provide a much better front: his antiSyndiate stance in Vegas was still unmpromised) For Hughcs it was a chance to put Lhe Western Hemisphere's two prcmium gambling centen in his me. Hughes already had contempiatcd moving to the Bahamas. Hughes representatives had mct with Resorts executives during the previous year to discuss thc chance of buying up the Bahamian franchise.

Some research connects it to Fmmasonry and Gnosticism. Most connects it to the medieval KnightsTemplan---some to both. ' Either way, it is an organ'aation with a dusky and shadowy past that is cloaked in honor, ethics and charity. There is a Catholic arm and a Protestant arm. Currently, Five Continent Grand Master is Andrew Dertie. Ilowever, the absolute head is Pope John I'aul 11. The present-day Knights br Malta, otherwise known as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), is a 900-year- old, exclusive chivalric order. This ancient order of knighthood existed even before the Cmsadn. It was founded under the name of the Ilospitallen of St. John of Jerusalem back in the eleventh century. Like Frcrmasonry, it likes to promotes itself as a charitable organization. Nevertheless, the Order has a political and military side to it, and it is a supreme powerbroker. When the Turks invaded the Holy Land the Order of Malta beme a military unit to defend Jerusalem and prnenn it and its holy citles obtenslbly for Christianity. Its own literature describes its historical room \"When Jerusalem was lost, they (the Knights) moved to Acre. A century later, when the city also fell to the Moslems, they moved to Cypnrs were given the island of Rhodo by the lIoly Father and thy held it for many centuries against the Moslem invaders. Ultimately, the expansion of Islam drove them from Rhodes, and they wm given the care of the island of Malta which they governed as a sovereign state for 300 yeas until, in 1798, Napolean forced them to sunender the island\" Its later history claims: \"After the loss of Malta. the Knights wandered from place to place until 1834 when Pope Leo XI1 established the Ileadquarters of the Order in Rome ..J he Grand Mastera or the Order continue to enjoy the rights of a head of state, as. the Sovereign Military Order of Malta has.. place la the world of diplomacy and statecraft. Today mote than 40 countries recognize the soveieignity of the Order of Malta and maintain full diplomatic relations with it. 1n.addition. there an oflicial delegates of the Order to various states and in ternat ional organizations. The Moly See and a number of' nations have been and arc recognizing the Order of Malta as a sovereignity, in as much as it enjoys prerogatives which according to principles of international law, are proper to sovereignity.\" Clearly, this \"charitable\" Catholic order is a government itself. And this government answen only to the pope. The pope who legitimized it, Lco XI1 (182 1-1829) condemned all religious freedom. tolerance, Bible societies and . Bible translations; and declared that 'Everyone separated from the Roman Catholic Church, however unblameable in other mpects, has no part in eternal life.'\" I 'The current ' Pope, John Paul, holds exactly the same perspective. The internatioml head of the Order, the Grand Master, is elected for life. By Papal. Decree and by vlme of his once, he has the rank of Prince, the precedence ofa Cardinal, and the title Mast Eminent Iiighncss. SMOM appears to have ties to monarchs- and powerful, wealthy aristocratic families mainly In Europe. Its politics appears to be far-right. It has clear bonds to the C.I.A. . SMOM has chosen to 'honor some dastardly individuals. In 1948, the Order issued one of its most prestigious awards of honor, The Gran Croci al Merito Con Placa, to General Reinhard Gehlen. He was Adolph IIitler's anti-Soviet spy. Following the war, Gehlen found a home with the C.I.A. (so too did other Nazi war criminals). American industrialist, J. Peter Grace, once the American head of SMOM, personally intervened to get Nazis out of Europe and into America - Grace used his influence to have Nazi war criminals' prison sentences reduced. Nazi Otto Ambros who ran a plant within Ausschwitz, used over 100,000 hapless Jewish prisoners as laborea. Though he was found guilty at Nuremberg for his part in war crimes, Ambros found employment with Grace. Also, the son of a high-ranking Nazi, Frieddch Karl Flick, a key financial supporter of Hitler, was also tried at Nuremberg and found guilty ofabetting the Nab cause. Yet, Peter Grace brwght Flick's son to America and put him on the Grace payroll- Social historian Stephen Binningham has said of them: The Knights of Malta comprise what is perhaps the most exclusive club on earth. They are more than the Catholic aristocracy ...I they) can pick up a telephone and chat with the pope.\" Research by Bttty Mills indicates that \"In the 1930s. there was a military pact to seize the White House. John J. Raskob, a member of the Knights of Malta. was implicated in.thii ... An attempt was made to have Marine General Smedley Butler take a lead in this plan.\"2 Instead, Butler secured damaging evidence against the SMOM plot to seize the White Iiouse. IIe exposed the plan: John J. Raskob, one of the thirteen - founding members of the U.S. branch of SMOM and .board chairman of Genersl Motors, was implicated in the coup attempt. Congressional hearings were"},{"pageNumber":869,"pageContent":"held on the plot, but SMOM kingpin Raskob was never called to testify. \"It is interesting iind ai the same time very disturbing to note that the 1930s plot to seize the White louse is not to be found in history boob or encyclopedias . as far as we can tell,\"^ writes tkcty Milk The SMOM enjoys such power and connection to other seat societies thrwghout the world that it can exert tremendous impact on global amain. Though somewhat puzreling, SMOM combines powerful resources with other shadowy, coverf organizations to complete an objective. For example, one or two covert groups might want to accomplish a clandestine operation. To do it successfully, it might appeal to another group(s) for assistance. When this happens, an ill -assorted consortium will work together evm though they might be at odds philosophically, religiously, or financially. In the Novmber-December 1990 Timnpet, the foundation for a case existing between the Prieure de Sion and John Paul I1 was made. Despite Malachi Martin statement that the Pricum is a myth--that it does not exist, we believe it does and is, in fact, worltmg in un'uon with the Vatican of John Paul 11. In Tlie Musiurlc Legam the authors write of the manner in which secret organizations come together, pool resourrm then quietly dismantle efforts and return to autonomy. The authors write: wNevertheleu,. it had become inaedngly clar that the Pricure de Sion did have interests, and did conduct activities, in a somewhat murky sphere -.a sphere where Christian Democratic parties of Europe, various movements dedicated to European .unity, royalist cliques, nco-chivalric orders, frnmasonic sects, the CIA, the Knights of Malta and the Vatican swirled together, pooled themselves temporarily for one or another specific purpose, then disengaged againw 4 (em- in the original). MATRIX 111 These alliances of conveniences operate on many fronts through high finance, international conglomerates, intelligence networks, education, religion, media, military, politics, various think -tanks. Cross fertilization of individuals and groups occur. For example, Knight of Matla, William Buckley, is also a member' of the Council on Foreign Relations. Another Knight, Frank Shakespeare, a U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican, was also President of CBS Television Services and . Vice Chairman of RKO General. Shakespeare joined ultra-rightist Paul Weyrich when the former became Chainnan of the Board of Trustees of Weyrich's Heritage Foundation. Incidentally, . Weyrich has traveled to Moscow to help the Soviets establish a \"democraticw system of govemment. The Heritage group also brought Karl Von liapsburg to America as a speaker. The Hapsburg dynasty is the primary fom behind the Pan European Movement Other past and present members of SMOM are: Lee Iacocca, Greek shipping magnate, . Spyros Skouru, Nixon friend, Robert Abppplanalp, Bamn Hilton, John Volpe. William Simon, fonner treasury secretary, Alexander Ilaig, William Buckley, Bennett Williams; attorney for the rich and famous, and Willii Casey. Is toby's SMOM, the neo -~emplar organization, aiding Pope John Paul I1 in his quest to extend Europe's boundaria, and to become the major player in the new world order? Yes. Two CIA Directors have been Knights of Malta. For example, John McCone, William Casey held membership in SMOM as did George Rocca former deputy chief of CIA counter -intelligece. More than adequate information exists to link the SMOM, the ultra-right wing, the Vatican and the CIA to the Iran Contn Affair. Behind what was made to appear as an anti-communti eKort in Central America, ,was another plot. Evidence from the hearings clearly indicated that a shadowy govemment within the U.S. government was in operation. Exactly what it was attempting to accomplish remains murky. .Perhaps members of SMOM working in allaince with other covert organizations in the world were attempting another coup of the White House similar to that in the 1930s. The goal?. Chaos. The result? A .Vatican -inspired revolution within the United States .that would eventually force -the ~+csldGt to tn6d (hi Fi;b'crr\\ Emergency. :,Management Agency (FEMA) and begin martial law. ,Important pieces of information that surfaced during the Contra hearings was Col.

Thcy can depose world leaders and entire gwemrncnrs at will. lhiu gives them an unharnessed power to shape and create a prototype world government.

Perceptively. the authors of The Messianic Legacy conclude that 'the seeds were thussown forthe growthof a shadowy subterranean subculture in which secret and semi-secret societies - religious. political and financial - would .soon begin to flourish. By the late 50s. this subculture had assumed a momentum of its own. comprising a milieu which. although invisible to the outsider. began to exercise a more and more pervasive influence. When therefore. the American journal The Spotlight reported in its May 20. 1989 issue that the Bilderkrg Group. wting earlier that month on the idand of LaToja off the Atlantic coast of Spain. had plotted the political assassination of Margaret Thatcher 'because of her refusal to yield British sovereignty to the European superstate that is to emerge in 1992.' the intended manipulation of Britain's supposedly danoaatic processes is entirely consistent with the foregoing conspiratorial - rather than 'cock up' - theme. As The Spotlight observers have long detected, a European superstate. with no trade barriers aniong the western Europcan nations and a common currency. has been on the Bilderkrg agenda for years. being 'viewed as a major step to~t*ards their gnal nf a w~orldgn\\~ernment and creates a favourahle climate for huge banks to consutile smill OIKS and huge international conglomerates to absorb small firms.'

So 1 think the physiologist is right when he advocates the 'Commission for Genetic Control', so that research and practice keep in step. It is most devoutly to be wished that such a commission will be more effective than international organisations have been up to the present. The German word for life (Leben) spelt backwards means fog or mist (Nebel). We should raise the mystical veil of mist with caution so that we can comprehend the reality of our existence. The intelligent robot is on the way1 It will think independently and have an intelligence quotient far exceeding man's. It will be equipped with sensors which 'see' better than the human eye, for they will also see in the infrared and ultraviolet range. It will 'feel' more intensely, because its sensors function more sensitively than the human tactile sense. Its feelers - supersonic waves, radar, X rays - will 'feel' through walls. The American scientist Marvin Minsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, says: 'The machine will be able to tell a joke and win a boxing match. Once this stage is reached, the machine will develop at fantastic speed. In a few months it will reach the intelligence level of a genius and a few months later its power will be incalculable.' . Dr George Lawrence, scientific director at the Stanford Research Institute, California, has already linked human brains in direct contact with computers. The power of thought alone is sufficient to give the computers orders.

In the meantime, it is enough for good Catholics - as skeptical as we were - to refer to the words of Jesus: \"By their fruits ye shall know rhem\". As has been demonstrated by Archbishop Lefebwe in his letters numbers 9 & 10, that for the past thirteen years the revolution in the Church has been carried out exactly according to the plans outlined by the Masons, - published some sixty yean ago.

I think this tumor was started a long time ago for disinfoniiation purposes. Allov me to state a theory supported by evidence. Financial, political, and intellectual forces (The Order) created and/or subsidized a secret, fraternal, senior year society called Phi Beta Kappa at Yale and several other knerican colleges during the American Revolutionary War. Phi Beta Kappa's Purpose was twofold, function as a \"think tank\" atd \"recruitment cell\" for the elite.

From The History of Fhi 3eta Kappa by Oscar M. Voorhees, official Phi Beta - Rappa historian and member, we surnnerize some of the following: (Incidentally this book was published in 1915 and is the first hiitten history of Phi Beta Kappa. Voorhees took fifteen years to vrite it.) Hamward was founded in 1636; College of William and Hary (1693); and Yale (i701). phi Beta Kappa was established 5 December 1776 at College of William and Hary. In 1350 during the Revolutionary War a Phi Beta Kappa chapter called an \"Alpha\" was established at Yale College and then another \"Alpha\" was established at Haward in 1781. Phi Beta Kappa had a secret, Masonic ritual; was associated with many of the most prominent men in the country at that tine, and was a \"senior year society.\""},{"pageNumber":875,"pageContent":"MATRIX III In 1782 becaus; of the war, Phi Beta Kappa's existence in Virginia at College of William and Mary ended and Phi Beta Kappa became exclusively a New England institution at Yale and Harvard. It was the only society in early American education with branches in several colleges, bound together by a cornnon name, connnon insignia, comon purposes; and the institution had a special affinity for meeting on Thursdays. The Phi Beta Kappa chapter at Yale proposed the dissolution of the Society after the reoublication in 1799 of a book published two years before in Scotland called proof; of a Conspiracy Against All he Religions & Governments of Europe -- Carried --- on in the Secret Pleetinps of Freemasons, Illuminati, and ~eadinfiocicties by John Robison. The reason given was that some members were convinced \"that skret societies have been improved as engines of intrigue and iniquity; and considering the time, place, and circumstmces vhich gave birth to this Society, and the probable designs of its institution which are deducible from the import of its initial letters; ... they were apprehensive that this Society, tho at present harmless, is liable to,be abused to the infidel and seditious purpose -. Ill of other secret associations. (Emphasis by underscore theirs). How many members joined in this action is not known but probably few because Phi Beta Kappa functioned as a secret \"reading society\" for another twenty-five years. Antimasonic political party made its appearance in 1827 and vas active in all of the New England states for ten years. It was the outgrowth of the \"Morgan affair\" in 1826. William Morgan was thought to be murdered by some men who were Xasons because Morgan published a book vhich vas said to reveal the secrets of Freemasonry. The Masonic fraternity suffered severely from the public outcry. against this incident, and so fierce was the sentiment on both sides that in New York, New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Xichigan political parties, church congregations, fau,ilier, and friends were divided on the issue. The result wzs, that during the next few years hundreds of Masonic Lodge warrants vtre surrenderd. The Antimsonic party ran a candidate, William Uirt, for President in 1832 and wan seven electoral votes. In 1631 there occured a Masonic-Phi Beta Kappa scandal (See enclosure \"Phi Btta Kappa and Secrecy\"). At this time Phi Beta Kappa renounced all of ihe, oaths of secrecy required of its members and adopted an amendment that new mercbers be elected by a --thirds vote. In short Phi Beta Kappa ceased to be a secret society by 1632.

For your information Z am enclosing a recent article concerning the OSJ printed in AXIOS, the Orthodox Church Journal. It will give a good brief history of the Order. The other enclosed items will also give a sense of the level at which the OSJ operates to-day and its public purposes. The Order has nothing whatsoever to do with Masonry, either in the. USA or in Europe. In fact, membership in the European Masonic Lodges is an absolute disqualification for membership in the OSJ. American Masonic Lodges are not considered seriously and'therefore membership in one of them is not a disqualification for membership in the Order's Grand Priory of America.. The Order considers the Knights .Templar organisation associated with Freemasonry to be merely a commemorative group and not a continuation of the Order of the Temple of Jerusalem. However, the genuine Knights Tem- plar continue in existence and are validly chivalric Knights: They to- day exist in two genuine branches, one headquartered in Portugal and one in Spain. (The Templars owing allegiance to the Portuguese Grand Master also have a Swiss-based affiliated group of Autonomous Priories.) The Grand Master of the Portuguese-based Templar Order is Count de Fuentes; the Grand Master of the Spanish Templar Order is Prince William 111 de Grau-Moctezuma, Pretender to the Aztec Throne of Mexico. mu rbr bawrul prnmm .i QI Onbmbu 6b1~1b 11) Aamta mn bpl aC.nn ri flu fiurcp &a( peln 33"},{"pageNumber":878,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 Prince John de Batemberg is Grand Chancellor of our Order and also Grand Prior of the Grand Priory of America (which has jurisdiction over all the Americas and the Caribbean areas).

Now, with all this behind us, as it were, comes the moment to discuss some basic issues of how to work on non-dualistic states of consciousness. There are clues to the interrelationships between the factors of consciousness, energy, and matter strategically placed in this book - to address such matters to people who may be steeped in social consciousness is not easy - one must be quite creative, as humans are, by nature, a \"tough nut to crackn. There are many human disciplines which address the issue of non-dual consciousness. Research indicates that many of these disciplines have three essential factors in common: Factor 1 (Fl): Active Attention is the primary factor. It consists of intense yet relaxed alertness, coupled with total acceptance of what is happening in the present (NOW) and the total acceptence of any tendencies which arise within your consciousness. Imagine sitting with the light blocked out from your eyes and no sound around you, if you will, and mentally address the Void around you, saying \"Speak, I am listening\", and simply be attentive. In Vendanta Hinduism, this is also spoken as \"Who am I?\" or \"To Whom Have These Thoughts Occurred?\" In the Zen discipline, it is accomplished by the use of the KOAN (\"What is the sound of one hand clapping?\"), sometimes called the Great Attention, functionally an inquiry into the Source of Thought. In Tien Tai, it is represented by the factor of active inward attention. Perhaps the most viable expression of (Fl) is in the Taoist sense through the concept of Wu-Wei, essentially a state where there is no volitional activity at all, a state of letting the mind absolutely alone, totally authorizing all of the tendencies of the mind in an impartial and non-judgmental way, allowing thoughts to flow by as clouds in the sky, with no intention present. If properly performed, Factor 1 leads automatically to: Factor 2 (F2): Stopping, which is a state where metal chatter \" (represented by the personal ego\", which is inclined to chatter, without control, purely for the sake of communicating and attracting attention to your personal image) comes to a halt. Visual image formation also ceases. In Vendanta, it is a state of mental introversion where objective perception ceases to exist. In Zen, it is seen as a state of consciousness that is functionally a state of oneness, called the Great F,ixation, where there is no thought received by the brain. In Tien Tai,"},{"pageNumber":880,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 it is seen as a state where conceptualization ceases. Taoist discipline calls it a state of Fasting of the Mind, where there is no thought or mental activity. This state leads to: Factor 3 (F3) Passive Awareness, a state of consciousness where you are, in essence, \"seeing into Nothingness\" in a.timeless NOW. At this point, the mind is in a process of non-dual awareness; it is referred to as the \"I-I\" in Vendanta terminology, the state of Prajna in Zen, Kuan in Tien Tai, and the Great Tao. From this information, and perhaps your own experience, you will quickly realize that: (1) Thought is one of the root causes of dualism. (2) In-attention builds images. What? In-attention builds images? The state of active attention is a state of FOCUS. Think of the question in the beginning \"Speak, I am listening\". If you were to say that to a person, you would have a focus, waiting attentively for a reply. It is that same state, represented by continuous FOCUS, that is Active Attention. When you manage to lose the FOCUS, it means you are, in essense, losing attention. When you do, images and thoughts pour forth. Truth It appears that humans want to find the truth - that is what their constant search seems to be about, yet, what is truth? If you read something and gain knowledge of it, is that knowledge true? What does truth really mean? You want to learn the truth? Take the knowledge and theory that you have and undergo Experience, for through Experience actual' learning occurs - Experience leads to Wisdom (which is non- dual in nature -neither \"goodw or \"bad\" - it simply IS). From the Wisdom, you gain your own personal truth. If you could gather up all the \"personal truthsw within the consciousness comprising the Universal Intelligent Matrix, THAT would comprise the TRUTH (with a capital \"Tw) that humans are always looking for, but can never find within a consciousness steeped in dualism. I AM THAT I AM If you earnestly pursue the process at the beginning of this chapter and take all the other knowledge in the book that has been provided, you will realize that: ].No amount of looking in any direction will help you see WHO is looking. Perception, by its very nature, requires dualism. You can only perceive something by being separate from it. When you BECOME what you are perceiving, you can no longer perceive it, because you"},{"pageNumber":881,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 are BEING it. 2. Whenever you think about something, you objectify it. You can only truly know something if you become it. 3. The absence of your personal self, the Void, is what is looking. Humans anthropomorphically call this \"God\". 4. You cannot perceive your Self. You can only Be it. 5. You cannot see what you Become. (That's why everyone around you is a \"mirror\" to you. When you see some- thing you \"don't like\" in someone, it is that portion of you that you are perceiving and rejecting, auto- matically projecting the perception off onto that person! If that portion was not within you, you would not be able to recognize it. No \"thing\" or event has any inherent meaning except the meaning you assign to it. STOP PROJECTING. When you feel that something \"out there\" is AFFECTING you, you are projecting! 6. You can experience union with your Self/God/Void only by Being it. What is it? It simply \"IS\". In the Bible reference is made to \"I AM THAT I AM\" - that is WHO you are! Everything and Nothing. 7. Nothing and no-one \"belongs\" to you. If you want some- one to \"be something\", that reflects your lack. 8. Concentration cannot be a permanent condition, but only a transition between the projected world and Being. Phases of Concentration Intellectial Phase: Thoughts are directed to the object of concentration to consider what the object reallt \"is\". The thoughts are the bridge between ignorance and knowledge. Feelinn Phase: Consciousness projects outwardly through the nervous system all the characteristics of the object of your concentration so that you feel it. Being Phase: You become identical with the object. You become it in consciousness. Complete concentration results in being the object of concentration, which means that you will no longer be able to perceive it any more because you are it. 9. It appears that the more \"in tune\" you are, the more. you notice the \"coincidence\" or synchronicity that is always there. A good example of synchronicity would be that you are riding down the road reading a book about alligators and you look up and notice a shop that sells . alligator handbags, or you are talking to someone and - - n~s?"},{"pageNumber":882,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 a nearby radio announcer says what you just said. The main significance of synchronicity (think back to the chapter on holography) is that it tells you that every- thing in the universe is part of ONE thing, and that the ONE thing simply \"IS\". Synchronicity is the conscious perception in a physiological time-track spacial reality structure of the simultaneous manifestation of the multi- dimensional existence of the ONE. All events, objects, relationships, points of view, perceptions, and inter- actions are different parts/perspectives of ONE. Because of the inter-connectedness of all points in the universe, nothing happens \"by accident\". Look around you and notice how well orchestrated everything is. Put in another way, everything is ONE EVENT experienced from different points of view. Conscious recognition of the synchronicity around you means that you are in harmonic resonance with what is around you and you can act on the opportunities it brings. 10.Mind is a product of the physical material wor.ld, and is created out of the multiple orders of electromagnetic field when consciousness intersects with those fields. 1l.Consciousness exists apart from mentality, which is created by consciousness. Consciousness is represented in physical realities by its generative reflection as mentality. 12.Consciousness does not really \"move around\". What you perceive moves around you. Everything is just a \"point of view\". 13.Doubt is a 100% trust in a negative reality. 14.Anxiety is excitement with judgment applied to it. 15.Accuracy is a judgment that there is one truth against which everything else must be measured. 16.The Truth is composed of all truths, all of which are equally valid. You experience your truth. 17.Humans encounter beings and realities equal to the vibrational resonance at which the humans exist. Part of that resonance is genetically determined. l8.You ARE the path you must follow. The chosen path you are is to develop self-awareness and consciousness and choose whaty reality you will experience to fulfill the idea of what you are (which can be potentially anything). 19.What ARE you?

You can only judge yourself while in"},{"pageNumber":883,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 separation from your Self. 20. The brain is a quantum-based amplification and receiving organ that provides an interface with this density for consciousness. It is an event-forming psycho-mechanism through which consciousness operates. It provides a connection with cellular and molecular time sequences that are coordinated with the time-track lock of the physical body, synchronizing them with the surrounding dimensionality. 21.Social consciousness encourages accumulation of knowledge which is not based on life and experience. It produced individuals who are of an impersonal nature, functioning through the lower structures of the brain. 22.If your attitude is based in social consciousness and your persona, you become the slaves of those who will manipulate you for their own purposes and you give up your self-empowerment. 23.The idea of going from density to density is in essence the process of realizing that you actually ARE the dimension itself you previously thought you existed IN; your consciousness ultimately has access to it all. 24.All beings reflect all the ways infinite creation has of looking at itself, of experiencing itself to be. 25.Victims are the worst tyrants. Tyranny is the active suppression of another under the guise and aims of the persona. The persona chooses its own victimization. 26.In social consciousness, the concept of \"now\" is based on the \"past\", which is a repeat of what is already known, so \"now\", in effect, becomes \"future\" based on \"past\". Is it any wonder that people in society depress themselves, because it means that \"future\" is failure. Conversely, people who live in the \"past\" are doomed to their \"future\" In the NOW there is no \"past\" or \"future\" as linear ideas. Everything in your life can be created NOW. Can you see the potentials that lie there? Can you contemplate these potentials? Contemplation leads to options for change, which leads to knowledge and subsequent experience, which leads in turn to wisdom and truth. 27.People cannot be in your life unless they reflect what you are. What does that tell you about what you are doing? Are you playing the \"victim\"? Are you feeling unworthy because you-have to feel \"hurt\" to gain affection? 28.Whatever you live, you will create in reality."},{"pageNumber":884,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 29. If you keep having the same kind of experiences, it is because you have not owned the wisdom in those experiences. Ask yourself, \"what is the learning here\"? 30.Most knowledge on the planet at this time is built upon fear and survival, which are the hallmark of people operating in the lower brain areas. It is also built on judgment and separation, as well as the tacit \"understandingw that man is a \"fallen\" creature who has no divinity, thus leading to the process, through religion, of psychological projection of one's Self externally, calling it \"God\", subjecting oneself to a priesthood, and becoming totally disempowered as a being. Combine this with other psychosocial factors, and you basically have a planet populated with the \"walking deadw who have no idea who they are. Any knowledge that is taught that reflects \"lawsw to control and limit human beings, or divides the ONENESS into \"good\" and \"evilw aspects, is coming from human beings (or non-humans who wish to control humans) who have accepted that as being their personal truth and who are compelled to have the world revolve around that personal truth, and that personal truth becomes a reality to be experienced.

MAIZIX 11: lZE ABDWION AND WIPULATION OF HANS USING ADVANCED mNOLOCY. 3rd Mi tion Updated With New Haterial. LEADING EDCE RESEARCIf CROIP, 1991, 8 1/2 x 11, Velo-Binding, 660pages, 1400 line-item index. Tbis book is probably one of the most influential book8 to appear on the planet. Its first two editions sold out planetwide ss of June 1990. It is rumored that some alien Spt?cleS have secured a copy, and tk US Coyemrent has also apparently acquired it. The original CIATRIX, issued in 1988, set the stage for this incredible piece of work. Ml7ZIX 11 is more than a look - it is a journey into both your awareness and tbe awareness of other ttpecies, no matter who they are or where they wme from. The book, now in its 3rd edition, updated in July 1991, encompasses an incredible range of data which includes precedcntal research on hum= abductions by both government and off-planet forces - material that other authors will not speak of and what publishers will not allow .the-lves to print. After the buok was released, other researchers -began to catch on to what hw been occurring. Val Valerian weaves a wide rmge of interrelated waterid into a literary experience that will rock you to tbe core of your very beiag - one that includes expansion of your very consciousness as a side benefit. Included within the book is the now famous Wide Spcctrun Chronological Database, a large section of hypothetical analysis by The Nexus Seven, data and updates on underground bases at Dulce and the Nevada Test Site, a large number of illustrations, .aps and charts detailiag activity sites, undergmuad installations and tuanel networks, commentary by John bar, Robert Lazar and a host of other top-notch researchers. Valerian takes us through the whole gambit bi h, why, and by whoa humans are manipulated, information about government connections to the abduction proccss, post-abduction problems, and things that the abductee can do. The book is the first to adequately relate reseurch oa memory functions relative to the abduction proc~~s, virtual reality machines and Eeichian pmgrauing, aad mind control by human and alien maaipulators. It also discusses the abduction of human children and how to handle wustment of the child to the experience, multi-generational scenarios and cases, human multi-dimkional anatomy d irw it can be maaipulated by techaology, and elements of advanced techaology possessed by the governreat. There is more information about tbe various species known as the Greys in HAlRIX If than there has been (or probably &er will be) published where. Pcrbaps for the first tin, we get glimpses into what Grey society is like, what gtvup awareness is about, and what their attitudes and mind-sets mean to Imrans. There is additional data on the Reptilian species who are dominant over the Greys, and what they ray have planned for humans in the coring yeers. Tbere an overviews of the processes and rationale for implanting humans, as well as cmss-sections and tecbnid data gleaned from extracted alien implants during 1991. Elcctnmic space societies (wbicb the bvth will become in the near future) are discussed. lk book ha an incredible spectrum of information hut alien influence on human society, historical facts that are had to come by, and much much more. Them is just so much data in this book that i t would take pages and pages to describe it. Best of dl, the book integrates tbe positive and the spiritual aspects and illustrates hor awareness can bring evolvement out of situations that people do not prefer. The book is the death-knell for planetary domination-based control systems - the whole domination/control game and its accompan~ing social manifestations (and what is ultimately behind then) are exposed for all to see. MTBIX 11 and the researcb of Valerian and others he includes in bis book also spells the, end for -classical Ufologyw with its at tendant wUfologistsw, -expertsw, and most of the 3'' organizationsw that are here today. It also exposes techniques tbat intelligence and security forces use to have influence over people .ad teaches you why they are doing it. Through the book, we can see how alien interaction brs affected wave after wave of civilization on this planet, ir~ecting elemeats of adverse technolo# aad mind control, and how the suppression of human awareness is being performed and supported.
