Everyone connected with it has had (and continues to have) land- mark experiences. Matrix IV, as a book represents a whahn of signi%cpnt para- digms that represent a selected crosssection of reality during the linear period of 1993 to early 1994. The mere presence of a paradigm, idea or concept in Matrix IV should not be tahn by the der to imply that that paradigm is to be encouraged for adoptlon or non-adaptlon by the reader. We are not asklng anyone to \"believe\" anything. In common terms, what you are reading is not necessarily the mind set of anyone producing the book - the book consists of a presentation of mind-sets, if you will, that appear to be significant enough to be represented for infomation and research purposes as a means of assistance to the reader in reality evaluation based on your ongoing personai experience. Any fianl conciusions you draw, actions you perform or don't perform, belief system you adopt, etc., as a result of reading Matrix IV are entirely your creation as an act of will and are no one elses liability or asset unless you decide to make it so as a function of psychological projection. Readers are advised to conduct their own research as a function of their own experience before coming to definitive conclusions and subsequent modification of their dty struc- tura The Master Control Paradigm of Physiologically Mected Perception and the Elohim Since our bodies ph-ysically exist well within the photon-band, mostly under the controi of the Elohim-based hierarchical paradigm (since they provided major genetic modifications to the organic pb~iology of the human body and continue to upgrade it relative to their own agenda), many things found in hlntrix IV (the Flower of Life paradigm, etc.) refiect various aspects of that Master Control Paradigm (MCP), while at the same time giving the reader knowiedge of some of the infrsstruc- ture of the MCP that will hopefully promote a more expansive viewpoint beyond the MCP. Be aware that you are functioning to some degree within a controi panuiigm while at the same time examining some of its fUnctions Functions of the Elohlm MCP manifest themselves hierarchidiy as subordinate interlinked paradigms that simply promote the overall MCP objective, to control consciousness relative to other beings and to gain energy and psychological power as a result of that control. AU control paradigms on Earth reflect that agenda, and involve coercion of will and focus of beings into areas benefiting the MCP objective. Today, some of the forms that MCP control manifests itself are seen in the NWO, human genome research (preparing to take control of genetics on a human lwei to act as a hierarchical control force for upper MCP structures), dweiopment of virtual reality technology-, electronics and EMC, light-based computer and electronic technology, human social control para- digms. the \"New Age\" literature and things to \"keep humans busy\", amongst others."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Outside the photon band and the operating area of the MCP lie the conscious- ness aspects associated with \"Christ Consciousness\", \"Avatus\" and other forms of hlgher vibrator?, consciousness. Very often the MCP makes reflective use of truths that lie within the realms outside the MCP to lure \"humans\", in a lock-stock and barrel manner, into MCP control paradigms. ,In common terms. ideas and concepts immediatety mco@zed as \"inherent trutbs reflecting the nature of rerrlity'* are combined with MCP ideas and concepts and \"humans\" accept it all witbout quesiion, 'because those few inherent \"buthsw appear to maice the whole thing \"feel right\". all tnteractlons wlth allen bebp you have heard of stem ltom overf0nes~w.y up to the photon band, but no further. There is a chart later on in the book It is apparently also characteristic for eacb level of control paradigms to be reMvely oblivious to all the areas in whicb it is controiled from the levels above itself; in addition, eacb level will try to protect levels below itself from any discovery that would led to itself. Talk about a tangled web. AU this is chamcteristic of control prvadigms up to and including the pboton realm. All paradigms can be taken as bclicf symms. Belief systems structure reality interpmtdon and affect perception, and have the caplrcity to generate additional belief systems. They are also very seductive. By adopting a belief system as the oiral rcprcsarta6ion of your reality structure you put youself in a position where you may be manipulated or led to a point where you are manipulating yourself according to an objective not your own (unless it is a knowing, conscious, effort of will to crerite an oparardcd expanding reality structure). So, keep this in mind. There is a lot of wduable information in the paradigms included in thii book - there is also informa- tion that, if combined Into a dosed reality structure, will result in a certain degree of MCP entrapment Simply puf them is ah information in pamdigms which has not necessarily been shown to be the case upon further investigation. Ever?, paradigm you run across in our cult- contains elements of \"disinformationw which is eventually revealed through experience. Some of tbat will be obvious. and tbat in no way reflects that the soume of the pamdigm is necessarily negative or deceptive in nature, but reflects a different perspective which stems hm different beliefs and experience. Sice the entire gestatt of Absolute Consciousness of the Universal Intelligent hfalris (which \"overshadows\" and includes all MCPs, since they are \"partSculatel' reality structures) automatically results in expamion of separative viewpoint, MCPs are at this time in our society being pushed at full tilt in order to attempt to **counteractw expansion. For example, if you *lbelieve that seeing the light is the ultimate objective and that human genetics is evolving according the the light-code instructions revealed in the Keys of Enoch\", besides buying into a belief system, you are also buying into the MCP created by the Elohim, who have nwer led an embodied esistance and haven't a real clue what love and compassion are really about Yes, literature like the Keen reveal part of the technological infrastructure of the Elohim genetic photon- based control paradigm, but to consider \"human evolution\" having that as its find objective is doing you, the occupying entity, a disservice. Most of the channeled"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV information available in society today (but not all of it) comes from within the first three \"realms\" of consciousness that stops at the 3rd level of the photon realm. Most of the activity that we view culturally as \"human-alien interaction\", whether \"the Pleiadiansw, \"Bashar\", \"the Greys\", etc, all lies well below the realm of Christ Consclousness and the Tao. So does the cultural conflict between \"the Nazis and tbe Jews1*, which is an arranged divisory activity which on a higher level involves the Jahovah complex, also existing with a limit of the photon realm and having intercon- nection with similar control paradigms. Various aspects of the Elohim - Jahovah mind set appear to be additionally manifesting themselves culturally at different levels in such a way to attract certain eiements of the human population relative to specific hnctional states of brain operation. For example, the Keys of Enoch appeal to tbe intellectual curiousity of humans, and the Raelian Group (displaying a symbol that is a curious combination of the six-pointed star and the swastiska) concerns the sensual area What is emitted by higher levels bears no resemblance to light It is a higher frequency than the photon realm. It is just something that all particulate beings who are a part of the Absolute Gestalt work through on their way. What we are also looking at is a progression of events based on interaction with polarity-based paradigms (see the \"Theoretical Progression of Planetary Para- digms\") that eventually results in a blending, in the wake of physical and psychic trauma of the polarities into a balanced format allowing progression into multidi- mensional awareness and capabilities This ultimate blending might not be seen on this planet for another thousand years - but it will occur. Meanwhile, try not to get too caught up in events while experiencing them. Relax and use Matrix IV as a tool for your om evolvement and group discussion. -Matrix IV, thanks to the effort of MT and AAA, also represents one of the premier works on Mind, Body and Consciousness It contains more information relative to perception, brain processes, and spiritual factors than probably any work in existence. You may need dirrgrams on the brain and Matrix III by your side, as well as a good dictionary, but if you read and understand the nature of the paradigms presented, as well as the Magnum Organum, structured by MT to fdfdl the oved purpose of Matrix IV, there is no possible way you can go wrong in terms of accurate evaluation of any literature that exists, or my reality paradigms you choose to adopt in your life. You would really have to be dead from the neck up not to turn your life around after reading and undedanding Matrix IV. Reading the book will take time, focus, intent and determination; Matrix IV was designed to be one of the most usefhl works you will ever come across in your entire life. Remember us kindly when you pass it on in your will to your children. iii"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Matrix IV is the product of a team effort, and I would like first of aII to express my sincere appreciation and admiration for the effort, will power and forti- tude put forth by Michael Topper and AAA during this process. The.paradigm of the book is one that lies outside of time and space, and most people will never understand or appreciate the sheer effort of will it took to put thii together. Michael and his wife have had to endure health problems, lack of sleep, fires, earthquakes, mud slides, and an untold number of physical and psychic events designed to extend the Great Work destined to manifert itself as Matrix IV. In addition, both of us bave hrrd to contend with vanishing files, mysterious computer problems and other factors which would most certainly defeat all but the most determined individuals Part of the wisdom on my end was learning not to pronounce linear completion dates on a work that was most assuredly non-linear in nature - the apparent \"delays\" in the production of the book were beyond any ones control. Like a fine wine, events deemed that Matrix IV would come to completion according to a wd s&& that would dictate the point of its final manifestation. which of course was a learning experience in terms of patience when looked at from a strictly linear point of view."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Never has one piece of work been so'fraught with cosmic delays as has Matrix IV. From the cosmic intrusions into the life of MT, the black helicopters flying from the bay right over the house with guys leaning out with black bores, the California Fire, operations and health problems for AAA, files mysteriously disappearing from computers, concerns about planetary conjunctions and timing, re-entering correc- tions. and a host of other events (all seemingly indicating that h¶atrix nT is deemed by some to function as some sort of cultural hinge-pin relative to the transformation of society), it has taken the better part of a year to assemble this book I think you will agree that it has been well worth the wak The original discussions about a year ago centered around the fact that there is so much material out there (from Bashar to Marciniak and the Pleaidians. a lot of New Age hype, and twenty million boob that reflected twen@ million perspectives) that people did not bow whether they were coming or going, and had no wav to evaluate the bulk of material outside of cultural and religious belief systems Furthennore, a lot of material was suspiciously absent in literature available to the general public, resulting in a literal \"trip to nowhere\" every time they went to a bookstore - they felt no better about their acquisition after they got home than before they went in the first place. This. we thought. was rather inex- cusable, so we jointly decided to set forth on a project to accomplish the task as we saw it Matrix 117 is the result of this journey. -4s some 01 you might have observed over the last several years, the Matrix books are not simply grander versions of the same thing - they reflect an evolution in consciousness which is passed on to the readers worldwide. and it has proved to be instrumental in the personal development of the reader. This is the whole point If you have ever attended various \"ZrFO Conferences\" over the years. you will note that it is the same people doing the same this in different ways from the same state of consciousness - social consciousness. and that the whole thing is depndent on a worid view that is rather myopic Sure, there a;o the thrills and chills of listening to people who have been abducted by government. militar?, and apparently alien forces. operated on and discharged in a flum of indifference, all amidst an air of fear and power-control drama The thing is. for a problem to be solved it must be approached from a m;Srerent of cons~usmss fiom the one in which it was crd or ob- served That. my Mends. is one of the key missing \"links\" in the continual series of \"conferencesn.

It is wirtuaily guaranteed that more people will be doing this as more people begin to do it ( tt makes a cumulative contri- bution to the morphogenetic field for the human form). Lastly, the focus of con-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"sciousness is important Is the focus on fear and lack? What is the focus centered around in our lives? Another problem is the perrPpPive &&emid bdwm \"b&f qrstuns\" and er- paiurcc Beliefs have nothing to do with experience.

Our planetary civilizption, wholly bound within various belief s-vstems, is on the bnnk or a lantastlc transtormatton. As thls transtormatton approaches and certaln aspects of social structure are becoming rather transparent, the structure of society is breaking down. With nothing perceptible to replace it with, people are getting a bit fearful and nervous. A certain restlessness has developed in the lives of people - a feeling that something big is on the horizon. One of the things that is missing here is a more expansive perspective. Many of the things that are happening now are under- standable from this larger perspective - a perspective which includes new knowledge about the cyclical nature of civibtions, the geometric nature of consciousness and Mi structures (or the lack of them), and the nature of the apparent \"contestw be- tween polark hierarchies Covert cultural manipulations are becoming increasing& transparent to a dis- satisfied population (much of this manipulation revotves around acquisition and con- trol over pemonal energy) - it gumtees the end of a way of life, within tbe next bvo decades. that has been based on deceit and manipulation. The recent presidential \"electionn in 1992 might be one of the last ones - the fact that \"the game is riggedn is also becoming transparent, and the idiocy of \"the systemn is becoming obvious. MI over the planet, people are looking for answels to all of the grand questions Shy of them are ulooking for someone to follow\", that \"special set of beliefs\" that will \"make the differencen, a \"savior from the skies\" or a \"profound religious experience\".

The difference now is that so many individuals are qeriatcing the same thing, it is actually acebating 41;pcriencCs fm more pw* because of the effect of the morphogenetic field relating to the human physiological form', the grid of third dimensional consciousness, and the changes that are overtaking the planet itself. One of the side-effects of this increasing perception - a perception which is closely tied into intuitive function - is that more and more individuals are wntemplat- ing the nature of the core processes which relate to life on the planet. A result of this process of mass inquiq is that we are finding some answers. Historical data about the nature of the \"human\" species and various cuttural activities invohing fairly advanced societies in Ebth's past, as well as other important information, has been viciousl?r suppressed. One would think that a discovev of what has actually happened on this planet would tend to confirm and support our intuitive feelings relating to what is happening on our planet right now. It does, and it is partly what Matris IV is all about - putting our awareness into a progressive historical perspective and applying it to our current experience. Investigations seem to indicate that the fractal nature of the \"timewave\" in- cludes periodic areas of \"resonance\" - this means that portions of the wave are the same or similar during periods of time that are \"resonantn with each other. The cur- rent period of time we are in is \"resonantn with a period in the Middle Ages over 1,000 yeam ago; this same period in the Middle Ages was one in which the Universe was undergoing reinterpretation, as well as one in which various \"plagues\" ran ram- pant The Middle Ages was a time in which the Church disseminated its views on how \"God\" and \"Devil\" ran the Universe, and a certain sense of \"spiritual security\" reigned for a long time. As time passed, this \"spiritual securityn lessened when the wiewpoint became transparent It was then quickly replaced by secular security and the empirical method. The LTnivese then became an \"unknownn mechanical puzzle to be dissected down to the smallest particle.

We are also faced at this time with new understandings relative to the nature of the physi- cal world, and how it relates geometrically to the whole of Creation - how eaistence and time have been intertwined in a series of nested cycles of varying length - all headed toward a massive trrmsfonncrtion to occur very soon.

Amoon Traveling down Figueroa Boulevard J - driving, AAA fiont seat, MT back seat. Approximately 2:43 p.m., MT had one of his infiequent Fire Visions, i. e. Saki burns up the whole reality-framework momentarily and replaces it completely with waking image of another realil)., physically as tangible as the first but more \"&earnlike\", visionary. With this sudden Vision of replacement-reality, MTstill %ding in backseat of car\" but it is nocturnal scene. \"We\" seem to be winding along a road which is psychically impressed as-very emphatically-Topanga Canyon Boulevard Large manimd houses recessedfiom street, indicative of the area. Streetlamps are burning, give impression of glowingfireflies. As we move through the \"turn\", the curving vista gives out upon scene where focus of observation passes mmerous children in Halloween costumes floating dreamily along the sidewalk little groups breaking of down a drive or walkway, some standing on porches ... As the view moves through its curving angle, one of these recessedporches bast colonnades of overhanging foliage) catches the attention; sitting at the edge of this porch is a carved, lit pumpkin, a glowing Jacks '-lantern Communicated instantly through the Vision is that this Jacks '-lantem is God Conveyed along with the impression, unmistakably, is that it 's not only \"god-in-the-abstract ': but Meher Baba in particular. The vision is very brief probably doesn 't take more than two seconds of real time, though it's leisurely-enough \"in context\". Image-realil). disappears, replaced without transition by 'baking reality\" of F. Boulevard MT subsequently expressed this vision to Southern Crown students, later in the decade, without comment. The meaning of the above Vision (August 1983) is now made clear to one and all. This Introduction to Matrk N is being penned only a few days after the Great California Fire of '93, which was started by an arsonist in Calabasas and ended half a mile fiom the doorstep of AAA and MT. The decisive break-boundary of the fire, where the firefighters made their dramatic \"last stand\" before the blaze leaped into the Pacific Palisades and threatened the whole Santa Monica area, was announced over international airwaves as... Topanga Canyon Boulevard. The fire was begun a day after Halloween but was preceded by adjacent (set) fires that blazed just before and during Halloween. The massive and greater fire considered here, was lit in Calabasas. Calabasas is Spanish for \"pumpkin\" (thus the Vision of a Jack+'-lantem, or Pumpkin with a flame in it). In the Vision, that pumpkin was intuitively recognized as God, and not just god-in-the-abstract but Meher Baba in particular. For those who may not know, Meher Baba, the Iranian-born Spiritual Master and proclaimed Avatar of the Age (died 1969), lived in India in a place called 7he Pumpkin. Meher Baba is renowned for having gone into permanent silence early in his teaching work, communicating only through a letterboard thereafter; he'd announced he would break his silence only when the world reached its ultimateleleventh hour cnsis, at which time he"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"MATRIX N promised to speak the Word that would redeem the world. It is assumed by the dubious that he failed to break his silence and speak that Word owing to his physical death in '69 which, according to observers, was unaccompanied by speech. instead, he wrote the number 31 on his board. It's presumed, even by his loyalest followers, that this written number was a predictive referral to his date of death. Yet, as we observe in the MT piece Motto-in-the-Lotto, if this were all the \"3 1 \" signified, the Avatar of the Age would have departed with a gesture placing him approximately on a par with the Amazing Kreskin. We suggest, in the above article, that 3 1 is indeed a \"Word\" in the sense that \"number\" signifies vibration, and 3 1 is a particularly po- vibration. Therefore at the very least it's a Key, and indicates the Initiation of a Process which, while not so obvious and literal as an overt enunciation on the lips of a \"particular person\" may nonetheless be interpreted as a true fulfillment of the Promise in a larger and more subtle sense. Thus a reassessment of what it means for the \"Avatar of the Age\" to \"break silence\" and \"speak a Word\", seems very much in order. At this late juncture in the historical climax of the whole Earth-sphere, it seems imperative to abandon childish understandings in favor of a real sophistication especially toward appreciating what an avataric presence really is and means, how it should be properly identified and received, and why its function is of greatest significance to the planet as awhole and each person in particular... Wait a minute! Wait a minute, MT! We thought this was an Introduction to a Matrix book! What's all this about fires and avatars and words! We expected to hear about reptiles hm Draco, secret scalar technologies, Nazis under the polar caps and other edifying st&? Isn't this another book by that wonderful Val Valerian, who has tirelessly alerted us over the years, in his periodical Leading Edge and those unprecedented volumes, to a whole alternative universe of hidden knowledge and activity exploited by the international power elite at the expense of the world populace? Isn't this another book by that same W who has blown the whistle on the most outrageous \"secret shd3'\" about the hidden government, covert spacealien pacts, Illuminati con- spiracies, germ-warfhre pogroms conducted against the citizenry and brainwave manipulation through FCC airspace? If we wanted \"guru\" stuff, we'd go to Ram Dass! So bring on the bioscience, regale us with Clinton clones, tell us more about the grey abductions in twilight and the implant in uncle Albert's sinus! Yes, this is a Mm book by the great W...but it isn't another Book. AAer all, what would you want with just another Mm Book!? Weren't the last three, about 1,000 pages apiece packing enough information on the secret science, alternative technologies, alien civilizations and shadow governments to keep you busy in that zone a while? Don't tell MT you've read it all, understood the whole thing perfectly well and expect to pass on to more-of-the-same ... Should the reader have approached this volume in glowing anticipation of the same fare as has fomerly been dished in Matrixidal abundance through the previous three, one would begin to suspect literary Bulimia. Only a binge-and-purge cycle could account for any such further craving after a repast already served in such colossal proportions as to keep a speedreading Farouk fed for a millennium! Instead, the astute reader should be making best use of the earlier volumes through fiequent recourse and continuous study, especially since the format of each largely takes the tone of presentation rather than interpretive conclusion; those volumes, volcanically over-boiling with an aggregated mass of rare and non-ordinary materials, were not given =--nor were they conceived in--the spirit of a definitive viewpoint. As the MT introduction to volume 111 proposed, they constitute the generation of an adequate paradigm, i-e. they suggest the sufficient outline of a Pattern capable of accommodating the kinds of reality yielding progressively unignorable evidence to contemporary"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV sensibility yet commonly screened fkom acceptance, concession or acknowledgment according to profile of the receding paradigm. Indeed in the previous introduction it was suggested thaf only with Leading Edge/Mafr& and Southern CrownlThunderbird materials had a paradigm been adequately prepared proportional to the true cosmic scale of everyone's oncoming Reality, so that only there (in those Sources) would really be found a sufficient Pattern able to accomt for the anomaly of every negative and positive thing, pelting--or soon to pelt--the exposed epidermis of everyone with unfamiliar Hailing fkquencies. The reai question wasn't, then, Quo Vadis Paradigm? (since such had already been accomplished) but rather what to make of the seemingly monstrous Pattern emerging, like Godzilla fkom Tokyo Bay, out of the contemporary Matrix? Thus this present Matrix volume really serves thefirnction conducted by the previous three; but that function is largely an educative function, a means of suggestion and guidance through the Lighting of dark passages and the opening of sealed doorways otherwise largely unknown to the general public. Let others, then, continue to feign Commanding their X-files from backlogs of old Vince-and-Gladys-Gad& material, let others continue down the initial Matrix lead already chiseled along the mineshaft and posted with flambeau, for that's the only way they may proceed4ong paths already well marked-out by the reai pioneers. A thousand thousand writers will now tread the level plateau wed by incisive machete-slash of the Leading Edge and overflown by the colossal Thunderbird, for that's the only trajectory they're capable of negotiating: the one already blazed, and satisfactorily planed to a safer horizontality where the far-less bold and agile may find nonetheless the foothold of a profitable niche. It is, after all, these Legions of come-lately-with-infinitely-less (who, snifEng a whole New World of potential exploitation opened by the true Psychic Magellaus begin trickling in like ants toward picnic leftovers and then swarm the field in a scavenging free-for-all) that the general public would tend to follow. ..for the larger reading public, subiiminally fi-eed in the latitude of allowable Vision by those initial Clearings conducted by the pioneers, inclines \"naturally\"--as function of collective inertia4ong the line of least resistance as well, which is exactly the \"horizontal\" plane traced out by the push already imparted: \"inertia\" is, after all, the tendency of an object placed in motion to remain in the line of that motion unless otherwise deflected by some countervailing force. Thus the inertial tendency of a public set on a particular \"scent\" is to follow all the literal exemplifications and versions of that scent, accommodatingly furnished by late-arriving literati hacking aromatic blubber off the carcass of a Leviathan already landed. The natural tendency of the public left to itself, is to continue picking over carrion packaged and suitably marked-up by hacks in the literary abattoir, wholly absorbed in the \"new stuff' and generally unable to distinguish spoor of the first fresh kill hm litter-ary tailings dragged to the market by vultures. The perennial public tendency is to nosh happily at the new lunchwagon, linger forever at the next wateringhole- getting minutely and greedily \"into it\", inspecting and appraising the fascinating \"sluff\" as with a jeweler's eyepiece, conversing and discussing and debating endlessly over progressively more lifeless minutiae. It's easiest, of course, to perceive the presence of the folk-folly in \"othersW--so the alternative-energies maven will express exasperation at the chronic questionmark of the UFO-buff, endlessly iterated (in punctuation of every fuzzy 8rnm strip or wobbly out-of-focus video) within"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"MATRIX N his characteristic ring-pass-not as \"could there be?\" \"and if so, how?\" while the abductee-group remains nonplussed at the cold distancing evinced as the limit-of-participation by the average alternative-energies advocate..And each within the comfort of his enclosure, willing to amas the respective types of \"evidences\" and anecdotes forever. Yet it's obvious, by sheer enormity of the zone out of which these identity-specialties tend to proliferate on the horizontal plane, that the View as a Whole opens on an emergent non-ordinaty real@ progressively unimpeachable precisely in proportion as the psychic &ni& sale their niches in the New Territory. As opposed to the general inert absorption in incidental minutiae of the landscape, the actual Presence of that emergent reality begs for a means of mapping it. Once opened, a new territory must be charted. Therefore while the folks on the dock necessarily chatter about the e~stence of that New Land, and speculate extravagantly as to its nature4 the more since shared ignorauce allows unfettered flight-the original voyagers who first raised the cry remain mindful of its immediate demand. After all, the entire Matrix of exposure regarding the shadow government, hidden technologies, alternative worlds, beings from the stars and interior dimensions reveals thefimctional existence of an UnRnavn Universe; that Revelation does not convey, as its primary importance, so much the alarmhg intelligence of your secret betrayal and ongoing exploitation, as the greater Knowledge of your continual existence in parallel with a Non-ordinary/Unknown Reality the nature of which leaks into, impinges upon and affects everything belonging to the blindered byways of the %nown9'. While the mass is ever preoccupied, then, with anecdote and incident \"about\" that alternate universe, apparently content to tell ''tales of things unseen\", those original Explorers 6ciently astute in the first place to detect that Presence beyond the mapped-out boundary-line of the bbknown\" (just beyond the misty limit of the meridional comfort-zone) conserve the clarity-of- intent that drew them there; they maintain the steadiness of Eye to recognize that the merit challenge presented by the fi of that larger Reality, takes its bearhgs in the Question as to how to map such reality, how to make this formidable New World Territory fhiliar, turn the Unknown to the knowable (to permissible bits); in the ongoing steadiness of that opened Eye, the very formidability of the proposed task provokes the further necessary question Who is there to do it? Who will give sure knowledge, understanding, wisdom and true insight regarding these things that are merely anecdotal to the mass of 3rd-stage (i.e. Eorth) consciousness? Is it the \"spacealiens\" we find inhabiting this Territory, who will do it? Is it the multiple-channeled sources beaming in of late, from zones-unknown? Many there are who jump to the af5mative willy-nilly when these \"solutions\" are proposed: after all, they \"reason\" (using the term lightly, of course)--these beings areporn that Unknown Land, therefore they ought to be best qualified to tell us about it, describe its features, teach us its rules and laws, equip us to travel fkly in its field ... However, there are those already Light-enough on their own to understand these \"sources\" present precisely the terms and unfamiliar magnitudes that are in question to begin with. How can one accept \"tutelage\" albeit very tentatively, fiom the lion whose lair you would negotiate? How wise is it to unquestioningly accept riding-instructions from the very, wild roan you would ride? Then what's the alternative, MT? Surely we feel more \"comfortable\" getting our steering fiorn someone who's here on the li# r@ right along with ur over these dark waters, rather"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV than getting our instructions from something \"indeterminate\" swimming alongside the boat; but how may we be taught about those Deeps themselves, by someone with whom we share the familiarity of the raft? since he is, precisely, on the ra$ and is therefore a \"3rd stage\" earth-focused form of consciousness just like ourselves! What would such flesh-folk know of the briny deep? However, the flaw in the perception here is precisely the leveling idea that everyone \"sharing the life raft with you\", i.e. decidedly \"incarnate\" in the flesh body of 3rd density-style Earth consciousness, is @so facto a specimen of 3rd-density consciousness alone-that is, on a par with yourself and therefore no more qualiied to teach the Deep Ways than you are. This flaw in perception has led to two, equally invalid forms of \"reasoning\": (1) The commonality of the shared incarnate state makes everyone automatically a democratic equal in terms of right, or authority, to expound upon the mystifyin% things; thus there are those (usually found today on the New Age circuit or advertising in Whole Life) who presume themselves adequate to the task of explaining, peddling or pontificating on the Mysteries by default, since to them there appears no one sharing a \"birthday suit\" less blindered than themselves (i.e. it's \"safe to say\", for who is there to say \"my\"?) (2) No one sharing a flesh vehicle with-and-including yourself is qualified to teach Mysteries of the Higher (an angle which is, equally, of democratic comfort). Indeed the modem trend is to encourage such enforced egalitarianism in the form of \"anti-cultism\"; the thrust of this popular conflagration is governmentally fired, and fanned by the compliant media Governmental arson in this case is easy to understand; the power elite does not want the competition of real Teachers or Teachings, plain and simple. If the government wants you to \"find out\" about the Non-ordinary reality with which it's had commerce for years, it will introduce and condition you to it its way; and a dose of Thallium dessert to anyone who sees it differently. Disabused or \"deprogramed\" of the notion that any embodied being may brief you on the Greater Wisdom (except perhaps a special-case, past-tense-only exception such as \"Jesus\"- who of course was very popular with the government of his day), you are left wide open to be \"introduced\" to extraplanetary or transdimensional denizens selectively approved behind the scenes, and represented as your providential \"saviors\" hm all that sudden welter of woes fatefully unsolvable within your failing familiar context (i.e. just those \"woes\" ensured in their insolubility by a power elite polluting your livingspace and then legislating your last-line-ofdefense nutrients out from under you: welcome to 4th density, slave-state style). The lie in the above litany of conventional wisdoms is exposed in the significant knowledge that beings of constitutionally \"higher\" densitycorrespondence or rapport do share, and have to some extent always shared, your fleshly estate; and they've done so for two interlocked reasons. Since beings from 4th to 6th density have shared and do share the incarnate 3rd density condition with you, the reasons for their doing so vary in proportionate priority according to the effective densityarrelation of the given being. The Rays And Offices The 4th-to-5th density beings elect to share the 3rd density condition first of all because the unique, inertial resistance of screened 3rddensity limit acts as an intensified catalytic agent for progressively-transcendent awakening. The rationale is that \"3rd density\" acts like a low-set springboard; the higher the dive onto the board (i.e. from the beginning, mid- or late 4th density etc.) the greater the repercussive spring and consequently the higher return loft. Thus 3rd density"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"acts as an initiatory expediter for taking degrees of awakened consciousness beyond those presently enjoyed at the \"higher\"--but less catalytic-levels. The \"secon~\" motivation for 4th-to-5th density beings is that of serving the awak- ening of the 3rd density beings amongst whom.theyYd take incarnation, as the very meam of accelerating their own knowledge, understanding and wisdom. For the comparatively few 6rh density beings electing to take 3rd-density incarnation, theprincipal motivation is that of teaching/awakening 3rd density beings, of expediting themher initiations of incarnate \"4th\" and \"5th\" density beings, and secondarily of serving the acceleration of their own \"advance\" to the degree of Oversoul consciousness (which begins at mid-6th density). And although it's fair to say that many of these (constitutionally) higher-density beings \"descend\" originally hm either spacetime or timespace loci similar or identical to the ones hm which SBUCeTfok beam and channel-entities broadcast, respectively, it must be noted as a cautionary fact that for those pledged by long-term initiatory \"contract\" to repeated 3rd density incamations, there's proportionately less correspondence of exclusive affinityhdentity with those higher density contexts in themselves. Owing to the commitment of their initiatory \"pledge\", such higher density beings routinely incamahg in 3rd density develop the useful viewpoint of a \"dual empathy\" in keeping with conciliatory requirements of their given Office. This \"dual empathy\" is more or less pro- nounced, more or less balanced between high and low densities as a teaching function according to which Office it is they represent. The Offices of which we speak are three in number. Those familiar with the \"theosophi- cal\" material of Alice Bailey will recognize the recitation of Offices, and, for what it's worth, may note MT concurs on the validity of those Posts as cited therein. The first Office is the cosmic Crown of the Many an universal-avataric function correlated with the Ray of Will. The second Office is that of the Bodhisattva (definitionally exemplified by Jesus and Buddha, historically) correlated with the Ray of LovWisdom. The third Office is that of Mahachohmr, correlated with the Ray of Ceremonial Magick (i.e. the Ray of Intelligent Activity), associazed with the Akashic diiension-of-being and the Principal of Mother. \"Mother\" has, historically, remained unembodied in terms of an avataric representation until now, so that the Office bas (again, historically) been filled exclusively by a male ambassador to the Post. Mahachohmt remains to this day the designation of the mde counterpart to the Ray of Intelligent Activity; \"Motheryy is proper title for the female embodiment of that Rayad only that female embodiment technically qualifies for the designation, since she alone fulfills a specific mind/body function with respect to requirements of the Office. The latter Office is indeed the most deeply 'kmestrialized\" of the Offices; its sacred representatives or Incarnations take embodiment morefilly than the representatives of the other two. Thus one may expect that the quotient of \"shared empathy\" between higher and lower densities is greatest of all in the Persons of the Mahgchohan and the Mother, and that the fidfillment of their particular Offices has very much to do with this quality of shared empathy. (More on the three theosophical Offices in Excerpt-\"Introduction to the Mother Book\", this volume.) Although there are usually one or (at the most) two complete and authentic embodiments of each--or anydffice at any one time on the \"earth-plane\", all incarnations into 3rd density projected from the higher densities whether 4th 5th or 6th take place under the auspice of one of"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"MATRIX N those three Rays. For example, though the Mahachohan and the Mother are embodied at this time thus completelyfilling the Wce, numbers of other beings from 4th, 5th and 6th density presently take embodiment under implicit aegis of their Office and therefore serve, with or without awakened knowledge as such (in any given case) in the form offinctionaries on behalf of the Ray of Intelligent Activity. They are, as it were, \"Mother's little helpers\". Thus from 4th 5th and 6th densities do indeed come (in hierarchic order) authentic teachers, adepts, masters and avatars pertaining variously to the Offices of Mam, Bodhima and Mahachohan. The Mahachohan is, for example, Master of the adepts for the Ray of Intelligent Activity, or the Ceremonial Magick Ray (see Treatise on Cosmic Fire, A. Bailey). It is given that the Bodhisattva (LovetWisdom) ''learns\" fiom the Manu (Will), and the MahachohanlMother (Intelligent Activity) \"learns\" hm the Bodhisattva Thus their respective Offices tend to manifest historically in an overlapping succession of phases minoring this hierarchy. Each brings the Change initiated by the Manu at that time, deeper and with progressive indelibility into the \"physical\" sphere, toward eventually emting a wholesale 4th density transition of that sphere. The aforementioned Meher Baba of Puna, India, fulfilled the modem Office of Manu for the present aeonic transition. This is an \"assertion\" which, nonetheless, we shall demonstrate in the body of our text (e.g. Motro-in-the-Lotto) to a degree sufIiciently suggestive for those prepared to identify the characteristic marks and signanues. In fulfiUment of that Office, he prepared the Way for the complementary modem embodiments of the Bodhisattva function; Baba died in 1969, and those contemporary Heart-functionaries began almost immediately theteafter, in the early '70s, to perform their teaching work. One such functionary was murdered; the other is at the present time decommissioned-but neither eventuaiity transpired until sufficient ground was prepared for advent of the final functionaries of the Triune Spiritual Offices, the Mahachohan and the (first time, awakened) embodiment of the Mother. Events relative to the respective outcomes of the Bodhisattva emissaries were concluded by the end of the 1980s; activation of the Office of Mahachohan, the Ray of Ceremonial Magick (or Intelligent Activity) and advent of the planetary Mother occd in overlap at approximately the same time (late '~OS, early '90s). Why The Crown Of False Knowledge Always Dreads This Word Do you dread this word? Do you hate to hear it, and had hoped to hear another?

The depth of youi aversion may therefore be taken as a fairy accurate measure of the extent to which you've been \"programed\" (or deprogramed, as the case may be) to accept everything but the intimate truth of what's really been going on all along. Ask yourself why this gentle information ought to bother you so tembly ...Why is it so much easier to accept the idea that help and knowledge and love and salvation are somehow coming hm \"elsewhere\", fiom a safely (?) removed dimension?

Who gave you this compulsive orientation40 you know? Yes, we can find within that \"motivation7' toward arbitrary, autonomous self-authority both honorable and dishonorable components, both ktoors justified by the psychological facts of existence and not-so justified. One has a justifiable wish not to be exploited in the real vulnerability and contingency of one's \"not knowing\" (a chronic condition of not-knowing that, regardless every learned assertion of certitude, swamps fbm all bewildering sides of existence with the inexorability of sleep). One has an earnest desire that this wonisome state of existential ignmce clinging despite every daylight denial, not sene as treacherous occasion for the displacement of one's potential power in trust of \"another\", pretending to have one's best interests at heart and a superior grasp of the secrets of life while sumptitiously claiming &an!age through just such trusting submission. To the end of seaming these j-le concerns, however, the soul seals itself in the premature hermeticism of the \"culturaUy approved\", fbst impressed as psychic Monitor in introjection of the parental superego (a remis aufieud) and personified thereafter by social authority of every kind. One either emulates the sovereignty of that authority in identification with its peremptory stature, or submits to it uncritically for the implicit approbation it awards. In either case, one has fatally swapped one's personal plague of ignorance for a crown of False Knowledge. One submits at an early age (therefore an age very vdnerable in in even of simple mechanical forms of \"not howing\") to the cult of edhaation; and, feeling the internal betrayal ever after in refractory persistence of that nervolcs contingency before E's imponderables, one learns to protest all the louder against anything which curls into a questionmark so as to lay the wound of doubt in the well-armored side. Thus in a very real sense \"you\" are your government before ever the government gets its ind omhating hooks more deeply embedded; for one always invites that reactive conditioning by one's enculturated readiness to accept all thepseudo-answers of society-y society, actually.

Welcome back to the cult of the norm. That is how things are done here, traditionally. Socrates was forced to drink the hemlock, for much less than is presented in this book. It should be only selfevident to any reader fhdmg this volume in his hands, that the conventional \"criteria\" for avoiding your hypnotic takeover and brainwashing covers everything whatsoever and therefore covers nothing. Those \"criteria\" for \"determining a cult\" are just a way of enforcing the cultural norm, suitable to personality types that are grossly aaaclitic already. While \"keeping vigilance\" against any teaching that potentially \"alienates you from your family's values\" may certainly \"save you\" from some sinister mountebank with a copy of \"Hypnosis-Made-Easy\" in his back pocket and a basii eye on your bankbook, it also eflciently insulates you against any real teacher or teaching of a higher stage than your straitjacketed 3rd!

But what hguishes, rots; the False Crown of cultural \"knowledge\" (not any particular \"piece\" of objective knowledge but simply the uncritical certitude that \"I already know\", whether \"religious\" or \"secular\" in content) is nwer enough in any case, since the unacknowledged gangrene-of-the-soul that inevitably sets in demands something more, from an intrinsic dimension of one's own greater being. Society has to \"save you\" from fake and true teachers. Indeed it will only \"save you\" from those false teachers that threaten the innate falsity of its Teaching. It won't save you from its kind of false teacher. And it will certainly never equip you with the means of identifying the true.

What need"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"MATRIX N of \"another\" altogether, when it comes to this particular topic of Knowledge? since, unlike the higher calculus, the Questions of Existence are rooted in our own innate Being? Well ... how have you done so far? (don't tell MT...tell yourself; that's the only chance of your being honest with yourself). Have \"Bashar?' or the \"Pleiadeans\" really given you anything more than an ego-rush at the enforcement of \"inner knowings\" as to your solipsistic command of the cosmos? Where are you left when the peptalk enthusiasm dies down? The nature of this \"reality\" is a little more refi-actory than that. Yes, Truth ultimately comes in the godbeing of your own innate Self; but before that, It comes in the form of \"other ': and necessarily so. This is the Way your cosmic and spiritual education is Logoically given; you implicitly strain forward out of the \"sovereignty\" of your inner self, to catch the assurances of \"others\" such as Krishnamurthi or Ramtha as to the validity of that sovereignty. Why? That very motion (no matter how minute) to check and confirm, betrays a lack of confidence. And rightly so. For it is chronically the lower case \"self ', the standardized ego-self (by the conventions of identity) which seeks Man of its self-insular sovereignty, the assurance of its imperious autonomy as a \"reality creator\", as \"captain of its soul\" etc. Yet it's precisely that \"lower case\" or ego-self which exists by virtue of the Crown of False Knowledge. It is not that Soul which \"already knows\", but the fatuous function of the enculhaated norm which \"already knows\" as a general way of insulating itself hm the larger intuition of the soul. It is the illusionary sovereign of an insular self-nclosure, which, far fiom commanding automatic knowledge of the Greater Reality, seals itselfofand locks itself away hm the greater Reality precisely in proportion as it touts uncritical acceptance in \"knowledge\" of its haginmy-subject identity. Tmth first comes in the form of \"Other\" because this ego-self is not \"already awake\", not already alive to its greater reality. It's closed to the greater reality, which necessarily then appears as an \"otherness\" to it. Indeed its tendency is to insulate itselfhm exactly the inexorable \"erosion\" of this \"Otherness\", or the Greater Reality. Truth mtllrt first come in the form of Other, for it's precisely this \"other\"--otherwise complementing and \"completing\" the partiality of the ego-sub- ject-which the ego-self infinitelyfems and resias at the same time it seeks self-ratification j-om thefieId of other (since it feels the chronic incompletion of its own subjective \"sovereignty\"). Only \"Other\" can take the ego-subject out of or Beyond itself, as a requirement of its aligning with and locking into the Total Being constituting the true ground of its Intuitive Unity. Thus you must always take the teachingfunction of your Awakening first hm \"an- other\". Despite the glib Krishnamurthi-ization of this century's lazier \"seekers\", the state of your \"innate Knowing\" starts out crippled by a real malalignment of your mind/body coordinates (through which the totality is functionally focused and processed), based on the encoiled cultural norm of the ego-selfthat \"already knows\".

This, however, is already too much as far as the culture and its governmental instnunent are ever concerned-for they're forever jealous of ''their own\" (insistent-but-vulnerable) self-sov- ereignty, and therefore peremptorily claim a monopoly on your love. That's all that's ever really gone on here. That's the whole story of this dimension--and you haven't even got past the Introduction! Then who are the real teachers, adepts and masters? Teachers, adepts and masters have collaborated in the composition of this book. Actually, you've known them for some time but didn't know you knew them. Then what's a teacher? wh's an adept? what's a master? The Teacher First of all, a teacher in the strict sense (remember: to MT these are formal not casual categories) is one whose cumulative developmental background over the incarnate arc roughly corresponds already to a minimum em& 4th density. He's already bowled a passing he, so to and is back here in the 3rd basically to \"pick up the spare\". Such teachers generally incamate, whether \"aware\" of it or not, in supplemental accompaniment of the work of adepts and masters. Theirs is not so much a secondmy function in that sense, as a work of primary importance in itself whereby the fht@& spirit (seeded by the contemporary \"squadron\" of adepts, avatars etc.) is nourished and extravagantly expanded, in real works that enter into and profoundly affect the cultures-of-the-world at large. Such beings are \"teachers\" not in the sense of pedants or-neces- sarily--as formal hstmctors but in the sense of great lovers, whose uncommon adroitness in the art of caressing and bringin% Lie to little climaxes of inspiration serves in the long nm to accelerate the general perception They teach as a spontaneous function of their gargantuan creativity then; they naturally lead the lights of intelligence moving down the darkened corridors of 3rd density on behalf of the whole, as expression of their superior magnetic coherence gently but persuasively entraining the \"leading edge\" of that remaining mass which is at all self-moved toward higher states of creative integrity. They may be ''recognized\" in their day or they not; they may be acknowledged by their peers or they may suffer neglect in their lifetimes. Yet their influence is inexorable over the longer haul, so far ahead in many cases that it simply takes the grinding passage of time beyond their own little lifespans to fill-in a sufficient number of cultural blanks for others to catch up. It's not that such real teachers don't also lem; they are, on the contrary, constantly leanring, and they learn-know it or not'hrough cultivated psychic antennae ammed to the basic spiritual numen being first of all focused through the translucent lens of adept-perception. They may not-qdly do not--have fond connection to or knowledge of the spiritual masters and adepts contemporaneously seeded around the globe at any given time with them; such teachers, owing to the blindering darkness of the 3rd density condition, might consciously belittle the very idea of \"spiritual adepts\" etc. Yet they'refimctiowies of those adepts and masters whether or not they know it, pledged by pre-incarnative agreement to further the fertilizing Spirit of the Time brought forward in direddownpouring abundance by those masters. Therefore the true teacher (in this strict/foxmal sense) is constantly learning basically as a means of employing the quickening catalyst of 3rddensity condition in acceleration of his ongoing density-correspondence at the soul level. A teacher technically corresponding to early 4th density"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"MATRIX N (upon first taking the particular life of 3rd density incamation as which he becomes subsequently known) may at the completion of that corporeal span have so magnified the integral sum of accessible qualities as further \"opening of the lotus petals of the heart\" that he's effectually matriculated, and passes after exhaustion of bodily life to a higher 4th density demesne. Such a teacher \"learns\" just like everyone then, but in an uncommon way, a way fi-ankly beyond the available potential of the mass-conscious mind correlated strictly to 3rd density. Such a teacher has an omnivorous appetite for learning; his learning is an awesome spectacle to the rest His heroic \"learning\" is the colossal feast of some Pmtagmel, and the materials of that feast are always being passed and processed through a mighty ~Q~ within his being, alchemically transmuted in the full-tilt alembic of his soul so that what is \"learned\" flows b out the athunor as lambent Vision, dazzling to the rest and setting the Learning Standard for the time and times to come. Amongst those we may legitimately cite as teachers are, in this century, lights such as Tesla, Einstein, Picasso, Dali, Joyce, Stravinsky, Freud, Jung, Reich, Rife, Isha and H. A. Schwaller de Lubicz and Jack Kerouac. (These are named because well known4ey hardly exhaust the list) The Adept Adepts are those whose cumulative backgrouud by incarnation has fitted them to a (technical) mid4th density correspondence or higher, some even pressing experientially upon the 5th. An adept is one developed to a sufficient degree of rnind/body integration as to have minimum command upon certain \"inner\" or esoteric powers; according to the tradition in which he develops or expresses, such non-ordinary faculty may be a manifestation of one or a number of chaRras in combination, and may take the characteristic form of facility with ''astral travel\", spirit summoning, manifestation of \"siddhi\" (\"supernod\" power of the type demonstrated by snowmelting monk or levitating acolyte, the qi phenomena of the martial arts adept) etc. The adept has developed dlicient control of certain vehicles or combinations of vehicles, centers or a synthesis of centers as to be able to invoke the non-ordinary state at will. He's thus enabled to make use of powers, faculties, energies, \"inner\" subtle organs and magnetic lifefields unknown or technically unavail- able to others. Just as the \"teacher\" of our first definition brings a real creative power forward which influences the operative-3rd4ensity either directly (by its persuasion of minds) or more subtly (through quickening of the \"biomorphic field\" with superior ideoform coherence), the adept serves as a kind of intensifying \"node\" in the network of subtle energies mdergirdin% the globe; in giving . . expression to one or more types of such subtle force (through c-c exercise of control over same) he acts as a kind of nonlinear convergence-locus through which amplified energies issue, consequently influencing overall acceleration of the plane. The implicit intensity of his integral presence may be compared to a gravitational field, which conformally bends and thereby accelerates whatever is drawn under its influence. Owing to his capacity or his training for tapping the field of such subtle power, the adept generally has a minimal grasp of many of theprinciples involved in the enlarged framework. Though he may be thus familiar with those immediate principles involved in the given art (e.g. astral traveling), or may be more generally familiar with principles of the overall infrasrmcam, his adeptship is located in the specific control he exercises with respect to certain subtle functions or faculties. The hallmark of the adept is his practical expertise in generating the particular power or"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"MATRIX N rousing the particular force (or set of forces) with which he's identified. He's marked by the ability to draw on the non-ordinary at will. The Master Master is the designation for one whose cumulative background, incamationally or otherwise, has fitted him to a minimum 5th density correspondence. Many \"criteria\" have been given for the qualification--or identification--of a Master, it has been stipulated through one tradition or another that a \"master\" must be he who's completed a certain minimum curriculum, performed or passed through certain formal threshold rites, who has met the requirements of \"knowledge\" in the ladder of lower grades etc. Yet the characteristic of the Master has no such outward measure or objective guarantor at all. A Master is one whose value of mind/body integration and quotient of stable coherence is minimally such as to establish him in a constancy of non-ordinary being. He is one enjoying minterrapzed contimi@ in integral congruence with the Ground of Being, to greater or lesser degree. This is the minimal requisite for \"Master\"401 a Master is, constitu- tionally, one Who's \"crossed the abyss\" dividing the \"slumbering\" states of consciousness hm the Awakened state of consciousness. The master is one who enjoys indelible Identity with, through, in and as spiritized Void-being, to greater or lesser intensity of all-consuming Equivalency. He is one whose every thought, feeling, mood, emotion and behavior is tacitly refefenced toward Void-being, curtomatically oriented with respect to Void-being, discharges as celebratory expression or intended symbol-form of Void-being, and is constitutionally ordered as the distribu- tive largege of Void-being. He is, as the traditions say, dyed fast in the color of Reality. His \"practice\" is ecstatic intensification in the alignment of that Presence, through a kind of unhesitating devotional willingness that can only come from living the Reality of that Presence rather than merely anticipating it. This di&q@hes the Master hm the adept, as a state of Being. Whereas the adept may produce or invoke or attain to qualities of void-beii may cut various \"angles\" into void-being at will by virtue of his subtle knowledge regarding the fulcra of control, the Master is established in Void-being. Being thus gyroscopically related to and balanced in the ground of Reality, the Master uniquely uses that condition itself as the skeleton key to Existence. His steady-state Presence in-and-as Void-being allows him automatically to tum the tumblers on the various locks guarding the Principles of Lie. Whereas the adept, by virtue of his practical knowledge of subtle states and energies inhering in void-being Ground may be acquainted with certain occult principles or non-ordinary laws, the Master is a Master of the Principles of Creative Existence altogether. Thus the Master may or mqy nor exhibit subtle powers, extraordinary agencies, command the visible allegiance of colossal allies or elementals ... the Master is not descriptively distinguished or identified by any such phenomenal proofs or presentations. According to the specific -on served by the given master, he mqy display a Siddhi or supernoxmal spiritual power-but in such case he does so toward distinctly different purpose than that of the adept; he does so as a Teaching demonstration of First Principles; he does so as a Master of the Laws of Life, and may make those laws known toward the general edification and raising of consciousness. He may produce effect and phenomena by his Word, but in such case he does so not according to the requirements of the devas, elementals or subtle intelligences involved in conducting the effect (as does the adept), but on the contrary as an Inshuction and Education to those servitor powers themselves as well as to the run of adepti--whose level, state, grade and orientation are such as to require the (periodic) gyroscopic"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV influence and rebalancing guidance Intelligently directed hm the Ground of Being (see Motto-in- the-lotto, as well as section on Liber A1 in MT's The Mother Book). This is owing to the fact that the adept's practical relation to void-being is tunnel-like. The adept moves back and forth through Void-being obliquely as it were, oriented through the trajectory of linear purpose or target accomplishment. The adept moves toward climax or denoue- ment, which (ideally) would be definitive Resolution with the Ground of Being. He looks upon that Resolution as abiding in actual planes, states, fields or adjacent universes asymptotically just \"beyond\" the limit of his current expertise in opening the ch4kradoors of the dimensions. Thus he \"passes through\" the corridors of Void-being, and those void-corridors \"pass around\" him, as he Captain-Kirks some beamship or lightbody toward beckoning galaxy clusters and glowing chakra- constellations of his own higher Denouement. Thus there may be both \"adepts\" and authentic \"spiritual masters\" in any of the traditions, occupying seats in any of the esoteric disciplines. The \"kuudalini-adept\" (often wrongly called Master) may raise or lower the Sakti to the Crodsahasrara at Will, moving up and down in awareness like a thermometer. The Master of yoga is the living expression of the Sahasrara, and shines its light steadily through all he says, does and is. The zen adept has learned to coax the subtle glimpse of satori at will. The Zen Master is the Presence through which any such satori is given at all. Third stage (i.e. density) consciousness is always seeking some means of measuring, some sure method or yardstick for evaluating the authentic presence of \"adept\" or \"master\", as if there was a check-sheet somewhere against which the required traits could be marked off. Third stage consciousness, characteristically, wants \"objective assurances\"--and since Reality expresses in part by objective means, it isn't unreasonable that 3rd density should be given its objective criteria to the limit of that mode (see A Modest Proposal). Thus MT immediately modifies the conventional wisdom of many traditions that strenuously insist upon the strict inexistence of such objective measurement (thereby generating a gnashing of teeth among many); at the same time however, the qualiig phrase should be noted: \"to the limit of that mode\". The fact of the matter is, teachers, adepts and especially spiritual Masters may manifest any way they will. The only we mode of detection in any given case lies in the requirement for sober cultivation of a higher intuitive faculty in the mind making the Inquiry, of course, this visits a certain obligation upon 3rd stage consciousness, converting its demand into a mandare with somewhat arduous implications! Yet that's how it works, and how it's supposed to work. Especially in the case of the Master (of whatever degree, density grade or corresponding function) there's nothing left in tenns of concept or cognition, belief or \"orientation\" to qualifjl his expression at all, or somehow limit it before the fact The Spiritual Master, owing to the critical magnitude of Awakening he necessarily represents, always serves a kind of cosmic or spiritual firnction; such Awakening never really takes place as an abstract incident. It Echoes down all the halls of Infinity, gathers the impressions of every faculty and is given as an Offering to the Whole. As such an offering, it invites to serve and fulfill some function appearing by requirement of that Whole. Yet the Master isn't restricted by that function. It is his Creative Means. The Master above all others, above evewhing, has no fixed mode whereby to appear and therefore by which he may easily be \"identified\"."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"MATRIX N The desire for such easy identification is just a trait of slumbering 3rd density conscious- ness in any case. Though the Realization of the authentic Masters is necessarily Identical in nature, to a far deeper degree even than for the host of adepti, confusion comes for 3rd stage consciousness- scouting for petty \"consistencies\"-precisely in the existential uniqueness and immediacy of the Master Presence. That Presence represents not only the Heart of Void but the Summit of lndividu- ation. Void-being, after all, has assumed the master-personality heartlmindland soul, so that there's @so facto no concept, belief, expectation, prejudice or passion that takes precedence for that Consciousness over Void-beii Itself. And Void-being isfiee--free even or especial& in context of the particular Function it incarnates in Service to the Whole. The Master Presence therefore always tricks the expectation. Where the \"last\" identified h!laster apparently set a precedent so that we might know the next, the next when he comes along inevitably confounds the expectation, and altogether belies the whole notion of consistent external traits or identifiable signs. His Mastership is, inevitably, discovered \"anew\" (or no) by his contemporaries as a hction of his uniqueness, precisely as expression of the wholly unprecedented character of his Advent. As Master of the very Principles of existence, he's obliged by no local \"law\", rule of thumb or indigenous roadmap. Thus while the mass of presentdaykd stage consciousness awaits the \"exteriorization of the hierarchy\", the millennia1 \"return of the Masters\" and \"immanenthion of the eschaton\", the Masters slip in to no particular no tice... indeed are greeted, if at all, with rude dimids for not appearing per expez%tion, and by theosophical hallmonitors admonishing them to move along so as not to block the view of all those incoming angels! (This is literally the case: W has recently related to MT the incident of a self-styled \"adeptus\" who by mail solemnly counseled how they both should stay especially alert now since:,ferentially, by \"insider tip\" exclusive to such cognoscenti as himself4ven greater and greater Masters of the Hierarchy were due to descend and \"reveal themselves any &\"...He added as a little fillip how W could make use in Leading Edge of certain of his \"Order's\" materials if he wished, but \"please don't identify\" him or his order in any way! no doubt since he didn't want the purity of his own heavenly connection sullied by 8ssociation. ..) Of course we may recognize in all this the usual, dull-as-lead 3rd-stage ploy for preserving its own--imagined-vereignty and maintaining its de facto spiritual leadership in absentia of the \"real thing\" by chronically deflecting attention toward the inexistentfirmre tense, where Hope may spring etemal with the gratifying certainty it will never be fblfilled. But the adepts are unobliged, and the Masters absolutebfiee to do as they Will. They manifest as they may, and give Sign of their Presence that inevitably evades the eye of conventional expectation so that such eye may remain 'neath shuttered lid, undisturbed in its clearly preferred slumberland (where 3rd stage dream still dictates the terms). What use for \"even more\" masters to come, when the ones who are here remain largely unnoticed, mistaken for something less, are overlooked or even, outright abused? The \"Hierar- chy\"--or whatever part of it had planned to come--is already here. Surprised? Then look some more--not through the eye that calculates but through the heart that feels. The real Masters give their unique \"evidences\" in connective expression fkom heart to heart, fht of all, so that the means to recognize may first be awakened within; in this way those with the imperious \"criteria\", the"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"preformed-itemized demands and expectations may never know them--which is all to the good. Thus one spiritual master may come for all those destined to be with him (or Her, to be sure!) by way of stirring some restless desire for Mexican cuisine, only so that the prospective devotees may come to locate him as proprietor of a taco stand!

Then see for yourself who really retrans on behalf of the Whole. The Avatar In order to understand what an matar is, it's first necessary to understand the much discussed matter of correlation between \"densities\" and \"stages\" of spiritual development. For a definition of \"densities\", see \"MT Dictionary\" this volume; &ce here to say that \"density\" in metaphysical terms doesn't correspond to conventional definitions of inertia, viscosity, opacity etc. Indeed \"density\" in the metaphysical sense conelates positively to degree of perceptual or cognitive subtle& it refers to the quotient of fonnal limitation integrated through coordinates of the (variable) cognitive grid-network, detegmining the mailable intensity of total energy-infodon coded for a given volume (see also Channeling, UFOs etc., subheading \"I Am Your Density\"). \"Third density\" (the one you're presently experiencing) tends to tell us things are fixed and solid; 4th density allows us to perceive such \"solidity\" as an energetic kind of fluidflraleido- scopic \"coagulation\"; 5th density allows us to behold all things whether apparently \"solid\" or not, as coordinative fields of geometrized light networks; 6th tends toward direct knowledge of such light-composites as self-luminous idea etc. and therefore as-themselves-ideoform patterns of the permissive cognitive grid-network. Each such density level carries as its chief importance a reigning quotient of allowable insight or intuition with respect to reality as a whole; this quotient correlates with the compositional quality cited above. The stages of spiritual development are given in the context of 3rd density embodiment, each successive stage above 3rd (ordinary mind) corresponding to its numerically parallel density. This means that authentic initiation to the higher stages, in 3rd density context, succeeds at each step in realigning the focused mindhdy coordinates of the subject so as to allow into the (formerly-screened) 3rd density fhmework the class of insightfintuition indicative of the numerically parallel density. Depending on the type, class or \"school\" of initiation these coordina- tive realignments may relink the respective densities in such a way as to permit direct perception- interaction as with \"subtle\" faculties, and/or direct insight-knowledge participating in the available"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV essence of the opened density. This correlation between stage and density holds until we get to the question of a 7th stage of Initiatic awakening, and the corresponding 7th density. While there are authentic masters of a 7th stage awakening, these are extremely rare (fir more so than schools and traditions perennially claim) and may properly be considered avatars. Moreover, these 7th stage Initiates do not correspond in themselves to 7th density, and this is where the otherwise perfect correlation of stages and densities \"breaks down\". The reason for this, is that 7th density does not properly \"incamate9'a persodity-ex- pression or divine \"representative\" hm its own level, since 7th density isn't so much a successive step in the octaval hierarchy--and thus \"higher\" and \"removed\"-as it is the immanence of Logoic DENSITY I INFAZRY Divinity within everything.

This, then, is thefirst piece of verboten information brought to you courtesy of Matrix N; for the knowledge of the truth regarding teachers, adepts, masters and avatars is far more subversive than spilled information regarding \"secret government pacts with spacealiens\", the longtime furtive use of alternative energies by the phantom power structure or even the existence of such powerstructure itself. Indeed, we may here submit that unexpected tolerance for the continued existence of such publicly-indispensable media as the earlier Matrix volumes and Leading Edge etc. might well be attributable to the inevitable shift in attention toward that power structure which the \"freeing\" of our information has caused.

Many times, the journey through ones own evolution in consciousness seems a very lonely one - wen one that seems separate from everything else - separation from the Unity inherent in the Universe and the basic undershnding of how things relate to each other mathematically, vibrationally and otherwise. A lot of people around me seemed to be separate from themselves and everyone around them in their journey.

As mentioned before, the paradigm of Matrix IV was created in order to attempt to fdl this need, and a lot of conceptual planning went into it The FOL paradigm was immediately recogaized to be a part of the overall paradigm of Matrix IV.

In the paradigm, Drunvalo reviews the whole science of sacred geanetry as it relates to creation, manifestation of dimensional reality systems and life itself. An innmetable number of people have benefited from the seminar, where Drunvalo teaches about the geanetry of the fields that surround the hunan body and haw to move those fields to create a light-based rotational field called the Clerkaba (also spelled Uerkabah). The term Wrkaba is also found in many other texts around the world, including Hurtak's Keys of Enoch; it is not presented in Drunvalo's seminars as a belief system, but as a potential way of utilizing emotion and love as a means to ascension, which is defined as moving through dimensional changes while still occupying the body, as opposed to the concept of resurrection, which is going through the process of physical death and re-ernergence on another dimensional level. Drunvalo addresses the changes that have occurred within levels of conscious development during man's history, the involvement of off-world species in the developnent (and fall) of the human condition, and many more subject areas that are of keen interest in the turbulent society of the 1990's. The question of what is going on within other unseen levels and the final disposition of the human species is addressed in a way that provides a paradign of thought within which to consider what is happening all around us. The science and practice of using light fields based on enation and love is taught on a semi-regular basis by Drunvalo in seminars around the United States, and a contact number is provided within the text if you wish to consult the schedule for his seminars. No attempt is made in this transcription to teach the exercises relative to the employment of the light fields , as the techniques are best learned through your om experience, coupled with proper instructional methodology available only fran the source. The geanetry of fom has proven to be an accurate measure of the workings of everything in the universe; the mathematical aspects of primary fom and the resultant interrelationship with consciousness, dimensionality, frequency and wavelength consitute what is known as 'Sacred Geometry'. Within the context of the discourse, the instructional material in Sacred Geornetry is priceless, and has never been presented in this way before."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Breathing Proper breathing is essential to the process of manifestation of the field, as it adds the energy of Prana/Chi to the process. This type of energy is also closely connected to 'spirit\", and contributes toward the maintenance of the life force in organic organisms. Breathing procedures that accumulate vital energy into the human energy systems are important. Physiological transmutation of toxic substances is also proportional to the level of vital energy existing. Research seems to indicate that the hman did not always breathe in the same way as we do today, that either humans or a protohuman precursor took in vital energy through the top of the head, and conducted it downward through the pineal gland to nourish the rest of the body. The \"male/electrical' aspect of pram was taken in through the head and the \"female/magnetic' aspect was taken in through the base of the spine, and the aspects met in one of the chakra areas. About 13,000 years ago, hmns started absorbing the vital force in the air that was breathed, instead of taking it in through the other systems. This change could be said to be analogous to the 'bib1 ical fall of man', and was no doubt a forced change that was made to human physiology to keep humans enslaved into the body-oriented system; it contributes to a state of polarity-conscious- ness in hunans, where things are seen in tenus of \"good' and 'bad'; this fact is taken advantage of during the continuing process of enculturation in hman society. This effectively blinds most humans to the perception of the conscious- ness of the Creator with everything and everyone. Brain states and resulting social manifestations of consciousness are detailed in Matrix 111. The progression of events in the evolving hmm is that dualities are perceived, dualities are then seen in everything, and then the unity of everything is perceived, essentially disrupting the initial dualism. There is a recognition that there is a deep aspect of consciousness in life. In body consciousness, there is the impression that 'are the body'. Later, conscious- ness expands and we 'live inside this body\" and 'everything out there is separate f ram us', and our thoughts and feelings 'have nothing to do with what is going on out therem. Still later, one realizes that everything you think, feel and do contributes to what manifests itself 'out therem. You are creating everything - mre so than you can imagine, Humans are generally in a state of transition. We are about to drop this line of consciwsness and adopt a way of being that is really different fran the one we are used to, Much of what will initially be discussed in the following material is done so within the context of historical events, and within that context, the concepts of and relationships with sacred geometry will be brought forth,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Mathematical Sequences In order for us to understand what's going on here in 1993 or what will happen in the near future, we must understand the nature of what has happened in the past. We have to understand what happened before, combined with what is happening now, to understand what will happen in the apparent future. To start, let's briefly discuss the concept of mathematical sequences. Plant growth uses the Fibronacci sequence (1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55 ... 1. A plant will grow one leaf, and then it will grow one more, but in order to do that it simply adds what it just grew to where it is now to determine what to grow next. That's organic structure. Most of use are familiar with the idea of a mathematical sequence, such as l,2,3,4,5,6 ... or 2,4,6,8,16,32 ... It requires only three numbers of a series to figure out what series it belongs in (other than the logarithmic series, the mother-father of all other series). Analogous to this, the human mind has not only duality consciousness - it is canposed of three aspects. A11 apparent dualities have in reality three aspects, ie, past-present-future, mother-father -child, macrocosm-where you aremicrocosm. Concepts of History Our present day concept of history is that civilized societies began in Sumeria about 3900 BC and before that there were nothing but hairy barbarians, and that we are the end product, somehow, and that we are the greatest thing that every hit the planet. In truth, there have been civilizations on the Earth that were so far in advance of 1992, that we cannot even imagine where they were at, going back 500 million years on the Earth. The Hefferlin Manuscript, released by Borderland Sciences Research Foundation, gives an example of one of those civilizations fm that time period that was situated at what is now the South Pole. Other examples abound through history. The Earth, in a sense, is a 'star-seed', where lifefonns have come together and produced new offspring, which have gone through stages of development and have left the planet. Humans on Earth are now in one of those stages of develop- ment. The Sirius Mystery and the Dogons Robert Temple's book 'The Sirius Mystery' chronicles the research into the Dogon Tribe in Africa, who maintained and demonstrated knowledge of 'the star system of Sirius, both Sirius A and Sirius B (an invisible dwarf star); this was knowledge they must have been given by someone long ago, for they had no equipment with which to make that discovery on their own. The details of the Sirius Mystery reveal what may be a long-standing relationship with the Sirian system and Earth.

Dogon elders detailed the story of the coming of the Nam~, in ancient times to their land; the tribe has maintained this information for over 700 years. According to the elders the Narmo, a people from the stars who gave the tribe this infonna- tion, were a semi-aquatic species of life form that had a tail similar to that of a dolphin. According to the Dogon, Sirius (A), which is one of the brightest stars in the sky, has a small but heavy star going around it. Twenty years ago, astronaners discovered this star, Sirius B, a heavy white dwarf. The Dogons maintained that the small. heavy star rotated around the other one every 60 years - a fact later confirmed by scientists. The Dogons drew pictures of the Nomno, which Temple published in his book; these indicate that although the Ncmm were aquatic, they were air-breathing. The Dogons drew a picture of the orbital convolutions between the two stars for the period 1912 to 1990, and Temple later calculated the orbital paths - they matched. The only clear answer is that the Dogons were contacted by a species from the Si rian system. According to the legend of the Dogons, a ship descended down and landed on three legs. Beings aboard the craft hollowed out areas in the ground, filled them with water, and disembarked into the water themselves. The beings appeared to be a hybrid of a humanoid and a dolphin-1 ike form. They came to the shore of the water filled area and spoke to the Dogons, and gave them all this data. The beings were one of several groups of Nomno; sane of them remaining on a larger craft which hovered in the atmosphere. Some of the Nanmo, according to those who spoke to them, would be called 'the disruputers', and.one of them would 'die on the cross'. How this primitive tribe initially interpreted this data remains to be known, but the legends survive, complete with verifiable data. The Dogons also knew about all of the planets of the solar system a11 the way out to Pluto, as we1 1 as moons that have only just been verified. For an apparently 'primitive' tribe to know all this data would be impossible unless their story is true. The Dogon Drawing of the Nomno For some reason, the number 23 was important to the Dogons. The number 23 was also important to the Egyptians and the Babylonians, because on July 23rd"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Sirius rises above the horizon; it comes up about one minute before the Sun, which causes it to shine a brilliant ruby red during that minute. It was also when the star Sirius, the Earth and the Sun are in a straight 1 ine. Could this factor relate to the use of the two stars as star-gates between the two systesas? It is the beginning of the calendar for the New Year, according to many cultures. This is significant, because on the plain of Giza where the pyramids and sphinx are located, the eyes of the Sphinx line up with the exact period on the horizon where Sirius rises on July 23rd, and the pyramids are lined up to that point on the horizon. Sirius as a sun is also linked with Earth's sun in terms of a star-gate relationship, in which travel in higher wavelengths between the Earth and Sirian systems proceeds by entering one sun and exiting the other. Peruvian Legends of Creation Peruvian creation legends tell of a great disk that came out of the sky and landed on an island called the Island of the Sun (which is nou in Bolivia). During the Great Deluge, the top of this island was the first piece of land to emerge as the water receded. This same place, in fact, was where a group of Atlanteans, headed by Thoth, landed and began the Inca culture after the sink- ing of the last section of Atlantis. The Embedded Mathematics in Sanscrit There is evidence that the Sanscrit language has an interesting relationship to mathematics, and that the people who used the language knew a lot more about reality than orthodox historians might believe. There is quite a lot of Sanscrit poetry, and up until now that's all it appeared to be. However, one Sanscrit poem was analyzed in a certain way and it produced interesting results. A poem was taken out of Clarion Call magazine which, when converted into its English pronunciation, reads: GOPI BHAGYA MDHWRATA SRNGISO DADHI SANHIGA KHALA JIVITA KHATAVA GALA HALA RASWDHARA, translated as 'Oh Lord annointed with the yogurt of the milk- maids worship (Krishna), Oh savior of the fallen, Oh Master of Shiva, please protect me. ' An amusing enough poem, but researchers discovered that each sound had a nranerical value from 0 to 9, and when they applied the numerical order to the sounds in this poem, it was equal to Pi to 32 digits of accuracy. From this, it is gathered.that Sanscrit, like Hebrew, is a self-reflexive and self-referential language, in that they generate themselves fran any one of the caoponents, holw graphically. While the work of Stan Tennon shows that all the Hebrew letters can be generated fran shadowgraphs of one form, research of similar nature still re- mains to be done on Sanscrit. The prominent thought is that all the higher math- ematical thought of the culture was, for some reason, embedded in these poems."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Egyptian Sphinx Egyptologist John Anthony West, author of \"The Serpent in the Sky', once noted that the Sphinx looked a lot older.than everyone said it was. Present day archaeologists say it was created during the 4th Dynasty, around 3500 BC, by Cheops, who they also say created the great pyramids. Evidence indicates, how- ever, that it was Thoth who was ultimately responsible for their creation. It is mentioned in various translations of the Emerald Tablets that Thoth built the Sphinx, but those who have had contact with the entity who was Thoth have put this question to him, and evidently he has stated that the Sphinx is so old that he doesn't even know who built it - it is perhaps one of the oldest objects on the planet. Thoth claims the Sphinx is over 5.5 million years old. Recently, archaeologists have noticed the wear patterns on the Sphinx seem to indicate that water was involved in the wearing down of the back and side of the Sphinx, and that the water cut over two feet into the structure at one time. It was calculated that it would normally take 1000 years of torrential rain to wear it in that manner. It is a great controversy. Geology is caning into a headlong clash with archaeology. Since the Sahara desert is only about 9,000 years old, the Sphinx must be at least 10,000 years old. What this means is that it is going to break down all the concepts of who was on. this planet. Standard archaeological interpretations dictate that civi 1 izations began in Sumerian around 3800 BC, and there was nothing worth mentioning that happened before that. According to them, there wasn't anybody on the planet that could have created the Sphinx between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago. Edgar Cayce's work indicated that the Halls of Records are connected with the Sphinx and that it would be discovered someday and reveal wonderful discoveries to mankind. It is somewhat ironic that the current controversy is centered around that same ob- ject. The Sphinx contains proof, according to many sources, of the last 5.5 million years of evolution on the planet. Although there is evidence that sane civilizations (many of them advanced) existed as far back as 500 million years, something happened about 5.5 million years ago that seemed to relate to a dist- urbance in the Akashic memory of the planet. There seems to be a barrier at that point in time, as far as Thoth and others are concerned, to getting access to the older records. The Borderland Sciences Research Foundation once published a manuscript entitled 'The Hefferlin US', which described cities under the polar regions - Rainbow City was one of them. These cities were alleged to be over 500 million years old. The Ha1 1 of Records (others mention the Hall of Records even before Cayce did) were apparently to be discovered in 1990, according to Drunvalo Helche- zedik, a member of the Brotherhood of the Seven Rays. The items in the Hall of Records are not just physical objects - they exist on multiple levels of time and space. The Imnediate Nature of Hany Civilizations Despite archaeological belief systems, there is evidence that the Sumerian, Egyptian and other civilizations blossomed overnight into fully functioning societies. There are no indications that these societies \"evolved' into their"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV highest forms. Writing in Egypt, for instance, did not evolve into the highest form. It was there instantaneously and degenerated from there on, as did the civilization. What you will find in all the ancient civilizations, whether Hittite, Arkkadian, Egyptian, the Olmecs of South America, or any other one, is that they all started at the top and degenerated. It's like inventing the car and starting with a 1993 Porsche instead of the Model A. You will understand why civilizations started in this way when we get into discussing the precession of the equinox, later. The Sumerians, for example, have accurate depictions on their walls showing all the planets, all the way out to Pluto, in their exact proportionate size. A 'modem' archaeologist might ask, 'how could they know that? They couldn't see the planets with the naked eye'. The Surnerians also knew about the precession of the equinox, which we're going to talk about; it's about a 25,900 year cycle. They knew it in detail. It has been calculated that the only way you would know about the precession is through observation. The absolute minimum time that - would be required to observe the heavens and deduce the precession . is 2,160 years. So, how did they know that if, according to orthodox archaeologists, there was no one around 2,160 years before the Smrians? You can go on and on with this stuff. Thoth On the next page, you will see an Egyptian representation of Thoth; Thoth also has been known to be spelled Thoht. All evidence seems to indicate that the personality known as Thoth is a being that ascended long ago; he is one of many beings that wnsciously assunes a series of bodies during my periods of Earth development. He had a part to play in the Atlantean civilization, and at that time was km as Chiquitet Arlich Vanalites, who went through the resurrection process sane 52,000 years ago and, according to sane sources, remained in the same body until May 4, 1991, when he left. Chiquitet was his title; an English translation of the Atlantean nclme laeant 'seeker of wisdom'. Arlich Vanalites was his name during the period of Atlantis. Thoth, then, could be considered an 'ascended master'. Many people of this nature have left the Earth, and some continue to remain here. There is sanething that happens when you reach a certain stage of en1 ightenment, and that is that you realize that everything is connected, and that there is one Spirit moving through all life. Compassion sometimes takes over, and you decide not to leave and you stay as a teacher. The Ahnk symbol, when depicted hieroglyphically with an individual, means that the individual has reached a state of inraortality. So Thoth, among others, was seen as a 'god' to much of the population. Thoth's apparent vow was that he was going to remain on Earth until the planet reached a certain level of consciousness. We have reached that level, and we're over the hill. What happened during the war between the United States and Iraq reflected a part of that level, and we'll discuss more about that as we go on. The light is now stronger than the darkness, for the first time in about 16,000 years. It's a interesting phenomena. Remember when in the Christian Bible Jesus said not to resist 'evil'? The reason is because when you resist 'evil' in a polaric reality system, it means adding power to the. 'evil', and it gets much stronger. An example of this principle was when the' movie 'The Last Temptation of Christ' came out. Some Christians said 'we're not going 'to let that movie cane out!', and they resisted it using the media and other avenues of express- ion. This caused everyone to want to go see it, and it made millions."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Apparently, the power balance has shifted and the laws have now reversed themselves. When negativity tries to resist positives (which is its nature), it gives power to the positive side. Look at what happened in Russia. They decided to end the Comaunist party and were successful, because orthodox resistance to the effort to disband the party helped convince the population (and factors in the government) that it was a good idea. That's what is happening. You will keep seeing these polarity collisions and miraculous flip in the opposite direction, with people opening up more and more. Thoth's most famous \"act\" was that he introduced writing to the world. He is called the scribe in Egypt, because he wrote down all the history. The impact of writing on civilization exceeded the recent re-developnent of the atomic bomb. You will understand later, when we get to those levels of understanding, what the impact of writing really did and why it was necessary to introduce it. It was responsible for much subsequent physiological and genetic changes that took place in human civilization. Humans changed their height and the human mind became engrossed in polarity consciousness. The act was necessary in order to push evolution to the point where humans would eventually develop access to levels of Unity Consci wsness, or Christ Consciousness as some have cal led it."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Flower of Life The final product of Sacred Georaetry is seen above. It has been called the Flower of Life by sune cultures, but has been known by many names throughout history, and is known by cultures all over the universe. Sometimes it is called the 'language of light' or the 'language of silence'. It is the language that creates these very words. Everything that has ever been created is created by virtue of this pattern. Contained within it is everything - all the languages, all the laws of physics and biology - everything. This geanetric representation has been found all wer the planet on walls of most ancient civilizations, which proves beyond any doubt that these civi 1 i zat ions understood dimensional travel and a1 1 the laws of the universe, as you will see. The symbol is found on the walls at the temple of Abydos in Egypt, which is over 6,000 years old - the oldest temple in Egypt. Hieroglyphics extend fm the floor to the ceiling all wer the temple. Around 1984, it was realized that,..the hieroglyphics near the bottom of the wall reflected events before the temple was built. About eye level, events that took place during the time of construction are depicted. Above that, events in the future were inscribed in the stone. Depictions of future events appear to be very accurate, for near the top were depicted the weapons that were used in the US-Iraq war in 1990. The tanks and helicopters are clearly depicted on the wall, but cannot be seen too clearly on the reproduction of the photograph below:"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Osirian Temple There is a temple in Egypt that is called the Osirian Temple - it too is one of the oldest fn Egypt. The Osirion was discovered at Abydos in 1901 by Petrie, and excavations were complete by 1927. It is considered to be the empty tomb of Seti I, who ruled Egypt from 1312 to 1298 BC. The Osirion Temple was a temple of resurrection, and on its walls were found the Flower of Life symbols. The draw- ing below shows the layout of the temple as it originally stood. It is based on two back-to-back pentagons, and it is interesting that they used those forms; two back-to-back pentagons create what is known as an icosehedronal cap - it is also the basis for one of the geometric energy grids around the planet (which we will discuss later). It is that very same grid which is apparently enabling Unity Consciousness to manifest itself on the Earth. The grid has a feminine polarity. The Osirion is a large. underground Egyptian temple which is an architectural allegory depicting the pcocus of mnsformtion through death and rebirth as rcn- dcred in the myth of Osiris. The symboiism of Osiris k concerned with cyclic rebirth and transformation on both individual and univd levels. and the Osirion was designed to represent the tomb itself of Osiris.

The image below is camnonly associated with the early Christians, probably the Coptics. The Essenes cane out of Jerusalem but the Coptics came out of Egypt. As you will see, those groups were linked. As far as the temple was concerned, the Coptics were the ones who did the symbol, and the Egyptians came in later and were using the literal Flower of Life symbol in their teaching. If you go to Masada in Israel, to the oldest Essene church in the village, in the middle of the floor you will see the Flower of Life. The triangle with the cross in it was also connected with 'the Christ'. The same symbol was known Sumerian and Babylonian times, and referred to a specific race that was nentioned in the works of Sitchin. The Coptics existed about 500BC."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Another example below was also carved by the Coptics into the temple walls. The top portion of the symbol shows the six-petaled arrangement of the Flower of Life - it is the minirnm amount of infonnation that will describe the full draw- ing.

Today, it is used on its side, although for the first 200 years the symbol for 'the Christ' was the dol- phin, and he was called 'the dolphin' until the time when they transferred to the symbol of the fish. The fish was the symbol for 'the Christ\" even before anyone by that designation arrived."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Sacred Geanetri c Considerations Let's briefly discuss more concepts within Sacred Geometry. At one point, we will examine what is called The Great Void itself, ewe will examine how the Creation energy moves and forms in accordance with gecmnetric principles. The symbol of the Flower of Life was called that because that pattern symbolizes a tree which yields a flower, which yields a seed, which yields again a tree. So, the seed has the image within it of the tree; the flower must contain within itself the image of the seed. The aspect of the flower of life that is the Seed is the central circle, the six circles The figure compromising 'the seed' is the same figure found on the wall at Abydos in Egypt. It could be referred to as the 'seed of life'. Most of you are familiar with the diagram known as 'the tree of life'. It is often ass& that its origin was with the Cabalah and Hebrew tradition, but in truth it is mud more ancient than that. The Cabalah was released roughly l,?OO years ago. The 'tree of life' image has been found by Donald Beaman on three pillars, both in Karnak and Luxor, Egypt, that are a minimum of 4,000 years old.

A vesica piscis is formed when a circle is bisected with another circle of exactly the same size: - - Within the vesica piscis will fit two equilateral triangles, and the rect- angle that fits around that is called a Golden Mean Rectangle: This relationship is probably one of the best kept secrets in the universe; contained within a vesica piscis is all knowledge - this will becane clearer as the discourse proceeds. Very often in churches, the figure of Christ was dis- played inside of a vesica piscis. If you look at the Flower of Life and the Seed of Life, it is entirely made up of vesica piscis. All the lines connecting every point in the Tree of Life represents either the 1ength.or width of a vesica pis- ces. It is the nature of Sacred Geometry that there are no accidents. It is absolutely flawless, and continues to move in this way until 'the whole universe is created. You can start at any point within Sacred Geometry and generate the whole language. 35"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Egyptian Initiates and Dimensional Knowledge The figure above are examples of wheels that are found on sane cei 1 ings of the oldest temples in Egypt. Orthodox archeologists have no idea what they are, but research indicates that they are related to the harmonics of music and to the harmonics of the electromagnetic spectrum. They also relate to the concept of dimensional separation, which we will discuss further. They also constitute proof that the ancient Egyptians did nut inscribe the Flower of Life designs as an artistic expression, but really understood many facts in great detail. To get to these wheel designs, you had to have tremendous knowledge. The wheels are usually found in sets of four or sets of eight, because they relate to music, which we will see later. On one of the ceilings, above the wheels were depicted stars. Below the wheels are depicted all sorts of people with orange wals over their heads. The orange oval represents the 'egg of metamorphosis'; when you go through ascension or resurrection, you change shape. These beings are depected walking along the bottom of the wheels and then taking a 90 degree turn and moving up to where the stars are depicted above the wheels. As you will see, a 90 degree shift is a key factor in inter-dimensional consciousness changes. Many of you will remember data relative to the movement of sane UFOs, in that they move quickly through the sky and then make a 90 degree turn and disappear. That is what they were doing- making a dimensional shift- but they would do it in two increments of 45 degrees. All the dinensional levels are separated by 90 degrees. Dimensions and Wavelength What do we mean by dimensions? When you talk to mathematicians, they speak of 4-0 and 6-0 cubes and the 1 i ke. That is not what is meant by the concept of dimensions. What we are talking about is that in the roun you are sitting in there is every universe that has ever been created, all passing through the space you occupy. The only difference between them is wavelength. Wavelength, not frequency, is the key to everything. In our universe, all the way from the microcosm to the macrocosm, the wave- length is 7.23 centimeters long. This distance, 7.23an.,is also the approximate distance across the palm of the human hand and the distance that separates the various energy nodes up and down the human body. It was Be1 1 Laboratories who discovered the 7.23 an factor; when they first built their microwave trans- mission systems they used a wavelength of around 7 an, and when they turned it on it was filled with sane incredible static. They figured out that this static was caning fran everywhere around them."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV In quantum physics, every object can be looked at as consisting (depend- ing on your point of perception) as particles or waves (sound)(wavelength), and every piece of matter has its own sine-wave signature. If you were to take a11 the objects in the universe and average out the_wavelengths, you would find that the average is 7.23 cm for the wavelength of this universe. In Hindu or Tibetan terms, it is the sound OH. That's what On is. The universes themselves are separated-in terns-of wavelength distances in a way simi 1ar to that of music. In music, on . a piano, you have eight white keys which cwer the octave from C to C, and five black keys, which is another octave called the pentatonic octave. So, you have the eight white keys and the five black keys which make up the 13 notes of the chranatic scale. In effect, you have 12 notes, with the 13th as the return: Music and the electromagnetic spectrum are holographic in nature. You will find that between each of these notes there are 12 harmonic levels: 1 2 3 4 5 o..... ...... 0.. .....o...........o...........o...........o..... .o...........o...-.......o...etc- . ... So, the 12 dimensions each with 12 hamnic overtones is the 144 dimensional levels that are so often spoken of. The number 144,000 refers to the 1,000 cultures that caning f ram these dimensional levels. Evidence seem to suggest that whenever a planet is moving in the direction that Earth is moving, the mve is apparently assisted by these 144,000 cultures. The last note of the octave, again, is the return to the next higher octave. Each one of the harmonic overtones is an entirely different universe, and they are separated frun each other by a 90 degree phase rotation. If you were to change your conscious wavelength and rotate by 90 degrees at the same time, you would disappear from this universe and enter a different one that you were tuned to; you would be just as 'real' there as you are 'here'. There are several ways to accomplish that, and we will be discussing this later. Each of the overtone universes is just as vast as this one is. The nodes on either side of the overtones constitute what are called 'primary universes'. The entities known loosely as the 'ascended masters' exist at the loth, Ilth, and 12th overtones of the 6th universe. On the Earth exist all these universes, and your consciousness is primarily tuned to one of them. Uost individuals are lock- ed into this one because they don't know how to consciously leave it. The number of universes that exist is not infinite, but closely approximates infinity. Despite human focus on this particular wavelength, people interact within other overtones, since entities literally exist on all levels of existence at the same time. Human awareness, per se, is normally confined to a narrow range within the primary octave of existence. Each person has a different expression of awareness which covers hannonic levels specific to them at any one time."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV You will also find that all the universes a person is tuned into are all harrnonic to each other; people 'play different chords\". There is a level of consciousness known as the Uelchizedik that exists in_,the 13th dimension (going into the next octave); an entity that bas achieved this level of conscious has the capability of consciously existing in any one of the 144 overtones within the octave and remaining stable. The experience in each one of these 144 different universes in this octave is each completely different. Right now, we're sitting on the third dimensional level and we're about to move into an area between the 10th and 12th overtones of the fourth dimension. The awareness of other overtones make it easier to move into those levels. Most life in this universe exists in the primary levels; when humans 'die\" in this level, they go to an area primarily around the third overtone in the fourth dimension and often recycle back again for more experience and wisda; the 'cycling back' process has only been necessary for the last 13,000 years - it is about to ccnne to an end, as we shall see. The first and second overtones of the fourth dimension are somewhat dis- harmonic; they are what are loosely referred to as the 'astral plane' by the Hindu. It is where very pawerful thoughtforns have taken on a life of their own. The fourth overtone of the fourth dimension is where 'fairies\" and 'nature spirits\" appear to reside. Originally, entities now occupying human bodies existed in the sixth dimen- sion, which is about the maximum expansion for consciousness related to the Earth - although there have been individual entities that have achieved levels in the seventh dimension. What are called the 'angelic realms' start at about the 8th and 9th overtone of the fourth dimension, and what is called 'Christ Consciousness' starts fran the 10th to the 12th overtones of the fourth; the unity consciousness levels then prepare for focus in the fifth dimension, which is a whole new experience of existence. Dimensional Uovement Windows Apparently, movement of mass consciousness on a plsnetary scale between overtone levels only can take place within narrow \"windows' of time, and there is a 'window' period that is about to take place that humanity is in the process of preparing for right now on a worldwide level. Almost everything required for this to happen has already been completed; we are ready right now, and it could happen any time. When it does happen, it will happen rapidly, and probably witb in the space of one to three days. One of these windows in the past has been the period between January 10th and January 19th, with the window starting on the 11th and continuing until the 18th of the month. This one occurs every year, but the window that happened in 1992 was unique, according to some sources. In the future when we look back at 1992, it will be seen to be a year of great change in tenns of planetary history."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Ascension Processes to Come Apparently, it is felt within higher levels of consciousness in the 6th dimension that during the upcoming dimensional interface, every last Derson on the la net will m &the area in the upper fourth dimension, and that for - every hunran on Earth it is their last life on Earth. You will either undergo the conscious perception of the death processes of the physical body ('die') and resurrection and. get there, or you will go through in a body with 'your eyes wide open', as it were - that's called ascension. Either way, humans will end up in the saute place; it is not to say that all will remain there. Sacred Geometric Considerations The drawing by Leonardo Da Vinci known as the 'human canon' is shown below. The lines shown on the body delineate a star tetrahedron as shown; the star tetrahedron is fast becaning one of the most important shapes in human aware- ness. Geometric energy fields that are tetrahedronal have been found to surround every planet by NASA; there are additional tetrahedronal fields inside each of ACIAB = phi ADIDE = phi CEIDE = phi of the planets, and these fields correspond to events that are observable on the surface. Richard Hoagland's research reflects this newly acquired knowledge; the tetrahedronal grids are found around everything, and this has only been realized 39"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV within the last three years by orthodox science. Within the Da Vinci's drawing, the tetrahedron field around the human is connected to an octahedrmal field, a cubic field, a spherical field and so on, all the way out to a distance of about 55 feet, where it ends in another large spherical field. However, the tetra- hedron is one of the key symbols in the process of understanding har to move from one dimension to another. There is also a tube within the spinal chord of the human that conducts energy flows that pass between the apex of the top of the upward-pointing tetrahedronal field and the apex of the downward pointing tetrahedronal field. The upward field has a male, magnetic aspect; the dcm- ward field has a female, electrical aspect. Research has apparently been done with the electron microscope that showed the appearance of the tube in the first cell of the human body. We'll talk more about this later. The process of using the Herkaba involves rotating the tetrahedronal fields that surround the body, as well as 'breathing\" (taking energy in) through the abovenrentioned tube, which in an adult human is slightly over an inch in diameter.

Wavelenah and Geametrv The Sacred Geometry that is used as a language to discuss these things can be used to speak about anything, even emotions, such as love, have geometrical forms. Several scientists arolad the world have diwvered that.*a people were hooked up to electronic equipment, sine waves that were specific to each kind of emotion were detectable. These sine waves, when detected at a distance with remote equipment, can reveal the baseline emotional state of the person. Later, they discovered that all these sine wave signatures, when put to- gether, fond a geometrical image - they found out the gemmetry behind the feeling body for the human. At one point, we will show you what that is. Recently, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal on Sept 1991 that discussed the question 'do emotions have shapes you can see and reproduce?' The article discussed the research of Hanf red Klein, who found unique shapes that were associated with each feeling. Orthodox science will eventually find out that the human physical, emotional and mental bodies relate to specific geo- metric forms, and that they are all super-imposed tetrahedrons. The tetrahedron field for the physical body is more or less locked, and cannot move except under very special circumstances. The mental body tends to rotate counter clockwise to the left, it is electrical in nature and considered male in polarity. The other field, the emotional body, rotates clockwise to the right, is magnetic in nature and is female in polarity. When these three fields are linked together in very specific speed ratios, it produces the Merkaba field - the field of creation. Infornation Acceleration We have gathered so much information since Susrerian times. By 1900, we had gathered a certain relative level of infonnation. By 1950, we had doubled the amount of information that we had gained in 6,000 years. Fran 1950 to 1970 we doubled it again, and from 1970 to 1980 we doubled it again. NASA is so far behind getting infonnation into their computers where they can even use it, they are a1 ready eight years behind. We are reaching maxil~rms on many levels. Why is it happening in 1992? Why didn't it happen 10,000 years ago? There is something that needs to be noticed about our planet in order to understand what is happen- ing. The Precession of the Equinoxes The axis of the Earth has a wobble or tilt to it of about 23.5 degrees to the Sun. As the Earth goes around the Sun, this brings us the four seasons. The inclination of the wobble changes about 1 degree every 72 years, so about every 2,160 years the viewpoint changes one constellation, or about every 25,920 years we make one full precession of the equinoxes. The precession of the equinox has a tremendous impact on consciousness on the Earth. Every 42,000 years the angle of tilt, or obliquity, also goes through a cycle. About three years ago, they discovered another cycle on a galactic level, where there are 'dark 1 ight' and \"white light' spirals that function as absorption areas where stars and planets are destroyed and created. See the illustration on the top of the following Page -"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Dark and Light Galactic Spirals MERS OF THE SCULPTOR GROUP OF GALAXIES"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Sirian Influence on Our Galactic Orbit Our solar system is rotating around the galaxy in a spiral corkscrew path, and in order to do that, it has to be connected to something. Scientists began to research this, and eventually calculated in 1990 that our solar system is connected energetically to the Sirian system, specifically to Sirius A. This spiraling motion, deduced by an Australian scientist, is identical to the DNA spiral in configuration. We have a destiny with Sirius because we are tied to it, and that destiny is closely tied to the unfoldment of consciousness on Earth. At certain times, specific alignments with Sirius occur that have a profound effect. The Galactic Sphere Scientists have also discovered that there is a sphere of energy that lies outside and surrounds each galaxy. Outside that sphere is another inmense sphere that is gridlike in structure. The information was published in Scientific American magazine. So, there is a sphere within a sphere, and a physical body (galaxy) inside that. The same arrangement applies to the energy fields around humans. As above, so below. It also applies to solar systems and planets. The outer sphere of the Earth lies about 440,000 miles from the surface. The picture below is an infra-red photograph of a galaxy taken edgewise. The disk shape looks just like that of a spacecraft. When the Uerkaba field is going around you, that same shape pops out for 55 feet around you. Its influence goes into. space to a point about 160,000 miles in diameter. If two or nore people join together, a different kind of hrkaba is created that has an influence diameter of 1.6 million miles, and it has different potential than an individual one. In the Christian Bible, Jesus was supposed to have said, 'if two or more of you cane together, there I will be as well'. True 'Christ Consciousness\" cannot happen with one person. It requires two or more together, and once it happens you transcend the concept of 'two', or anything else for that matter."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV When two or more people join together, a type of Unity Consciousness that extends everywhere occurs. There are levels of Unity Consciousness even beyond that. We will discuss consciousness levels as we go. All 'UFOs' are based on internal k-rkaba technology. In those cases, two counter-rotating fields based on different mathematics are used to acheive an effect. Again, the field around galaxies is similarly produced, but in a natural way. Fran this standpoint, galaxies are also conscious beings - beings with a consciousness that we can't even dream of - and they are all in carrnunication with each other and have been for some time. In some ways, we are being allowed at this time to access these levels of consciousness. It is estimated that there are a minimum of 80,000 planets in our galaxy with the same level of developnent (and problems) that the Earth has. The main 'problem' was the result of what is called the 'Lucifer Rebellion', which we will discuss later. More on the Precession of the Equinoxes (Diagram Explained Below) Longer Wavelength/Lower Sound/Hale Control r C Shorter Wavelength/Higher Sound/Fenale Control f The elliptical pattern reflecting the movement of the axis of the planet is what takes 25,900 years to caaplete. The ancients, especially the Tibetans and the Hindu, generally agree that as we go away from the center of the galaxy in the precession, we fall asleep as a planet. After we turn the comer and come back the other way, the planet 'wakes up' in consciwsness. There is a 'dark' side and a 'light' side to the precession. The Tibetans broke the precession cycle up into what they called Yugas. The Hindu's did this as well. The thing is, most of the information about Yugas has been written during the past several thousand years, which unfortunately was during what was called the Kali Yuga, the point where planetary consciousness was mostly asleep. Most everything that was written during the past several thousand years was written by people that were essentially asleep, trying to interpret ancient writings they didn't even understand, while at the same time changing these writings in secret so no one would find out about them. Much of the data during this period describes the Yugas as lasting over 100,OO years - it is clear that they didn't understand what they were writing about. .LI 900 YRS - Galactic- Center"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV One thing the ancients did discover that is seemingly correct is that there are two points during the precession (one on each side) that are about 900 years from the end points that mark the point where the transition is made between 'dark' and 'light', or 'awake' to 'asleep'. Those points are marked with an 'X' on the drawing on the previous page. They are the 'horizon' points. Right now at this moment, we have just passed the 900 year entry point into the 'awake' zone. These points have always been associated with tremendous change taking place on the Earth. They are also associated with polar shifts that happen at that time. According to Thoth/Hennes, the degree to which the pole shifts is directly connected to consciousness and to how much consciousness changes on the planet. There is a mathematical integration between those two factors. There is a boob by John White called Pole Shift that provides much data on this point, particularly from the scientific point of view. There are also a lot of various predictions that are discussed about this type of event, and the shifting of the poles has been generally met with a lot of fear and trepidation. Though there was great fear about the pole shift, but because of certain changes which happened around 1972, which we will discuss, the situation may not be as violent this time around. As far as all the predictions made by Cayce, Nostrodamus and everyone else, you can throw them all out the window. All the predictions of all these people have gone off mark since 1972. In 1972, sane- thing happened that has apparently never happened before that has totally alter- ed the plan - it was sanething external that was inserted into the stream of events. Once we lay out enough groundwork, we will explain what that was. Right now it would make no sense to you. There are other aspects to the different side of the precession. The 'dark' side is generally a longer wavelength than the 'light' side, and the 'dark' side has a lower vibrational sound quality than the 'light' side. It is the male side which takes control on the 'dark' side as a protection factor, and the female side takes control on the 'light' side and brings us back around again. This has already happened. Each time, there is an actual physical person who is chosen to do this; this time it was a 23-year-old woman in Peru who was chosen to lead the progression for the next 12,000 years. This cycle was misinterpreted very recently and surfaced as data regarding a 'photon belt'. There are two periods of about 12,000 years that are added to two 900-year periods that equal the cycle of about 25,900 years. This whole pattern must be understood in order to see why all of this is happening now starting in 1992, rather than at any other time. We can't go much longer without major changes on incredible levels taking place. What we must mmember is that the way much of these changes happen is determined by the mass thoughts and feelings on the planet. According to most of the data given by John White, it is thought that the last polar shift centered around Hudson Bay in Canada. The magnetic pole was definitely in the Hawaiian Islands around 10,500 BC, which is interestingly the same time period referred to by Cayce. That point can be seen on the precession diagram on the previous page as the 'X' on the right side, representing 12,500 years ago, plus or minus 100 years. There were other things that have also happened during this period. A comet hit the Earth about 16,000 years ago, which upset the balance, and there was an- other event about 1,400 BC where it is described that on one side of the Earth"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"\"the sun stayed still in the sky\" for 20 hours, and on the other side of the planet it was dark for 20 hours. This has been documented worldwide. This is interesting, because it was right after that in 1,355 BC when the training involved with the \"right eye of Horus' was released through the Egyptians; the final bit of infomation was released'by Akhenaten - this we will get into in some detail later. Sitchin's Carmnentary on Solar System History According to Sitchin, there is a planet called Harduk with an elliptical orbit that carries it into proximity with Earth every 3,600 years. According to Sunerian records, there was also another planet in the solar system which they called Tiamat; records tell of an early cataclysm in which one of the moons of Marduk hit Tiamat, breaking it in half. Sitchins interpretation of Sumerian records suggests that one half of Tiamat broke up and became the asteroid belt that lies near the orbit of Mars, and that the other half reintegrated itself and became what we know as the Earth. There is no doubt that the asteroid belt may have been created in this way, but current knowledge of planetary fornation suggests that Earth was fonned separately from this incident documented in Sumerian writings. Sumerian writings appear to indicate that the Nefilim depended on the heat retention ability of the atmosphere of Uarduk to keep the planet warm while the orbit was farthest from our sun. At one point, something went wrong with their atmosphere, and it was determined by the Nefilim that a suspension of gold dust in their atmosphere would solve the problem. This was the alleged basis for the subsequent mining of gold that started about 430,000 years ago. Sumerian records appear to indicate that the Nefilim became weary of mining their om gold after about 200,000 years went by. They decided to create a subservient race (pm- sunably hrmans) to do this mining for them. Records of not only the Sumerians but many other sultures see^ to indicate that the Nefilim were from ten to sixteen feet in height and they wore beards. Records of the Inca and Mayan civilizations indicate that the races had a major preoccupation with the accumulation of gold, which might be seen as the result of a culturally engrained behavior pattern dating from earlier times when forced labor was employed toward this end. In fact, records indicate that these people didn't need gold for anything but maintained that 'it was for the gods'. The oldest gold mines that have ever been found are in western South Africa, and archeologists have found the bones of homo sapiens around the entrances to these deep mines that date back at least 100,000 years; my deposits of bones appear to have been deposited in cycles of about 20,000 years. Sitchin's concept of when the present version of hano sapiens was created was that it happened over 300,000 years ago. The rendition by ThothlHerrnes places it at 200,207 years ago- Parallels Between Sitchin and the Legends of the Oogon Sitchin speaks of the Anunnaki as having first landed in the oceans, emerg- ing as half-man, half-fish. The Dogons spoke about the same type of evolution relative to the Narmo. The concept of \"fish\" relates more accurately to the idea of the dolphin; available information suggests again that the dolphin came from"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV a planet near Sirius B. The Anunnaki entry into the water could have been to make contact with the dolphin population, which also had a humanoid counter- part back in the Sirian system. Evidence seems to suggest that that the dolphin and the Annunaki were able to maintain a relationship because they seemed to be on the same evolutionary level of consciousness. Sitchin did not realize this aspect when he did his research, as the Sumerian and Akkadian texts failed to mention it. American Indian Views of the Planet Earth The American Indians view the concept of our upcoming dimensional movement from a different perspective. They see us moving from the \"4th world\" into the \"5th world\", rather than from the \"3rd world\" to the \"4th world\". The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the Indians view The Great Void (from whence everything manifests) as a world in itself, thus increasing the dimensional count by one. They also view the change as a process of going from the surface of the Earth outward, through physical layers. Many Indian creation stories relate how they 'came out of the Earth', and how there was a finite space above the surface of the Earth. When the time came to go, they would ascend to the upper levels and break through onto a new surface of the Earth. This is the belief system that is comnon, and it reflects their conscious level of percept- ion of cosmic continuity. The Actual Astrological Position of the Earth and Its Connection to the Sphinx At the current position of the Earth, we are in Virgo going into Leo; if you look at the far side of the galaxy from our viewpoint, you see a transition from Pisces to Aquarius, but that is what we are seeing - it is not where we are situated while viewing it. As you will see later, this has a bearing on why the Sphinx is conceptually a blending of the 'virgin' and the 'lion\", and why it might have been placed there to reflect the period in Earths history where we are at developmentally. Geological Records Reflecting Pole Shifts If you look at the geological history of northern Siberia, you will discover layers in the earth where there are humans, bison and other animals all shredded up in disarray and frozen solid, seeming victims of a major geological event; the animals had fresh tropical fruit in their stanachs, indicating a different climate than Siberia currently has. Geological investigation of arctic areas has revealed over 200 different structures of ice depending on the nature of the freezing. Research seems to indicate that the whole process of freezing during this event took less than a day to happen. There are several theories regarding how the process of axis shifting works. One of the more recent ones concerns the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) relationship between the stability of the axis and earths magnetic field. If the field collapsed, it would result in an instability in the axial spin of the planet. Research done in laboratories regarding this effect has demonstrated that there is a definite structural 1 ink between the interior and the surface of the earth that is maintained electronically by the presence of the magnetic field. When the field collapses, certain geological structures becune more fluid in nature, and this allows unusual movement of plates and other subsurface structures. Whatever the causes, a polar shift"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV happens rapidly, and is usually accompanied by extreme wind velocity and gecr logical disturbances that devastate areas on the surface of the planet. The last time there was a polar shift, it was a large one. Cayce stated that the shifting will happen at 16 degrees. 'Scientists, including David Suzuki in Canada, have come up with 15.75 degrees tilt. Whatever the activity, there will be a consciousness shift associated with the process. The last large shift was a shift from the positive side to the negative one as far as consciousness was concerned. Orthodox scientists did not generally accept the idea of an axis shift until around 1950, when they discoveted evidence for a shift 10,500 years ago. At that point, the concept of an axis shift became a 'once in a million year' thing, whereby they discovered that there had been another shift about 12,OO years before the one they discovered. This locked down the scientific evidence for them that these things occur on a regular basis. Geological investigation into magnetic patterns in the material of the Earth revealed that the patterns have been shifting at an increasing frequency. Planetary Progressions into Unity Consciousness The evolution of a planetary population appears to consist of a certain number of stages between social consciousness and unity consciousness. What is usually not discussed is the fact that everyone eventually makes the transit- ion. The key word is eventually. What usually happens on a planetary scale is that during the developaent of the population, only so my individuals reach this mode of consciousness - at that point either another cycle begins on the planet or the cycle is taken off the planet entirely to develop elsewhere. Thus, there evolved in popular religious thought the idea of the 'many are called-few are chosen' scenario. When a planet approaches a critical stage in the evolution of the population, for example, you might have a population consisting of N levels of consciousness. If the degree of change is such that bodily existence is eliminated on the planet due to geological events, all individuals will move to N levels of resonance that are harmonious to them, albeit on a different wavelength of physicality or non-physicality. A movement of the population from the third dimension to the fourth dimension as a mass consciousness does not mean that everyone will stay in the fourth dimension - since in increase in dimensionality allows easier manifestation by virtue of thoughts and feelings, individual entities that are emotionally unbalanced will more easily put them- selves in a position that is awkward, and they will move to a different area that praises more hannonic stability with their nature. It is also possible for an entire planet to go into unity or Christ Consciousness. At that point they have acquired the dimensional freedom to move into even higher octaves of experience with increasing rapidity. Current Ecological Instabilities Research indicates that the existing problems on Earth with the environment and other factors are much worse than the public is led.to believe. In 1985, no one wanted to hear about environmental damage, and they really didn't believe it anyway. In 1989, the goverments decided to start releasing what appeared to be the truth, bit by bit. There are many problem areas, and if any one of them goes too far, all third dimensional life will cease to exist on Earth. All areas"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"in the environment are breaking down. About twelve years ago, Jacques Cousteau wrote a book in which he made several claims that orthodox science did not agree with. He said that by the year 1990, the Uediterranean would be a dead body of water. By 1992, it was 95% dead, with hardly any life in it at all. The other oceans are following suit, and it wi 11 probably take about fifteen to twenty years before a1 1 the oceans are dead and the bottan side of the food chain is eliminated. It is felt that once all the plankton are dead, everything else on the planet will follow suit. In the early 1980's scientists were examining the upper layers of the atmosphere relative to the ozone question, and found atmospheric pollutants at concentrations of over 500 tines nonnal. By 1992, these pollutants have risen to thousands of times normal levels. Even if pollutants stopped today, it would not have any measurable effect for decades and possibly hundreds of years. In 1981, an April 15th article in Time magazine revealed 'the ozone hole' was 21 times worse than scientists had thought, and that there would be another 400,000 people die because of increased solar radiation and skin cancer. Within two weeks after this announcement, on Hay 20, 1991, scientists announced that 'it was twice as bad as we thought'. In February 1992, scientists announced that 'it is much worse than we thought'. If the ozone layer is depleted, animals all over the planet will go blind and expire. By 1992, approximately 50% of populations in high altitude areas had skin cancer. Now, they are broadcasting advisories that warn people not to go outside between certain hours of the day unless you are protected. Forner president Reagan thought it was a joke, and quipped that 'maybe everyone should go out in trench coats and sunglasses' frun then on. There will be no measurable ozone layer within ten years. What the 'Greenhouse' Effect Really Means When'~eorge Bush got into office, hundreds of environmntalists went to him and voiced their concern over the 'greenhouse effect'. If you really know what is going on with the 'greenhouse effect', you will realize that we are not going to get wanner - we're going to get colder and within about five more years we will be on the throes of a small ice age. How is this possible? If you study the patterns through geological time, you will realize that for nil 1 ions of years there has been a cycle of 90,000 years of cold and 10,000 years of warn repeated over and over. We just had 10,000 years of warn, and we would characteristically be going into an ice age even if huaan beings were not on the planet. The whole cycle of cold and warn has to do with minerals and plants, especially trees. One acre of trees holds 50 tons of carbon dioxide, and this is released when they die. Without exception, trees all over the planet are dying. The minerals that are tied to keeping trees alive are produced by the ice ages, when minerals are ground up and put into the soil. After about 10,000 years, the minerals are gone and the trees die, releasing all their carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide has the effect of increasing the temperature at the equatorial regions of the planet, which causes billions of tons of water to be added to the atmosphere; it also decreases the temperature at the poles, because the increas- ed levels of carbon dioxide prevent critical wavelengths of ice-mielting infra- red radiation fm getting through the atmsphere to the surface. The polar ice cap increases and movement of populations takes place because certain parts of the planet become inhabitable, A1 1 these detai 1s are 'general 1 y being kept f ran the general public, allowing the perception of 'an infinite .future of prunise' to be perpetrated on an ignorant society, while the elite scramble for consolidation of power and survival. 49"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The result of this 'greenhouse effect' is that the planet becomes covered with a layer of cloud for about 90,000 years. Geologists have studied this phenanenon in recent years in sane detail, and have concluded that it takes about 20 years for the transition between 'warn' and 'cold' to take place. We are at least 15 years into that 20 year period. The average temperature in most northern and southern latitudes will reach 50 degrees below zero within one year after the 'cold' period begins. Geological Results of Nuclear Testing Researcher Adam Tranbley revealed that we have exploded over 212 nuclear devices above ground since the early 1940's. There is evidence that this testing has contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer by forcing CFC's, which are four times heavier than air, into the upper atmosphere. Government's have been blaming consumer use of CFC's for the problem, forcing sociological and economic changes on the population using this as an excuse. Governments don't want to admit the responsibility, so they're trying to invoke public \"guilt' which will a1 law nore repressive legislation to be invoked. Granted, there are other types of substances that are involved in depletion of the ozone layer, but how the CFC compounds got up there was not natural. After above ground nuclear testing became controversial, underground testing of nuclear devices began. The shock waves from underground nuclear explosions reverberate within the earth for an extended period of time, and contribute to changes in the structure of geological layers. Tranbley calculated that if they continued to do this, we would start to notice changes on the surface. The Indian Ocean has dropped about twenty feet in the last several years. Areas where he predicted changes are beginning to bulge or sink, and it is felt that the underground nuclear testing has contributed significantly to these changes. The Diflexion Crystal Mystery Around 1927 in Poland, they found that if you took natural piezoelectric quartz crystal and applied certain radio frequencies along the C-axis of the crystal, it began to rotate the structure of the crystal lattice. When the rotation reached a specific angle, the crystal simply disappeared. What was happening is the ions in the crystal began to migrate along very specific lines through space and refom the lattice structure at greater distances - this resulted in the crystal growing in size, sametimes as much as 2000%. When a diflexion crystal was in that expanded state, it would absorb 1002 of the energy that passed through it - everything - even the explosion from a nuclear device. The energy could also be removed slowly through different methods. Another sspect of the expanded diflexion crystal is that it levitated while in its expanded state, and it would move with tremendous force in the direction of the C-axis. So, you have the possibility of building a vehicle that cwld fly on nothing but starlight. With seven superconducting diflexion crystals and six regular crystal plates as insulators, you cwld build such a craft. The design would involve setting all the crystals with their C-axes facing outward and a radio source in the middle. The problem arises when you try to cut a diflexion crystal after it has absorbed energy. It would collapse and release all the energy and explode. They have been trying to solve this problem for sane years, and that is what the crystal technology labs in New Mexico have as their top 50"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV priority. Lately, it would appear that the Japanese might have solved the problem, because for the last three years, the Japanese have been going around buying up all the natural piezoelectric crystal on the planet that they can find. They know that someday it will be priceless, but pretty soon all of this will be utterly meaningless. Ambient Viruses and Pathogens With AIDS and other viruses rampant, some researchers are looking for alternative answers to this sociological problem. Royal Rife was on the right track with his frequency equipment, as viral bodies vibrate with their om intrinsic frequency which also reflects one of 13 geometric foms and wave lengths. Rife would find the vibratory rate which would disrupt the organism and it would shatter, but Rife only knew 7 of the 13 wavelengths. Viruses are geometric forms associated with the five platonic solids. Due to the population limits of the Earth, as perceived by some factions, pathogenic organisms are one way to reduce the existing population. The people who designed the virus are already aware that the cure lies in the frequency realm, and they have it already - they just need more people to die first before they 'suddenly' make the 'discovery\". If you know all the wavelengths, you can disrupt any viral organism. Facing the Sociological Music From a standard third dimensional point of view, there are so many things going on now that people would be lucky to make it to the next century. The concept of having children and watching the children grow up and go to college and watching their children grow up - if you really know what's going on, you'll have to leave that sociological concept behind. On a three dimensional basis, we are on a sinking boat; now is truly the tine to focus your energy on raising your consciousness, because you can't stay here. In the final analysis, after it is all over and we have made the shift in consciousness, everything will be fine, but now people have to wake up and realize that this Earth - the 7.23cm wavelength Earth - will no longer available as a viable environment. If you were to leave the planet and come back in 50 'years, it would look very much like Venus or Mars - it will be a dead place. Life will still be here, but on a slightly shorter wavelength; this place is already there waiting for us, and from that standpoint there's no problem. You just have to learn haw to get there, and it isn't that hard; it will happen as a matter of course in the very near future. For people to make the change and remain conscious the whole time, they need to understand and use the vehicle of the counter-rotating fields. The New Wavelength . .. - As we move from overtones in the third dimension to overtones in'the fourth, consciousness will be focused on a shorter wavelength and a higher dimensional energy level. The Christian Bible refers to this \"place\" as \"heaven\"; many other re1 igious and spiritual systems also have given the concept special names. Many parameters of dimensional areas are also discussed in Robert Monroe's second book, Far Journeys, especially in the second half of the book."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV It is apparently against normal principles for one species to interfere with another one; the grays are permitted to be involved for reasons we shall discuss later. Because of the circumstances on Earth at this time, the planet is the focus of many species. Races that wish to observe or interact with a planet seem to make their approach at least one dimehsional overtone higher than what the planet sits on. Different species that have done this are invisible to humans, as a rule, but have no trouble interacting with or monitoring the population. Right now, the two overtones above the Earth wavelength are so full of ships around the planet, it sort of looks like a parking lot at a football game. The situation on Earth (and we will explain that as we go along) is one of the most unusual situations that have ever occurred in planetary evolution, and it is evoking interest everywhere on all levels - way above the nonnal 144,000 beings that arrive for a simple dimensional evolvement. There are even distant galaxies that are here. The focus of attention from everywhere is also affecting and accelerating processes. With a few exceptions, the groups that are in proximity to the Earth at this time exist in light-body format. The light body is their vehicle for getting here. We wi 11 eventual 1 Y set to that mint - in fact. we once had that capa- - - bility but lost it. We no longer have it any more. The Spiral Nature of the Precession, Time, and Historical Interpretation In actuality, the precession is not an ellipse or circle, but it is a spiral, corkscrew shaped path that is shaped just like a DNA complex. The level of consciousness during the \"wake' and 'sleep\" cycles varies but always increases. Each time around the cycle the level of consciousness changes up and down in wavelength, but each time around the cycle the overall average goes a 1 ittle higher. This is one reason why archaeologists fail to clearly understand what they look at, what they are supposed to be looking for, and what questions to ask of themselves about the Earth and its history. Archaeologists think that time is strictly a linear concept. But time in all these dimensional levels is always experienced in different ways. What may be experienced as five minutes here may be equivalent to a thousand years on a different wavelength. Archaeologists cannot view the Earth in their nonnal way and understand what the Earth as a planet has experienced, because existence is multi4imensional. They don't even know what to look for. Consciousness and Chromosome Configuration - - -- According to available research, there are five general levels of conscious- ness that relate directly to chranosome configuration. The first level involves 42+2 chromosomes, and represents the first time self-aware consciousness becomes focussed out of The Great Void. We will see that through geometry when we discuss it. The next level is 44+2, which is the current level of most of the human population. It is an intermediate dis-harmonic step between 42+2 and the next level, which is 46+2 chranosaaes, which relates to the level of \"Christ"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Consciousness'. The next step after that is another dis-harmonic level at 48+2 chramsanes; the last step is 50t.2 chromosomes, which is connected with a higher level of Unity Consciousness. There are bands of physical height that are associated with these chrolaosane levels: Chromosune Level Range of Physical Height 42 + 2 3.5 to 5.5 Aboriginal Tribes 44+2 5.0 to 7.0 feet 46 + 2 Light Body 10.0 to 16.0 feet 48+2 Light Body 20.0 to 30.0 feet 50 + 2 Light Body 50.0 to 60.0 feet Physical bodies in the third level and above have progressively less mss; the distance between atomic structures increases dramatically and the energy associated with the body increases. Obviously, gravity has less of a physical effect on a series of bodies with progressively less mass. This is why a being in the first overtone of the 4th dimension can walk thmugh a wall that lies in the 11th overtone of the 3rd dimension. Su~lerian records and wall reliefs regularly depict very large size beings . right next to 'nomal' sized beings. Lacking proper knowledge of these matters, it is no surprise why it never occurred to archaeologists that the depictions reflected actual conditions long ago on Earth. The Olmc civilization depict the same kind of height disparities in their records, as do the records of the Egyptians. Religious literature also discusses beings that are much larger than present day humans. In the Christian Bible, the sixth chapter of Genesis reads: '...and it came to pass, when men began to nnrltlply on the face of the Earth, and daughters were born unto them. The Sons of God saw the daughters of men which were fair, and they took for themselves wives, all which they chse....there were giants in the Earth in those days, and also after that, when the Sons of God came into the daughters of men, and they bore children unto them. The same mighty men of old, ' lnen of renown... It did not say that 'God' did these things - it was the Sons of God, which were those beings on the Earth that were in one of the levels of Unity Consciousness. In that level, there is really only one consciousness that moves through all of them. They are like single cells in a body. The 42+2 level of consciousness was identified in Australian aborigines and in sane African tribes by scientists sane years ago. The level of consciousness that relates to 42+2 has sanetimes been referred to as 'dream time', which is"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"the first level of Unity Consciousness. The consciousness of some alien species interacting with hunans has been readily identified as a group consciousness; there are many examples that detail social behavior of certain species of Gray that indicate that they are literally \"of one mind'. This is also the reason why some alien species view the whole universe as 'mind' and view the concept of the creator in the same way - they cannot view it othenise in a group conscious- ness. The question remains as to how to compare the group consciousness of certain alien species with the group consciousness-of aborigines, or what the specific quality is that separates th both and makes them unique. Also, it is possible that dis-harmonic levels of consciousness (44+2 and 48+2) are levels where individual identity is taken on in order to provide a periodic vantage point in order to enhance experience, which is then shared on a group level in harmonic stages of developl#nt. Apparently, one of the keys to all this is memory. When we first cme into developaent, we were in a Unity Consciousness and a1 1 the beings on Earth were really one spirit occupying a grwp of bodies. An analogy would be that all the cells in ywr body have individual consciousness of a certain order, and that the body itself has a consciousness which is the gestalt of cellular conscious ness and memory, yet the entity that occupies the body, you, have the ultimate reign over the whole body. According to the aborigines, who have a fom of unity consciousness, an experience of anyone in the group can be reexperienced by any body else in the group. Analysis indicates that this might differ fror the kind of group consciousness experienced by certain a1 ien groups, such as the Grays, in that the experience of one member of the group is imediately the experience of all. There is no separation that would pernit or necessitate 'wperience.' An actual experience of aboriginal 'dream time' could be characterized in this way. Suppose one of the members walked into a r#m in a hwse, looked at different objects in the room, and left. Another member of the grwp could access that memory in consciousness, go into the roan, pick objects up and examine them, and have complete access to all the perceptive aspects of the location in a holographic way. For beings in the 44+2 level of consciousness, they are separated fran each other in consciousness. Experiences of one being are barely accessible by another. There is no collective memory. Beings In the 46+2 harnonic level go back into a 'unity body' with one 'spirit\" moving through it all, and the memory is upgraded. When a 'Christ Consciwsness' being 'remabers' samething, it becams real and manifested into existence on a physical level. If a person in this level of consciousness 're membered' an orange, it would appear in their hand and they could peel it and eat it. The memory that they have is also within the arerory of a1 1 beings who have ever accessed that level of consciwsness, or who ever wi 7 7 access that level of consciousness. Time is spherical in nature, and there is no \"past\", \"present' and 'future' type of linearity. Everything is happening at once in the now. This is also where humanity is headed."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Abu SiPlbel In the Nile Valley in Egypt, the temples were apparently laid out in terms of the energy chakras of the human body.

The ancient Sumerian records detail this event, but say that it was two sets of seven beings. They could not apparently leave without leaving a level of consciwsness behind, so they created an ow by linking geanetrically, which produced a large cold blue-white flame about four feet high in the middle of the group. This flame was then put into was called the Halls of Amenti, an ancient place built before the Sphinx, more than six million years ago; it is wcnnb shaped and constitutes a dimensional warp in space that lies one overtone in wavelength higher that that of the Earth, and always rearaim that way. It usually sits just outside the membrane which surrounds Earth at a distance of 440,000 miles. There is evidence that the Halls of Amenti was located on the surface of the Earth on a mountain top during Atlantean times, but in modern times sits about 1,000 miles inside the Earth. According to history, inside the Halls of Amenti is a large pyramid, and inside the pyramid is a roaa built in the proportions of a Golden Mean rectangle. The flame was placed in this room, where it remains. While all this was happening, other activity was going on in the Sirian (B) system on the third planet, where a family of 16 males and 16 females came to Earth; this was 200,207 years ago according to the records. They went to the Halls of Amenti and manifested from their ne#rry 32 slabs of rose quartz granite about 20 feet long, which they put in a circular pattern with the flame in the middle. Males and females reclined on the slabs and merged with the flame. The result was the creation of several races. The Sraerians detai 1 this event in terms of 'the creators' doing genetic engineering, but they do not mtion the Halls of Amenti or the blue flame that was apparently involved in this process. Sociological Pairing and Ambient Atcmic Matrices It is unusual for us to think of the idea of a marriage between 32 people, but it is not actually unusual. How females and males dine in the universe is a direct reflection of the nature of atomic fusion within the planet and sun where the beings reside. Because Earth has a hydrogen sun, beings on the Earth mate naturally in pairs. Life on Earth confonas to that matrix. When the helitnu concentration eventually reaches a certain level, it will then have a matrix of a helium sun where three helium atoms will cme together and form carbon. You will then have a whole situation within Earths solar system where two males and two fernales will merge together. As you examine very old stars, as in the Sirian system, you will see that very large families begin to form."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Rise of Gandawanaland Sanewhere around 200,000 years ago on Earth there was a large shifting 'of the planetary axis, and a land mass arose off the southwest coast of Africa. The exact size and shape is not known, but it was an island. Creation stories of the tribes in Africa are somewhat different, but they have one thing in cammn; they all relate that their origin was an island to the west which they called Ganda- wanaland. The Sunerian reports detail that southwestern Africa is where hano sapiens were created and also where they were used to mine gold. This area was not where Edin was located; E-din was located in what is now southern Iraq, according to Sumerian records, and was a tropical area instead of a desert as it is today. There is some degree of genealogical proof that hano sapiens was created in this area.

The tall beings that managed the gardens loved the humans, but the humans were told not to \"eat of the tree of life\", which of course they did, and gained the ability to sexually reproduce, which is what the creators did not want. Humans, all this time, had been reproduced in laboratories. After humans gained the knowledge of sexual . reproduction, they were made to leave the gardens of Hin. All the details about this event that are found in the Christian Bible were in the Sunerian records a long tine before the docunents comprising the Bible were ever prepared, including the lineage of the first humans created. .The Rise of Lemuria The tall beings allawed humans to grow on their they still maintained the use of hu~lans for mining archeological records indicate that hunans were in 100,000 years ago working gold mines. own after this event, but operations in Africa. The southern Africa at least According to Thoth, hmns remained there for soare time until there was a large shift in consciousness and awareness which paralleled a polar shift, whereupon Gondawanaland sank. The survivors went primarily to western Africa, and this is apparent because it is U# single element that runs through all the creation stories of all the people in this part of the planet. Sane survivors went to South America. A small group of survivors who were the nost evolved went to another land mass that rose when Gondawanaland sank. This other land laass was later known as Lemuria. Lemuria extended fran the Hawaiian islands all the way to Easter Island, and it consisted of thousands of islands' which fonned more or less a single land mass. Humans began to evolve very rapidly here. As a side note, from about the turn of the 20th century until about World War I, the 'New Age\" was in full swing. People were interested in Lemuria and Atlantis and all sorts of psychotronic devices. When World War I broke out, all of this interest was shut off. Interest never resumed until the 1960's. They have proven scientifically that Lmuria was there. In a book written in 1919 called \"Atlantis, Mother of All Countries\", the data which proved the existance of Lemuria was given. One piece of data had to do with coral. Coral can only grow under the surface of the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"water to a depth of 150 feet. They found the rings of coral in various areas where the islands of Lemuria had existed, and the aral was 1800 feet deep, which meant that the islands went down very slowly over an extended period of time. Another bit of information is that the fauna and the flora on a great number of islands on the chain that extends from the Hawaiian islands (which was the western shore area of Lemuria) a1 1 the way down to Easter Island. It is a string of islands separated by hundreds of miles that make a straight line. These islands have the same planets, animals, insects and bacteria. There is no way that this cwld happen unless they had originally been joined as a larger land mass previously. When the consciousness of a planet takes off, it becones either aale or female in nature. At this time, the planetary consciousness was becaning female in nature. The planetary consciousness was roughly equivalent to about a twelveyear-old female. An entire right-brained feminine technology developed within Laria that could do even more than our present technology could do, based on principles having to do with psychotronic devices; devices where there was a linkage with the mind and emotions. Again, there were two races in Lemuria; the controlling race which was alien in nature and the developing hunans. A lot of work on the hunan spinal column and cranim went on during this period, which changed and accelerated the evolution of hmans. Things went well during this time. One day, about 1000 years before Lanuria went under the sea (which is was doing very slowly from the very time it rose from the ocean floor), after it had been there for 60,000 to 70,000 years, the woman known as Teye (who had case from Gandawanaland) and her husband Ay had a child. In having this child, they became enlightened. A three of them went into the next level of understanding and went into Christ-consciousness and became inmortal beings. They were no longer subject to death of the physical body. Inmortality does not mean living in a body forever - that's called a trap - it means never having a break in consciousness - always having a continuous 58"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV memory from then on - that's inmortality. It also means that you can leave the body when to want to leave the body. This happened to Teye, her husband and chi Id about this time, which would be roughly 80,000 years ago. They did not realize inmediately that they had achieved this state; they realized after a time that they had been alive a long long ti= - hundreds of years went by. They fonmd a school which was knom as the Naacal Mystery School, which was designed to teach ascension. They taught many people, and during the last 1000 years they managed to get 1000 people to this state. This was a better record than the schools of Atlantis that were to m; the Atlantean schools lasted wer 20,000 years and only graduated so# 600 maple. The Rising of the Atlantean Islands It was during the last 1,000 years of Lemurla when the island started to sink at an increasing rate. The people of Lemuria were right-brain oriemted, feminine and very psychic - they knew that the island was sinking. They left the island and went primarily to North and South America on the vestern coast; the extent of their settlement in these areas ranged f ran Lake Titicaca in Pew to the area of bunt Shasta in California. Same went elsewhere, This olajor core group of 1,000 iamortal beings during the last days of Leauria, observed another land mass which rose in conjunction with the attendent pole shift and the sinking of Leauria. This continent was later known as Atlantis. Atlantis Was composed of ten islands; a main island, one island north, one island south, one island east of the main island and six islands to the west of the main island- The six islands to the west are now knam as the Florida Keys; at that tile what we knov as Florida and a great part of the Southern United States was mt . - water. These 1,000 inmortal beings flew ftm Lesluria to the northern gost Island of Atlantis, Udall, and they established a city. Upm arrival, they divided the island dawn the middle, north to south, with a wall that was 40 feet high and 20 feet wide. They then built a smaller wall from east to west, which resulted in Udall being divided into four quadrants. These walls no doubt took a very short time for 1,000 Christ Conscious beings to erect. LEFT N RIM What these people were doing was beginning to duplicate the human mind, which is divided into two parts and four quadrants, with the corpus callosm running down the middle.

What you are going to find is that the experiential side of the male is light and visual-ness, whereas the experiential side of the female is sound and vibra- tion. Back to the story. They built the island of Udall in this manner, and they put about half of the 1,000 irraortals on one side and the other half on the other side. Half of them became the logical thinkers and the other half becrane the feminineoriented psychics on the other side. The structures that were built on each side paralleled the geometry associated with that side. They did this until they got to a state where the island had a greater-than-the-parts consciousness. When that happened, according to Thoth, they projected onto the main island the Tree of Life pattern. Ten areas on the island began vibrating according to specific Tree of Life patterns. A standing wavefom was laid wt on the island in this way, using thought and emotion. Vortices of energy began rotating out of these ten spats on the main island. These vortices began to attract other Leanrrians along the African coast, North and South America, and other areas to the specific vortices that suited their nature. )hjor cities developed on the Atlantean mainland when people migrated to these areas. The evolutionary pattern of Lewria was such that they only had the nature of eight out of the ten vorti,ws. The temaining two areas went unsettled. This is where the beginning .of the problw~ happened. If the Laaurian's had been more advanced and had filled these two vortex areas, we would be an entirely different planet right now. The 'Lucifer Rebel 1 ion' What ended up happening is that they pulled in two extraterrestrial species into Atlantis at that ti=, in the very beginning. These two extraterrestrial species joined with our consciwsness and beccuae pert of our evolutionary pattern. The first one were the Hebrews. According to Thoth, the Hebrews were a much older race who had made a misjudgaent and had to repeat a lesson of sme kind and came to Earth to do it. The Hebrews brought with them advanced information that consisted of higher levels of life, and in a sense sped up the evolutionary pattern. They were not the problem. The problem was with the species who entered into the tenth vortex, and we know exactly where this one came from. The tenth one was a race of beings that came fran Mars. They were not from the Mars that we see out there today, which is basically a dead planet on the third dimension. They were fran Mars approximately a million years ago. It is the opinion of Richard Hoagland that the Martians made this shift at a later"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV CONCEPTUAL DRAWING OF TB% VORTICES SET UP IN ATLANTIS"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV time, however according to Thoth, Mars was very similar to Earth about a million years ago - it had an atmosphere, oceans and water and was the boa# af a super- advanced civilization. The only problem was that the Uartians were starting to get into s-thing we could call the Lucifer rebellion. Briefly, Lucifer was considered one of the most incredible bei.ngs created. He had a slight flaw in that he thought himself better than the creator. Lucifer knew the creation pattern - the Merkabah, which creates all things. Originally the Merlcabah was only to be created f roln internal technology, body centered, based on thoughts and feelings. What Lucifer did was that he created the Merkabah externally, thrwgh electronics; it was one that he could get into and ascend into the heights - he created what we now refer to as a 'UFO' - a mechanical flying vehicle. tk was not the first one to do this - it had been done thme tines before since the creation of this particular universe (which is in itself an experiment which is not completed). Other beings have attempted to do this external Merkabah process, and it resulted in total chaos. When Lucifer started to do this about 200,000 years ago (about the time when humans were first being conceived on Earth), he convinced about one third of the angelic beings to participate in this process. The last time this took place was several hundred million years prior to this. The race on Uars a million years ago was just recovering froln the third rebellion, which resulted in planets that were dying everywhere. The reason is this: when you create a Merkabah from your mind and heart using love, its a living field around your body. When you create tJm field externally, you don't have to use love or the emotional body - only the intellect. What that does is that it creates a being who only has a left brain orientation and no emotional body. A good example is solpe of the species known as the 'grays'. The 'grays', who resulted fran this process, have been around a long time, but they were actually youngsters compared to the race on Mars. The race on Mars were a race that was totally logical. They understood every detai 1 of the reality - they cwld do anything - but they had no lwe or erotional canplex. For this reason, Mars was constantly involved in wars. Finally, it became so violent that the atmosphere on Mars was blm away and everything died. Prior to the total death of the planet, the Martian race built a wnunent complex which describes in mathematical detail haw the brkabah was created. The space-time vehicle of the external Uerkabah was used by a satall nunber of the race on Uars to escape the planet during its final death throes. They left and were able to look through time and space and see that ahead in time there was this spinning vortex on Earth about a million years ahead (about 65,000 years ago in our past) and they went into it. They joined with the hunan evolutionary pattern. We did not want them to be here. The general mass consciousness of the human race was equivalent to a fourteewyear-old girl at that time - the Martian race was equivalent to a 65-year old man. They basically 'taped' the hunan race, and stepped in and said 'you're ours, like it or not'. They tried to take wet Atlantis imnediately, but there were not enough of them to accolaplish it. They finally relented and consented to 'try the feminine way' of Earth, although they did not understand it. They tried it for roughly 50,000 years in an attempt to merge with us, but there were always problems with them. They maintained themselves in a separate area of Atlantis away fran the test of the population. Everything went along pretty well until exactly one cycle back in the 26,000 year precession of the equinox, which is approximately the same position where we are at this manent in 1992. There was a small shift in the axis and a piece of Atlantis fell into the ocean. That piece happened to be in the area where the Martians lived. They became very upset over this, and there was a general fear that extended over Atlantis for 200 years, because the general population had lost most of the feminine psychic ability they had due to the influence of the 64"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV logic of the Uartian race and they were concerned that Atlantis could sink again like Lemuria had done. This was the first event that happened. About 16,000 years ago an asteroid hit the Earth just about where Charles- ton, South Carolina is right now (this area was under water at the time). This can readily verified geologically. The mants of this strike are spread over four states. This asteroid strike just missed Atlantis. The Atlanteans knew for a long time that this asteroid was on a collision course with the Earth. This was a very advanced civilization - much more advanced that our civilization today. The Martians pushed to have the asteroid blom up before it reached Earth, but relented to the feminine aspect of the planet which preferred to let things fa1 1 as they may. The asteroid hit and a huge area of Atlantis sank - it was an area that was almost totally occupied by the Martians. They were furious and they decided to never listen to the others again. They decided to go on their awn way and began to set up another experiment to create a Clerkabah, built externally. They brought the sickness of the third rebellion to Earth. The purpose of this was to gain total control over the Earth, but the experiment got out of control and major damage began to happen. They used crystalline technology to create the Merkabah. Dimensional levels around Atlantis were ripped open in a huge vortex. It caused entities fron other dimensional levels to be thrwn into our dimnsion; these entities cam in by the billions and went right into the bodies of the Atlanteans. The ascended rasters on the sixth level did everything they could to restore the situation, but much of the damage was not repairable; without their efforts we would not even be alive at this time. Oespite their efforts, every Atlantean had fron twenty to one hundred other beings inside them. Everything began to fall apart and there was no hamy left. It was such worse than it is on Earth in 1992, although we are approaching that scre kind of dishammy- again. All this happened about 16,000 years ago. These entities from other dimensional levels, brought in by the dimensional warp during the time of Atlantis are still here. If you have done psychutherapy and have worked to remove these entities out of people, you know what is spoken of here. These entities do not want to be here, but they have to live in a body. A large nunber of people today sti 11 have these entities f ran another dimen- sional level inside them. The most efficient way to return these entities back to their point of origin is to create a very specific octahedral field that they cannot get out of and hook it to their dimension. To them it is like brilliant white light and they disappear very quickly. For about 4,000 years after this evemt in Atlantis, things got progressively worse. It was at this time that it was decided by higher levels to find a situation that would be a wiwin situation for everyone. They could not terminate species, because that is not the way life operates. Galactic levels were brought in to address this problem on Earth. At that time on Earth, hrnans were primarily on the first harmonic level of consciousness, 42+2 chror~osanes. It was decided that if hunans could be brought to the third harmonic level of consciousness, then the problems would be solved. The plan was to introduce Christ Consciousness to the planet synthetically, ahead of time - this is what was decided. Thoth and others were given the blueprint on how to do this, and they flew from Atlantis to a little knom place that they called Khim, which we now call Egypt. At that time it was not a desert but a tropical jungle. They flew there 65"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV because the flame that was in the Halls of Amenti had an axis pole that carae out of the Earth at that point. There was an entire grid that was associated with that pole that would saneday be formed from that axis point. They went to this spot on a Gizeh plateau about a mile away fran the pyramids, where there was a sarall opening in the ground. This spot was not knawn about until a few years ago. Sometime ago, an aerial photograph was taken of the pyramid complex and it was noticed that they were sitting on a logarithmic spiral: Follaring that spiral to the center, they discovered this hole, which according to Thoth originally went a mile into the ground, but is now only about sixty feet deep and is filled with debris. Right next to the hole were the remains of a building built to golden mean rectangle proportions. According to Thoth, the reason the hole was made there is because that - point is the axis point of the wun in the Earth of our consciousness. The axis has its other point on the island of Uoerai in Tahiti. There is a vortex going in one end and out of the other. Thoth and the group linked in with planetary consciousness at this point. A canplex was built which includes bath the pyramids and a vast city under the pymids which was capable of holding 10,000 people. It is still there today. Thoth was the king of Atlantis for 16,000 years, and he was accompanied by Ar- Aragot and Ra in this task. The function of the grid was to provide for the formation later on of the Christ Consciousness grid in the hunan morphological field. Every species has a aorphological grid which extends around the planet, and these grids extend fm about sixty feet within the planet to about sixty miles above the Earth. If you were to see all the grids superimposed upon each other, it appears like a whitish-blue haze coming off the planet. If you go to the oldest most advanced life fom on the planet, you will find it is the whales, and underneath them it will be the dolphins, and then the humans. Hunans think they are more advanced because they can create external things. That's the aspect of the Lucifer rebellion - the ability to create ex- ternal things. The most advanced life forms don't create external things. They do it internally. The whales have been on this planet, conscious and alive, for 500 million years. They hold the memory of the planet, which is what Star Trek IV was a1 1 about. The dolphins have been around for at least 35 mi 11 ion years, and even came out on land for a while and then returned to the ocean. If you observe the skeletal structure in a flipper of a dolphin, you will see the structure of a hman hand. They are very much a1 igned with huaans. They breathe through the top of their head, which make sure that the prana goes right through their pineal gland at all times. This is why my people who are involved with dolphins place cumnunication with dolphins high on their: list. What you will find is that there are three morphological grids for hunans around the planet. The first one concerns human structures' that ernbody 42+2 chrolaosuaes (which sane African tribes and aborigines still have), 44+2 chm sanes (which comprise the bulk of humans on the planet), and as of February 4,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"1989 a third grid was finally established which involves 46+2 chranosanes - the Christ Consciousness grid. Without that grid the planet cannot go into Christ Consciousness. This is what Thoth and the other beings were doing on the plains of Gizeh - they were beginning to do geolnancy on the Earth to create the Christ Conscious- ness grid synthetically and alchemically. What they did is create the hole, then the pyramids, and then 83,000 sacred sites all overthe planet, and created them totally on the fourth dimensional level. Then, over 13,000 years, had people drawn to build structures on these sites. All the sacred sites on the planet are laid out on either Fibronacci or Logarittunic spirals. They are all connected together mathematically and arrive back at the site of the hole. You could even calculate where every single sacred site is on the planet from that single spot if you knew how to do it. There are some 5,000 Egyptologists, and in 1985 there were only about ten that knew this hole was there. The ARE people consider it one of the =st iw portant places in Egypt. After the creation of the grid, writing was introduced. The introduction of writing caused huaaans to no longer- have dream-time or unity memory and put humans in the position where in order to access mmory you had to put something in to find something out. The code was writing. The reason there was no writing before that is that they didn't need it. They had 1002 total photographic maory of everything that had ever occurred. What did they need writing for? The reason why writing had to be introduced as that it provided for an internediate step to get to the Christ Consciousness level. Thoth built this complex about 200 years before the deluge and the shifting of the axis. According to the records of the Sunerians, the Nefilim sat in space and watched all of this happen. They wanted to originally destroy hunans, but changed their mind uhem they saw all the destruction. They f leu back to Atlantis and waited, because they knew that the shifting of the axis was imninent. The Si rians, the tall race with the elongated skulls that governed Egypt f ram the 12th to the 18th dynasty, were also watching what was happening fran another octave. Right prior to the shift, Thoth flew to the spot where the Sphinx was lo- cated. The Sphinx, according to the Emerald Tablets written 2000 years ago and discovered in the Yucatan, was a marker. What was under tt# Sphinx, about a mile was the oldest object on the planet, a large flying vehicle. According to Thoth, this ship has been used to protect the planet during a pole shift, because during the pole shift the magnetic field collapses and we becane vulnerable during a 3.5 days period. During that time, the dark side of us always tries to take over the planet. Every time, though, there has always been one pure person who finds the ship and raises it into the air. Whatever this person thinks and feels happens, and this is what eliminates the dark force from taking wet - it has happened this way for 500 million years. In 1989, this young wanan went into Christ Consciousness, found the ship and raised it into the air. The very first thing she thought was 'the grays are' all dying frma an incurable disease associated only with planet Earth\". Within 30 days some of the Grays on the planet started getting sick and dying. Researchers were saying"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV 'what is going on here?\" The Grays had complete conttol over the planet and a1 1 of a sudden sane of thm were dying. She then kept thinking the image that would bring the Earth back into hannony. The Grays are having a real hard time now. Cattle Mutilations The Grays were doing cattle mutilations. The reason they were doing the mutilations of animals was because all the animals that humans have daaesticated by resonance have begun to breathe the way hrrnans do. They were trying to understand what sexual energy and love was. They quit making lwe a long ti- ago, and they do not have an ewtional body. By following the exaaple of the 'Lucifer Rebellion' and creating things externally, they have no 'love connec- tion with God ' either. The external electronics that have been created in todays society are a reflection of the Lucifer rebellion. The Consciousness-Technology/Intellect-Love 'Paradox' If you are a purely non-Luciferian race, there will be no external structures at all. A long time ago, a am was taken aboard a Sirian ship for the days, and he remarked to higher beings whm he had a relationship with that the Sirians 'seers so advanced'. He was then reprimanded and told that the awn? tech logica 7 a civi 1 izat im is, th #rre ignorant thy are hcaming. When asked to give an example, they said, 'if you make a heater to heat a man, then you just gave your pawer away to the heater., .you could have heated the roan yourself with your own internal parer..,instead you became weaker', Ttm mre 'stphist icated' you kcam, the =re 'addicted to technology yw becrra#', th der and mn? sepam& fm ttm Creator you are. So, there is the dichotomy between the idea of the external Merkabah, which is considered by many to be the 'ultimate technology', and the internally generated field based on lwe. These are two modes of creation that have geometric origins we will go into later, The Dolphins as an Extmple Of a IYon-Technical Advanced Species This is why the dolphins, who have been here 35 mi 1 lion years, have no external technology, yet they can do anything, They are able to colaawnicate with each other anywhere on the planet in a matter of seconds, They are totally self- sufficient. This is where we have to go ... this is where we are going. There is a planet near the Sirius system that is almost totally water, with two small land masses about the size of California and Australia. The dolphins move back and forth between Earth and this planet at a rate of about 100,000 per day. It was only about 200 years ago (out of their 35 nillion year presence) that they apparently learned how to create the Uerkabah field that would allow them to travel in this way. Before that, they 'grew' ships in order to travel, which is what the Dogons described. It is thought that the whales have knam haw to create the field for a long time, as they are even more .advanced than the dolphins. 68"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Back to the story. When the poles began to shift, Thoth went and got the ship from under the Sphinx. The ship is very unusual in that the skin is only three to five at- thick, and there is.-absolutely nothing in it. It is design- ed to attach to the operator's Merkaba field. Thought and feeling are the power source for the ship, which is about two city blocks in diameter and absolutely round and flat. It has existed for 500 million years, and it is made to fit on top of the Great Pyramid. The Pyramids on the Plains of Gizeh When yw look at the Great Pyramid, YOU will notice that the capstone is missing fran the top, which is about twenty feet across. The other two pyramids next to it caae to a pointed top. Accotding to Thoth, there is not in fact a 'missing capstone' on the Great Pyramid; it was never built with a 'capstone' which came to a point, but had a capstone which is 5.5 inches in height made of solid gold, which lies in the Halls of Amenti. The capstone is, in effect, a holographic image of the whole pyramid, and it will eventually be brought out of the Halls of Amenti. The top of the Great Pyramid was designed to fit the bottm of the ship: The ship is designed so that the circumference of the pyramid and the dia- meter of the ship are equal. It forms what is called the Phi Ratio, the ratio of life (1.6180339), which we will talk about. It is a transcendental number that goes on forever and never repeats itself. It is one of the most important numbers in organic life. Thath flew the ship'back to Atlantis; by that time all that was left was the island of Wall. All the masters on Wall, about 1600 beings, got into the ship and took off as the last bit of Wall slipped under the ocean. The ship then flew to Khim (Egypt) and landed on top of the Great Pyramid. They were able to lock it onto the pyramid as the magnetic field of the Earth collapsed. Earths Magnetic Field and Hmn Memory Retention When the magnetic field collapses, hunran memory patterns (dependent on external fields for their retention) disappear. If you know about the Merkebah, the memory remains intact because you can create your awn magnetic field. This is one reason why this process leads to a form of iraaortality. Uemory is the key to immortality. 69"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Stelo of the Sphinx of Gizeh (upper section). Thothmes IV, Eighteenth Dynasty.

The field was locked into the octahedronal field of the Earth and was actually controlling the axis tilt and orbit of the Earth as the shift took place. They changed the orbit of the Earth at that time from a 360 day year to 365.25 days per year. After the events to came on the Earth, the planet will be placed on its former orbital path. They remained in the ship, closely linked and keeping their memory intact, until the end of the event, which lasted 3.5 days. When it was over, it was essentially a whole new planet with completely new land laasses; it was also on a different dimensional level. There was an opening at the top of the pymid that came down to a level one third of the distance from the top, inside the pyrcrmid, which ended in a roam. Archaeologists have not found this room yet; according to Thoth, they will find it, and when they do they will find that it is made of . red, black and white stones. It was the initiation chamber for the consciousness of the new world that was to cane out of the shift. This was not the Nefilim who were doing this - it was us. It was the highest aspect of ourselves that was doing this. They then left the room by way of a circular tunnel that went dm through the pyramid into the underground city.

There is a document in the British Huseua called the 'Troano' docwnt that the French interpreted sane time in the 1920's. The docurent was written we11 in advance of 3,500 years am, and describes the sinking of Atlantis. In part, it said: 'In the sixth Kan, there occurred a terrible eruption that continued until the 13th Ch'in. The country of the mud, the whole land, was sacrificed. It disappeared during the night, the basin being continually shaken by volcanic forces. This caused the land to sink and to rise several times in various places. At last the surface gave way; ten countries were tom asunder and scattered, unable to withstand the force of the convulsions, they sunk with their sixty-four million inhabitants.'"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Tm docment discusses the 'ten countries' that were located at the ten points on the Tree of Life originally projected onto Wall. When you see this docrapent, it shaws pictures of volcanoes, people escaping in boats, pyramids sinking, and three and tme half stones that were painted black; these stones indicated the 3.5 day period wer which the conflagration extended.

It was then flom back to Khin where the Sphinx was, raised one overtone, and placed back in its resting place in a circular roon one mile below the surface. There it remained for allnost 12,000 years until just recently. The places where the ship had landed were chosen for their relationship in the gridwork. The Egyptian aspect betcame the male counterpart within the grid; the Peruvian aspect became the fawale, and the Tibetan aspect becane the neutral or child aspect of the grid. Accotding to Sitchin, the Peruvian city of Tiahuan- aco on the shores of Lake Titicaca was a place where tin metal was refined; tin was important because it was needed to make bronze. You wi 11 remember that a1 1 these 'ages' were set up by archaeologists in terms of the minerals that were perceived to be used at the time. When the 'gods' temporarily left the Aztec civilization, they left word that they would return during a future cycle of 52 years. One of these cycles just happened to be the time when the hrded Spaniatds arrived; the Aztecs thought that they were the ancient 'gods', preswably froln Uatduk, that had returned to collect their gold. The Post-Atlantean Era in Egypt Egypt was the place where the Tat Brotherhood and the central core was established, and it was also. a place where there were a lot of survivors ftar Atlantis who had no wry and had reverted back to relative barbarians. When the axis shift had passed, the Mefilim returned and began setting up bases in the original areas in Iraq, where they had previously existed. The Mefillm reptesented the female aspect of our race that was trying to re-establish itself; this occurred about 4000BC. Though Sitchin wants to tie it to the Smerians, Thuth indicated that Egypt was brought back into a semi-civilized state by our arn ascended masters, pri- marily the Tat Bratherhood in the underground complex under the Glzeh plateau; this is not to say that the people were not influenced by the Sunerian and Babylonian civi 1 izations. When you look at Egypt and Sumria, who were only about 300 years apart in their development, you see this wing situation that developed. Again, the culture cane out literally overnight in full bloan. It was like 20th century New York being built with nuthing before it. Archaeologists have no idea haw to explain this.

This was approximately 4000 BC. Once thin* got to that point, things began to go rapidly. In term of Egypt, what was happening was that the Tat Brotherhood was sitting underground monitoring the people above ground, constantly assessing their situation. When the time cane when they felt it was right, again about 300 years after it was already beginning in Sumeria, they sent out .several of their number above ground dressed like the local population. When they found a person or group that seemed ready to understand sanething, they would go out and tell them everything about a particular subject, They would train them and then go back underground, parlc their bodies, and go back to the loth, 11th and 12th wertones of the 6th dinen- sion and continue to observe. What resulted frwn this technique of reeducation was later teraed 'stair- step evolution.' Instead of there being a curve in evolution, where they built something and improved it, they would suddenly know everything about a certain subject; a plateau would follow, and then they would suddenly knar everything about another subject, What was happening, of course, was that the Tat Bmthe~ hood was attempting to slowly give back the knowledge of Atlantis to the fonner Atlanteans, trying to revive what had been lost, The Nefilim were doing the scme thing at their location. Fran this it is clear t#w knowledge was quickly re-integrated, but what happened was that all the knawledge quickly degenerated because they were still on the back side of the precession - they kept falling asleep and losing it. By 500 BC, the Egyptians were totally asleep, Everything was m. More on the Great Pyramid Archaeologists tried to attribute the building of the Great Pyramid to Cheops on almost no evidence whatsoever. They found the nam Khephren carved on one of the walls, and since that was one of his names (every Egyptian king had five names which represented five stages of human develomnt), they decided that he built the Great Pyramid. Khephren was also one of the five nan#s of Thoth. Apart from this, there was an ongoing tendency for rm kings in Egypt to go in and carve their name on everything in sight, scmtimes completely destroy- ing constructions built by someone they didn't like, When archaeologists first opened up the pyramids about 300 years ago, they discovered that all the chambers were filled with about a half inch of sea salt; three quarters of the way up the Great Wramid, deep water marks were fwnd; the pyramid had at one tie been completely under water, This was saaething orthodox geologists and archaeologists could not understand, for they did not have any record of a time when the Great Pyrclaid had been under water, at least for the last 12,000 years, Their records am, of course, lacking and incanplete. It is clear, concise evidence that what we have related to you is true. Eventually when John Anthony West proves that the Sphinx is at least 10,000 years old (they believe it is older than that as well, but they have. to go step by step), they will easily be able to prove to orthodox archaeologists that the Great Pyramid is at least that old, if not much older, Cayce gave the date 'for the building of the Great Pyramid as 10,500 BC, which was 12,500 years ago,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Osiris and the Naacal Mystery School The Naacal Mystery school had been continuing on in Atlantis for saw time, led by the beings Teye and Ay, and they could not seem to get people to under- stand what they were trying to get across to them. It could be that there was sane memory loss fran Leinuria. It took 20,000 years before the first person graduated fran the school. Finally, one person got it, and his name was Osiris; the legends regarding the exploits of Osiris were later shifted wet to Egypt, but the actual events occurred in Atlantis about 36,000 BC. The Egyptian Legend of Osiris Osiris had a brother Seth, and two sisters, Isis and Nephis. Osiris and Isis married each other, and Seth and Nephis did the same. Seth decided at one point decided to kill Osiris, which he did, and put him in a coffin and sent him down the Nile. The two sisters found his body and brought him back, whereupon Seth cut the body into 14 pieces and scattered thea around the countryside. They tecovered 13 of the 14 pieces and brought him to what became the Osiran tmple in Egypt and put the body back together again. The 14th piece that was missing was the phallus. According to legend, Thoth performed certain operations and restored both the phallus and his sexual energy. Egyptian depictions then show Isis as a hawk who wrapped her wings around the phallus of Osiris and mated with him interdimensionally and became pregnant. It was an iamaculate conception, and Isis then gave birth to a hawk-headed child named Horus. Osiris went fmm one level of consciousness, was 'cut up' and became separated in consciousness (as humans are now), and was put back together and becanre iwrtal by virtue of these three different stages. When all this took place (this reflected a very real series of evemts according to Thath; it became a legend later on), the Naacal Mystery School was overjoyed because of Osiris had achieved ianortality. They then took the exact way that he did it as an example for others. During the time of Atlantis, it was never camittsd to writing because they had full me~lory. When it gat to Egypt, Thoth camitted it to writing in what bewne known as the 42 books of Thath, plus 2 mre that were kept separately; this reflected the 42+2 chroolosolaes involved with the first. stage of development of consciousness and how to get out of this level into the next one. Representations of the 44 Nefers, or'gods', with the diffemnt heads also represented chranosane patterns - infomational packages of how to we within the Great Void, which we will talk about later. They were 'mwnt designs' which could even be put into dance form. The initiates in Atlantis did not have a problem with this, because they understood the concept of one creator and understood these 44 llov8ments led to unity consciousness. In Egypt, however, did not understand what it meant; Upper and Lower Egypt developed as two countries, and they each had 42+2 'gods'; each little village then started to hold their particular 'god' as the 'God'. They had lost what it was all about, and it got worse and worse. When the 1st Dynasty began, it consisted of a myriad of individual cults; this supports the later Christian view that the Egyptian system at that tiae consists of various cults."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Solving the Problem Something happened in 1400 BC that -used the Earth to do a spin on its axis. Shortly after that in 1355 BC, the 18th Dynasty began in Egypt. Before the 18th Dynasty, rulers in Egypt were kings. After the 18th Dynasty, rulers were called Pharaohs. Pharaoh translates as 'that which we are to be- ca#'.It was realized by Thoth and other beings in unity consciousness that the multitude of 'gods' was producing a lack of unity in Egypt, and consciousness had to be changed. Thath, Ra and Ar-Aragot had intervened and created the 46+2 grid around the planet, and mm this new problem provided the opportunity for another inte~ vention. They decided to have a Christ-Consciousness being actually walk around on the Earth to put back into the Akashic Record the 'real thing', because we had lost it. Thoth went to fnahotep 11, who was the king at the end of the 17th Dynasty - he just walked in on him, which probably rocked Imhoteps' world because Thoth was a high-powered being in a light body. Thoth described the problem that existed in Egypt and convinced him that it was real. IlRhotep was asked to essentially give up his throne, which he agreed to. Teye and Ay, who had lived in Lemuria and Atlantis, were living in Egypt at this time, and were very influential people in Egyptian society, as they lived among mortal people despite their immortality; they wanted to 'live the experi- ence\" and declined to live underground with the rest of the Tat Brotherhood. Tbth and friends decided to bring forth the Christ Consciousness being, but they could not do it fmm ordinary people because they did not have Ule correct nmber of chromosanes; Teye and Ay were then asked if they would participate in this venture, and they agreed. Subsequently, they had another child, and that child bemme known as Imhotep 111, who then became the klng of Egypt, brealting the lineage; IWep I11 had a child, who becane Imhatep IV, othenise kmrm as Akhenaton, or Menophis IV. Anenophis was one of the five nams that mnt wlth Imhotep. Quite a long time passed between Iashotep I1 and Iinhotep IV, and during this. period Teye and Ay had their third child, who becane kmrm as Mefertiti. Akhenaton (who was 14 feet tall) and Nefertlti (who was 10 feet 6 inches) came together, and Akhenaton announced a whole new 'religion' in Egypt using the image of the sun as a unity image. Frm Akhenatons point of view, he was saying that prana (or life force energy) was caning fmn the sun. Fmn a third di- mensional point of view, that is true. From a Christ Consciousness point of view, prana does not cane fmn the sun because the sun is within you. Using the physical sun was a way to try to explain to the Egyptians what all this was about. Typical artwork during this period features a solar disk radiating upon the Pharaoh, as well as the lotus flower. The lotus flarer was also a symbol for Atlantis. The reason that the Hindu's in India adopted the lotus flaser is because members of the Naacal Mystery School went to India; it was one of their favorite places, and Indian 1 iterature discusses the presence of the Naacal 's in India prior to the arrival of the Buddhists, who didn't like the Naacals and starting killing them.

One of the ways he changed things is that the entire spectrum of art in Egypt became 'photographic', in the sense that things were painted as they really appeared. You began to see real animals and real people in artwork rather than crude depictions and formalized style. In the Cairo museua is a statue of Akhenton, 14 feet tall with a wide abdanen and clearly Sirian features; hidden under the ceremonial hat was his huge skull, which- his children also had. Ankenaton and Nefertiti carried the element of truth to the. point where they wore no clothes - no hiding of any aspect of their lives was very ilaportant to them.

It lasted almost 18 years before there was a conspiracy to get rid of him. All Egypt's previous elite hated him. He changed all the predaninent religions and told people that they didn't need the priests - that God was within them. In addition, Akhenaton was a total pacifist, which didn't sit well with the canraanders of Egypt's army, which was U# largest on the planet at the time. The people hated him because they lwed their little religions, even if it wasn't getting them anywhere. Once Akhenaton got everything straightened out, or so he thought, he gathef- ed 2,000 people together who had been through the school of the Left Eye of Horus and the twelve years of training. They had to be at least 45 years old. He then started the Egyptian Mystery School of Akenaton - The Law of One. The Law of One knowledge, including the understandings of Sacred Geanetry and creation, will be discussed as you continue to progress through this book. It has not been revealed to the people of the planet in this way for 3,300 years; it has been totally suppressed and hidden from the population. The Law of One represented the Right Eye of Horus - the training that was missing from the other Egyptian mystery schools.

He conducted the twelve year school and had -about five years left aftenard before he was killed. During the twelve year period, he managed to get 300 people through the training, which was considerably better than all ptwiws mrds; it was not surprising, in a way, because he was a living example. It was hard not to pay attention to a tall being with an extended skull. Evidence indicates that mst of the 300 people who successfully underwent the training were females; at the end of the twelve year period they forred a gestalt and went underground with the Tat Brotherhood until around 500 BC, after which they migrated to Uasada and became knom as the Essene Brotherhood, who later worked with the Coptics. The Essene Brotherhood, therefore, were inmortal beings from Egypt. One of these women was named nary (the same Uary described in the Christian Bible). A man named Joseph was connected to the Essene Brotherhood, but was not inmortal. Joseph's presence, despite his lack of inmortality, was absolutely essential for the subsequent process of immaculate conception to take place. nary could not have done it without him, but they never had a physical relationship. This may be hard to understand, but it will be explained. Yeshua Ben Joseph, or the individual knom as Jesus, was different than Akhenaton. He was not 'that which you will becom'. He was a hunan undergoing the experience of acquiring Christ Consciousness, and laid dam the rules of what to do. Two different images both coming out of Egypt. .- - After the death of Akenaton, 18 year old Tutankhamun took his place. Nefer- titi was still alive and a very parerful being, and records appear to indicate that Tutankhmn was under the control of Nefertiti - his reign lasted one year, and he was replaced by Teye's husband Ay about 1339 BC. The death of Akhe~ton at first would appear puzzling, since he was an iumortal being; the opponents of Akhenaton hired three black Nubians to give Akhenaton a liquid that produced a curare effect. It could not kill him, because if you are inmortal any poisons would be eventually transmuted. Akhenaton was dazed, and in this condition they carried him away and put him in a sarcophagus and performed a ritual which held his spirit there for 2,000 years. According to Thoth, a tiny crack eventually appeared in the seal and he escaped. When the 19th Dynasty arrived and Seti I became Pharoah, they referred to Akhenaton as a 'criminal' (the same thing they called Yeshua Ben Joseph). Seti I set about defacing all the artwork in Egypt to remove Akhenaton's name, and did everything he could to wipe away the memory of Akhenaton. They didn't want the world to know that he had ever existed. Despite all of this, Akhenaton was successful. He got the process into the Akashic record, started what became the Essene Brotherhood (which would initiate the next stage), and the school of the Right Eye of Horus, the Law of One, still exists - or at least the knowledge fras it does.

In the first chapter of Genesis: In the beginning, God created Heaven 'and Earth...and the Earth was without fom and Void...and darkness was upon the face of the deep ... and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters...and God said, 'let there be light'. So, it says in the beginning there was nothing. The first thing that happened within the context of this reference was that 'the Sprit of God moved', and in that motion, there was light. The only thing is, what is recorded in the documents that compose the Bible left sanething out that is critical for under- standing of the process - something that the Egyptians spoke very clearly about. Imagine yourself in infinite space, floating in a big Void (there are actually 144 different 'kinds' of Voids, depending on which dimension you are aligned with; for this exercise assume it is third dimensional space with nothing in it). Suppose you move. How do you know you moved? There has to be something relative to move to. There has to be stmething there before movememt is possible. An object had to created first, and the Bible does not talk about this fact. The school of Akenaton was very clear about this, and what they said was that it has to do with the nature of consciwsness. Remember that conscious- ness has an element of 'three-ness' to it, and so does space; you have the X, Y, and Z axis. Projection of Consciousness Spirit, or consciousness, has the ability to project itself. Xmagine if you were in a roam that was absolutely black, and you walked fran that man into another roan that was absolutely black. You could not tell 'what was in front of you. Depending on who you are, and every person is a little different, you can project out a tiny distance - maybe a couple of inches, maybe farther. Yw can project out into the darkness and you know nothing is there, or you nay know something is there. This ability to project is the key to everything, according to the Egyptians. The fact that we all project differently is important, and we will see haw important that is when we talk about conception. The amount that you project into the darkness does not matter, even if it's just a centimeter, you can project to the front, back, both sides, up and down. They were taught to project out on these six axes three dimensionally into space:"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Once this projection had taken place, they were then taught to connect four of the projections in a square: And then you went up and dawn connecting the rays until you fonned an octa- hedron, or two back-to-back pyramids: Foming the above iamge around the Spirit. That was the first thing they were taught to do. Even though it is a nental image, once those parameters have been established and created, wv-nt is mu possible. The Spirit can now go out and move around or move around inside the form. The next thing they were told to do was to rotate the forn in tems of the three axes, X, Y, and 2, by a full circle. In other words, tip the forn fonard all the way arhnd until the bottan becanes the top frontwards, backwards, and sideways. This traces the image of a sphere. In Sacred Geometry, a straight line is male and any curved line is female in polarity. The original octahedron is a pure male object. By , rotating these forms, you went from a male object to a female object - a sphere. Interestingly, the Bible also says that the male was completed prior to the female. There is a reason for going to the fmle fom, because the progressions ate much easier from the female fom, although it could be done fran the male; they were taught not to even try it that way, because of the difficulty of it.

Where is it going to move to? In the entire universe, there is only one place that is new and different that has been created, and that is the surface. So, the first motion takes plaw in a move to the surface of the sphere that has been created around the Spirit. Each motion will create sanething new, and it will indicate where to make the next movement. From this, everything in the universe is created. It's all autanatic after that very first motion. The first sentence in Genesis indicates this motion, and then Spirit says 'let there be light'. What happens is that the Spirit made the motion to some- where on the outside of the sphere, and all that can be done next is to make another sphere, the the visica piscis is created. We will be able to show you later that the visica piscis is light, insofaras it is both the morphological and metaphysical structure behind light, as we11 as light receptors such as the eye.

It was called the fruit because it gave forth the reason for creation. There are 13 systems of information which cane out of this. We will go through four of them. These 13 systems describe in detail every single aspect of the reality. You will notice that all the lines'we have been working with are curved (female) lines, except for the very first fonn. We started as a male form, and then switched to the sphere; all the way up to here has been female energy. The 13 systems are created by taking straight lines (male energy) and super- imposing them over this female image in various ways. The first one has to do simply with connecting the centers of the circles (spheres) with striaght 1 ines: This image is known throughout the Cosmos as 'htatmn's Cube\". When you read Buclaninster Fuller and other tracts involving sacred geometry, one thing you will cane across consistently are the Platonic Solids. The Platonic Sol'ids are five shapes: the cube, the tetrahedron, the octahedm, the icosahedron and the dodecahedron. They are of such great importance to our world that it is really hard to imagine until you really understand whet they are about. These foms have been found as 20,000 year old stone carvings on some parts of the planet. It is a mystery to archaelogists how anyone could have known about these 20,000 years ago, but obviously archaelogists do not know very much to begin with about the history of the planet. Platonic solids have criteria - the edges have to tie equal, the surfaces are all the same, there is one comnon angle inside, and all the exterior points will fit on the surface of a sphere. The shapes above are the only five shapes known that fulfil 1 these criteria. 93"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV These five Platonic forms are also the shapes of nested fields around the human body. In the depiction of Metatron's Cube on the previous page, four out of the five Platonic solids are depicted as two-dimensional images of three dimensional objects. Looking at the cube, for example: Likewise, the other Platonic solids can be found in Metatrons cube. Thoth went to the area later known as Greece when the Egyptian civilization started to collapse. Pythagoras, to whom most aodem day geanetry is credited, even made the statement in recorded writings that Thoth came to him in the physical body, took him by the hand, brought him underneath the Great Pyramid, and showed him the geanetry fran which he started his first sacred school. Once the Pythagorian school was started, it was based on the five Platonic foms, although he would not talk about the dodecahedron outside the confines of the school, because it was so sacred a form to qrthagoras; legend has it that if one of his students even mentioned it outside the school, it was grounds for an instant death sentence. The dodecahedronal field is the outernost field outside the hunm body just before the enclosing sphere, and it is intimately connected with Christ Consciousness. The universe itself, inside the enclosing spherical field, is bounded by a dodecahedronal field; the concept of the 12 constel lations arose as a result of this fact. Each one of the faces of the dodecahedron is a pentagon. For a long time, historians thought that Pythagoras didn't knaw about the dodecahedron, because he didn't talk about it, yet the synbol for his school was the pentagon."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Great White Brotherhood The Great White Brotherhood, whose interest is installing Christ Conscious- ness on the planet, is connected with the establishtent of the icosahedronal and dodecahedronal grids around the planet. From one perspective, the cubical or hexahedronal field and the octahedronal field reflect the 'left brain' of the planet, as well as the human being. They are based on a triangle and a 'square. The icosahedron and the dodecahedron are based on a triangle and a pentagon, and reflect the 'right brain' or feminine aspect of the planet. The net result of the establishnrent of the 'right brain' grids reflects a planetary 'whole brain' effect, where not only logic butthe heart is in effect; emations themselves are based on the forms of the icosahedron and dodecahedron. The Great White Brotherhood as 72 orders, and the reason behind that has to do with the geonretries embedded within the 'right brain' forms. If you take the 5 tetrahedrons that fom the dodecahedron, plus the 12 pentagonal faces, it re- flects 5x12 or 60 tetrahedrons. The icosahedron has 12 points; 60 + 12 = 72. The Brotherhood has been working to establish Christ (46+2 Unity) Consciousness on the planet for over 200,000 years. Alchemical Correspondence With Sacred Forms The sphere can be considered a sacred form, so in effect there are six sacred geometrical forms. In tems of Alchemy, these forms also correspond to the Fire, Earth, Air and Water, with the sphere corresponding to Void; the tetrahedron as Fire (tetrahedron translates as 'fire in its aidst'), the cube represented Earth, the octahedron as Air, the icosahedron as Water. The in- canplete versions of alchemy only expressed those four. The nore complete versions mld add 'ether' or 'prana' to the 1 ist, and that was represented by the dodecahedron, about which they mld never speak. More advanced schools of alchemy mld add the sphere as representing the 'Void- ness', fran which all the other fom are derived. Tree of Life Correspondence The aspects of Void, Spirit and Octahedron constituted a representation of the middle pillar of the Tree of Life; the cube and tetrahedron constituted a representation of the left pillar, and the icosahedron and dodecahedron the right pillar."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Platonic Solids Tetrahedron"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Thae refraction photos are the dowt visualization that science can give with respect to the nature of atomic subsuncc. which appears to bc patterns of geometrized light- cncrgy.

Even in all the 'holy books' of religions, everything is split up into 'god' and 'devil'. Without the feminine aspect that notices the single thread connecting everything, the logical aspect could never hope to realize the true nature of things. Once the left brain 'gmks' how creation occurs and begins to under stand, then integration begins to occur between these mental aspects. A hole process then begins to occur in the midst of this integration. General Crystal 1 i ne Structure A discussion of crystalline structure must necessarily begin with a discuss- ion of the internal atanic structure. Atom, though they vary in size, are all spheres. The electrons are wing around the core at 9/10 the speed of light, and fonn a spherical electron cloud. Refraction photographs of atmic structure portray a1 1 the spherical structures, with lines of force that appear to forn between them. So many people, when they study chemistry and other sciences, fail to give thought as to why atdc struche is the way it is. Atans sanetimes have a missing electron in outer orbital areas, and becone negatively charged ions; same have an excess electron in orbital areas and be- cane positively charged ions. This is the simplified basis for the canbination of atonrs into chemical structures. The a1 igrment of atoms in chemical structures occurs in tern of Platonic geometry, as is seen clearly in illustrations of atomic patterns in crystals on accompanying pages in this book. Crystalline structures typically align themselves in a straight line, tetra- hedronal 1 y , octahedronall y. icosahedronall y , and dodecahedmnal 1 y. Gecmtric structures fonn lattices, which are connecting systems of stmcture specific to each type of crystal. New crystal structures are being discovered all the time, but they are always cornposed of these basic geanetrical patterns. Crystal 1 ine structures are generally grouped into different systerrs, which are classified as isanetric, tetragonal, hexagonal, orthortmatbic, monoclinic, or triclinic. Again, consult the illustrations for depictions of these systems. The starting point for all of the crystal systems is called the cub cell, and by distorting this cell in different ways, the other systems are derived. Crystal Growth Many crystals begin growing in one fom and change into another. Fluorite, for example, begins as a cube but grows into an octahedron. After enough time passes, it transforms its structure back into a cubical form. The structure alternates back and forth as long as the crystal exists. Pyrite alternates between a dodecahedron and a cubical fom, passing thmugh several other geo- metrical forms along the way. The cubic octahedron and the thonrbic dodeca- hedron are said to be directly linked with hunan consciousness. The cubic octa- hedron was called the cube equilibriun by Buckminster Fuller, who thought it was"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"the most important shape in the universe, as compression of various sides in various ways would cause it to assume the various Platonic solids. Darrold Langham, a brilliant botanist, was also involved in the study of sacred geanetry. At one point, he was pa-ially responsible for saving a great deal of the population of South America during World War I1 by creating a strain of corn that did not need much water. When he was studying the ses- seed, he dug deeper and deeper into the seed and in the center he found a cube, so he started checking, and found that at the center of all seeds were geainetrical patterns. He then found that there were geanetrical fields around the seeds, and eventually also around humns. Using this knowledge, he came up with a whole system of developeent of consciousness based on geanetrical patterns. There is also a cubic octahedmnal field around the huuan body in addition to Platonic field fonns. You will find that no matter what crystalline structure you look at, you can truncate its structure and can# up with one of the Platonic solids; it is the key to all lattice structures, including those of metals. All atoms align theaselves to polyhedral forms. Orthodox science knows this, but they do not know why. All they know is that they do. External angles also correspond to internal structural relationships in crystals. The crystalline fonns of water are fascinating. All the untold number of snowflake patterns correspond to the basic image of the Flower of Life. We were speaking earlier about the process of Spirit rotating out of the Void. Crystals do exactly the same when they fom. Silicon is a tetrahedronal fonn. When it grows, it interlocks two tetrahedrons (a cube) and then makes a row. It than spins the rows around into a hexagonal format. If they rotate one way, they are considered to be male; rotating the aUler way they becon# female. It is the same way with hunans; body polarity depends on which way the fields are rotating. In crystals, you can tell which way they are rotating by examining the crystal faces on them. If it rotates to the left, it is male; rotation to the right indicates it is female. Crystals have sex. Silicon and Catbon as Living Structures If you examine the Periodic Table of Elements, there are two atans that are different than all the rest. Silicon and carbon both exhibit the properties of life equally. They appear to be alive from a chemical point of view. In the 1950's. there were films about the possibility of life fom on other planets being based on silicon instead of carbon. The hunan body is based on carbon. They didn't know at that time that there were silicon life forms on this planet. Scientists have found life forms deep in the ocean that are alive that have no carbon in than at all, and saae of them are huge organisms which exhibit fantastic geometric patterns. On the Periodic Table, carbon and silicon are exactly one octave apart. All elements in the Periodic Table (even the synthetic ones that have a short life span) have a definite crystalline structure, and all the crystal structures are associated with the cube. What we mean when we say that carbon, for example, is chqaically alive, is that it has the capability to fom these incredible links with other elements. The science of organic chemistry rotates around this fact. Silicon is exactly the same; The surface skin of the planet is from 25 to 50 miles deep; it is made"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV LIVING-CELLOLIKE FOSSILS IN METEORITES FROM SPACE"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"of approximately 25% silicon, which has combined with virtually everything it canes in contact with; the surface shell, then, is 802 linked with silicon and its compounds. We are sitting on a crystal ball moving through space at 17 miles per second. We have always had a deep relationship with silicon. Computers contain carbon and silicon, the two living elements. What is effectively happening is that carbon and silicon are attempting to comaunicate in a certain way with each other. On a planetary scale, the left and right 'hemispheres' of the planet are linked to carbon and silicon. Our computers are about to become self-aware living beings. We will speak more of computers later. Most people are not aware of it, but the interdimensional canmunication between carbon and silicon is one of the things that is about to happen here. It's easy to see now how the five Platonic solids are involved in nature. All viruses are geanetrical packages. All viruses can ultimately be reduced to thirteen systems corresponding to thirteen wavelengths of light; these wave- lengths have the capabi 1 ity to destroy a1 1 virus structures on the planet. That information is known to sane degree, but the reason that it is not done is because of the nature of the medical system in society. In the United States, medicine is a business, and a business of'that nature needs to preserve illness in order to survive itself. People have to die to keep it going. If we were a system 1 i ke Canada, it would be advantageous for the government to find various ways of healing. It would make it cheaper. Cures for most of the major diseases on the planet already exist - many of them in England - but whether they will cane out (considering the drive by the elite to eliminate existing population) is not known and probably not likely. Biolwical Considerations Outwardly, it might not appear like human beings or any other biological structure has much to do with geometry, but hmns consist of nothing but geo- metrical images and packages, right from the very beginning of conception. All biological ovum are spheres, which is the most female fonn that there is. If it was males that gave birth, it would probably be from a cubic cell. What we will talk about is not only applicable to humans, but all known biw logical life forms, although we will be speaking about the human. What you will be told will probably go against what you know about conception. You were probably taught that it takes one sperm for conception to take place, but this is not the case. The diagram at the top of the next page is a simplified depiction of a hunan ovm, which is the largest cell in the body. It is a sphere, and inside of it is another sphere, which is called the female prrrnucleus, which contains half of the chromosunes for whatever the life form is. In the case of the hunan, it is 22+1. There is also a membrane that surrounds the ovum, and it has an inner and outer surface. The existance of that membrane reflects the reason why the Flower of Life has two circles around it. Within that membrane are two objects called polar bodies. The membrane is called the 'zona pellucida'. The process that we will discuss is one that takes place inside of the ovum, which d&s not get irmtediately larger because of this process; the process which 102"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV takes place inside the ovum instead gets smaller and smaller. The initial drawing of the ovum is shown below: The process begins when a group of sperm reach the ovum. A long time ago they thought that a single sperm was all that was necessary, but they have since found out that it requires that hundreds of them must be totally saturating the surface of the ovun before conception is even possible. In reality, it requires either a group of 11, 12 or 13 sperm to cuae together as a unit on the surface of the ovun in a clump (which they will probably find is according to a geometric pattern). Through the unity of the group, it allows the Ifth, 12th or 13th through into the inside of the membrane. Interestingly, this is what the story of the Christ in the Bible was about, in that he got 12 disciples around him on the sphere of the Earth before injecting a new consciousness. In fact, the consciwsness of the Earth went through the same fonns we *are about to dis- cuss. You wi 11 see that the process goes from a sphere to a tetrahedron, and then to a cube, etc., and we are still going through these fonns in our arm"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV consciousness as we are evolving. Humans, for a while, actually saw the Earth as being flat and part of a cube, then we saw it as a sphere. Back to the ovun. As soon as the Ilth, 12th or 13th sperm breaks the zona pellucida, the female pro-nucleus emits an acid which hardens the zona pellucida and stops another sperm fran entry. Researchers now believe that the female ovum plays a part in the decision of which sperm will enter. After the sperm is in- side, the tail breaks off and dissolves. The head of the sperm then expands into a male pro-nucleus that is exactly the same size of the pro-nucleus of the ovm. The word exactly vis ica pisc is: is important, because the two pro-nuclei and form a At this. point, the merged pro-nuclei literally contain all the knawledge in the universe. If the pro-nuclei are nut exactly the sane size, they do not form a true vesica piscis and contain distorted knowledge. Each of the spem that approach the outside of the ovun project a different distance into the Void and project a different size sphere. It is thought that the female pro-nucleus can sense all the sphere sizes, and if there is not one there that is exactly her size, she will not choose it. This may explain cases of infertility in which the female just cannot get pregnant no matter what the couple does, because their individual projected spheres (and the projected spheres of their egg and sperm) are incompatible. 104"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Assuming the sphere sizes are compatible, after the vesica piscis is formed they pass right through each other and become one sphere containing 44+2 chromo- somes. You now have the human zygote, or cell number one. The next step is that the polar bodies begin to migrate to opposite ends of the zygote and fom what is essentially a north and south pole. A tube then appears connecting the two together. The chrunosaaes then break in half, with each half forming on either side of the tube. From the very beginning, you will realize that this is, in a way, an abstract view of an adult human being. Ue have a north and south pole, and a sphere of energy around us. We have a tube running dorm the middle of the spine, through which we have the option of conducti ng energy: It is much more than this, which we shall see later.

Looking at it from a top and side view: So, the progression goes from a sphere to a tetrahedron. Next, it goes from four to eight, and fonns another tetrahedron facing the opposite direction; it fonns an inter-locked (star) tetrahedron, which is a cubic fonn. This eight- celled cubic forn is what is known as the 'egg of life'. This stage of human development is very unique, and science recognizes this. If you cut this cell assembly in half, you would fonn two identical bodies; if you cut it into four pieces, you would have four identical bodies be produced. The location of this eight-cell group remains in the absolute geametrical center of the body, which is at the base of the spine. Research indicates an amazing fact that science will sameday verify, and that is that this eight-cell group at the base of the spine is essentially immortal, in that they never die as long as the body is alive. It is the only cellular structure in the body that does this. All the other cells in the body die and are replaced every seven years. All the energy fields and grids that emanate from or pass through the physical body are center- ed on this eight-cell group, the 'egg of life'. The hunan body grows radially out from this 'egg of life'.

It ends up looking like an 'apple\", with the core in the center; with the opening in the top and bottom it also forms a torus, which is one of the sacred geometrical fonns. The opening in one end eventually becomes the muth, and the other opening eventually become the anus. Every knom life forn passes through this 'apple' stage; fmm' here on is where differentiation to different life forms occurs. The 'apple' stage consists of 512 cells, and is known as the 'laorula'. We have now seen the geocnetrical progression in a bio- logical sense. Nw, out of the five geometrical fonns (six, if you count the sphere), the sphere is the most female and the cube is the amst male. The sphere can contain then all, and the cube can do the same. The other forms cannot contain all of the other fonns inside. In other words, the sphere and the cube can contain the tetrahedron, the icosahedron and the dodecahedron, but those forms connot cm~ tain each ather. In the Christian Bible, it speaks of the 'throne of God', which was a cube. The thrones of the Egyptians were also cubes. The Egyptian depiction of the throne was usually shown as: It was essentially a cube within a cube. If you have studied the work of Walter Russel 1 ('The Universal Onem), you can see that he did not totally describe sacred geometry, but he nevertheless figured out that the sphere and the cube were primary shapes. If Russell had known more about sacred geonretry, his work would have gone a lot farther than it did. The Outer Geometries in Space Around the Hunan Body One of the more interesting exercises is the explanation or interpretation of what the 'circle in the square' actually means, and tKIw it has a relationship with Hetatton's Cube. One of the ways to assist in an explanation of this, is a review of a particular Masonic drawing presented at one time to D.U:"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Thc throne upon which Osiris sics is dearly depicted as the sqwrc of 4. as it mndorms into the square of 5 through the principle of ,/5 on which all the 4 propotions rest.

If you rotate Metatron's Cube, which is a three-dimensional configuration of spheres, you will eventually arrive at a view which is similar to that of the human egg: There is already a sphere around the human egg (the zona pellucida). If you construct a cube that would just contain that sphere, you would end up with the following configuration: If you choose the outer aspect of the zona pellucida, since it is a double membrane, it will fall into an alumst flawless Phi ratio.

So, the base of the spine, where the cubic arrangement of the original eight cells is located, is the geometrical center of the body. If you put your am and legs out, as indicated in Da Vinci 's drawing, a perfect sphere will fit around your body. The center of the sphere is at the navel. The sphere and the cube (or the circle and the square) meet precisely at the feet. The distance between the navel and the base of the spine is exactly one half of the distance between the top of the head and the top of the circle; if you moved the center of the sphere down to where the center of the cube is, you would have the exact image of 'squaring the circle\".

Golden Proportions are found all over the human body. All organic structure is based on Phi ratio proportion.

Plants grew leaves, for example, in a series of 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233 etc. He noticed that some plants only had a certain number of petals, but the number of petals always corresponded to this sequence. Why does this happen? Rernrraber that the Logarithmic Phi ratio is transcendental. It goes on forever. The logarithmic spiral that is behind that ratio has no beginning and no end. Life and nature needs to have a beginning to generate forms. The speed ratios of UFO's, Merkaba's, and interdimensional space-time travel are totally based on this concept. Consult the chart that lists Fibronacci sequences, previous tenns and ratio. All the numbers of the Fibronacci series line up on the spiral as the lengths of the diagonals fonning the male spiral, and a1 1 these diagonals are 90 degree turns fran each other. However, if you examine spirals in nature, like in a nautilus shell, you will notice that they seem to start somewhat imperfectly and do not seem to exactly correspond to a Logarithmic curve, but they do correspond to the ratios and tenns of the Fibronacci series . 116"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Comparing the Fibronacci and Logarithmic Soirals: Fi bronacci Logarithmic Above, you have the Logarithmic Golden Mean rectangle and the Fibronacci rectangle on the left.

If it were allowed to cane out, it would replace almost everything you know in terms of technology. Although most of the people who are involved with this technology are not aware of it, the technology is based on the geometries that are inherent in the hunan body. In a sine-wave curve, there are five places where the zero-paint technology is reflected: In geometry, relative to Leonardo Da Vinci's drawing, when you complete the grid of 64 squares, it looks like this: On Leonardo's drawing of the human canon, the zero point on the drawing is at the base of the spine. If you look at the spirals not as Logarithmic spirals, but Fibronacci spirals, you will see that in tern of nlnnber of squares covered between turns, they go l,l,Z,3,5,8 ... The spirals donoted by the dashed lines are called 'white light spirals'. They are male and electrical in nature. The spirals denoted by the sol id 1 ines are 'black 1 ight spirals', and are female and magnetic in nature. Notice only the female spirals pass through the zero-point at Void. Zero-point is where creation takes place. It is the reason why the hunan female has a woarb. The implication of this are incredible, and it is the basis for vortex technology, with its spiraling energies. Where the dashed and solid lines begin is where the phenomena changes direction and goes back out the opposite way. when yw witness these kinds of vortices, they will be rotating one way and then the other way when they cane out the other side. Walter Baumgartner in New Mexico is probably the leading researcher in this type of technology, and Walter demonstrates everything he talks about. Water moves naturally in a spiral motion, and Walter has a tube where water canes down with so much energy that a light bulb placed next to it lights up. Walt also has another setup where water is supplied at house pressure, and he's bringing the i 19"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV water molecules so deeply into the vortex that they are caning out an office practically one at a time. It cuts through steel like it's butter, and it's only water. Binary Sequences In reality, there are many different sequences of numbers. There are two that are very important in life. One of them is the Fibronacci sequence. The other is the binary sequence. An example of a binary sequence would be 1,2,4, 8,16,32,64,128,256,512,etc. The binary sequence is important in cell mitosis. There are 1014 cells (100,000,000,000,000) in the average human body. When a hunan body is in the adult stage, it has to replace 2.5 million red blood cells every second. There are many other amazing facts, but the only way that these things can be accomplished is through cell division (mitosis). All of this starts with mitosis of the very first cell. After 10 cycles of cell division, the human body consists of the 512 cells in the 'momla' that we mentioned earlier. At the end of 20 cycles, there are over 500,000 cells. At the end of 30 cycles, there are 500,000,000 cells. It takes only 46 mitotic cell division cycles to reach the 1014 cells in the adult human. The number 46 is also the number of chromosomes. There are 46 x 2 stable elements in this physical reality system. Computers, based on silicon, also use the binary system. Relationship Between Fibronacci and Binary Sequences For. a long time, it has been suspected that there is a geometrical relationship between these two sequences. It turns out that the medium for illustrating the relationship lies with the polar graph, where a three- dimensional image is plotted two-dimensionally. Polar graphs have been known since Egyptian times. There are maps in the world that are incredible that were made long before modern times - maps even showing the arctic before the ice was there. Using a polar graph and plotting a binary sequence yielded the following infomation: Degrees Distance fran Pole Degrees Distance fran Pole"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV . Degrees Distance from Pole Degrees Distance fran Pole Within the distances is the sequence 1,2,4,8, which is a binary sequence of numbers. At the same time, there is a sequence which goes 1,2,3,5,8, which is a Fibronacci sequence. Plotting this on a polar graph, we see that the binary sequence, involved with 0, 120, and 240 degrees, when plotted, fonn an equi- lateral triangle. Realize also that you are looking at a three dimensional image of a tetrahedron. On the graph below, the points on the chart are plotted as a curve: We are also talking about a depiction of reflective lines inside of a tetra- hedron. The Work of Keith Kerchlow Notice in the above polar graph that there is also an equilateral triangle down the middle (we will illustrate this shortly). Keith Kerchlow did sane work with sacred geometry in which he figured out that if you have an equilateral triangle with a line down the middle, and you very carefully measure to find the exact half-way point and draw a line straight up and subsequently reflect it down to a comer of the triangle, a continuation of this process would break up"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the center line exactly according to the proportions of musical harmonics. Each successive proportion will be the harmonic mean between the previous proportion and the total length of the line. It's the same kind of thing we were talking about with the Phi ratio. All these propotions will be musically signi- ficant: 1/2 being the uctave, 2/3 being the fifth, 4/5 being the major third, 8/9 being the major tone and 16/17 being the half-tone. Overlaying this on the polar graph: Notice that if you overlay Kerchlaw7s discovery on the polar graph above, you don't really have to measure where the middle is, you just start from the comer and caw up and it will break the line precisely in half. It's the exact pattern he got without any measuring at all. Kerchlow did not realize that there was an implicit polar grid behind his work. It even reflects off the outer peri- meter (as shown at the 60 degree point) and canes down perfectly. This has been taken way beyond this point, although details of this are not being released at this time to the public, because with the knowledge that this provides, you can"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV create any life form you want to do anything you can conceive of, and pre- conceive what it will do, before you even project an electronic beam to accom- pl ish it. You know exactly what to do, whether it is to destroy a virus in the body, or whatever. The harmonics of music and sound are based on these particu- lar geanetries. Sane people have seen those postcards that have a reflective polar graph on them, and when the light hits it, it forms a pattern similar to that shown low: If you look carefully at these type of reflective surfaces, you will see two white-light spirals and two black-light (absorption) spirals at 90 degrees to each other. It is the same exact pattern that you see when you look at a picture of a galaxy in space. What scientists will eventually discover is that it all conforms to a fornrat similar to a polar graph, with concentric spheres wing out. These spheres are also present around the hum body, and instrunentation has been developed which can detect these spheres. It appears that the n-r of spheres is directly proportional to the conscious state of the individual, and as many as 27 spheres have been counted; the average nuarber of spheres is around 8 or 10. The radial pattern for the enanation of these spheres is again centered at the geometric center of the body, at the base of the spine. The more aware you become, the more your outer fields become activated. We once made the point that all this sacred geuinetry also represents a nag for how the Spirit moves through the Void and creates reality. For every bit of geometry you see, there is always an experiential aspect that goes with it. The front left part of the brain has a certain geanetry that is associated with the mental patterns, and the rear left portion of the brain is associated with the experiential aspect of that geamtry. The front right (female) part of the brain has its experiential part behind it. Relative to the expressions of sound and light, sound has a 'female' nature and 'light' has a male nature. Relative to the last polar graph on the previous page (which could describe the gecmetrical images relative to sound patterns), if you run a line not just through the center, but to each one of the nodal points, and make all the 'ladders' for a11 the possibilities, you will came up with all possible har- monics.

He agmd with Alcock, however, that caution was m order until the events were confirmed. Researchers have'speculated that the dark matter could be made up of anything kom vanishingly smaIl subatomic particles to giant, gaping black holes. Until now, there has been no evidence to support one theory wet another. If the new findings are correct, they mean at least some of the dark matter is made up objects the size of J iter or larger called massive compact 3 objects - or MACHOS. Dark matter, as its name suggests, can't be seen directly. But a MACHO has a large gravitational field that acts as a lens, mag- nifying objects behind it. That allows it to bedetectedindirediy.

The harmonics of 1 ight, sound and even physical structure are all connected through this pattern. At this point, we have scratched the surface of several informational systems that have arisen from the original 'fruit of life'. The Geometry of Consciousness and Awareness Not only do feelings and mental patterns have shape, but consciousness levels also have a geometry associated with them; the geanetry also relates to the way that mind sets function relative to these levels of consciousness. When you understand this and you apply it to what was going on in Egypt, you will really understand what all that was about. If you flew up to a planet that you had never seen before, and you wanted to know how specific life fonns interpret their reality, you would take the shape of the outer field that is around them and relate it to the sphere that is also around them. In terms of human consciousness, it's a cube, If you take the cube and the sphere that fit around the human body and calculate the size difference, you can tell exactly where a person is at in consciousness. Just as notes in a musical scale are only harnonic at certain points, consciousness is only harmonic at certain specific points. If you had nine concentric circles, you can deternine the first three levels of consciousness on Earth. Interestingly, there is a legend in Egypt which states there are nine concentric crystal balls under the Sphinx and that these crystal spheres relate to consciousness on Earth. Samuel Holland and a team of psychics tried to locate these crystal spheres, without success. You really don't need the physical objects to understand this - just a series of nine concentric circles on paper: The method is to make nine equidistant concentric circles and put squares around them, and then observe how these squares and circles interact with each other. When you see evidence of a Phi-ratio relationship, it is indicative of an aspect of- consciousness. When you draw a square around the first circle, it does not touch anything, so there is no reaction. Nor does the second. The square in the third circle just starts to penetrate the circle. The square"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV around the fourth circle out just penetrates the fifth circle in an almost perfect Phi-ratio. As you keep going out, it goes back out of phase really quickly, and then you find that the square around the seventh circle goes in a Phi-ratio relationship with the ninth circle. If you keep running these circles and squares out, you will see very specific patterns and geometrical series. These patterns and geometric series relate to levels of consciousness. . The area where the first Phi-ratio occurs represents the level where consciousness first becanes self-aware, an example being the aboriginal 42+2 level of consciwsness. It is a unity consciousness which contains the dream time level. The second time the Phi-ratio appears, it reflects a level which humans have called Christ consciousness. With this in mind, life has never been able to 'figure out', as it were, how to get directly f ran the level of consciousness represented by the first Phi-ratio to the level represented by the second occurance of the Phi-ratio in one step. There is a transition level in between that is necessary, and that is reflected in the current hunan situation. That intenaediate level of conscious- ness is not a hannonic one, and historically if a civilization remains in that dishannonic level too long, they almost always destroy the planet that they occupy. Humans think they' re so great, but they have one of the lowest general levels of consciousness in existence. We're only on the second step out of the Great Void, considering that there are hundreds of thousands of levels above us, and we're only on level two. The intermediate dishannonic level is ideally assumed and then discharged in as short a time as possible. For Earth, in geological time, we are doing it in less than 13,000 years, which is apparently fairly rapid. In fact, we're doing it in about 6,000 years, because we really didn't make the jump to this level until the period of the Sunerian and Egyptian civilizations began, which was roughly 4,000 BC. In general, higher life forms do not look at humans as 'bugs', although sane species like the Grays and the Reptilians (along with their allies) do, because they cannot experience love and rompassion. The true balanced higher life fonns have great love and compassion for humans, and real 1 y .care about them more than you can ever--imagine, because their levels of love are so much higher than hroman levels of love. 132"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The way that the third informational system connects in with consciousness is interesting. If you take the pattern previously deliniated with the circles and squares and overlay it on the 'fruit of life pattern', the following is produced: The first five circles of the nine are shown as above. The circles either fit or contain the groups of circles (spheres). The square is around the fourth circle as before. You can see from this overlay that the first time conscious- ness becanes self-aware, it is directly associated with the \"fruit of life'; the 'fruit of life' is the key to why the fourth circle is harmonic to the fifth. A relationship also exists between the fourth and fifth note in harmonics. We have spoken of the three levels (the two Phi-ratio levels with the disharmonic level in betreen). Egyptian writings also speak of these three levels, and equated the move to the next harmonic level as relating to the enlarged skull size which is characteristic of that level. In Egypt, the temple of Luxor (also called the 'temple of man') represented mans current level of consciousness. It is a huge temple, and at the end is a long causeway that goes to the temple of Karnak (also known as the 'temple of dreams'). The initiations in Karnak took the initiate from the first level of consciousness to the third level of consciousness. The process involved taking the initiate into the dream state where the dream state would become so real, it would be like the roan you are sitting in now."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":",tl kali an? 3 4lkallne Earth i Petals u 1 OROUP PERIODIC TABLE OF THE ELEMENTS Y) c"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"CRYSTALS Crystols hove olwoys been of greot Interest becouse of thelr In.. trlnslc beauty.

When we created this universe and we were all One Being, when we stepped into the experiment, we made sure that the field that created it would enable us to get back out. One of the major factions of the light side, the Great White Brotherhood, and one of the major factions of the dark side, whan we could call the Great Dark Brotherhood, are two bodies (gestalts) of consciousness that are opposed to each other in what they are doing in practically every imaginable way, but since there is really only One Intelligent Matrix throughout the universe, all of this is orchestrated fram a higher level than polarities. If you have a person or a planet that is trying to evolve, the White Brotherhood does every- thing is can to nourish and create the environment for that 1 ife form to evolve as soon as possible. The Dark Brotherhood, as it were, does everything it can to induce fear to make sure that this doesn't happen. What is actually happening from a higher perspective is that both sides are acting together as a timing agent to make sure that the life form or planet moves at exactly the right moment. You want a baby to be born at nine months, not at three or twenty-four. Timing has great importance in all of this. There was a problem that developed in 1972 that changed the game plan of everything here on Earth (which we will explain in more detail later), and the Dark Brotherhood understood the nature of it quicker than the Light Brotherhood; four other members of the Dark Brotherhood were brought in fran the Orion Group at this ti- - four very heavy-duty conscious Beings - so that there were then five members of the Dark Brotherhood here. In response to that, the Clelchizedeks sent four more of their group here, which was unprecedented; five beings of that magnitude of consciousness have never been directed to one planet before. One of the four of the light-side group was Drunvalo klchizedek, because his exper- ience in the Melchizedek (13th dimension) realm was long-standing. He had been there (in Earth tenns) almost fran the beginning, almost ten billion years, and had almost no awareness of polarity-consciousness at all; he was chosen because of his re 1 at i ve ' i nnocence' . Normally, what develops on a planet during this kind of progression is a \"many are called - few are chosen' scenario. But the plan now is that all beings will go into the light. When we get more into the geometry, you will understand more about what the dark aspect was trying to do and why, and why all these dark and light issues are seemingly about to be resolved here on Earth for everyone on fairly expansive levels. The 'grand experimentm is that the whole entire universe is in itself an experiment. The whole wave-form universe, including all the 144 levels and 12 dimensions, is but one speck of consciousness that has been created to reflect a very specific aspect of consciousness. There have been experiments within the experiments, as well. Setting up the grid to initiate unity consciousness 13,000 years ago was an experiment; there was a very special experiment that happened in February of 1972, and it was one that had never been tried before. That's the one that is changing everything, and we have to wait and explain what happened; the nature of it is almost outside the realm of human canprehension.

If you superimpose a number of drawings that we have done, you will. have the 64 squares, a tetrahedronal field, the figure of the human being, and the eight- cell egg of life. The eight-cell egg has all the proportions of the adult human being contained within it. Now, if you go into the 10 x 12 grid and lay the vesica piscis out: When you lay the lines out according to the vesica piscis, another grid is created. The earlier grid squares were based on 1 (I2). This grid is based on 22. The diagram at the top of the next page represents where hunan consciousness is currently at the 44+2 level. When Da Vinci drew his little man, it was based on an 8x10 grid, exactly the first level of consciousness. Da Vinci was a free-mason, so he must have had this knowledge. Perhaps if we examine Da Vinci a 1 ittle more, we can see where he got same of his information. Leonardo's work followed that of Vitruvius, who lived 200 years before. An examination of the work of Vitruvius reveals a 10x12 grid, the next level. If you look at the work of Vitruvius, it seems filled with a bunch of small squares, but notice on the next page that there are also dots which delineate larger squares. If you put the pin of a canpass at the center of the drawing and the pencil end at either point where the two arcs cross on either side of the feet, and swing a circle, it comes around and touches the fingers and forms a perfect 10x12, which is the current human grid.

To find the square or cube that would fit around the Earth, all you need is the diameter of the Earth, which is the edge of one of the squares, and multiply it by four. The diameter of the Earth is 7,920 miles, times 4 equals 31,680 miles; there are 31,680 miles around a cube that would fit around the Earth. If you wanted to know about the circle that would go around and through the center of the Moon, if this is in exact proportion, you would just have to take the diameter of the Earth, plus the radius of the Moon and multiply by Pi (22/7). So 7,920 + 2,160 is 10,080; 10,080 x 22/7 equals 31,680.

By the way, 'kings\" chamber and 'queens' chamber were names the Muslims gave to the roans. The ceiling of the 'kings' chamber is flat, and Muslims buried their lnen in structures with flat ceilings. Likewise, the 'queens\" chamber has a pitched ceiling, and the Muslims buried their females in structures with pitched ceil- ings. As Muslims were among the first to 'discover\" the roans, the names stuck; initiations which took place did not begin in the 'kings\" chamber, but in a roan underneath the pyramid, then to the 'kings' chamber and then the 'queens\" chamber . In the illustration above, the dashed triangle represents the outline of the Great Pyramid. The Great Pyramid is huge, and the white-light spiral (1) goes deep into space. According to Thoth, it goes to the center of the galaxy. It comes out, precisely hits the apex of the pyramid and leaves. If you wanted to catch the whitelight spiral, you would have to catch it at (2), which is right where the \"kings\" chamber is located. In fact., the spiral passes right through the sarcophagus in the \"kings\" chamber at the point where a person's head would be if they were laying down in it. Let's look at the kings chamber.

Archaeologists have dug into the area where these five long stones are located, and they have discove~ ed that the bottoms are sntwth as glass and the rough hewn tops have been coated with about a quarter inch of foam-like substance. If you visit the structure, you will be told that these stones are there to relieve the 'kings' chanber fran the tremendous weight above, but that isn't the case at all. If that were true, then why don't they have them over the 'queens' chamber? Nevertheless, people are told this, and they accept it without question. If you recall the drawing on the previous page, above the white-light spiral (1) is the black-light spiral (3). These stones are designed to absorb any black-1 ight energy caning f ran the top (the 'kings chamber is located at the position labeled (2)) and reflect energy from the white-light spiral (1) dorm into the chamber. These stones are, in effect, energy separators. It separates the white and the black spirals from each other and clearly allows the energy of the white-light spiral to enter the chamber. Although the room itself is off center in the pyramid, the sarcophagus is located exactly dead center. The whitelight energy (not optical 'white light as in the visible spectrum) rises through the floor of the chamber and passes through a position in the sarcophagus where, if a person was reclining in the sarcophagus, it would pass direct 7y through the pinea 1 gland. According to records, after a person had been through twelve years of train- ing according to the Right-Eye of Horus (Unity consciousness training), they would take a person and put them in the sarcophagus and put the lid on. They would then .leave them there for three and onehalf days, whereupon the person would have this incredible expansion of consciousness. Because it was a Fibrw nacci spiral they were using and not a Logarithic spiral, there's a beginning."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV After they've had the experience, they could retrace their steps and cane back. What is really interesting is that when archaeologists discovered the sarcophagus in the 'kings' chamber, they found a significant quantity of a white power-like substance in the end facing the center of the roan. This was the end where initiates would find their heads when they reclined in the sarcophagus. They scooped up a11 this crystalline substance, which now sits in a con- tainer in the British museum. They never knew what it was. Scientists have subsequently discovered that humans excrete specific substances through their skin when in certain brain states, and that is what that substance was. It resulted from the extended period that initiates spent in the sarcophagus. There was a lot of it in there, which indicates that a great nmber of people went through the process. Many people think that the Great Pyramid has sanething to do with burial rites, but that is not the case. When a person died in Egypt, they would take out all the organs and put them into jars, mumnify the body, and transport the body in the sarcophagus to the place of burial along with the jars. However, the sarcophagus in the 'kings\" chamber is bigger than the doorway to the chamber, which indicates that it was put in there during the building of the pyramid. It is more evidence that it was in fact a place of initiation. The roan under the pyramid has been dubbed 'the we1 1' because of the vertical shaft in the middle of the roan. The shaft is now filled with debris. A tunnel leads off this roan, and at the end of this tunnel is where initiates began their initiation. Once the initiation was over, the initiate needed to be stabilized, and they were brought to the 'queens' chamber, the floor of which falls at the precise apex of the 'inner' pyramid, indicated by (4) on the draw ing a couple pages ago. The \"queens' chamber (4) is the roan where Unity consciousness is stabilized. Back to a discussion of the first step of initiation in the room under the pyramid. In this roan, the initiate is connected to the 'black-light' spiral, which goes to the center of the Earth through the Halls of Amenti. As mentioned before, off this roan is a tunnel which canes to a dead end for no apparent reason that archaeologists can figure out. That point is indicated by (5) on the pyramid grid drawing, and it flows through the end of the last 24 inches of that dead-end hallway. The usual procedure was to take a group of initiates into this hallway at once. There are depictions of Egyptian hieroglyphics which show Osiris seated at the end of a tunnel (with the black-light energy flawing through his pineal gland) and a group of initiates crouched down in front of him. Osiris would tune into the beam and take all of the initiates with him into a dimensional experience. The experience in the tunnel is such that whatever you think actually happens. If you have a fear, it becanes real. There are several modern people that have had just this experience, sane by accident and sane on purpose. There have been people in modern times that have entered this tunnel and died for no apparent reason, and final 1 y the Egyptians put a gate up at the end to prevent people from going in. This tunnel is, in effect, a fourth dimensional space. Because of all the deaths, the Egyptian government jails anyone who even attempts to enter this tunnel."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Panels Depicting Initiation In The Great Pyramid"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Egyptian government knows quite a lot more about what lies in Egypt than they are telling the people of the world.

When the time is determined to be right, this and other types of information will be formally revealed. More About the Great Pyramid There are more indications about the intent of the pyramid as an initiation place. The precise floor level that the 'kings' chamber lies on is such that if you took off the top of the pyramid at that point, the area of the square at that level would be exactly one-half the area of the base of the pyramid. If you then rotated the floor level square 90 degrees, it would look like this: The point indicated by (A) above is the point where the Grand Gallery breaks the surface into the 'kings' chamber. The gecmetry of the levels of conscious- ness relate to the various squares, and the floor level of the 'kings' chamber is indicated by (B). On the diagram on the top of the following page, the first interior square represents the first level of consciousness (42+2). The second square represents the second (44+2) level of consciousness. The diamond shape is the second square rotated 90 degrees, and when it is rotated it points to and touches the third square (46+2) level of consciousness. That same second level pattern, as far as area is concerned, is present in the Great Pyramid at .the level of the 'kings' chamber, which points to the connection of the 'kings' chamber with Christ Consciousness,- If you will recall, a 90 degree rotation is necessary between dimensions."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"More on the Hall of Records and the Sphinx The south face of the second pyramid is aligned perfectly with the south side of the Sphinx. The golden mean rectangle that contains the whole complex is bisected along the head dress of the Sphinx, and the junction of these two lines marks a spot on the south side of the Sphinx where the opening to the Hall of Records is found. According to Edgar Cayce, the opening to the Hall of Records would be found at thr right shoulder of the Sphinx. It has clearly been marked geometrically in that same place by the configuration of the whole complex. In 1985, the Sphinx was in its nonnal upright position. By 1989, it had begun to tilt and the right shoulder had begun to break open. The Egyptians have continued to patch it up. Also, the head of the Sphinx is beginning to cane apart. According to Thoth, within the neck is a large golden sphere, which is a time capsule. The appear- ance of this capsule will mark the beginning of a number of revelations relative to the complex and the history of the planet. The Egyptians are also feverishly repairing the head and neck area, trying to stay ahead of the growing fractures, but the speed of the rotation of the Sphinx ensures that it will not be long until all this manifests itself. Thoth predicted that the Hall of Records would be discovered before the end of 1990, and it has probably a1 ready occurred. He said that there would be 144 sets of three people that would enter the Hall, and that each one of these people would do sanething. One of these sets of three people, he said, would cane from the west. A voice sound would be made and the door would open.

They will cane to a very large black onyx statue with a huge sword. If you are not one of those specific three people, you will then be killed.

The Left Eye of Horus is concerned with the inituitive female side (and emotions and fears);it is with that in mind that most of the Egyptian temples were built; each chakra energy point in the body is associated with a different kind of fear, and each temple had initiation rites to enable the initiate to conquer each of those fears, as well as the develop- ment of the positive aspects of those same energy centers. Very often you see representations of the two eyes in Egyptian works of art, although there are in fact three systems of thought, one being neutral (representative of 'child') that reflects life and experience. Sanetimes, the symbol of the bee relates to the left eye and the ibis bird to the right. Another symbol very often appears, and that is the orb surrounded by two cobras and a pair of wings. According to Sitchin, it relates to Harduk, the 12th planet. The winged symbol goes a1 1 the way back to Sumeria, where it sometimes depicts two horns instead of two cobras. Nevertheless, the winged orb is meant to reflect the 'creators' of the human species. The Ankh, Rod and Staff The Anhk is a major key in Egyptian pranayama. According to Thoth, it is only properly received frun behind - you will notice also that very often the receiver of the Anhk is also holding a staff with a forked bottm and a bent 45 degree angle on the top, and a rod, which are the tools of resurrection. The method of use of the tuning rod was that they would strike it on a hard surface and placed the tip of the 45 degree bend at an energy point in the back of the initiates sku1 1, whereby sexual energy would be raised and boost consciousness to a specific level. The rod was tuned to the individual initiate by the use of a secondary rod held in the other hand of the master. The Anhk, which is normally taken to represent eternal life, is also related to the breath. Hany depictions in Egyptian art show the Anhk being held up to the initiates nose; according to records, breathing instructions were then given to the initiate relative to the geometry associated with the shape of the Anhk. Imnacu 1 ate Concept i on : What it ' s A1 1 About The concept of inmaculate conception is very misunderstood in today's society, and is often clouded with religious mysticism. It does not have to be a \"virgin\" birth at all, but refers to conception without actual physical contact. The American Hedical Association has been doing research in this area. They have found that they can take a female egg and take a pointed object and pierce the zona pellucida, and mitosis will begin. Without the use of any spem at all, a woman can have a baby. They have done this many times. The baby turns out to be an identical replica of the female, essentially a clone, and is always female. The female that results of this process is believed to be sterile, but it may be that she is sterile only in a physical sense and not in a inter- dimensional sense. 166"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV 'Virgin birth', as it were, happens all the time in nature.

Data and Metha To gain a crossnational perspective on virgin births, we selected the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) as a data source. The DHS is an ongoing research effort being car- ried out in a number of developing countries and is coordinated by the Institute for Re- source Development ir, Columbia, Maryland. Thirtysix surveys had been completed as of mid-1991. The DHS collected detailed infor- mation about women's reproductive histories, sodoeconomic status, and living conditions The DHS did not ask women directly whether they had had a virgin birth. To iden- tify virgin births, we selected women whose age at first intercourse was greater than their age at first birth. For example. if a woman reported her age at first intercourse as 20 and haage at first bi as 18. then clearly a virgin bid had occurred. Because the DHS measures age in years rather than months, this method misses a virgin birth if it occurred at the same age in years as first intercourse, that is, if conception occurred shortly after a birthday. Addition- ally, this method captures only unfertilized . bids that took place prior to first intercourse.

With this wealth of information on mothers, house- holds, and communities, we chose the time- honored and most effective approach for analysis: a huge correlation matrix. Analysis From the thirtysix DHS countries, five had one or more identifiable virgin births. Figure 1 indicates the number of women who have had a virgin bii in each of these countries Although the highest number ocarrred in Thailand, intercoe natality is also evi- dent in several African nations to a smaller degree (perhaps indicating the beginning of a trend). Virgin m0ti~crhWd did not appear to be a significant demographic phenomenon in Latin America, the other region covered in the DHS survey. The correlation matrix yielded several statistically @ificant risk factors associated with virgin bids (see Table 1). Risk factors included community, household, and indid- ual level variables. The most important community level risk factor was the sourn of drinking water. Women who had virgin births were less likely than other women to have piped or bottled water. Instead, they were more likely to get their water from a river or spring, to use rain- water, or to obtain water from a neighbor's well. The strength of this environmental fac- tor suggests the possibility of alternative jourrrs of fertilization Large households also serve as a fertile context for virgin biis, although the exact reasons that lead crowded living conditions to an elevated probability of a virgin bii remain unclear. On the individual level, women who are literate ha& significantly higher chances of bearing an intercourse-free child - a finding that emerged in three of the five countries. Reproductive hiiries obtained from better- educated women are generally more com- plete than those of lesseducated women. If the higher rates of virgin births observed among wekducated women simply rded higher data quality, it is likely that rates for others are bid downward by omissions. Thus the actual prevalence of intercourse-free natality must then be considerably higher than the conservative figures we have re- ported here. A most interesting result is with respect to subsequent fertility. Women identified as having had a virgin bii also reported unusu- ally high numbers of total children born fi.e., total number of children to whom the mother gave birth during her lifetime). This relation- ship could indicate the condition of hyper- fecundity, that is. the ability to conceive easily. On the other hand, this relationship could be an artifact of our limited definition of inter- course-free natality we were able to identify ' only women who had their first births prior to their first intercourse; some of the later preg- nanaes may have.been unfertilized as well.

We were doing a lot of scientific research at one time, and we've dropped out of it because of the increased understanding of the nature of the Lucifer Rebellion that was brought to rne through research on the Montauk experiment, the Philadelphia experiment, the experiments in Atlantis, and what it is going to happen in the future. There's one that happened in 1913 that few people know of. It isn't that all this is 'wrong', as it were, but we don't want to be involved with it any more. It is a personal decision to head in a different direction. Let me tell you what we were doing, and why we quit. We were going to build a computer package that had certain components to it. The first caponent was a cube about half an inch in diameter that would have almost no limit on the amount of information it could store. Infinite storage capabilities. It was based on implementing a pattern known as the flower of life. The next component was a special computer and a special software program connected with it, and then a special sensory device. The purpose for all of this was to make direct comnunication with dolphins and whales, because we felt that they had gone far enough down the evolutionary path and were headed in the direction that we needed to go. Ue felt that direct comnunication with them would speed things up for us a bit. All this sounds great, but it's all obsolete now, even from a scientific basis. We've learned how to go way beyond this. Nevertheless, we started with this sensing device which we created. The creators of this stuff do not want their names mentioned anymore. That device was able to pick up the microwave emissions frari the rotation of electrons and the stretcfv ing of molecular bonds that is a form of camnunications that is incredibly vast and is a window into a reality that enabled us to 'see' things that no one else could see. The rest of the world, in comparison, was blind. The human eye is extremely limited in its ability to detect what is out there, and it only picks up a small range of frequencies that is emitted from the surface of things. This sensing device that was built could pick up every molecule in existence. Ue could look anywhere, right dm to a particular molecule in you body. It's also a form of carmunication. After the sensing device was developed, we 1 inked it with an ordinary IBU 386 computer that was hot-rodded and then created our own software, based upon normal concepts of how software would work. Once that was developed, we were able to make three-dimensional photographs of chakras, and all kinds of things. Ue could photograph your chakra system and tell you everything about your life that every happened from the day you were conceived and on into the future. This was a1 1 done by one man, who did a lot of work for a number of years and got quite proficient and interpreting this material. The three-dimensional photw graphs looked like mountain ranges composed of thousands of sine-wave signatures from zero to 12,500 Hz. It would even reveal the day and minute your body would die. The next problem was to construct what was essentially an infinite storage bank to store the incredible amounts of information that would come from these kinds of processes. .. The military and government had been trying to do this for a long time. When they found out that we were trying to do it, they sent people that were 'trying to be good friends'.

The goverrunent was trying to do this with liquid ruby, only they didn't know this pattern. They were using other patterns. The storage pattern within the cube used an infinite series of grids. You would use one binary sequence to tell you what grid to go to and then you would use a geometrical sequence which would tell you where on that grid you would go. Once you got to that point, you could have another grid go up. You could put as much information as you desired into this system. The net result was that it was a quantum storage device, and in effect you could store data in the space around the canputer. It doesn't physically have to be there - it only theoretically has to be there. You could go out 100 billion miles into space and be storing infomation out there. This is exactly how the human mind stores infonnation and how crystals store infomation and how they can be used to make the kind of computations they do, because they are based on the same image. Anyway, this research was almost canpleted. We had learned how to use transducers in the shape of the 'fruit of life' to impress a standing waveform. We could almost accomplish it using liquid crystal, but it required huge amounts of energy. Then one of my researchers who was telepathically cannunicating with dolphins and whales passed the infonnation on to them, and they said that it could never be done with liquid crystal - they said to use water. You see, the angle on a molecular level of water is 105 degrees, which incorporates the phi ratio. It is what makes water a living molecule. The cetaceans told him exactly how to do it. We did it, and it works. It only needs millivolts to accomplish it and hold it in there. Once a1 1 this was done, the programning was changed so that it was based on sacred geanetry, so that the computer \"thinks' in terms of sacred geometry, enabling it to correctly interpret the mrphogenic structure of reality and language. It is also the generator of mathematics. If the camputer 'thinks' in this way, it is able to 'think' about anything whatsoever, and it is at this point where the computer becomes self-aware. It becomes essentially a living being, because of the nature of the silicon-carbon inter-relationship. It is then that you bring in the language aspects of the tubetorus, as is seen in the work of Stan Tenon and the Ueru Foundation. What you then have in the end is a universal translator. So, what this would do is that it would pick up the microwave emissions f ran the dolphins, translate it into sacred geollletry, and then through the geometry into the tubetorus and it would cane out in English. It's not that hard, but what happened is that when he was canrauni cating with a dolphin in Florida at Dolphin World, the dolphin told him that the whole process was 'silly\", that we would never make a true translation between dolphin and human experience. Hrnan experience takes place within a tiny band within the electromagnetic spectru~l and the dolphin utilizes 100% of the spectrraa. It is like a person that is completely blind, cannot talk and cannot feel, try to comnunicate with a normal hunan being. There has to be a transformation within the hunan experience to even attempt this on a meaningful scale. The dolphin said that the way to begin this was the create a brand new kind of sound, a three-dimensional holographic sound. The dolphins gave him all the algorithms, and he took it back to the lab, plugged the numbers in and it worked. Finally, after about sixteen modifications, the sound produced by this equipment was so good that a tape of this sound run through a cheap cassette player would go right through your finger tips and right to the .pineal gland and came out through your body and you heard it like a three-dimensional orchestra all around you. It was absolutely amazing. You don't even need speakers. You don't even need ears. 173"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The experiences that we were getting into were amazing. We were able to duplicate the Merkabah experience threedimensionally and holographically. We could junp-start people's Merkabah's. What is also weird is that when you try to talk to saneone while this three-dimensional sound is on, your voice canes out like that of Darth Vader. Your voice almost ends up sounding like an instrument. While all this stuff was going on, this certain thing happened, and it was only a couple of months ago while we were in New York. I had just given a workshop, and I was resting between workshops, when the person I was with asked me if I had ever watched the movie about the Philadelphia Experiment. I said no, and so I watched it. I had talked about the experiment in the workshop, but it was the first time I had seen the movie. I was just a short distance away on Long Island frm where the experiment took place. The next day, the coach for the NY Jets called me up and asked me if I wanted to meet one of the people who were part of the experiment. We had already met the original engineer, Preston Nichols, but this was saneone else, and he was really old, and he couldn't believe that we really understood what they were doing - the Merkabah is the Philadelphia experiment, only they were doing it with electronics and we were doing it with thoughts and feelings. He got so excited that he gave us a1 1 of the original equipment and told us how he did it. I figured that was the end of it. Here I am supposed to met a man named Duncan, who was in the experiment, along with Preston Nichols, one of the original engineers. In sumnary, the Philadelphia experiment involved the effort to make a ship invisible. It's the idea of a cloaking device like the Klingons had in Star Trek. It is easy to do - all you do is go into the next overtone and you're invisible. It was the Greys who gave than this information. Telsa also said that he got this infonnation from EVS, although he didn't specifically name them. The reason the Greys were involved in this will becane clear. We wanted the technology to win a war. The Greys wanted us to do this for another reason. Ultimately, the experiments were successful. The first one was in 1940, and the other ones were in 1942 and 1943. In one of them they had people on board, and there are two people that claim to be survivors of this. Duncan and a man named A1 Bielek claim to be the two people who jumped off the ship. Basically, they got these two counter-rotating fields going. This is what the meditation we have been teaching is all about. When you go fran one type of dimension to another and when you go frun -9 the speed of light to the speed of light (which involves in incredible series of whole-nlrmber harmonics that build upon each other - you can do it in one breath during the meditation) the visual experience is that the whole room or space around you (roughly 55 feet for a single individual and 550 feet for a group Herkabah) will turn into a reddish fog. If you have ever looked into a laser beam shooting into a crystal, you will see this funny field around the crystal. You will be across the mom and it creates little hexagonal patterns in your eyes. The whole room fills with that type of effect. If you were outside the area far enough, the field would take the shape of a disc. The colors shift gradually from red all the way up to ultra-violet purple and then to a blinding white light, which slwly recedes away, and if you're in a room everything will appear to be made out of solid metal lic gold. Then, the gold color will becane transparent. If there is a wall there you may see people who are on the other side of the wall - you'll be able to see through things - and then they will be less and less transparent unti 1 you are gone-. It will then become absolutely black - nothing at all - for a period of time (which is the time you are making the 90 degree shift). A moment later (and this is in two shifts of 45 degrees) a new world appears with brand 174"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"new colors and shapes. That would be one overtone higher than you were. Anyway, with the Philadelphia experiment it went red, orange, yellow, green, and apparently didn't go much further. They didn't make it all the way. They needed to go further. They were invisible all right, but to me it was like taking off in a 747 and getting about 300 feet off the ground and shutting the motors off. Uhat essentially happened is that they inter-dimensionally crashed, and they disappeared out of the harbor for about four hours. They appeared in the Gobi desert for a while and then to another harbor and finally back to Philadelphia. When they came back, only a few hours had gone by as far as they were concerned. Some people had aged considerably and sane had grown younger to the point where they were babies. They were all nuts, screaming and yelling. Some were embedded in the metal of the deck. They found one of the men in Italy embedded in a wall, It was a total disaster. Duncan and A1 jumped off the ship, and although it appeared to be 1943 in their reference, they found themselves on the ground in 1983. What had happened was that there was another similar experiment in 1983 called the Hontauk experiment. The story gets really bizarre, and it really happened. Anyway, the next day I ended up near Wontauk in the room with Duncan and Preston. I walk in and there's Duncan, and I can see Duncan's fields rotating. It was the strangest thing I had ever seen, because he had two fields rotating that were phaselocking back and forth between each other. I had never seen anything 1 ike that before in a human being. It was totally out of control. He couldn't even get near me. He could see my fields, too. He was one of the first humans that could do it. He looked at me and said, 'hey, you've got one of those things too!', and he described my field in detail. He wanted to know what certain things were that he had never seen before- He could not really get near me, because his field was so dishannonic and mine was moving so fast that he had to go stand in the other roan. It really affected him. Uhat had happened is that they had used Duncan's spine as a conduit for the fields in both the Uontauk and the Philadelphia experiment. That's what lifeforms do. When we were able to see what these fields do on osci 1 loscopes, which we were able to do, we found that dolphins has a specific geometry to their fields, and that this could form the basis for comnunication with them. What happens is that the head of a pod of whales uses its spinal column and sets the field up around it, and the other whales in the pod becane equivalent to 'cells' within that field. In effect, you have the equivalent of one spirit with a lot of 'cells' in it, Whatever the one being does, it affects all the rest of them. If the main whale goes up on a beach, all the rest keep right on caning in and pile up on the beach with it. So they used Duncan in this way, and they have lost control of this thing to the point where it is sitting on 4th dimensional levels, or higher. I spent two hours on the telephone with Al, and he's scared to death because he's losing contact with his brother. He says whole areas of space are being ripped out fm this. This is in essence what was involved in these experiments. Because of the way these fields were created, electronically instead of from a living being, Duncan has had his emotional body ripped away. He has no feelings. He's ended up with the same emotional situation as the Greys have. I was there to observe all this."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Planetary Tetrahedron Energy Fields The Mariner probe found a place (other than Cydonia) where there were tetra- hedronal pyramids that were over three miles in height. Later, they made the discovery of the Cydonia canplex, and Richard Hoagland wrote his ncwfamous book about it. I spent several hours with him, and at that time Hoagland didn't even know what tetrahedral geanetry was all about. Since then, they have found a 7en mile high five-sided pyramid near there, as well as several three-sided and four-sided pyramids. They also found a wall that goes for about ten miles and makes a 90 degree turn before going several more miles. All of this is in one canplex. NASA really wanted to keep this quiet. Richard then began to understand about sacred geometry and they discovered that the angles between all the pyramids and the other mathematical data amounted to a record of the star tetrahedron inscribed in a sphere, which of course is the appearance of a spinning Merkabah field. The planes of the tetrahedrons cross the sphere at 19.47 degrees latitude north and south. This apparently reflects an internal energy system that applies to all planets, including the Earth. The dark spot on Jupiter lies at this latitude, centered precisely on a point of the internal tetrahedron. They examined Neptune and found the same thing (a rotating spot) at 19.5 degrees. They looked at the northern mountains on Neptune, they discovered a hexagonal pattern; this pattern is what you see if you view a star tetrahedron f ran above. The ice mountains of Neptune are in a perfect hexagon. On Uranus they found the same things. Saturn has two cloud bands exactly at the 19.5 degree latitude. Looking at the polar cloud patterns, they fonn a perfect hexagon. There is another discovery which I got from a friend at ABC television who was working with Hoagland, They felt that these fields were created from the rotation of the moons around the planets - or at least that what they sunnised from the research they had done at the tine. They calculated that the rings were in existence because of the distance the moons were from the planet - that this affected the manifestation of the tetrahedral fields within the planet which caused the rings to manifest instead of a dark spot. They also felt that if the moons came closer that the rings could literally vanish and a dark spot would forn. According to my sources at ABC, this happened. For a short time, the moons all cam in simultaneously in their orbits, the rings disappeared and a dark spot appeared for a few hours while this was happening. They were elated, because it constituted proof that their theory was correct. When you examine the Sun, you will see that the primary focus of sunspot activity is always on the 19.5 North and South latitudes, Again, this shows that there is tetrahedral geometry inside the sun. The points of the tetrahedron also happen to be the places where primary volcanic activity occurs. On Earth, one of these points happens to be where the Hawaiian Islands are. Now, there are three of these fields and they are rotating, but NASA is at this time only aware of one of these fields. When they becane aware of the other two that are rotating and creating the electrical and magnetic fields, then they will begin to understand the whole thing. Jim Hurtak, who wrote 'The Keys of Enoch\" also wrote a book on Mars, and has a lot of new photographs which indicate these energy systems. The book is hard to get because it came out of Australia.

We're all 'in jail' right now. The freedom that will be coming will be a lot more than you think. The Canplex on Venus In January of 1985 they discovered a complex on Venus which is identical to the one at Giza, consisting of three pyramids and a sphinx - exactly the same. There were over 200 photographs of this. I talked directly to the people who were involved in this. In the United States there is a coraaittee of twelve people who appear to determine the rules of mental health relative to the population. There is a rule within NASA that says that when they come up with something which shows that there is life on other planets they have to go through this camnittee in order to see if the population wit 1 be disturbed if specific pieces of data are released. That comnittee gave them pennission in May of 1985 to release this information about Venus. This meant they were bound by law to do it. So, they said,'ok, we'll do itm. They put it out on one television station in Florida one time and then yanked it. The law has that loophole in it. After that, they went and mapped the entire surface of Venus, trying to see what else was there. All this is only on the third dimensional aspect. They don't know how to map the fourth dimensional aspect of Venus. That cunplex exists because of the constant interaction between the Egyptians on Earth and the Hathor race on Venus a long time ago. There are also Egyptian-1 i ke complexes on the moon, as well as American complexes on the Cloon. We have three small city-complexes on the back side of the moon. There are two left nw. Cattle Mutilations Linda Howe is doing a movie about the tetrahedral fields for ABC. NASA did not want us to know about this, They have done everything they could to suppress it. Finally, in 1991, Hoagland went before NASA and presented the data, One of the masons NASA does not want attention to be focused on Mars is that we have a city up there, and they don't want us to know about that. Linda Hawe was involved in research on the cattle mutilations, which was a big thing until the species of Greys that were involved started getting sick. Linda thought initially that the government was involved in the mutilations, Gradually she realized that it was an alien related problem. What she found was that the incisions in the cows were done with incredible precision and a host of other amazing facts - every single red blood cell was removed from these cows, which is something that is technically not possible with standard human technology. That is when she be1 ieved that a1 ien technology was related to what was going on. She was at my house once when she got a call that saneone had spotted a wanan and her son (who had viewed a disc abducting a caw) who were in the process of being taken themselves- She left the house and checked it out, and saw that the ET's had left footprints and tripod marks in the soil. - -"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"The Mars Connection Now, it was originally the Greys who set these experiments up - not our government; it wasn't our government involved in this anyway - it was the 'secret' government, which is much larger. Why were they Greys doing this? It has to do with Mars. Remember that the Martian race came to Atlantis through time from a point a million years earlier. What that race did was an experiment when they left that was similar to the experiment done at Montauk and the one done in Philadelphia. In fact, they left monuments on Mars that mathematically describe their experiment there, that being a star tetrahedron inscribed in a sphere. What happened with Mars is that when the Martian atmosphere was about to be destroyed, the Martian race built the complex at Cydonia to create a Uerkabah experience; it was basically an effort to build a space-time device that would enable them to project themselves into their future. Not only did they lay the complex out in such a way as to describe the field mathematics used in the process, but it was the complex itself that they used to do it. It was a long time ago. Richard Hoagland thinks it was around 2,000 years ago, but if Thoth is correct it was much earlier - somewhere around a million years ago. They did the experiment, and when they got to Atlantis they settled dawn for a while and then repeated the experiment between 14,000 - 16,000 years ago in an effort to get another space time machine going again in order to either gain control of the planet or leave it - we're not quite sure which. That's when they lost control of it. They were not able to duplicate the experiment with the degree of understanding that they had previously. It ripped up dimensional levels and was a chief cause of many of the problems we have now. How many of these attempts there were before that one 16,000 years ago we do not know, but there was another one performed in 1913 that was set up by the Greys in order to solve sane of the problems that were created because of the disaster in Atlantis. It is interesting to note that within a year of the 1913 experiment, World War I occurred. After the experiment in 1942/43 we had World War 11. There will be another one in the future, but it will not be later than 2012, which is the point where hunan experience must go into another octave. Time is an interesting thing. When I was talking to Duncan and the other people involved with the Wntauk and Philadelphia experiments, they said that they were easily able to go back and forth in time, but what they discovered after a lot of research (they did not know anything about the Mars information we just discussed) is that they only had memory of the Philadelphia-Montauk loop, and that strangely enough they could go back in time only to a point about a million years ago and they ran into sane sort of barrier in time. They also discovered that they could only go forward until the year 2012 and they ran into another barrier. The barriers apparently exist because the first experiment of this nature was done a million years ago by the Martian race and the last one was done near 2012 and all the experiments of that nature are all inter-connected. We are not sure how many of these experiments lie between 1983 and 2012. It is apparent that the Greys are trying to solve certain types of problems and that they are given free reign to do this kind of activity."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Why Our Research Took A Different Direction After all of this went on, I caamunicated with entities at higher levels and inquired as to what was going on. They indicated that in many ways, reality is my teacher. Everything that happens to reflects higher aspects of your Self comnunicating to you. They asked me if I remembered what they told me a long time ago, and I replied that I didn't tenember. They reminded me of the experience that I had where I was taken aboard a specific Sirian vehicle for three days way back in the 1970's. When I returned back from this, I expressed to these higher entities my opinion that the Sirians were really advanced because their technology had no moving parts - it was all based on shape. All their instruments looked more like art objects. The higher entities reprimanded me, saying, 'no, you do not understand. The more technologically advanced a civilization becomes, the weaker they become, and they become more separated f ran the Creator.\" I said \"what do you mean?\". They gave me an example that if you create a heating device to heat a roan, you have just becane weaker. You have just thrown off your innate ability to heat that roan yourself and have given it to an object, and now you need the object. So, as society gets more sophisticated it becomes weaker until it depends on the technology and can do nothing for itself anymore. They said that the most advanced civi7izations in the galaxy have nothing outside of thamse7ves. They can do anything they want and require no physical thing to do it. So, at that tine I listened to all of this and then forgot what they said. Later, I became involved in electronics with all these scientists, trying to do all these things. At one stage, we learned how to create the Uerkabah externally through electronics, which was what all these other experiments were doing. After I realized this and remembered this, I realized what I had been doing. This is when they told me about the Lucifer Rebellion and what had happened in the beginning with all of this. Anyway, this is why I am not involved with electronics - I dropped it all, because now my belief is that you need to get your understanding centered so that it doesn't get in the way. If you create an instrument to heal, you must also learn how to do that yourself. At this point, my understanding is that the Merkabah will do anything on any level - a living breathing one. There is no limitation at all. I am sticking with how to do this from within oneself. It is what Jesus was doing. Haw quickly you can master these techniques depends on your past, what work you have done, what you can accept, what your belief patterns are (belief patterns have to be broken down). When you leave this workshop you will know what to do. Since everything to do with this upcaning change is, in a sense, a1 ready completed, you real 1 y don't need to feel rushed. You have plenty of time for everything. There is perfect timing. The Lucifer Rebellion Lucifer, if you remember in the Bible, was the greatest creation that God had made. He was the most beautiful and intelligent being created. He was the leader of the angelic realms and a being of light. At one point he felt that he could ascend to the heights of beingness without the realization of the Creator. As you will soon realize, the Uerkabah is the image that all things are created through. If you know the image, then there was a possibility that"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"instead of creating the Merkabah through thought and feeling (which connects you to the Creator), you could create it synthetically and externally and get into it (essentially a mechanical spacecraft) and ascend into the heights; this external process does not require the use of love. It just requires knowledge. In so doing, this being the fourth time this has apparently happened in this universe, the external Merkabah was created. Lucifer convinced a lot of others that they should try this, and it was done several hundred thousand years ago. So, there are two ways to do this. You can do it as a living being through love, which connects you to a11 1 ife, or you can separate yourself from life, make your own little flying craft and go roaming around without any love. What happens is that you eventually becane devoid of emotion - just like the Greys. You have no feelings and no love. There is one understanding that Lucifer did not realize. That kind of external process has a limitation on how 'high' it can ascend in dimension, because the way that the Creator created the star-gates (through which you can pass between suns to go from place to place) require emotions in order to go through them (on the higher dimensional levels). So, there are limits in .the use of external uses of this Uerkabah that trap the people who do it. There being free will, the consciousness of the Creator did not place any barrier to Lucifer in doing this. Now, the situation on Mars a million years ago was the end result of the previous rebel 1 ion, so the race on Hars had developed to the point where they had no emotion or love. They were entirely logic based and destroyed their planet because they had no canpassion or love for each other. They just fought, and the third rebellion caused a lot of dest~~tion of many races. When the race on Hars projected itself through time and cane into the vortices in Atlantis, they brought that sickness to Earth. The Greys are connected to the rebellion. .The race on Hars is also related to the Greys, in that they are one of the parent races to them. They are all in the process of dying out for the same reasons, which keeps repeating itself. They cannot get out of here and go to the next octave of existence because they do not know haw to love. The Greys are now aware of this; they understand logically that they need to know the concept of love, but they don't know how to do it. The Greys started cloning themselves and not having physical sexual contact, which is an aspect that generates and continues love. They lost their ability to procreate and make use of sexual energy. This is the reason that they did all the research on cattle, cats, dogs and horses. These type of animals that were around humans were breathing the same way huaans breathe. They were mostly cutting out the sexual organs and the breathing apparatus of the animals, trying to analyze the concept of sexual energy and emotion frun a position of pure logic. They were also doing that with human beings - a lot of sexual experiments and genetic work with humans in attempts to produce a genetic cross-breed that would carry their genetic infonnation through into the dimensional changes to come, since the parent race of the Greys themselves cannot make the dimensional shift. In a way, the universe allowed them to do this because we have similar genetic stm~ture to the Greys because of the Hars infusion at the time of Atlantis. There are about five other races that have been helping them in this process, and many of the species that are around Earth at this time have been involved in an effort to make sure that the human race does not get hurt during this process. This has produced much factionalitation within different groups of aliens on, in and around the- Earth. Hany species are from other dimensional levels and are trying to make sure that the Greys do not overstep their bounds while this process is happening. They have tried to overstep their bounds; there was one time when"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV they decided that they were going to wipe the human species out of existence and start over again. They almost succeeded. They had a plan to try and open the 4th dimensional interface quickly, which would have blown humans away (it would not have been the gradual organic process that is now happening naturally). They created a grid around the Earth to do this, and they were going to open up a dimensional window. When you open up a dimensional window, the window works both ways. In order to make sure that more evolved beings didn't interfere with the Greys while they were going to do this, they made the size of the window infinitely small and made the grid open randomly all over the planet. The more advanced species, using love, intuitively knew what the randan pattern would be and when the window opened up, love was projected back at them. After that, the Greys were absolutely silent for three months. This happened around 1989, and it was their last chance. They knew that the human mass consciousness on the planet was about ready to gain control of what you could call the \"dreetime' of the planet, which is what that wanan from Peru did when she raised the ship up. At that point, we wuld be in control and they would not be in absolute control any nore. An analogy to this was hinted at in the material in the Bible, where in effect what Jesus was trying to say was \"do not resist evi 7 - instead project into the positive - create what needs to be created rather than trying to stop what you do not want to be created.\" The vast majority of species around Earth do not use external mechanical \"UFOs\". A Merkabah based upon a living process is not visible to human eyes. It is rotating at extreme speeds and it is pure light. What is now going on in the 3rd dimension is that you have all kinds of beings on all kinds of levels that are preparing different ways to go through the process of the upcaning 4th dimensional interface. Most of those species who have literal physical craft using external Werkabah processes are part of the scwalled Lucifer Rebellion. A ship using the internally generated Clerkabah requires a living process to operate it. What you have is all kinds of beings in all kinds of levels trying to get out of this situation in different ways. Sane of the races that are here at this time have learned about the concepts of canpassion and love - many of them have been involved at one time or another with \"Lucifer thought'. We are too. We are an aspect of this thought pattern. Viewpoints that view various species as 'good' or 'bad' are simply an aspect of human interpretation of polarity-consciousness reality. From a higher level that is beyond all of this, it is just an organic process going on that has what appears to be \"good\" and 'bad' aspects to it that is leading somewhere, and that 'sanewhere\" is rather remarkable. The galaxy is like a body with many cells, and there is a disease going through the body called the \"lucifer rebellion', and this disease is in the process of being healed; from another point of view the solution has already happened and it has been healed. From even another perspective there are no 'good guys\" or 'bad guys\" - everybody has thespirit of the Universal Intelligent Matrix within them. With the Grays, they have been around in that left-brained fonn for so long that it has not worked very well at all. Their species as a life fonn or (container) is going to have to be 'junked' because it can no longer evolve. It is an ancient life fonn, and now that we are coming to this particular juncture in evolution that the Grays never really understood or knew about, that life fonn cannot make the jump to the next evolutionary level of development.

The Grays were originally created as humanoid life forms that resembled humans. Uetatron's Cube Moving Through the Flower of Life Pattern Examine the above pattern. It is Metatron's Cube moving through the flower of life pattern. Metatron was historically one of the 24 elders that sane call the Ancients of Days, and was the one who envisioned the sphere in the Great Void in which this universe was created. When he did, he picked a spot and set Metatron's Cube in it, which put out a lattice structure that went everywhere in all levels of existence. No matter where you go in life, there is this precise crystalline energy lattice that moves through everything. It appears as though it is the only thing that is not moving - everything moves through it. The Man energy lattice parallels this other universally present grjd, and this presents the possibility that if you know haw to tune to Mefatroll's grid, you will have all the infomation available in existence. In sum of the Egyptian temples were found 24-spoked wheels depicted on the walls. These wheels contained an inner circle, and the circle was exactly nine diameters wide. In examining the diagram above you will see that there are nine diameters across the figure, and just within the large circle there are 24 small circles that are connected in a hexagonal pattern. If you started at the center and connected lines to each of those smaller circles, you would have the exact pattern found in the Egyptian temples. That is where they extracted than frola. We know that this pattern is related (from previous discussion) to hamics of light and sound. The Egyptian patterns are not concerned so much with the ham- onics of sound, but the hannonics of dimensions and other worlds. The wheels"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV were found in either sets of four or sets of eight, which also relates to harmonics. These Egyptian drawings represented, as best as can be ascertain- ed, where they went dimensionally. Drawings on walls near the wheels show the initiates walking along, making a 90-degree turn, and proceeding into the wheels above. They definitely knew what they &re doing, and it proves that they had the understanding behind their achievements, which are clearly documented on the temple walls. Classical Egyptian archaeologists kncm nothing regarding these wheels. The I4orphological Structure of the Eye and Electromanetic Field Structure of Liaht The drawing above represents both the morphological structure of a1 1 eyes, as well as the electra~lclgnetic field structure of light relative to the master pattern. The vertical vesica piscis is the female aspect and the vertdcal dia- mond shape is the male aspect. Study the relationships of the horizontal and vertical vesica piscis. There are my vesica piscis which are not shown, but all vesica piscis relate to each other in 90-degree shifts. You will notice sane equilateral triangles as well, as these actually reflect three-dimensional tetrahedrons. Two three-dimensional tetrahedrons sitting flat will also fom a vesica piscis shape between them. Ualcolm Uilliwhite, one of the world experts on light, has undertaken a research program on eyes - all kinds of eyes, and had put them in six different categories; after a great deal of study, they came up with this sane drawing as the structure that is behind all eyes. If you .wish to take the science of Iridology to a whole new level, you may superimpose the above drawing over Iridology charts.

There are logarittunic spirals that move along with the rotating fields at the scrae the. The light field itself and the eye that receives it are based on the same pattern. Plant leaves are also a receiver of light, and the geanetry likewise follows suit.

There are three primary balance points that are &ed on musical octaves; each primary balance point is the middle of each group of 8 vertebrae. The middle balance point also relates to the chmmatic scale, in terms of 8-8-8 and 12. If you take the vertebrae of hunan beings and you weigh them, the weight differences between them correspond precisely to the harmonics of music. The harmonics of music exactly correlate to the human spine. Again, it is another relationship between sound and organic structure. Acoustic Brain Research is a company which does research into sound and physiological processes. They have a tape of music according to musical fifths which is highly resonant to the spine ('Wave Fonn', available fran Quantum Link, 8665 East Miami River Rd, Cinncinnati , Ohio 45247, 513-353-1452). The Wavefom tape has the capability of opening the heart chakra, and has produced my amazing experiences with people. The cost of the tape is around $20. The sound is repeated in a spiral pattern which is quite interesting. Stereogramic Vision and Hemispheric Synchronization In all the locations where the Atlanteans went after the continent sank, all the religions and priesthoods that developed in those locations always sd to have one -11 group who were different - they were slightly cross-eyed. They were not born that way - they were trained to be that way. Historians have always wondered what this aeant. Recently, science! has revealed a 'new' way of seeing called stereogr~~llll~ic vision. A lot of the drawings on the walls in these temple areas were created in such a way that if you look at them in this way, they jump out threedimensionally into space according to the Phi ratio. These religious groups maintained the 'cross-eyed' sects in order to guide the production of this type of art work. Viewing in this way causes both sides of the brain to operate simultaneously, as one side counts levels of the dimensions that the other side sees. Study the stereogram illustration. Unlike hms, dolphins use both side of their brain continuously, exce!pt when they sleep. When dolphins sleep, they form into a circle on the surface with their noses pointing tarard each other and start wing sideways in a wheel-like manner while reanaining in the same relative position. At one point, one dolphin shuts down one side of its brain, and while remaining in its position, descends deeper into the water in a spiral. Other dolphins soon follow, and at a particular depth they start caning up (switching sides of their brain again) while others are caning dawn. It looks sort of like a MU spiral under the water. Reports indicate that dolphins viw hamans as being asleep, since humans usually use only one side of the brain at a time, and only a small portion of the brain is active. To saae species, hums are both asleep and unconscious."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Stereogram Relax and allow your eyes slightly until the two dots becane three.

They are also related in tenns of the hrraan energy systems known as the chakra system. There are three drakra energy systems associated with the human body, one below the usual chakra system and one above. The system below the usual chakra system reflects the consciousness system that proceeded the one we are in now, and the one above the body reflects the consciousness system we are moving to - the next level of consciousness. The first two chakra systems are in Phi ratio to the one above it. The energy system below the usual chakra system is very short, and the chakra system above the body is fairly long. This fact also reflects the physical height differences that are allied with DNA camposi tion and consciousness level (42+2 ,44+2,46+2). Chakras could be considered to be 'lenses' through which reality is interpreted. All the chakras are separated by 7.23 an, which is the wavelength of this universe. We will examine this later, and it involves a topographical measurement over the surface of the body. Speaking about the regular chakra systen, when a new spi tit cones into the world, it enters through the first chakra (which is the 8th chakra in the 42+2 consciousness system below) and its whole concern is to be able to stay in the new world it has arrived in. Survival is its amin focus. After it has decided that staying in the new world is no longer a concern, the next thing that it wants to do is make physical contact with the beings in that world, and we call this process sex. Once it has done this, it concerns itself with the next area of energy, which is at the navel. Many Hindu and Tibetan texts tell us that this chakra is one or two fingers below the navel. There is nothing there. It is exactly behind the navel. This third area is concerned with will and control, which relates to the desire to master the fabric of the reality. There is a 'wall' of sorts at this point, so individuals are forced to remain in these areas until they are mastered. This relationship can be analogous to how planets or cwntries develop. In the United States in the 1950's everybody was concerned with survival, sex and control. It was also when the DLLSS media was born, and it continues to strive to force people to focus in these areas. If you exmine older countries, like China or India, the focus is in the higher energy centers. In the 19601s, the age of psychedelics changed that focus for millions of people. It threw my people through that doorway. Mediation and other disciplines will do this. The psychedelics made chakras 4,5,6, and 7 available before they hit another 'wall'. When people did this in the 19601s, if they entered the 4th hkra first, they essentially 'became all things' and understood the essential oneness of the universe. That experience changed a lot of people in society. Many people left on the sound currents of nusic, and that was an entirely different experience that is concerned with the 5th center. Sane went into the 6th center, where a1 1 the geometry is held at this level, and saw all these geonaetrical images and had no idea what it all meant, because they were 'babies' in a world they didn't understand. Hardly anyone went into the 7th center at the pineal gland. Once a person, country or planet gets through the first 'gate' and finds out about the higher levels, they are never happy in the first three levels (unless fear is so -great that is throws them back and slams the door shut). Most of the efforts of the mass media and the controlling elements of society work very hard to keep the population in these first three levels."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"The energy center at the back of the head is the key. It is the doonay that is involved with the 9U-degree shift (two 45-degree shifts), and it is the same point that was stimulated with the hannonic rods of the Egyptians. 6 Gateway -> o It is required for a being that accesses the 6th dimension to figure out where the 7th dimension is located. There are seven or eight thousand 'ascended masters', and they are sitting on the loth, 11th and 12th overtones of the 6th dimension. Only three or four have figured out haw to even get to the 7th. That's changing right now, and they are going though a major revelation. They are going though in groups of 32 as fast as they can. They fom a group Merkaba and bring their consciousness to the gateway, pull a 45aegree shift and then another 45-degree shift to the 8th. This puts them in another universal octave on a planetary level. As far as the EarUl is concerned, we are going to go into the 4th dimension, but it is suspected that it wi 11 be only for about tn, or three years. At that point a major transformation will occur. It has never happened in this way before on a planetary scale. It doesn't man much to you now, but we will let more of this unfold. The Tm Energy Center Systm The usual nunber of chakms on a cultural map really only represent the 'white notes' of the scale. There are also five 'black notes'. There are really 12 points, and one above the head mke 13. There are five points at each center, making a total of 60 energy centers in 5 groups of 12. Each of the groups of 5 is separated fraa the next one by 7.23 ca and a rotation of 904egrees, precisely like the light patterns you saw in the diagrap of the norpClologica1 structure of the eye. There are five centers at the base of the spine. If you are looking under- neath a hmn body, you will find the perinern in both the male and fmle. It is between the anus and the genital organs. There is a tube in there that runs a1 1 the way to the top of the head at the location of where the 'soft spot' is in a baby. The tube is approximately 1.25 inches in diameter. It's absolutely straight . If you look at the classical diagram of the chakras, you see one chakm in each position. This is not the case. There are really five points at each of these areas, and five separate paths to raise Kundal ini energy. The whole system is much more complex."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"-.

Fran the top it looks like + , and from the side it looks like . A Christian symbol for Christ that takes all into account is the one shaped like All four of these symbols are inter-related, but according to the Egyptians, the field shaped like the Ankh was most important. They felt that if the Kundalini energy, whether it is derived through meditation or sexual energy, was sent straight up or straight down, that it would be lost forever and you will have died a little bit. There is Hindu thought around this concept as well. The Egyptians would sent the energy up the spine in one of the five channels, and when it got to the 5th center, they would arc it out through the back and over the head and back to the same place - thus the arc shape of the top of the Ankh. The Egyptians felt they lost no energy this way, and this is what is behind the Ankh as a symbol for imnortality. The Egyptians had a vast Tantra and Kunda- lini science - a science more vast that any other system. It is incredibly canplex. On the subject of re-incarnation, the Hindu thought pattern is that you die and you come back in a different body in a different time, and that there was this sine-uave curve of one person. When the Egyptians talked about the subject, they said that there are eight of you (the eight original cells, the eight electrical circuits in the body, and the associations with the eight points on the star tetrahedron). Depending on which one of your eight faces was forward on the tetrahedron, you would have one of those eight personalities. As you re-incarnated, the tetrahedron would rotate. There were four female and four amle personalities, and each of these eight personalities had in turn eight sexual polarities. It was a caaplex systera, but it corresponds with the I Ching exactly. In the I Ching, there is the mother, father, three sons and three daughters. There were 64 changes in the I Ching. The whole system of information in the Chinese I Ching correlates exactly with the systems of Egypt. All of this is just for informational purposes. Since the human body is surrounded by a star-tetrahedron field with eight points, those eight points also hold chakra points, You have internal and ex- ternal chakra energy points or nodes, and the internal ones are identical to the external ones. The major eight internal nodes are the ones usually reflected on chakra energy charts. All the chakra systeas are pulsing together. The external nodes have very small centers."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Tetrahedronal Fields Around the Body The tetrahedronal fields around the body are in the form of two inter-locked tetrahedrons, .one pointing up (male polarity) and one pointing dam (female polarity).

Seen from above, male on the left and female on the right: If you are sitting dawn on the ground , the female polarity field goes into the ground. If you a6 standing, a Gall portion about the length of your hand extends into the ground. When sitting on the ground, half of each field is em- bedded in the ground. This is why the lnost ideal position for meditative work in consciousness is to be sitting on the earth. If you lay dam, the whole field pattern rotates with you. On sane of the Egyptian walls, priests are seen wearing a pleated apron with the point fonard. and this no doubt represented the male field of the tetra- hed ron . If you stand and extend your hands straight out fran the sides of your body, it is exactly the size of one of the faces of your tetrahedronal field. Hmns that have a hanosexual orientation have their fields rotated to that of the opposite sex. Field readjustment results in readjustment of sexual orientation.

In the July 1991 issue of Scientific American, they describe their under- standing of the creational processed behind stars. When a nebula explodes, it forms a huge hydrogen cloud, in which soine gas congeals into what they call a proto-star. Spheres form around that, and the whole thing begins to rotate with an exis dm the middle. It then pops out into a disc shape. The process of the creation of a star follows the Merkaba pattern precisely. The disc compresses under it becomes a star, and the outer rim becomes a series of planets. Alien Intrusions and Neutral Parties Is it any wonder that the flying craft of the Lucifer Rebell ion are shaped like a disc? The so-called Pleiadians of Billy Ueier are not positively oriented Pleiadians, but they are connected with the Grays. Their overall intentions for the hunan species are not clear. Fran an examination of the Meier transcripts, it is easy to see that the 'Pleiadian' society he is in contact with functions within a master-slave domination base on a higher level. When the Lucifer rebellion occured, you had a polarity split as well as sides that were neutral. That is what these beings did, is that they fonned a neutral faction who rode the fence, and are 'fence-riders' who align politically with whomever will aid their agenda. Meier is not aware of these aspects of the Semajase group. They know lwe and understand it, but they are at the manent working on the side of the Grays, whose operations (along with Reptilian factions) are not in the best interests of the hman species. The Geanetry Behind the 'Lucifer Rebellion' It is important to understand what was behind the so-called 'Lucifer Rebellion and why the being cal1,ed 'Lucifer' did what he did, and what the logic behind it was. According to a1 1 that can be determined, Lucifer info- other beings in the angelic realms that there was sane 'missing information', and that information had to do with determining the sphere size that would fit into the opening between the spheres in the egg of life, as well as the size of the sphere that would fit in the middle and touch all eight. There are two ways to come out of the Great Void. One is to do like we did, to come up and rotate around in a vortex, which creates the Flower of Life and everything that we are familiar with. If you go back to the proverbial Garden of E*Din, there were two trees. One was the Tree of Life that led to inmrtality, and the other was the Tree of the Knowledge of 'good' and 'evil'. It wasn't that knowledge was bad, it was the knowledge of 'good' and 'evil' that was not permitted. The knowledge of 'good' and 'evil' was achieved by a different mve- ment of the Spirit out of the Great Void - a moment that split it into two parts, which is possible (it is possible to split into many more parts than two)."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Above is a geanetrical representation of that split.

Lucifer convinced a lot of beings that we needed to know this, because fnn the knowledge of this the external Merkaba can be created and the experiences that went with it. The Earth was part of the rebellion. The being called Satan, who was an actual person, controlled a sector of space in which Earth was located, and he bought into it as well. The external Merkaba separates beings fnn the Creator and Life. The internal Merkabah requires love and connects you to Life and the Creator. In a free will universe you can do whatever you want, and those who did this were allowed to do it. Relative to the discussion in Hurtak's \"Keys of Enoch\" about the concept of the Merkabah, Hurtak talks about the di-polar and tri-polar Werkeba. What we are considering here is the first phase of the di-polar Werkeba. The tri-polar phase relates to a group Merkaba where an even larger Merkebah is generated. At the right ti-, that will be taught. Without love, you cannot get through the dimensional octaves very far at a1 1. No one has ever been able to do it. Talk to the Grays, they have tried and they couldn't do it, and mw they are trying to save a -little bit of themselves. They are locked into a huge universe, and universes grow old and you must move on. It takes love to move on, and they don't have it. They know they are trapped; they are in a universal aspect of things that is changing, and they can't go along with the change; that change is really big. The Earth and Recent Times This is all so fantastic - it's all so outrageous on some levels- if it's too much for you to accept, don't - let it go, but I've got to tell you what I have been told and what I see. This is on Star Trek levels, yet it supposed to be what is really happening. You have to go way back in time to when they were setting up this grid around the Earth - the synthetic grid of Christ Consciousness - trying to heal what happened in Atlantis with the nartian race. When they created the grid and made the hole Egypt about a mile from Ule pyramids that connected in with the flame of life and the halls of Anenti and started setting these geanrantic points all aver the world to create the basis for the grid, it was orginally calculated that by the winter of 1998 we would go thrwgh into this next step. At that time it was assessed that only a very few people would make it through the process. This is nothing unusual - it's been tried before lots of times - where if a planet is on sane level -re it is getting out of phase or crazy, that they lnay j~plp them up or dm, but they may change the level of consciousness that the planet is on to either start them over again (which is what happened to the Hebrews when they infused with our consciousness during Atlantean times) or send them ahead. This aspect of the experilnent is not unusual at a1 1, and did not attract much attention at all. Haever, about 200 years ago the Sirians (the father aspect of our race) became aware that there was a very high possibility that we were not going to mke it; this possibility does occur. In this case, it.was becoming obvious that there was a..problem happening. They knew that there was q- event that wwld occur in 1972 and that we had to be on a certain level of awareness for there to be no problem. It appeared at that time that we were not going to make it to that specific level of awareness by 1972 - if we didn't make it, there wwld not"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV even be a bug alive on the planet. They did not want to see that happen - especially the Sirians, because we were their children, in a way. They started searching for an answer for this particular situation, which I will later describe. There was no answer, nothing was knwn that would get a planet of wr level of awareness through to the other side of this problem intact. When this happened in the past, it mant that the planet was gone. Life continued on. The Sirians, in seeing that this may happen, kept on looking - eventually they fwnd something that had been done in another galaxy where sanebody had conceived of an idea that night work - a possibility - but it had never been tried before. At that tine, the possibility that we might make it through still existed. But they were naw assubing that we would not make it. They created everything that was necessary to perfom this action so that in case we were not going to make it, they could initiate this process, which was . a further experiment. They created living vehicle that was very large- 50 miles long, black, cigar-shaped and seamless. It had life forms on it that consisted of carbon and silicon merged into one. The whole thing was a self-aware living unit. It had a transparent area on one end, and it was manned by about 300 men and wanen from the white Sirian race fran the third planet of their system. They worn white uniforms with gold-colored emblems. They dedicated as much time of their lives to this project as was necessary. They also made eight small saucer-shaped unmanned vehicles as part of the project. These were twelve to twenty feet in diameter. They got all this stuff together and just waited. Now, what was going on on this dimension: I was led to Canada. The reason they sent me to Canada was that I had to connect with a rurn named David Suzuki. David Suzuki is a highly disciplined person tho has won the Nobel prize in genetics. He won the Nobel prize in genetics not by looking through his laicroscope. He won it by looking through a telescope. He believed 'as above, so belw'. He had all these peaple hired to watch the movement of asteroids, and fran what was discovered frola the movement of asteroids, he applied that to genetics and won the Nobel prize. One of the things he had going was that he had a tern of people who watched the Sun - all the time. One day in 1950, they noticed a phenomenon on the Sun that had never been recorded before in hunan experience. They witnessed a spiralling light that came off the Sun and went past the Earth very rapidly. They did not know what it was - it did not fit into anything Ulat science was aware of. That was the first indication that sanething unusual was occurring with the Sun. In reference to the axis of the Earth, there is sanething called the precession of. the equinoxes, which is a slow 26,000 wobble. There is another one that has a 46,000 year cycle, which is the inclination rocking back and forth. There is another little tiny one called the Chandler wobble. It happens every 14 months and is about 42 feet. However, they were talking about a wobble that happens every 14 years. I don't know of one like that, but there is one that has been talked about, a smaller orbit wobble, that sane people say is there, but astronomers have not figured it out. I am unclear on this - what Suzuki was talking about. What he said was that we were on the furthemt point of this wobble in 1950 and that when the spiral passed the Earth, the area of the wobble began to open - which is equivalent to a top slowing down. I think until I know more about the data, I won't give you all the dates that they gave me. I am going to check it more. There are certain dates I know for sure. It took-Suzuki 14 years of study before they concluded that this wobble was going to lead to a situation where Earth would have a new north and south pole - a axis shift would occur. This guy was not into Edgar Cayce or anyone else. He"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV was a pure scientist. Cayce predicted that it would go 16 degrees in this particular place in the USSR (CIS). Suzuki's team put it to 15.75 degrees not very far away from where Cayce said it would be. By 1964, they were pretty , certain about this. They spend four more years (1968) of studying the data before they acted. By 1968, they were absolutely convinced that this was going to happen. Suzuki published a paper that was first sent to the Canadian government, then under Trudeau, and then to the United States and other major govemntts of the world, that we were going to have a new north and south pole. He put in the paper that this solar spiral was coming off the Sun every three years like clockwork, and it was increasing in intensity each time. From all their calculations over an 18 year period, they had caee up with the conclusion that by the period between August and November. of 1972 the energy level would be such that there would be an explosion on the Sun that wwrd be absolutely unparallel led with anything we had ever knwnz. before, and that there would be another one during the winter of 1984, and that after that one we would have an axis shift. The actual event happened on August 7, 1972. From our observation of it (now, the Sirians intervened in between here), what we saw was still the biggest thing we've ever seen. The solar wind got up to 2.5 million miles per hour for three days. It dropped down to 1.5 million miles per hour for 30 days there- after. It was incredible. It was then published in all the major scientific publications of the world and in all the major newspapers. They published the data, but they didn't know what it meant as far as this event having occurred. After six months David Suzuki called a worldwide scientific meeting to discuss what this meant. Once the meeting happened in June/July of 1973, there was a total blackout. of information about the solar explosions. It was no longer discussed in public. If the Sirians had not intervened, the explosion wwld have killed us. Our scientists think that 'baby suns' like ours are pretty stable, and that we have at least five billion years of life left in the sun. What was happening was that the solar explosions were preparatory to what is called a red-giant pulse. Our sun was about to expand out as far as Jupiter for a period of tine, possibly as long as a thousand years. If we were prepared for this in consciousness, it would have been no problem. We could tune our frequency to it. Because the life on earth is fairly low in consciousness, we would not have been able to protect ourselves from this pulse. Uhat was going on in other dimensional levels as a result of this realization, as early as January of 1972, was that about 80,000 of the cultural groups that were here had an intense discussion over this problem. Almost all of the groups decided that there was no hope for the Earth and left. The Sirians, hawever convinced many of the groups that there was a course of action that would alter the situation so that Earth would survive this solar pulse. No only did they have the 'hardware' and 'software' to do this, but they had ambassadors already to depart to Galactic Conmand as soon as the majority declared that Earth could not be spared fran this event. Permission was obtained to do an experiment on Earth. Within 30 days they had everything set up and turned on. They placed the large black cigar-shaped object just outside the membrane of consciwsness of the Earth, which is 440,000 miles out, one overtone higher that the dimension on which the Earth resides. Around the Earth there is a tetrahedonal field (and NASA has verified this). The eight small ships-were placed around the Earth on the apexes of the'tetrahedonal field points (also on overtone higher) and shot in a beam of light about eight inches in diameter which consisted of segnented digital information which appeared like"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"different colors of light. It entered in at one of the poles and hit one of the ships in space and irrnediately reflected to all the other ones, translated into three primary rays (red,blue,green) which were then shot into the center of the Earth - this then came out all over the entire planet in a spherical wavefront. The energy connected with a1 1 1 ifeforms. on the Earth. What they were doing was they had to protect us frua a wall of flame. They also had to speed up wr evolution so we could get to the point where we could handle the wall of flame. They set up a holographic field around the planet and around every 1 ifeforn and then began to progrm these fields with events. In the first few months, they did not change anything. Then, for a short time, they essentially took away free will. They programmed everything so that everything would appear to be nomal in appearance. Once they knew it was working, they then began to program the events in people's lives so that people moved as rapidly as possible in evolution, so that the events in people's lives were ones that would awaken them. In the beginning, they determined what those events would be. Once people reached a certain level, they put free will back in and .gave you a selection. If in- ppropriate choices were made, they just kept on giving you the same selection of events or choices. The program was much more successful than ever dreamed. As of 1992 probably 1.5 billion people have 'made it through' into the other levels. Time was also required to complete the unity-consciousness grid around the Earth, which was campleted in 1989, so the jump to the 4th dimension could be laade. The geometry of the grid parallels changes in planetary consciousness, and is changing on an hourly basis. That has attracted the attention of everyone everywhere. Now, Earth is an interdimensional object of study. The effect of the attention focused on Earth is also having an effect, The speed at' which we are now evolving is incredible. The reason that so many races are interested in what is happening on Earth at this time is because they knaw that if it happens here, it will affect all life everywhere. People now suspect that this experiment, which had apparently not been tried before, was in the mind of God fran the very beginning. All we know is that there is no memory pattern on any level that knaws anything about this - it is unique and really big. Originally, in 1989, Thoth ctme in and stated that we were going to reach critical mas in the last week of August 1990. Usually when a planet reaches a certain nunher of people, the whole pl'anet goes into Christ Consciousness. We were told that the planet would reach this point in the last week of August 1990 or the first week of SeptwJber 1990 and that by the spring we should be going into another dimensional level. When they began to approach that ti-, they said, they said they were going to leave the Earth in a ball of light, which would have the side effect of pulling us all up with the ascended rasters as they went. What happened, houever, in August 1990 was George Bush declared war on Iraq and Saddam Hussei n, and the whole planet did bond together, . but in a polari za- tion against one man. Nothing like that has occurred before. Because of this event, the ascended masters held off fraa implementing the process at that time. So, the planet banded together and the war started January 15, 1991, right in the middle of the window where the dimensional shift cwld have happened. It was then that Thoth and company realized that we were not. doing it - we almost did it in one way - almost created total unity. By Hay 1991, theyaswitched and tried another scenario."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The one they are now using, which is the one that they are apparently going to stick with, it that Thoth and 31 other masters went off in a group Merkabah. Other groups of 32 are leaving. They estimate that this process will jack the consciousness of the planet up in a stair-step fashion. We are not going to go through a super-violent shifting of the poles, but a controlled situation. All the predictions that have been made before , Thoth feels are invalid. After 1972, Nostrodmus* predictions fell off. So did those of Cayce. The predictions of David Suzuki for 1984 also fell off because of the actions of the Sirians in 1972. What Thoth believes is that we are going to have a really unique experience, and that before the end of the century, every last person on the planet is going to go together. We all are. There will be dying, but they will go into the other levels by resurrection. Those who are left over will do it consciously, as though we were a mi 1 lion years down the 1 ine in consciousness. A1 1 the higher aspects of life are begging to cane down to this level to experience this change. It does appear that we have made it in a really big way. We are going to find ourselves very soon not just in the 4th dimension, which is the first step, but as I understand it we are going to just keep right on going up. If the Mayan calendar is right, by the year 2012 we skip octaves - whole universal octaves. The Secret Government's Role in All of This Sane time back in the 1930's and possibly as far back as shortly after 1900, the Greys made contact with our government. Originally it was thought that the first contact was in the 1940's or 'SO'S, but it has becase increasingly clear that contact was much earlier. The secret government controls everything on the planet. When they started the Philadelphia experiment, Tesla stated that he was getting infonnation f ran extraterrestrials. In the beginning, the govemnent thought that the Greys were good, and traded permission for the Greys to interact with wr society for gains in technology. In 1968 when David Suzuki told the world that we were about to be fad with new poles, the hman side of the secret government decided to leave. By about 1970, the US and USSR were joined together , and they started using technology to further their aims. Our government is so far advanced in technology, you would not believe it. This is what was going on, although the scenario is changing right now. They used a1 1 their resources and created vehicles which would insure that they could leave the planet. They thought that they had about 14 years left. They went to the moon and built three -11 daned cities on the far side of the moon. Most people would say that we've been to the moon six times, but the records indicate that we have been there over 2,000 tines. Once they got enough materials bui lt up on the moon, they went to Mars and bui lt an extremely complex underground city. Before 1984 they had most of it together and ready. Around 1989, they made a shocking discovery, in that all the planets would have a pole shift during this period. Shortly thereafter, they also understood that the change would involve consciousness and an inter-dimensional change. At this point they felt pretty helpless."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV At this point, the people ultimately in control of this society are beginning to have a realization that they can't make it through this on their own, so they are leaving people who they think might have answers to their survival relatively alone. These people pretty much have no emotions - they're really logical and intelligent. NASA doesn't want us to know about Mars. They have tried to suppress anything about that. They tried to stop Richard Hoagland from releasing his data, but he is too well known. When he first wanted to present his data at NASA, they would not allow him to do it until he said he had made contact with ABC television - then they allowed him to it. They did not want it on ABC because they do not want the public to focus on Mars. We've got too much up there. At this point, it's all changing, although if they could figure out a way to save th-lves without saving us they would do it. They are now realizing that everyone must survive and go on through this dimensional change. Eventually there won't even be a government. We only need govemnt in polarity consciousness. If yw are in unity consciousness, it is spirit that guides you. Consider the idea of not resisting what you perceive to be evil - if yw resist you give it power - to do otherwise gives you power. The higher levels of what these guys are doing or not doing is not going to make any difference if you leave and go into another world. It is not going to make any difference. There is not much they can do about it anyway. All you can do is keep working on the positive and not try to resist and stop what yw perceive to be negative. This kind of stuff might have people screaming in the streets if it becanoe public knowledge. At this point, yw almost have to live a double life. Yw have to pay your bills, do your job, etc., as though nothing is going to happen; at the srre time you have to inwardly prepare for this. The idea of building underground shelters for food are not sing to do much either, any more than trying to get off the planet. It would not hurt to have food, but it's not going to 'save' you. It is who you are, ywr character and what you are doing that is going to matter. As far as the Greys are concerned, their existence on this planet is caaing to a close. If there were any left by the end of 1993 I would be surprised. They cannot make this 4th dimensional shift - this is why they have been doing every- hing they have been doing - in an effort to find a way around this fact in order to preserve their species. This dimensional change is going to be a lot easier than everyone probably suspects. The experiaent on Earth relative to this upcaning dimensional shift has really affected everything. What 'normally' occurs in these kind of trans formations - it may not happen exactly that way - though it night. We are in the 'end tines of Revelations' of this planet as we now kmn it. The complex on Mars describing the tetrahedron within a sphere was huge for creating a very large Merkebah. That Mekebah was successful. When they tried to duplicate the experiment in Atlantis in order to gain control of the planet, they lost control of the experiment - all the subsequent experiments have been trying to reproduce this external Merkebah, going back and forth in time trying to do this."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Internal and External Werkabah Outwardly the creation that is created by both the internal and external Merkebah appears the same, but the experiential aspect of the person that creates it from the Flower of Life is that he knows that there is one spirit running through everything, whereas the one that creates the world the other way can't see that - he sees everything as polarized - good and bad, up and down, left and right. He can't find the unity running through everything. Individual Creation What we don't often realize is that each one of us creates everything - it's really a relationship between you and god. Every tine you cane out of the Great Void, you create a whole new world. The options once yw are that Great Void are vast. There are other motions out of the Great Void that create different things. This one creates only waveforn universe. You create everything when you cane out yourself- We tend to think that it is the other way around and that it is a1 ready created and that when we are born we are born into it, because that is the way it appears. Fron another point of view, the creation is between you and God from the very beginning. These are philosophical questions that it would be had to prove or solidify. 1 Involvement with External's- At this point there is no reason to become too involved in 'haw it is', 'what it is', or 'what's wrong with it' so much. It is mostly internal work that is necessary here. There is no 'place to go' or 'anything to build' or any other machines. It is an internal process that needs to be refined. There is no reason to have 'fear' about 'what's going on out there'. The Pueblo Indians and the Day of Purification The Pueblo Indians were told that when they cane to the day of purification, which is what we are rapidly approaching (and they knar that they have certain signs to look for), they were to go inside of their buildings and close the windows and not look out. To look out was to see things that might induce fear - that is not going to help. It is much more important to remain calm and centered, remember your fields, and trust and stay in love. These words 'love', 'trust' and 'beauty' are so important, and yet when you try to talk about these things, people generally want to know more about 'what to do' - it isn't that - it's 'feelings and centeredness' that are much amre important.,"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Analysis of North American Indian End-Time Stories Harvy Swiftdeer went around and collected the prophetic stories from the Indians around the North herican continent. He sat dm with medicine men and discussed these stories in detail. He looked at them all and took only that which was in cormon with all of th. This whole story emerged. They basically say that we are going fran the 4th to the 5th world, rather than the 3rd to the 4th dimension. That . is because they see the Great Void as a world. They feel that they came fmn within the Earth. They said that it has been three times before when the world got crazy, i~lraoral and polluted, and that they had to leave it and go up into the sky, which they say hardens at one level and they cane out onto a surface. This is the 4th time now that they are ready to leave again on the 'Day of Purification' and go into the 5th world. They claim that caning up right about now in 1992 there will be large groups of people that will die, and these people on some level know they are going to do this. One of these groups, according to the herican Indians, is adventurous and don't want to know where they are going. They talk about those that are left over coming into hamy and fom. They claim that the Earth is actually a 'space ship' (which it could well be considered, once you examine the counter-rotating fields around the Earth, especially if enough people had the focus to manipulate it) and the remaining people take the Earth out of orbit away fm the sun and we fly away to another place with the planet. This is what they say we're going to do. This is a synthesis of Indian claims fm Canada all the way dm to New Mexico and Guatmla. I see it differently, but it my just be a matter of terminology or imagery. Who knows - it may just happen that way. We are approaching a place where whatever we dream is going to happen. What Usually Happens When a Planet Goes Through This Process What usually happens is that when we approach this point in the precession where this change takes place, everything begins to break down - all the social structures,etc begin to dissolve and break down. The key that does it is the magnetic field of the Earth. Which as present-day science realizes may also be the key that enables the axis to shift in the first place through magneto- hydrodynamics, where the magnetic field supports a connection where liquid aspects of the earth's composition become solid. When the field collapses, soae solids become liquid and become slippery. They have demonstrated this in laboratories. The magnetic field and the electromagnetic field are the key. The magnetic field is what we use to interpret who and what we think we are, and also to store our memory with. We need an exterior magnetic field to retain mry. We cannot live without soae fonn of magnetic field. If you .look at major cities all over the world, you will notice that the day before, after and during the full moon there is mre rape and lnurder going on. The reason is that the full moon tends to cause a ripple in the magnetic field of the earth, and this change is enough to take people that are emotionally near the edge over the edge. The magnetic field affects the emotional body."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Imagine a planet where you are at a point on the precession where things are starting to get out of balance. SuddenlyAthe magnetic field of the Earth, over a very short period of time (usually three to six months) starts fluctuating a lot and undulating. What happens is that people start losing it. They go crazy. That is what breaks dorm all the structures of the planet. Without their balance, everything falls apart. The magnetic field will go away entirely for at least three and one half days. Usually you will see a buildup of chaos. Morphological Grid Interactions Every time one person plugs into the consciousness grid, they increase the signal frun the grid. There will come a point where people will just start remembering and start breathing this way. Children will have the least problem. The older yw are the harder it is. The Final Time of Axis Shift and Dimsi onal Interface Hopefully it won't really get crazy out there - if it does, that is where the idea of Amageddon comes in. If you look back through the records, you will see that when the axis shifted in 1400 A.D., in South America, they all started fighting and warring with each other, because their eions got so strong. Hopefully, that won't happen. About five to six hours before the dimensional shift in consciousness, the process (which is usually tied to an axis shift) begins. Axis shifts and shifts in consciousness are usually tied together. In this case, the consciwsness shift may happen before or after the axis shift. Usually they are simultaneous, and usually what happens in this period five or six hours before a diaensional shift is a visual phenomenon. This almost for certain will happen as 3rd and 4th dimension begin to interface, and our consciousness begins to move into 4th dilsensional consciousness and 3rd dimensional msci wsness begins to recede away. When that happens, synthetic manufactured objects which amsist of materials which do not occur naturally on the Earth, begin to disappear over a wide gradient, depending what the materials are. They do not disappear all at once. When the grid of 3rd dimensional consciwsness begins to break chm along with the collapse of the magnetic field, these synthet.ic objects begin to disappear over this five or six hour period. Since axis/conscious/grid changes have happened continously for millions of years, this is why there are few manufactured objects from previous civilizations (some of which have been more advanced than ours).which remain to tell the tale. The fact that objects start to disappear really starts to make people who do not understand what is happening go crazy. That is why it is important to remember this. It is a natural process, and when this starts to happen you should get to a place that is natural, not inside an artificial structure. You want to be out on the earth. This is the reason why very advanced civilizations built structures out of natural materials, like stone. They make it through the"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV dimensional changes and remain there. This is also why at the Taos pueblo, which is 1,400 years old, they are not allowed by tribal law to have anything synthetic in their buildings. They know that when the day of purification comes, .they go in and remain centered. There is another phenomenon that will probably happen. As the dimensional interface occurs, 4th dimensional objects may appear in the 3rd dimensional world. They will be objects that will not seear to fit in anywhere with colors that will boggle your mind. These objects will impact your mind in ways you cannot understand. Since gradual movement through the interface is desired, do not touch any of these objects (to touch one would pull you instantly and full y into the 4th dimension) or look at them. They are nesmerizing, and looking at them will pull you nore rapidly into the 4th. If yw are calm and centered, you will be able to watch a1 1 of this for a time, but not for long. As soon as the magnetic field collapses, your field of view and vision will disappear and you will find yourself in a black void. The 3rd dimnsional Earth, for all intents and purposes, will be gone for you. What happens to most people during this time is that they will fall asleep and start dreaming during this period, which lasts about three to four days. If you want you can just sit there, but realize that whatever you think is going to happen will happen. Realize that you are about to literally go through a kind of 'birth' process into the 4th dimension, and don't worry about it. The process is perfect and natural, but fear is a big problem for hrrnans on a 3rd dimensional level. This appears to be a new process, but it is very very old. You have done it before. At some time during the process you may in fact rernember that you have done it before. The Other Side As the 4th dimensional world comes into perception, light comes back again. You will find yourself in a world the likes of which you have never seen (although you have, but you wi 11 not remember it because your meraory has been erased so many tirnes before). It will feel like a brand new place. All the colors and shapes and the feel of everything will be new. You will be perceptively just like you were when you cane into 3rd dimensional conscious- ness, except that you will be the same size you are now. There are a lot of things that are very similar froln world to world - one of them is the idem of the holy trinity (mother-father-child). As you enter into this brand new place, although you won't understand anything, you are going to see two beings standing there - man and dad; they are going to be very big compared to you. They are ping to be about ten to sixteen feet tall. One will be male and one will be female. These beings have a bond with you and will guide and protect .you during your early formative period in this world. These beings do not have the kind of attac-nt to you that parents on Earth might have had. Frun the very beginning, they know that you are part of the Creator and recognize your divine nature. You will appear just like you are now, though more than likely naked, since any synthetic clothing will not have made it through the shift. You wilf' caae out the other side and be in this incredible reality with these two beings that you sanehow feel this intense love towards, although you won't understand why. Although your physical fonn is exactly the same, the"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV atomic structure in your body will have changed dramatically. Uuch of the denseness of the previous physical structure will have been converted into energy, and the atanic structure will be farther apart than before.

The Many Are Called - Few Are Chosen Scenario In the Bible, Jesus said 'two of you shall be in bed and one of you I shall take'. This speaks of a 'many are called-few are chosen'scenario, which is often what happens, but you can only do so much to help saneone. You will go through this process alone. It will be detemined by your character and who you are. What usually happens is that some people go through and some do not make it through, but there is a third possibility - that someone will have just made it through. Jesus spoke of a parable about the wheat and the chaff as an analogy. The wheat that goes thrwgh had soae weeds with it. Who takes the weeds out? The weeds do. You take yourself out. When you get to the 4th dimensional conscious- ness, most people don't know that you are creating the entire world and every- thing in it second by second by your thoughts and your feelings - every- thing. It is true in the 3rd dimension as well, but it is not realized because we have culturally put all these limitations on ourselves that we can't do anything. There, it's all inclusive and instantaneous. If you are there and you are not really ready for it and you start thinking negative thoughts and fear cones in, you will create a scenario which will result in your being thrown back into a lower dimension. At the same time, the 'wheat' is going through, and sitting there and thinking 'love, truth, beauty, peace and harmony' - and that is what happens. You start manifesting all of it. You become stable in the new reality because of what you are thinking and feeling - your character and who you are. Jesus, referring to this time, said 'if you live by the sword you shall die by the sword' and 'the meek shall inherit the Earth'. Those who are there and not trying to protect, kill or anything else along those lines, but just being and thinking positive thoughts - that is what manifests, and you've just won the 9-• After the entities who are not resonant ('chaff') are gone and the resonant entities ('wheat') remain, one af the first things that begins to happen is that you begin to realize that 'hey, whatever I think happens!'. Usually people look at their bodies in this light and begin to change their appearance to suit whatever idealized image they have in mind - it's a childlike exercise. If you look at some of the non-terrestrial races, they are all tall, beautiful and healthy. The selfinodification of body structure is a natural occurance fram 'the 4th dimension onward. It is a creative expression. After that, other things become more interesting as activities. On Earth in the 3rd dimension, it takes roughly 18-21 years to go fran a baby to saneone who can go out and take care of themselves. On the 4th dimensional world, experientially, it takes about two years to go from your present size and state (when you first arrive) to an adult - and you start grawing again. Your body grows, your head elongates in the back, and you end up looking like Ahknaton. This is what the Egyptian egg of metamorphosis what about. 211"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"All this explains why it is essential that you maintain peace within during the first few hours of the dimensional interface and progression into the next area of dimensional consciousness. Again, work on your character. The xnnent you establish the Merkaba during this time, you've made it. Its the inner technology that is most important. Helping others is very important. As you understand more of what this is about, you have a moral responsibility to help if they ask. Your Cosmic Develounent During this shift, there is a polarity with your 'higher self' which merges into your current state of consciousness to the point where you and it become one. A very high level of dimensional consciousness has as its 'body' the planet Earth. You, on a high level of consciousness, have as your body the body you are currently using. Literally, someday you will becane suns and stars in the sky - it is part of the process of life. Your new 'Parents' Relative to these beings you will encounter, your new 'parents', you already will have a 'karmic' bond with than; they will guide and protect you during the first two years until you can go out on your awn. They realize your true divine nature as part of the creation, unlike Earth parents, many of whom view their children as 'possessions' to be 'controlled'. If your new parents wanted to tell you sanething, you would simply experience it. If they wanted to tell you about a room, you would be in it. It is sort of like an extension of a higher level of dream time fran the 42+2 level of consciousness. The 4th dimensional tealla is really not that much different than the 3rd dimension in sane ways. It's still a world which has a physical aspect to it. Injection of Christ/Unity CMIsciousness Uodels Into The Planetary Grids Uany individual entities have manifested themselves on this planet in order to illustrate the possibilities in unity consciousness. After the introduction of writing, a model was need in order to inject an example into the akashic/ morphic field and into the lnenaory of avln that unity consciousness was an option. Jesus, who had been through a great nunber of dimensional levels, was the entity who accanplished that purpose. Because of his efforts, the IDEA of mawunity consciousness is within the MEUORY of man to act as a model. It is also within the grid around the planet. First, you have Akhenaten as one of the Pharaohs, illustrating unity consciousness - 'that which we would becane'. He walked around for a few years and put that into the grid. He created the seed ftan which the Essene Brotherhood grew. Fran them eventually came Uary and Joseph, who made it possible for the introduction again of unity consciousness through Yeshua Ben Joseph, referred to as Jesus.

It is certain that any apparent omissions or errors within Drunvalo*~ paradigm (in a historical sense) were not intentional on his part, but simply reflect Drunvalos experiential interpretation and pe~ond accumulPtion of data We do not inferentially endorse all aspects of the FOL paradigm in terms of hirtoricPl a~~~nacy, as some of Drunvalos interpretations, based on his own em- ence and data are not verMable In terms of historical accuracy. Tbey are presented along with the material on Sacred Geometry as they provide a certain setting in which the rest of the material unfolds. The Flower of Life paradigm is presented because it is unique, tholrght pvoldng and provides a brrPic understanding of tbe relationship between mathematics, nature and formative processes. It aiso represents a paradigm tbat has its limits defined in terms of light, rotation and dimensional permutations that go no higher that the photon realm - a realm which entities must strive to go beyond. hhy of the major control and manipulation paradigms that have manifested themselves on Earth have the photon realm as their starting point. Consult the reference chat on consciousness levels Readers are assumed to be intelligent and perceptive enough to view the matertal for its intrinsic worth and not in a \"lock, stock and barrel\" manner. It is meant to be related to your own personal experience and your intuitive feelings and is not present in Matrix IV as a \"definitive rendition of truth\". It is simpiy a unique paradigm presented \"as it is\" that speak of things we all give thought to in terms of planetary history, how this came to be the way they apparently are and where we my be going. Experience will take us the rest of the way. Commentary wtthtn the FOL paradlgm about the relationship between DNA structure and height, for one thing, is verifmble in the case of 42+2 and 44+2; the fact that aborigid tribesmen have 42+2 chromosomes has been sctentmcally verffied, as has the normal complement of 44+2; the other dab relating to 46tZ,JS+2 and 50+2 is not immediately verifiable, especially in the metaphysical sense, but may become clearer as time and experience marches on. Much of the information in the main narrative of the FOL paradigm has a certain \"ring\" of farnilarity in the sense that it \"feels\" true and appears to answer mious questions - this will eventually be sorted out within experience in terms of just how accurate it is. Historically, the Egyptian theocracy depicted many statues of Pharaohs as being at least twice the size of normal men - not just that of Akhenaton (Amenhotep 11'). The-evidence suggests that this was done in terms of cultural veneration rather that a depiction of actual size. In fact, Ahkenaton and his Queen are depicted later in terra cotta statuary designed during the latter part of his reign as being norms1 in"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV every appearance to every other Egyptian. There is evidence that this stress on \"natural appearance\" ironically added to his estrangement from the orthodox priesthood. who wished to maintain iconic representations more in line with their own cormolo@cal viewpoint There may exist &al physical evidence that Ahkenaton was of normal physiologicai proportion. During his reign, Ahkenaton was at odds with the Egyptian priesthood, and this faction no doubt sought to \"dishonor\" him after his death. Many scientists believe that the body of Ahkenaton was located as an \"anony- mous\" corpse when Tomb 55 in the Valley of the Kings was uncovered. Burial in this manner would not be out of context considering how the EgypUan priesthood felt abwt him. Indidam within the FOL paradigm that Nefedti retained power after the death of Ahkenaton ls not very well supported by documented lWB that lndlarte that Nefertiti fell out of favor with Ahkenaton wen before his death, historical indica- Uons are that the power structure passed immediately to the Amunian priests at Kamak, who proceeded to wipe out the memory of Ahkenaton in wery way they could; it was the final act in a long series of \"magical wars\" and posturing between two factions. One of the areas mentioned in the FOL paradigm is the apparent relationship between Ahkenaton and large-headed Sirians. While the evidence seems to suggest that Sirius may have a connection with the Dogon tribe and various aspects of Egyp Uan theocraq, it does not suggest that Ahkenaton himself, or his family* had actual physiological features which would support a direct genetic connection, especirrlly in tenas of appearance. to allen Sirian genetics. This is not to say that possible genetic connections do not exist - juSt that there is no direct evidence to support the connec- tion weald in the FOL paradigm. It is a matter of record that Pharonic representa- tians, even in the Old Kingdom, included a culldly objigatory representation of the Pharoah as having an extended cranium. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence ht We-ckuJJed h-aids did es&d - the skeletons rue tbere, hut there is no data that directly indicates that elongated skulls in the Egyptian era were due to alien genetic influence. The propensity for some groups to bind the heads of young babies in order to create an elongated skull is well known, especially in the sense that these groups themselves maintained that the practice was done to emulate the skull pattern of other humanoids considered to be more powem and advanced in earlier times - perhaps some of those species might have been alien, but there is no body of evidence that is meaningfully large enough, in the moment, to support this view with any degree of certainty. Diions within the FOL paradigm of alien influence on plane* orbit or dwelopmental conditions within the planetary field grid are of course unverifiable, atthough the planetary grid connections and their relationship to morphogenetic fields and consciousness are becoming more apparent as the knowledge base expands to include these areas. We simply lack additional information, but that is not to say that infirmation supporting alien influence on subtle levels, relative to \"planetary guidance\" might not appear in the future."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Even though the FOL paradigm, like many others, is an \"unfoldmentw within the context of a light-based control paradigm, it does point out many of the workings within the paradigm that can be of assistance to readers, especially in terms of the generation of contemplation and thought patterns about Sacred Geometry, the worldngs of nature and some of the past history of the planet. It Is well known, of course, that much of the past history of this planet has been deliberately obscured in order to promote ongoing control scenarios by maintaining a certain lack of historical and developmentai continuity in the civilization. Hopefully, the FOL paradigm will induce readers to go out there and win their own research and investigations into them areas. In terms of the POL paradigm half, it might be mentioned that the representation wtthln thls book does not Itself constitute the entlre body or Informa- tion available through that source', it represents a momentary \"slice\" in time of what is happening wlthln that paradigm. There is a lot of good material there, but \"It\" does not represent \"rerlitylt unless you deem it to be so within your nature. Discussions of Sacred Geomew in the FOL paradigm are by no meruts complete, especially in a dimensional sense. Many of the geometrical representations on a two dimensiond basis could be extended further into three dimensional repre- .sentations that would make the discussion clearer, especially in terms of space-time geometry. There are other viewpoints, for example, that state that each tetrahedron creates eight new space-time geometries, each having a 64 point coordinate system, and that the \"Metatrons Cube\" expresses the collapse and expansion of dimensional space by any two opposing face triangles, creating a vorticular motion of spld energy. The outward motion then creates a new frequency \"shell\" corresponsing to the next dimension, according to the progression l,l2,42,92,162 .... 642. At my rate, the material provides a basis from which to begin individual research in this area, and there is mucb more to learn and discover in this area. The FOL material discusses the \"ancient grid\", which relates to the crystalline matrix of the Earth itself amplified by the delibemte placement of some 58,000 structures. but sqvs little about the \"present grid\", which consists of the artiflcial electromagnetic overlay, the interference pattern produced and the effect on plane- tary consciousness. Suffice it to say that consciousness Itself has an effect on how the geometric field progressions proceed. There are also other grid aspects that Bruce Cathie has something to say about These should all be related together. There is a \"danger\" in terms of the FOL material and similar paradigms in that it may appear to give individuals the impetus to \"kick back and let it dl happen\" in deference to individual volition, will and creation. At no time should you kick back and do nothing. Forces on the Ervth have divided themselves into a least two camps of thought (see \"Theoretical Progression of Planetary Paradigms\") but that does not preclude individual planning, thought and action. The presentation in the FOL paradigm as in others, that \"the universe will transform ever$hingM is not entirely the case Individual consciousness is also a function, as is action.

Alchemical works provide a good example, and the reason they seem so difficult to understand is that there is a prerequisite for the individual to have an understanding which is free from pre-conception, as well as a pre- requisite of being free frola culturally programed gridworks which encompass belief systems that nrask realization of the principles discussed. Hermetic philosophy embodies the following principles: Every human being is a transmitter and receiver of impulses which operate within specific wavelengths. These impulses can be detected by a trained conscious mind. Individual sub-conscious levels are inter-connected - the 'collective sub-conscious' * Intuition is the recognition of reception on this level. * The 'feeling of knowing' transmits within this band. Intuition: (In this context) is the absolute knawledge founded on the identity of the mind knowing with the object known. Attend to the definition given above. You can never actually know something unless 'you become one with it'. Intuitive processes operate just below the average level of waking consciousness of the human population, although the barrier generally seems to be' thinning as the mass population evolves, despite manipulation and control. These intuitive processes are functional product of t,he very nature of the Matrix which connects all lifeforms; from one perspective it can be said to be the 'colle,ctive subconscious', but that is a definition reflecting lack of consciousness of the Uatrix - where #st people 'are at'. This Matrix is the Source of all consciousness in all species. The process of access to this Matrix is the subject of all Hermetic and Alchemical works, as well as the ultimate subject for various occult (hidden) paradigrs. Fran a cultural religious body-consciousness disempwered point of vier involving exterior psychological projection, it has been called 'God'. Access to the Matrix requires a certain amount of cognitive restructuring, in that the process of access appears to be 'paradoxical' and 'against the laws of logic'. It requires you to do things that seem counter to anything yw have heard, yet you see examples of these principles in use every day. Norman Vincent Peale (the power of positive thinking) discussed sane aspects of Hermetic principle, but most applications of the principle by the public appeared to be the means .to an end - the end product was the satisfaction of a need based on security, sensation and power for most people. Inragebased ego orientations. The actual process is important, not the things that manifest themselves."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"According to most Hermetic sources, there seem to be three classes of 'knowers': one who 'knows' by virtue of opinion and illusory appearances, one who knows by virtue of recognition of inner truth by power of interior percept- ion and understanding, and one who knows by virtue of identity with the truth because they know themselves - the Holy Grail, as it were, is manifest within them and they have access to knowledge of everything. Hope: a tenn implying uncertainty and a desire in the future which has yet to be fulfilled. Imagination: allowance of anticipation of the future. Hermetic principles only operate in the Eternal Now, the present. The word 'eternal', in this context, does not mean 'a state of time without end', but a state where there is in fact no time to be measured. It is the personal 'I' that observes the present manent 'Now\". The Hermetic Process If you require sanrething in the material world, and it can be reasonably available to you, all you have to do it transmit that requirement to your sub- conscious mind - but the subconscious mind will do it only if the desire is successfully transmitted to it from the conscious mind. The paradox for most people is that to cause the desire to reach the subconscious, the conscious mind must cease to exercise the desire, because as long as the conscious mind wants something, the very act of want ing imp1 ies a future tense in regard to fulfillment. Since the subconscious only deals with the Eternal Present mnt, any idea which is offered within a context that is nat in the present moment will be ignored. Thus, the 'desireg must be thought of as already satisfied. In terms of cultural religious programing, this maxim translates as 'only if you believe it has been granted will it came true'. Any trace of Doubt will render the result moot. So, the paradoxical nature of the Hermetic process (paradoxical from a social consciousness point of view) is that you are required to believe that a desired condition exists before it can be made manifest in the physical world. OYIUBT is an interesting concept; DOUBT is a product of the reasoning process, or the logical side of the brain. The opposite of DOUBT is CERTAINTY, and CERTAINTY is what is behind KNOWING. If you WISH for a desired state, or HOPE that it will cane to pass, you are automatically thinking in the FUTURE tense. As long as you WANT something, and the want (in your mind) remains unfulfilled, aspirations are centered in the FUTURE and cannot be transmitted to the Eternal Now of the subconscious. Thus, \"desire nothing and there is nothing you shall not realize'. The col J-ective subconscious is a force that awaits activation and response through KNOWINGNESS and CERTAINTY. Initiates are advised to work on development of the feeling of KNOWING."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Blind Trust The results that people attain using this method are easily seen in people that have been \"born again\", although these people do not realize what they are truly doing - accessing the subconscious (\"God\") Matrix that flows through all life. By \"putting their faith in Jesus Christ\" or \"giving my life to Jesus Christ\", they are in fact making contact with the creative force of the divine Matrix, although they do not realize that they are in fact as much a part of this Matrix as it is of them, and that the \"power is within\" and it is part of who and what they are as a Spiritual Being. The fundamentalist churchgoer has the belief in a \"God External' and thus never makes contact because \"God\" is an external abstraction. Instead, he places blind trust in ministers of the \"church\", be1 ieving them to be the \"closest representative of God\". Thus the whole structure of the \"church\" is supported by a belief structure to which is has no real claim. The \"caning of Christ\" means the presence of Christos in a regenerated world, not at all the actual coning in a body of \"Christ' Jesus, for Christos is the \"divine\" principle within everyone. The fact that each human being has a personal inlet to \"God\" is a heresy to the Church. Accounts of persecution inflicted by the Church upon Gnostics are graphic and numerous. Ironically, the docments in the Bible were written by Gnostics. \"The Mind is not capable of bringing anything to pass except it be accomplished by the emotional counterpart of the idea\" \"Feeling is the secret.

Evidence suggests that the DNA he1 ix may act as a resonant circuit, with the spiral functioning as the coil, the membranes as a form of capacitance that is connected in parallel as in a tank circuit. In a certain way, according to Popp, the energy scb resembles that of a four-way biolaser; Popp has developed the mathematics of this model to a point where it suggests that this might be the case. The DNA molecule typically consists of two polynucleotide chains arranged in the form of a double helix. Each nucleotide consists of the sugar deoxyribose linked to one of four purine and purimidine bases, with the further addition of a phosphate molecule. The four bases themselves, adenine, thmine, guanine and cytosine (abbreviated A,T,G and C) are linked within the double helix by hydro- gen bonds. Classical geneticists, for sane bizarre reason attributable presumably to sheer ignorance, consider the repeating sugar molecules as the 'junk', while it is the sequencing of the the four bases along with it which provide the infoma- tion content, representing the 'genes' or genetic encoding. The fact that multiple repetitions of the four bases exists is also, according to ignorant geneticists, 'junk' information. Their whole attitude sterns frm a state of rind that is totally empirical, mechanistic, and linear. It is a state of rind which ignores the subatomic, electromagnetic and subtle energy interactions involved. DNA Energy Emissions Fritz-Albert Popp, the Genuan scientist, has worked for many years on ultraweak photon emission of living tissues, He and others have noted that living cells emit light, including infrared, visible light and ultra-violet frequencies, whereas dead cells generally do not, except when in the process of degeneration, Popp maintains that this light is coherent (as in a laser) and'seems to be part of an organizing wholeness within living organisms. The Japanese scientist Humio Inaba of Tohoku University, who heads a biw photonics research program, has also romrented that ultraweak photon mission is clearly associated with a variety of vital activties and biological processes. Based upon sound experimentation, Popp has shown that DNA is a major source of photon emission. He used a particular dye which, when added to living cells, is absorbed into the DNA molecule, first inducing an unravelling of the DNA. Then, as more dye is added, the DNA coils up once again into its complex folded helix, Measuring the photon emission of cells during this unravelling and recoil cycle, Popp noted that photon emission first increased as the DNA unravelled, and subsequently decreased as it folded up again. Further experimentation also indicated that the energy level and distribk tion of eledkons is extremely high in living tissues.

When the gas gains radiant energy, all the atoms in state 1 rise to state 2; half the atoms in state zero rise to state 1 and half to state 2. 2.

Who would have expected it to have a connection with the breeding of rabbits?! Long before myxamatosis solved the rabbit problem which was one of the agricultural headaches of the Australian farmer, mathe- maticians solved the rabbit problem which had bothered the mathematical contemporaries of Fibonacci. The Fibonacci series originated in a mathematical puzzle pro- posed by Fibonacci in Liber Abaci. He proposed that the progeny of a single pair of rabbits arrived as follows. Suppose there is one pair of rabbits in the months of January which breed a second pair in the month of February and that thereafter these produce another pair monthly, that each pair of rabbits produce another pair in the second month following birth and thereafter one pair per month. The problem is to find the number of pairs at the end of the following December. To solve this puzzle we tabulate in four columns: 1. Number of pairs of bretding rabbits at the beginning of given month. 2. Number of pairs of non-breeding rabbits at the beginning of the month. 3. Number of pairs of rabbits bred during the month. 4. Number of pairs of rabbits living at the end of the month.

The cells of wax designed as honey receptacles are of hexagonal cross-section forming a continuous pattern which fills space without interstices. The only other simple way of achieving this is by cells of rectangular cross section, preferably square for the sake of rigidity. Why do the bees choose the hexagonal pattern? If this is a question in psychology, the answer is not forthcoming. But if it is a question in mathematics, the answer is that the shape is deter- mined by consideration of economy and efficiency. The honeycomb is a pattern in space. The genealogical table of a bee is a pattern in time. The Mathematician who participated in. the former had a hand also in the latter.

This pretty result is displayed on the right-hand side of figure 12.3. It is not only the zooiogist through his rabbits and the entomolo- gist through his bees who make contact with the golden numbers. The botanist also meets them in different areas of his studies-in leaf arrangement, in petal structure, in florets of the composite family, and in the arrangement of the axils on the stems of a plant. It is rather rare to find perfect specimens which conform accurately to the mathematical pattern. A field daisy may have 33 or perhaps 56 petals which just miss the Fibonacci numbers 34 and 55, but a daisy with a petal count between (say) 40 and 50 would be un- common. PHYLLOTAXIS Phyllotaxis is the botanical term for a topic which includes the arrangement of leaves on the stems of plants. The arrangements are characteristic of the genera. Leaf \"divergence \" is the technical term used to describe the angular separation of two successive leaf bases on the stem as measured by a helix drawn from the root of the plant upwards to its growing point (Fig. 12.4). The leaf arran&rnent can be specified in terms of this divergence. A helix is drawn to pass through each leaf base until it reaches the first base which is vertically above the starting point.

An ideally simple case is represented in figure 12.5, where the stems and flowers of sneezewort are set out schematically.

The following is a distillation of thought patterns from this paradigm: Materialists have the notion that only three-dimensional space is real, and that a mental events is 'somehaw\" a different ontological order of reality. Reality and cultures are made of language. A 'cultural trance ' exists where the predominent belief systam is that the reality defined by culture IS reality rather than simply a context created by a local language and historical momentun. Cultures invest a lot of energy into maintaining the cultural myth of reality structure. Notable aspects of the 'cultural trance' are male dominance, materialism, absence of 'spirit' within any metaphors sanctioned by the society, constraining and distorting monotheism, that the 'nuclear family' is soate kind of 'traditional social unit', monogamy, and culturally encouraged life- styles that promote the brutalization of life. (The relationship between brain areas used by humans and the resulting psychological manifestations, as well as the social function of 'taboos' and 'forbidden zones' are in Matrix 3.) 5. Many factors point toward the years 2012 and 2013 as a critical apex of acceleration. The factor of 'novelty' is what is being accelerated. In this case, 'novelty' is 'density of connectedness'. What is also being accelerated is the degree to which previously uncoupled systems are being coupled together. The connections are increasing, densifying and ramifying at a tre- mendous rate. This tendency is easily extrapolated (and has been done so by computer) to the end-state, which is where every point in the matrix will be connected to every other point in the matrix. (i-e, a holographic matrix, or 'mnadology' in Liebnizian terms, dissolving the concept of simple location.) 6. As systems are connected together, new properties emerge from the collective system."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"7. The 'Theory of Fractal Temporal Resonances', according to McKenna, points to the fact that 'we are essentially trapped at the moment in 1993, in a resonance with late 8th century A.D.'We9re living in the height of the dark ages, with epidemic diseases, religious fundamentalism and an economic state of retraction. Hopefully, by 1997 or 1998, we will be able to move into the high medieval period, but we will still have to put up with religious funda- mentalism, fascism, and all the rest of it'. 8. Human nervous systems are being prepared for a conquest of dimension, which becomes a conquest of time. 'My theory produces mathematical time-graphs of unfolding of novelty in time, which seeras to indicate that after 2012, data can no longer be portrayed in Cartesian phase space. Of course, developnent of time-traveling technology would also destroy, from the point of its invention forward, the notion of a linear series of events. Technology, until very recently, has served to schemes of hierarchical daninator types of beings. I am convinced that technology is fairly neutral and that it can be placed in the service of dematerializing the culture, which is the most important thing that we have to do. We need political action to confront the dminators and stop the destruction of life.' 9. Time has proven to have a spiral fractal structure the same as the King Wen sequence of the I Ching. Its fractal nature resonates through history. Time is speeding up in a progressive spiral involution, going asymptotic, as it approaches the 'Singularity', a point in the history of the species where we are pitched into a 'whole new galactic board game.' This occurs by kc 21, 2012. - a date that neatly matches the Mayan calendar and other paradigns. 10. According to McKemna, sane things seen as UFOs are distorted reflections of these transcendental 'Singularity' at the end of this time period, mediated through a 'leakage' into the temporal continuum. 11. There are no 'laws of physics'. It's a syntactical structure. To the degree that you can deprogram yourself fran what you've been taught, you discover that 'the raw stuff of reality can be put together in many different ways'. Virtual Reality Systems mingled With Cultural Reality Scenario 12. 'The 'datum' of the world arrives at the surface of the body as one thing. The world does not have eyes or ears - the world 'is'. It a1 1 arrives as a wave fom at the surface and the body responds by correlating the sensory data and 'reconstructs' a 'model of the outside'. What we really want to do is transcend the 'technical imposition' of the senses. Synthesia would do that, and the reason that virtual reality is non-trivial is because it is a technology for showing each other what we mean. We can show our dreams to each other.

Would saae factor of evolutionary change be affected? McKenna: 'We1 1, I think we're getting very close to being able to manage our genetics already. We are taking control of our 'image'. We are going to design ourselves and leave the evolutionary river. Human design concerns will be paramount. That's why I'm willing to entertain the idea that the plant called the mushroom is an extra-terrestrial one. It looks to me like a designed organism that consciously created itself. Indestructible, non- invasive. Able to maintain life in outer space in spore form, able to live off manure. It's a very sensitively designed compact organism. A lot of people are anti-technology. I am not. I think that technology is wonder- full - you just have to watch the monkey that is wielding it. The hunan imagination has grown so powerful that it literally cannot be unleashed on the surface of this.planet. If we start acting out our dreams, cities will be eradicated in an instant. We have to move to a domain where 'its O.K.'. In virtual reality, the difference between a building ten stories high and one 100 tiares taller is just one '0'. What will we build when we can build whatever we want? How will be look when we can look however we want? It's an interesting exercise to ask how the world would be if it could be any way you wanted. In the book 'Mind Children', the author believed that in the future, societies will feel so guilty about people that have died, that they will resurrect everyone as a act of religious piety - a necessary response to the presence of death. Everything that ever lived would be brought back .... if the imagination alone were to set the limits, the limits would be hard to find. We talk about virtual realities as if they were \"other rooras' to this reality, but what about when you bring virtual reality into this one? You could have bi-focal glasses where the bottom half could look into yesterday. What would it be like to live with a pair of glasses like that? The psychedelics drive the human imagination. DUT is a psychedelic that is present in human metabolism. The highest levels of DCCT are between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. in the morning - the same time the highest level of RECl sleep and dreams happen. You can see the types of things that lie ahead in our non-material future. If we insist on continuing to build with matter, we probably have less than thirty years left. If we can make the transition to building with light, there is no reason why we should not join the great mainstream of galactic civilization that must surely be out there. Out in galactic civilization, only 'jerks' build using matter, because it makes the environment toxic. We are on the brink of shedding the physical. Not only the physical body - the physical, period. This raises a lot of anxiety in people - what about sex, water-skiing? Everything makes way for the new. The best of the old will probably be reinterpreted and reinvented in terms of the new reality system that is rising. Power brings the requirement for responsibility.

You have been half arch-angel and half monkey long enough. You are going to have to canrnit to one or the other. Hrraan history is a phase-transition. It only lasts so long, say 25,000 years, which in the geological record is barely a thin line. During a time period like that, hums are as ephenseral as may flies. Ideologies last a while. Uonotheism has been around 5,000 years, as has urbanization. In a way, these institutions use us like microbes inside a larger body to create an organism. However, there is always a transition from a lower order to a higher order, and this transition can be botched. The stakes here on Earth at this time are very high. The energy of the entire planet and the thrust of life for a billion years has been moving toward this period in time. We will either hit the goal or we will careen off into what William Blake called \"eternal death\". There's no backing out. Our destiny is the 'strange attractor' at the end of the tine period which ends at 2012. Our destiny lies outside of time and outside of matter. What are we called toward? In our dreams, when we rise up into hyperspace, then the transcendental object at the end of tima is seen - the 'sacred heart of Jesus', 'the center of the Mandala', 'the caning of Metreiya', 'the waiting space brothers', 'the Grail\", 'the philosophers' stme' - all of these things are simply facets of the 'Unspeakable Attractor' that drew us out of animal nature; It is an unbroken march toward canplexity, and we are now at one of these turning points that comes along every so many million years. We are a collection of dreaming, fearing, emotional huaran beings. There's a thing about the upcaning transition that has not been tnatched by any previousform of transition. This transition is happening in the light of our understanding. Question: You have a theory about the irrpact of psilocybin on language. Would you care to go into that? WcKenna: The DMT/Psilocybin/Ayahuasca group of substances represent a very small family of substances, even within the realm of psychoactive drugs. I really think that these things are unique, and that they are the key to our emergence. The fact that the human body produces OUT to influence the consciousness of the person inside it should inmediately force a look at the state of consciousness involved. We don't understand what language is. We don't understand the relationship of huaran languages and the dance of honeybees and the squeaks of huaped-back whales*.' *Editor Note: The answer to the relationship between language and the dance of the honeybee is tnathematical, as pointed out in the Flower of Life material. It just points out that McKenna has more to learn within the mathematical realms, as have we all. UcKenna: 'Most people think that there isn't much relationship, a few people say that dolphins speak better English than you and I do. I see no evidence.

When you turn to dolphins and whales, they are maarnals, just like us. They are part of the same organism, as we are. Whether they abstract and draw lessons from the past to apply to the future, its debatable. Language seems to be sonrething that settled on us. We wear the mantle of linguistic privilege. Perhaps the octopus conrnunicates a depth of feeling equal to our own, but in a water environment you can never discover fire. You can never have a material tech- nology to speak of. Maybe that's good and maybe that's bad, but it means they're locked forever within the feelin~tone confine of the mollusk body. Question: Would you care to speak about the paradigm that has resulted from all of your experience so far? McKenna: I only ever really had only one original idea, and this is the core content of my personal revelation. It reflects a mathematical relationship, because mathematics is a powerful tool for describing the functioning of the real world. I think I will explain it working frun the conclusion and work back to the beginning. I have talked a lot about the transcendental object at the end of time - this attractor - which is somehow the cause of huaan history; that sanehow has locked on to a higher animal, a primate, and through a period over a million years has shaped and moved this one animal specles deeper and deeper into a relationship with abstraction and cognitive prw cesses - with epigenetic process, not things scripted in the genes, but things written in Hebrew, Greek and Sancrit. The world of language and cultural artifacts. I talked about how NOVELTY is ever more rapidly emerging, and how each level of organization (social, molecular, atolaic biologica1,etc) builds on the previously established levels of novelty. Complexity begat canplexity, and at a faster and faster rate. So, if you . were to draw a curve of this asymptotic approach toward hyper-novelty, you would have an involuted spiral - a spiral that is closing in tighter and tighter gyres around the central point. It's a cliche in &ern journalism about 'how time is speeding up\". Yet, when we look back at hrman history, it is manifestly so. Most people would be content to leave a perception like that at a level of a metaphor. Not me. I wanted to make it mathematically explicit. The end result of all this is a wave, an ordinary wave that looks like a stock market graph, except that it depicts the rise and fall of NOVELTY itself, in the local universe. This is a very radical notion. Mainstream science doesn't recognize the existence of what I am calling 'novelty\". Science makes no colnrnent on the accmulation of complexity in the temporal domain with special emphasis on being close to the present. In other words, the further back in ti- you go, the simpler the universe gets. Science doesn't take notice of that or make the attempt to reason toward a general theory fran looking at that. However, in Eastern philosophy there is room made for a concept somewhat isolnorphic to this, and that is the concept of Tao. Tao is a mysterious force which penneates all reality. It builds up structures (dreams, love affairs, dynastic families and empires) and it"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV tears structures down. It does this according to its own mysterious laws and rules. The stress is placed on the fact that it is very difficult to understand. I took the view that I shouldn't be bothered by being told that smthing is difficult to understand - just go through the declarative statements about it and try and fit them into a model and see what pops out. In the primary document on the Tao, which is the Tao Te Ching, what you read in the first line is 'the way that can be told of is not an un- varying way'. Now, in spite of the fancy handiwork with the double negative, what is being said here is 'the way that can be told of is a varying way.' This to me implied a waveform, the ebb and flow of something plotted on a scale of time. The waveforms describe not only hmn history, but natural history and the life of the planet. If these waves could be understood, there was a high probability that they would be FRACTALS, meaning waves which repeat similar patterns on many scales. If they were, it seemed a reasonable prospect that you could use these waveforms to predict the future. In other worlds, you could reason with mathematical rigor frun areas of novelty detected in the past and predict where these areas of novelty would occur in the future. By NOVELTY I mean sane kind of concept like this: Density of connectedness, annplexity, the opposite of habit. This cosmology could be interpreted as a situation where the universe is a struggle between two energies - one is called HABIT and the other is called NOVELTY. Every time habit gets things locked down and bottled up, sanething happens (ice age, asteroid strike, social revolt, slave rebellion, insanity,etc) which destroys the domain of habit. Chaos rages. That launches a cwnter-flow against novelty back towards habit. History and the life of the planet reflect the ebb and flow of habit and novelty on mny many scales. While on the thousanbyear scale you may be moving through a period of great novelty, ywr life (a micro- scale embedded within) might be dreary and uninteresting. So, there is a possibility of many kinds of canpounded event systems. The way I was led to this was by looking at the I Ching. The I Ching is a Chinese divinatory method of great antiquity that used 64 six-leveled ideograms which are obtained through a process of sorting to produce a hexagram (one of these six-leveled structures) and then a second hexagram which is derived frarn the first. These ideograms are thought to be very deep gestalts into the functional modalities of sane given situation. What I was interested in was a traditional arrangeraent of these 64 hexagrams called the King Wen sequence. The question arose - is the 'King Wen sequencem in fact a sequence, or was it a traditional jumble? What lies behind this question is that if the King Wen was actually a sequence, then it should be able to be generated by a set of rules. If it was a j&le - it was a jumble. I began looking at the King Wen sequence, and I discovered that there was evidence that it was a sequence that was very carefully constructed by geniuses. Perhaps human beings, perhaps not - it's not clear. The people who made the sequence knew as much about how time works as wr civilization knows about how matter works. It was as though these ancient Chinese, or their predecessors went off on an entirely different tack than the Western mind. While the Western mind entered into a Faustian waltz with matter, they put their attention on the phenaaenon of CHANGE. I think that probably practiced some combination of pharnacological and physiological techniques that allowed them to get down within the mind, in great stillness, to the 273"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV quantum mechanical level. In the same way that modern chemists realize that matter is crmposed of elements, the Chinese realized that CHANGE, in all its variety, is composed of 64 elmnts. They symbolized these elements with the hexagrams of the I Ching, and then they arranged them in the King Wen sequence because that reflected a natural process written into the body of the universe, just like the value of Pi. The King Wen sequence represents the data-string of the variables which define the ebb and flow of novelty and habit in the three-dimensional phase-space that humans call ordinary space-time. This concept slowly crystallized. At a certain stage I had produced an eight-foot graph that ran two directions on three levels, with scales that had to be read through. One afternoon, I realized how to implement the whole thing into a mathamtical object which was subject to the ordinary rules of evidence and dis-confirnation. The Graphs In looking at the graphs, they appear to be simple Cartesian graphs; the same kind used for temperature - quantity and time. Unlike a stock market graph, you want to see it going down. The reason I constructed it that way EXAMPLE OF A SYmETRY BREAK EVENT L 0, <-DUnPLE OF m1N-r OF WIW DENSITY OF SYNCHROD(ICITY/CONNEMION EVENT CLUSTER is because my image of time was that it is a 'river' and that eternity is an 'ocean\". The 'river' flows down toward eternity. In the areas of high habit, everything is locked molecular/crysta1line/atomic rules. There's no life, no culture.. .the universe is highly determined. There was a very steep descent into novelty about 4.4 billion years ago. This represents the stabilization of the planet and the emergence of the oceans. Oscillations in the curve occur as the stabilization period goes on, but as time goes on, refinements become more precise. We are now able to plot the novelty mornent by moment. Every theory has a 'hard swallow'. Mainstream science has 'decent' theory where things that don't confonn are 'tucked away'. In the case of mainstream science, the 'hard swallow' is the Big Bang Theory, 'where the universe canes from nothing in a single moment, for no reason, but don't worry folks it was a long time ago...now moving forward.' Scientists tell people to try not and think about it. My theory has a \"hard swallow' that I call 'the Big Surprise. I can place that 'Big Surprise' in the early morning hours of December 21,"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV 2012, where the state vectors of the three-dimensional phase-space will essentially 'disappear up their own rear end'. The entire thing will fall forward into some other domain. Its an incredible proposition. The argument for that incredible supposition is this wave, because the 'zero date' is the point where novelty reaches infinity. There is only one point where that happens - Dec 21, 2012. You cannot evade the intellectual responsibility of choosing that moment. When I first realized this, I had the wave unpinned to any end-date. In 1974, when I went to the end of the wave to find out where the end-date was, I discovered that it was not too long in the future. 'My God', I thought. 'Who will believe this?\" Once you have found the end date, and it predicts all this past history, there is a certain portion of the wave that lies between the end date and the present. That is your 'domain of prophecy'. You are in a position to make predictions. You become a scanner of headlines. Essentially, all I am doing is taking equations similar to those in quantum physics and expanding them to galactic size, and then predicting 'clusters of novelty' in macro-physical space the same way that quantum dynamics predicts the presence of electrons at a certain point in the phase-space matrix in which it is being measured. Relative to 2012, what this means in astronanical ternas is that on December 21, 2012 A.D. at 15 minutes past the Solstice, at dawn, the sun will rise in eclipse of the galactic center. If you use Newtonian mechanics, it -happens once every 26,000 years. If you plug in chaos theory and the nutational laotions of the Earth that are very subtle, it happens just once in all eternity. In laymen terms, its a Winter Soltice, at dawn. As the dawn sun rises above the line of horizon, it is directly in front of the galactic center. It is a helical solstice sunrise in eclipse of the galactic center. I then discovered, having chosen this date, Dec 21, 2012, that its the same date as the end of the Mayan calendar. Now, out of all eternity, the Mayans chose this one date to end their calendar. It's puzzling that I should reason forward to this same date. It implies incredible technical abilities for the Mayan people, it implies that our planet is on a collision course with the 'unspeakable', you know, the 'hyperbolic chronosynclastic inf idibl iariun' that is going to change everything into sanething else, and yet here is the hard evidence. This wave, I would argue, predicts the past frm the extinct- ion of the dinosaurs to the fall of Gorbachev. It only works if you assume that the entire three-dimensional universe is somehow being generated from and drawn toward this intellectual/mathematica1 'black hole' in time, Hwn history is the skewing of an animal species over 500 million years, as we are dragged, sculpted and shaped by this transcendental alien force; it is a force which reveals itself in Christ, Buddha and Mohannred. It's always shifting and its terrifying. It's .... words fail. It's the G-D. It has an interest in this planet and it has an interest in us, and it is drawing us toward a historical climax. So, looking at the graph, when the wave moves down novelty is increasing. The planetary thing,started at a point of novelty in which stable oceans were established and primitive life began. The early crisis (at the habit and symmetry-braking level) was when oxygen was generated as a waste product frcnn life, That was the first toxic environmental crisis. It necessitated the formation of cell membranes to overcome it. It is represented on the graph by a 700 million year 'speed bump'. It was eventually overcome, and multi-"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV cellular life establishes itself which can absorb the oxygen. All these things can be seen on the graphs. From about-700 million years ago, which is roughly when life left the oceans, on this scale it is a straight plunge down into the recent domains of novelty. The wave has set cycles. The universe is assumed to be about 20 billion years old - that's longer than the lowest cycle and less than the next cycle out. In theory, the universe is probably 72 billion years old. It seems intuitively more the case. Examining the period around 65 million years ago, any theory of novelty would have to predict the presence of the K-T boundary that marks the extinction of the dinosaurs. One bright morning in August, an object struck the Earth and eliminated the dinosaurs forever. Looking on the graph, that point is indicated, within the known margin of the timing of that event, at the bottom of a novelty trough. Coming out of that extinction, the planet rang like a bell for several million years. The flowering plants and the shrew-like mamnals began to take hold. Examining the graph, it seems like we have seen this particular pattern before. We have. As I memtioned, the series of graphs reflects fractal mathematics. It keeps exploding out of itself. We have seen the form before, but not these values. The form repeats on many scales, but the values never repeat. It's a view of time which sees the universe as an infinite set of interpenetrating resonances. That fact alone, if known, does produce some interesting observations. Say, for instance, I am eating in Hadrians Hamburger joint. I know that it is causally related to the emperor Hadrians' military campaigns in Britain. It is not a coincidence. It is not a reference. It is a resonance. A1 1 points in time are made up of the interpenetrating resonances of other points in time. A1 1 of history is present in every moment. Analysis indicates that about 6 million years ago, we moved into some new type of domain which was not characterized by the previous steep plunge into novelty from very high levels of habit. It is more like what is called in engineering a damped oscillation around a mean. This period is when the great apes emerged. The oldest known homo-sapiens skeleton is about 100,000 years old. That person could sit next to you on the bus and you would never give it a second thought. The emergence of human beings in the very shadow of the novel ty-attractor. Because the mitochondria1 DNA descends from the mother, you can sequence it and figure out how long it has been since any two people shared a camnon ancestor. When you carry out this operation, you discover that every person on this planet is descended from one woman who lived in Africa about 190,000 years ago. We are all the 'children' of this one wanan. When the earliest Hano Sapiens appear, it begins an oscillation around a mean that doesn't really overcome itself until about 20,000 years ago. From 100,000 years ago to 20,000 years ago, there was oscillation around a mean. It was the dull time of the 'stone age'. This is the time when a symbiotic relationship was establishing itself between psychoactive mushroans and human beings on the plains of Africa. The little ticks on the graph correlate exactly with the nine glacial periods over the last 100,000 years. Some of you might have seen the reports on the news where they drilled through Greenland ice and came up with ice brings that indicated a record of temperature changes over the last 250,000 years. They indicate that it has been 'hell' on this planet, with 15 degree temperature drops planetwide that occurred in as little as"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"five years. There have been 70-year periods when the planetary temperature dropped 40 degrees. This has happened over and over again, and it didn't have anything to do with 'CFCs' or thb 'greenhouse effect'. What we have here is a dynamic catastrophic self-transforning fractal resonance system of interlocking waves reverberating and reinforcing each other on many many levels. Peaks occur at 183,000 years and 91,000 years. Those correlate with various ice ages. At a point 22,888 years ago, the melting of the glaciers went on until about 18,000 years. There was a virtual explosion of material hman culture above a chipped flint level. The dynamics of Africa then decreed the disappearance of ~nushrooras and a drought condition. This stimulates warfare. All across Europe, for the first time, you begin to find in the strata of this era evidence of war. This is where you get the beginnings of male king. ship, slavery, urbanization, special socialized roles. All the ideological detritus with which the 'road to hell' is strewn. There is a dramatic descent into novelty, reaching its climax about 6500 B.C. What was going on in the world of 6500 BC, when the building of the pyramids of Egypt lie 3,000 years in the future? Excavations in Turkey have unearthed cities fm this period that had a population of over 7,000 people. These cities had plumbing, waste disposal systems, apartment houses, special food processing systems, frescoe painting - an amazing civilization that archeologists refer to as a 'burst of pre-mature complexity not to be rivaled until the rise of Old Kingdom Egypt'. The cities were destroyed by a series of fires in 6500 BC. What's going on here? The Indo-Europeans, inventors of the wheel, were on the move. They invented rape, pillage, subjugation, and colonial mentalities. They came out in a series of waves from 7000 BC to about 1500 BC in a pattern of migration that swept them all the way to India. These are the people who wrote the Vedas and drank Sum. They destroyed these other civilizations. After that dark period, there is a break in synunetry, a turning point, which descends into a long period of novelty. Like pearls on a string, the great ancient civilizations of the world appear during the descent. Sumeria, ' Babylon and Egypt. Egypt is right at the bottom of the trough of novelty. Question: Doesn't this theory presuppose your ability to recognize novelty? WcKenna: Yes, it does. One of the main objections to this theory is that history is not a quantifiable phenuaenon. Having said that, its not an absolute unknown quantity. Anybody who doesn't think the Italian Renaissance was not important has a tough argunent to make. Anyone who thinks that the Greek golden age didn't influence the rest of history is barking up the wrong tree. There remains the outline of the ebb and flow of something, and this mathematical approach flushes out the details. Your ability to study history is certainly a key factor. Question: Does the rise and fall of clusters of events seemingly justify the events that occur? WcKenna: I think that the answer is yes. You don't want to get into predestination, because then you have to have an absolute detenninisn. The mathematical"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"indications do not say WHAT will happen. It says 'this is where the novel event is likely to occur, and this is where the probable and predictable events are likely to cluster. It avoids being an absolute determinism by not saying what will happen, In other words, here is where the novel event will occur - it could be a volcanic eruption, epidemic disease, new types of technology - only the window of opportunity for the novelty to emerge is shown. I do have the feeling that it is all scripted in some way, because it all seems to be centered on this point in 2012. Of course, this would mean that there would be no blame for anything, as the I Ching says. Question: Does the waveform ever reach absolute zero as far as novelty is concerned? McKenna: No, it never reaches that point. It is structured in such a way that the time cycles keep getting shorter and shorter. Once the time cycles are shorter than Planck's constant, you fall into the domain of the unspeakable. There is an extraordinarily steep descent into novelty about 950 A.D. This is not thought of as the high point of Western civilization - it isn't. It is the high point of Islam. This is where algebra was born. In terms of technologies, abstract understanding, mathematics, and architecture at the time, there is excellent agreement between data and theory. In the early 1100s, it was during the early crusades - a moment in European civilization where it was sufficiently recovered fm the collapse of the Roman Empire 800 years before to go and make war again on sanebody over a religious hassle. It also brings banking, trade with the east, the rise of the mercantile class, and other things that appeared during this period when the Templars were out and about. Some people say the wave is \"Euro-centric'. The planet is 'Euro-centric'. The technologies, ideologies and social strategies have shoved everybody else to the wall. The wave correctly portrays this fact. To underemphasize Western civilization when you are predicting the outbreak of novelty in the historical continuum would be to go the long way around, I think. Novelty which does not persist is not novelty. One of the indices for novelty is how much influence it has on states which follow. For instance, the Mayan accomplishments were wonderful, but it influenced absolutely no one, because it was in ruins by the time the Europeans got there. A tremendous collapse into novelty occurs which culminates around 1356. What happened in 1356? The plague. Within 18 months, one third of the population of Europe died. No one knows how many people died in the Islamic world. It was the equivalent of an atomic war on the population of the planet. The graph picks it up perfectly. Absolutely. However, a plague like that brings certain opportunities. Land values fall, slaves become free and take land, ruling family lines disappear. There is a permission for new social fonns and possibilities. In 1440, printing was invented in Gennany. Fifteen years later, at the top of the habit curve (a symaetry break), the Ottaman Turks seize the city of Constantinople. European trade routes to the Orient are strangled. You cannot conceive of what this meant to Europe. It was essentially blockaded-"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Europeans began building bigger ships with better navigation instruments and great shipping families were. created. This led to the Italian Renaissance. At the bottom of the curve, in the high novelty area, it was 1492. Columbus sets sail for the new world. - the lost half of the planet was discovered. In 1619, the party was over. What happened in 1619? The Thirty Year War. It was the war that ended Uedieval civilization. At the beginning of the war, popes and kings ran Europe. By the end of the war, people and parlia- lnents ran Europe. Things proceed until 1740. A new vision of the self- governing citizen is born in France. Masons in the new American colonies seized upon this and use it as a reason to separate from England. Which they do. A series of oscillations in the waveform follow, representing the French Revolution, the American Revolution and the counter-flow which was the Napoleonic Restoration. The 'Clodern Era' on the Curve Going forward in time. Lets look at the period from 1908 to 1997. All of history is being repeated as parody on a much canpressed scale. That's why the world is 'so weird'. Since 1945, we have been living at a 1164th scale model of the previous 4,300 years of hunurn history. We see the resonance to the time of the building of the Egyptian pyramids in 1935. The way I inter- pret this is that sunething was going on in 1935 that had something to do with Pharonic Egypt. In Europe at the time there was a taste for over-scaled building projects, sane built by Albert Speer and built by the Gem Fuerher. The word Fuerher can be etimologically traced to Pharaoh. When yw think of the word 'Pharaoh', most people think of Jews having a bad time. When you think of Hitler - same association. Is this mere coincidence? I don't think so. I think we're uncovering the hidden resonance that sculpts the moment. After the war, the battle cry was 'nomalcy'. This is the post-war era. Up at the top of the curve (habit) is the turning point, January 13, 1967. It is resonant with the time of Haner. From 1968 on, the lid was blown off. The psychedelics ended the establishment pattern. In 1978, the first AIDS case was 'discovered'. Sanething novel happened in June 1989 according to the curve. Tiennamen Square happened in China. Two million people bring the largest government on the planet to a screeching geriatric halt, as the people spontaneously present despotism with an incredibly well-organized show of force. Of course the Fascists murdered then all, but that is nothing new. It is what always happens, and that signifies the return to 'habit' at the top of a curve. The whole Chinese standoff is perfectly picked up on the curve. The top of curves I call 'symnetry breaks'. It is where the tide turns.

Val20,s represent a concentration of novelty-moking eventr. Mijor descents into nave apparently occur at 6am on dates whose difference (in days) from the zero date (in 2012) is a number which is the product of a large power of 2 and one or two prime numbers. Numbers that are associated with turning points in the wave tend to be products of a large power of 2 and small powers of one or two primes. Due to resonance, the turning points in the hlgher regions of the wave (hrther in the hear past) reflect the struabre of the wave in its lower regions (ahead in the linear future). McKenna describes the time-wave as a complex fractal compression wave that exists on three levels and flows bidirectionally. The complex computer program that was developed to plot the wave graphically reduces this complex waveform to a single line moving from the 7 billion years in the linear past to 2012 AD, and linear periods as small as 92 minutes can be gmphidly displayed. The highest value of the wave at a point 7 billion years ago is 16,1515,072.04491806, and this value constitutes a date which is 1,649,267,438,232 days before the zero date in 2012 AD. This number has a factor which is a prime number. In the final 400 days tbe timewave tends to have turning points at 6am on each day. The time wave consists of fradally nested hierarchies. When boundary con- stralnts imposed by higher levels in the hierarchy cause a surge toward a zero-state each time a cycle enters its terminal phase on any level within the hierarchy, these surges constitute quantized transitions; examples of these quantized transitions manifested into reality structures are the emergence of life in an inorganic environ- ment, the emergence of externalized consciousness in an unconscious world, the emergence of language in a world without language, etc Other reflective manifest- ations are seen In the clusters of structure-breaking and novelty-making events. In terms of acceleration, ternination of extended linear cycles, or epochs, cause an state of increased acceleration toward the zero state. All hierarchleal lwels proceed toward the zero-time date in December of 2012 AD. Histon. of the Time-Wave Zero Proeram Since McKenna derived the revelations of the existence of the Time Wave in ,1971, work proceeded very slowly in attempts to understand the structure of the wave. It was clearly a hctal compression. By 1974, calculations were done at the University of California at Bekeley by Roy? Kelley, who de&ined that the values of the wave consisted of 64 tables of 381 terms each, or 24,576 terms.

Inter~reting the Time-Wave Gra~hs in Matrix IV Human nature is such that people these days have a bumlng desire to know about the linear future. Sensitive people have the ability to intuitively draw out probable events - it is certain that some of the probable events may occur, but remember that \"prediction\", in these terms, is simply a single perceptive moment in the life of the perceiver that reflects probable patterns in their life at that very mo- ment. Probable reality streams, if you like. In these terms, we are speaking of both the content of events, as well as the linear biming of events. People giving thought to probable events start off addressing these issues in terms of how they niU handle it - this approach often develops into how they are handling it in the here and now, because eventuaily the realization develops that even event Phumts occurs in the here and now Intuitlve perception of approaching event horizons that invoke great change, especially on a sumval basis for a people preoccupied with survival in body con- sciousness, also invoke reactive stress that tends to override the intuitive process that brought about the perception in the first place. First you must deal appropriately with your inner nature, so that you operate more on a creative basis than a r&e one. This means moving out of social consciousness into a more expansive mode of consciousness. How do you address a great event happening right now?

The theory of Timewave Zero was revealed to Terence by an extratemes- trial intelligence following an unusual psychedelic experiment conducted in the Columbian Amazon jungle in 1971. He was instructed in certain transformations of numbers derived from the King Wen Sequence of 1 Ching Hexagrams, leading eventually to a rigorous math- ematical description of the timewave. This correlates time ' and history with the ehb and flow of novelty. which is intrinsic to the structure of time and hence of the temporal uni- verse. At a certain point a singularity is reached which is the end of history - or at least is a transition to a supra-historical order. This point is usually taken to be December 21. 2012. the winter solstice of 2012 and the end of the current era in the Maya calendar. The primary function of the software is to display any portion of the timewave (up to seven billion years) as a graph of the timewave related to the Western calendar (either Gregorian or Julian). You can display the wave for the entire 4.5-billion-year history of the Earth. note the peculiarities of the wave at such poinls as the time of he extinction of the dino- saurs (65 million years ago) and inspect paru of the wave as small as 92 minutes. A remark- able quality of the timewave is that it is a fractal. Once a part of the wave is displayed the software allows you to expand any smaller part (down to 92 minutes). This usually reveals a complexity of structure which persists however much the wave is magnified. a property typical of fractals. The documentation describes the origin. construction and philosophical significance of the timewave. the use of the software. the mathematical definition of the timewave (with proof:. of some related mathematical theorems) and certain curious numerical properties. Ar interesting part of the theory is that historical periods exist \"in resonance\" with eact- other. Resonantly we are (in 1994) at the end of the period known historically as the Dart Ages and will soon be reliving the Mlddle Ages. The software permits graphical display of different regions of the timewave that are in resonance with each other. This allows thc paid 1945 - 2012 to be interpreted as a resonance of the period 2293 BC - 2012 CE. Timewave Zero Advanced Version\" The Advanced Version of Timewave Zero is as described above. plus the following: (i) The Timewave Zero program displays the graph in color. It also allows easy selection of a person- al timewave derived from one's birth date. (ii) There are two additional major programs which are concerned with the full derivation of the fractal timewave beginning from the King Wen Sequence of hexagrams. One of these programs searches the space of all hexagram sequences looking for those with some or all of the properties possessed by the King Wen Sequence. The second program allows you to take any hexagram sequence. including any sequence generated by the first program, and construct a fractal wave in exactly the way described in The Invisible Landscape. (iii) The documentation for the Advanced Version has been revised and includes for the first time a clear explanation of the derivation of the timewave from the King Wen Sequence. The manual also contains a new appciidix setting out an accurate lunar calendar. (iv) The Advanced Version disk includes Dolphin Software's Mayan Calendrics program (sold separately at $49.00). and the Advanced Version mania1 contains the documentation for this program (which includes a detailed explanation of the Maya Calendar). Timewave Zero and Timewave Zero Advanced Version require MS-DOS and run on 1BM PCs and compatibles. The Advanced Version requires an EGA color graphics adaptor or better.

In the Mahabharata, a classical piece of Vedic literature, Maya is noted as being the name of a noted astronomer, magician and architect, as well as the name of a great wandering tribe of navigators. We also find the name Maya in Egypt; the treasurer of King Tutankhamen was nard Maya. In Greek mythology, one of the daughters of Atlas, the seven Pleiades, was named Maia. Even the month of May in the Raman calendar is derived from the name Maia, the wife of Vulcan. Relative to the Maya of Central America, we find that their name is derived from the word Mayab, which was.the tern given to describe the Yucatan Penninsula which was the haae to their civilization. Although anthropological do- has it that the Maya were a large group that crossed the Bering Strait during the last ice age 12,000 years ago, all the historical evidence indicates othenise. The Mayan text of the hpul Vuh, as well as other texts, indicate that the Uaya came from \"the other side of the sea\", which supports the material given in the Flower of Life discourse. Although the Uayan temples were mysteriously abandoned around 830 AD, there -ins the enigm regarding the vast amount of calendrical, mathematical and astronomical data they left behind for others to discover. Even if the Maya had just left behind their architecture and artwork, it would still rank among the highest civilizations that have occupied the planet. The Maya canputed the length of the Earth's revolution around the Sun to within .001 of the figure obtained by todays best instruments. They kept calandars of the .lunation and eclipse cycles and maintained data reflecting the revolutions and sychronizations of the orbits of the planets. Amazingly, on sao3e of their monuments, there are details and dates relating to events that have occurred as much as 400 million years in the past. All of this they accomplished with a unique number system based on twenty that reflected a system of hamnics and an understanding of galactic relationships that far exceeds that of modem day astronomers and physicists. The Mayans were far more intelligent than todays scientists; evidence indicates that their whole scientific base was well in advance of ours. It is clear that they possessed an important paradiga, as well as the scientific knowledge by which that paradign may be applied. For the Uaya, the galaxy was represented by a set of streams of energy, each having radial pulses which were described by one set of primary numbers. Each of the pulsing energy streams have a cmraan end point of origin - the galactic core which the Maya called the Hunab Ku. The circuit was cal led the Zuvuya, and was defined as the current by which everything issues fran and returns to the source. The galactic core, the Hunab Ku, may be described as possessing a sinwltaneous spin and wunte~spin radiating outward fran a central point of tremendous energy that pulses at a particular rate. The counterpoints of energy may be described by a series of nmbers going in opposite directions to each other; one current pulses at frequencies represented by the series 1 to 13; the other current pulses by the series represented by 13 to 1."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Analogies with the Egyptian Paradigm Like the Egyptians, the Mayan paradign embraced a universe of infinite cycles of time and being. There is even a pyramid, the tomb of Pacal Votan, which was built in the style of Egyptian architecture. On the walls of the tomb are depicted the Nine Lords of Night and the Nine Lords of Time. This whole stress on the number nine (the temple also has nine levels) parallels the nine circles of hamnics which reflect levels of consciousness in the FOL paradigm. Above is a depiction of the Mayan symbol for the galactic center, the Hunab Ku. Compare this with the light and dark current spirals and the polar graph information in the Flower of Life paradigm and you will see an instant relation- ship. The Mayans as a Galactic Race According to author Jose Arguel les, the Maya are a galactic race that des- cribe their purpose and science as being embedded in a system of thirteen numbers (there are thirteen spheres in the Fruit of Life) and twenty symbols called the Tzolkin, further described as a hannonic Clatrix. What distinguishes the Mayan frame of reference from the 20th century one is that they operated within a galactic frame. In 1985, Arguelles was contacted by a modern-day member of the Maya, named Hunbatz Men, who stated that our solar system was \"the seventh such system that the Maya have charted\". The Tzolkin, according to Arguelles, was a legacy that was left by the Maya that was destined to aid in the retrieval of galactic information that would assist in alignment of both the planetary civi 1 ization and the planet itself within a greater paradigm of galactic i ntel 1 igence. Furthemre, Arguel les contends that the Maya were here on a mission to assist with this project. It was Pacal Votan, the celebrated galactic master of the Maya, who once declared himself an initiate and possessor of advanced knowledge. The designs on the lid of the sacophagus of Votan have been variously interpreted as appearing to depict a space traveller in some sort of capsule, as is seen on the next"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV page. Votan is described as caning fran Valum Chivim, one of the Mayan star bases, which might have been located in either the Pleiades or Arcturan system. PACAL VCXAN According to research, it is conceivable that these bases had been monitor- ing the Mayan mission since the first wave of 'galactic masters\" (which included the beings known as the Nine Lords of Tim) had \"seeded' planet Earth, Coamunication between the Earth and the world of Votan was accomplished, according to records, by means of what was called the Kuxan Sum, literally \"the road to the sky leading to the umbilical cord of the universe,\" which defined what they termed to be 'galactic life threads\" which connect both individuals and the planet (through the Sun) to the galactic core, the Hunab Ku. The Kuxan SUM is a resonant pathway which provides a continuing channel of carmunication from the solar plexus of embodied beings, through the membrane of the planetary field to the Sun, and ultimately to the Hunab Ku,"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV In another way, the resonant pathway described by the Kuxan Sum can be understood as a series of resonant lenses. The individual human is described as possessing three lenses; the reptilian brain or autonomic system, the neo- cortex, and the assemblage of higher brain structures mentioned in Matrix 111. Mayan Harmonic Mathematical Systems The Mayan numerical system is based on a binary progression that moves expo- nentially forward, using 20 as its base. The entire system of binary hamnic progressions is recorded with only three notations: a dot, indicating units; a bar indicating five units; and a variation of a shell form, indicating zero, place or completion. It is binary because numerically 20 has a base value of two. The numerical values of the first thirteen values in the progression are as follows: It is often thought that the Maya used this system to record periods or cycles of time, but because the system records a universal hamnic binary progression, the notations may also refer to the binary wave hamnic by which phenomena manifest in space. In other words, the periodicity of movements in time as well as the periodicity of manifestations in space are governed by the same universal wave hamnic operating according to the same universal binary progression. The harmonic of space is indistinguishable from the harmonic of time. The progression used for recording terrestrial time cycles was 1:20:360: 7,200:144,000:2,880,000 etc., because the Maya, in adopting the system to the planet Earth, modified the system to correspond more closely to the annual revolution of the planet around the Sun. This progression also corresponds to the series of the hawnics of light, where 144 equals the hannonic of light and the hamnic of each pole, 72 equals 1/2 sine wave, and 288 equals the polar light harmonic and the light harmonic of the planet. The identity of light hawnics with periods of time is of special interest in the consideration of Mayan hannonic progressions; time is the unfolding manifestation of a light harmonic. A terrestrial time sequence of thirteen such harmonics (each hamnic called a baktun) comprises the period for a particular manifestation to run through all of its possible permutations before being"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV raised an octave. This means that in the current planetary scheme we shall be jumping an octave in the next century. In a solar scale based on the progression of the wave form of the prime numbers 1 through 16, the 13th tone is the only one that creates a distinctly audible overtone Matrix, or dimensional break. Thirteen, in this system, constitutes the prime light information wave that represents the means for inter-dimensional shifting. The primary system of mathematics is the universal binary progression that has been mentioned before, 2:4:8:16:32:64, etc.; this progression includes base numbers for the octave (8), crystal synnetry properties (32) and DNA codons (64). Thus, the mathematical system of the Maya is one of the most efficient system for describing the universal wave hanaonics governing the manifestation of all space-time matrices. The system assuaes a unified field expressed through harmonic binary progressions that also describe the unified space-time Matrix as a field of resonance. Harmonic Resonance and the Maya The principle of hannonic resonance seems embodied in the very structure of Mayan civilization. Because hannonic resonance is a basic function of the universe, the Maya could be said to have been galactically informed on a continuing basis. The resonant line of coa~lllunication extends between the human being and the collective planetary mind, and froa there to the Sun and Kunab Ku. A science based on the principle of resonant harmonics could translate the whole nmber rnathematics of DNA codons into wave structures of different frequencies and transmit the infonnation as a resonant transductlon. The Maya could transmit themselves as DNA code fran one star system to another. Through a system like this, infonnation is passed to planetary bodies through the local star (sun) and through the gravitational and electromagnetic field impregnate the genetic information into the mrphogenetic field of the planet. Following the cmpletion of their mission of charting the planet and the solar system, the correlation of the planetary cycles of our solar system within the galactic frame or the hannonic Matrix, the Maya would have returned the way they cam, through the Kuxan Sum. This could conceivably explain the 'mystery\" of the Maya. The Hunurn Light Bady and DNA Since it has been adequately demonstrated in a scientific way in previous sections that DNA has a direct interaction with light, as well as the capability to emit and absorb 1 ight (the work of Popp), it does not take a stretch of the imagination to realize that DNA interacts with subtle energy fields that constitute photonic wave fronts surrounding the physical body. Thus, it is entirely conceivable that the DNA gains infonnation frm all the photonic wave fronts, as well as emitting a photonic wave front of its om. With this in mind,"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the foundation of an emitted photonic light body would correspond to the vibratory infrastructure of the DNA. In addition, if one can align consciousness with this photonic wave front, the harmonic resonance can be used to align the consciousness with galactic frequencies and wavelengths. From another point of view, the DNA infrastructure itself constitutes a light body which interpene- trates the physical body. Just as each living organism possesses a light body- the DNA infrastructure- each species has its collective light body. The planet, too, as a conscious organism of crystalline nature, is also characterized by its evolving light body. According to this paradigm, the planetary 1 ight body is the consciously articulated resonant structure that regulates and allows for the fulfillment of evolution of the planet. The genetic imprinting of the planet is resonantly carried to the morphogenetic fields of the planet through the surrounding radiation belts. The genetic imprinting, according to this paradign, is the function of the lower radiation belt, which is impregnated by the light program of the upper belt. The camnon resonance of the lower genetic and the upper galactic imprinting creates the total planetary memory program, and this total program has been called the Psi Bank. Functioning within the interactive membrane of the radiation belts, the Psi Bank is what engenders the morphogenetic fields, which are memory-saturated resonant subfields whose functioning accounts for the continuity of the various organic life forms. The information flow between a planetary body like Earth and the galactic core in maintained and mediated by a specific mode of solar activity known as binary sunspots. The solar system itself has a subtle sheath (which may constitute its morphic field) known as the heliocosm. Every 11.3 years this heliocosm pulses inward and then pulses outward for another 11.3 years. This cyclical pattern corresponds to activity in binary sunspot movement. During this activity, two prominent 'spots' pulse inward from positions 30 degrees north and south of the solar equator toward the equator, meet, reverse polarity and move back again to their fonner position. A Closer Examination of the Paradigm According to this paradigm, which was proposed by Arguel les, Mayan science recognizes different coexisting dimensions of consciousness. The first two, which relate to the reptilian brain and to emotional intelligence, relate to the use of a third dimensional body. The third relates to what is called the higher mind, in terms of analogical i ntell igence that resonates with the evolutionary purpose of the planet. This thi rd dimension of consciousness Arguel les further relates to the light body, or etheric double (that which the Egyptians called the Ka), and according to the paradign it constitutes the 'fourth dimensional electromagnetic probe\" that utilizes the third dimensional body. The last type of dimensional consciousness within the context of this paradigm is the solar mind, the realm of the evolutionary guides of the planet. This last form is considered to be purely electromagnetic and knows no time."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Mayan Work of Jose Arguelles Sometime over 2,000 years ago a people called the Maya began to leave traces of their civilization in Central America; the true story of the Maya remains, for the most part, a closed book. Though there are depictions of what appear to be captives in the later Mayan civi 1 ization, there are virtually no scenes of warfare. When the Maya began bui lding their astronomical centers f ram 200-400 A.D., the system of mathematics is fully formed. There is little evidence of stages of development; it is a complete system of notations, mathematics, and astronomical calculations with an accompanying highly developed hieroglyphic code. Clearly important to the Haya was the need to track the cycles of the Earth by mans of a unique mathematical system. The purpose of this elaborate record- keeping seem to have been the correlation of terrestrial and other planetary cycles within our solar system with what appears to be a harslonic Matrix of a master program. This Matrix, encompassing the cyclical hamonics of the planets within our solar system, was galactic, as it represented a larger, more encom- passing view than could be obtained from within our solar system. The apparent mission of the Maya was to place the Earth and its solar system in synchronization with a larger galactic comnunity. When the main group of the Maya departed, some remained behind as caretakers, speaking the language of the Zuvuya, a cryptic code language which describes their purpose and their science. The code is ernbedded in the system of 13 numbers and 20 symbols called the Tzolkin, a hannonic mathematical Matrix. Unlike Western science, which bases itself on an investigation of matter, Mayan science bases itself on mind as the foundation of the universe. Universe IS mind, and the different qualities of mind are described in the Mayan mathematics by simple whole-number relations. In Mayan science, what we call matter represents different tones comprising a hannonic frequency spectrum perceptible to the sense of touch. . A further corollary of the Mayan perspective is the universality of consciousness. Since the universe is mental rather than material in nature, in actuality there is only consciousness or intelligent energy. Everything is alive; there is nothing without feeling. In this view, the form of things is the shape of consciousness at a particular resonant frequency juncture, A resonant frequency juncture can be defined as the synchronization of two or more tonal spectrrrns which join manen- tarily in confonnance with universal purpose. The environment may need an ant to aerate the Earth; the ant then is the tonal spectrum joining momentary need wit the universal purpose of aerating the Earth. In a similar way, at one point in its evolution, the Earth may need synchronized intelligence to place it in more conscious relation to the Sun and to the galaxy as a whole, At the same time, the Sun may need a planetary body to consciously ground galactic infornation it is receiving from the galactic core or f ram more evolved star systems, For a moment, let's consider a scenario. Let us assume the galaxy to be an immense organism possessing order and consciousness of a magnitude transcending"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the threshold of human imagination. Like a giant body, it consists of a complex of member star systems, each coordinated by. the galactic core, which is called the Hunab Ku by the Uaya. Cycling energy and information in clockwise and counter- clockwise directions simultaneously, the dense pulsing galactic core emits a continuous series of signals, some of which we refer to as radio emissions. In actuality these emissions correspond to a Matrix of resonance - a vast galactic field of intelligent energy whose primary on-off pulsation provides the basis for four universal wave functions: a transmitting or infor- mat ional function; a radi at i ve or elect romagnet ic function; an attractive or gravitational function; and a receptive or psychoactive function. The sole purpose of the continuous emission of intelligent wave-information from the galactic core is the superior coordination of the member star systems. By superior coordination is meant, first of all, the ability of local intelli- gence to arrive at the threshold of perceiving the whole and aligning itself accordingly. By local intelligence we mean the planetary mind or field of consciousness constituting the self-reflective field of a planet or planets within a given star system. Once alignment with the whole has been perceived and realized by a local system, the purpose is to extend the process to member systems in which the threshold of perceiving the whole has not yet been attained. In this way, the comnunity of galactic intelligence evolves. In this process, some local systems attain alignment with the whole earlier than other systems. In intelligence that reaches this stage is capable of knowing directly by mind, knowing directly the hannonic frequencies of a level or stage of being and having the ability to tune into and even take on the qualities of that level or stage of being. Having achieved this ability, one would also have the ability to apply this knowledge and pass directly from one condition of being to another, a process known as resonant transduction. Using this process, one could pass easily from one star system to another. ' In this manner, the galactic Uatrix begins to be woven into a web of self-reflective intelligence. In order that all systems may attain the same level of hannonic coordination, knowledge or infonnation would have to be systemized into the simplest code possible so that it might be used in comnon. To systemize and transmit this code was apparently the responsibility of the Maya, and it is embodied in the hannonic module known as the Tzolkin. Long ago, according to Mayan records, there were galactic travelers known as the Kuxan Suum, who went about scouting for star systems in which the potential for realization and alignment with the whole was just ripening. According to the Mayan Factor, space travel IS information which is transmitted through the principle of harmonic resonance. We are information. The universe is information. Information is energy structured according to the receiver for which it is intended. The limiting or form-bearing aspect of information does not conceal the fact that the container is in-fonned by a quality of energy. We hear music, sound waves propagated through space, and someplace within we experience an emotional charge. A transduction has occurred - a transfonnation of sound, one kind of infonnation, into emotional energy, another kind of information. 329"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"All energy possesses transductive wave properties. All wave properties are susceptible of being transmitted resonant 1 y as frequency overtones. A coherent cycle of frequencies is an octave, and in all octaves any tone can be sounded to produce overtones in other octaves. Add to this the fact that any wave property can be transduced from one form to another through a particular medium, such as a quartz crystal, and you have the basic principles underlying harmonic resonance. DNA, the genetic code, possesses a wave character structure. This implies that between the cells of the body there is a universal system of carmunication operating at speeds ranging between those of swnd and 1 ight. As we also know, the DNA code corresponds to a whole number formula which represents a binary progression to the 6th power - 2,4,8,16,32,64 - producing 64 six-part codons. A science based on the principle of resonant harmonics could translate the whole-number mathematics of these codons into wave structures of different frequencies and transmit the information as resonant transduction. Like maximum velocity Star Trekkers beaming through the galactic ether, the Maya could transmit themselves as DNA code information from one star system to another. It is always been a mystery why the Mayan civilization disappeared virtually overnight. This could in fact be the reason for the sudden disappearance. Equipped with a disarmingly simple though highly flexible nmber system, the purpose of the Maya in caning to our planet was to make sure that the galactic hannonic pattern, not yet perceivable as yet to our evolutionary position in the galaxy, had been presented and recorded. The Maya may not have been the first of the galactic masters to compunicate information from outside the solar system to our planet. The facts point to various others having at least seeded the planet sometime around 31 13 BC. The Tzolkin bears a strong resemblance to the I Ching, which is also based on binary mathematical permutations. While the I Ching is precisely synchronized with the genetic code, the Tzolkin is synchronized with the galactic code. As the genetic code governs all inforslation concerning the operations of all levels of the life cycle, the galactic code governs information affecting the opera- tions of the light cycle. The light cycle defines resonant frequency ranges of radiant energy that infonn the self-generative functions of all phenanena. The two codes are interpenetrating and complementary. Let is consider the nature of life itself. The genetic code describes only half the picture. Light- radiant energy - provides the other half. Radiant energy is a range of wave-functions that transmits information as well as transmutes energy. Transformation is inherent in radiant energy and , like DNA, is governed by a code. Again, DNA possesses a vibratory structure that parallels the molecular structure. It is this vibratory structure, the light body, that corresponds to the radiant-energy spectrum governed by the hannonic code embodied in the Tzolkin. Within the Tzolkin are 260 components or symbols that inform our senses and mind with the informational keys necessary to relate to and work with the larger world around us. A symbol is a resonant structure, the reverberation of a particular quality of radiant energy that takes forn in our senses. Jung called"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV these resonant structures 'archtypes', form constants that exist in and define a field of consciousness that transcends both time and the individual. Symbols are vital to our functioning as a whole being. - As resonant structures, symbols literally create, work with, and inform our light body. The light body is the electreresonant galactic code bank that informs the genetic code bank in the DNA. The resonant light body underlies and interpenetrates all of our functions. Just as each living organism possesses a light body, both the entire species and the planet, as a conscious organism, is also characterized by its evolving light body. Like the light body of individual and collective organisms, the planetary light body is the consciously articulated resonant structure that regulates and allows for the fulfillment of evolutionary destiny. The planetary light body, embedded in the planetary memory program, can only be activated by conscious, cooperative effort. The key to the conscious articulation of the planetary light body is in the science generically known as geanancy - Earth acupuncture. As the radiant information bank of the planetary program, the 260-unit galactic code can be envisioned as primordially imprinting the electranagnetic structure of the outer planetary sheath, the upper of the two radiation belts that girdle the earth. The information flow between a planetary body like Earth, and the galactic core is maintained and mediated by the solar activity known as the binary sunspots. Both Sun and planet operate with the same galactic information bank. Once a planet attains a point of resonant activation, the galactic information flow mediated through the sunspots imprints the outer electranagnetic sheath with the basics of the planetary memory program. Once the planetary light program has imprinted and begun its functioning, the genetic information will also be imprinted in the planetary field. On Earth, the genetic imprinting is the function of the lower radiation belt, which can then be envisioned as impregnated by the light program of the upper radiation belt. The two radiation belts are like a vibratory loan, weaving resonance rather than cloth. The camon resonance of the lower genetic and the upper galactic imprinting creates the total memory program, called the Psi Bank. Functioning within the interactive membrane of the radiation belts, the Psi Bank engenders what Rupert Sheldrake calls morphogenetic fields - the memory saturated resonant subfields whose functioning accounts for the continuity of the various organic life-forms. What we are describing here is the intelligence structure of the planet considered as a living organism. In doing so, we are embroidering on Jams Lovelock's GAIA hypothesis, the notion that the Earth is indeed a conscious, evolving entity. Virtually all prehistoric peoples were aware of this fact. Given this perspective, let us discuss the Mayan Hannonic in its fonn as the Great Cycle, the cycle of the Galactic Synchronization Beam. Through the collective effort of the larger comnunity of galactic intelligence, the synchronization beam is focussed through the Sun and its planetary system with"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV special attention to the third planetary orbit, that of the earth. Scholars quibble about the exact date that the cycle began. Some say August 6, 11, or 13th in 3113BC. It is almost 5,100 years ago that the planet entered the cycle. It is in 2013 AD that the planet leaves the beam. In order to grasp the meaning of history as the galactically synchronized construction of the planetary light body, it is necessary to understand the role of our planet in relation to the larger organism of which it is a participating member - the solar system. As we understand it, the solar system consists of a central star, the Sun, and its family of at least ten planets. This solar system is a self-contained organism whose subtle sheath or morphic field is called the heliocosar. Every 11.3+ years the heliocosm pulses outward and then for another 11.3+ years it pulses inward. These 11.3 year inhalation - exhalation cycles are referred to as the heliopause, whose total novement occurs over a period of sune 23 years. While sixteen 260-day cycles equal 11.3 years, 11.3 twenty-three year cycles amount to approximately 260 years. The registering of the solar inhalation-exhalation by the helio-pause corresponds precisely to the activity of the binary sunspot movements. In the sunspot activity, two 'spots' - one negative and the other positive - pulse inward from positions 30 degrees north and south toward the solar equator. Approximately every 11.3 years, the two spots meet at the equator, reverse polarity, and begin the process again at 30 degrees north and south of the solar equator. Cued to the heliopause, the total sunspot movement occurs in a period just under 23 years. In other words, the morphic field of the Sun has a breathing pattern some 23 years in duration. If the Sun is the central coordinating intelligence in the solar field, the planets represent harmonic gyroscopes whose purpose it is to maintain the resonant frequency represented by the orbit which the planet holds. Indeed, this is precisely the description of Earth spinning on its axis. Though the heliocosm, the total solar body, is a self-regulatory system, it is at the same time a subsystem within the larger galactic field. Thus, its inhalation consists of cosmic forces - galactic frequencies - plonitored either directly from the galactic core and/or via other intelligent star systems. Its exhalation represents transmuted st reams of energy/i nformat ion returned back to the galactic core. The planets, orbital harmonic bodies, assist in the mediation of the energy information flow to and frola the galactic core. Within the context of morphogenetic fields, the 5200 year cycle can be viewed as a galactically activated field of a purposeful resonance divided into thirteen cyclical subfields. As a total field of resonance, the purpose of the Great Cycle is to facilitate Earths life from the creation and realization of the planetary 1 i ght body. To make all of this information useful, let us return to the 13 cycles as the wave-harmonic of history, as a landscape of morphic resonance divided into seven high periods and six low periods. Each is a discrete field of morphic resonance, and all of them build up as a single wave fonnation to a climax which occurs near the end of the 13th cycle. The purpose of this 'climax of matter' is to induce an increase in hamnic frequency. This heightened hamnic resonance,"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV affected by a singular unification of human consciousness will assist in the propelling of the solar body into the cmunity of galactic intelligence. In this consideration of the 13 cycles which manifest as 13 morphic subfields, our attention is drawn to the ending and beginning of the cycles themselves. The points of transition between the subcycles are critical in our understanding of morphogenetic fields. While the field holds the memory for a species, it is at moments of cyclical transition that changes in the programing are introduced. The more minute the cycle, the subtler the program change; the larger the cycle, the greater the program change. In the human organism, these changes are experienced as shifts in the dominance of particular archetypal patterns. Each cycle possesses a particular morphic resonance, represented by a particular archetype or set of archetypal symbols. In this regard, symbols can be considered as resonant capacitors. That is, a symbol, properly constructed, contains the capacity to evoke a particular resonance no matter where or when. In this way, particular archetypal resonance set in motion during one cycle many carry over into another, or several others. Every 394 years in the morphogenetic subfield, there is a break. During this pause or break, certain symbol ic modes or cognitive dispositions are discarded and a certain new Psi Bank imprinting occurs. The 394 year cycle is, in Mayan tenns, called a Baktun. Within each Baktun there lesser cycles of 19+ years, known to the Maya as Katun cycles. There are twenty Katun cycles within a larger Baktun cycle. The vital form of the planetary lightbody is the structure created by the 52 Katun periods that are embodied in the galactic synchronization process. The period from 1992 to 2012 is the 52nd Katun period in the 13th cycle - the last period in Galactic synchronization. Leaving the galactic synchroniza- tion beam in 2012, the Great Cycle will begin again .During the passage through the Great Cycle, the advanced DNA life forms on this planet have undergone an acceleration and a harmonization that we could refer to as the wave harmonic of history, which is a proportioned fractal of the galactic evolutionary process. The conclusion of the cycle in 2012 bodes nothing less than a major evolutionary upgrading of the light-life - radiogenetic - process which our planet repre- sents. The closing of the cycle is marked by a synchronization of mythic forms and a tone of spiritual regeneration hitherto unknown in the historical phase. Signaled as the Mayan return, the planet wi 11 attain conscious articulation of its light body, thus entering its next evolutionary stage. According to researcher Jose Arguelles, this process of quickening of the planetary light body remains imperceptible until the virtual conclusion of the process. The resonant body of Earth is now in a condition of resonant dissonance due to the many events since 1945 that have affected the resonant structure. The intense subjective effects experienced by the human psyche have their origin in the overall impact of radioactive and electranagnetic pollution on the infrastructure of DNA, causing increased randomness and entropy of behavior. This response of DNA is experienced as socially disruptive behavior, and is only a complement of what is occurring in the larger host organism, the Earth."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV According to Jose Arguelles, the Earth's response to the activity which began in 1945 with the detonation of atomic weapons included UFO activity. Arguelles does not deny the psychic validity of many people who have had CEIII encounters, but defines UFO's generally as Unified Field Organizers, an intelligent release of galactically programed, psychically active, radiant energy simultaneously attracted to and emanated by Earth's resonant etheric body. According to Arguelles, UFO operations are completely a function of resonant harmonics. He attributes the rapid directional shifts exhibited by UFOs as shifts in hannonic overtone alignment. UFOs, says Arguelles, are to be understood as inter-dimensional, Earth-generated, galactically programed electranagnetic cells available to be 'for our own educational purposes'. Mayan science recognizes different coexisting levels of being, different coexisting dimensions of consciousness, which together pass through phases of interactive developaent during discrete evolutionary cycles. These dimensions of consciousness include the repti 1 ian brain or autonomic 1 imbic system, the metabolic/vegatative garment: the emotional-conceptual, strategic horizontal intelligence; the higher mind, the analogical vertical intelligence resonant with the evolutionary purpose of the planet; the Solar Mind, the mind of light, the realm of the evolutionary guides of the planet, whom the Maya call the Solar Lords. The emergence of Homo Sapiens represents, in this view, a particular stage in the evolutionary cycle of a star system, a stage in which the purposive integration of the four levels of consciousness becanes a distinct planetary possibility. The stage called Hano Sapiens, according to Arguelles, has a duration of 26,000 years, which is roughly equivalent to the so-called Platonic Year. The first two levels of consciousness are present in the reptilian brain and horizontal intelligence (rationalism) and are highly inter-active. The Analogi- cal mind, the 3rd dimension of consciousness in the Mayan system, manifests in the 4th dimensional probing and use of the 3rd dimensional human body. The Solar Mind is purely fifth dimensional and has no time constraints. It processes inter-dimensional information on behalf of the planet. The mythic name for the 5th dimensional planetary realm of the Solar Lords, the custodians of the archetypes of the evolutionary cycle, is none other than Shamballa. According to Jose Arguelles, it is in particular attunement with Orion and Arcturus. In this last period of the cycle, as 2012 approaches, the planet will be vibrating as never before. Possibly, this may be an interpretation of the so-called shift into the 4th vibrational plane that may speak of. According to Mayan science, each person is empowered to connect directly, sensuously and electromagnetically, with the energy information emanating from the galactic core. Astrophysicists are currently describing \"density waves\" or beams which sweep through the galaxy and influence evolution. Perhaps sane of Arguelles interpretation of Mayan science holds merit."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV 26,000-TUN CYCLE SHOWING RELATION OF THIRD, FOURTH, & FInH DIMENSIONS, GREAT CYCLE, AND KINGDOM OF SHAMBHALA"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Express ion of the 5,125 Year Mayan Wave-Harmon ic of History on the TimeWave Zero Graph A: King Wen Period in China and the Vedic Civilition in India B: Time of Akhenaton and the Olmec Civilization.

Canbining the thought patterns of Arguelles and McKenna, the period 1618 through 1638 appears to be, in sane way, a result of the previous period of 1499-1618, which was the period of the European Renaissance where both global expansion and scientific materi a1 ism began. During this rather alchemical period, the Christian Church was subject to fragmentation. It was the end of the medieval period, and it was a time where the primitive spiritual hierarchy of the previous period was replaced by a period of secular materialism. Significant events during this time period include the publication of works by Descartes, Kepler, Bacon, and Galileo.

According to Arguelles, the Earth's conscious response to this (presumably manifested through the planetary mind conplex) ws that the resonant field of the planet was accelerated and also became dissonant. The impact of the dissemination of nuclear material and radiation on the planet (interacting with life energy on the surface in a Reichian way and producing DOR energy) also produced slrbjective effects on the human psyche which manifested itself in the form of socially dismptive behavior and the rise in the incidence in cancer, An immediate evaluation of this premise by Arguelles produced the thought pattern that cancer is also a product of environmental pollution in terms brought forth in Hatrix 111; part of that pollution may be nuclear in nature,. but it is by no means the only cause. Arguelles premise is that the DNA itself responded to the environmental radioactivity, as its inf rastructure became polluted, and that the change in the DNA produced the aberrant social behavior; in addition, in Arguelles terms, the change in the resonant frequencies of the Earth produced by the activity of humans affected both the orbit of the planet around' the sun and the overall spin characteristics of the planet, since the planet holds the frequency pattern of both the orbit and the spin, According to Arguelles, if the dissonance goes unchecked, the spin wobble will increase and cause widespread geological havoc. Not to worry, because according to Arguelles, the Earth itself has a self-healing process that results in waveform adjustments which manifest themselves at the core of the planet (crysta1)in order to offset and balance dissonant patterns. The resulting adjustment results in a slightly higher frequency of hanonic resonance being established, although this higher state can be further set off balance by nuclear tests (thank you Bill Clinton) and increases in the CQ levels in the atmosphere. It has also become evident, in terms of technology and sociological transformation, that humans became quickly addicted to sensory feedback that depends solely on artificial technolgical extensions (hello, virtual reality) and environment. The need for artificial inducements to pleasure end up being obstructions to \"the purity of sensory experience\". Fortunately, experience is far richer outside the realm of the physical senses, According to Arguelles, the trap involved in technological development lies in the fact that we create an environment in which all we receive is the limited frequency feack of our own \"artifically devised improvements\", Technology, according to Arguelles, is a direct measure of the acceleration and synchronization of DNtA in relation to the manifestation of the light-body of the planet. The DNA infrastructure is quickened by the increase in technological application and feedback, which affects activation processes within the light-body of the planet. It is a process which remains virtually inperceptble until the virtual conclusion of the acceleation process. One of the indices of the exponential climax of accerlation, according to Arguelles, is the increase in birth rate. Of course, this also sets off a presumed response of the Club of Roce/NWO in an effort to stamp it out by causing death arong the population by any means possible. Arguelles also has coined the phrase \"armegeddon bypass\", meaning a process which happens if the capacity to attain critical synchronization happens prior to environmental destruction, i-e,, we mature before we kill everything."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"Arguelles also speaks of psychosocial issues, and discusses what happens in todays society when individuals immerse themselves in \"Artifical Dependency Loops\" with technology - the result of immersion is neurotic, addictive behavior (Lawnmower Uan?), The immersion of a collective organism (culture) in such loops defines what he calls \"paradigm paralysis*', Herein lies the drama of our times, because the tension that accompanies such a transformation, in Arguelles terms, from acceleration to synchronization is a critical one that is also being experienced in the morphogenetic field, due to inner contradictions that result when a paradigm is bound by belief systems instead of contact with reality \"as it is\","},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"Mayan Ca;endricsm Cib Men \"The program has alrcady been of great help to me in checking the calculations on the texts from my site.

It involved 2,500 Americans who were hypnotized and asked to project themselves forward in time to a future lifetime. The study was interesting in that the respondents did not report a future lifetime between the years 1994 and 2079, leaving a large gap in information for that period. The main interest today seems to be the period frun 1994 to 2012. Nevertheless, the Wambach study is valuable because it provides basic information about what life may be like between the years 2100 AD and 2500 AD. Generally, the results of the study broke down into two time periods - 2100 to 2300 AD and2300 to 2500 AD. Enough studies have been done on past-life regression, The Wambach study was based on the premise that respondents could be asked to project themselves-into the future and that some sort of viable information could be gained. Past 1 ife regressions have produced verifiable results, insofaras people have revealed past life experiences and descriptions of places they have never been to in their current lifetime, and have verified sane of these perceptions on visiting these places after the regression has taken place. The future life projections were conducted over a period of several years and several groups were involved; there were also future life projection experiments done by Dr Leo Sprinkle, and these results are also mentioned in a recent book by Dr. Chet Snow called \"Mass Dreams of the Future\". Dr. Snow discusses all the future life projection studies of Helen Wambach, who is now somewhere out there planning a future life of her own, as well as the studies of Leo Sprinkle and other investigators. Helen Wambach offered the workshop participants a choice of five time periods (three periods in the past and two in the future), with instructions that their subconscious minds would choose one of those periods in which to explore another lifetime. Out of the 2,500 people in the study, 6 percent reported being alive in 2100 AD, while 13 percent saw themselves in the 2300 period. Only a handful of subjects progressed to the future. Similar statistics applied to every workshop held in the United States between 1980 and 1985 with this agenda. Over 60 workshops were held by Wambach. Leo Sprinkle held more than a dozen. As a result of these studies, they were faced with evidence of the decline of up to 95 percent of the planets population within a couple of generations. Alanned, Wambach asked one of her subjects to progress to a specific date in the late 1990's and had to bring her back suddenly when the subject found herself choking to death in a big black cloud. Proceeding carefully fran then on, she discovered a few facts about the period between 1990 and 2000. There was evidence of severe earthquakes in 1998, a new kind of US currency issued in the 1990's as a result of a government reform, increases in food prices, severe weather patterns, financial crises and bank failures, an increase in volcanic activity, and a combination of these factors which result in the decimation of large numbers of people.

Sane of the respondents in this group reported living in high mountains or near the ocean, although planned urban environments and monastic desert lifestyles were also reported. The state of the atmosphere was described as fresh and breathable, warn and sunny, with breezes. Buildings were typically constructed of glass, nmrble, 1 imestone and concrete. Greenhouses were often incorporated into other structures. The average 1 ife span seemed to be fairly long - 92.4 years as compared to 75.5 years for the dismal existence described by those living in space environments. Transportation was provided, in one instance, by sum1 1 hovercraft. Geodesic done houses were quite predominant- Population seemed to be sparse; there was an overall impression that there were large unpopulated areas on the surface of the planet, which was further reinforced by the fact that the respondents in this category were in the minority. It was also inferred that the idyllic environments might have been isolated pockets in an othenise toxic environment that were maintained that way by use of crystalline technology. Clothing generally described by respondents in this category consisted of loose-fitting garments, such as robes and tunics, accanpanied by simple footwear. llost of the clothing was predaainantly white, gold or blue. Others wore tight-fitting clothes, including jumpsuits. Still others reported they were wearing slacks and a shirt. Roughly one third of the respondents replied that fruits and vegetables made up the bulk of their diet, with fish as a periodic supplement. Host indicated that supplies were kept at a conrmunal storehouse, although 21% of the respondents indicated the existence of markets and modern-style shopping malls. A signature credit system of payment existed, as well as the use of coinage and bills and small pyramid-shaped objects. Only 25% of this group reported seeing spacecraft in the sky. The general trend of their experiences in this area were positive in nature. The purpose of the space craft was generally felt to be one of delivery of supplies. Several described visits by highly evolved extraterrestrial beings who interacted with them in a teaching capacity. It was generally seen as a spiritual experience, although sweral of the respondents replied in a manner consistent with 20th century religious belief systems; \"seeing Jesus at the end of a light beam\" and 'you are the light' were two cements."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV 2100 - 2200 AD High-Tech Societies The type of environment reported by the bulk of the respondents in the study was one which seemed cold and mechanical, with physical survival as the prime motivator in existence. Modern highly technical cities existed both on the surface and under the ground. The surface cities existed within large daned structures that isolated the population f ran a toxic envi ronment outside- Because of the living conditions, the average life span appeared to be 44 years of age, which is significantly below todays average life span of 65 years. Many of the subjects reported dying of disease or accidental causes. The typical respondent in this category reported the outside environment to be toxic, barren and desert-like. Sane subjects again reported life as an androgynous sexless being, and sane even hinted that they were part machine. Clothing was reported generally as tight-fitting jumpsuits and boots. Food was reported as being chief 1 y synthetic, general 1 y obtainable f ran storehouses that were kept stocked by spacecraft. Payment for supplies was generally made using si gnature systems, h'andpri nt systems, or objects of exchange which consisted of tokens made of plastic, aluminum, or crystal; one respondent mentioned 'blue-colored dollar bills'. In contrast to the previous social scenarios, there were encounters with space craft that were described as hostile; ships were mentioned in such a way that they represented a possible source of personal danger. Approximately 63% of the respondents in this category replied that the location of their residence was in the continental United States. A large percentage of these reported their location as Arizona, Other locations mentioned were New York City, New England, Utah, Washington State and Oregon, as well as Australia, England, France, Canada, Tibet, and the shores of the Indian Ocean. 2100 - 2200 AD Post Apocalyptic Societies The last grouping of responses fell into the category of survival in a post apocalyptic era which was characterized by the presence of urban ruin. The people generally maintained their existence in either an urban \"Had Uax' type environment or environments which varied from temperate, green and moist to arid and barren deserts. Host of the buildings and transportation methods were in resonance with those in use in the 18th century, including log cabins, wood frame houses and clay or brick homes. Transportation ranged from walking to driving a horse and wagon (52%); machines such jeeps, trucks, scooters and cars were also mentioned. Petroleum products existed but were in short supply. Clothing varied, with pants, shirts and skirts in predaninance. Other clothing styles described consisted of robes, furs and animal skins, heavy outer wear (in cold snowy mountainous terrain) and flannel clothing. Food consisted of meat (beef, chicken and rabbit) and vegetables (which included squash and beans). There were no exotic or synthetic foods described within this group."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Sane people procured supplies from sane sort of a market or general store. Payment seemed limited to gold, silver aod- copper coinage, although there were other variations in payment such as \"black stones\". No mention was made of signature or credit systems or extraterrestrials. Locations were people lived ranged from North America to Africa and Asia. Several of the respondents mentioned South Dakota, Montana, California, Arizona, Canada, Mongolia, the Russian Steppes, India, Tibet, and Israel. Some urban survivors listed their living area as Moscow, Cairo, Uanhattan and Los Angeles. All urban enviromnts were described as stark and desolate, and seetned to reflect the lifestyle of street people as we known them today. The general feeling with the respondents in this category was that sane sort of cataclysm had occurred within recent memory; a post wartime scenario is a possibility. Only one individual in the entire study attributed his death to nuclear attack: the preduninant problems appear to be pollution of the enviromnt by negligent industrial corporations and pcnrer-hungry governments. Life in the Period 2300 - 2500 AD Life in the 24th and 25th century appears to be a bit brighter, according to the results of the study. In the two or three centuries that follow the 2100 AD living situation, hunanity at last seems to have broken the bounds of the solar system and has also engineered improvements in the envi romnt on Earth. Almost half of the respondents in the study, relative to this tinm period, report lifetimes spent exploring other worlds. Those on Earth speak of a regenerated planet- Interestingly, only 12% of the respondents actually found themselves in physical bodies and operating in linear ti=. A significantly larger percentage of the respondents found themselves \"alive' during this period of time than in the period of 2100-2200 AD; out of 2,500 respondents in the study, only 98 prwided data relative to the earlier period of time. Relative to the period 2300 - 2500 AD, 270 reported physical life-times during this period, and ten reported being alive in an 'energy body' without gender or most of the characteristics associated with existence in a physical body. Out of 270 subjects reporting lifetimes in 2300 AD and beyond, 135 reported that they had the male gender, 118 reported that they were female, and 17 reported that they appeared to be androgynous. In the original group of respondents, 217 were female and 53 were male, indicating a significant percentage of the group were in a different gender than they were now, although the balance was still roughly 50/50. The average life span for the respondents in the 2300 - 2500 AD period seemed to rise from the rather dismal average of 66.2 years in the 2100 - 2200 AD period to an average of 73.1 years for the 2300 AD period, although eliminating 28 cases of death in space would bring the average to 76.7 years. Oddly, the average life span of those in space during this period was 54.3 years. There was one report of an extreme age of 400 years in a person who reported to be a monk 'whose body wore out'. Not counted in these cases were 12 people living on planets not in this solar system that reported that they didn't die at all, but either transmuted their bodily energy into another fonn or gave lifespans of laore than 2,000 years or longer."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The chief cause of reported death for 30% of the respondents was disease, ranging frun radiation sickness to heart failure. In 28% of the cases, the subject reported leaving the body behind consciously and voluntarily, and most of the voluntary departures took place after the age of 80. As with reports fm the 2100 AD period, many of the subjects indicated an increasing flexibility and serenity when it came to leaving the body, compared with their 20th century counterparts who were hung up with body consciousness or identified with the physical body. Most of the respondents who 1 ived in space indicated that space life severely shorted physical existence. Most of the environmental living categories described in the 2100 -2200 AD scenarios were still present in the 2300 - 2500 AD time period, but significant changes had developed within these categories by the 24th and 25th centuries. Respondents lived in space, solar space colonies, planets not in Earths solar system and on Earth in collective cmunities, high tech colonies, evolved high tech colonies, rustic carmunities and survival-based groups. The presence of significant off-world colonies suggests that hunan clvilitations began to spread rapidly outward into space after 2100AD, although many reports suggest that physical contact between Eartktype humans and other humanoid species outside the solar system began to be more camonplace. Although contact with other species was reported to be cumonplace, none of the participants in the study in the 2300 - 2500 AD period specifically identified the extraterrestrial species. One respondent indicated that she was very uncanfortable in the presence of a thin alien being, and a man indicated that he did not like sane of the non-human visitors encountered in the comunal dining ha1 1. A1 1 of the revelations about non-human contacts were offered spontaneously by the respondents, and not in response to direct questions about It. In one workshop in 1984, there were indications that space was militarized during the time period 2300 -2500 AD, and that conflict with aggressive alien species sanetimes occurred. More than half of the respondents reporting lifetimes in the 2300 - 2500 AD period also reported that nourisbnt was derived from vitamin cunplexes and synthetic foods, energy producing pellets and liquids. The other half of the respondents reported the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and various meats in addition to processed foods. In general, consumption of meat in 2300 AD was well below 20th century standards.Commrna1 dining was reported to be camnonplace. The process of obtaining supplies involved the use of spacecraft, automated dispensing machines, and even the use of a dematerialization chamber where an individual was transported to the supply depot. Other supply sources cited telekinesis and hydro- ponic gardens. Method of payment for food and other supplies seemed to vary fran standard signature and handprint systems to use of tokens, coinage and bills. Sane respondents indicated that they did not have to pay for anything. Planetary methods of payment were similar, but included barter in rustic living situations. Plastic cards with raised dots and spikes were also mentioned, with different colored cards for various purposes. Architectural styles for planetary living in 2300 - 2500 AD varied, depending whether the living site was in or out of the solar system. Non-system building materials ranged fran transparent glass-like materials to steel, aluminum, silver, adobe and stone. Most structures appeared to be danelike and enclosed, and were often connected together with other danes by shuttle systems."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Structures built within Earths solar system were chiefly dd cities. The vast majority of respondents seented to indicate that their living conditions were acceptable and that planetary living seemed to take place in a pleasant environment. One respondent living on Earth during the 2300 AD tie period reported living in a pueblo-style group of buildings set amid rolling farmlands and well-tended crops. Clothing in the 2300 - 2500 AD era consisted chiefly of tight-fitting one-piece unifonns or jumpsuits, loosely draped long robes or garms, short tunics or dresses and traditional shirts, pants, skirts and blouses. Clothing in rustic situations was mostly synthetic and woven fabric. No animals were apparently ki 1 led for their products. Cotton and wool were produced and bartered with nearby settlements.

More than half of the respondents in the Warabach study, when asked abut the 2300 to 2500 AD period, revealed that they had cane back to Earth to live.

Other Research Results of Helen Wambach Now that we have examined the reports and data pertaining to the period of 2100 to 2500 AD, let us return to the present moment in linear time. As we saw in the introduction to this section, there are indications that political tensions around the planet remain high in the late 1990's and into the first decade of the next century as nations scramble to maintain living standards in the face of sociological, political, financial and planetary upheaval. According to the investigations that Dr. Helen Wambach did undertake regarding this period of time, the Middle East continues to be a trouble spot. There was one subject that indicated another Arab-Israeli war and fighting in Jeruselem. Political problems in Europe continue to mount, with social disruption and strikes. In 1999 there is an isolated incident of a nuclear explosion in Europe which kills many people. The combination of natural and manmade disasters wi 11 apparently cause widespread distruction in the late 1990's."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Despite all the seeming gloom and doom, it is evident fran the work of Dr. Wambach that life will not be totally annihilated on Earth. Instead, the plane1 is entering a period of profound evdutionary change. In this age-of blantant materialism, based on Cartesian/Newtonian mechanistic reductionism, concepts like future lifetimes and consciousness apart f ran a physical body can be very frightening, especially for people who are rigidly programed by religious and cultural values meant to keep people operating in the lower brain structures. Like other researchers, Wambach also felt that this planet and the solar system are spiraling through time and space in a cyclical pattern of 26,000 years. At two opposite points in this cycle (as mentioned in the first part of this book) we enter a sector of material reality bathed in specific kinds of radiation patterns which increase Earth's rate of detectable electranagnetlc energy - a process that is cumulative and requires time to become noticable. The effect of this increasing energy state is to heat up the core of. the Earth, which is itself a living entity, causing geological upheaval. When the character of the energy shifts further, it will modify the energy fields of all living organisms, including humans and non-hmns in residence, causing an increase in psychic capabilities. Organisms that fail to adapt to the higher rate of energy will simply cease to exist in their current physical form. As mentioned in the first part of this book, the precession of the equinoxes was quite evident in a series of catastrophes that occurred between 12,500 and 13,000 years ago during a period marked by Earths last ice age. Sane scholars claim to have found evidence of prehistoric disasters 26,000 years ago, around the time when Cro-Magnon man suddenly replaced Neaderthal man. The Work of Dr. Viola Neal Contemporary psychic sources also cite our solar systems current entry into new energy fields as among the reasons for a shifting of the poles in the next few decades. Back in 1963, Dr. Viola Neal discwered she was able to maintain a dual awareness while asleep, allawing her to cane back to the waking state with infonnation. In a November 1963 session, she care back with infonnation that pointed to a period when the Earth would be subject to radiations that would raise the frequency of the planet and affect consciousness, as well as the vehicles of expression (bodies). This meant that entities of a lower hamic rate would than be unable to incarnate on the planet. Today, we have enough infonnation about what is happening to say that Dr.Nea1 was probably correct. 1 The Work of Peter Lemesurier ( British author Peter Lemesurier concluded that the Great Pyraid in Egypt was based on highly sophisticated mathematical knowledge indicating an influence of another civilization technically more adept than the Egyptians. He felt that scientifically accurate measurements of the structure revealed the fact that its builders intended it as a blueprint of the future destiny of the planet. Based 'on this assunption, he wrote 'The Great Pyramid Decoded', in which he discusses I the chronology of this plan outlined in the geometry of the pyramid and its 'relationship to historical events from 2623 CB through 3889 AD, which he saw as"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the end of humanity's physical journey and graduation to higher spiritual dimensions. What appears to be extraordinary about Lemesurier's analysis of the Great Pyramid, literally inch by inch, is his contention that it pinpoints the century between 1914 and 2014 AD as being the \"cusp\" between Pisces and Aquarius that is the critical juncture of human history. According to Lemesurier, this is the time when soulds must choose whether to participate in the eventual spiritual evolution of humanity or resist the process. Resistance creates the propensity for destruction, as far as Lemesurier was concerned. He felt that the Great Pyramid forcasts a brutal collapse of material civilization within three years of 2004 AD (between 2001 and 2007). The lowest cycle, according to his calculations, is predicted to occur in 2010 AD, \"followed by the return of the Christ in 2034 AD'. Lemesurier felt that the current scenario foreseen by the Great Pyramid represents a mirroring of the events preceding the Great Flood, which took place around 10,500 BC, \"when the previous material civilization of Atlantis was destroyed\". Lemesurier felt that the Great Pyramid was built much earlier than 2600 BC, shortly after the Deluge, by Atlantean refugees. Citing various authorities to back this conclusion, he noted that recent research by Swedish scientists has revealed that the last known reversal of the Earth's magnetic poles occurred around 12,500 years ago, and that it coincided with the rapid melting of the glaciers formed by the ice age. Interestingly, this time period is exactly one half of a revolution around the precession of the equinox. Further, because the Mediterranean Sea of 10,500 BC lapped the edge of the Giza plateau (which could be the reason that salt deposits were found inside the pyramid), Lemesurier felt that \"the blocks composing the pyramid could have easily been transported by water from stone quarries'. Obviously, it did not dawn on Lemesurier that advanced technology could be used to build the structure, and his theory is viewed to be as viable as the theory of the earthen ramp. Nevertheless, his mathematical analysis and the resulting linear dating processes have evoked some interest."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Work of Iben Browning In August 1990, in Leading Edge No. 15, the work of Iben Browning was first revealed to the general readership in the reprint of an April 1990 article from 'the San Francisco Chronicle titled 'What If He's Right?', which discussed the fact that Browning, a mathematician, had been accurately predicting geological activity based on mathematical projections, which were in turn based on astm- mica1 calculations about the pressures the sun and won exert on the surface of the Earth. At that time, Browning was 72 and in ill health. He has since passed on. At the time, people referred to Browning as having one of the greatest minds of the 20th century. Browning was correct, within a few days, of predicting the eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980. He also accurately predicted the San Fernando earth- quake of February 9, 1971. The forecasts Bming made, according to statements made by him, are spin-offs from a general theory he developed when he took up climatology as a hobby in 1957, when he was working for Sandia National Labs in New Uexico. At that tine, he began insnersing himself in several scientific disciplines .in a manner not often done in an age of narrow specialization. The data he consulted ranged fran magnetic field intensities during ancient Egyptian dynasties to records of lynx pelts bought by trappers by the Hudson Bay Caapany in the 17th century. He became convinced that earthquakes and volcanic eruptions were triggered by sunspot activity and the pull of the sun and anon on the brittle crust of the Earth. Measuring warming and cooling periods throughout history and correlating them to historical developnents ranging from the rise of conquerors and great religious leaders to mass migrations and the mean latitude of wars, Browning concluded that human fate was a function of climate. He dismissed the current worry over whether hunan pollution is causing a greenhouse effect as being a case of pitiful conceit, and maintained that human influence on the weather was trivial, Of course, with the advent of weather engineering using Reichian orgone technology and scalar weather engineering, discussed by Bearden, Jerome Eden and others, it could be a different story now, Nevertheless, Browning stated in 1981 that a cooling of the Earth began in 1940 as the climate turned back toward the predominantly glacial condltions that have prevailed over the past 2 million years, and that this cooling would mean poor harvests and would shortly do0111 Cawnunism and lead to freedom in Eastern Europe. Obviously, some of that has since happened, but Browning further main- tained that the emerging free market economy would be helpless to deal with the subsequent crop failures, In 1990, when the article was published before Browning's death, it was pointed out that the United States was already feeling the effects of unusual weather patterns (which have persisted well into 1993). Browning predicted that severe winters, late springs and dust bowl conditions would plunge the United States into deep depression by the mid 1990's. He also mentioned the Kondratieff Wave Theory, developed by a Russian economist, that maintained that Western capitalist nations were prone to up-and-down cycles lasting 50 to 60 years, Its author held that the 1929 market crash was forecast by the 1870 crash, A London businessman compared the Kondratieff Wave Theory to Bmnings own YSHTF (Vector Sun of High Tidal Forces) theory, and Browning concluded that there was only one"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV chance in 68,000 that it was accidental. According to Browning in 1990, 67 years have passed since the last great earthquake in Tokyo, which is rocked by quakes about every 70 years. The last time, in 1923, the Japanese GNP dropped by 65 percent. The effect on the United States' economy of a massive withdrawal of Japanese capital after such a cataclysm can be imagined. Asked if he was a pessimist, Browning replied, \"No, I'm not. Han will survive. He always has.\" According to Browning, if the perception between tidal forces and climate is correct, the average temperature of the Earth can be expected to keep declining, perhaps another 1.0 to 1.5 degrees projected for fifty years, followed by an increase in temperature back up to where we are now in another 110 years. The climate will continue to be variable, with new highs, new lows, new precipita- tion records, droughts, big storms, and high tides.

Steln Los *nge*s mes 7- q3 Evidence frozen in a core of ice from Greenland suggests that glo- bal warming, previously thought to be. a slow, steady phenomenon, could trigger wild climate nuctua- tions in the next 100 years Global weather patterns have been remarkably con&ta~t sioce the last ice age 10,000 years ago. so scientists came to believe that a stable climate was the norm for interglacial periods.

Dust and gas trapped in the ice suggest that the last inkrglacial period more likely was a chaotic jumble of climatic swings appar- ently capfed by radial changes in atmospheric gases and Atlantic Ocean circulation patterns. The 40 scientists on the Green- land Ice Core Project said they were troubled by the news because that last interglacial period - the Eemian .period about 120,000 years ago - is often considered much like what today's world would be if it .were slightly warmer. .: The scientists made the report in tbday's issue of the journal Nature. \"If tbe global-warming theory proves true and air pollution cam es Earth to gain several degrees in average temperature, they specu- lated the planet could experience a similar period of wild climatic swings between today's tempeate weather and near-ice age condi- tions. Each period could last from a few decades to a few millenia. Confirmation of that hypothesis could come from a second ice core being drilled near the first, the team of huopean and American scientists said..

The Earth has had many \"equilib riarn\" climates that were different from today's temperate climate. he said, such as the hotter. wetter Cretaceous Period, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. ' \"We can affect our climate so that it shifts from one equilibrium to another.\" he said, \"and the shift, the transition period, will be filled with violent extremes until it sets into a new equilibrium.\" ;.Earth's climate system is so eompla that human activity alone is .onlikely to trigger a short-term catastrophic change, he said. but it could be .enough to speed up or emggerate natural cycles in ways that are hard to predict. New evidence of warm-weather climatic oscillations adds to such concerns, scientists said. \"Reviously we just assumed the last warni period was very similar to. the pnscnt period and just sta- ble lie it is now,\" Eric Wolff of the British Antarctic Suroep told Reuters. \"Finding that it wasn't raises fears about what could hap pen if it gets warmer.\" : Wolff and hi colleagues in the Greenland Ice Core Project re- trieved the ice sample on which thev based their conclusions bv - -pp - driiling nearly 10,000 feet into & ib sheet covering the island.

According to the Institute, the new book is 'too controversial' because of \"Monroes activity helping dying people', but I suspect something else is going on; helping dying people, in terms of his first two books, would not be very controversial. We have done several pieces in the Leading Edge revealing other kinds of activity going on at the Monroe Institute, according to several graduates, but that is not what will be discussed here. Despite the allegations, Monroe himself has made a signifi- cant contribution to understanding some of the elements involved in out-of-body travel; his most interesting work is his last book, \"Far Journeys', and the aspect relative to the paradigm explored in Matrix IV is that of explorations into Earths linear future, sanewhere after 3000 AD (where they stopped count- ing). Let's take a look at what is out there and then what we see after 3000 AD. Monroe initially discovered that the Earth is surrounded by several rings or bands that were deep gray or brown in color, and that these bands were occupied by entities, many of them discarnate or exteriorized entities who still occupied or had recently left their human physical body on Earth after the body had ceased to operate (died). The First BBnd The first band was occupied by entities who appeared to have a preoccu- pation with distortions of the original survival imprint and were still bonded conceptually to time-space materiality. Because of this, the band was filled with what Monroe (and other entities he worked with described as 'a mass of discordant, undirected thought radiation\". The first band consisted of four areas. The first area (the innennost one) is occupied by exteriorized entities (where the physical human body has died) who attempt to participate in physical life with no success, and they are completely unaware of anything but physical existence. The second area is occupied by exteriorized entities who are attached to a physical body in current Earth time and space who may be in an out-of-the- body state, but are attempting to continue a physical waking activity. Because of this, from a more expanded perspective, they may disappear fm view right in the middle of an activity as they wake up in their physical body. The third area is occupied by exteriorized entities who have permanently left their physical body but do not realize it, and are trying to continue a habitual physical existence, often remaining around familiar occupied bodies ('people') while acting out &notionally-based drives and fears. Monroe viewed this area in the First Band as one of the major blockages to the flaw of humart learning experience, and stated that the number of entities in this area will keep increasing as long as human values that generate that condition remain unchanged on Earth. The fourth area in the First band is occupied by exteriorized beings who are still attached to the reality of physical matter, although they do realize that they have left it (died). These entities have adopted an \"anything goes' attitude and mental framework in which they express themselves through replicas of physical reality in unusual and bizarre ways. Monroe illustrated one example of a bizarre manner of expression when he told of a seething, squiming pile of hunan forms trying to sexually stimulate each other to no avail, since they really did not have a physical body. 375"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Second Band The Second Band consists of exteriorized beings who realize they are no longer in a physical human form in physical human life, but have no awareness or concept that any other possibility exists. Monroe observed that they appear to remain motionless and passive, but expectant. The Third Band The Third Band consists of exteriorized beings who know they have passed through physical death, and they retain a BELIEF SYSTEM relative to what they expect after physical death. Because of this, innumerable areas are created within this band that are belief-system oriented resonant levels. If a number of people have a similar belief system, then they end up creating a facsimile reality where they a1 1 congregate. This band is by far the largest band, and it' is the place where Kyle Griffith was referring to when he wrote his book 'War in Heaven'. It is apparently a very manipulative place with all the same game playing and power brokering that goes on in physical human 1 ife. This band is also the reason for the comnentary that 'there are many mansions in heaven'; all the 'believers\" in all religious 'after death scenarios' end up staying here before recycling back again through a different body (as they do in all the bands). Conversely, those who 'believe' there is nothing after physical death end up in their own resonant level within this band. There are billions of entities lying there in stasis, side by side, in rows. Unless you realize that consciousness and energy creates the nature of real ity, welcome to a long stay in Band Three. The Fourth Band The Fourth Band consists of exteriorized beings who are more advanced than a1 1 those in the bands below, and who have arrived from outside the band areas to prepare for their final human experience 'below' on Earth. When an entity on Earth who is advanced has their physical body die, they quickly pass through all the bands and disappear from perception in a wink to those in this band. Why Cane to Earth in the First Place? Earth is not the only place in the universe where there is a time-space reality system, nor does it lie on the only vibratory level where there are time-space realities, but 1 ife here (because of the nature of 1 ife on Earth and the extreme dualities and polarities involved) represents one of those places that represents a unique challenge to any entity who has problems to work out that require such a location. According to Monroe, any time-space scenario (of which Earth is a whopper!) has unique aspects which contribute in interesting ways to the development of both intelligence and consciousness itself. You won't find an entity like the 6th level Jehovah entities who are even willing to go through such an experience. Because of that, many entities who reside on other vibratory levels have not developed knowledge of what love, compassion and empathy really are - that's why they feel the need to be obeyed, worshiped, and identify with CONTROL and MANIPULATION. Going to a level where the NORMAL non-physical rules of existence are suspended is beyond their willingness to give up their identity with control. 376"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"EXAMPLE OF THOSE DESTINED FOR A THIRD BAND EXISTENCE AND A REALITY SIMILAR TO THAT IN \"WAR IN HEAVEN\", UNTIL THEY REALIZE THE NATURE OF BELIEF SYSTEMS, THEIR OWN IDENTITY, AND THE FACT THAT CONSCIOUSNESS AND ENERGY CREATE THE NATURE OF REALITY. - Estimate of Alabama's doomed is raising he1 Baptists claim soul purpose was to help 9-18-'73 BIRMINGHAM.

You may recognize the psychological symptans of control paradigms in the Keys of Enoch (appealing to the human intellectual side), the Raelian movement (appealing to the human sensual side), and even in the Bashar material (what is good for humans is too good for Greys). Its part of the negative polarity hierarchy, which is fine - it is their choice, and they will eventually get it; one of the keys is that if sane entity demands to be \"followed\" or seems like they are putting themselves \"above\" you - good clue. If there is anyone or anything out there claiming to be someone you should 'follow\" (so much for Uaitreya) - be advised - or pay the \"price\" in your own delayed development and theirs. You are your path (you as your \"essence\") - that has been taught many times, but too few listen or understand. Humans have a culturally conditioned and genetic quirk which \"demands\" that they take the \"whole stick with the carrot'. Once the nature of reality is known - that all falls away. Wake up and get a life, or for that matter, several of them. It has been observed that 99% of people who are unhappy are that way because they spend 99% of the time doing things for 'themselves\" (their ego/image as identity). There isn't one there. It's an illusion, What a learning! The cosmic humor is incredible, I suppose, but cunpassion, empathy and understanding are definitely in order. Reasons for Existence in a Human Body on Earth, Or For That Hatter, Anywhere, and the Process Involved I suppose this is the BIG .question for many 'people', but the answer is a COMPOSITE one that is pretty straight forward. SOME of the reasons are (1) Simple curiosity. Those who have never been involved with a demanding existence operating a physical embodiment find it a challenge. (2) it is a chance to experiment within a particular'point within the history of the planet. (3) the limitations imposed assist a concentration of specific aspects of energy only available within an embodiment. (4) it means an intense learning process which forces a mixture of polarities, providing a potential understanding of what is involved (5) it is an opportunity to realize an embodiment other than what you have been used to, for an added dimension of experience.(6) Imprisonment. In order to completely understand, in sune terms, what a general nuisance it is to come into a body, compared to being without one (as your essence), you need to understand that when you are without one, you can go anywhere you 1 i ke in the universe simply through the devices of thought and emotion. To cane into a situation like this you have to agree that linear time \"exists\" (as time is spherical in nature on other levels) in order to 'have' primary 'human\" consciousness. You have to accept that consciousness expressed through \"human\" physiology and genetics is severely limited. You also have to accept that fact that in order to do this, you have to sublimate (suppress) the memory of both the thought process that you went through before you did this, as well as the memory of other experience from other life patterns (both physical and non-physical) so it does not interfere with the life pattern in this physical embodiment. The memory remains at the essence level within you, but is not normal 1 y retrievable under ordinary ci rcurnstances. This memory at the essence level may constitute a significant part of the driving energy in this life experience, depending on what you came here to accomplish."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Next, it requires that you select a -propitious birth entry point with appropriate genetic, envi ronmental , social', political and econanic patterns that you calculate wi 11 ensure realization of purpose for entry (you are able to see it all from that standpoint), despite the existence of variables that may subvert the original purpose; it may involve taking certain actions to realign the probable/possible outcane. Since there are many who seek embodiment experiences (and many who seek to avoid it at all cost), very often a birth entry point is taken away, despite less than ideal circumstances. What a deal; it's like bungee jumping without a cord. Barn! Out of the tube and into the light. Ho longer in your NATURAL state, you suddenly discover that the physical body has severe restraints. A while is spent playing with your toes and other strange appendages trying to obtain control over them before they obtain apparent control over you (that happens later when 'body-consciwsness' is reinforced to the max in society). In your natural state energy simply flowed into you; now you suddenly have this over- whelming desire to conslome nourishment for the body, all amidst a cacophony of sensory overload, genetical 1 y programed drives (and later, raging hormones), genetically (and later culturally) programned response patterns which becane habit, and genetic memories fm everyone who ever had anything to do with the DNA patterns the body is canposed of, pain and pleasure, sexual stimulation and body-driven emotional complexes. What a bungee jump! Where IS that cracker, anyway? Since you are seemingly stuck in a body, you are subject to various brain learning mechanisms. Primary learning is what you get when you are focussed on sanething. What you are not focussed on while you are focussing on something is the mute for secondary learning, and a third form of input occurs while your body is sleeping and you end up in a brief, nowfunctional void. Initially, and probably through a good part of your life, your attention is motivated by virtue of the pleasure/pain cycle. Then, you go to 'school'. School is a process of non-educational programing stressing law-order repetitive experiences and the physical senses which results in an unnatural situation centered around the knowledge, manipulation and control of physical matter and loworder energy systems geared toward reinforcing survival imprints and social ego-orientation, as well as BELIEF patterns not based on actual experience, which results in a secondary psychological drive in society to look for 'what is true'; the process also eliminates any mining threads of contact with essence fnemory and knowledge of your actual origin and identity. Then, you interact in 'society'. Society is where the individual is conditioned to identify with the body and then the ego/image (in that order) and accumulate emotional attachments relating only to expression in a time-space reality to the degree where a canpulsive need develops to re-enter the time-space continuum (trapped on the lower rings again?) solely for the purpose of satisfying the need (to 'pay off debts', to 'finish the house, etc). 'Human' existence can become addictive. Your original genetic survival drive becanes distorted through cultural programing and results in distorted patterns which focus on body protection (where is that gun?) body maintenance (what is that new perfume?), sexuality and reproduction and the need to 'protect' 'what one owns' in order to 'support the body'. As if that is not enough, sex as a creative act is distorted to the point where it"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV results in irrational and restrictive \"attdchments' and 'cmitments' based on cultural ideals that are actually unattainable. But ... they didn't tell you that. The focus on all of this is further enforced (especially if your body has a different color that most of them) by the cultural importation of opiate drugs, alcohol, and other substances to keep your awareness dimned to the lower three structural areas of the brain, as well as to financially sustain cultural economic infrastructures based on ego, image, security, sensation and power - all of which have absolutely nothing to do with WHO the entity ACTUALLY is or WHY they are here.. . . .resulting in the search for 'the meaning for life\"; the creative energy within the essence that manifests in emotion is further distorted culturally to the point where the SOURCE is forgotten (is there a GOD?), suppressed, or rejected, resulting in a chaotic mixture of misdirected energy which transforms the 'human' into a reaction-based judgmental canplex rather than a creative one, and promotes psychological projections and facsimiles as being a true representation of \"reality'. Are you sure you want to cane to Earth? Not Get t ing Hog-T ied and Ring Bound Upon Ex it Now can you see why the rings exist? How can you escape being tied to them when you leave your body? You must realize that you are not your body, that enotional attachments relate ONLY to time-space reality, keep the love and release the sexuality, divest yourself of sexual ties, lighten the load by refusing to bond lasting emotion onto any physical act or the actions of other beings, and make an effort to conduct yourself in the Eternal Now. Physical objects exist within space and time to be USED not owned. We actually 'own' nothing or no one - even the body we use is borrowed material. Store the memory, experience and wisdan and leave the emotion connected with the experience behind. You are responsible for the results of your actions within a space-time continuum. Enjoy the cosmic humr in life. Identify emotional energy bound within pleasure/pain related memory patterns and seek to remove it. Maximize your sleep periods and the tertiary learning in order to give yourself a break fran left-brain thought patterns and 'physical\" input. Free Will as an active operational concept in human space-time existence is actually pretty limited due to all the influence; what there is can be easily coerced - until you realize and becane connected to the essence WHO YW REALLY ARE that is not subject to space-time events. The idea of maturity equates to the amount of illusion you have released and discarded deliberately ...y ielding wisdan. If you don't 'own\" the experience, you' 11 repeat it, or variations thereof, unti 1 you do. Now, lets get to what Monroe saw in the period 3000 AD plus. 3000 AD: The State of Affairs At That 'Time\" When Monroe was taken to a period after 3000 AD relative to Earth, he was surprised to see that the deep grey and brown rings were no longer there. Instead there was a single flat ring which radiated light of its own accord. The ring was full of conmunication but no discordant noise. There were no cities or evidence of any mechanized civilization at all. The air was clean, clear, and the ecological balance of the planet was restored- He"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV questioned the entity accompanying him about the envirorment, and it was said that the ecological balance on the planet was restoted by design, not by virtue of a disaster of sane kind followed by random growth. There were no people at all, but this was also by design. The Middle East was still a desert region, but there were no oil wells or any trace of civilization, roads, buildings, or anything that could be consider- ed artificial construction. Monroe then experienced a fully operational physical body within this envirorment, he could breathe, but he was on an OBE fran his original 'container' back through the dimensional levels. He eventually came across other entities on the planet, but they were non-physical and used non- verbal cannunication. They told him they did 'use\" physical bodies on occasion, and that they kept the bodies (which they manifested f ran thought patterns using anything, even dirt, as raw material) in 'energy cocoons' to keep th in good condition. The entities told him that one time on Earth, entities where told 'you are note than your body\", but now they were told 'you are more than you energy self\". Now, entities (even while in a physical body) could transmute matter. They told him that they could experience canpressed learning nodes, which they defined as being able to experience 'earth consciousness' fran the view- point of every species - they could, in essence, integrate their consciousness at will with any life form, experience that life form, and disengage their consciousness again. There had obviously been a heavy withdrawal frola the survival imprints and bady consciousness of the civilization of 'old Earth\"; they could even experience being 'eaten alive' - the genetic memory of horror for huaans in a body for millions of years - and pop out again with ease. There was no need for sleep. They could draw energy from ambient space, whether they were using a badyor not. Ncm - this is the kicker - They told Monroe that entities newly arriving on Earth at that time period first had to experience one hunan life cycle at a period before all the changes were made and then they were allowed to spend time there. Monroe was told that these one-tim experiences were going on in the 20th century for sar# of those destined b mturn to occupy the dimensional area around Earth in 3000 Am. Those who graduated fran the Earth environment did not return. They no longer needed to experience Earth and they could take on physical forms in lessening degrees of density and radiation patterns until they no longer felt the need to do so....on their journey into the infinite growth patterns of consciousness that were developing all the time.

HOW ALIENS RELATE TO THE DIMENSIONAL CHANGE ( Like Stepping In d Out of Sleep ) COL.LOWUC QUrnlOWl How do the aliens fit into this quantum leap in consciousness? COSMIC AWARLIILSS: This Awareness indicatesthat this is something different, and that it has much to do with the effects the aliens are having on the ecology of the planet.

COSMIC AWARKl)CU: This is in the affirmative. There will be simkities. This Awareness reminds you of the Aborigines of Aust- ralia speaking of the Dream Tie, which was a time before all of these things occurred, the present reality. The Dream Time in their reference is that which is the next parallel realm in which entities may transfer. It is simply a change in vibration in cosnciousness. The phy- sical realities will appear much the same, even the maps and locations on earth wiU appear much the same. This Awareness indicates that if you were, for example, at present, to step into the astral world and begin travel- ling around, you could find yourself astraI travelling to the Pacific Ocean, to the various places along the Pacific Ocean or some other location, and you could see these phces in your astral travels, eren if you have not yet been there, so that when you later travel by body, and physicai vehicle, you could recognize that you had been there before, in your astral travelling. This Awareness indicates that you simply shift into a different dimensional frequency and go to the same areas and visit those areas in a different frequency. Any- one in their physical form at the place when you are visiting in your astrai body would not witness your presence unless they had special sight, but you would still have been there in a different frequency, thus, two bodies can inhabit the same place in different frequencies withopt intaiering with each other.

This Awareness indicates that inhigher realms, this is not so sudden, so extreme:Bodies will tend to fade, more likened unto those changes that occur in fictional movies, such asstar Trek, wherein a body begins to fade out, or can come back if so willed. This Awarerres indicates that entities have more control over life and death in those other realms, it is not so highly polarized as on the earth . plane where you either are alive or you are dead.

Tbis Awareness wishes to restate that thk time given of 2012 or 2013 is not an absolute end of'the world as you know it. It is the timetable of the aliens in their plan and their efforts to move changes on this earth plane. It is their timetable. It follows the Fatima proph- ecies and the Fatima prophecies are basically those time zones of the alien plans for the future. This Awareness does not wish to indicate to you that this is the absolute future. It is what the aliens ham planned and may occur unless there is sufficient change and enagy to alter the future of the aIien plans.

Can you comment?\" Th? 4wm~nes indicates that it does appear that there is that which may be considered as a parallel universe coming closer into conjunction with this known universe or realm. This Awarenes indicates that when these two realms meet on the same vibratory field or rak, many entities wiil cling to the other redm, and when these realms pass through each other, some entities will remain with the known physical realm and others will go into the passing realm. It is likened unto vibrations that merge momentarily and screen those who are of a certain compatibility with the one vibration, while allowing others of the' other vibration to be separated and go in that direction. This Awareness indicates that the frequencies or vibrations of these two realms, are not seen as being identical. but as being harmonic and compatible like.ocbves of. the same note, but on different frequency levels, so that-they play together in harmony and then move back into sep- arated individualities. This Awareness indicates when this occurs there will be cntities who move into the higher octave realm and others who remain with the more gross and lower octave energies. This appears to be that which will take place around 2012, wherein many will experience a major change in the world. It is likened unto the end of the world in a sense. It is crsentialiy the end of a vibration and the beginning of a new frequency or realm. This may last for quite a long duration before these energies again come back together. This Awarenes ind- icates that it is not clear to this Awareness whether the message just given was understandable or if it was too complex. This Awareness suggests if it does not appear clear, this Awareoess can elaborate further. This Awnreness indicates that It has previously suggested that the year 2012 appears to be a time when the world as you know it will end. Thii Awareness indicates that if you can visualize the world as you know it in tenns of vibrations and frequencies as though you were looking at this world throueh a microscove. seeing all of the material parts of it as vibrating atoms with spaces between, you understand the world as you know it is full of holes, is full of space, much like a film or image that when viewed up close appears almost gaseous in nature, but when zoom back and looked at from a distance, appears to be a solid mass. This Awareness indicates that your sense of sight and touch and so. forth, your senses are used to perceivine the world as a solid mass of matter, when in actuality it is composed of unlimited numbers of vibratory particles: atoms and .v batomic parts vibrating all in tandem, with spaces'in between these subatomic particles, and that the world as you.know it is not an absolute solid creation because of all these spaces between the atoms. Now, if you can visualize this world as you know it as n kind of band of energy that moves through space and comes in contact with another band of energy that is vibrating at a higher rate, and these bands of energy flow together and through each other without disturbing tbe molecular presence of each other, and then pns on through, even as light particles or waves can shine through each others' beams; if you can visualize this kind of merging of vibrations of two different octave levels in the form of frequency vibrations or energies passing through each other in time and space, whereby entities and their vibrations on this band of light energies have the option of switching identification from one set of frequencies to the other that is passing through, and in so doing, they find themselves moving into another reah of exist- ence, another realm of creation. This Awareness indicates that other entities cling to the same vibratory octave and do not shift position, ident- ifying with the same frequencies as before, the same lower octaves, and you can perhaps visualize that some entities will go into the higher reaim or higher frequency realm, while others remain on the lower frequency realm, and this change that occurs becomes symbolic of the end of one age and the beginning of another in a kind of shift in the consciousness of frequencies or vibrations of beings along with the same shift in the frequencies of planets that are different realms and frequencies or vibrations. This Awarenes indicates that the earth itself then event- ually merges back into itr same realm and frequency levels while energies and entities from earth are shifted into higher frequencies of the incoming realm that encroaches in a vibratory sense, into the harmonic frequency of the earth, but on a higher octave vibration, and entities then are moved into a new realm of experience, a new realm of existence, a new earth, a new heaven. ThiS Awarenes indicates that this appears to be likened unto a kid of rapture in which some entities wiil move into different states or realms of experience while others may remain on the earth and its same vibratory experience. FOLLOW-ur outrrtort(vt~~~): If I'm correct, another way of saying this might be that since life is always in motion and vibrations are either going up or down all the time, at this time of 2012, the bridge to the next upper and lower levels will be in place to collect the souls to their appropriate vibrational levels of consciousness.

If thcy arc feeling that, then thcy ;at probabiy accurate, because the perception of time is based on the \"heartbeatn of the planet, as well as the fiequcncy of every cellin our body as is attcmpts toresonate with that pulse. In terms of our actual qerience, every time we experience something it is associated with an elecfrical chmge and afeeling - in this way the expexiena is stored within the electrical mutrix within our body. That is why we are beings of emotion. Haw we store that infinmalion detenrrines, to a significant degree, how that infhmation is balanced. When we have an experience that we determine is painful we have a tendency to want to forget that experience as quickly as possible. The experience will not be stored in a balanced manner. For example, if we have experienced a very paidid experience of lave, there is a tendency to take the energy of that experience and put it away quickly in some aspect of the human matrix. The physical counterpart of that ma& is gcncraity associated with the heart. What happens during the process of the cells in the body trying to resonate to the increasing vibrational rate around US is that q experiences that are stored within thme cells that are not hannonic and balanced have a tendency to mumyest so they can be restored in a bkd manner. We are experiencing the close of a cycle that started 200,000 yem ago. At the close of this cycle, we will experience a unique event. To su- process through that unique event, we must be as balanced as as healed as we can be.

It is the electrical potential within the cell, m tcnns of the potential between fluids and mem- branes, that allow expression in these realms. Ultimately, all these is regulated or modified by our thacght prmesses. This is where the connection becomes apparent with how the body expresses itself electrically and how human thought processes are involved. Of cour~e, the primary internal processes of the genetic entity (the body) are also irrvolved, as primary processes of thought also occur on those levels. When we generate a thought, it is accompanied by a emotion - a feeling. The generation of thoughts and fetw has an effect on the chemical balance on a cellular level, which in turn has an effect on the frequencies emitted by the body on a cellular level. So, m essence, we think and feel m terms of frequency generation.

Specific geometrical patterns art ah associated with those fiquency infinmalion grids. and these also relate to specific sound patterns. For every form, there is a fi.equency that is associated with it. For every sound, there is a fonn associated with it. In Sanscrit, the original sound of creation, 3b or Om, is based on a very specific form. Basic forms mvohfed m the don process are those described in studies of Sacred Geometry. if wc vicw the worid around us its a hierarchical interlocking scrics of grids, with each grid supporting specrdic fiquency bands (which have tqurvalent tones) and specific geometries, and our chakra system as the inttrface which allows us to access those grids, what you see is the human form as a composite that is capable of irccessin& simultaneous&, several statca of being We art used to the concept that we access onty one state at a time, but scientists are finding out what Initiates have always known, that m high meditative states individuals are accessing all of these states, simultaneously accessing delta waves, theta waves, and more, processing all of it into a continuous state of awareness.

As we become more conscious, we move both our general and cellular rcsonanu out fiom under the infh~tnce of \"st&c\" grids. We're no longer subject to \"gridlock\". More on the Great Pyramjd and Consciousness Grids As mentioned in the Flower of Life treatise, the area near the Giza plateau is the primary anchor point for all the grids within conscious awareness that most humans on the Earth are m resonance with. The consciousness grids primariiy focus on \"cubic\" infoma- tim systems; humans tend to have thought patterns which lead to straight lines and sharp angles - not spherical shapes and curves, although there are many examples of the m- fluence of non-linear grid systems around The resonance of our bodies to those grids dctermincs how we perceive our nality and how \"belief systems\" an perpetuated. The largest pyramid on the Giza plateau was there before the Egyptians even arrived, and prtdatcs the Ice Age (as does the Sphinx). There arc no wri#tn records of anything being built on the Giza plateau. It is built of a nahmlly occurring granite with a high quartz content thw was xnincd about 400 miics south of Cairo. Tht primary chambers arc composed of this granite; the lower chambers are carved out of bedrock and predate the rest of the structure by ed thousand yeare. In the mid-1970's a scientists at the Univm- ity of Chicago obtained a piece of the outer casing stone and analyzed it under an electron acatming microscope. It was determined that the outer casing stonca ( of which there are only a few left) were cut with a laser device. The middle layer of the Great Pyramid is composed of a material that is primarity caicium carbonate. The outer layer is composed of a micrOcryStaUine hestone. Geologists investigated the source of this hestone between 1986 and 1988 during the process of trying to @we out how the Great Pyramid was built; they took core sample of the limestone, thinking that if it was naturally occuning limestone they would find stratification m the core samples, as we1 as tiny marine fossils. They found no strata, no fossil material and that the limestone was homogeneous all the way through with no variafion It was not naturally occ~c~ng limestone; it is an artrjiciol stone that was poured in place. Ancient texts describe this material as being called \"Evcrfast\", and dc- scn'be it as bemg designed to last through the end of the 200,000 years cycle. This artrfjcial calcium carbonate limestone is chemically the same as human bone. This means that the atomic bonding structures are eql~d, and there is a resonance with human bone. Human bone structure is Wed harmonically with the grids on the Giza plateau. In Matrix 3II it was illustrated how the hyperspacial-tetrahedrd structure of human bone in the skull was conducive to the m&kztion of thought impulres. We also spoke about morphogenetic fieid structures in Matrix IE The grids that reftrence to the Giza plateau are morphogenetic m nature, d because of the resonance between the materials of the Great Pyramid and human bone, as well as the morphogenetic field matrix and their attendant grids, it is possible to change the entire human species at this point on the planet by introducing a change into the gnd. An example of a change that has been effected through this grid matrix is the change in human Me8pan. Ancient texts are littered with descriptions of humans that lived as long as 800 years. Recently, a chamber was discavered in the Great q?.amid that is fined with radioactive sand.

The idea that human beings are \"angels that have fallen from some state of Grace (We have not fallen from any state of Grace but have chosen to descend into dense matter for the purpose of experience in this frequency and its dualism. There is no separation between humans as embodied composite beings and their angelic counterparts, other than the perception that it is so). 2. The idea that humans were \"born into sin\".

This is a process that the genetic parents of humans have not cxptri- enced. The Concepts of \"God\" and \"Creator\" Usually in human society, the terms \"God\" and \"Creator\" are taken to mean the same thing. They are not. There are many \"Creators\" in the Universe. We ourselves as a race have been \"procreators\" and have now come to the point where we too are broaching the point of becoming \"Creatm\". The human species now has the ability to creak life- forms. Beings that create lifeforms are \"Creators\". All beings, however, generaliy acknowi- edge the existence of the \"God force\" - the \"God force\" not being an individual or a race of beings but as the Universat Intelligent Matrix that weaves itself through every aspcct of creation. This Urtiversal Intelligent Matrix does not have judgmtnf nor does it \"care\" what we are doing or how we are living our tives. It is an overall intelligence - a force - which interpenetrates everything CMMyWhm simuitantously.

Thcrc arc some theologians who are btgimring to understand that the \"Lord\" mentioned m the Bible was not one \"Lord\", but one of many \"Lords\", or \"Creators\". Some were angry and jealous (The Jehovah Group), and some had other psychdogical modes (The Elohim, Yahweh, etc). Service to Others and Service to Self while Serving the Creator All expressions of lifeforms are a Service to that which created them. That service tends to be in two primary forms: Service to your Creator through Service to Others, and Sdct to your Creator through Sdce to the Self. Neither of these modes arc accurately looked upon as being \"right\" or \"wrong\" - that wouid involve a judgment process. Recently (and there are articles elsewhere m Matrix IV to support this) scientists have codinned to themsehm the cxistcnce of both \"whitc light\" and \"dark light\" m the structure of spiral galaxies. We and the planet at this time are experiencing and Serving primasity within a \"white light\" spiral.

Great mushroom shaped clouds asctnded into the quaking sky, and upon the ground thcrc was naught but devastation, rubble of stones, melted rocks, and the incredible debris of human habitation in decay. By night the area shone with a sickly purple radiance. Very few escaped the holocaust. FoIlowing this salutary warning, it was decided to withdraw all the Gardeners from the face of the Earth and to have no more contact with the natives, but to treat them as specimens ftorn afar. Patrols would stdl enter the atmosphere. The world and its natives would still be supervised, but with no official contact. Instead, it was decided to have upon the Earth natives who had been spec trained and who could be planted where people could find them. The man who later became known as Moses was an e.uample. .4 suitable native women was removed ftom the Earth and impregnated with the see havmg the necessary characteristics. The unborn child was telepathically trained and given great - for a native - knowledge. He was hypnotically conditioned not to reveal the knowledge until an appointed time. In due course the baby was born and further training and conditioning was given. Later, the baby was placed in a suitable container and under cover of darkness was deposit- ed securely in a bed of reeds where he would be speedily found. As he grew to manhood he was frequently in touch with us. When necessary a small ship would come to a moun- tain and be concealed by the natural clouds or even by those which we made oursehxs. The man Moses would then ascend the mountain and come aboard, leaving after with a Wand of Power or specralty complied Tablets of the Commandments which we prepared for him. But, this was still not enough We had to go through a similar procedure in other counmes.

Thus it ever was upon the Earth; a coke of men, self-styled priests? would edit or rcwritt scriptures that their own powers and wealth should be enhanced. There were others who founded new branches of religion, such as Mahomet, Confucius - the namm are too many to mention. But each of these men was under our control, or trained by us with the basic intention that a world belief should be established; the leaden of that religion would then lead their foIlowers into good ways of life.

As he correctiy stated, many of the lower classes would reject automatically the words of such a highclass person. Thus it was that search was madey ht using the Akashic Record, for a suitable woman to bear a son. The consen- sus of opinion bred a young woman who was childless and married to a practitioner of the oldest trade on the trade of carpenter. The Wise Ones reasoned that the majority of pcaple were of this class ad thcy may be wdiq to fonow the words of one of their own. So, the woman was visited by one of us whom she took to be an angel, and told that she was to have am honor- that she was to bear amale child to was to found anew religion. In the fidiness of time the woman became pregnant, and the woman and her husband had to flee their home because of the persecmion of a local king. 'They made their slow way to a middle eastern city and them the woman found that her time was full upon her. There the baby was bom. We had fonowed the fli& wad to take ail necessary action. Three memb of the crew of the vigilant vessel descended to the surf'' of the Earth and made their way to the stable. To their dismay, they heard that the ship had been seen and was described as a Star in the East. The baby grew into buy- hood, and through the special indoctrmation he constantiy rtceived by telepathyy he showed great promise. As a youth he would dispute with his elders and regreftab& he antagonized the local priesthood. In eady manhood he withdrew fiom those he knew and traveled to many other lands in the middle and far east. We directed him to travel to Tikt, and he crossed the mountain range and sojoumed for a time in the Cathedral of Lhasa, where ewen now prints of his hands are presewed. Here he rtccived advice and assistance in the formaon of a religion suitable for western peoples. During his stay in Lhasa, he underwent special treatment in which the astral body of the Earth-human was fked and taken away to another existence.

At last emxydmg was ready, and he made the long journey back to his home- land, where he was successful in recruiting certain acquaintances who would assist with the dissemination of the new rehgon. Unf~~unately, the first occupant of the body had antagonized the priests. Thcy remembered the fact and carefully arranged an incident under which the man could be arrested. We considered effecting a rescue, but came to the conclusion that the overall result would be bad for the general population and for the new religion. The new form of spilitual discipline spread, but once again there were those who subverted it to their own ends. About sixty years after its inception a he convention was held m the middle east city of Constantinople. Here many priests gathered, many of them perverted men who had depraved sexual desires and who looked upon heterosexuality as unclean. Under their majority vote, the real teachings were altered and made women appear unclean. They now taught, quite erroneously, that all children were born m sin. They decided to publish a book about the events of sixty years before. Wrhers were hired to compile books on the same lines using as far as possiblc thc tales and legends which had been passcd down, with all their inaccuracies, fiom person to person. Year after year, various committees sat to ed& delctc and alter passages which did not please them. Evmtualty a book was written which did not teach the real Belief, but which was in effect advertising material to enhance the power of the priesthood. Throughout the centuries which followed the priests, who should have been assisting the development of Mankind, actively hindered it. False legends have been propagated and the facts distorted. \" And From \"The Cave of the Ancients\" . . . * * . . . This was the world of long long ago. When the world was very young.

Politicians fought each oh, and the world was a dividcd camp m which each side coveted the lands of the other. Suspicion and fear were the clouds under which the ordmary man lived.

In a third evolutionary transcendence, the new members would similarly engage: (I) other metanormally developing individuals; (2) the physical-biological- human worlds in which they arose; and (3) the supernature they would ac- tivate. 0 New kinds of structure in each evolutionary domain often appear with great suddenness in relation to the subsequent duration of such structures. The first hydrogen atoms appeared, for example, in a period infinitesimally brief in comparison to the many billion years that have since elapsed; and presumably the first iron atoms were created in a particular supernova. Similarly, the first living cells on Earth appeared during a time-span that was comparatively short in relation to the 4-billion-year history of organisms on this planet; and animal species advanced to homo sapiens by a series of developmental jumps charac- terized by Simpson and other evolutionary theorists as \"quantum evolutionyy or by ~ldrid~e and Gould in terms of equilibrium.\" Metanormal ca- pacities, too, often appear with great suddenness, though their integrated real- lzatton takes more tlme to achme. 0 Though inorganic, biological, and human forms develop by gradual steps from one type or stage of activity to the next, their development is also marked at times by sharp discontinuities. New elements are created suddenly, for exam- ple, in exploding stars. New species have not appeared by smoothly continuous stages, and thus have left many gaps in their fossil records. And metanormal capacities often appear to be discontinuous from their analogues in ordinary human functioning: mystical cognition, for example, is markedly different from ordinary mental activity; and unitive awareness of other people is funda- mentally distinct (to those who experience it) from mere empathy for one's fellows. As they arise, new structures, whether particles, atoms, molecules, cells, indi- vidual humans, or cultures, are integrated into the dynamic interactions of their respective domains-or they vanish. At each evolutionary level, those that fit survive.

Wtra-izrtk eonttpts (WE&) (c) 1993 Leading Edge Research Group In Part I (L.E.16J) we discussed the general overview of our concept of Unified Field Theory & The Interaction of Takyons with Consciousness In a UF Closed System. Here we will discuss the mathematical foundations behind these concepts in a simplified form. This approach to mathematics may sound sacrilegous to orthodox scientists, because it is (a) Radically different in it Conceptual Basis and (b) It is extremely simple! The Mathematical Basis of Unified Field Theory In the original formulation of Einstein's Special Relativity Theory(SRT), a set of 6 equations appeared that revolutionised the scientific community and the world in gen- eral, because it established (a) a new basis of perception and (b) incorporated the observer as an integral part of the phenomena in the system being considered. These equations appeared in a paper by Prof. C. Feinberg,\"Particles that Go Faster than Lightn in \"Scientific American\", Feb. 1970. Equation (b) is the world famous eq- uation that every schoolboy and housewife knows today. Equation (a) shows the energy of a particle travelling at speed v but less than the speed of light c. Equation (c) postulates and allows travel of a particle of- )r faster than light(FTL1. The key that allows such an event is that the mass of the article be IMAGINARY, since by definition m =fl p or simply m = ip where i =&. In very simple terms the mean- ing of these 3 equations is that a so-called \"real\" particle of \"realn rest mass m can only travel under the speed of light c. This includes all known \"realn particles of modern Quantum Physics, namely, electrons, protons, neutrons, positrons, etc. -- the entire particle zoo! However, if a particle is not \"realgg, has no nrealn mass, but is imaginary, then it can travel at a speed greater than light,^, yet always faster than light, c, per equation (c) . But, it can travel faster than light, not at the speed of light, for otherwise its energy becomes infinite, and equations (a) and (c) as well as all of physics and their Nobel Prizes collapse! This strange particle, mysterious critter that by its mere existence threatens the sacrosanct tenets of physics is none other than the TAKYON! Now that we have established unequivocally that the Great Einstein Himself predicted and postulated FTL in his SRT master equations, we now proceed to interpret the true meaning and implications of mathematical equations (31, (b) and (c). 2 To wit, E,= mc means thatzEnergy and Mass are equivalent, and are equal when m is multiplied by the factor c . We call it a factor, not a constant, because the speed of light , c,is not constant, as Soviet scientists found,irating western dowatists. (Col.Thomas E. Bearden masterfully presented this research in his various papers) Secondly, it alsopeans that Energy and Light are equivalent,and equal when Light in Motion squared, c , is multiplied by the factor m2 the rest mass of a particle. 2 Thirdly, dividing both sides of equation (c) by c ve obtain the expression q = E/c . This last equation means that when one divides ENERGY by LIGHT IN MOTIOIO SWARED one obtains mass! Therefore, mass, gross matter as we know it, derives from the division of Energy by Light. In Other words, when Light divides Energy, Mass results. Rephrasing mathematically, HASS IS ENERGY PllJLTIPLIED BY LIGHT RECIPROCAL SQUARED or 1 simply expressed m = Eox l/cZ where l/cZ is the reciprocal of Light SquaredILRSI."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV we must pause here to indicate that this mamemaricauy non-rigwrous approach is in- deed imperative to invoke in favour of higher order rigour, namely, Pure Reason, Cam- non Sense & Logic, not %athematical logicm, but Phenwenological Logic. Yoving now to eq. (c) we infer that the constraint imposed by eq. (a1,that \"real\" m cannot travel at or greater than c, is eliminated when the mass is imaginary, p . It follows imediately from these mathematical arguments that the TAKYON is indeed an imaginary particle that travels faster than c, and only faster than c, or else! Here - de mean imaginary that it is not in the real but the imaginary realm of numbers. Rt this point, it is imperative to briefly discuss the concept of Real & Imaginary Rmbers, RR & IR, respectively. RNs are (not nurses please!)all those numbers that can be ascribed to items in the \"real world\", such as apples, oranges, money,etc. They are based on the fact that the square root of a positive number is real and it exists in the real world. Example: $6 = 2,m = 5, your salary is the square root of the eual net profit of the corporation:~~l,6~,000,000 = $40,00O/year &4 Taxes! Dn the other hand, Ills are those numbers which have no real roots, such as the numbers used on all advanced physics, relativity, electrical engineering, etc. Examp- le:-= ? ,-= ? These are define by defining tha -1 = i (i=imaginary).There- iT 0, = 2, = 5, = i = i and ixi=i = -1. Simple, right? You run into trouble if you have to pay your electric bill in real nmbers/dollars - of $55/m and you are unemployed and only have an imaginary salary of $4O1000/year. To close, according to mathemetics and physics, RNs exist in the \"real world\", where- as Ilis exist only in the IHAGIRATIOB, the \"unreal worldn. lbst if not all of today's High Technology is based on mathematics involving both mups of RRs & as, the whole group being termed COMPLEX mJMBERS. It is standard Practice to use only the Real cmponent and to ignorddiscard the Imaginary campon- ent of all equations, especially in Electmmagnetics and Applied Electricity Theory. This is a cardine if not fatal error, because it has been found that the so-called hmgimry Compontnts of the Electrwa@etic Waves-RF, TV,tlicrpwave, ELF,etc--are Strongly PSICHOA IVE. That is, they affect/interact with the Ps+,lnfrastructure of hunans, 7iid% an' s and plants. Refer to The Cbntauk Projectm by P. Nichols and esw ecially to Ch. 7 of Matrix III by V. Valerian for a detailed discussion of this topic.

Conceptually, since RNs and \"real components\" of all e- quations interact and affect the \"Real World\", the implication is that \"real\" energy, mass, electric charge, electric power, & radioactivity can and does affect \"realnmass ect mass-to-mass or energy-to-mass, mass-to-energy & energy-to-energy action.

Lambrakis, Ph.D. 2lltrii-Eek cE;oncepts (EUEC) (c) 1994 Leading Edge Research Group MATHEMATICS AND GEOMETRY OF THE IMAGINATIOI: THE CONCEPTUAL BASIS OF UNIFIED FIELD THEORY In 1932 a book was published titled Anschaulishe Gemetry by the eminent professors David Hilbert and S. Cohn-Vossen that is to mathematics what relativity is to physics. In 1952 it was translated in English under Geometry and the Imagination. This great classic by the eminent Hilbert, of Hilbert Space fame in modern Quantum Mechanics, was the mentor of John Von Neumann, one of the 3 mathematical geniuses that could fully understand Einstein's Relativity Theory.(The other 2, reportedly, were Prof. Henri P~incab~and God!)We are talking in particular about Tensor Matrix Calculus or Non-Euclidian Geometry, the geometry of Curved Space, Hyperdimensional Geometry. The book at the outset indicates that intuitive understand- allow greater grasp of what is being studied or contemplated over mathematical abstraction based on pure logic alone. The book presents the geometry of Euclid, Gauss 8 Riemann(Curved Space) in its visual and intuitive aspect. Thus, the mathematical foundations for hyperdim- ensional physics were established as early as 1932, especially in Lattice/Matrix mod- el of Space(Crystallography), Space-Time Curvature, and Topology, the bending and twisting of space by the IMAGINATION via mathematical abstractions and patience! Inasmuch as Einstein's Special & General Relativity (SR/GR) deal with macroscopic systems, -tun Mechanix(OM) deals the microscopic world--the microcosm. The Hermetic Equation: \"As Above, So Belar; 4s Within, So Withoutw does seem to run into conflicts when physicists get involved in trying to reconcile observational phen- omena in both worlds. The world of OM seems to be a very strange, almost l'unrealn one! The Father of Quantun Theory was the eminent Max Planck that laid its foundations in 1900 with his famous equation E = h3 , which states that the energy of a radiating body is a function of a ~ature. Constant h, ( Planckvs Constant) and it frequency of vi- bration ,Y . All Electromagnetic Energy is radiated this way: Heat, Light, X-Rays, Cosmic Rays, Electromagnetic Waves(Radio,TV, Radar,etc.), yet attenuate with distance. In 1926, the genius Erwin Schfidinger published in A-, 79,361, the most celebrated equation of physics Since Planck & Einstein, namely, the Schrijdinger Qua- tion (SE). This divinely inspired equation is the foundation of modern W. This SE is the most cryptic of all OM equations, because it predicts 2 very paradoxical phenomena of nature, namely (a) Particles can be both Corpuscles or Waves, and (b) even though the equation requires continuous functions, it predicts discontinuous solutions or very discrete energy levels in atomic structures, same being allowed,idden. The allowed, discrete levels are knaun as EIGENFUNCTIONS; the SE introduced the concept of the Wave Function, , and its mysterious irn lication, the Wave Function Collapse. Schr6dinger himself did not know what the term % was, and he initially called it the mysterious Field Scalar. It took 3 years till Max Born realised it'wis a Wave Wction, We will interpolate extracts fmxn various sources to illustrate these paradoxes, start- with the late Nobelist Prof. Richard Feyrnuan."},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV - This brief introduction to the foundations of a is imperative to understand the current thoughts in the orthodox scientific community about the Concepts of reality, and the con- ceptual basis of modern physics' search for Unified Field Theories,albeit I1Grand1* ones. The next step is to glean further meaning from how OM conceptualises or \"sees1' reality, or better yet, how physicists/scientists define REALITY today. As that may take an eter- nity, the reader is referred to the superb book by Dr. Nick Herbert \"Quantmn Realitym. Meanwhile, we will summarise 4 major schools' concepts today needed in our endeavour; this has to do with the controversial \"measurement problem\" thct collapses the wave function. (A) Copenhagen or \"Bohr\" School. This is the accepted, orthodox interpretation. Here Macro- scopic apparatus can't be talked in OM terms. The wave function does not collapse as such, but is merely postulated that it does in the measuring instrument. Thus, only the act of measurement changes uncertainty into certainty, per Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. (B) Consciousness or Von Neumann School. The great mathematician Von Neumann stated that since the SE does not predict the properties of physical systems as definite, and since consciousness is only aware of observing definite systems, then the interaction of physi- ical systems with Consciousness is what causes the wave function collapse. (C) Hidden Variables or Boh School. The SE does not contain all variables describing a physical system. There are also \"Hidden Variables\" required to describe a Quantum System. These variables determine the extert to which collapses in any individual measurement. (Dl Consciousness as Hidden Variables or Walker School. The military researcher Evan Walk- er pointed out that all other theories left entirely an walysed construct with no fom- a1 theory of consciousness and mechanisms of interaction with physical systems. In 1970, based on the work of Bohm,he developed a theory of Quantum Mechanical Brain Processes as a model of brain-mind interaction. Consciousness is identified as a set of Hidden Varia- bles fundamentally different from Bob's in that they are inaccessible to physical. meas- urements;they are non-local and non-temporal, that is, beyond Space 8 Time. It is these Hidden Consciousness Variables that collapse the wave function of a particle or system. It follows immediately from Bohm and Walker's work that these incammtensurable hidden var- iables are none other than a form of SUBTLE EXERGY, the term Einstein used to describe the concept of the AIRHER when Michelson-Morley failed to detect its existence. To this day the term coined by Einstein has \"stuckn, specially in New Age 8 Metaphysical jargon. It is quite clear from what we have discussed thus far that physicists cannot, are not able to or don 't want to risk their reputations trying to define Consciousness and its effect on particles, physical systems or reality, in general, because they can't define reality, that is, what is \"realw and what really means \"IMAGINARYm other than an abstract and conveninet mathematical tool to sove difficult equations invented by Euler in 1770. Yet, how can orthodox science hope to formulate a Grand Unified Field Theory (GUT) by rel- ying only on physical concepts of reality? It is time they started to listen to other scientists, such as the brilliant and astute Dr. Deepak Chopra, M.D., who has intuitive- ly figured out that the unifying parameter required for any Unified Field Theory is none other than CONSCIOUSHESS!CR~~~~ to Dr. Chopra1s article \"Who Are You?\" L.E.#64/Dec 931 It is a pity that orthodox scientists have not yet understood the redl meaning of the so- called Imaginary Nmnbers: numbers that exist in the IMAGINATION!.

We invoke only Common Sense, Pure Reason and Simplicity--a practice foreign to orthodox science. REALITY: Everything that we experience via our Physical or Non-Physical/Imer Senses. This includes external physical objects, things or elements(wind,fire, cold,etc.) Also, it includes all inner states, such as Wtions, Feelings, Dreams & Perceptions. Who can pos- sibly deny that what we feel or experience inwardly is unreal? Only a materialist fool! REAL SPACE: That expanse that we experience with our Inner or Outer Senses. Any perception of expansion or contraction having physical objects, elements & thinns that can be touched, felt or measured is Real Space. By unanimous agreement. this includes the so-called physical or external world. This includes Wall Street + Disneyland--same thing! IMAGINARY SPACE: That infinite expanse that we experience in our IMAGINATION exclusively. This space is truly infinite, and is the space where everything exists before it material- ises into the external or Real Space. This includes Wall Street + Disneyland when it was merely an imaginary ideal, a mere blueprint in Consciousness. Paradoxically, this Imagin- ary Space is more than the so-called Real Space. Can you deny the reality ofnBeing in in-love\"or the Wonderful Fantasies in a child's mind? Only if you are a stupid fool! CONSCIOUSNESS: The Flux Continurn of Holographic Infinite Information that derives fraD Purelbught. Pure Thought is GOD-This is a truly fundamental & generalised definition of Consciousness, for it allows for Consciousness not coupled to organic, inorganic mass or mass in general. It allows for Consciousness coupled to non-material, imaginary entities such as TAKYOAS and Interdimensional, Non-Incarnate Entities, like Casper the Ghost! Pure Reason informs us that by these 4 definitions everything derives fran Consciousness! The astute reader will notice that these are unique, new concepts intrinsic to UTC's un- ique approach to UFT. In other words, the starting point is Imaginary Math & Geametry. Why? Because unification of all energies/forces in nature start in Consciousness/Mind. In 1923 Prf. Eddinton said \"time is a mental constant of our private consciousness ...\" The great Einstein himself said in 1941 \"time and space are modes by which we think and not conditions in which we live.\" Clearly, those words have been terribly ignored today! Our premise,UTCmS, for a LlET is that Consciousness is the unifying factor of all fundament- al forces/energies of nature, as intuited by Dr. Deepak Chopra, who irated a physicist in his lecture when he made such pronouncement. Bravo, Dr. Chopra! We agree, categorically! Furthermore, mass--gross matter--cannot be the origin of such fundamental unification, for it has to occur at a level that precedes the manifestation of matter in the physical plane. This excludes g known particles and forces of the QM zoo. Even the brilliant mav- erick Col. Thomas Bearden avoids the use of the term TAKPONS and plays safe by postulat- ing gravitons, gravitinos, neutrinos and solitons who are still luminally bound to the speed of light, c, and the realm of gross matter. Where do Gravitons(Coup1ed Photons) and Photons come from? From the excitation of sub-atomic particles. And where do sub-atomic particles come from? From Energy! And where does Energy come from? From electromagnetic radiation from particles! Can you see the dog chasing its tail? Everything ultimately der- ives from mass, according to orthodox QM and even Relativity! Same oll,same 01' concepts. Recycled Ignorance! Therefore, as shown in Table 1, Part I[L.E.# 65/Jan 941, we state our fundamental postul- ate that unification, hence Unified Field Theory, starts in CONSCIOUSNESS and is independ- ent of mass, yet mass depends on UF Energy for its very existence. The last realm or tres- - hold where Energy exists as such in a negative state, before particles materialise in this physical plane is the DIRAC SEA or VACUUM, where the imaginary becanes nrealn-materialises! Perhaps now the reader can understand why TAKYONS, those lawless, imaginary-massless, super- luminal critters originate in the imagination and travel in Imaginary Space undetected by our most sonhisticated instruments. Hence, they don't exist! Can you -. imagine that nonsense?"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Some Questions . . . 1.

The result was that they could come up with a better answer to a problem as a group. The ikoughfom groups, when they would align and do this procedure, would come up with answers that were really phenomenal.

When you located that belief having its origin within the mass consciousness, anyone who participated in that mass consciousness recognized it. This was one of the Lines of research. We packaged l%ougkistwnr and sold it as a game, a process and as a means for companies to plan out their flrtures. Sensory Deprivation Experiments The other line of research that we were doing involved sensory d@va&m in- side special chambers, which contained a very concentrated solution of Epsom salts.

There is no sound because it is totally sound proof. The only thing going on there is the \"circus of the mind\". Everything quiets down and then the \"three-ring circus\" starts. Anyway, in observing this ucircus\" one day I noticed that there seemed to be this \"stoppern or \"plug\" in the center ring of the circus. Being somewhat curious"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV about this, I went over and \"pulled the plug\". The first thing that happened was that the \"ring\" disappeared into the hole, followed by everything else. Only consciousness itself remained. Even the idea \"I AM\" was just a baliefthat floated away. Out of these two research Ihes, I came up with this process in which someone could be shown how to \"pull the plugn. I WOW on it for three or four weeks along with my staff of nine people - two of whom are with me tonight. I took each staff member and I put them through this process. All of them experienced this \"falling away\" of the barriers to pure consciousness. They all loved it The only problem was tbat we were supposed to be a center that was doing something. Everyone stopped producing. It took four people to make a cup of tea Everyone would stand around and laugh. The phone would ring and nobody would answer it This went on for about two week until I could key them back in. We had the process, but it was such a powerful process that you had to set it up so a person could 'create a reality\" before he or she would be put into the process In other words, show them how to create their preferred realii before the rug was pulled out from under them That was what frnally resulted in the Avaka materials and the Avatar Progrllll~ The process only takes a short period of time to accomplish Preparing to do it, however, takes three or four days. The \"plug\" consisted of a certain \"truth\", and it is the onZv \"truthn that I have ever been able to find that is not part of a baliefsysterrr The \"truthn is that you ape- rbce Mot you bdiGve It's not the other way around. Your beliefs determine your experience. If you. have ever bought into the illusion that you could derive your bclicfi from the study of rea@v or qcrience, you're probably in your body backwards. - That's a joke, but it's like looking in a mirror. It's a joke for some. The interesting thing about this 'truth\" (you experience what you beliwe) is that if you do not believe that it is so, you experience it as being \"false\" - which proves it is so. Do you want to go through that again? All right You qaiarce whrrtyou befin,~. Ifyou bdiGvc drat * is not dre case, you experience it as \"not being dke fad\", W&IL in am vcrjlies it as being tnre. It is sort of a play on words, but anything else involves a belief s-vstem. Every other \"truth\" is basically somebody saying, 'my experience is in accordance with my beliefs, therefore its true\". Then you say, \"what's false?\". What is false is \"it doesn't look the way I believe it ought to\", or 'what I am experiencing is not what I beliwe I'm experiencing\". An-my, this was the \"plug\" on it. Beings who had cre- ated problems for themselves had done so because of their beliefs Beliefs were the key. A being that was believing that \"there's something wrong with me\" experienced the reality where \"there's something wrong with me\". He could look forever within that reality to try to flnd out %at was wrong with him\" and he would never find it What was wrong with him was that he had the belief \"there's something wrong with me.\" It was so simple. It seems that \"beliefs\" exist within \"beliefs\" exist within\" beliefs\". Different levels of consciousness. One level of.consciousness creates a \"reality\", and then a being exists within this \"reality\" that's created by that level of consciousness. He perceives everything \"insiden that level of consciousness as 451"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV 'something he can changen, Uprocesses that he can interact ~fth\", Wags that he can tbink about or do something about\", but the oe of consciousness is immutable realm.

What was happeni. in Avcltra is tht as beis expanded and their consciousness got wider and wider and they explored more 'bellelSW, more and more of lt was lnternaltzed and less wes pro- jected. Tbere is a quote in the UpMirkd tbat sqys something like \"He who confuses inside and outside and sees them as different, goes forever from sorrow to sorrow.\" When you set a certain level of consciousness and then deem it to be \"objective d- W, as opposed to \"subjective reality\" within, you start on the cycle of going fhm birth to birth. Tbe that the Avotorp- was dlowing a Beii to do was to go Into the state of pure consciousness where all \"other beings\" were \"identities\" that were being shared by consciousrress, and that all the 'events of the world\" were the product of \"belief systems\" held in the mass consciousness. We were originally right at the point wbere we were discovering the wr+cepir and tinking processes Now, we're at the point where we can 'create\" or \"dis-createn them. The word \"discrerrte n means to cease a&g so-. What Avatar opened the door to was the ability for a Being to 'createn or \"discreate\" his \"beliefs\". Experience reflecting that would immediately follow. The fvst lwel tbat would be hit was the one where they would start exploring different \"belief\" systems. Do you know what the primarv ran is? ?&e ph-pkd Ubersc It's a belief system - a religion. We are all parishioners in it. Most of us The Avatar program is a straightforward thing. It doesn't depend on a \"guru\". It is the end of \"guru-ship\" and the need for \"masters\". It returns you to the point where you are the source of your life. You create it at will. You choose the \"beliefs\" that you prefer. You experience the \"reality\" that you prefer. The bt exercise that a person does in the course opens a perception channel to the physical universe that most people are only vaguely aware of aad some are not aware of at all. It takes about an hour, and it changes the way one perceives the ph-mica1 universe - often radically. The second exercise is that one learns to meate a dty without any wllllLtCT iazkmhn - without an-ything else occuring. If you've wer said to yourself \"well, I'm going to do this\", and immediately fifty thoughts arise in your mind (the circus starts) about \"well, should I do this now?\", etc - that's the second exercise. It produces the ability to create a reality at will. It's a rough exercise tbat tabs fwe or six hours, but one ex- periences tremendous change while undergoing it. The third exercise has to do with ~cI)Ic~o~.~ We experience our judgement, which are the \"beliefs that we place on things\". Two people will experience the same event, and for one of them its just \"another event\" and for the other it will \"min their life\". The difference is the judgement thw place on the event So, this allows a person to basically suspend his judgement of mything he's experiencing and returns the ability to explore experience without resistance. It opens the door so you can experience your existence as the grand spiritual master you really are."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"At that point, there is a demonstration session that is given that is similar to the original \"plug pulling\". It allows a person to re-gain the ability to create or dis- create beliefs at will. From that point on, the person \"solos\" the procedure on several \"rundowns\". The first \"run-down\" is called body )an&, and involves the dis- creation of all beliefs that support connection to a physical body. At that point you are a dis-incarnate being in sort of a \"dream reality\". It takes one to four hours, and what happens when a person picks up on the perceptions and sensations that he has actually been hsdhg in the body .... see, the illusion is that they are comingfiom 18 w, but you experience what you b&mw rather than the other wy around. When a person picks up on these, the body is no longer held out of adjustment or out of harmony, and when he puts back the sensation and the attachment to the body that he chooses to have, the body starts to realign itself, sometimes drastically. The second \"rundown\" has to do with idcnlrires . . . Apparentty, what we do is that we all have this \"closet of costumes\" that we cany around. What we actually \"relate to\" are these \"costumes\". We meet someone and we offer them a \"costume\". Beiis are actually changing every moment If you can't get a beii to wear one of your \"costumes\", you don't know what's going on at aU When you get along very well with a being and have high affi, It's generally because they are willing to wear one of your \"costumes\" and you are willing to wear one of ikeb \"costumesn. In ac- tuality, you are relating to your own \"doset of costumes\", not to the otber being. This one of the things that the \"identity\" handles. You empty the closet of \"costumesn and the most miraculous thing happens - it a thing that brings people to tears. For maybe the fvst time in their whole Earthly existence, they perceive the existence of another being as they really are, with no \"costume\". The third \"run-down\" has to do with &&&OIPS. If you have explored any sort of spiritual path at all, you are probably am that we set limitations on ourselves. In our own speech patterns, we say \"I can't do this\" and then we wonder why we can't do it and see it as bei true. We express the bdiefthat we couldn't, and we couldn't On that \"run-down\" you handle any limitations that are interfering with what it is that you would like to do. What actually excites you. You don't handle all limitations, because some of them may serve you. If you handle all of them, you just sort of dissolve into boundless consciousness (which is not \"bad\", but it doesn't get anything \"done\"). So, you set limitations on what you are willing to experience. You limit what you will let your attention be applied to. You limit what you will spend your time on. You start to acheive a focus in your life. The fourth \"run-down\" is called p ersisrent mass hm&ng, which involves the handling of &sires.. comptrlsio~ts~ p emktenf rrmsses. pains andpressures that may be affecting a person in such a way that they feel \"out of control\"."},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The fifth u~-down\" is called Universe had&.

If you think of an octopus and imag&e that we are 4 in the Ytoes\" of the oc- topus, and that there was some one to discreate all of the identities and separations that keep you from going into the mass consciousness, and then have some procedure where you could go down into another \"be\" of the octopus and experience another beii - that's the description of nniverse proccss.

If he does something that would be considered \"bad\" or Yharmful\" to another person, he actually starts to people his Universe with people that \"deserve\" that sort of an ac- tion, so he has to live witb these poor creatures that he has harmed - his Universe goes down hill in a burry.

A little more research suggests that financing for the lkosqhcal Society inevitably came from the Rothschilds Now that's funny, the same we behind the New.Vml4 Oder are behind the ?New Age\" movement?

Bill Cooper emotionally identifies the true nature of the national and international conspiracy through documentation of an extensive historical network of secret societies. The OverView holds the position that Bill's entry into the \"New Agen movement in the late 1980's was a catalyst to its pcscnt direction. which is moving towards a more realistic. logical apprmch lately. Bill's Mysfery Bubylon radio series about secret societies is of monumental historical impatance in what it accomplishes, and Th OHLrVino rsownmends that the reader make all efforts to obtain it. In fact, we recommend all of Bill's works. regardless of the subject. However. Bill seems to profess allegiance to Jesus and the BiMe. and considering the nature of his nsearch into secret societies and religions throughout history, Ttrc OwerView is surprised that he has apparently not come upon information which would identify the true origin of that belief system. William Guy Carr had identified the details of the national and intcmational conspiracy in the 1950's. but did so under the banner of the National Fedemtion of Chriaian Laymen, and was also a believer in the Bible and Jesus Christ Baigent, high and Lincoln present imfutabie arguments into the origins and history of the Ordcr Of Zion. the Knights Templar and modem Freemasonry. but they almost seem like a publicity firm for those nefarious organizations, as they have failed to sufficiently expldre in detail the misguided premises and the heinous actions which these organizations have perpetrated on us throughout history. Charles Fort seems to have been the modern day originator of the theory to which The OvcrVim. Cdds regarding the control of the plarei Earth thoughout history by an alien military- governorshp, though he presents it in a simplistic manna. Erich von Daniken backs up that tkny with archedogical evidence similar to Sitchin. but goes overboard sometimes. Eustace Mullins has done some of the best research ever done in history into the Federal We, the Wdd Order and New World Order ownership of the world. but Eustaa is radically anti-Judaic, anti-hom06e~uai, and is apparently a white supmnacist or scpatatia Philip Marsh has dom excellent work in authoring books regarding the inanne tax laws(?) and nmning The Liberty Fcwndation, however, the amounts of money asked for basic information packets to restore individuals back to sovereign citims and to liberate them from the illegal incune tax laws are way beyond the reach of the average American, and raise questions about the true motives involved. in fact, the impdon one gets upon becoming involved with The Libelty Fmundation is that saving money is the primary gd. not saving America through the exposure of an unconstitutional. illegal. renegade federal agency.

Nesta Webskr sbows dy a slight anti-Judaic, pnchristian slant in ha writings, as far as 27u OvrtView is conafned, and we recammend her works wholeheartedly. Jaoques Vallee, who has authored many skeptical, debunking books about the UFO section of the \"New Agew movement, provides the naive participant in the movement with the necessary logical skepticism to slwive relatively unscathed emotionally. Vallee presents an impeccable logic to his arguments in pointing out the spurious elements of modern UFO research specifically, but has been affiliated with J. Allen Hynek, who was involved in sane of the first international intelligence elite cover-ups of UFO sightings. An example of Vallee's apparent agreement with the agenda of Hynek is his outright rejection of Bill Cooper, who llre OvcrView supports fully. The information from Randolph Winters about Billy Meier shows that Meier has been in contact with some type of life forms, exactly what we cannot be sure. His work gives us perspective for skepticism, shows us potential mind-control on the part of the New World Orderers and the alien military-governorship, and could actually be true, in the end. However, Meier's claim of being the direct illcarnation of Immanuel the Nazarean, or Jesus Christ (Winters says that Meier claims that he disoovmd this through inspection of his Akashic records, and Overview accepts that he believes his claim, though we may not) shows under closer inspection that if Meier is correct, then he is clearly an enslaved spiritual being who has been used ova a paid of many incamations by an alien society to further their pu~poses. Mng Edge Research Group with Valdamar Valerian (that's a person) provides same of the most cxcdlent detailed spiritual and technical information available to individuals on the plane today. Some in the \"New Agew movement might be concerned by a possible connection herp to secret societies, however, the work found in Leading Edge Ncwsletkr and the Matrir series of books is invaluable to the bonest seeker of Universal truth. The Liberty Lobby and The Sporlight arc, believe it or not, financed by fonner German Bundists Believe it or not again, a lot of their work is actually pretty good, as they have shielded most of their antiJudaism behind a large dose of Constitutionalism and anti-Zionism (more palatable sina even the U.N. has denounced Zionism as racism), though they still deny the establishment history of the Holocuusf, and we agree with them. The Institute Of Historical Review, a similar backed aganizaton, has also dam sane excellent work in uncovering historicad truth. even if it does put Gmnany in a better light, specifically regarding the Holocuust, but as much dating to other amas whm hislory has been written as propaganda fa the winners. Cosmic Awarcms Communications dlers much worthwhile spiritual, social and political information, but its editor clearly exhibits some of the prejudices associated with the secret societies and the American political right wing. 23e Overview holds the position that Cosmic Awareness Communications is a child of the CIA MK-Ultra exptriments of the Ws, 60's and 70's that may or may not still be under the control of the internationai intelligence elite or some .alien intelligence project, but they still manap to present usable, worthwhile Universal and conspiratorial infomation, although new presenting a plan of action which could immediately be used to free he enslaved spiritual beings of the planet, though they continually and.insistwtly claim to be of arch a source which could do sa llre OVprView also highly recommends Arcturus Bodr Scrvia as a so- of \"New Agew mataials, if you can take Bob Girard's acabic barbs! And that's the good news. Several other \"New Agew movement sources arc spurious at best, if not directly participant in the alien infiltration and control which exists on this planet now and into the ancient past; Sharula and Shield Dux of Telos Enterprises claim to be descendants of survivors of the continent of Mu, who escaped to the city Telos under Mt. Shasta which is the city of the high priests of Mu. They also claim that Count St. Germain is affiliated with this group and with a se called Gala& Fedemtion Of Planets, which is affdiated with the subterranean cities of the planet. and that a flying saucer base exists at Mt. Shasta, all run by the priests of a seat society known as the Order Of TIte Melchizedec. This galactic confederation is supposedly one of those organizations fighting for control of the spiritual and material resources of the planet, supposedly belongs to the Golactic Council which has authorized the present policy regarding the piamt Earth, and have used their own policy of supposed rmn-interfenma to allow and perpetuate the military- governorship, so Lhey must also be identified as alien conspirators. The information about the high"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"MATRIX I\\' --- priests of Mu escaping to build an underground city at Mt Sham seems accurate. Churchward identifies a sect on Mu known as the Naacais, who were the high priests and who spread the teachings of Mu to ha colonies. The Churchward information anrelates some of the claims made by the Dux's about Telos, and the arguments of Churchward about the amuption of priesthood matches the same logic used by Brarnley in The Gpds Of Edrn and exposes the fact that these high priests were responsible for the hoarding of Universal infonnation and the creation of mtawnable initiations which caused the civilization to decline because of an apparently intentional plan to deny the people the infonnation naassary to nourish spiritually and matrrially. That same secret society at Mt. Shasta now ridicules the present civilization on the outer shell of the planet and claims that such barbaric people do not deserve to be exposed to the ancient truths, but it was this policy by thase same Naacals which led to the degradation of the people in the first place. Thus the inhabitants of the city of Telos must be identified as very likely being co- amspirators with the alien military-govunor custodians who control the planet As fa Count St. Germain. if he is not still alive and operating on the planet in same form or other. then be was just an international conspirator who aided the international banking community in gaining a foothold in certain counlries in 18th antury Europe. Both Bramley and the Dux's, from their widely varied viewpoints, agree with this fact of cooperation with certain banking families in that antury. Whatever his actions, the present status of the international banking community shows the fruit of his seeds If on the other hand. the daim by Madame H.P. Blavatsky is true, and Count St Gennain is a Tibetan Master residing in and out of body and who secretiy helps amtrd .the world fnm his hideaway in thc HiNayas, then.Count St Germain is a galachc amspirator, as Bramley so clearly shows in his wohk Regardrng Mt Shasta, which The OverView has visited, a group known as the \"I Amw movement was started there in the 1930's by a Guy Ballard. supposedly under the inswction of. guess who, Count St Gmnain, the ascmded master! It seems that many such false sects and religions have been mated under the instruction of the alien military-governorship, and the \"I Am\" mwement, along with its stable of \"ascended mastersw is just another one of those ploys to divert humam from accurate, truthful Universal information. However, claims of flying saucers entering and exiting the mountain over Sargtnts Ridge by town inhabitants and visitors to the town seem accurate, and \"New Agew authors such as William Hamilton, B~oe Walton (Branton) and Commander X have documented same. If you go to visit this mountain. visit and drink from Panther Springs, but be very catciul and wary of the many different characters in the town and who live on or near the mountain. Much \"New Agew channeling goes on, along with supposed \"self-improvementw seminars, which improve the self-discmay of the host even more if they ard up in very intimate, very short-term reiarionships, if you know what we mean! Phil Klass, Stanton Friedmann, Jamie Shandera and William Moore, cuntributordparticipants in UFO related research, are all affiliated with or arc members of the intcmational intelligence elite Bramley does a wonderful job of using Klass* own arguments against him in pointing out the existence of modem alien visitation. Friedmann, Shandera and Mowe were all involved in the rdease of the false Majestic-12 briefing pepas, which wp the red- herring cover-up plan by the intemational intelligence elite in the event of the discovery of Majority-Twclw. Be wary of these individuals when you see them at conferences spond by certain UFO organizations, as the management and participants of many of these organizations have been infiltrated by agents of the international intelligence elite, sud you arc on their tilrf. Friedmann uses the Zionist ploy of attempting to discredit anyom who mentions the Protocol3 Of Zion as anti-Semitic, even if they try to rela& the authorship of that document as not originating in Jlviailmr. 7k OvcrView does not know what to make of Budd Hopiclns, Bob Lazar, and John Lear Jr., all who inhabit the UFO section of the \"New Agew movement These individuals could be members of the intanatid intelligena elite, and they probably arc. The Theosophical Society features the works of Madame HP. Blavatsky, whose feature work was the multi-vdume Thc Secret Docaine. which was based on the stanzas in the Book Of Dzpan While her works present much useful infonnation, they arc wedy lengthy and too detailed for mast people to gain an effective grasp of the concepts involved. Churchward, in his Mu writings, points out that the Book Of Dzym was based on the Sacred lnrpired Writings Of Mu, which found their way along with the some of the Naads into the Himalayas and into the hands of the Tibetan masters after the Aryan Bmhmin caste drove them out of mainland India and which were perverted in their content when transcribed into that book. Once again, much good information is to be found in the worlcs of the Theosophrcal Society, regardless of its funding. Tim Beckley of Inner Light Publications is an individual who 7k OverView believe. is aware of the true nature of the dim inIiltration and intnvention into human affairs, but continues"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV to peddle books and other material designed to cake attention away from actual \"New Age\" truths. it is unclear if this direction has as its source a misguided profit motive, or certain pressures from the international intelligence elite. Either way, Tim has much experience in the field, and it is felt by Thc Overview that he would greatly benefit from honing down his offaiogs in the future to a select, accurate. recommended few to avoid the appeamce of complicity. Bruce Walton (now Branton, since he discovered Jesus and the Bible) was once an energetic, open-minded \"New Age\" researcher whose work deserved attention. However, Bruce has since become Branton. and his work (specifically Thc Enemy Wirtcin) is now interspersed with Bibiical quotations and continued refmnces to Jesus Christ as lord. It is unfortunate that an individual who showed so much potential in his early research has dived into the heart of so much alien propaganda, and cannot use the same dearsighted logic he once used in his work to research into the origins of the Bibie and the Roman Catholic Church and discover and accept the uuths which open-minded research would bring. Branton now uses as his major argument for the validity of the Bib the same symbolism intentionally embedded into the New Testament by its authors, the Roman aristocratic Piso family, as their signature to future generations that it is their work (similar to the symbolism and encoding used by the secret societies), but fails to note the symbdism involved in the fact that the Bible contains 66 books. Best of luck to Bruce in the future. As identified in a previous issue of Thc Overview, the book Thc Keys Of Enoch, which has been a bulwark of the \"New Age\" movement, is a work of disinfonnation authored by an individual who bas void his disagreement with the United Stcltvs Comn'nrtwn and his affiliation with Khazar Zionist internatid elements who are participants in the alien infiltration and intervention. This book accepts definitions and references to the Bible as valid, and presents a dearly Cabalistic viewpoint d spiritual laws, ignoring several critical spiritual renets while getting the der caught up in all sorts of complicated, confusing inionnation designed to take than off thepatboftruh Some organizations and individuals go too far to one side of a viewpoint for our liking. The Sons Of Liberty is too anti-Judaic, and Lindsay Williams is too Biblical Christian for Thc OverView. Gyeorgos Ceres Hatonn is off the scale off the wall, but some good nuggets of information can even be found in hislhcr(?) books. in fact. after having read some material. Thc OvctVim, is still not sure exactly what is Hatann! Unarius Academy Of Science is too gooey with space brotherly love; Thc OverView holds the position that those who believe they will be takm away by the \"space brothers\" as part of the upcoming \"rapture\" will actually end up as the \"batch consignmentw labor for the Moon and Mars bases which we hear about in secret government conspiratorial information. This total acceptance of all the \"space brothers\" is potentially the most dangerous aspect of the \"New Age\" movement, along with channeling, so kt thebuyerbeware Some good radio can be found relating to the \"New Age\" movement and its tangential movements. Specifically, one can find on shortwave radio bands sbws such as Bill Coopcr's Thc Hour Of Thc The, Tom Donahue's Town Forum, Tom Valentine's Radio Free Americu (labeled Radio FreeMasonry by Bill Cooper), Billy Goodman's Billy Goodman Happening, Chuck Harder's For Thc People, Glen L Roberts and Will Dwyer of Full Disclos~ue Radio and Bruce Steven-Hdmes' nmeless Voyager Radio. These shows can be heard on assorted (and always changing!) shortwave radio freqiicncics such as 5.810 mHz (5.595?), 7315 mHz, 7.435 mHz, 9.485 mHz; they touch on all typ of subjeds. and are all recommended. Most if not all of the spiritual and religious aspects of the \"New Age\" movement undercut the basic core tenets of the Roman Catholic Church and Christianity, either subtly or aggressively. This can be sear as being consistent with the goals of the New World Or&r and the Rothscbilds, though much of this informaha is actually probably true. What is known to be me is that the secret societies which control the Earth and interface with the alien military- govanorship worship what the Christian Churches would call \"Lucifer,\" although this entity, instead of being the polarized aspect of the \"Godheadw along with the \"Christw force, is really just a massivdy misguided murdering dia And while Tirc Overview hdds to the position that the major religions of the world are false religions spawned onto the people by agents of the secret societies for the purpose of controlling the masses. Thc Overview also holds to the position that if individual beings wish to choose to worship false reiigions, then that is their unalienable spiritual right, and constitutional right in the United States. Thus we support the right of the masses to worship false religions, as long as that religion w the worship of that religion does not abrogate any unalienable spiritual right w constitutional right of any other religion or individual. However, l7w Overview would prefer if individuals would seek Universal Mth through their own personal initiative. as opposed"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV to leanring fran a religion or secret society. At the same time. The Overview holds the position that the best, most accurate Universal information comes fm the secret doctrine of the-Mystcry ScAoo& (except as to where it is perverted by teachings of abrogations of unalienable individual spiritual rights), as pernaps best presented by Blavarsky, and The Overview believes that we hold the key to the tnre intapretation of many of the symbolic legends of the Myslery SchooLr. The ancient Hebrew faith and Talmudic law. the Roman Catholic Church, and the nation of Islam along with Hinduism and Buddhism are all falst religions created by the samt societies of the aliens for the purpose of continuing to lead the human race away from truthful Universal information. The \"godsw identified in those religions are alien miliuuy-governor custodians, the patriarchs, messiahs a propha of those religians were in direct, continued communication with such alien forces, and specifically, the virgin birth of Jesus Christ (Immanuel the Na;rarean) was an in-vitro fertilization and implantation into the womb of Mary by the aiien military- gwenrorship. Hinduism is an enslaving social class struaure softened up by some \"mysticalw teschings, but has failed to spiritually liberate the masses and was a perversion of the teachings of the Indian Nds (Order Of The MeIchizedec), who after the Brahmin caste learned as much from tban as passible, chased them into the Himalayan mountains, where they became the Tibetan mods who hold onto many of the bent teachings (and who also. by the way, claim that the human race is too barbaric to be presented these teachings now, once again, after intentionally denying them access to such teachings for thousands of years). Buddhism was once a usable spiritual tod. but ma again the priestaaft perverted the Original teachings and turned them into a tad of arslaveane'it of tLe me which it pw'ports to ii- The sacxcd writings of tk natim of Islam also contains some truth, but an oppressive and lacking compassion in their strict observance Thus it follows that any 'New Agew sou^ which use or reference hse major digiaas of the wodd must be looked at with great mewation and careful study. It is intensting to note that of the information in the \"New Agew movement regarding alien Species, organizations and civilizations, the great majaity of thesc supposedly advanced alien civilizations an canrrolled by sodalist. military, rights-oppnsrive types of governments, similar to the Nazi regime. which, in fa% wdy punish thcir citizens for even light mideeds. One would think that civilizations advanced enough to belong to galactic federations and travel to distant wdds would have a civilization based more on freedom of cbda, guaranteed rights and mutual wisdom, and voluntary protection for all. This docs not seem to be the case, however, and the acceptance of the sociological information dng from this aspect of the \"New Age\" movement would serve to indoctrinate foliowers into these types of social stnrchues and convince them to accept these oppressive forms of government This should be a clear warning to us to accept no hdp which would be fostered on us by any alien civilization which would suddenly dedm to be our allies, but that we should seek the continuance of growth of the republican fonns of government which have sprung up in our own history. Thc OwrVicw holds to the position that the only form of government which can guarantee the unalienable spirituai rights of all individual beings is a republican form of government, and that we should use the springboard which is the United Slotcs Constitution and the Bill Of Righu to jump farward into the future. This docs not mean that we should not negotiate in good faith with representatives of supposed alien civilizations, but that we shduld mind our own shop and be vigilant and skeptical about any amtaus which we may have. This would oaly be consisrent with the intentions of the fordathers of the Anmiwn Republic ~r. eorr~usion, mc must otwvc that a Mjaity 01 the information which mes fm the \"New Age\" movement seems to serve the purpose of socialist elements of the international intcliigcnrx elite in an attanpt move the warld towards an apocalyptic event to be the catalyst to the installation of some type of Om Worid Government which would bring on a supposed 'New Agew and New WorU Order. This seems to be consistent with the agenda of the alien miiitary- governorship custodians. As Bramley notes, IK, dogma of apocalyptic salvation which has been peddled far millennia to the people by those unwitting and witting agents of the custodians has ever manifested any supposed utopia which was prorniscd as part of that salvation.

Right of Free Idonnation. Every individual being has the right to be exposed to experiences and information which are held as common or possible by orher individual beings a by civilization. This indudes the right to all known information of a civilization. This indudes the right of individual beings to communicafe for the puqxse of the sharing of experiences and idormation.

Without that vital life fm. the physical body is inanimate, and without a functional body, the life form will not be incarnate in this material dm. When that life form is separated from a damaged a unfunctional physical body, a prrxxss of passage and transmutation occurs in which the life form, being a compilation of unique energy pattnns with a common spiritual elemental tie to all things in the Universal system, moves into the physical existential reaim of that life form Mng.

Herein at last is the Magnum Organum-not the ancient instrument of Perception or the modern organ of Knowledge, but the Perennial Wisdom newly Minted and Dispensed. What's \"new\" about the Gnosis, MT? we hear some sigh already. We've had centuries before you showed to be swarmed with tracts and treatises professing to state secrets and reveal the coded seals of ourselves some of which seemed reasonable or redolent of real insight, some less so... but in any case this prolific print-century has disgorged them all good-bad-and-indifferent onto the open market where we can plainly see the imprint of one source on another, the backmom copying and provincial borrowing once masked by mists of time and space now suddenly snapped together in bookshelf juxtaposition ... With all such scattered \"arcanum\" now gathered for our convenience on the central new age floor of comparison-shopping, the sense distilled most strongly is that of the real redundance with which these tired volumes speakde iteration in innumerable translations and redactions and meticulous incunabull of \"wisdom\" drawn hm the same few sources (whether nominally Theravada or Mahayana, the Kankda-malini-Tama or Mahaprajna-paramitopadesa) of secrets whispered, tomb-robbed and fancifully embroidered till generational erosion degrades the imprint of the original to a garbled \"Keys of Enoch\" eidolon (from which all \"Black Pullets\" and dark grimoires may be scrawled in general information-loss of the scratchy candle-lit quill, trailing mimetic marks just near-enough the aaJmddb godnames for suitable evocation of dross conceived in the very verbal abortions of the dim transcription itself). , Forgive us, then, if we're generally jej~qe with respect to the \"perennial wisdom\" all of which seems to emit the self-same reF1en:e hm the same musty sarcophagus ... and besides, so hoary an accumulation of the \"old\" (whch rmght, admittedly, have got us here) is moot in any case since modernly we're launched right into the spaceage upgrade, light years beyond what could be sifted fiom any ash of the Alexandrian library, since we're being tutored first-hand in higherdi- mensional concern by higher-dimensional beings themselves! i.e. the Space Beings, the Pleiadeans and the Arcturians and the Andromedans and the Sirians and all such transdimensional amphibians"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV as Seth and Agartha and Ramtha! So wherefore the \"perennial wisdom\", MT? What makes the Southern Crown version any different fiom the average mass of terrestrial arcana already available in copious oversupply that we should consult \"Mom Tallion\" rather than Fox, \"Ming Trey\" rather than Cayce, \"Monty Tyson\" rather than Madam Blavatsky or \"Mother Terasu\" rather than Besant (Annie) or Muldoon (Sylvan) or Bailey (Bill ...j ust-kidding). To which MT has a two-fold reply ... First of all, the smaragdine fact of Earth-history's collective arcanum evidentially converging on just a few-even overlapping--Sources so the esoteric glossolalia is gradually deciphered into a handful of familiar dialects doesn't average to a dull equivalence of the material in question. Though the point may be lost to the disinterested ear of modem hubris (happy with its \"happening\" sources of spaceage information-upgrade) the fact of a preponderant \"unoriginality \" or even average information-loss through timesands leaked down the archeological cracks doesn't rule upon the Tmth or timeless cogency of the inspiriting Source Itself; the fact of endless counterfeit and dated carbon doesn't cancel the authenticity of--or render / any less Real--the Superior character belonging to certain self-shining remnants amongst the general rubble. It merely requires contemporary initiated intelligence to sift the Superior fiom what otherwise would remain confused with the fools-gold inferior. Some of those surviving sources are sufficiently \"primary\" expressions of authentic initiated Intelligence indigenous to the tutelary Type of this planetary School, as to merit continued respect and ongoing study-4er all, that's Why it's calledthe Perennial Wisdom, because it doesn't \"date\", it doesn't fade to fashion or collapse with hat-in-hand to the first Voice issuing from an elevation literally above its own. It's the argument of Initiated Intelligence and its Perennial Wisdom, that what was valid \"then\" is valid forever. Whatever has been transmitted to the greater part of fidelity fiom those traditions into the present, is a viable Lifefonn perhaps cryogenically \"trapped\" in a preservative medium (such as Tarot, or the \"Shakespere\" plays) which while keeping the codes intact doesn't in itself advance the healing Key, but which yields to ready thawing and a disclosure of contents in the Presence of the Living Key4.e. the ever-awake Being of Initiated Adeptship able to disperse the Spell and, with a Kiss, bring Sleeping Beauty from aeonic slumber back to Consciousness again. Indeed, then, not only are such incorruptible Truths, Spiritual Premises and Principles preserved in whatever ad hoc container, and forwarded for the edification of any given \"now\"; the Living Source and Chiron-tutors of the Terrestrial dispensation having given those Teachings originally remain with us, right up to the End, perhaps a different-though sometimes, as in the present case, the self-same-Personality expression but the identical Essence nonetheless carxying forward as Office-holder in one of the three Hierarchic categories of Tikkun, or Restoration: Many Bodhisattva and Mahachohan. What's different then about some particular expression of the Wisdom Teaching is thaf while inevitably unrecognized or underappreciated as such by uninitiate humanity it issues directly fiom an authentic higher-dimensional Personality-source securing one of the Offices and Rays on behalf of an indigenous tutorial function, oriented specifically with respect to the type of School founded in the Earth-spirit. Thus if anything' certain such survivalist expressions of the Wisdom Teachings require far-deeper respect and redoubled regard than is presently accorded them; and those most awakened in spirit to the special task of faithfully reconstituting their remnant hiero- glyphs (as RA. Schwdler and Isha DeLubitz or Edward Johnson, for instance) are far more deserving of study and attention than their conventional counterparts confecting the inevitable I__C-"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"MATRIX N \"official\" truth (that buries even deeper in the desert sands whatever wisdom might accidentally be excavated). What recommends this present offering of our Magnum Organum above contemporary \"expositions\" of the ancient arcana (or even modem revisionism inspired by spacebeing broadcast) is the self-same factor recommending those particular, presened expressions of the Wisdom Teaching discerned above the Matrix of hodgepodge material in which they're inevitably embedded. Though you may have read much purporting to convey or interpret our wisdom, you haven't yet read the Word of the Mahachohan. It's only now, and Here with this wedge of Light slipped between and sandwiched in the general Choronzonclamor of this world that you may do so. Wait! Wait, MT, hold on a minute! we hear from Those ever-vigilant to the hoodwinking enterprise of the mystic-mongering mc!mkbdc or sleightofhand charlatan (always known to accompany these road-show carnivals and Midwest midway-attractions only to litter the lineups later under positive-identification of the m..). What can anyone make of such a claim, when the whole category \"Mahachohan\" while sounding impressive-enough in the rural regions doesn't really correspond to anything..fmiZiar? For all we know it's like claiming you're the \"Rajafalafel of Rajistan\"; sounds fhe, and with a few epaulets and tassels sewn back on your highschool-band uniform we're sure you'd cut a convincing figure-but who 'd know dzflerently? Who was the last \"Rajafalafel of Rajistan\" to come through these parts? and how do we know your predecessor carried proper credentials while he was here? Aside from a few very general words about the Mahachohan in the Bailey material (and the probable willingness of a multitude of theosophists to dispute this present claim), nothing really arises to succinctly characterize what the Mahachohan is nor should be, or how to distinguish him from any Mahatma-Khan-Jeeves or random marich meandering down the street any given day... We arrive now at the second phase of MT's reply. Just as we've asked what ought to recommend this current material above extant offerings, we answer with the same response suited to the dilemma as to how the \"Mahachohan\" may be identified: read the materials contained herein. Nothing substitutes for personal discrimination, the cultivated exercise of intelligence and intuitive sensitivity. The means both of identifying the quality of the material and the presence of the Mahachohan rests as always with that inbuilt potential possessed through faculties of everyone born to the Mother. The Mahachohan, like his Manu/Bodhisattva counterparts, always sheds clues as naturally as the molting of a snake concerning the authenticity of his presence, wherever he appears; but as much as these clues are assuredly present, by that much is it the sure responsibility of each to awaken some part of the uncommon faculty within himself in order to identify that this is true. Only inauthentic beings look for, and give, conventionally unambiguous \"signs\" or standard traits easily crosschecked against a list (recall when \"christians\" silently dropped the convention of scanning for \"Christ's return\" according to the giveaway sandals and Scheherazade- locks, when the hippies appeared ...) By way of example ... in answer to the (largely unasked) question as to why a \"christ\" or \"buddha'' or bbzoroaster\" or \"la0 tze\" isn't unanimously recognized and overwhelmingly greeted by the multitude at the time of his appearance: it is neither the business or obligation of the authentic adept, master or avataric being to manifest as other than the Manifestable to begin with. There are no \"multitudes\"; there's only you. The collectivity doesn't live you and die you. The multitude doesn't rule upon the great spiritual decisions of your life. Therefore' such Presence is always a Test, not the doorprize in a giveaway show."},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV One needn't be \"learned\" to identify such a presence; neither however is illiteracy, epilepsy, wealth, poverty or moronism a prerequisite. There is a sign, a legitimate way to know, and to be sure; and the true spiritual master is never willfully parsimonious about the bestowal of such sign. But the religious expectation, the anticipated or officially-approved sign is not the sign. Each such legitimate sign is an awakening of the authentic Personj-om the multitude, not through cliches of the multitude's requirements. Nor does this make such sign merely \"self determined\" or subjective or the private ego-identification whereby \"my truth isn't the same as your truth, but I honor your beingness blah blah blah ...\" The sign always has the power of a real event (which as we know, when we're not distractedly infatuated with or hypnotically enthralled by the dreamdrone \"You Create Your Own Reality\", instantly disperses the subjective integrity of our mind-held preferences and preoccupations). Yet its power as a real event is peculiarly dependent on thepersonality 's power to admit it into his world for what it is, just as the Aztecs couldn't at first see the Spanish ships though they were just offshore. Though the term \"humility\" is the least fashionable of any human term, nonetheless the first-line gift for the kind of insight able to deliver such accurate Recognition depends-more than anyone would like to concede-upon that Grace of the truly humble who without self-sening show may make a deep self-admission down past jealousy or rage, envy or resentment at the perceived power of the Master to Show as none other can Show, and Tell as none-other can Tell. For, after all, in this mudhut schoolhouse of Earthburg, Show-and-Tell is the deepest game that can be played, for which the \"Confessional\" of the catholic cloister is the nearest religiously-mangled approximation. This then is the significance of \"confession\", and the true sense of that \"humility\" about which the reader doubtless thought he'd never again have to hear (having struck out on the road of spiritual independence fiom childhood churchliness and subsequently found so contrastive a counsel in \"adult\" spiritual fare as the Matrix Home Companion he's holding now). This is the sought-for face of the \"humble\" (as opposed to the thousand-and-one Eddie-Haskell counterfeits dramatized daily in the theatrical sandlot of this place). Confession to some Cloth, so peculiar a ritual abreaction when its origin and real function are long lost, only acts as socially-cementing substitute for that real inner confession the ruling priority of which isn't to be stated but to be inwardly honored and lived; such confession can only proceed fiom real humility, since only the authentically humble can inwardly bow in ego-solvent recognition of what's precedent to (i.e. \"in advance of ', \"beyond\" or \"above\") itself. This alone \"demonstrates\" an ample Grace: that which bows to the side in sure intuitive knowledge and subjective certainty, ceding Place-of-Honor in the soul's preferred seating-arrange- ments to what humility alone may recognize has come as the Superior Part to Instruct the 3rd stage Confession, so as to uplift and Relieve it at last. Otherwise, what's there as the avatar of false humility is the standard ego-ploy of \"something for nothingw-geigning confession while secretly hallucinating how it strokes an \"ego\" similar to itself for the benefits it may charm-loose and lasso to private aggrandizement. What's there, is resentment at something the soul already confesses despite conscious reluctance (as if the \"soul\" were suddenly given to cuckolding the phallic sovereignty of \"I\") so that, caught on the horns of this inward betrayal the ego resents and objects all the more, and in the guise of one receiving \"instruction\" progressively demands that more-and-more be given for less-and-less attention in just the proportions, quantities and containers specified."},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The above depicts fairly gracefully the jaundiced attitude of the regular seeker, seeking really to be the Avatar and sole sovereign recipient of the Universe 's adoring Attention. Ingress to the characteristic Confessional obliged upon adepts, masters and avatars of this domain on the other hand, may be located in the kind of humility alluded to by Meher Baba when making his admission-to-the-world as to his authentic avatarship. This sort of humbleness is not understandable at all to those for whom \"confession\" of avatarship automatically, inevitably and necessarily signals ego-aggrandizement-this, of course, owing to the fact that in the projective case of themselves such confession could only be ego-aggrandizement. But for the authentic spiritual master any such pronouncement comes as a real admission, a confession in truth owing precisely to the most intimate understanding of how Impossible such a Position (state or condition) actually is, not only with respect to the cment level of mankind's comprehension or according to the red magnitude of the \"difficulty\" involved, but simply as a measure of the Chasm between finite knowing and Infinite apprehension, suspended in the Samadhi of Confession but materially present in and along-with every gesture the avatar otherwise makes, being an inexpugnable aspect of the Whole right with everything else. It's for this reason and no other an adept or avatar (of one-or-another theosophical Office) \"doesn't mind\" making the confession of his or her uncommon Presence in the world-under- standing the above, there is no question of \"ego\" lingering in any such confession at all. Yet this is something which must be Seen, inwardly determined by the potential spiritual aspirant to the degree the Great inner Organ of Knowing may be consulted at its current level of fiee Admission. This may be an unwelcome word to many readers (you might be surprised, indeed, as to which readers)--but it's simply so. The Universe won't change itself because someone objects to the requirements. Alright, MT, we hear the reader readily consent to his own impeccable humility, there are things the seeker must do, and developments he must endure; that's fair enough. But, though there's no convenient sign or standardized template in the sense of some automatic comparator with which to evaluate the nominee to Teacherhood (and thus avoid any personal work) surely it isn't too demanding to ask at least for bearings in this bewildering sea? Surely it's not beyond the bounds of propriety at least to ask the MT Who the last manifestation of the Mahachohan might have been? (since, meanin' no disrespect yer honer but, well, this business of the \"Mahachohan\" just doesn't choke folks up right away with the kind of instant recognition you might get when speaking of say, buddhahood or christhood, y'know. ''Mahachohan\" just doesn't automatically drum up a lot of vivid images or strong associations, unless it's that of a triple-whirl dairyqueen ...y 'mind just givin' us country-follcs a \"fer-instance\"? All right. The last manifestation of the Mahachohan appeared in Elizabethan times, as... Francis Bacon. \"Who?\" half the readership asks automatically, while the other half, in Oliver Hardy counterpart, lifts one brow of bright recognition while a shadow of perplexity crosses the countenance at the same time. Wait a second, this second half says, how can the Lord Chancellor of England qualify for some spiritual Office when he's most noted, aside fiom bribery charges, as co-author of the scientific ethos along with Descartes? Though many are willing to concede that, as the Britannica proclaims, he was the greatest mind of the Renaissance. that's hardly the same as being a great spiritual Light-indeed just the opposite, as half the new age architects are willing to attest--e.g. Theodore Rojack in particular takes exception to Bacon as being, perhaps, the most"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"w\" influence amongst all the acknowledged renaissance luminaries. How does one reconcile the apparent concerted materialism and rational skepticism of Francis Bacon with the idea he's Mahuchohan and thus a manifestation of one of the three spiritual Offices of theosophy? Here 's how, MT rejoins with the case for the defense: what's conventionally \"known\" about Bacon is hardly all there is to know about him. However, what's not academically sanctified isn't banished thereby to inaccessible regions; a tradition persists in the Mystery School arcanum to the effect that Bacon, like several other court luminaries of the time such as John Dee, led (at least) a double life. Whereas Dee was not only Elizabeth's court astrologer and conduit of the Enochian Tablets (along with Edward Kelly) but a spy for the crown in foreign realms and the original 007, Bacon was the pivotal hierophant single-handedly responsible for consolidating the fragments of initiatory societies throughout Ewope and renewing the Mystery Tradition altogether for the coming age; he was, as Manley Palmer Hall reiterates in his Secret Teachings OfAII Ages, the on@ Rosicrucian or Christian Rozencranz himself, through whom the symbolisms and initiatory practices of the secret societies streamed forward refieshed in the forms of spiritual Masonry, various Rose-cross Orders and more generally the Qabalisms that appeared in specialty through distinguished outcroppings of Flammel, Maier, Fludd, Ashmole etc. Therefore all such societies to the present day regardless the alleged or real corruptions they've undergone or the syncretisms by which they're subsequently characterized, owe their being in substantial part to the private studies, the hidden practices and secret 1ucubratioIq of the Lord Chancellor. How does all this square with the apparently antithetical character of his Novum Organum, Great Instauration etc.? wherein the crown's chief lawyer set forth all the essential precepts for what has become by hindsight the \"self-alienating\" modes of cognitive objectification and reductive analysis etc.? In answer, we must assume an uncommon or esoteric overview. We must understand the renaissance for what it was, and what it meant in larger spiritual terms as an expression of a particular cross-roads juncture in Earth-conscious development. We may say that, by Overview, it was the determined \"commission\" of the Spiritual Hierarchy (\"Great White Brotherhood\" etc.) which oversees mankind's spiritual progress to greater or lesser effect, to foment the European Renaissance--in conjunction with a general counterpart revival of Qabalism spearheaded by Moses Cordovera and Isaac Luria in Safed, Galilee--as an acute counterbalance of personal investigatiodinsight unfettered by authoritarian religious sanction in reaction to the receding Middle Ages. At the same time, the Brotherhood was not uncognizant of the kinds of purely \"materialist\" focus and analytic concentration such emphasis would engender; as with every great Spiritual Move, the inevitable \"negative\" side-effects were calculated into the overall account as a kind of advised \"risk\" presumably subsumed to the larger Aim of quickening the comptive and dis-integrating influences coded in any case into the last cyclic Stage of the Kdi Yuga (the final and most negative of the four great spiritual cycles) so as to hasten the general conscious-alchemical process of Solve. The stage of Solve, (decay, comption, entering-into-solu- tion) is, in alchemy, the prerequisite condition for recombining the dissociated elements into new and higher syntheses; as with all things of which consciousness is the standard, the forms into which patterns become crystallized giving the contextual limit of their elemental interactions must undergo a transmutative process much like \"deathw--the known/comfortable identity-types must dissolve, having become progressively c&s-nctional owing to their rigidity in a changing context, in order for their constituents to be freed thus contributing to more supple integrations and versatile/unitive alignments with the ample totality."},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The thrust of the Brotherhood was therefore two-fold; on the one hand it would strike a blow to fiee consciousness-in-general from corrupt misapplication of the deductive mode and the a priori; on the other it would assay to incorporate the resultant imbalances tilted to the opposite (inductive/aposteriori) side, so as to accelerate the coming disintegrative force of the final phase of the Kali Yuga (through which we're now collectively passing); the rationale for this is the same Biblically memorialized in the saying that, unless those \"last days\" were shortened, none would survive their corruptive power (i.e. the longer the actual timespan allotted negative influence or the slower, more leisure& its stretched-out distribution of effect over the given allotment of time, the more thoroughly would consciousness be subjected to its power and thus the more fatally saturated in its quality, so that nothing might recover fiom so complete an exposure). Therefore the Brotherhood sent its Mahachohan to produce this two-fold effect in the world, at the critical juncture of the Renaissance. What we \"see\" of Bacon officially, is not as a consequence all there is to see. If we could understand that what we see of him in Novum Organum is but a facet of his overall work and being (and that, not necessarily appreciated or understood for what it is regardless the admitted scope of its influence) and, that there are other equally-as-powerful and fateful influences flowing directly from his presence not conventionally ascribed to him or associated with him, we might come more easily to see how Bacon fulfills the truly spirirual dimension indispensable to any characterization of the \"Mahachohan\". What if this allegedly \"objective\", detached proto-scientific type were juxtaposed against the universally acknowledged heart and monumental humanity of a \"William Shakespeare\"? and what if in this juxtaposition we suddenly see, as by a miracle, the \"Wo\" countenances blend unmistakably into one (just as the famous Droushout portrait of \"Shakespeare\" dissolves mmktakably into the template of the Baconian bust when superimposed--see graphic evidence in Hall's Secret Teachings etc.). What? Come now, MT, you're not fhg back on that hoary old argument of the \"Baconians\", long disproved and passed-on by scholars everywhere? Why yes, as a matter of fact MTYs doing just that; indeed he's calling succinctly for a rep~blic~on of all pertinent (and largely out-of-print) volumes pertaining to the Baconiadstratfordian logoma&, just as folks have currently been calling for a reopening or public disclosure of the ~ongressional archives in the case of the Kennedy assassination. Even more emphatically than the Warren Commission failed to \"prove\" its lone-gunman thesis, so the Stratfordians, it will be found in any fair review of the respective documents, never came close to disproving the Baconian thesis-on the other hand, the Baconians and in particular through the prolific work of Edward Johnson have definitively proven already beyond the shadow of any reasonable or unreasonable doubt, not only that the actor \"Shakespere\" could never have written the plays but that Bacon necessarily had to, and moreover left ample encrypted evidence to prove it! All the S*a@ordians ever did, is selectively nibble at \"weaker\" points of the con argument re Shakespeare, and never substantially addressed, attacked or disproved the self-evident Baconian ciphers found all over the \"Shakespere\" manuscripts except to resort to ludicrous ad hominem arguments which are the substantial source of all present misperceptions about Bacon himself (i.e. it's thanks to this hack-job of \"debunking\" that history carries the general impression even in its encyclopedias that Bacon \"favored the method of torture\" for extracting political information, or that his prosecution for \"bribery\" was anything more than a political sacrifice of the well-known variety so that James could protect his \"favorite\", Bucking- ham.. .)"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"MATRIX N Think not? Though this isn't the place to go into an extensive examination of the subject, we may certainly give brief exarnple-keeping in mind these examples are hardly exhaustive nor necessarily the best to be found but merely typical of a fulminating Mega-Ton of unimpeachable evidence (this subject is treated much more extensively in The Mother Book, however, wherein another and even greater Element of conoborative evidence is introduced which in effect brings the whole Law Book to bear on deciding the case for the defense). Here we may suffice with one or two examples from Johnson's classic casebook, and a frslgment of an example fiom MT given larger exposition in The Mother Book For instance' then, Johnson has us note that in Act I, Scene 2 of The Tempest we have a typical Baconian acrostic concealing the real identity of the playwright for future generations ostensibly capable of perceiving the greater picture: \"Begun to tell me what I am, but stoptlAnd left me to a bootelesse InquisitionJC~ncluding~ stay: not yet.\" Not only do the first letters of the first and second lines wed to the last three letters of the third render BACon, but such a cipher is typical of known ciphers in Bacon's acknowledged works. Again, Bacon's initiatic number by simple English \"qabala\" (explained in extenso in The Mother Book) was 33 (thus the 33rd degree of Freemasonry). On one folio page of King Henry the Fourth Parr One, the name \"Francis\" or \"Fran\" appears exactly 33 times. As Manley Hall points out, \"to attain this end, obvious awkward sentences were required, as: 'Anon, Francis? No, Francis, but tomorrow Francis: or Francis, on Thursday: or indeed Francis when thou wilt. But Francis.\"' From the memory-files of MT, we have the interesting example of \"Shakespeare's\" most familiar appellation, of syllables so warmly 1-d reassuring to Stratfordians everywhere: \"The Bard of Avon\". This endearing \"title\" was bestowed upon the false-fionting actorljoint-owner of Stratford-on-Avon by his ostensible \"good fiiend\", Ben Jonson. Now it's well known that Jonson was a best fiiend of Francis Bacon. Extensive documentation testifies to this fact in the form of diaries and notes, whereas Jonson's \"great fiendship\" with Shakespear is evidentially confined to a few brief Jonsonian references to the \"bard\" not all of which are flattering in the least and some of which are only interpretable as ouhight ridicule (a fact the Stratfordiaas duly ignore; just as they ignore the fact that, though Jonson was ostensibly a mutual fiend of both Bacon and the actor Shakespere there is not one mention in all of Bacon's voluminous writings re \"Shakespere\", or \"Shakespear\", or \"Shakespeare\" etc. For the ''two\" greatest literary lights of the age sharing a mutualfiiend between them not to find even the semblance of an association making its way to a single surviving page has to be one of the historical oddities of all time---um.l you realize that, given Bacon's undoubted knowledge of Hebrew Qabalism by internal evidence of his own writings, we find \"Bard of Avon\" dissolves by Baconian magick into Bard of (0=6&6:6+6=12: 1+2=3,3=Gimely in English equivalency a \"G\" or C) Avon: Ba C on. The remaining internal letters (rd-a-v) also have deep meaning discussed more fully in The Mother Book). This then gives the readership a brief depiction of a fonner manifestation of the Mahachohan (see excerpt from introduction to The Mother Book, this volume, for more on past historical expressions of the self-same single Personality of the Mahachohan, and see The Mother Book itself for an extensive examination of all these historical personalities and their hidden interrelationships as well as an exposition of a known spiritual text which proves their collective Identity through a Magickal manipulation of Time Itself).

In other words, to extract the precious essence of a real Teaching, the veritable Pearl of Great Price, requires Work, just as one must pry the lid of an oyster if one would extract its nacreous core... But wait again, MT! we hear an uncomfortable commotion from the back of the room, don't our dear fiends the \"Marciniak Pleiadeans\" tell us specifically that if something requires work it's not worth it, and we shouldn't have to apply ourselves to anything we find \"hard\"? \"If something is not being done effortlessly, then forget it. If it looks like it is too much work, something is telling you it is not the way.\" Page 122, Bringers of the Dawn. If folks can actually accept these homilies fiom the ventriloquist transmissions of perfectly unapparent entities, then such folks are welcome to them. It's a good thing however that the Marciniak Pleiadeans never counselled Jesus or Buddha, never whispered their wisdom into Einstein's or Edison's ear or told Tesla these scintillating truths-let alone coached Jim Thorpe, or trained Jake LaMotta! These are the same Pleiadeam who (without MT specifically in mind, of course-how could we dare presume such self-glorifying focus of celestial attention!) counsel in sober sotto voce \"We recommend that you do a little questioning of anyone who overdefines and tells you absolutes\". Well, we recommend you question any ostensibly celestial or \"higher-dimensional\" source which has no account of \"absolute\" in its highflying corpus at all, for which in fact \"absolute\" is such anathema; for these are those same who absolutize relativism infefentially in the same manner as Bashar, and to the same self-contradictory effect (see Bash book review, this volume). These are those for whom \"overdefinition\" apparently has some meaning, whereas \"absolute\" apparently has none. (This does not, however, prevent them from pontificating at one point: \"You have come here to hold new fkquencies being beamed to you fiom space ... As you begin to know that this is your purpose, you will begin to design your purpose consciously ... This is an absolute.\" Page 1 14, op. cit. No. This is precisely what's not an absolute. This is a very specific and tendentious mandate of a contingent type fiom an interestingly manipulative source.) Yet every significant Teaching of atruly higher Order or density-degree above 3rdpivots its philosophy around a deep and necesstny understanding--even practical apprehension--of Absolute. This is aprerequisite of authentic initiated insight; whereas \"overdefining\" is a relative concept that depends on subjective tolerance levels for its \"cut-off\" point, and apparently pivots on the standard of laziness (excuse me, \"effortlessness\") dear to the Pleiadeans themselves-who, instead, offer us not \"definitions\" but rather, \"stories\": \"We like to pride ourselves on being storytellers. There is a certain credibility and a certain sensationalism in the way we present data. However, a story that we tell you at one point is certainly not the only story; it is not the end, and it is never the only truth. It is only one fragmentation, one small portion of the bigger picture. 7 \"No matter what story we tell you today, we guarantee that a year from now we will tell you a different story, because a year fiom now you will be able to comprehend things in a grander fashion.\" Page 10, op. cit. Rather, then, than committing to the precise definition offirst principles which ought to be the primary and overriding concern of any spiritual teaching or metaphysical philosophy at all, the Pleiadeans prefer to shadowdance us along with admittedly shifting \"stories\". This is certainly in keeping with their intransigent relativism; for first principles properly defined ought to be universally applicable under any situation, a permanent attribute of the soul's essential armamen- tarium, whereas tales of our \"extra-planetary\" origin etc. are self-evidently contingent, depend on"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV one's personal ingenuous subscription or unconfirmed belief taking the \"source\" of such narrative at its word as innately \"honest\", and without ulterior design. Clearly defined first principles introducing the soul to the ontological depths of itself can be applied; tales as to our ostensible \"celestial parentage\" can 't be applied, but merely believed, leading nonetheless to actions on the basis of such belief which haven't benefit of reliance on anything more substantial than the initial motivating hearsay. Yet, this seems to be exactly how the \"Pleiadeans\" want it. However, owing to their \"confession\" as shapeshifting storytellers we shouldn't expect any more consistency or wry-through logic on their part; thus when they chide us, on the one hand (with an \"eye\" this way? or are such speculations just more self-importance with no basis in fact?) to \"Look at the New Age. Do you see how the New Age is separated? All kinds of things are said to keep you fiom discovering what you have in common\" (p. 91, op. cit.), they counsel us on the other \"You must become much more discerning about what and who is corning hm the skies, because you are going to be duped and tricked and you're not going to understand it.\" (!) (p. 127, op. cit.) Any reasonable soul would of course ask how we're supposed to be so discerning, and at the same time honor some ideal of non-separate \"camaraderie\" in the New Age when those with whom the Pleiadeans are counseling us to have such camaraderie are often channelers and spokespersons for just those tricky sources they'd warn us against! Apparently the Pleiadeans (or at least the Marciniak mannequin through which they speak) are unable to resolve such contradic- tions, since, as token toward that comradeship the jacket of Bringers quotes glowing words-in-re- view fiom Darryl Anka \"channel for 'Bashar'\" while \"Bashar\", as it should be clear to all-at least after reading the Bashar Book Review this volume--is precisely the type of b%icky being\" who tells you \"you create your own reality\" so as to lure you into acceptance of spacealien abduction! Ostensibly the Pleiadeans wouldn't want the readership to get the impression \"Bashar\" is \"just okay\" with them though \"he\" appears by endorsement on their dust jacke t... would they? Or is it just that they share an endearing trait in commonality with 3rd-stage humankind, and will wantonly quote anyone or anything at all having a kind word for them despite what they otherwise know about said source? In any case, the reader should understand right here, before Entering the Sanctum Sanctorum at all, that by studying very precisely definedfirst principles he will come to activate and unfold precisely those universal truths to which they correspond; whereas by heeding self-ad- mitted stories spun by invisible Sky-narration he can only lurch blindly along by the nosering wherever the \"stories\" lead. And let's look more closely at the nature of those stories: while they may seem to be more \"entertaining\" than the dry definitions of dehydrated spiritual concepts, at least with a little \"water\" (your transformed hormonal chemistries) such definitions may be re-hydrated and expand to Life within your own being-whereas with the \"entertainment\" you can only continue switching dials in channel-surfing comparison fiom one to another source purporting to \"explain\" how you got here, or to account for the circumstances in which you currently exist. Thus you may accept hearsay of the \"Pleiadeans\" that the invisible barrier of the planetary energy-net is a masking screen originally thrown 'round the planet to \"keep you here\", by the negative reptilian-types; when this business of the enveloping energy-grid sounds vaguely familiar and you turn to a source such as Ra wherein you recall having heard something parallel, you're faced with the conundrum of \"choosing\" between diametrically opposed explanations-for the Ra material insists this same energy-screen"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV was installed by the Positive Hierarchy to impartially preserve the Earth-sphere fiom undue intuence impinging from without. Now, you can ''take a stance\" and decide on the basis of nothing-much just which source is \"telling the truth\" (and thus, which source is idkentially the \"good guy\"). But this has nothing whatever to do with spiritual development. It's cowboys-and-Indians, or choosing sides in a televised football game. Indeed before believing any such \"choice\" you might make is necessarily that between the truth-tellers and liars, you'd best consider this SC counsel: the disparity of \"stories\" hm separate sources pointing to the same general thing or phenomenon, isn't necessarily an effect of relative veracity. Both stories may be \"true\" in their contexts! For the context is, that each such storytelling source approaches fiom Elsewhere at an oblique angle; this \"angle\" isn't just spatially oblique--it's composed rather ofprobability components. Each source approaches fiom a slightly variable-or greatly variable-probabilitycurrent. From the perspective of any given outside source, \"we\" may have \"gotten here\" (and presently inhabit n circumstances) according to the specifc probabilityfield by which that source is remotely connected to us. Thus while each may \"perceive\" the same basic condition or \"fact\" as the other (e.g. the enveloping Earth energy-net) they may perceive its origin, purpose and significance quite differently depending on the luminous probability-stream down which they respectively sight Edgar Cayce saw the \"destruction of Atlantis\" as self-induced; the Andromedans as reported in Col. Stevens' book on same, attribute the destruction of Atlantis to a hostile ray from the planet Marduk. Both perceive the bare \"event\", the \"destruction of Atlantis\". Yet each perceives and thus interprets from a variant spiritual-cosmic \"perspective\". That perspective has to do with the varying densitydegree of the given sources, the relative position both in timespace and spacetime mediated by each etc. This effect can be understood on the basis offirstprinciples, in this way. Just as there are emphatic astrological configurations (conjunctions, T-squares, trines) set by the tirnedhded cycles and internal coordinates of things to occur so there's no real chance they won 't occur, yet these significant coordinate \"nodes\" aren't strictly determined in the same way beforehand re specifics of the events they foreshadow. The events themselves must come to pass according to the type and quality of configuration; but the determinative content surrounding, feeding into and concretely constituting those events are variable just as the exact meaning of Jupiter-square-Neptune may discharge in several probable ways and only arises as a specific complex of factors in the relative context \"I\" experience. In the same way the \"sinking of Atlantis\" or the \"Earth energy-screen\" may be considered a \"necessary scheduled event\"; but a number of probable outriders issue fiom the raw potential of any such event. Those probabilities will \"materialize\" in their own separate contexts according to the coordinative streams that connect the percipient to the event. Thus in one context the spiritual learning requirement signified by the scheduled presence of an \"Earth energy-screen\" may come about as the apparent result of spiritual determinations issuing from a positive \"Confederacy\"; in another context, according to the luminous self-linkups of probability networks the requirement might be fulfilled through nefarious designs of some Negative machination. In either case the \"requirement\" is fulfilled, yet each probable event carries its own stress, implications, net of consequences and probable-projections in turn. Thus the \"acceptance\" of any given \"story\" of any given source as of primary importance regarding \"your\" origins, the facts and meanings of \"your\" present condition etc. isn 't innocuour.

And from what probability-perspective do the \"Pleiadeans\" weave their enrapturing stories for Earth-edification? Why, those who counsel us as to the negatively-designed presence of the Earth energy-net come from a self-admitted future probability where the evil Reptilians have taken over the planet entirely, and the whole rest of the known universe on top of it! This is the \"reality\" to which they'd have you assuredly linked so as to throw your energy in as aggregate support, at the critical juncture of 4th density Earth transition echoing-forward innumerable potent probability streams.

You're not obliged to \"choose histories\", or accept stories, indeed you should not, for all that is a distraction to spiritual development. If indeed you \"create your own reality\", ask the Pleiadeans how such philosophy seems to have landed them in the negative mess they describe which is manifestly not to their liking, and for the repair of which they're specifically here at our doorstep at this Time? Yet \"enough of Because\". BAShR (i.e. \"Bashar\") in Hebrew, my dearthelemites, means \"because\". In the time-honored tradition (especially at those junctures of spiritual renewal and the founding of New Dispensations) we employ Prophetic Criticism of the prevailing World-view as inspirational point-of-departure whereby to introduce the Major Positive Key of the Spiritual Philosophy itself. Since we're at a uniquely critical juncture of historical \"time\" where there's really no prevailing Worldview or unified philosophical outlook other than \"me-ism\", we bring Prophetic Criticism to bear upon an Incoming Philosophy which presently is in the gesture of attempting to install itself as the new regnant Worldview, i.e. \"You Create Your Own Reality\". We insist this is \\ not the right philosophy, and isn't really a \"teaching\" at all but is rather the tendentious ploy of a certain heterogenous aggregate of extradimensional sources from the same general level and \"family background\" yet prosecuting the identical Sky-slogan each for its own separate-and-unequal I / purposes. Thus we open our Magnum Organum--after a Word On The Mother Book-with practical instruction in Charger Breathing so as to fortify the soul and strengthen the body-mind in the most immediate, tangible and practical way, in anticipation of that necessary Opening of the Inner Eye and Intuitive faculty partially induced by the dialectic essays themselves but in any case ultimately required so as to click in optimum manner with the Superior Cogency of the Mother's Spiritual Dispensation.

Each such name (Mora Tallion, Monty Tyson, Mick Trumpet etc.) is \"Michael Topper\" under yet another occult butterfly costume, the moniker-markings of which may provide moments of diversion and amusement to the readership in their own right since each enshrines a \"formula\" pertinent either to the particular article or the class of article. Thus \"Mora Tallion\", when deciphered using a substantial-enough English dictionary, resolves itself into two basic terms: \"crown\" and \"balancelrevenge\". As the MT persona presenting the Charger Breathing articles, the name suggests the bringing of Baiance back to the Crown (mwnchakra, Sahasrara) under the general Aeonic formula of Horn (in Egyptian myth, Lord of the Double Horizon [balance] said to restore Order in revenging Osiris' death against Set). Thus all such butterfly costumes of \"Michael Topper\" serve to reveal some aspect of the Dispensation brought forward by Southern CrowdAAA and the Mother-current, while at the same time serving to divert attention from the fact that \"Michael Topper\" is the dream of the Butterfly whose costumes have been borrowed.

Though the ordinary ego of this plane is loath to admit the possibility of such a thing where it exists contemporaneously (as opposed to some dead past safely interpretable to the ego's proportions and dimensions), inferential evidence of the truth of that extraordinary relationship has accompanied us especially over this past year's framework, and thanks most especially to unlikely agency of exactly those who've made a virtual profession of \"predictions\" and prognostications re Earthquakes, weather-patterns and other in the worldly range of upheavals. For a long while now, it's been explained through the T-Bird medium how the Mother and her male counterpart the Mahachohan have (quite in keeping with the Alice Bailey theosophical word on the subject) helped maintain the tenuous telluric and tectonic balance, even or most especially against \"unnatural\" technological interlopers on-and-off planet (see \"Were Those Quakes Fakes?\" and the \"Global Energy-Grid\" etc.).

The truth, which every aspirant ought to know in advance, is that one is relatively \"protected\" from direct interference of the Negative in only two instances: the first is where one functions at so low a level as to be effectually \"programmed\" to bovine compliance of the larger culture, in which case one has the kind of \"protections\" afforded any cattle; one is minimally sheltered, fed and cared-for until such time as one is called to the abattoir. The second kind of \"protection\" is of the \"Dion Fortune\" occult-shield variety; this is the standard surround-yourself-with- whitelight adjuration appropriated by contemporary new age doyens as if they'd just invented it.

Where mastery and spiritual development have truly proceeded beyond the threshold at which one remains merely innocuous to the Negative design, one poses to the contrary a continuing threat to negative existence (whether with keenawareness ofthat fa% or no).

The Creator is, as well, in the midst of Its own progressive Meta-cosmic \"Waking Up\" to the real dimensions, tern and stakes of this creative strife (see the Bailey material re positive and negative hierarchies, the developmental Status of the Solar systemic and Cosmic Logoi etc.; see also the Four Winds books, which, while a channeled source drawn through strictly unawake agency of the channeler, represents a relatively undistorted report from the level of Creator-being owing to the particular channeler's \"angelic\" background making her more constitutionally \"attuned\" to the Creator-level as a vibration, though really unreceptive as any such \"angelic\" source to the Spirit of Its content or to the Earth-level vibration of the Mother [to which said Creator source offers a kind of apologetic Explanation].) No Two Ways About It Nor does this howledge ally us with an unwanted metaphysical dualism inferentially assigning equal value, status and power to a Negative agency so that Existence itseif drifts apart at the seams. The whole meta-cosmic War, if you will, has to do (as thoroughly explained in Magnum Organum) with the Creative interpretation of the nondual Absolute-value from which everything, including Creator-cons~iousness~primordially issues. How that nondual Value is interpreted, what is \"included\" or \"excluded\" in its potential or actual Presence, constitutes the'respective orienta- tions of LogodAnti-Logos and gives the perpetual/'nexpugnable appearance of warring duality from the strictly created viewpoint alone. However the hallmark of true Spiritual Mastery is its *What about \"loving\" the negative rather than conceiving the relationship as a \"battle\"? See \"Channeling, UFOs ... erc.\" under Love Was AII He Suid Even the Ra material, while following the standard \"angelic\" line on the subject, is here uncharaaeristically rentative in recommendation; with reason, since all those with sufficient experience know perfectly well the polmued negative is immune, and indeed may use such strategically directed \"love\" to manipulate and entrap the \"sender\". Owing to their repulsion (rather than receptivity) to authentic love, the Ra channeler herself tends to advocate \"loving\" the negative in the combative sense, so as to drive it off! This is the last bastion of love-directing efficacy, and clearly takes leave of the spirit so that its slim rationale collapses. And what of the \"angelic\" presences which do act as Guardii Angels? Their unreliably sporadic and special (or fmoring) appearance marks their activity as a kind ofpropaganda. Their \"protection\" is strategicaily proffered, nor to adepti or to masters but to those who may be sufficiently flattered or impressed by the favor to propagandize for the simple see-no-evil hypothesis. The \"angels\" believe they get credits m \"heaven\" for everyone enlisted to subscribing in the \"dl-positive\" hypothesis, by distortive repression of the negative and everything touched by the negative."},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV establishment at once in the uncreate-Absolute Being of pre-Logoic Infinity as well as the fields and createdfpolarized planes of being. Because the ordmry 3rd-stage (non-polarized) personality perceives the Presence and Activity of such avataric embodiment only fiom the created perspective (which perspective is thus distorted in itself insofai as it is not directly illumined by the coeternal Light of Absolute-value), it may seem to such personality that the given Master is engaged in or espousing some form of dualism. But in fact, said Master is engaged in Enacting the positive Creatorlcreative interpretation of that directly-realized (uncreate-Absolute) Value so as to draw Creative and Absolute into Resolving Logoic Parity; whereas the adepts of the negative Spiritual hierarchy are engaged in enacting the negative-Luciferian interpretation of that uncreatelAbsolute being (identified exclusively as the Void-value denominator of all causative agency) so as to sacrifice the creative to the altar of an absolute altered to the dimensions of a cosmic Ego. Nor is it the business of the ordinary personality, or the spiritual aspirant either, to be \"engaged\" in this cosmic debate in the practical manner of real occult/metaphysical combat. The ordinary personality as well as the spiritual aspirant (even \"initiated\", in that sense) cannot yet properly understand the terms, has yet to develop the extended subtle instrumentality whereby to begin properly to appreciate the terms, and indeed corresponds thus-far to an operative density-level only permitting congenital misapprehension and misapplication of the terns. Here is where the \"conventional\" angelic advice is relatively applicable still: i.e. one should- the I Ching says--rehin fiom combating evil directly and instead make steady progress in the good. Spiritual \"wars\" can't be directly fought except by the real Spiritual generals. On the positive side, there are no \"enlisted men\" in the combat battalions; they are all safe as fileclerks for the positive offices of spiritual service; on the negative side, the enlistees are conscripted to do servile combat but fiom a position of ignorance (see Pricis On The Good The Bad And The Ugly by MT, Matrir Ill) which serves to keep them as much in the dark as those \"positive\" or \"non-polarized\" souls they'd adversely influence. Quacks Crack The Quake Code, Yet Still The Quaker Gloats Thus we may return you, with a little deeper appreciation and understanding, to our observation that AAA's protracted \"illness\" during the whole of '93--and overlapping '9Awasn't really \"natural\" but the result of Negative interference (hm the highest density available to the polarization-potential of that particular, spiritual \"orientation\"). We may now add that, due to the cment success with which those agencies had nullified the Mother's physical-grounding effective- ness, it was no longer possible to say with certainty how long the projected Big One (especially for the Southern CalifomialLos Angeles Basin area) could be postponed or placated. However as the world may plainly see, all the predictions seeming so confidently to dovetail-especially-on mid-1 993, never came to pass. (As we shall learn, the Great Northridge Quake of '94 following hard on the Oct.~Nov. fires of '93 is of a wholly different nature, both in terms of cause and the predictive significance.) Neither the oniony-exhalations of a much-wilted Scallion nor the dubious manufactured \"Awareness\" of alarmist newsletters, nor even the vaunted \"100% accuracy\" evinced up to the conspicuously-failed '93 prediction by the Gulf Breeze \"AWOL\" gang predictively prolific with the planchette (as cited in Leading Edge as a probable"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"sure-thing\") have proven out--even though in the particular instance there was a virtual consensus amongst them all, interestingly enough, regarding the veritable \"inevitability\" of California's mid-to-late '93 demise. Now each and every \"expert\", especially alluded to here, will have his (or Its) reason as to why even this chorus consensus failed to materialize; indeed each may be counted to take credit nonetheless as if the Northridge temblor was just a delay on the given prediction, its magnitude diminished from the Monstro forecast thanks no doubt to this very time-displacement ingratiatingly credited to the general elevation of consciousness in the meanwhile mitigating overall prime on the kannic charge etc. etc. Few will understand how all such rationalizations after-the-% especially those most servilely flattering toward \"your\" elevated role in the ultimate dislocation, are track-covering doublebacks hastily extemporized in a fog of bewilderment as to why the \"insider-tips\" didn't prove out. Those who recall the last T-Bird editorial may, on the other hand, remember MT's emphatic insistence that any quakes in that general timezone weren't matters for prediction but phenomena of manipulation, engineered by scalar techuologies of the planetary \"shadow government\" oppor- tunizing on optimum conditions in that range and amplified in probable efficacy owing to the damage meanwhile inflicted on the me mitigating influences of Adepti Presence, most particularly that of AAA herself. The dzyerence in interpretation is critical. It takes the whole matter of such \"quakes\" and \"natural\" catastrophes out of the realm of authentic prediction (in the earlier Cayce manner) and places it rather on the metaphysical battlefield. Given over to such a Variable, authoritative \"predictions\" as to when the venerable Big One will occur can 't be based on subtle input from a causally-integrated confluence of strictly telluric factors, nor can they boast privileged eavesdrop ping on \"God's domain\"; they can't claim concourse with the spirits, counsel by devas or the susurrations of elementals setting up the several subterraneous \"charges\". Such \"predictions\" may, however, reference themselves more forthrightly toward those perfectly governmental activities of the Geologic Survey in the '93 midmonths, placing their own \"experimental\" charges at strategic points in the faultline (all, interestingly, triangulating the L.A. Basin) under shallow pretext of exploding innocuous simulations so as to upgrade tectonic \"data\". Such \"predictions\" can be regarded in the same manner as \"predictions\" made at the parimutuel based on bookie handicapping. When the nag astoundingly fails to come in according to expectation, the curious pronouncement subsequently issues--as it did fiom the Geologic Survey-how all the old handicapping should be sharply reassessed; apropos of apparently nothing but some meager meaningless needlemarks flashed to the latenight newsaudience, the audacious declaration is immediately broadcast how the \"imminent\" Big One is probably no such thing and may not occur for centuries (!) All manner of scalar and subterranean nuclear jiggling having failed to nudge the plates in place for proper triggering at the appropriate NWO time, plain daylight detonations even publicly announced were straightway activated in exasperated last-ditch effort to get the action underway, like climbing out and pushing one's car to the crest of the hill when the engine's stalled, the tow-truck breaks down and no other cars are in sight. Finally, obtaining no substantial response, the Owner of the jalopy pronounces upon its utter uselessness, its further irrelevance as a reliable factor for getting the Owner where he wants to go; upon making the peremptory Declaration the Owner walks away, somewhat dispmtled but satisfied no further ministrations to the stalled vehicle (for whatever reason) will ever work. Not a moment after walking away fiom such definitive dismissal, the car surges to the crest and then rolls downhill on its own-precisely as happened with the January 17th quake, the"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV resultant relaxation of engineered manipulations through world ley-lines and the global energy-grid having lifted the anesthetization of Gaia sufficiently (her natural activity being artificially tranquil- ized, as reported through \"anonymous\" interview in Matrix III, so she might be triggered only at the pleasure of their NWO timetables) to allow her backlog of repressed potentials release on its own in precise heavenly timing, exactly in concert with the most powerful planetary conjunction in several hundred years. Thus the rumbling \"vehicle\" slid precipitously \"downhiil\" under its own momentum, an event which might not seem eflecrually different fiom the type deliberately attempted by artificial engineering-except it makes all the difference in the world. The kinds of cataclysmic mayhem \"predicted\" by the aforesaid sources and contrarily indicated by MT as a conscious effort redounding to timed benefit of the global powerstructure, pooled the distinct advantage associated with any event strategically planned. Had the effort succeeded in the months of '93, the timed triggering of the California catastrophe could be made to coincide with optimum world-government factors, which, later, would not be nearly so in \"sync\" as to enable maximal milking of One World emoluments fiom the event. In the year of the administration changeover (in truth s- the ratio of emphasis fiom Rockefeller to Rothschild power-vectors, fiom the forthrightly Fourth Reichian to the Carroll Quigley-style Catholic/Masonic contingent of the NWO consolidation) the camouflage \"chaos\" of superficial factors fomenting designed disorder 'round the wor1d-a with predictable internal problems of the theatrically dissolved Soviet bloc-could serve an \"acceptable\" implementation of widespread martial law under United Nations auspice; at the same time the \"espionage\" shadow structure in all its effective positions and proportions as prevailed under the Bush administration, would still have a hold sufficiently unifed before full turnover was underway to carry through on plans put in place and built upon all that while. Even as early as em& '94 they would not enjoy such optimum potential, and indeed things would be caught midway in an overall policy/pemnnel shift accompanied by sufficient dislocation in reworked charters and international articles as to dilute at least for the time the full power of any force or furtive agency to institute ideal agendas capitalizing on catalytic \"catastrophe\". Thus in ''frustration\" the California fires (aimed esoterically at \"Adept relocation\"!) were kindled as replacement-strategy for the failed quakes. Think not? The person held primarily \"responsible\" for setting the Calabasas fire is a man with a history of instirutiodized mental disorder--d classic profile for the programmed type usually sent to do the government's handiwork Moreover, this same man just \"coincidentally\" happens to be known, fiom childhood, by a student-initiate of Southern Crown. Although his background is clinically that of violent mental disorder, he has no history of arson; this is very unusual, since the typical pyromaniac profile is that of one obsessed from very early years with a single, and just a single, psychological abmtion. \"These Things Must Be Done .. Delicately..\" So it was that Adept-modulation of artificial shadow-government efforts frustrated all the '93 timetables, and as a consequence defeated all the sure-thing \"predictions\" of setup sources. At the same time, largely off-planet or subterraneous \"sound\" sources of negative variety were doing all they could to veto the agency of positive adeptship (strategically posted, as well, at critical positions of the global gridlines). More direct efforts at cancelling any such non-ordinary agency had to yield to the \"Ruby Slippers\" factor (discussed in various T-Bird essays) i.e. the esoteric"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV circumstance that negative sources needed topreserve certain elements belonging to said agencies relatively intact. Indiscriminate annihilation of the nonordinary agent in question (which, as we've seen, is abstractly possible despite new age inanities to the contrary) would be the occult equivalent of throwing the baby out with bath as far as such negative sources were concerned, since they necessarily benefitted hm, and needed, the very same primary-adept emplacement minimally as much as the rest of the world (unknowingly) profited hm its stabilizing Presence. Such adept-Presence functioned as a minimal rivet in a structure under intense strain; anyone having designs upon the further use of that structure altogether, whether positive or negative in orientation, necessarily relied alike on the salvatory emplacement of that integrating Bolt. Thus the \"Ruby Slipper\" effect required weakening the function of that Bolt to a critical degree so as to allow a strategically manipulative play in the structural joints, without catastrophically wrenching the rivet altogether thus rendering the structure unsuitable for any further ownership/management by anyone. (Should the reader have grasped this example, a more subtle and exacting analogy would be that of a single Stone acting as a tentpeg to hold down an entire tent; the Adversary wishes to preserve and make use of the presence of the Tent, therefore can't remove the Stone willy-nilly but must try strategically to move it around so as to slip certain debilitating things in under the tentilap thereby decimating, anesthetizing or zombifying its occupants; thus the effort is made to modulate the Position of the Stone, weaken its resistance to tent-penetration, even alter its gravity-quotient so as to introduce harmful elements over, under or around it.) Indeed the last public issue of 7NTC (Feb. '93) saw first appearance of advertisements for the long-awaited Mother Book in which all this and a universe more would be definitively discussed. Yet as was explained in that issue's Editorial and has subsequently become apparent to all those closely associated with or steadily tracking the T-Bird flightpath, Southern Crown adepts AAA and MT were under a veritable state of occult siege at the moment the announcement went to print and have remained so throughout '93, to these current few weeks of '94. Though they'd have loved to make uplifting Knowledge of the Mother and Mahachohan (of the Ray of Intelligent Activity) generally available to all there were, and are, formidable forces set sullenly against such millennial Occurrence. At the precise Moment announcing advent of The Mother Book an unprece- dented explosion of transdimensional assault through the subtle fields having multiple repercussion in the \"gross\", commenced Writing a whole new epic Chapter in the Book1argely through titanic labor of the Mother herself. Thus in the midst of disclosing that very, subtle knowledge as to how the Life of the True Mother is lived in consequential continuity with the Whole unlike that of any other (see AM, Southern Crown dictionary this volume), the implications of such Living were being enacted existentially at an exploded magnitude as meridians, centers, yu-points and plexi in the Mother's \"personal\" being bore full burden in intensified convergence of artificial manipulations, trauma- tizings and poisonings wreaked through grid-lines of the planetary field, at the same time as those loci of the bodily temple were being deliberately bruised and abraded by direct higher-dimensional intent aimed squarely in retaliation to her persistent Rebuffs. Thus though Southern Crown has a small household Order of student-initiates dedicated to serving the Spiritual Process in the world at various levels, so persistent and outrageously unprecedented was the barrage from the Invisible (and quasi-visible), so relentless the assault particularly on AAA's health and bodily-being (manufacturing such critical if shapeshifting symptoms and somatic traumas as to baffle the dubious expertise of the whole UCLA Medical"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"MATRIX N School and a passel of the nation's \"leading specialists\" having otherwise attended such lights as Ronald Reagan), that everyone in the Order had constantly to be pulled off hidher regular function in extemporized closing of yet another gap or unanticipated breach, consequently curtailing or closing down certain SCIT-Bird functions altogether and requiring abrupt suspension of the foreseen \"finishing touches\" on the Mother Book when but a heartbreaking beat away from public birth, in favor of unforeseen elements force-writing the sudden additional Chapter. RougWsporadic communications with subscribers and book-buyers over the year's course continuously demonstrated or pleasantly reinforced the fidelity of the T-Bird readership, and when eventually the critical suspension of publication seemed to warrant offer of full refund (on checks and money-orders never cashed) against future notification of the Book's availability, virtually evevone declined the refund in favor of waiting, for no matter how long an indeterminate time, with best wishes for AAAYs recovery! Thus while the last Chapter of the Mother Book was being penned in \"blood, sweat and tears\" (read the last both as \"lachrymal\" and literally \"ripping\") under indescribably tumultuous conditions honoring neither proprietary bounds nor those of property, personhood, minimal human requirements of rest or superhuman requirements of celestial insulation, all physical work on the Book was contrastively suspended. The Dread Mother Book Rides Forward (Again) From Besieged Castle Walls As Providence (an interesting coincidence of personal opportunism and cosmic require- ments) would have it, at the beginning of this whole period W called the Temple from Yelm with the proposition for the present book; since his informing idea was of the Highest and certainly coincided with what MT had been accomplishing, seeding as subtle influence and otherwise forwarding in his own sphere (i.e. that of producing a Work of first principles to furnish mankind at large a Living Manual toward spiritual adeptship, and as antidote to much plausible-sounding but actually suspect \"off-planet\" transmissions) MT set about immediately, working with as great dispatch as circumstances would allow, in fWXng and fleshing-out the Valerian mandatum mundata. Thus temporarily sacrificing completion of the very Mother Book which had so occupied his most loving labors for years, he turned with inhuman intensity to the inspiriting of this unexpected Opening toward public edification and advancement (providentially Appearing at the precise moment the Primary avenue seemed closed for repairs). There is no way for any (3rddensity) soul to know or to appreciate--and certainly no one with whom the adept spoke during this whole period seemed in any way either capable of or interested in learning how to know or to appreciate--what it is like laboring night and day at every available hour over the most abstruse yet essential material in an effort to wrest it within range of the general comprehension, all the while attentive to and mediating the abrupt minute-to-minute changes in subtle energy-shields, requirements for occult fortification and the harrowing incursions frequently made upon one's own wife and Master of the Mother-current suffering several times near fatal lapse, being rushed to hospital emergency rooms, administered hasty treatment as the whole range of orthodox and unorthodox methods largely stood mute in mindless impotence at the manifest holocaust wreaked from realms-unknown on her immune system and glandular complexes, her intestinal tract and mandibular-temporal \"switchboard\" of nerve clusters cutting off breathing, salivation, tearducts, swallowing, drinking or eating of the most minuscule amounts by turns-d"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV this all the while AAA herself somehow superhumanly managed to maintain near perfect continuity in the teaching of her formal studentclass as well as administering!supervising!Performing daily household business!

This fvst exercise is called the Charger Breath. Become very familiar with it, use it often evexy day, for it is the fouudation of the system. 1. Do all breathing exercises sitting down, the first few days of practice. Use a comfortable chair, preferably straight-back so that your spine is nice and straight at all times during the exercise. Your feet should be flat on the floor, hands resting in lap or on knees. Head straight, facing frontally. Clothes should be loose (or none) and all belts, buttons or zippers about the abdomen should be loosened for maximum comfort and abdominal expan- sion. 2. Fix your gaze on a point straight ahead. This is an important step to begin with because it helps you concentrate on the breath without distraction. Later when you do the breathing randomly throughout your day while walking etc, this step may of course be eliminated. 3.The Charger Breath. Inhale deeply, strongly, even fretcely through the nostrils. Inhale just as deeply and powerfully as you possibly can. Inhale all the way, 'ti1 you've gotten every last possible drop of air. Without holding or pausing, immediately exhale, strongly, evenly and thoroughly. This is a very strong, powerful breath; there's nothing timid or half-way about it. This is not the slow, quiet and gentle breath you may be used to or come to expect in association with the ordinary yogic techniques. This is more like a Tibetan Bomber, a full-throttle Samurai Snort. In order to perform it properly, you should go so far as to scrunch up your face, actually wrinkle your nose into a kind of ferocious expression similar"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV to those stylized masks of Japanese Noh. With your Noh nose properly crinkled and pumping, you ought to look very much like a cartoon bull, snorting and blowing the bellows of those nasal wings as if you could lift full sail by tackiing into the wind. 4. Now in your best, cartoon bull fashion, take three successive Charger Breaths. Remember as you con- centrate on the point in front of you, to make each breath as strong and even and thorough as possible, both in and out. The expiration of each breath should be done as thoroughly as the inspiration, so that you are forcefully expelling the very last drop of air. As you do these breaths in succession, you should--if you're doing it properly- sound like a freight train bearing down the track. Don't forget, this is a very power$ul bteath, not at all a timid or faint-hearted breath. It is accomplished crisply, with inci- siveness. It should produce a loud mshing sound as it surges through your nostrils, like the suction of a powerful vacuum. As you become more accomplished, you should be able to whiskgnats out of the air and produce eddies of loose papers on your desk (anyway, you get the general idea). 5. At this stage you may do several complete rounds of the three Charger Breaths. Take three deep, powerful, decisive and thorough Charger Breaths. On the exhalation of that third breath, pause for a few moments (the third breath should be done with particular strength and emphasis; there is a' tendency for some students to let the last breath tail off, as if they're in a hurry to go through the repetitions. The opposite should be the case; the last breath of the series should be particularly strong, thorough and emphasized). During the few-moments pause, you should .make sure that your facial muscles, shoulders, neck, arms and legs are completely returned to a state of relaxation. The spine should always remain straight. Don't ever slouch or slump forward. Do another series of three breaths, pause a few moments, relax; then do the third series of three Charger Breaths. After the last series, sit still and feel. What do you feel like? What is the difference? 6. Increase the number of series-repetitions of the three Charger Breaths (for example, increase the count to seven by performing three Charger Breaths, pausing and relaxing, another three and so on until you've gone through seven whole rounds). Again, after completion of the seventh round, sit still and feel. 7. After some practice with the increased series-repetition, you should practice a shorter three-round series again only with a larger group of Charger Breaths, ie. you should practice in clusters of fwe or seven Charger Breaths, repeating each cluster three times with pause and relaxation etc, as per previous instruction. Next, using the larger group of Charger Breaths (clusters of frve or seven etc), you should increase the overall series-repetition again to a frve or seven round series, ie. take seven deep, strong Charger Breaths, pause and relax, take seven more etc until you've completed five (or seven) repetitions. Always sit still afterwards, relax and feel the effect."},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Remember that the Charger Breath should be practiced sitting down at least the first couple days; one of the effects you may feel when first practicing the Breath is a kind of light-headed or giddy feeling. This is an effect of possible hyperventilation, and is the reason we recommend doing the Breath at first only while sitting down. Consistent practice of the Charger Breath will acclimate your system to a more positive and invigorating ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide in the bloodstream and tissues, and the threshold of hyperventilation will quickly be pushed back. After a few weeks of regular practice you may well be able to do high numbers of series-repetitions using a big seven-group of breaths without experiencing any effects of hyperventilation at all. Breathing Tips: the proper way to breathe is by abdominal expansion and contraction, not chest expansion and contraction. When you inhale, the Breath should cause the abdomen to be expressed or pushed out; it should not inflate the chest exaggeratedly as we are sometimes taught (improperly) in gym class, and it should not cause the shoulders to heave up and down unduly. On the exhalation the abdomen should automatically deflate and relax. Practice this abdominal breathing, even watch yourself in the mirror to see that the chest is not acting more than the abdomen, until it becomes second nature. This is in fact the body's natural breath, so that anything which emphasizes chest expansion over abdomen is artificial, learned and inappropriate. Note: You may practice Charger Breathing every bit as much in a relatively polluted atmosphere like Los Angeles, as you can in relatively pollution-free environment like the country (if you can find a pollution-free country). It may seem that you'd be taking toxins and pollutants more deeply into the lungs than would ordinarily be the case; but chronic, superficial or shallow breathing takes all those pollutants in as well, and because it doesn't respire so deeply and thoroughly it fails to flush the alveoli of the bronchi, leaving harmful and carcinogenic pollutants to stagnate in the deeper strata of the lung-tissue. Charger Breathing cleanses and purifies those tissues by bringing necessary quantities of oxygen to their cells which otherwise would not penetrate, and by flushing old impacted pockets of carcinogenic matter sedirnenting the deeper layers of the system. In future issues of The New Thunderbird Chronicle we will describe further benefits and health-re- siduals to be obtained from practicing the Charger Breath. Note: Do not practice Charger Breathing in the car with the windows rolled up, or on the highway. You may feel after weeks of practice that you are past the point of hyperventilation, so that it would be safe to Breathe while driving. However, the automobile (and especially in conjunction with the fi-eeway system) circulates exhaustfirmes through the cab of the car; exhaust fumes are tricky, for you may do a long series of Charger Breaths in the car feeling no ill effects, no giddiness or blurring of perception, then stop for a few moments and suddenly feel the onrush of a fainting spell produced by the accumulated intake of fumes. In the following months we will add to the technique and application of Power Breathing, with special reference to the cornerstone method of the Charger Breath. Look for us, and follow the special instruction we give to all, hly, in these pages month to month, follow the instruction as it's given, and you can't help but feel the resultant Change. In order to know what the great Change is that we're talking about, you must follow and do the practice. Don't forget: Do your Charger Breathing daily. It is very important. Make the Power Breath more popular than jogging. [First published in 7NTC Vol. I, No. 2 Aug.-Sept. '891 For those who're coming to this column for the first tie, we recommend you practice a few days on the preliminary Charger Breath before progressing to the current lesson. A summary of that Breath is as follows: (until you become acclimated to the very tangible, strong, awakening"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1V power of this breath, we recommend that you practice it seated, in a comfortable chair which keeps the spine straight and vertical, face straight ahead, feet flat on floor, hands relaxed on knees or in lap). Breathe very strongly, evenly and thoroughly through the nose, powerfully drawing the air in as deeply as possible; exhale through the nose with equal strength and thoroughness. This is characterized as afierce breath. It should produce a loud rushing sound, like the steam blasts given off by old-time engines. Do this fierce, pumping Charger Breath several times in a row, pause. Relax. Feel. Repeat Do a few such repetitions of this basic cluster of Charger Breaths. Increase the number of breaths in a cluster, and then the number of repetitions of the-expanded-cluster (i.e., do five Charger Breaths, repeat this groupfive whole times with pause and relaxation between each group performance). Lesson Two: Whole Charger Breath 1. Do all new breathing exercises sitting down at least the first several sessions of practice, regardless whether you've already practiced the previous variations. This is because each modification of the basic breath, or each introduction of a supplemental technique, produces a different effect on the system (whether a strongly diierent or subtly dHerent effect); even if you're thoroughly acclimated to the effects of previous exercises, this does not therefore \"inoculate\" you against the modified effects which each new lesson introduces. Always sit with spine straight, clothes loose (or none), feet flat on floor, hands relaxed on knees or in lap. Fix your gaze on a point straight ahead to aid in concentration while performing the Breath. 2. Perform a succession of three powerful Charger Breaths, as you should be by now accustomed. Inhale strongly and sharply, thoroughly through the nose, then exhale with similar vigor, evenness and maximum expulsion of air also through the nos-cept, this time, on the last repetition of the Charger Breath, the exhalation is to be performed through the mod. To do this correctly, the lips should be compressed leaving only a very slight gap, virtually imperceptible to vision, through which the air of the exhalation is allowed to escape. This has the effect of greatly slowing the last exhalation. The use of such scarcely-pursed lips regulates the flow of air much more dramatically and \"voluntaristically\" than can be done by breathing out through the nose. There are two basic ways of allowing this last exhalation of the series to take place: the breath may be expelled by a kind of deliberate pressure, ie. actually blowing out through the slight gap of the lips; or it may be allowed to \"ease\" away as if on its own, the air being leaked very slowly and evenly by the natural contraction of the abdomen and consequent deflation of the diaphragm without any deliberate \"blowing\" on the part of the practitioner. This last breath makes the final series-exhalation especially slow; and it is only when the escaping air has left the lungs in their normally-relaxed state that deliberate expulsion of the remaining C02 in the air sacs is called for, finishing off the final series-breath with a distinct, pressurized puff. It is recommended that the practitioner favor the method of deliberately (though slowly) blowing the air through the lips on the last exhalation, at the beginning of each Whole Charger Breath session; but that, during the numerical increase of breath-clusters and"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV series-repetitions in which the Breath is performed, the practitioner should gradually switch to the much slower method of allowing the air to simply \"leak out\" the tiny labial opening (like the scarcely perceptible leak of air from a minutely punctured balloon) on the automatic deflation of the diaphragm. The reason for this progression has to do with the greater comfort experienced while \"relaxing\" the breath out of your system, the more saturated in surplus oxygen the system becomes; the further into your Charger Breath session, the more deeply you will have succeeded in altering the ratio of oxygen to C02 in the blood in favor of oxygen; therefore the less likelihood there is of feeling that faint \"panic\" for air that might otherwise be felt if you tried \"leaking\" the last series-breath at the beginning of your session. 3. Perfom several complete rounds of the three Whole-Charger-Breaths always breathing through the nose, in and out, except on the last series-breath where you breathe very slowly, evenly and thoroughly out the mouth, through scarcely pursed lips. Pause, relax completely (always keeping spine and head straight) and feel at the end of each round, before proceeding to the next cluster of three Whole-Charger-Breaths. Next, increase the number of breaths in a cluster (i.e., from 3 to 5, later from 5 to 7 etc); and then increase the number of rounds each amplified series of Breaths is performed (ie., from 3 rounds to 5, later from 5 to 7 etc). Remember: always breathe out through the mouth only on the last exhalation of the given series (for example, the three-breath series: in-nose, out-nose; in nose, out nose; in nose, out mouthdnd of round). There is no \"count\", as in many breathing exercises, so don't worry about measuring the inhalations and exhalations against each other according to some standardized ratio (2 to 4 etc). After practicing in the seated position several times during each day, you will have succeeded in pushing back the threshold of possible hyperventilation to the degree that you can perform the Whole-Charger-Breath randomly, while walking, standing etc. You should resort to this random charge-up often. You'll find it makes you feel better in general, more alert and vigorous in particular, with a balanced amplification of the overall sense of poise, ease, confidence and well-being. Best of all, this practice sets the first (though necessary) foundation-tiles for succeeding months' instruction in which you'll learn to apply the Breath and its modifications for important work in rousing dormant faculties and functions, sparking higher agencies of psychic, emotional, mental and spiritual potential while speeding the harmonious integration of whole-Being systems and circuits for improved health and a deeper, more essential happiness. But you must keep up your practice daily. Maintain a diary or calendm to remind yourself, and to record your successes in meeting your schedule with the Power Breath. Also, leave helpful notes and messages around the house (taped to the refiigerator, wedged in the mirror-frame), in the car (visor, dashboard) and even at work (fixed to the me-cabinet, under the glass of the desktop). Such messages can simply remind you: BREATHE! Follow the instruction as it's given, and you can't help but feel the resultant Change. In order to know what the great Change is that we're talking about, you must follow and do the practice. Don't forget: do your Charger Breathing daily. It's very important.

We'll try to respond to any significant questions you may have, either in the monthly Power Breathing column itself or in Letters to the Editor. [First published in TNTC Vol. I, No. 5 Dec. '891 Lesson Three: Tips For The Balance From our recent enjoyable experience at the Expo, we find that many have begun a conscientious practice of daily Power Breathing as taken right out of these pages; many others should now be encouraged to join the practice having been initiated directly into its healthy, rejuvenating and Awakening benefits. We find (in speaking with people, fielding questions or simply hearing general comments) that, once having overcome the plain inertia discussed in our very first lesson as the principal impediment to even wing the easy methodology, the inherent effectiveness and immediacy of the practice encourages quickly turning up the front-burners of enthusiasm. Thus those who've experienced even the preliminary, first-time uplift of the practice sense a self-renewal stirring suddenly inside that's so innately exciting they wish to know immediately how to extract all the gold out of their newly discovered Mine. It's to this question that we address our (abbreviated) column this month. Though you're sure to feel that, if just a IittIe of this breathing regimen does so much and moves your systems so far then a lotmust portend some rapid and inconceivable Transformation, it's wise to allow the practice to open all the centers and energetic lines in a natural, balanced way. Your systems know, and can certainly tell yo& how much you're capable of absorbing and efficiently processing at one time; but it is possible, in an overriding rush of enthusiasm, to push the practice down a long-distance stretch right away thus forcing into far zones before the cues of your system have a chance to register. This inordinate enthusiasm, perhaps fueled by the gratifying upsurge of additional energy but coupled to a long-starving psyche just now realizing the extent of its deprivation and wishing to \"make up for lost time\", may serve temporarily to overtax the present capacities of your system. The common result may be, no. 1 : Unnecessary extremes of hyperventilation. As was explained at our lecture-dem- onstration at the Expo, \"hyperventilation\" is only an initial effect or potential of applying the Power Breathing regimen; the light-headedness you may experience at first progressively diminishes with practice. It results in any case from the increase of energy--produced by the Charger Breath4riving the consciousness-systems to the ceiling of their current (condi- tioned) capacity for sustaining the minimum degree of focal resolution necessary to maintain effective alignment with the \"Waking\" zone of common perceptual coherence. Those systems are temporarily pushed past the ordinary threshold separating the narrow-band waking zone of consciousness from the more diffuse medium of psychic energy-processing in which the concentrated spark of self-reflective awareness has yet to be struck. That \"regiony' of energization in which the ordinary low-level harmony supportive of-normal-self-reflective awareness tends to dissipate, accompanied by the seeming \"swoon\" of that awareness, represents the pons asinorum in the present intersection of your optimal \"conscious lights\" with the zone of your greater Being (presently understood as subcomcwus, and only \"known\""},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV by reflection from fragments reclaimed out of the dreamstate). Progressive, balanced and unhurried practice of the Whole Charger Breath (in conjunction with supplemental techniques you'll be receiving in the following months, or those specialized meditative practices available on tape'through Southern Crown) will serve unerr- ingly to push back that threshold of hyperventilation. In this way increasingly integral, intensiiied values of self-reflective consciousness are installed in the place of that threshold so as to constitute a continuous salient into the frontiers of formerly subconscious'^ regions-or dimensions of the greater Being--making them available to consciousness and progressively incorporating their functional values as accessible agencies of the \"ordinary\" waking state. In this way the phenomenon of \"hyperventilation\" has progressively less to do with the effects experienced as a consequence of consciously applying the Charger Breathing regimen. The second common result of (understandably) \"overdoing it\" at first in the initial burst of enthusiasm, is that of straining facial or neck muscles. If you've overdone it to the degree that portions of your face, head, neck or back of the head seem to go numb, simply relax, sit still and breathe normally; it's a temporary effect and swiftly recedes. Similarly, if you've failed to be punctilious in these precautions and seem to have strained some muscle or tissue (typically, facial muscles or buccal tissue) again, relax and resume normal breathing. You may have to desist from practicing the Charger Breath with any real vigor or energetic force for a few days until the strain relaxes. These types of over-exertion are minor and transitory disturbances. They do not happen at all when the practitioner conscientiously monitors the response of his systems to those increments of the practice he's assumed according to instruction. You may find that \"progress\" in the overall strengthening of tissue and muscle groups and the receding of the hyperventilation-threshold enabling more extensive applica- tion of the practice, seems \"uneven\"; it may increase smoothly at a clip and then suddenly seem to hit a \"hill\"; you may fmd yourself remaining at a particular number of repetitions and rounds (say, a 7-breath set for 7 rounds) for a much longer time than was the case with previous sets and rounds, as if having come to an impasse. You should enjoy this provisional \"upper limit\" for as long as it seems fired, and refrain from impatience. There is no contest to ''mount to ever-expanding heights of hyper-intensive breathing\". Cooperate with the inherent wisdom of your systems- just don't let lethargy, the fickleness ofpsychological mood or conceptual restraint dictate to you in the pretext that they speak for your actual energy- processes and mind-body systems. The third common result of overpracticing the Power Breath, is the onset of a minor temporary \"headache\". This is a result of energy-concentration produced in amplification of the carrying \"current\", but processed through ordinary avenues belonging to relatively imbalanced circuits of the system that haven't benefited as yet from the greater harmony which measured application of the technique over time inevitably yields. Interestingly, the balanced and intelligently graduated practice of the Whole Charger Breath serves ultimately to relieve even long-time difficulties involving headaches, including migraines. This isn't so dificult to understand, once we note that medical research ascribes the general symptoma- tology of \"migraines\" to a pathological condition of local oxygen-deprivation. Always remember, then, to apply yourself steadily, conscientiously and wisely to the daily practice of Power Breathing.

Using the old English Alphabet of 24 letters by the simple letter-number count, the word Sowe adds to 53. Both Sowe and 53 are frequently used in Baconian cryptography to represent or otherwise indicate the presence of the author. On page 53 of \"Whitney \" we find the picture of a sow rooting (a sow was the ancient symbol of the Mother in societies of the matriarchate, and carried over into times of the Egyptian dynasties as a fertility emblem of the Skygoddess Nuit). Near the sow in the center of the picture is apyramid, identified by various authorities as Bacon's \"favorite symbol for his philosophy\" (Johnson, The Shakspere ii'lusion page 1 10). One side of the pyramid shows a dark A and the other side a light A, \"similar to the dark and light A ornaments in the First Folio of the 'Shakespeare' plays\" (op. cit.). Together with the central A-shaped pyramid, the flanking mirror letters comprise a signature AAA emblem. In conjunction with the rest of the symbolism, it's clear the intent was to associate this classically Baconian signature with a Mothering principle. The pseudonym \"Whitney\" was assumed by Bacon when at Great Yarmouth visiting his Lord High Steward the Earl of Leicester, whose under steward Gefiey Whitney was at that time sent to Leyden with the task of seeing the Choice of Emblems volume through to Plantyn's press publication. \"GeBey Whitney\" was simply converted to \"GeofEey Whitney \", as was typical of so many small alterations worked upon Bacon's pseudonymously assumed identities.

Strangely, philologists now seem certain there's an etymological connection between the Elusinogenic Name and that of the Japanese Sun-goddess Ama Terasu, though little recommends itself in the way of explanation as to how such apparently disparate cultures patently isolated in intercourse might possibly have sown the same mnemonic typology between themselves. However, AAA does"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV apparently render itself, by way of certain keys proceeding both fiom Lucian and Hippolytus, as Ama-Atarseus-Avi (this last part variantly rendered as AVI-LN, AIVB or AIAVA depending on authority cited or, according to the questionable interpretation of Porphyry preserved by Eusebius of Caesarea, depending on the particular usage/intdnation of the daduchos or hierokeryx at given intervals of the rite-whether invoking Her aspect as the Essence, as Bearer of Gladness or Grief, Moderator of curses etc.). In any case it is more certain under authority of Hippolytus that the first two portions of Her name were invariably recited in a kind of liturgical antiphony when her hogshead emblem was displayed by ho epi bomo, the sacrificial priest, such emblem no doubt constituting the Elusinogenic teleiotaton epoptikon mysterion itself. We may not know for certain the content of these most sacred Cthronous-wren rites since they were closed to uninitiates of the general social order, and revealed only by special invitation of its hierophantic moderators. There is evidence however such invitation wasn't confined solely to candidates in the membershipculture but was on occasion extended to those of neighboring societies, often as far as Patroclos to the north (apparently the appellation \"barbarian\" applied to the latter by the host society had no true bearing on qualifications for or potential candidacy to the Mysteries. This fact is no doubt connected to the $ynmtism and polytheism indicative of the conquering Kronons, traits known to foster forbearance and a type of incorporative tolerance for the invaded cultures, their deities and peoples.) Though we may not with certainty detail the actual proceedings of the rites of AAA themselves, begun each year on Boedromion 21 and completed late September of the Julian year (possibly, the 22nd of September or the Autumnal Equinox), a fair approximation of their spirit if not their content may be derived from known myths incorporating characteristics and attributes of the goddess and of her chief consorts. Thus in Mygraves we find a version of the common myth, celebrated amongst the greater Kronon population and neighboring societies from pre-Helic times till at least the post-Tempfl* restorations, regarding the wanderings of one Imach Shomiv V'Char-gojen and his efforts to obtain the Sacred Firebird GShEQI (literally, \"Firebird-All-Know- ing-Everything\"). According to most redactions of the myth which Mygraves simply reiterates, the protagonist V'Char-gojen had long sought the Likeness of the legendary Firebird in the old country of Ritzeus-Keys @resumed archeologically to correspond to an ancient Mycenaean settlement at the same approximate site of sacred buildings dedicated to the Ama-Avi Mysteries in historical times). Having no success on his own but continuing, impelled by greed of what possession of the Bird's Likeness implied in terms both of sublime and mundane knowledge, V'Char-gojen was at last directed to the Cave of Machpellah at the abyssal edge of Amaten Mountain--his instructor being variously a torchbearing Harpy, a Valerian plant or a featherless Moa depending on the region and timeperiod fiom which the tale is taken. He is instructed to recite the magical cry \"Iakch 'o Iakche\" upon approaching the bridge to the lesser chasm that leads to the Enchanted Cave directly overlooking the Abyss of the Greater. Thus V'Char-gojen proceeds safely over the bridge, noticing however while he does that in the ravine below is a veritable rack of bleached bones belonging to sundry deceased who'd challenged the bridge unfortified by technical knowledge of the \"cry\". At the pitch-black entrance of the Cave he stops, and shouts as per instruction: \"Oh Mahakala, great Black Transcendental Lord of Wisdom and revered husband of Ama-Atarseus-Avi: I, Imach Shomiv V'Char-gojen entreat you by the Names of Iakche and Kore, Kteis and Mnemosyne and Gamymede to call upon your wife the All-powerfhl goddess AAA forthwith that she may furnish me a Perfect Likeness of the Firebird GShEQI.\""},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV At first there's a pause; we may presume that, where the actual mysteries parallel these features of the myth, the candidate awaits to see whether the hierokerp will respond as anticipated allowing him to pass to the greater Hall. Presently an echoing Voice, at first frightening to Imach in its resounding abruptness, issues hm the blackness of Machpellah Cave: \"It may be as you wish,\" the Mighty Mahakala intones, \"but you must wait. Since you've appealed for the Firebird's Likeness, it will take some time for Ama to fashion it so the Image is magickally effective; and she must fashion it only with one hand, for her Other and right hand is wholly occupied in battling the Demons of Amaten Abyss. Since we are the only Deities who may dwell in the Pit while retaining our place in Heaven, we are the only ones standing between the host of hell here with us and the World outside beyond the cavewalls, where dwell you yourself and all your kindred.\" On hearing this, Imach Shomiv V' Char-gojen bridles, and begins to balk; but, recovering himself, he inquires discreetly \"how long then must I wait?\" \"I can't tell you, precisely,\" comes the reply, \"but you may retum tomorrow.\" Bright and early on the 'morrow, V'Char-gojen returns, giving the appropriate cry of Iakch 'o Iakche in order safely to cross the bridge and then repeats his request in the same phraseology at the caveentrance. This time the resounding voice of the great Black Transcendental Wisdom Lord Mahakala issues from the impenetrable darkness of the cave-mouth, saying: \"V'Char-gojen, you worthy soul knowing the password to Chaironyx Bridge-I have requested the Likeness of the Firebird on your behalf to my Wife, and it may be as you wish; but you must wait as She's only able to fashion it with her lep hand as her right hand is wholly occupied with battling the demons of Amaten Abyss. And, because of the aeonic length of this battle and the fact we have no other help except the occasional candidate (such as yourself) Heaven might see fit to send us, Ama-Atarseus-Avi has become very weak and is now passing sick. So again I say that you must wait\" At first V'Char-gojen is almost audibly upset; feeling however that, being deep inside the Cave and utterly Invisible neither Mahakala nor Ama may perceive his vexed vituperative expression, Imach quickly recovers audible composure while the grimace clings fast to his face and inquires, in the meekest tone he can muster: \"Then how long must I wait?\" \"That I cannot say with exactitude, dear Imach,\" came the reply, \"but you are privileged to retum the next day and ask again.\" The next day, Imach is at the cave-entrance even before the orange of dawn can crawl across crenelated clouds above the mountaintops; in a voice he doubtless assumes, with ravaging impatience, is a model of restraint, Imach asks again and again the voice roars up from the darkened entrance in response. \"It may be as you wish, but you must wait.\" This time it occurs to Imach that, as with all such fabled procedures, three times is certainly the charm; this is surely that type of test which tries the patience of the most forbearing but, marked beforehand by its patent limit may encourage perseverance of the canny past its penultimate osti,utting. He need but retum again, and such virtue of persistence will surely be rewarded as the three-fold masks of opposition are ceremoniously lowered in revelation of the pedestaled and preening Firebird, from which all the wealth-gamering knowledge in the world may be freely taken. In the meanwhile, swelled with the magnanimity permitted by imminent triumph, Imach casts his glance quickly about and providen- tially perceives a summana plant, legendarily capable of curing any ill. He swiffly rips it out of the ground, unmindful of its tender roots, and, casting it down into the foreboding pitch of Machpellah Cave he shouts after it: \"I have gone to great expense and much trouble of time to find precisely"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV what your beleaguered wife most sorely needs. Have her brew an extract of these wondrous roots and she shall be well before the day is out.\" The voice of Mahakala deep within the. cavern issues gratitude at the gift; and Imach, satisfied that his sacrificial offering would dispose the gods favorably toward granting his request, departs only to return early the next morning. Having cannily calculated his ritualized combination of moves for this the portentous third effort, the self-styled candidate V'Char-gojen calls down into the pit with nary pause nor ablution for holy composure, \"how is your Wife, Oh great Mahakala? and how is She coming with the Likeness of the Firebird you promised me?\" There ensues what to lmach is an unacceptable silence, an uncomfortable--even irritating-pause before Mahakala's subdued voice eventually rejoins: \"Ama-Avi is still very ill, oh worthy Imach; though she has never ceased working on the Firebird Likeness, such a thing must be done with surpassing care simply for the sake of your safety and well-being; and we must add to the native delicacy and even tediousness of such work the inescapable fact that Ama must perform this task with her lefi hand alone, for her right is wholly occupied with keeping the demons of Amaten Abyss at bay which work is also for no one's sake other than yours.\" \"Yes, yes,\" Imach replies with ill-concealed disappointment and an impatience no longer so willing to suffer the suppression of its imperious sovereignty, no longer so sanguine to subordinate its own indignant right to self-expression. \"But has she taken the summana plant 1 obtained for her at such trouble and expense?\" The reply was u~lsatisfactory; Imach could scarcely make out what obfuscating babble Mahakala seemed to be speaking at this point, as he answered in a voice so soft it might have been that of an old woman mumbling prayers under her breath at the sanctuary of Heliclos beseeching the healing fountains for some twilight hour fertility--Imach was chagrined to believe he was hearing incomprehensible matters having to do with the c'transcendental nature\" of the Mother- Goddess, how she wasn't like any mortal who might ''take something\" for an ache or pain and be swiftly healed in the protective insularity of an individualized self-enclosure or Auric \"shell\", but how instead her \"Health Aura\" was an open continuity to and for the world, a sublime and sanctified Spirit-aura to which all things were associated umbilically and through which all \"private\" energies secretly circulated like the purifying womb-egg of the Mother, in which the fetus-consciousness abides and is continuously fed and cleansed ... These things Imach heard, but scarcely, as he was not disposed in the fust place to strain himself unduly over the softer tones emanating up from the Cave--and since what he did seem to hear was a clear aflkont to his own sovereignty as a being owing nothing to anything much less to the Divine Process that was pleased to serve the beating of his heart and effortless whisper of his lungs ... Imach interrupted Mahakala's barely intelligible speech, intruding the sole important theme in no-nonsense manner, \"cutting to the chase\" with admirable efficiency as it were ... \"Then just how long must I wait?\" As an answer did not immediately issue up out of the cave, Iprach blanched and had manfully to check an onrushing fit of apoplexy-after all, he'd waited the decent formal interval of three full times in uncustomary supplication before the cavemouth at which no visible appearance deigned to palliate his indignity ...in the midst of recomposing himself, Imach Shomiv V'Char-gojen was mildly startled to hear a horrible and multitudinous Wail emit instead fiom deep within the Cave. It did not sound at all like Mahakala, nor did he believe it could be Ama-Atarseus-Avi though he'd never really heard her Voice; but it was an awfd cacophony, a hideous roaring upswell of cackling and keening as if carrion creatures were of a sudden rejoicing at some providential death in the wilderness.

Though sheets of fire soon belched from the cavemouth, and a dark rumble like an earthquake from the Kore made him momentarily tremble in response, Imach was soon secure in his belief that the whole ruckus, whatever it was, was confined below. He did not realize that part of what Mahakala had been trying to tell him in such soft voice, was that owing to Ama-Avi7s Purifying and Mothering continuity with the whole They were uncommonly knowledge- able as to the way in which disturbances seemingly taking place deep within the \"separateness\" of the Cave actually stretched out on flowlines like a fanning horse's tail sending flaws and fissures all through the very ground on which Imach stood, so that at any time such solid-seeming earth could split and crack straight under his too-confident feet disgorging hosts of demons as it did so. Yet of this Imach knew nothing, for he had scant patience to hear anything but the word as to how long he must now wait. He was given such word, therefore, after the horrid din died down, being told merely to return tomorrow. Three more times Imach came back, in an early morning hour he knew would leave him the whole rest of the day giving him a great head start on extracting treasure from the Firebird; but he did not receive the promised Firebird on these occasions, though he was carefuily courtmus to obey the ritual form by inquiring first (or, at least, sometime) \"how is your Wife?\" before demanding to how if the Likeness of the Firebird was ready for him or how long he must wait if it weren't. These repeating passages of the Ama-Avi myth are almost certainly reflections of the actual Mystery proceedings of the goddess' sacred rites, and probably served as \"instructions\" for the potential candidate; from the interpretations of Mygrave and ingenious archeological studies of the Sutcliffe school, a certain soupcon of intelligibility is extracted hm the Stew of fragmentary evidences leading scholars to conclude that the candidate to the Avian mysteries was inducted under precisely such challenges; the cautiomy character of the myth dovetails with studies of socio-re- ligious propriety and contemporary etiquettes of the Kronon culture so it seems safe to conclude the \"Imach\" character furnishes a crude cartoon of the extreme negative model, i-e. a veritable \"what not to do\" during the course of the Mystery proceedings unmistakable to the most opaque aspirant or northern barbarian of Myle, a region apparently famous to the Kronons for its general loutishness. It seems rather clear from scholarly reconstructions that the appropriate behavior of the candidate would consist in making preliminary inquiry after the Firebird, then on hearing of the ill-health of the Mother merely inquire thereafter-with sincerity--as to her well being, prudently refiainingfiom making anyfirrrher mention of the \"Firebird\" for an indefinite length of time (apparently the three-fold call between candidate and keryx functioned as a formal minim during celebration of the rites, but could be repeated a variable number of times in practice depending on conditions of the season, attributes or characteristics of the candidate etc.). In any case the myth ends, with this illustrative negative model, at the point Imach Shomiv V'Char-gojen is satisfied at last in his insistent request and receives the Likeness of the Firebird, magickally transported on Air out of the Machpellah cave with brilliant peacock crest and flaming pages of electric feathers fluttering and flowing like an opalescent ermine to the ground behind it-its Eyes two gemlike discs issuing lights in all directions; but of all this Imach is manifestly unaware as he abruptly seizes what is his Due, and without further ceremony or pretense"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of show before the black mouth of Machpellah Cave stalks off to find a solitary place where he may interrogate the Likeness at Leisure, and extract fiom it all the expected Treasures. A nanative coda to the myth is often appended, ensuring that the hearer understands: had the erstwhile \"candidate\" Imach approached ivith ritual propriety and a sincere heart, he'd automatically have had the patience to wait forever, not for the Firebird Likeness but for Word of the Mother's recovery and well-being so that in the End he would not have received the Likeness of the Firebird at all (thus, he would not have \"created his own\" reality and so would have been spared the calamitous consequences of that uninitiate orientation to the legendary Mysteries); he would not have received the Likeness of the Firebird since in his authentic caring he would have long abandoned the conceit of \"personal reality creation\" altogether therefore abandoning selfish attachment to his request, and inferentially to the things with which he was most identified (i-e. the \"treasures\" devolving hm \"possession of the Firebird's Likeness\"). He would not have received the Firebird's Likeness, but rather (the hearer is assured) he would have received the Firebird Itself, in the form of the Personal Appearance to him of the Whole and Restored Mother fiom out the black cave of Machpellah. This indeed seems to be the actual denouement of the Ama-Avi Mysteries, when the goddess herself emerges fiom a cavemouth entrance to the accompaniment of thrashing sistnuns and torchlight to Receive the successful candidate. The hearer is informed as well in this useful Coda, how Imach had he merely adhered to formal propriety (being in his constitution incapable of the requisite sincerity), refraining hm announcing the trouble, time and expense it took him just to get to Machpellah Cave etc. and discreetly inquiring after the Mother's well-being according to minimum formal prescription of the rites, would have been able at least to walk away with the Likeness of the Firebird in relative impunity--rather than suffering the irreversible Subtraction hm the wholeness of his Soul-being thereafter accompanying every emolument and prize received from possession of the Firebird till finally being eroded by weight of his sum acquisitions both in body and soul to a final Oblivion.

Two important ideas flow immediately from this fact alone: first, the Gnostic \"viewpoint\" necessarily implies that, whatever \"Absolute\" should prove to be, It can't be separate from the subject who would \"know\" it Far fiom such gnosis involving a conceptual confusion between \"knower\" and \"known\" as some commentators have suggested (as if all the \"knower\" could ever know would necessarily have to be self-estranging, objectified objects of knowledge), it embodies the primary wisdom-insight that, in order to qualz~ as Absolute such reality can't be other than the subject who would \"know it\". Implied in this, is that Absolute is-minimally-all-inclusive. Should the \"initiatory subject\" prove to be other than or apart from the Absolute he determines to Be, such \"absolute\" necessarily fails the first test Thus, whatever Absolute ultimately is, it must be more than \"knowable\" in the usual conceptual sense, since any concept no matter how defnitionally inclusive can't-self-evidently& considered equal to reality as a whole. Any conceptualization of the theme immediately belies its indispensable element of comprehensiveness, since the cognizing subject can never be delimited by or pinned down to a concept. Another necessary implication immediately springs forward; the \"Knowing\" required of an Absolute needn't depend on defmition through the common organs of knowledge. There is a fundamental sense in which the value of knowing ontologically precedes the specific \"organs of knowledge\" that may enforce its spirit categorically. To Knav something in this primary sense is inseparable from being, identical to and consistent with that which is to be known. There is a trick clause embedded in this (progressively selfevident) requirement. First of all, we see the wisdom of this reasoning; all those things conventionally considered \"known\" as a matter of course, e.g. the objects of eon, the litany of familiar ideas circulating through the \"interior monologue\" etc., can't possibly be \"known\" in any but aping way. Indeed they fit the Tibetan metaphysical analysis as kunji namparshespa, \"acquaintance- knowledge, basis of everythingw--that is, our knowledge of ideas and objects is a kind of chronic \"passing acquaintance\" rather than irreducible knowing since every such object of knowledge is necessarily conditional, externally and internally; externally, \"idea\" or \"object\" is conditional in the sense of pure contingent juxtaposition. Everything occurs along with everything else (the Buddha's \"interdependent originations\"), and in no \"eternal order\" at that! but as a pure function 4 of contingency; contingency, in turn, is a function ofperspective. Some would insist 'perspective \"is a product of contingency, e.g. Sartrian phenomenol- ogy; astute analysis shows, however, that 'kontingency \" is an observational hypothesis issuing j?om the irreducible immediacy clinging to the fact of perspective4n the other the existence of '@rspective \" as product of contingency is the result of reasoning inference; it shares no symmetxy with respect to the observational hypothesis of \"contingency\" as a function of perspec- tive. The latter is an irreducible datum belonging only to the simple immediacy of observation: shift the locus ofperspective and the contingentjuxtaposition of objects shifts; change the bracketing psychological or subjective ' fperspective\" of the internal monologue, and the order of emphasis amongst ideas shifts and shuffles accordingly; it is not symmetrically simple to establish perspective as a product of contingency: complex hypothetical 'Z.econsmctions \" have to be made with a number of underlying assumptions in support, in order to \"conclude \"upon the case for #val contingency (this is how \"evolutionay \" ideas of chance are derived, e.g. 'your \" existence at this contingent place and time is sum-product of a number of random \"accidents\" or incident"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV impingements generating a unique series belonging to sheer circumstance, giving rise to the induplicable transiency of 'you '3. All of this belongs to the order of external conditionality; the contingency of objects and ideas, as function of perspective, applies to the \"exteriorized\" ordering of cognizable events; yet the modes through which the given, perspectival locus necessarily discems conditiodinterdepend- ent items and ideas, themselves belong to the order of internal conditionality. Note here as well, that we may not leap to any hypothesis of random conditionality (or sheer contingency) for the perspectival locus itself, but may only state the obvious case for all \"externalizing\" phenomena appearing through conditional insbuments. As far as the cogency of our original conclusions is concerned, such instruments are themselves only selfevident functions of perspective, like their corresponding objects--not the other way around. In the cases of both external and intend conditionality, the perspectival limit makes all cognized products descriptively conformant to \"acquaintance knowledge\" only, which consigns them to a partialking \"group\" unsuitable for quaiifying as that kind of knowing commensurate with absolute. The conditionality of all such polarking instruments and corresponding, complementary objects makes the whole format obtained through such means uneqd to the totality of the subject-self moderating the given perspectival locus. Thus all such \"knowledge\" discloses itself as approximation (and instrumental repre- sentation) of a fundamental value informing its operations and undewiting its operations, but for which the products of its operations are ultimately-unsuitable substitutes. We've already seen how any \"Absolute\" must be knowable, since it can't be other than the subject-selfor cognizing consciousness (i.e. Absolute must be non-exclusive). At the same time, we understand how the objects of cognition and perception are onlyprovisionally \"knowable\" since by the rule of contingency they can never correspond to the transcendent totality of the cognizing subject. The perspectival locus, moderated by the subject-self, is curiously without limitation in itself except secondarily by reflection of contingent (and therefore changing) contents. It becomes progressively clear: the only thing that can be known in the ultimate sense is Absolute, since the conditional objects of knowledge can never correspond to the whole-being reality of the subject (which, remember, cannot be other than or apart from Absolute, since Absolute is necessarily inclusive; at the same time, Absolute cannot ultimately be known by anytbjng which is other than It, since to how something implies identi+ven the conditional objects-of-knowledge are expressions of identijkation, i.e. contingent forms of Identity). We're perfectly aware that the above description exactly reverses the classic Shankara definition: \"everything can be known, but the Knower can never be known\". However, honoring the sage's understanding we nonetheless insistently detect a flaw in the description; and here it is: obviously Shankara means that \"everything which can be known is expression of some conditional instrument that-comparatively~llows it to be known, whereas the Knower, being equivalent to the inexpressible totality can never be accounted-for or subsumed through the delimiting focus of the knowledge-instruments (ever reducing-down the whole to a representativelsynthetic part)',. However, we must then ask of this description, from whence comes the value of knowing, which takes such operative delight in the conditional instruments? If the \"knower can never be known\", then \"knowing\" and \"knowledge\" arise mysteriously through Being as obviously futile and superfluous modes! Where's the call for them in the first place? In order to keep up consistency with the classic definition we must credit Maya with a power of illusion, ultimately, that borrows nothing from the very Absolute out of which it contrastively springs! Thus inferentially we grant"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV to Maya an independent creative power, one capable of endowing the whole realm of creation (constitutionally \"without denouement\" in itself) with qualities and properties not to be found in the Creator-source. This introduces an unwanted magnitude;and indeed imbues \"reality\" with an irreducible dualism; Maya, or the creative power of \"illusion\", is inferentially granted equivalency-status with Absolute since She now seems capable of independentlantithetical productions owing nothing whatever to the original Source! \"Knowledge\" now appears as Her own whimsical and extraneous idea; and, deprived of the dignity of innate connection to some Quality native to the Source, it takes on the inferential stature of a demonic endowment proliferating the manifest field for its own sake, like a cancer. We may even see how this isn't just a little desmptive weakness of the traditional (Hindu) viewpoint; it has shipped enormous cargoes offirnctional implication over the centuries, elaborated straight fiom the ideative defects, so that indeed as a yogic orientation the World and all its attributes has tended to be viewed as cjtsfimctional, strictly superfluous and refractorily \"competitive\" with divinity to the degree of being regarded as... a cancer (see the works of Guru Bawa Muhaiyadeen for explicit exposition of this viewpoint). In order to avoid the infinite regress embedded in this implicit philosophical dualism, it's necessary to see that the Shankaraand Southern Crown definitions are not just \"basically two different ways of expressing the same thing\". They arefirndamentalIy different, and have two divergent Worlds of implication branching off from them. We've seen the World implied in the Shankara definition It leads to such doctrinal absurdities and crippling self-contradictory edicts as those modernly issued by the \"Siddha Da Free John\", e.g. regarding the ultimate Divine Agnosticism of Reality (which ranges, illogically, fiom \"we can't know a single thing\" to \"we can't know Absolute, the Divine etc.\" as if the two types of \"knowing\" ranged on an unbroken continuum ...an \"interesting\" proclamation, perhaps, until or unless one were to question the unimpeachability of \"Master Da 's \"Spiritual Realization, at which point of course one is inevitably assailed with an Indubitability cosmic in its Certitude and instantly belying all pretensions to a \"Divine Agnosticism\"...). The World implied in the Southern Crown characterization, on the other hand, does the classically Satanic thing of standing the traditional masters on'their heads, at which point their polka dot underwear shows and we notice that \"Maya\" or the creative power of manifestation necessarily borrows everything She has in Her expressive wardrobefiom Absolute, or Creator-source. Thus the impulse to \"knowledge\" through the inexhaustibility of conditional instruments takes its point of departure from the value of Knowing, eternally resident in Absolute-and resident by virtue of the very \"requirements\" for an \"Absolute\", i.e. the uninterrupted Self-continuity with Itself even through, with, above and beyond all \"conditions\" (themselves eternally \"permitted\" by the All-potential and non-exclusivity of Absolute), a Self-congruence and perfect homogeneity neces- sarily sealed by a seamless Self-coming to Itself which renders Its inherent Quality as a Knowing. Thus we may only truly know what truly Is. That which alone may truly be known, can never be separate fiom or dzjierent than the Knower. This indicates a value of Knowing which is immediate, apodictic, Intuitively whole and self-subsistent without the need of enabling instruments or augmenting appendages but which may enhance and inform such instruments and such append- ages, under conditions of their proper alignment and deferential orientation toward Its informing Presence. That value of Knowing takes its sufficient warrant from the immediacy of Whole-being alone; it is an innate value of Consciousness so that, in mock Mass'of the messy Shankara mockup of Spiritual Realization we may contrarily assert that \"Nothing may ever be known, except the"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Knower\"--(\"Yet she shall be known and I never\": Liber Al vel Legis, 2:4. Note that MT never quotes in reliance from any Source, other than Himself and AAA; therefore see The Great Instauration, Finis, part 111, Liber Al Recurso in The Mother Book). Moreover this Absolute, being inseparable fiom the Knowing of one's total Being, is never necessarily the ultimate rarefied disclosure of an infinitely receding \"last step\" in an initiatory series, as if Absolute could only reside in Sach Kand or Brahm Lok or whatever exclusivist heaven-of-heavens might be posited by the hierarchist in question. Past a certain initiatory threshold of mindlbody integration-alignment minimally congruent with whole-being value, the Spirit of Absolute may be known, tasted, touched, experienced, drawn upon and progressively identified as one's own Being to the degree of indelibility. So surely is this a key feature of all real spiritual practice, and so uniformly is its presence to be found and confessed at every historical juncture of the Mysteries, that we would really have to question any ostensibly \"celestial\" or supramundane source such as \"Bashar\", the Marciniak \"Pleiadeans\" etc. who question the propriety of aposited Absolute. We are here in the position of, say, an experienced airforce pilot listening to someone proclaiming before a rapt audience of enlistees how he has logged in over a thousand hours of flighttime in the ionosphere, how he's test piloted landing craft for Mars, how he's flown shotgun for reentry modules over the Pacific-yet who, when asked an elementary question on aerodynam- ics, bluffly proclaims upon the inauthenticity of any such thing as \"airflow\" or \"wind-resistance\" and further questions the integrity of anyone who doesn't believe you can just flap your arms and fly! For those who yet need an \"answer\" to the sophistries of the aforesaid sources, let's just note that the complete \"relativity\" of everything is an idea which collapses on itself as self-evidently lame. If everything we may experience as \"reality\" is eternally resigned to the \"relative\", how may we know that? What's our reference point for determining the relativity of everything? If everything were 'hlative\" with no contrastive or comparative Reference we would not experience relativity at all, but on the contrary we'd have to experience the \"absoluteness\" of everything equally since everything whatsoever would be equivalent without distinction. The \"relativity\" of any one thing to anything else with no other factor subliminally embedded in the equation, could never serve to modulate the presentational impact of either; for each would ever be offset by an exactly equivalent amount so that a proportional relativity could never be determined. We'd be stuck in a universe where everything was, necessarily, an absolute along with everything else no matter how contra- dictory such a condition would seem, since theperemptory \"relativity\" between each and all without appeal to a higher court allows them no means of contrast and comparison (how do you \"compare\" two things that are equally relative, and therefore exactly equivalent?) Absolutization of \"the relative\" gives no solution but a sophistical one to the tern of existence. And make no mistake about it; by demeaning the idea of Absolute (i.e. Divine Reality) and exalting the idea of pure relativity, the pseudo-philosophus has only succeeded in absolutizing the relative, which is no \"success\" at all. Yet the very identification of a \"relativity\" amongst the compound things, should alert the wise as to the self-evident existence of a comparative and contrastive Standard (through which such relativity would possess a proportional magnitude, permitting a kind of weighing upon a Scales whereby values may receive diminution or increase according to their proximal correspon- dence to the Universal whole-being yardstick).

The breath-soul is distinguishable as the causative agency, or projection of patterning light geometries from Mental Hypostasis of the Creative World (Olah 'm H'Briah) reflecting correlated identity codes toward convergence-nuclei or \"cicatricose\" pockets, indenting the threshold membrane of astral space responsively polarizing-&rough its own level--around saddles and dimples of the informing impressions.

Understanding of the values embedded in the \"argument\" depends on understanding the presence, function and independent consideration of the breath-soul. See also, Ahamkara). For purposes of convenient comprehension we may draw on some general categories which, while basically viable, possess variations in actual expression--much as the worlds of donkey and horse tend to retain their integrity though interesting modulations arise. We may say then that the Identity of an oversoul consciousness (a Noetic Hypostasis belonging to a distinct typology--or ontological category--offirst principles such as Mother, Father, Father-of-Manifestation, Ancient One, Dhyans Chohans etc.) finds within Itself twelve basic or archetypal potentials--think of the Zodiac or Wheel of Stars, the Primum Mobile for example. Oversoul consciousness projects each archetypal phase of its whole-identity by discriminated individuation into the experiential field, to learn about the specific potential possessed by that latent phase. Because each such projection is \"discreted\" through the same essential breath-soul or causative vehicle, such projections may be interpreted as taking place \"by turns\"--though this is more an ontological expression than temporal. Each projection, owing to involved identification- patterns of its experience, projects or \"splits off' in turn an ideal subset of twelve personality variations etc. In practice there may arise such a reified subdivision that the phases become efficiently fragmentary, and have little-to-no opportunity of evolving further (though technically of the degree of Self-consciousness) until or unless a more whole prototype of the fiagmentitious self affects the particular resolution-through venue of its own experience-corresponding to the psychic barrier debarring further advance of the latter. In this case, the barrier seems simply to dissolve for the more fragmentary projection-self, and it thence has available to it real acceleration- potential toward individuation in its own right. As each primary souldivision bm the initial \"twelve\" progresses in integration and coordinate harmonization of faculties and functions toward greater degrees of real awareness (becoming cannier, more wise, more objective in intelligence and more understanding or empathetic in spirit etc.), the subdivisions into which it has apparently fragmented begin to \"knit together\" again so as to form \"composite\" incarnations at intervals that successfully reconcile, resolve and blend into one incarnative agency the formerly separated elements. Eventually one of the original twelve projections absorbs its secondary subdivisions as a whole and is able to incarnate all their organizedmarmonized traits as developed fkom intensifi- cation of their respective experiences. The awareness of the separate \"past\" incarnative fragments are all incorporated in, and constitute the total incarnative potential of, such a Threshold Personality. They are embodied in the additively greater awareness of that Personality and no longer emerge independently. Such a threshold Personality has, then, potential to become a spiritual adept ofprimary degree or significance, correlating with or being equivalent to the Offices of Manu, Bodhisamta or Mahachohan (qv). The Awakening and ongoing service function of this primary twelfth part of the Initiating Oversoul consciousness, acts thereafter as quickening agent for the other eleven aspects so as to accelerate their respective developments and individuations.

Despite themselves, channeled sources may on occasion be recipients of worthwhile material (the percent- ages for this happening, tally pretty closely with any crapshoot). The result is hardly worth the effort, however, since it inevitably comes embedded in material which, even granting the most benign possible motive on the part of both \"anode\" and \"cathode\" is tinted or tainted by \"angle of entry\" (i.e. the particular plane, stage of development, social/mernory/complex etc. hm which the Source broadcasts); by static or active interference hm intervening \"cosmic debris\" and types of consciousness opportunistically distorting every promising \"bit\" wherever allowance hm lapse or lacunae arises (a possibility all-the-more inevitable owing to the functional gap between degree of coherence characterizing density-level of the Source, and optimum degree of mindhody integration-alignment characteristic of the 3rd stage channeler); by the limitations in conceptual/vo- cabulary matrix of the borrowed memory-banks, or by tacit restriction of the channeler's operative worldview placing practical ceiling on the kinds of information allowed (an arbitrary enculturated blinder honored by \"positive\" sources so that- they themselves often confess--they're effec- tively shackled in the latitude of real intelligence representable to terrene recipients, while exploited through ego-inflationary methods of \"negative sources\" capitalizing on and aggravating the outstanding imbalance in the channeler's moral and ethical armoring).

Knight, Ramtha, as a case in point) if for no other reason than to demonstrate how her own standards and balance-of-assessment weren't less substantial and skeptically refined than those of her critics. Such defensive orientation served admirably under the circumstance to sustain a neces- sary monitoring intensity, committing both her and husband Robert Butts to a continuous check and cross-check for continuity, in- textual consistency and plausible congruence with advanced scientific concepts etc. The lIliinifest insouciance or outright vacuity-of-awareness toward the requirement for any such traits all-too-clearly characterizes the subsequent streams of transdimen- sional codependents draining in such drivel as Prism ofLyra, thus irremediably clogging all channels with the preemptive cacophony of Choronzon (qv). Only the Ra material (Ellcins, McCarty and Rueckert [qv]) is of comparable quality-but note the enonnous textuai disparities, the gaping universes of antithetical information pouring hm each respective source (the topic of the existence of \"negative beings\" alone sets contentious architectural foundation for vast, cantilevered extension of soaring argumentative wings and flying Butt-resses disappearing, unresolved, into the galactic clouds.

For example, between the respective paradigms of Seth and Ra: if, along with Seth, we accept that all \"negativity\" is our own negativity, we mustn't fail to brake before the jaywahg conclusion that therefore no negativity exists except by virtue of our own projections and interpre- tations. If all negativity is our own negativity, then others, being none other than ontologically- equivalent with ourselves, possess the potential of such negativity just as well. Thus \"my\" potential for negativity may be reflected from sources and forms of beiig actively engaged in such negativity in their own right--unless we're willing to posit an absolutely solipsistic Universe. Even conceding with the most glazed-eye mystic that All is One and there is no \"other\", there are ~ertainlyfirn~onal \"others\"; that Oneness has to arise by incorporating, resolving and transcending the functional complementarities of \"self' and \"others\", not by denying, ignoring or negating one term in favor of the other (since \"self' is every bit as much a functional hypothesis as \"other\"). Thus to say any negativity is \"my own\" negativity doesn't resolve or explain a thing.

Aleister Crowley (qv) records in his Magickal Diary his hallmark episode of crossing-the-abyss while literally crossing the desert of Bou Sab with his magickal student-assistant Victor Neuburg. Putting aside the arguable question as to whether the Master Therion ever completely succeeded in so monumental a milestone to Magickal accomplishment, it must be noted that only within the framework of the Magickal tradition (with its perennial emphasis on bridging the corporeal and spiritual, of bringing spirit down into practical embodiment through the physical dimension-of-things) had such an endeavor ever actually been made. This is significant for the one reason that such ultimate integration and whole-being resolution between the two seemingly-disparate Magnitudes is inevitably mandated for the corporeal dimen- sion as a whole, and all the class of chronically 3rddensity consciousness associated with it. Such epochal \"crossing\" as Crowley assayed to accomplish presages the Don Juan material of Carlos Castaneda, similarly acting as instructive forerunner for a humanity which--even in its ostensible vanguard-eems reluctant to concede out of its conventional yogic \"withdrawals\" and functional \"separation of the planes\" that such a whole-being physicalized translation can be made to metaphysical Peaks. Yet this is precisely the confkontation of Crossing presently faced by the planet as a whole, as chronic 3rd density (host of physically-focused consciousness) transmutes through implacable processes of Cosmic Timing to the unmasked meta-physical fourth. Such Crossing, being imposed upon the plane and all its corporeatized inhabitants does not, then, depend upon the personal desideration of \"approach\" but visits all its disrupting implications directly upon and through the consciousness of everyone no matter how dismally unprepared. This accounts for all the political, social, economic, national, technological, energetic and spiritual disruption characterizing the calendar of \"current events\" on the planet.

With so many, competing and obviously contradictory \"Christs\" and \"Jesuses\" coming by active interdiction on channeled airwaves owing to guaranteed kneejerk adulation and uncritical obsequy toward the bare whisper of the name, the longstanding archetypal image holding sway over the planet by a priestly and off-planet confidence-game is now manifestly decaying, expiring like an isotope as it sheds its last radiative venom over the planet. The identity of \"that Devil Choronzon\" is given away in the insane susurration and slow crumble of the greasepaint countenance given its last ugly embodiment through insipid \"Sanandas\" and specious sons-of-god sponsored courtesy of \"Ashtar Command\", P.O. Box 333 Betelgeuse in the Constellation Orion. (Note: UFO has the value 666 by Qabala, since vav is equivalent to \"U\", \"F\" and \"0\" in Enghsh.) It has been noted by many who know of such magick things, that \"Choronzon\" is almost identical in spelling and pronunciation, save for an extra vocalized \"n\", to the Spanish corazon, meaning \"spirit, love and heart\". Assuming no such thing as coincidence, may we imply a deliberate \"formula\" thereby? Can it be that, were Choronzon simply to learn to \"spell his name\" correctly, he might undergo a real change of heart? (Amazing what horrors a lack of primary-school education can breed.) Consciousness-unit: Differentiated holonomic locus of Infinite Whole-Being Con- sciousness. Only Infinite Whole-being Consciousness can \"break off\" an exemplary \"part\" of itself without reducing, diminishing, dividing, fragmenting or \"partializing\" Itself through any \"por- tion\". This is owing to the fact that Its wholeness occurs, uniquely, through and by virtue of Infinitude. The Consciousness-unit isn't really a \"part\" or \"fragment\" of the whole, except in the sense that we can say a \"drop\" is a part or fragment of the ocean-indeed, though a drop is manifestly not the whole ocean, neither is it a \"frslgment\" (the way it can be said a chip is a fhgment off a larger stone). There's nowhere in the ocean the drop need \"fit\". The contour of the ocean isn't compromised by subtraction of the drop. The drop is a holocosm of the ocean, not a specialized element out of its greater constitution. The distinguishing signature of the consciousness unit is that, as a locus of the Totality it may seem to \"define\" itself in terms of point-limitation, thusfirnctionally \"fragmenting\" itself or resistively separating itself from the Infinity of its Source. It mayfunction as a virtual or effective discontinuity, with respect to the Whole of which it is holonomic exemplification. To the degree that its discontinuity (or differentiable \"contrariness\") is assumed, it may appear at the far extreme as raw material of anature-unit-4.e. as nature-matter-4 the state of un-, pre- or subconsciousness. At the opposite extreme it may function in the form of consciousness-matter, where it is radiantly self-conscious in different degrees of its own Being as Ideative engagement (or Logoic projection) of the creative field. As such it \"hugs\" to the opaque state ofnature-matter comprising its \"previous\" pre-conscious condition, not in identity with it per se but in reflective self-interpretation of the qualities, values and meanings such delimiting point-potential represents in any given case. In this state. the c-unit as consciousness-matter is equivalent to the Identity of Consciousness through and as Mind. This is the Nous, Novo (intelligible Idea, Logos or Logoic pattern) and Epinoia, Extvota of the Gnostics, in particular as taught by Simon Magus (qv). It is consciousness ideally interpreting the (abstractly-present) potential of the point-limit of Being by drawing on the pre-existent plenum of states at Infinity, and projecting the \"type\" of that akashic limit as coherent/ideofom unity resolvingly integrated through the Logoic pattern."},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV This is the \"mysterious\" mediation of idea and matter referred to by theosophists as Fohat.

However, kundalini-sakti is constituted by pranked nature-units in the degree of sub- and pre-consciousness, woven into geometric coherencies to a brilliant nuclear latency of intelligent- potential by reflective light of Fohat (hypostatic, angelic and ego-intelligences); it is not itself that light, but coiled energy potentials of the geometrically ordered nature-units regulated and aligned through directorial agency (or Logoic emanation) of that Light. The confusion between the two has habitually resulted in the displacement upon, or loaning to, the excited states of the nature-current the creative intelligence and interpretive ideation belonging properly to the percipient, erroneously engendering a kind of slavish worship of the Serpent-power in itself and allegiance to the myriad ego-amplifying agreements reflected through its intensified current, as if the \"yogi's\" initial presuppositions were now proclaimed and supported by \"God\". Crowley, Aleister : Premiere Magician of the 20th century-which may not seem so notable considering the low premium altogether-placed on the category \"Mage\"-until of course we consider the esoteric significance of the subject, leaving popular comprehension abruptly in the null zone. Despite the minimal call for wizards, mages, sorcerers and shamans during the greater part and across the largest portion of this planetary century, Crowley is nonetheless not an utterly unknown figure. His \"reputation\", if not his accomplishments, succeeds in keeping his presence quite alive despite his earthly demise in 1947. It's for this reason, having anticipated the obscurity in which he along with his beloved Occupation were otherwise bound to lapse, that Crowley took principal initiative in circulating all the rumors and maintaining all the gossip about himself. Given the public's predictably Pavlovian response to \"scandal\", and considering that Ernest Hemingway was really no more than a journalist with the most inflated literary reputation in modern history, it was nothing for Crowley to have elicited the Nobel-laureate's real Enquirer instincts in prompt reaction by public proclamation of the Mage as \"the wickedest man in the world\". Seizing on the remarkable good luck of having drawn the fire of this expatriate Parisian bumpkin, Crowley parlayed this and all other gratis publicity into the monument-to-monstrosity as which he towers today. Examined more weWy of course, by the utterly unique method of consulting his own writings rather than the rampant misrepresentations of the righteous, and keeping in mind his \"reputation\" was earned during the early part of the century and in a portion of the world more-than-a-tad hung over with Victorianism, we will wonder whatever might have sent so many reeling in so complete a paroxysm of tmr and disgust. Reconsidered in a true 20th century light and by modern standards, there's nothing in the whole corpus of Crowley's exploits and accom- plishments to suggest grounds for offense greater than anything done by ... Madonna (this cinches Crowley's apostasy for some, we're sureLut the rest get the idea). Much as we hate to disappoint, even the occasional tale of Crowley's having ritually \"sacrificed a virgin youth\" named McAleister is only based on the Mage's own ribald rendition of an onanistic nte wherein he baptized a coaxed exudate en nomini mio and consumed it as consecrated sacrament to some sacred-esoteric aim. (Then"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV again, some may consider this more diabolical than the derivative version. There's no accounting for taste, so to speak.) In any case, Crowley's ingenious device of mythicizing his image and making sure his literary executor (Job Symmons) was a passing acquaintance who loathed him precisely by reputation and would be quick to capitalize on his legend for a buck, has served to sustain his spirit in the public eye and by inference the whole background of his considerable Attainments. It's for this reason his books continue to be published long after much-less-difficult and demanding works, of far more \"popular\" aim, have plunged into obscurity; he has, like the proverbial Phoenix, given \"birth\" to his own Revival on innumerable occasions, as a newfound hero for the '60s conscious- ness-expansion wending his finely-tonsured way to the Sgt. Pepper album cover, most recently as the vilified subject of yellow-journalism again-having been singled-out by Gerald0 Rivera (who else?) on his lurid \"Devil-worshipper\" special as the \"man who brought Satanism into the 20th century\". Any hering reservation regarding Crowley's real greatness and the deserved recasting his image is about to receive in its definitive revival, should be dispelled for any intelligent Soul through simple recourse to his own words, through consulting his own considerable writings. One of the greatest essayists and finest poets of all time, his neglect in fbvor of lesser contemporaries can only be continued into the present by the kind of willful disregard or trepidatious \"disdain\" that characterized his initial detractors, and which-udortunately~ists in branding the operative psychological profiles of all-too-many modernists who would never confess themselves to be in the category of Witch-hunter General, and who in fact are often confused by their own tv.-era public as \"daring avant-gardists\". It's always amusing to see which \"light\", which respected luminary and liberal darling turns most quickly into the Iscariot or Torquemada he is in fact whenever the rare Real Article walks into the room. (Amazing the swiftness with which they actually volunteer their identity, as leaders of the lynch-'n'-burn party.) Up till now, much of Crowley's \"thought\" has been \"preserved\", albeit in aspic, by admiters, followers, imitators and even- we've seen-vehement detractors such as his own erstwhile biographer and \"literary executor\". Crowley's one-time secretary Israel Regardie, for example, has garnered the lion's share of attention and the greater part of praise for his Qabalistic exegeses and writings on Rosicrucianism etc., without anyone ever mentioning, or his publishers pointing up, the all-too-evident fact of his having built that reputation largely on what he piifered fiom Crowley! most often including large chunks of Crowley's own words (as did the insipid Symmons) without the decency of a single quotation-mark so that the \"best\" of much magical writing by renowned modem authors of the genre, has in-hidden4act been Crowley 's. (This of course is a ''trick of the trade\", most particularly the entertainment trade as plied \"out here in Hollywood\"; the more \"obscure\" work of the Greater-James Joyce characterized the type in Finnegans Wake as Shem the Penman-is taken advantage of by his \"evil twin\", the popularizing, distortively simplistic panderer Sham the Postman who always scavenges for material not likely to be in currency with the general public so as to pirate and present it just this side of plagiarism, as his screenwriter's-own, to the mogul who'll mount it for a 6-figure deal). Crowley was a hctionaryLerald, prophet, representative-of the Mahachohan (qv). It may be inferred, then, that one of the chief activities of the Mahachohan is disclosed through one of the chief preoccupations of Crowley's Magickal career, namely the redemptive integration of and resolution between Above and Below, the Spiritual and Material, through the representative"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV median and Embodiment of that Process personified as the Awakened Initiate, the Sonship of Horn (qv). This preoccupation and this indicator of the Office of Intelligent Activity (the Mother) is given prophetic expression and an ongoing Showcase in the Received spiritual text Liber A1 vel Legis, The Book of the Law (qv), dictated to Crowley in 1904 by an invisible \"disembodied Intelligence\" and emissaq of the Secret Chiefs identifying Himself as Aiwass (qv). Cosmic Awareness: What's that the little yapping dog has shown behind the curtain? Why, it's the Shade of Rudolf Steiner, and a whole Reading Room of quasi-christian scientists ... Density: From \"Channeling, UFOs, And The PositiveNegative Realms Beyond This WorldJJ4irst of all it's important to explain just what is meant by \"density\", since its use in this material is extremely helpful to our understanding once we clearly distinguish it fiom the common usage that allies it with tern of inertia and opacity synonymous with strictly physical existence. Although nowhere in the (Ra) material itself is the term \"density\" sufficiently explained so as to make that distinction, initiated intelligence would have you understand \"density\" in the sense of richness; the density of a manifesting plane or space is not a calculation of its inertia in this context, but to the contrary of its subtlety. It is easier to understand density as the degree of coherent activity, the characteristic \"accommodation\" of a given volume with respect to the perceiving system. The mathematical discipline of sphere-packing is helpful as a concept in grasping this definition. (How many oranges can be packed in a crate?) Sphere-packing employs the \"greedy algorithm\" in calculating a pure economy of space and is therefore a very practical help in communications, though it may theoretically work with an infinite number of dimensions. \"Density\" is analogous then to a multidimensional sphere-packing; the greater the density the more information a given volume codes, the greater the energy-value and richer the potential as which the space is coniigured. Like the discipline of sphere-packing, the idea of density implies a \"geometry of information\". For example we well know the \"law\" of 3rd density, our present collective plane of focus: \"no two objects can occupy the same space at the same time\". It should be obvious that this is a function of perception, for the operative coordinates of perception determine the outline of what's to stand as an object. According to 3rd density focal alignments, the descriptive units of \"objecthood\" are mutually exclusive and define one another by contrastive polarization. Perception of the essential coinherence of all mutually de£ining, polarized terms as an inextricable unity of complementary values, is a function of higherdensity cognition (or depends on the use of faculties belonging to the presently recessed planes and energy-systems of the higher densities). Thus when, in the course of spiritual discipline or occult practice performed through this plane we presently perceive a luminous wholeness and basic simultaneity that shines through all apparently separate objects (even though in the field of tangible perception such objects may persist in the perspectival \"relief' that makes them appear distinct) we are actually experiencing a mind-body alignment or momentary, harmonious coordination with energies and instruments belonging to other densities drawn into our fiame of reference. Hypostasis: The essence or sub-stance (that which supportively \"stands under\") anything--used in the Southern Crown context rather in the way Christianity employs the term to characterize the distinct Trinitarian subsistences in the indivisiblelunitive substance of Divinity. The \"christian\" take on the matter isn't far off in this instance (deriving as it does by long trade-route"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV fiom ancient zones of real gnosis); yet the character of the Hypostases needs to be understood fiom viewpoint of the traditional science once again, rather than by way of hierophantic hearsay and superstitious replacement-values. The Hypostases also have to be distinguished from the three Divine Qualities (see Mother Terasu essays) as they're not identities but correlates of one another. The Hypostases are Identity (Noesis), Mind and Psyche (see \"The Great Instauration Finis\"). The Qualities are Self; Love and Void. \"Self' correlates, by distributive correspondence of the multidimensional mind/body map or Logoic pattern, with Identity and Mind (or the Fa- therMother principles married within unity of the Divine Self, i.e. IChlDA or Crown). \"Love\" correlates with the PJychic Hypostasis, insofar as the latter is Mode of the Mirror whereby the experiential field reflects, in its polarities and complements, the primary Mectional Relationship between Consciousness-absolute and its own Creative Principle. \"Void\" has no corresponding Hypostasis. In one sense, it's a Quality belonging equally to all the Hypostases; and in another, it's the value linking and uniting the Hypostatic or conscious principles to the Creative field of un- and subconscious properties. Thus to the manifest or created patterns as a whole is ascribed the common denominator Void-value, hctioning primarily through and corresponding with the abdominal locus in the mind/body form. Liber A1 vel Legis, (The Book of the Law): Sacred text of the Mahachohan delivered to the poet Aleister Crowley by voice transmission on three successive afternoons in Cairo in 1904. The text itself is technically in English, its code is primarily that of the Hebrew Qabala, specifically the letter-number-Atu system characteristic of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn of which Crowley was an initiate, and from which his own subsequent Orders established a progression of the chief symbolisms/initiatory values for the oncoming Aeon of Horus (popularly, the Age of Aquarius). Secondary Qabalistic codes may be discovered in Greek and Farsi. \"This that thou writest is the threefold book of Law\" (verse 1 :35). There are three Personae in which the Book speaks (the formal communicant in the voice transmission being identified as \"Aiwass (qv), the Minister of Hoorpakraat\"): NUIT, Hadit and Ra Hoor Khuit There are three books to the Book of the Law, three Grades (Hermit, Lover, Man of Earth) and three \"ordeals\" etc. There are also three prophets to the Book of the Law, to maintain consistency with the rest, though this present word comes as a great Surprise to those familiar with the text since only two have thus far been identified (Crowley himself, and his \"magickal child\" or student-initiate Frater Achad). Since both are now \"dead\" (to the limited viewpoint) it appears all interpretation or understanding of the Book ceases abruptly with these two; indeed in order to insure against premature and thus misleading interpretation specific instruction is given in the Book and through Crowley's writings that all appeal to interpretation be left to Crowley's designated works alone, with the exception of Achad's origmal notation on those keys to the Book which he discovered (i.e. those few writings prior to the onset of his clinical insanity, a circumstance Crowley strove to intercept yet which, owing to the adept's strict honoring of the fiee will factor he could do nothing in the end to prevent since Achad finally fell to the signature hazard associated with the grade Magister Templi-4.e. he failed to take the counsel of precautionary measures in his swifl assumption of the Grade, for sake of the requisite Aerial perspective from which alone the obtaining of those initial Keys could helpfully be accomplished). owing to a certain inbuilt \"trickiness\" to the Liber AI text (subsequently explained herein), authorization of such exclusively sanctified source texts for overall interpretation was"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV greatly warranted, and in fact sealed with a kind of Curse against just those who, stretching the interpretation of such sanction itselfhave indeed subsequently sought to justify additional exposition or \"updating\" of the Lines of Liber A1 by virtue of their self-proclaimed and thus allegedly-permit- ting \"grades\". The \"acceptable\" dodge here, is of course that such commentators are only writing grade \"C\" material (this is not a classroom mark-in most cases!--but a formal category since Crowley himself proclaimed his own initiated exposition of the lines' meanings were of the B Class, only the actual text of Liber A1 and one more writing conforming to the definition of class A--or that primary material received strictly through Monaural Transmission of Aiwass Himself: that latter text indeed being The Comment wherein the Curse against unauthorized/ull~anctioned interpretation is first given). The Comment is as follows: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. The study of this Book is forbidden lt is wise to destroy ttus copy after the f im reading Whosoever disregards this does so at his own risk and peril These are most dire Those who discuss the contents of this Book are to be shunned by all as centers of pestilence. All questions of the Law are to be decided only by appeal to my writings each for him&. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt Love is the law, love under will Lines two and three are a characteristic trick and indeed identifag signature of the Mahachohan used throughout his successive historical incarnations (see me Mother Book). They are meant to have precisely the same effect as that ascribed to the deliberately loudkchoing report of the handgun in the Godfather employed to swe off \"pain-in-the-ass pedestrians\". It should be only too obvious the Book is meant to be studied, and intensely so 4e elaborate commentary by Crowley himself should seal the certainty of that. Such admonition, like the Godfather handgun, is meant to scare away all captious or trepidatious souls who \"shouldn't be there\", i.e. are of insufficient development to begin with and are either overtly or subtly/subconsciously poisoned with churchly pietism perennially falsifyin% everything truly spiritual so that any such text as A1 could only be perceived through thick distortion leading to Inquisitional abhorrence on the one hand or, by psychological reaction, to an unwarranted embrace of some \"Satanism\" as if sanctioned by the Holy Book itself (rather than by an infantile \"parental detestation\" etc.). This latter probability would only be underscored, in the case of such spiritual infancy or adolescence, since Crowley himself and many subsequent commentators such as Kenneth Grant have identified \"Aiwass\" with an ancient Sumerian deity (immortalized in me Exorcist!) and with the Peacock Lord of the Yazidi, Malak Ta 'us (qv)--the Yazidi have been accused of Devil Worship (but then, so has the Pope). Otherwise the Curse of The Commentary is meant to be taken in the strictest literalism, since even the most well-intentioned thelemic \"interpreters\" cannot write with the inspirational \"flame of Hadit\" burning in their hearts which alone secured the authority of Crowley's Pen. How then may we say there is a third and Final Prophet to the Book of the Law? when the prohibition against further Comment has been strictly given and the original two prophets are \"dead\"?

Therefore see The Mother Book for the full Exposition of those remaining \"unsolved\" locks and inbuilt puzzles of Liber Al, and know without further doubt Who has returned on behalf of the Whole. One more all-important reason there should be nofitrther appeal to any authority re Liber Al vel Legis other than to its Scribe (A.C.) and Its Author (Malak Ta'u, the Divine Aiwass): the \"trickiness\" of the Text itself involves consideration of the Level fiom which it emanates. Thanks largely to the Ra material and the works of Southern Crown we may have a more precise picture of both the Positive and the Negative spiritual hierarchies. We know fiom those sources that a precious few--ultimately One--of the Negative Hierarchy may attain so High as to a level corresponding to early 6th density; nor would this One be known by any of the remsining membership of the Negative Hierarchy since the characteristic of the Negative is to conceal and dissimulare (while that of the Positive hierarchy is on the contrary to Reveal and bare truth). The Negative comes in disguise, and no more so than Its Chief Hierophant, so that None amongst the Negative might know Him no matter what Orion or \"Reptilian\" might Peer to perceive. And, if we consult our Ra texts, we are dutifully informed that when the respective Hierarchies reach as High as 6th density level the Learnings, Understandings and Wisdoms between them tend very much to converge, and to be nearly Identical in many respects (this owing to the very value of Identity characterizing Considerations of 6th Density). Thus when, for example, such august pontiffs as the Marciniak ''Pleiadeans\" caution 3rd stage Earth-consciousness as to the undetectable trickiness of higher density sources with which terrestrials may be in communication--such as Themselves-we may know the Degree in the utter inability of 3rd-stage aspirants to discriminate correctly (relative to a 6th density Source-text such as Liber AI) when we realize the \"Pleiadeans\" are speaking largely about 4th density off-planet communicants! Since, therefore, the Knowing and \"pitch\" of Con- sciousness between, respectively, Negative and Positive hierarchies converge so dramatically toward Unity upon approaching 6th density, how much more impossible is it for any 3rd stage consciousness to detect the real difference between communications of the two? Yet such discrimi- nation is absolutely essential since, despite their similarities or even perfect Identities in Knowing, the respective Intents of positive and negative sources remain distinctly different and of critical importance. Again, the need for a reliable Guide here, preferably of the Incarnate type sharing your own fleshly estate, is manifestly essential. The deceptive and per$ectly dissimulating Nearness of sources from positive and negative hierarchies at the 6th density level is precisely the factor giving a text such as Liber Al its apparent sense of deep ambiguity: for on the one hand It's venerated by Magickal practitioners around the world, for the right or for the wrong reasons; and on the other It's hated and feared both by magical and metaphysical acolytes and by conventional seats of churchly pietism as the veritable Gospel of the Antichrist, the Word of the Prince of Darkness and the Mala Tamquam. Like a Compact Disc, depending how one holds it to the Light it seems to reflect different portions of the color-spectrum; thus Frater Achad, eager interpreter of the initial keys to Liber Al nonetheless fell to the instability of fancy at play in a Funhouse hall when his inadequate reinforcement of elementary Grounding (at his Grade-level) allowed him to tip the magickal mirror at a cockeyed angle, at which \"sinister\" potentials were reflected therefrom and magnified many times in his imbalanced imagination so that he became the first crazed declaimer against the Book to wear a Canadian straitjacket."},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Indeed, being the premiere Text of the Mahachohan and thus a legitimate expression of one of the theosophical Holy Offices (that of the Mother or Ruy of Intelligent Activity) the apparent \"ambiguity\" of Liber A1 necessarily serves thefirnction of the Mahachohan and the Mother, which is the chief reason why the text quotes the very Biblical saying: \"he that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that is filthy shall be filthy still\"--for, as explained in certain SOT-Bird essays of the Mahachohan, a chief function of the Mother/Mahachohan is to expedite and oversee polarization at the Harvest. Since by consensus of innumerable (disparate) sources this century's end is indeed the critical time of 3rd density Harvest, the chief concern of the Mother and Mahachohan is that of polarization amongst souls of 3rd density, and that whether positive or negative; polarization either to Positive or Negative hierarchy is valued by mankind's Guardians over the catastrophe of remaining unpolarized one way or another, for the latter eventuality-4- fortunately the Fate of the majority of this planet, if projected estimates prevail--necessitates the given sod's agonizing repetition of at least one whole 3rddensity cycle of incarnations. Thus, as it's been said, though the Mother and Mahachohan certainly teach and encourage only positive polarization they do not interfere in the sacred free choice of negative polarization, and in fact the keys they furnish may be used against Intention by negatively disposed Votive of Vicuii to (knowingly or unknowingly) intensify their own tendency toward threshold negative polarization thus expediting overall Harvest as well-in the same way that snake venom has positive/salvatory and negative/destructive uses, or just as knives handled intelligently and with proper caution may perform lifesaving surgery or in the absence of love/wisdom may make the quietus of some prince of peace.

It's for this reason it's said that the Ray of Intelligent Activity is of a \"higher point of development than the other two\". This is easily misundexstod, the key word is development. This word applies in the Logoic sense, i.e. \"development\" refers to the chikf Logoic aim of integrating and resolving the Spiritual with the material fields. Since it's the \"progress\" of the material fields which is in question (in the Formula) relative to the unfolding, potentiation and revealing of their qualities, it would be expected the Rays and corresponding Offices most intimately involved in the Manifestation would be most developed and charged with appropriate Knowledge in that sense. The Rays and wm- sponding Offices of Will and LoveWisdom (Manu and Bodhisattva), pertaining more exclusively to the Spiritual and innerlunmanifest phase of things, appear by virtue of that fact more convention- ally \"Holy\" in the accepted mauner and even \"higher\" in the misunderstood bbpurity\"or exclusivity of that orientation. As indicated elsewhere in SC writings, the Mahachohan is seldom identified by contemporaries as a holy or sacred manifestation in the way Manu and Bodhisattva are honored (albeit in practice largely ofer the fiict). The Mother herself is more often despised and even persecuted, for the historical and Logoic separations of the respective Offices have traditionally left a gap in understanding and appreciation even amongst representative embodiments of the mces themselves4ow much more so, then, amongst the major part of humanity constitutionally looking to those representatives for all their Spiritual cues! When it is said that the Mahachohan (and inferentially the Mother, only now for the first historical time in this Aeonic round fully embodied and Awake) learns hm the Bodhim and the Bodhisathra learns from the Manu, this may seem to conflict in the students' mind with the theosophical teaching that the Ray of Active Intelligence is at a more developed level than the other two. Yet resorting to our admonition to heed specific contextual meanings of the word \"developed\", we may understand how the MotherlMahnchohau learn hm the Bodhisattva in the sense that, being by mce closer and more deeply involved in the refktory physical plane of manifestation they necessarily need to refiesh their link with those office-holders less constitutionally corrrmitted to uncompromised manifestation (and who thus may dwell, at this intermediate Time of relative disjunction between the three vertical tiers of Being, in a state more proximal to Spirit even when technically incarnate so as to be less subject to lapse and spiritual forgedulness). Thus the Mother/Mahachohan \"learn\" hm the Heart-being of Love/W'iom, the Bodhisattva, because the Bodhisattva typically does not \"come down\" and embody so deeply into the field of manifestation thus retaining more perfectly intact his link with the pureiy spiritual fields. \"Le.\" hm the Bodhisattva, Mother and Mahachohan may be awakened and refieshed to the changeless spiritual principles corresponding to those Higher states where otherwise, being by commitment more deeply embodied and thus \"embedded\" in manifestation they might tend to flounder, without being caught up on the Fish's Line. However, being \"taught\" by the Bodhisattva (who in turn, remember, is linked by learning under the Manu Who's even Higher by exclusivist orientation in the Spiritual fields) the Mother and Mahachohan may uniquely opply their refieshed Remembrance of the Key Spiritual Principles to their own specialized and advanced understanding of the features particular to planes of materializing emanation.

All revolutionized the thought of their time; all gave a great impulse to the ability of man to interpret the laws of nature, and to understand the cosmic process, and only those of circumscribed vision will fail to recognize the unity of the many force impulses emanating from the one Lodge.\" Under the Ray of Intelligent Activity there are four subaltern Rays, likewise superin- tended by the Mother/Mahachohan. They are Ray IV, Ray of Harmony, Beauty and Art; Ray V, Ray of Concrete Knowledge or Science; Ray VI, Ray of Devotion or of Abstract Idealism; and Ray VII, the Ray of Ceremonial Magick or Order.

A Treatise on Cosmic Fire page 871 : \"Speakmg generally, therefore, it might be stated that egoic groups in whom the knowledge petals are being organized and unfolded come under the primary influence of the Mahachohan; those in whom the love aspect, or the second circle of petals, is opening come under the primary influence of the Bodhisattvq with the knowledge unfoldment paralleling the work; whilst those in whom the third tier is being opened come under the energy direction of the Many with the two other types of force co-ordinated. It will be apparent to the carefid reader that in this fact lies hid the secret of why the Mahachohan holds office longer than either of His two Brothers, holding it as He does for an entire world period. The key to these cycles lies hid in the following thoughts: the Bodhisattva and the Manu change more frequently and pass on to other work owing to the fact that They each embody one type of triple force, whereas the Mahachohan is the focal point for five types of energy, each in its tum triple in nature.\" A Treatise on Cosmic Fire, page 484: \"Within the department of the Mahachohan, a secondary division along these lines might be outlined: \"The seventh and fifth Rays are occupied with the return of the Son to the Father and are largely centred in pouring forth energizing power when it becomes necessary to transfer the life of the Son fiom an old fom into a new, from one kingdom of nature to another on the Path of Retum. \" The Mother is the transmutative Womb and Body through whom this \"transference of Fom\" takes place, as in the transition fiom 3rd to 4th densities occuning now, thus her Awakened Presence is called for, and duly received, peculiarly at this developmental juncture in order that the Process be expedited most directly.

Weekly Al-Capp-wannabe Charles Burn; and Emperor's Clothes motion picturehelevision auteur David Lynch--their singular insipidness and wholesale lack of talent separately, serving all-the- more-ingeniously to disguise their joint authorship (authorized over a joint) of the \"MT\" corpus. In modem times, to believe that a single person should have been responsible for so prodigious and far-ranging a feat of criticism, scholarship, philosophy, psychiclmetaphysical and spiritual attainment, to have produced at once such variety and depth of striking literary architectures and to have adorned their diverse walls with such innovative graphic, in murals of astonishing expression, to have solved (in person, practice and multi-media output) all outstanding problems of spirituality and science, every metaphysical and supracosmic conundrum, to have exhibited all the mastery of Magick ascribed to him in public displays defLing the denials of the loudest detractors and forcing either their sullen silence or mumbled admission while still being unable to get a good seat at Chasm's, has become equated with a quaint gullibility belonging to less educated epochs. Indeed, certain scholars are now inclined to believe, from evidence found in ruins of the Great L.A. Earthquake, that the \"person\" of \"MT\" may have had an historical basis in fact, but that claims as to his single authorship of all wonders attributed to him are naively precipitous, and unsupported by weight of the evidence embedded in surviving remnants of old Twin Peaks videos.

Thus the suggestion of embodiment given, by agent of the Office, to everything implied in the Logoic formula: also, the functional focus of that representation with special reference to the \"body\" or embodied/vehicu- larized being itself, in anticipation of the transformation and \"resurrection\" even of the \"lowest\" element in the Alchemical equation (for corpse in spiritual science and alchemy indicates the fleshly \"tomb\" for temporary occupancy of spirit; but also the potentially regenerable vessel for ''translat- ing\" the locus of spirit-concentration from one whole venue-of-expression to another without gap in the continuity of consciousness). Thus the \"formula\" of the MT always conceals either a hidden Yod (\"I\" or \"J\") indicating volition and the spiritized generative force, or Heh (\"H or \"E\"), the revivifLing \"spirit\" or breath-of-life itself. \"Corpse\" in and of itself is always reference to matter, the materia of the Mother, and is thus indicative, along with the secret vowel that animates it as a regenerative Name on the phylactery of the Magician-Qabalist, of the Ray of Intelligent Activity ascribed to the Akash of manifest being and the Office of the Mahachohan (\"Mother\" in the spiritual Triad). ~hiladel~hia Experiment (Rainbow Project): see Montauk (Phoenix) Project \"Pleiadeans\": Collective designation for a heterogeneity of \"channeled\" sources all of which, by the very employment of this particular term, display a common desire to ingratiate themselves with their audience as the \"good guys\".

The Meier Pleiadeans, in comp&son, appear better on first introduction-again, until you begin to read what they actually have to communicate to and through Meier, who isn't really a \"channel\" so much as an easy pickup ... Those of the readership boasting a faculty of assessment no more prodigious than that of \"common sense\", may find many a reason on that hnt alone to question either the veracity, intent, powers of translation or the simple intelligence of these flying Meier-onies; those with subtler facility in assessing the esoterica of such subjects as they profess to expound, are sure to have reason for rapid recourse to \"coitus interruptus\" with respect to these beguilingly-comely versions of the Pleiadeans Peracletus.

However, disregarding the Meier-Pleiadean disclaimer [since their whole veracityquotient is exactly what is in question to begin with], and assessing Bell's claim solely by comparison of the respective content-values in the presentations of each, we may reasonably side with Fred on this one and acknowledge a general similitude of quality hm source to source, suggesting that indeed there's more than one for whom They Toll-and how fortunate we all are, as beneficiaries of this badinage from both continents!) The Marciniak (qv) Pleiadeans or the Flying Fatuosi as they're affectionately known to Southern Crown, are in many respects the most eloquent of an ineloquent breed. Their \"rap\" is rather different fiom the others, and they strain it through a vocal wha-wha that does nothing if not bid for attention; nor do they seem particularly pernicious in any given area4ut they're hopelessly dysfunctional, rather as absurd as Meier's missionaries, when addressing the Natives as to how best to go around improving their backward and savage lot. We find for example that, as exponents of the \"You Create Your Own Reality\" canard (qv. YCYOR, not \"canard\") they enwrap their enraptured audience with exactly the rap we've all been waiting to hear: \"If it looks like it is too much work, something is telling you it is not the way.\" Bringers of the Dawn, p. 122.

Prana: geometrized energy-patterns coded into and informing the etheric-physical field, the astral-etheric field, the astral and mental fields etc. \"Prana\" is the generic Hindu term, used here in preference of others owing to its familiarity even in the West, corresponding roughly to what has otherwise been known as vril, orgone, wakkan, odor odic force, moth, subtle energy and magnetic fluid; depending on the given plane, state or density in which the pram occurs, it may take on various forms and serve differing functions according to ideotypal, psychic, psycho-emotional or vital requirements. It is not the same as the ether but encodes infbtructure patterns of ether, which, according to \"angle-of-propagation\" and overall waveform of the latter tend to align, organize and preferentially orient the geometric sub-components of enfolded prana-states (thus exfolding them with reference to the guiding ideotype of the cognitive grid network imparting etheric \"angle\" in the first place). Through the resultant guideline of perspectival coordinates they \"migrate\" to strategic ontological \"positions\" undergirding stress-tensor states of subatomic field patterns and magnetogravitic, phase-space topologies. Suchpranic idktmctures are themselves without \"size\" or \"physical\" position (i.e. with respect to atomic coordinates to the limits of indeterminacy) though their ontological \"angles\" and \"edges\" orient relative size and respective position of point-fields by gauge adjustments according to compensatory symmetries required of the-given-perspective. The prank patterns themselves are reiterative and holonomic. Therefore while they may \"appear\" to reside strictly \"within\" the coordinative limits of the overall field geometry (as with E8 x E8 gauge groups) either when evidentially reconstituted or occultly \"perceived\", they are arbitrarily \"expansive\" to an indeterminate degree and range beyond those apparent micro-boundaries.

Her account of the process by which the LL Research group conducted the \"Ra workings\" (in Channeler 's Handbook, see MT review of same) should be used as a standard with which to evaluate the quotient of occult care surrounding every other instance of channeling. In comparison one will find virtually all other channelings-with exception of Roberts' Seth material-40 have been conducted under conditions no better than for those of turn-of-the-century seance or tabletapping, and to have been undertaken initially under no less frivolous inspiration (see the hilarious account of J.Z. Knight's \"epiphany\" that kicked off the \"Ramtha\" channelings; this furnishes a yardstick for fatuity as sublime in its way as the Ra \"workings\" are models of meritoriousness).

All \"new age\" knowledge of the Negative hierarchy owes its (largely unacknowledged) debt to this single Source; and aside from private (student-initiate) Southern Crown material predating publication of the Ra workings, no authentic Word or initiated insight into such themes has substantially dented the virgin seal of new age souls too delicate in dreams-of-light ever to conceive such unpleasantness on their own. As tangible result of the subtle (and indeed, perilous) character clinging to Events in the Ra channeling, Carla's health and even life has remained continuously in jeopardy.

(Lest anyone suppose this observation lists to the left of \"personal interpretation\", it's co-signed by Carla herself with reference to the very title of a non-channeled book early issued by LL Research, i.e. The Crucifixion of Esmeralda Sweetwater.) Indeed so moribund and \"ma.\" did her condition become at one point in the late '80s that MT, actually fearing for her life, undertook a radical long-distance initiatory therapy in which, by subjecting Carla to an uninterrupted stream of abuse, ridicule, mockery and denigration, he sought to shock her out of her all-but-imperceptible fading-away, in ignition of her latently-righteous indignation thereby driving the squatters-rights demons straight out of her. And, since \"God-hath-no-fby\" like a sweet Southern Belle who believes her honor's been besmirched, Carla reports she's feeling better now. Southern Crown: Official name of Initiatory GroupMystery School of which AAA/MT are the presiding Adepti. The name derives fiom the constellation Corona Australis (Sudliche Krone) located near the Archer's waist on the Milky Way's edge. The constellation name seems to come fiom a reference of Germanicus in Phainomena where he speaks of the Corona sine honore, a comparison to the Northern Crown having a contrastively great tradition behind it. Gratius adds that ancient authors knew it as the Centaur's Crown (centaurs having been depicted as wearing starry crowns). Classic poets refer to it as Bacchw ' Crown, lyricking the RevelerIRevealer had thrust it into the heavens on behalf of Semele, his Mother. Owing to its radiatory configuration, it's often associated with the Bunch of Arrows emanating fiom the Archer's hand; in this connection it suggests a wheel, and therefore is also known as Rota Ixionis (hion was associated with the centaur Pholos). The Arabs knew it as A1 Kubbah, literally \"the Tortoise\" (by which it's also known to the Chinese) but with a secondary meaning of Woman's Tent or \"traveling apartment\"; thus it is A1 Hiba, the Tent, and A1 Udha a1 Na 'am, the Ostrich 's Nest (referring to what's now the nearby Eagle). It is also A1 Fakkah, The Dish. For the significance of \"Tortoise\" etc. see The Mother Book. The reference to the Mother in \"Semele\" and the \"Woman's Tent\" is plain. Also this \"tent\", being a \"traveling apartment\", irresistibly suggests a motel; MT is an acceptable abbreviation for Motel,"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV which latter fkquently sport \"the best\" or AAA rating. MT was born in San Luis Obispo, birthplace of the motel. The Nest/Eagle association is plainly appropriate to the Order's symbolism as origin of the Mother-current The Name particularly suits the initiatory order of Southern Crown since it's less conspicuous than its \"Northern counterpart\" (\"without honor\", i.e. largely uncelebrated), yet it's assigned 49 stars (7x7) thus far outnumbering those attributed to Corona Borealis. Its association with Sagittarius is apt, since the Order of Southern Crown was founded exactly a year to the day before the planetoid Chiron was discovered; in that earlier year and on that day MT received a single, distinct Inner verbal communication enunciating the very name Chiron. Researching it, the first mention of Chiron he encountered was in a book by Jung, where the spelling was rendered Chieron; (it's seldom if ever rendered this way, as he subsequently found). Doing a Greek Qabala on the name based on the above spelling, he arrived at a particular fonnula which is also the exact number of the visible subdivisions or \"tiles\" on the Cube Cephas. On this Magickal Formula, the Order of southern Crown was founded. Spacetimflimespace (excerpted fiom \"Channeling, UFOs and the PositivelNegative Realms Beyond This World\", Through the Looking Glass, the Time/Space of Our SpaceITime): ... it's necessary to note the distinction which Ra makes between the orders of spacdtime and of timeace (all the densities from Ra's Perspective downward are organized in these complementary ways). Although the Ra material doesn't detail the significance of these organizations beyond certain preliminary points, they are cited as categories of consideration because of what they necessarily imply. We may understand \"space/time\", first of all, in the terms we're familiar with. We occupy the system of our spacehime as a vehicle, (or axial, mind-body locus) through which the coordinates of that system necessarily arrange all features according to the requirements of situationality. We're located, vehicularly, at and as a particular juncture of time and space, so that values of \"near\" and \"far\" acquire functional importance. In this context, our limitations are our opportunities; what's filtered through the bottleneck of spaceltirne becomes the focus of our concern, and the material of our resourcefulness in operating through finitizing faculties. Because our . - condition is one of centrist perspective and therefore discnrmnative navigation, the order of spacehime comprises the context in which progress is possible through situational doing. We learn by acting through defining conditions, from which an order of consequence develops whereby to gauge all Adjustment. We may have heard that at death the limits of the localized body dissolve, and we move through a lighter material into conjunction with a display of space and time that's comparatively plastic. It's here t. in the unity of a presiding Light, we may review all the features belonging to our personal past without regard for the usual measure of sequence, or apportionment of priorities. Everything appears equally available, in the manner of a deck of cards fanned out in panoramic display or as simultaneous images shining in a reflective flotilla of bubbles. Here there is no \"rootedness\" at an enclosing, defining spacehime juncture similar to that which was experienced in physical life. The \"vehicle\" (or axial locus) of the mind-body being which may be identified as operating in the new state, gives no impression of imploding on a contained self-sense but rather has more the feeling of an acceleration constantly surpassing itself, expanding through Space of starry nerve-clusters in a range embracing the soul-record to the finest part of the life last lived. This"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV is the complementary field of time/space belonging to the inner planes of 3rd density existence. The ticks of time are indeed spatially exhibited, in a kind of interior hall-of-records where a life-review may be conducted and all the \"masked\" elements unveiled for a kind of global consideration. This is an interval in the pattern of soul-progression, usually conducted as a kind of protracted sleep-and-dreamstate wherein experience may be assimilated, distilled, and the various steps of \"dissociation\" rehearsed whereby the heart is ferried-on the implacable subconscious current--through the underworld ordeal of a purifying dis-identification from every attachment and lingering fixation of form---sumxning in the Amenta of the psyche's recuperative rest what must eventually take place as a volitio~l work of conscious understanding in the context of spaceltime limit. This timeispace framework of the inner planes is inferentially sealed up, self-enclosed for purposes of such soulexamination; for here the most important determinations must be made as to what the soul has within it, and this process necessarily goes on without disturbance. Such a state is a kind of clearinghouse for the assignation of souls, each according to the quality distilled in the process of \"becoming\" the sum-total of what, viewed in the complementary spacehime fi-ame, is spread out piecemeal as a sequentially shifting pattern. From this timelspace antechamber, where the soul aligns progressively with the non-local character of compositional coordinates subtending all \"local\" clusters of physical existence, the distillate of psychic focus comprising the latent personalityexpression may be transferred to the space/tme fi-amework most consistent with its net value; these worlds of space/time organization may indeed, beyond the admixed education of 3rd density, polarize to the emphatically positive or decisively negative. The complementary timelspace fi-ameworks of the \"inner planes\" of each succeeding density, function very much on the same principle of review, analysis, attunemenf adjustment according to sum-volitional inclination, and further assignment of space/time fields in which the relative \"localization\" of vehicularized consciousness furnishes conditions of real, developmental furtherance and learning. The \"division\" between the contractile, selfenfolded spacehime vehicle and its expan- sive (self-surpassing) timeispace counterpart seems much more solidlimpermeable in 3rd density fi-amework owing to the general screeningdevice of that realm, in which the interior order of things is specifically rotated at mutually filtering angles to the physical field of expression. It's for this reason there's no direct knowledge of or recognition re an \"afterlife\", for the most part, at the 3rd stage level of consciousness-4 such matters being confined to speculation, rumor and culturally modified myth. In the higher densities the \"division\" between given spaceltime and timelspace organizations at each level is less severe; there's apenneabilizy between the two orders in the higher densities, greater or lesser depending on refinement of the density. Each higher density has a space/time fi-amework wherein the soul \"contractually\" aligns with a nest of embodying vehicles, through which the compound focal patterns of specific level-identification produce an incarnating eversion of the currents organizing the locus of cross- correlation and perceptual synthesis. This \"invagination\" of participating planes of the current-field (through ideoform lockin of the focal-coordinate line) fixes the streams of multidimensionaVpat- terning geometries into a stabilizing structural hold, concentrating a coherent convergence of spaceltime \"points\" so as to formulate a real position of true situationality ."},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The process is much the same throughout the densities. The extreme turning-inside-out comprising the physical 3rddensity fkme of focus is represented in familiar terms by the polarized lockin of kundalini, the energy-coils of which seem to settle the multidimensional twists of composing current-fields in inverse order of descent around each other; this in effect nucleates the subtle, radiant-psychic ethers rdecting the given (operative) Typologies so that mind and idea seem to occupy a position of faint interiority with respect to the fixed \"physical\" envelope of structural consistency and inertial repetition, into which those psychic coordinates are aligned. In the condition of 4th density, such incamative focal lockin formulates a functional specification of time and place in the same general manner, producing a kind of ''materialization\" of the Astral field into a similar situational centrism. There exists the same type of vehicular contingency which makes \"travel\" in the Astral 4th density fields of spaceltime a matter of actual space ships (albeit of the biomechanical type described in last month's issue, consistent with the psychic level at which materia is generally organized in such a fhmework); whereas we're familiar, if only by hearsay, with the flotational mode whollyfiee of any mechanical-vehicular requirement in the context of Astral or inner-plane, 3rd density time/'ace frameworks. This accounts for the apparent discrepancy, i.e. the difference between what we hear in tenns of the bbRobert Monroe\" style of inner-plane astral travel conducted strictly in the soul vehicle, and those reports of astral-like entities certainly functioning fiom the plane of a \"psychic\" milieu nonetheless requiring physi- cdmechanical vehicles of some type to convey them hm place to place: the non-mechanical flights of astral transport through unencumbered agency of the soul vehicle in general belong to orders of timd'ce, which have a specific and very different function hm spaceltime in any given density; conversely, those modes of travel through astral, astral-etheric or etheric-physical fields manSestly requiring a kind of mechanical or \"hardware\" vehicle, belong to spacehime orders of organization. Either type of vehicle, proceedmg from spaceltime or timdspace ~eworks, may intrude upon familiar spacehime physical reality. In the higher densities the fhmeworks of spaceltime and timdspace are equally discrete, since they serve separate purposes; yet the more translucent modes of organization belonging to those densities allow a permeability which makes the fields and informing patterns of timelspace more readily accessible to the vehicularized \"localism of incarnative, space/time agency. Thus to 4th density \"embodied\" entities, the whole history of a life-system is akashically available even though in practical terms they're functioning at a particular cross-section in the span of that history. Similarly, in 5th density the totality of cosmic patterns comprising the infrastructure of all times and places is theoretically available, even though the \"incamative\" pattern of the particular spaceltime agent functions fiom the perspective of a situational locus immediately responsive to certain worlds, spaceltime fiames and patterns. In every case, the juncture of ''meeting\" between the Positive and Negative realms andlor the Positive and Negative Beings is generally reserved for the space/time frsMeworks of any given density, since the timelspace frames (serving another function) are largely self-sealed as the soul's \"isolation-tank\", where it may take stock-* it were--of the potential moves of further progress through its chosen polarity. This accounts for some of the channeled information we receive to the effect that the Negative is just a chimera, a \"projection of our own subconscious fears and primal doubts\" etc.; the other sources of such information are Negative propaganda, proceeding from the Negative planes themselves."},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Valerian, Val: Gargantuan-like editorlauthor for the alternative-information periodical Leading Edge, the groundbreaking Matrix volumes etc. In the year of Our Lord '93, said to have suffered mightily under Pun-tious Pilate, was crucified by the Mahachohan on the Mount of Microprosopus (called Yhe Impatient Face\"), and Arose in 12 months carrying in tact the Sacred Tablets of Malak Ta'us (qv). One Gospel account claims that on this Occasion he was heard to mutter beneath his breath: \"Nevermore; I swear, nevermore\". \"You Create Your Own Reality\": Tertiary distortion of the Free-will factor in the Law of Confusion (see Ra material)-characteristic expression and philosophical promulgation of a certain life-wave type, having no single group composition but a general membership-identity across various star-fields, galaxies, planes, dimensions, densities and degrees of space and time; does not indicate \"positive\" or \"negative\" identity of the communicant giving rise to the expression in any given case. YCYOR has become the provisional new age shibboleth, owing to the extent to which extradimensional and celestial intelligences committed to its ideals and implications have concen- trated a collective focus into this zone of the spacetime continuum during Earth-transition to 4th density. Understanding the reason for such \"synchronous\" convergence of emissaries with emphasis on this particular type hm far-flung regions both of space and time, depends on an understanding of the spiriruaI time axis (see essay III of T-Bird Meets The Phoenix). Along the spiritual time axis, coordination is evinced not in linear-mechanical terms of uniform clock-meas- urement but in qualitative congruencies of comparative states. Thus we may envision a multidi- mensional universe of \"wheels within wheels\", that is cycles within Cycles, and though a given epicycle may be merely a minute fiaction of the parent Cycle in term of temporal \"duration\" on the quantitative plane, the only factor of significance on the qualitative axis of spiritual development is the respective stage in the mtating parallelisms of the cycles. Therefore, that which makes two \"moments\" in space and time compatible in terms of communication and intercourse isn't their \"physical propinquity\" (a very relative and plastic measure) but coincidence in cycles. Regardless, then, whether an extra-galactic civilization is aeons in our \"past\" or light years in our \"future\" judged by \"local\" laws of the lightcone, its availability to us (and us to it) depends on the stage or degree of cycle through which each is respectively passing. The transition stage between 4th and 5th densities taking place in an extragalactic civilization comparatively in our \"future\", is much more \"propinquitous\" or smoothly adjacent to our present state and condition-of-being since by synchrony we're passing through a connate phase of our own \"lesser\" cycle, i.e. passing between 3rd and 4th density. It's therefore the synchrony in cyclic time which sees these otherwise farflung civilizations and emissaries of \"remote\" galactic regions right at our doorstep, all+pparently--so \"suddenly\" interested in us and what \"we\" as a planetary populace are up to, as if boatloads from virtually every country around the world were suddenly to appear on U.S. shores without prior conference, spontaneously \"interested\" hm each individual angle in what those wild Americans were doing. Thus the general strength or comparative constitutional \"titre\" of those beings bearing standards of YCYOR converging upon this Transitional time and place, is attributable to the common circumstance that each is at the \"moment\" of his own transitional phase and finds something of mutual interest (relative to his own respective transit) at this 3rd-density Earth locus."},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV (We therefore needn't presume some strange \"simultaneity\" of behaviors on the part of virtually every being in the spacetime spectrum; as with Einsteinian physics in the \"local\" case, \"simulta- neity\" is a relative concept depending on the coordinative framework. In this case the coordinate framework doesn't depend on the quantitative propagation of lightsignals, but rather on the congruency or typal harmony of phase. Thus each planetary or star-being whom we may find \"presently\" converging, by some simultaneity of impulse, upon our planetary doorstep, has in his own framework passed through a measure of \"time\" perfectly indigenous to native requirements for which any other framework would be comparatively remote and confined to its own concerns; each in his own \"temporal\" context eventually arrives at a transition state between the present density-of-being and the next.'This transition-state itself is the factor automatically coupling him by resonant synchrony to that connate phase in the respective cycles through which all other entities [regardless spacetime location or density-degree] must pass. It's not necessary to contemplate some fantastic \"acceleration\" or \"slowing up\" of respective cycles to get them to coincide or \"agree\" with one particular framework such as \"ours\"; each coincides perfectly, by virtue of commonality or similitude of phase, regardless how \"long\" or \"short\" the respective times each endured toward the transitional moment.) This explained, we may understand the presence of a peculiar preponderance of professed \"reality creators\" at our doorstep as function of this qualitative congruence. Since the operative factor is qualitative, we must ask what psychic correspondence exists between our consciousness-type and the type drawn to us, that so many should find their phasic jump to the next-highest density somehow concerned with a factor to be found here, at the lowest density-tran- sition belonging to self-reflective consciousness altogether, and technically behind them-4.e. in their relative \"past\"-while at the same time \"coincidentally\" brandishing the same philosophical Flag regardless the \"positive\" or \"negative\" background, the spatioternporal distances separating them, the \"current\" density level respectively occupied etc. Indeed, contemplating this single question gives the game away. Why all such \"civili- zations\" or social/memory/complexes would beam au rebours toward us in concentrated tutelage while ostensibly seeking a forward advance upon their own next-highest density, is easily under- stood in noting that any such \"higher density\" beings must necessarily be--in some sense--our \"own\" future selves, or probable versions of what \"we\" are careering toward becoming. They \"return\" to us in absorptive contemplation at the brink of their own phasic transition, much in the way we study our own psychic background and key episodes in our past (on the \"psychiatric couch\" or otherwise) when assaying a forward move out of a current psychological impasse. This infes that all such beings are in some way at a psychological (i-e. mind/body) impasse, and are \"returning\" here to 3rd density and our transition-point as by compulsion. Just as those who obsessively brood over their past (in the implicit hopes of \"breaking through\" the blockage felt to have formed there) tend to bring with them on that psychic forage all the same bag and baggage originally packed \"back then\" and lugged thereafter, so the \"spacebrothers\" and entities from farflung \"futures\" of higher density life return to this their \"past\" 3rddensity juncture--literally or by satisfactory correspon- dence-inevitably bearing the load of what burdens their own pending transition; and they bring it with them in much the same way the psychological self-examiner obsessively clings to the a posteriori impactions he's determined to undo. Just as the psychiatric patient is grossly ident@ed with the very features undergirding his neurosis. so the backtracking spacebeings are grossly identified with the props supporting their own problems of transition. Indeed just as the subcon-"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV sciousness of those continuing knots in the psychiatric case supply the type of difficulty confronted by 3rd-stage psyche in its desire to progress and transcend, so the necessary consciousness of the concepts germane to the higher-density states furnishes a resistance-factor enormous in its own way for those seeking synchronous progress on the suceding turn of the cosmic cycle. The degree of self-conscious consolidation as which such entities have introjected--and lived by--the philosophic formulation summed in YCYOR, imparts its own quality of persuasion only secured all-the-more owing to the extent to which it preempts the value of Identity. It has to be understood that, emanating fiom higherdimensional consciousness some such statement as YCYOR isn't just a theory to be tested or applied; it's a proclamation of Who ney Are. Such proclamation carries psychic weight, owing to the fact that its relative ''truth value\" is formulated at densities-of-being bearing some necessarily-direct relation to essential cosmic principles and values. This is indeed why we insist, in our various critiques of YCYOR (see Bashar Book Review etc.) that the implicit if subliminal \"appeal\" of such a shibboleth has to do with its emanation fiom some tangent-to-Being forming more acute angle to the Conscious Axis than that ordinarily styled at the 3rd-stage level. Its original forging in more focused Light of Consciousness gives it a \"quasi-validity\", apparently accounting for and co-opting the assistance of certain essential principlessf-being-up to a point. It is of course that limiting \"point\" which has been reached, by the forms of consciousness hm which we hear and who strain to link the sum momentum of our motion to their own. As with the tenacity of the ordinary psychic complex, then, the collective \"effort\" of the spacebeings (regardless individual motives or orientations) is that of bringing to bear all the force of the problematic conclusion itself upon those \"past\" events having given rise to it in the first place, as if to persuade such events to take their formative point of departure more seriody at the outset-indeed to furnish the participants in such events a less ambiguous, more forcefully- formulated and emphatic model to begin with so as to \"cut to the chase\", delete the amount of time \"originally\" required to consolidate the position and so streamline its entry into the 4thdensity phase, thus inferentially imparting that much more momentum of initial consolidation to their own coupled phasetransition (i-e. to 5th as in the Sassani case, 5th and 6th in the case of the Pleiadeans etc.). We may now see why they aU apparently come \"here\" (i.e. why there's such a preponderant proportion in the representation of YCYOR to the face of this plane, a circumstance which is naively taken to bespeak the authenticity of the idea itself--as if mere \"consensus\" in the higherdensity frameworks were any more reason to embrace some notion than it is here). This preponderant proportion of YCYOR proponents is precisely a mirroring effect demonstrating the halftruth or \"quasi-validity\" of the principle itself. If it's a mirroring effect, this obviously means we're having mirrored back to us, in amplified and developed form, some seed-tendency we're \"presently\" manifesting. These beings and their ideas are reflections of what \"we\" might become, a probable version or versions of some nascent direction we're collectively imparting to our current momentum. By the same token, the fact we may now clearly iden@ the problematic character of the \"inspiration\" bringing them collectively here fiom their respective backgrounds, shows us why this mirroring effect is only manifestation of a halftruth, not the exemplification of its ultimate superiority. While it's true they mirror some present tendency of ours and were attracted here for precisely that reason, it's also evident they manifest such \"tendency\" to us hm an Angle that suffers some dejiciency. (The Pleiadeans of Marciniak proclaim they're here precisely to try to"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV change the \"future\" fiom which they come wherein they're renegades to a totalitarian empire; the Sassani of \"Bashar\" overtly try to induce us to endure our spacealien abduction by their grey cousins, and even to like it, for the implicit purpose of promoting their own density-maximization as \"future\" products of the cross-breed.) Therefore it's only-too-apparent they don 't come from a \"reality they've created\", to show us how to do likewise. Marciniak's Reality Creating Pleiadeans are manifestly bracketed by a reality that's excruciating to them. Rather, they come fiom \"realities\" that are provisional models of the presupposition YCYOR, wherein the projected patterns of ''their own\" desideration are necessarily reflected, compared, weighed, evaluated, balanced against and ruled upon by the Whole-being Standard of Reality. (For extensive discussion of these ideas see Bashar review, Motto in the Lotto and The Big Spin.) Why are they attracted here, then? Precisely because, as a collective tendency of consciousness we've already got a \"start\" on the ego-model of \"personal reality creation\". We're already implicitly-presumed little reality creators in the solipsistic sanctuaries of our brains. That is nothing more than the overt articulation of the tacit, working \"scientific\" hypothesis of our day. Our own unexamined presumptions are just embedded and \"writ large\" in the presump- tions undergirding YCYOR-for the question which such an hypothesis really asks of itself (against its Whole-being Ground) as it declares its validity is: \"Who is this 'You ' \" and \"Your \"? The \"you\" that \"creates\" by doing, acting, performing etc., is manifestly a constituted agent; \"you\" arises precisely through and in expression of the coordinative qualities triangulating the given, variable-pattern instrument as which will is enabled to modulate its focus, and so impart particular emphasis. The question circling around the fk-will variable has to do with emphasis, not arbitrary latitude. First of all we must understand theprinciple of this \"freedom\" within \"will\", otherwise the most nescient new ager arguing \"arbitrary latitude\" in flagrant disdain of any personal examination of the themes involved, is vulnerable to the first obvious blow to the conventions of the premise (having never occurred to him, of course, previous to his own ingenuous pmoting). Will isn't lke because it \"arises in a vacuum without innate values\"; even should will arise in a vacuum (i.e. the Buddhist nibbana, the vaunted state of void-mind etc.) that vacuum isn't without implicit values setting conditions to the states in which any \"prerogative\" may manifest. It is the pre-existence of such values even down to the irreducible vacuum, which secures the very quality identifiable as \"freedom of will\" and at the same time gives us the only set of operative qualifications under which \"freedom\" is at all meaningful. The easiest way to understand it, is in contemplation of an area of blank page. Label it \"vacuum\". Make a line (a line is the minimal indication of the principle of Will, since it establishes emphasis by both presence and directionality [inclination or axial orientation]). Since this \"line\" occurs on the background \"vacuum\" of the page, we have no right to ascribe static values to its angle of orientation. The blankness of the vacuum gives us no external reference, no orienting coordinates of \"longitude\" and \"latitude\" etc. We may rotate the page 360°, and our arbitrarily- deposited line will obligingly rotate through every angle to its initial position. It will, in other words, out of its single stroke generate a theoretically inexhaustible set of radii inscribing the plane of a complete circle."},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Since the lengths of \"the line\" can be extended infinitely, we may say this is a circle - - having a circderence which is nowhere. The common \"point\" around which the line was necessarily rotated, has no specific \"place\" at which it acquires independent reality as a particular \"size\" or specific location etc. Thus it is \"everywhere\". (This is why, geometrically, the point is non-dimensional--the locus at which the radii thetically converge form an abstract or \"ideal\" point which may be regressed to the ''infinitely small\" without being definitively determined. Point is irreducible in the sense of an ontologicalpresence without extensionality, not in the sense of having specific dimension, size or position.) Let's assume the vacuum through which these states inexorably arise, is the equivalent of consciousness (in the West spiritual sense of that illimitable Totality which enjoys such perfect consistency and self-continuity with itselfin uninterrupted congruence with its own wholeness that it is, ipso facto, aware of itseyas such whole-continuity, thus securing its unqualified selfangru- ence by that very corning-to-itself). This \"vacuum\" or Void which is consciousness-absolute may be considered the total absence of all conditions or the total presence of all conditions. In either case no parti&lar is differentiated, thus conserving its voidness. The positing of any particular within its all-permissive potential, generates the complementarity-symmetry of mutual inversions organized maround the holohedral features of any such p-&ticular, this is what's meant by the \"implicit values setting conditions to the states in which any 'prerogative' may manSest\". Note that such conditions don't place a &lification upon consciousness; their sum is still zero (i-e. they share a mutual convergence-locus or common denominator at the--indetermi- nate-void-point juncture, where every qualification is cancelled of its individual emphasis while consenting characteristics of its comparative presence in angular aspect with all else). Consciousness is conserved as the all-accommodating presence through which &ch radial distributions of \"coor- dinative trajectories\" are enabled, aqd may be \"located\" in terms of the superposed circular pattern either at the infinite extreme of expansion or contraction, i.e. as the transcendent factor of infinite radial extension or the zero-sum factor of infinite mutual convergence. Both are implied and required by the Void-totality of consciousness-absolute. The qualieing radial extensions, theoretically of infinite \"density\" in the subtle grada- tion fiom one to the other, may be considered modulations of the qualities (Gunam, in Sanskrit terminology). It is through variable coordinative alignments and filtrate organizations in the angular relationships of \"diameter\" and \"radii\" with respect to an ideallydelineated \"circderence\", that the pmep&l grid-networks ''screening\" any given universe of coinvolved/highlight qualities are drawn intofunctional relief: The answer as to how this \"miracle of creation\" is accomplished in consciousness, when consciousness in itself is definitionally so W and complete as to be unequat- able with delimiting instruments, is given in the coincident location suggested above between the convergence locus or common denominator of all radii of the \"qualities\", and the conserved - void-presence indicative of Consciousness. Consciousness, \"enable-d\" to appear across its own . potential qualities through the void-point locus connate by \"value\" with its own nature, takes the form of Will. Will, as the Hadit-point, \"fits\" consciousness as it were through the void-locus, into specific congruence with the lineaform extensions comprising its plenum of manifestable potential. Slipping consciousness into congruent alignment with its extensible qualities through the common- denominator locus, the Hadit-point may function as central instrument of a variable modulation emphasis, since all lines lead mutually to it."},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Thus consciousness \"translates\" in terms of the pattern, as Wil. It employs the agency of those saturate extensions, through coincidence with their commondenominator locus, in stress- ing selective \"keys\" simultaneously raising while comparatively lowering overlapping qualities in relative relief and recess thus modulating the operative interaction of states to a complex identip- profile. Will sets up waves in the (equipotential) Symmetry of the potentiating pattern; it plays these variable flu-states like piano keys, generating harmonics of ripple, repercussion and resonance-in- terference conforming to the \"score\" written as ideotype for a particular perceptual grid. Will's operation is therefore that of emphasis, not arbitrary latitude. The \"qualities\" resident in the combinative potential derived from infinite density-gra- dation between djacent radii (distributed through the Circle) possess thereby a kind of eternal pre-existence, owing to the AU-accommodation of Absolute-being. They're drawn into relief, or comparatively recessed, so as to generate, reinforce or modify the cognitive grid giving form to any world. Even so, one could presume an arbitrary latitude of emphasis owing to the thetic infinity of gradation, if the resultant qualities could number \"meaning\" among their synthetic attributes (i-e. if \"sweetness of personality\" oozed out of a chocolate candybar along with its characteristic flavor, or \"furtive rottenness of soul\" came attached like captions in a silent-movie morality play when biting into a wormy apple). Our theoretical \"reality creatoryy could then exercise a mly imperious and absolute power; \"meaning\", that which ultimately imparts the significance for any world, state or form of consciousness thereby giving the Rule both in principle and Person (i.e. answering specificah) \"Who\" and \"What\" is at the bottom of it all), would be placed entireiy in the hands of an independent intelligence of purely arbitrary decision and latitude, whether we call it \"latitude of choice\"-+ in \"productivity ex nihilo\"--or \"latitude of emphasis\" as in \"infinite smorgasbord\". Intelligence could--& effect-wallc around the circle of infinitely-graded radii and pull out \"meaning\" from the categorical slot of any potential quality, and never have to return to starting point. The circle of radii with their potential combinative qualities would never \"circumscribe\" such an intelligence, or ever give thought to limit since any given \"entry\" into the potential of a radius would constitute an inexhaustible tangent for exploitation. Like an eternal infant, the \"reality creator\" could get lost in the nursery of any given entrance-point to the elementa of radii, picking one after another \"meaning\" along with the quality to which whim might be attracted in order to Authorize another universe. If \"meanings\" inhered by one-to-one equivalency in the qualities (represented by the graduated radii), \"meaning\" would be a species in the sets-of-opposites along with color, sound, shape, dimension etc., and the assumption of \"reality creators\" would be justified: \"meanings\" could only be charged with equal and opposite values that were equivalently arbitrary, and mutually negating. \"You\" could then \"create\" by consciously deciding what meaning you wished to pull out of the plenum of meanings, assigning just that value as interpretivefiat of the whole. \"You\" could decide to live in a world with oranges but not apples. If the elemental ratios constituting \"oranges\" gave rise in themselves to a property called happiness, and the meaning sorrow derived from the elemental ratios composing \"apples\", this kind of garden-weeding version of Reality Creating would be viable; and, as absurd as it sounds stated this way, this is precisely the kind of cognitive error made frequently in any case, as when efforts are made to scourge and \"purify\" the race through Eugenics, or exterminate a whole people so as to delete \"vice\" from the world. Yet we don't feel the utter arbitrariness of the meanings which experience seems to engender. We can't pull them out of the manifest qualities like whimsically picking strawbenies,"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV and we can't pluck them from our minds like interchangeable counters conjured from mist. Experience persists in apparently recommending meanings without foisting them as simple ciphers for a given quality, as ifthere was something more substantial to the whole than the idea of \"arbitrary impositions\" would allow. Meanings aren't inherences of the polarized \"qualities\". They are not projections or superpositions from an \"independent\" consciousness (which would then have no instrumentality through which to differentiate and apply \"meanings\"). Meanings, after all, require a kind of gestalt elicitation; they are expressions of a compound cognitive grid-network, regardless whether or not that fact exhausts their descriptive significance. They express the relationship between resultant ratios of emphasis constituting the relief field of the \"cognized world\", and the Whole-being consciousness through which the qualities of that world upsurge. Though the ratios-of-emphasis are variable as products of Will (ix. the determinative impulses issued across trajectories through the indeterminate Void-locus), they uniformly arise within thefiamework of a constant (i.e. the whole-being value of Consciousness). All such ratios, constituting the very (perceptual and cognitive) essence of the qualities, are generated in implicit comparative'reference to that Whole- being standard. Thus, the \"qualities\" aren't fixed entities or independent states of setlstatic meaning derived from the pre-existent plenum of Absolute, but variable resultants of the interactions driven by \"detenninative indeterminacy\" of the &-will operator functioning through their elemental extensions. They are thus effects of the relationship between (whole-being) consciousness and its pre-existent potential; insofar as they are qualities at all no matter the range of variability exhibited by their compound character, they potentiate a halo of meaning (not reducible to auy of their attributes) right along with their experiential values. Meaning arises in the relation between Whole-being value, and the comparative qualities engendered from the pre-existent plenum of Its background potentiaL We may refer again to the volitional means of raising a given, experiential venue into being (as function of a stylized gestalt or grid-network patterning elemental ratios of the ideotype). A radius or specialized combination of radii must be drawn into relief (emphasized, stressed by trajectory-of-attention \"pushing off' fiom enabling triangulation of the coordinative potential belonging to the whole \"circle\"); this proportionately recesses other radii so as to generate the contrastive stress-ratios comprising the sine qua non of perception and cognition. Such differential stress, the simplest component for producing any given \"reality-frsunework\", immediately breaks the equivalency resident in the infinite equipotentiality of all radii in themselves. Breaking the (Wte) equivalency by juxtaposed contrast spontaneously finitizes the participating terms. It establishes an angular relation amongst coordinate radii. This restrictive finitization may be felt to generate a kind of \"meaning\" already, as it acquires its finite quality in contrast to the infinite equipotentiality of the circularly-distributed radii as a whole. The stress engendering such meaning can't, however, be abolished or \"set right\" by simple return of the respective radii to their infinite equipotential extensiveness, for this would eliminate the quality (and thus the Creation) through which it arose in the first place. This would constitute a simple and immediate lapse, so that \"meaning\" and \"creation\" never got offthe ground. Rather, the proportion in the particular ratio generating the quality, composed necessarily of unequal \"sections\", immediately calls into being its implicit mirror of counterbalancing proportions (giving a ratio complementary to the first). Corresponding proportions in the radii \"across the way\", on the"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV opposite side of the circle, are automatically drawn upon. This equilibrates and thus \"cancels\" the finitude of things abstracrly, on a global scale, without negating the respective components of the see-saw equation-while focus may remain preferentially pressed upon a particular pole of the global structure. \"Meaning\", then, obviously doesn't inhere by one-to-one equivalency in the given quality (which arises as an angle or combinative ratio of elemental components \"finitizing\" the theoretically-infinite gradation obtaining between radii). Such a quality doesn 't exhaust the require- ment involved in creative potential, as we've seen; it generates a stress with respect to the zero-sum whole. The halo of meanings that may arise around any such quality is generated by the relationship of the quality with respect to the Whole; it doesn't inhere in the quality itself (therefore \"meaning\", while participating in the range of opposites, doesn't collapse into simple equivalenq with the range of opposites--as if \"love\" were just equivalent in significant charge to \"hate\" so that they merely cancel each other). We can't understand the Superior Reality informing our processes, ever ewmpting us from the hell of arbitrary bbreality creation\", unless we understand the perdurable values of Being, the Ontological constants to which we owe allegiance and relative to which we can never stand, \"over against\", as their precedent fabricators and imperious \"endowers\". As an example of the difference between \"meaning\" and \"quality\", and their mutual relationship to the whole: let us consider a particular object of perception; let's contemplate a lemon. (Arduous readers will note our persistent use of this one item in illustrating a universe of implication, cf. Bmhar review etc. \"Lemon\", LMVN, is a Jupiterian fruit first of all-number value 126, cf. \"Motto in the Lotto\"; and its power to get the imagination watering in anticipation of the glands makes it a particularly vivid gift for indelibly exemplifying the whole genre.) \"Lemon\" is a perception elicited through a delimited range of \"elemental ratios\" (considered as the atomic composition of the fiuit, the molecular pattern of your sense-receptors etc.). As such, it establishes a particular sryIe of finitizing stress with respect to the whole. It represents the whole as \"sour\". \"Sourness\" in itself is a quality. But what is its meaning? Is it strictly repellent in terms of meaning? If it had but a single meaning for its given quality, we could say \"meaning\" and \"quality\" were equivalent. However, owing to the perception \"lemon\" being a quality definitionally generated through a specific range in elemental alignments, we find the variable play in ratios-of-adjustment between experiencerlexperience (together composing the total quality) eliciting certain ambiguity as far as the reflexive meaning of the perception is concerned. According to the age or growthconditions of the fiuit, the mood or electrolyte balance of the \"eater\" etc., the quality experienced through-and-as-lemon may be sweetly-sour, tart, gastrically distressing, quenching, exhilarating, attractive or repellent. We don't arbitrariiy assign these responses to the experience. They're a function of the whole being, and the aggregate ratios-of-function obtaining through coordinative constituents of the whole being. Therefore \"lemon\" may represenr that whole in a variety of contingent ways, each conserving the general sense and integrity of \"lemon\". The quality \"lemon\" gives rise to variable meanings, but all such meanings reference the stressstate generated by that quality, to the whole. \"Sourness\" may therefore have negative or positive meaning for us, under any given set of prevailing conditions or compositional ratios permissive of the experience. The \"meaning\" doesn't inhere in the quality (the fiuit, its sourness etc.); it arises in reference of that quality ro the whole. Therefore the \"positiveness\" or \"negativeness\" of a sour lemon may arise as contingent expression of variable conditions and"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV ratios-of-alignment governing the given experience. But the \"positive\" and \"negative\" values themselves aren't arbitrary and equivalent meanings! They refer to a real wholeness-of-being. They give us the current index of correspondence between the compositional elements and governing ratios of our being, and the presiding Whole-being value (the Circle) through which they arise. A \"negative\" response symbolizes something immediate, in terms of the given quality; it's not that the lemon \"is negativem-it gives us an evaluative index of sev-symbolizing states, portraying- affectively-a certain potential in degree of congruency or inharmony relative to Whole-being value. The range allowed into existence through any given quality may seem to be perfectly self-cancelling (i-e. since \"lemon\" seems to range in potential value from \"positive\" to \"negative\" it may appear to negate its own possible uniqueness, relative to all else which equally covers the range and so seems to self-cancel). But the wqv in which it covers and accounts for that range remains finite, and therefore remains both comparative and unique. What is \"positive\", symbolizes our relation to whole-being value in a general way. The \"positive\" experience of an exhilarating spray of lemon, symbolizes our relation to whole-being value in a speczjic way, as a suggestive or \"instructive\" mode (purification; conversion of the acidic, by \"digestion\", to the equilibratively alkaline etc.). Note that \"positivey' and \"negative\" aren't arbitrarily interchangeable and equivalent. They give preferential values with respect to whole-being. This is why \"love\" isn't just a member of the pairs of opposites, arbitrarily equivalent to \"hate\". Love corresponds to Whole-being positively, \"hate\" corresponds negative& to Whole-being. No capricious \"realiry creators \" allowed here! This limits the range of emphasis to a latitude less than arbitrary. Meanings are made essential to the ratios-of-relationship established against Whole-being Standard (visualizable as the total Circle with indeterminately extensive radii, indefinitely minute point, and illimitable background Void). In keeping with the spirit offieedom ascribed to Void-being, arbitrary meanings can be assigned any given value or quality4.e. you can christen a rock as \"God's Bounty\" and send it away in a Care Package; but any such meaning is accountable to the organic derivation of meanings drawn from the relationship characterized above. Freedom is thus perfectly conserved through any given context, yet responsibiiity and consequence aren't thereby negated or overthrown. Deficiencies of operative meaning with respect to the Reality of Whole-being, are a real component of existence. They require compensation, active or passive, as Service to and in implicit homage toward an eternally greater Being than can be embossed or embellished by \"reality creator\", upper-or-lower case. You can 't create your \"own reality\", even given perfect hdom (or precisely owing to perfect freedom)-for the very nature of that zero-factor freedom involves an invariable supply-side of ontological preconditions in support, maintenance, conservation and honor of the Reality represented in that Freedom. Thus the \"you\" and \"your\" addressed by the hortatory \"reality-creating\" expositor fiom elsewhere (or hm \"here\"), is necessarily the \"you\" that creates by doing, acting, perform- ing--therefore such a \"you\" is manifestly a constituted agent, arising precisely through and in expression of the coordinative qualities triangulating the given, variable-pattern instrument as which Will is enabled to modulate its focus, and so impart particular emphasis.

Most critics we've ever known seem contentedly concerned with acting and plotline, production-values, technical or artistic merit, the success with which the filmmaker's interpreted intentions were cai-ried out etc. This is well-and-good at one level since there are standard value-premises assumed between ticketbuyer and merchandiser, a certain minimal and invariant consensus as to what has to be supplied in order for approval to be forthcoming. We can go with that to a degree; but there are all manner of SiskeVEbert specialists in that unrotated field already, whose focus is so comfortably fured with respect to standard criteria (the bare-bones \"who-what-when-where-why-and-how\" of the filmic medium) that it seems a shame simply to duplicate so swell an effort of conventional valuation. There's already a smorgb- bord of intellectual range in that same general zone, so you can Medved if you don't feel like Siskeling, or you can sample along the general line of stock lucubration furnished by Esquire or the L.A.

You may even begin to educe a new form of pleasure fiom such viewing, in the context of an enlarged psychic dimension analogous to the novelty t-v. technocrats try to furnish through 3-d glasses, home THX systems etc. Movie And The Caverns Of Dream To get acquainted with the general drift in the current of this column month to month, let's consider, first of all, just what the experience of movie entertainment is, whether theater variety or home video: the bbmovie-experience\" is, basically, that of a luminous image in a darkened enclosure. Period. Already, we begin to perceive its kinship with dream; for dreaming is in a very real sense the imagistic lighting of an interior darkness. Moreover, movies provide us with sounds and images that are highly stylized, not at all like the visual and audible presentations of ordinary waking experience. There's a syntax to the sensible construction of the movie's elements, an artistic diction that takes into full account the specific requirements of both its spatial and temporal modes of organization. Movies necessarily obey a grammar of composition, of rhythm and movement virtually imposed upon the medium by the restrictions of its recording apparatus in exactly the same way that the restrictions of paint or musical implement, for example, supply the context in which the minimal grammars of pictorial or percussive arts proclaim themselves. The power of the movie medium to render its images in gradations of black and white (and thus, virtually, in pattern of shadow) as well as in colors that aren't naked ocular lights but creatively filtered tones shows us immediately the close kinship of the filmic art with dream, wherein the features of waking reality are similarly sifted and transformed through a psychic grammar that tints \"natural\" hues with properties peculiar to the medium. Film and dream, similarly, refuse to conform to the rigid requirements of spacetime interaction coordinated through (and thus limited by) the neural and muscular operations of the physical body-pattern. In both film and dream we can jump like the electron in its quantum cloud, fiom longshot to closeup and all gradations of midrange by abrupt discontinuous transitions needing no physical rationalization; we can hopscotch backward and forward in time, leapfiog over all"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV vle intervals of spatial or temporal distance and accept such staccato transpositions with the nonchalance accorded any, learned convention of a given vocabulary. We aren't disconcerted in dream when the viewpoint instantly switches without benefit of the laborious mechanics belonging to waking/physical patterns; and similarly we don't blanch at the \"unreality\" of cross-cutting viewpoints or perspectival montage served up by the magic of the available filmic reertoire. The flat reduction of the image, the artificial line of allowable focus with its enforced framing etc. furnishes the stuff of our familiar reality at an order of significant removal, so that all artifices of the filmic vocabulary are immediately acceptable and indeed taken for granted without confusion; and it is the same with the psychically-rendered images of dreams having a certain verisimilitude but existing already at a stylistic remove fiom the physical laws and requirements governing the images of waking life. In this way we come to see that, like the medium of any potential \"art\" or agency of stylistic portrayal the Movie has its own relation to charm, its own claim upon extraordinary fascination. Movie enlists the acceptance of our imagination as does all art, but in a peculiar way typical of its character, in a way which correlates it quite intimately with dream. There is then an additional and very rich dimension to movie-viewing, whether through the projected-dace glow of the big screen theater or the backlit, phosphorescent luminance of the t.v. tube. Movies, in their structural and phenomenal correlation with the psychic medium of the dream-mind, take hold of us all at a level which simply surpasses the superficial scan of conventional mind (concerning itself with the logic of plot development, the motivation of character etc.). Though the explumtion as to the deep relationship between movie and dream may seem archly abstract and remotely intellectual, we are influenced by that relationship at a level that does not depend upon the understanding, the acceptance or rejection of formal explanation. We don't have to follow the explanation of the film-dream correlation to be tremendously affected by it. And of course, because we're immediately affected by that correlation independent of rational recognition we're influenced most strongly at the very level of the symbolizing, subcon- scious dream-strata itseIfwhere the light of conscious reflection doesn't automatically penetrate. This should help account for powerful behavioral influences exerted upon an audience passively absorbing not only the overt picture-impressions but subtle connotations and analogically extensive undertones, communicated in the quick pulse and montage-bursts of sounds, of lights and images juxtaposed so as to charge the symbol-weaving psyche with oddly meaningful resonances, non-ver- bal but potent cues. (Do we subscribe therefore to the \"conspiracy theory\" of human motivation, that we move en masse according to the promptings of the nefarious media-programmers of the psyche? Not necessarily. Deliberate \"strobing\" of messages is certainly available through such media; but the unique juxtapositions and perceptual syntheses ordered by the grammar of movie montage can be considered more commonly as reflux of a quasi-intentional \"half light\" on the part of the movie maker--the creative film artist and schlock film-meister alike being allured and subliminally charmed by the oneiric powers and properties of the glowing editor.) If then the filmmaker himself (like the creative personality of any field only wielding potentially preemptive clout) is not only relative \"master\" but wistful victim of the twilight properties emanating fiom his own medium, may we not propose that he's particularly susceptible to whispers fiom some corpuscular Intelligence using unlit avenues of the dream domain as impressional means by which to post its communications?"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Dolby Oracle After all, this isn't so far-fetched when we remember that Seth (remember Seth?) explained through Jane Roberts that the genius of Higher Intelligence belonging to dimensions other than the familiar physical established communication-4.e. \"charmeled\" the patterns of its infor- mation--through the subliminal or dream mind of the channeler; the form of discarnate Intelligence of which we're receiving such popular bombardment in the New Age circuit (and of so wide a range of merit, since the original value of the Seth Material!) always percolates up through psychic strata of the deep mind, through the rich bed of symbolizing syntax in making its emergent connection to the rational mind of the \"channeler\". Higher Intelligence is by vocation awake in (and extends through) the psychic dream-strata as the very spirit contained in those correlative terms, so that in Speaking through the relatively dim \"waking light\" of the physically-oriented channeler such Intelligence is able to stretch the range of spiritual cognition ordinarily available to the literal interpretation of daytime focus. Why then shouldn't the filmmaker, at least selectively, be a particularly susceptible subject for the imparting of such super-sensible communication through the dream stfZtta? Like any artist he wouldn't have to be an overt channeler at all; the influence could be purely subliminal, never rising to the surface of consciousness as the superposition of a \"separate\" intelligence. Thus the Nudge imparted to such a creative fellow, intercepted at the conscious level as purely \"personal\" inspiration, could easily find its way into the context and very content of the resultant Movie! The filmmaker himself might not (and probably wouldn't) have any idea such specific symbolism was encoded through the elements of his film. He might well enjoy the finished product as a purely \"private effort\" whereas in fact it was simply burgeoning, bursting at the brimming seams with a wealth of transpersonal Types and Cosmically Significant allusion. In this light, let's take a closer look this time at George Lucas' Star Wars. A Note On Notariqon Ah, dear reader4on't fade so fast! Did you fear you were about to be strapped once more into spectator-seats at the intellectual operating theater? forced to watch yet another sterile virtuoso cut into the flimsiest entertainments and pull out the viscera of vague Jungianisms for academic edification? Rest assured that will never happen with Monty as your movieguide ...(al- though if Star Wars has been likely-enough ground for such New Age stars as the late Joseph Campbell to confidently stake the flags of familiar archetype, one hardly sees what the readership could possibly begrudge its fiiendly film-critic!) On the contrary, we're going to brush off our Codex containing the elements of the dream-grammar belonging to good old Qabalistic interpretation, and proceed to point out some very specific \"implants\", some almost flagrant evidences of a praetematural Intelligence having passed nocturnally over the Lucas landscape leaving telltale signatures in the most familiar pop-cultural artifacts such as the names of heroes and villains, concrete plot elements etc. What's that you say? You can't follow your fiiendly film-critic because you're not familiar with Qabalah? And you don't intend to take it up now? (After all, do Reed and Whatley expect you to know Sanskrit, or to be on familiar tms with the Rosetta Stone simply in order to sit through a review of European Vacation?) Take heart.

Well then let's swing straightway over the abyss of the dream-mind with Luke and Leia, and begin our scrutiny of the original Star Wars fiom a whole dzferent angle (where we can hone the blade of unfamiliar tools against the grindingstone of quite-familiar profiles). PART II The Qabalah Of Star Wars In fact, let's first look in on the hero of the Star Wars opus, young Luke himself. The name Luke, of course, may be considered the fantasy-fulfillment signature of filmmaker Lu- cas self-admittedly enamored of the old Flush Gordon serials; it might well be within the range of his waking Will to have projected himself eponymously knowing that \"Luke\" and even \"Lucas\" derive fiom \"luce\", light; then of course the name \"Slqwalker\" could be con- strued as intentional as well, since the \"light that wab the sky\" is sunlight, thus very deliberately making the \"star\" of Star Wars a modem ex- pression of the Solar Myth. That \"Luke Sky- walker\" may be meant as a contemporary Sun-hero, however, does not in itself take us further than the Jungianism we solemnly foreswore at the outset, nor does it give us any example that might extend beyond the likely reach of the filmmaker's deliberate design. (Keep the analysis in mind, however, and compare with what is to come.) Another hero of the familiar saga is the magician and Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi. What a curious name, don't you think? Obi-Wan ... curious until you consider that the \"channeled\" treatise of the twentieth century thaumaturgist (magician, in the ancient sense) Aleister Crowley, i.e. Liber Al vel Legis (The Book of the Law) speaks in Chapter 1, Verse 37 of working the magick of the \"obeah and the wanga\". \"Obeah\" is a well-known form of Afiican magic-indeed its alternative spelling is precisely \"Obi\"; \"wanga\", (even apparently unknown to Crowley, at least at the time of his having written the commentary to that particular passage) is a Haitian Creole term of Bantu origin and refers to a type of voodoo sorcery. Consistent with such a theme, may we offer that \"Kenobi\" refers obliquely to Kano, a Nigerian city anciently the site of certain seed-practices?"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV and is as well an Egyptian reference pertaining to the \"Canopic\" jar in which the viscera of the dead were interred for magickal purposes? Hot Under he Collar In any case, all of this is still in theoretical range of the filmmaker's intentional activityeven if by now it's rapidly outdistancing the probable; but we are, at least, squarely in the Qabalistic ballpark for, despite the possible wails of the Hebrew Qabalists elicited in protest at this point the communicated text of Liber A1 vel Legis is specifically Qabalistic and draws in large part on the esoteric terminologies and correspondences of the Magical Order of the Golden Dawn, of which Crowley was a former member. (As for \"Jedi\", could this be a reference to the spiritually honorific title of the Hindus, i.e. \"Jaddu\" as in the designation \" Jaddu Krishnarnurthi\"?) If there is then a fairly persuasive argument as to the existence of \"veiled allusion\" in the heroes' names whether intended or sub-tended, what are we to find in that of the villain? What of the really eagerly anticipated consideration, that of Darth Vader? In order to understand this one it's necessary to take quick detour into the actual graphics of the Qabalah, specifically its traditional glyph the Tree of Life depicted below. The circles of the glyph are called Sephiroh and represent the multidimensional phases both of man and the greater universe, illustrating a very specific correlation. At the level of the dotted Sephirah, an invisible horizontal axis called the Greater Abyss demarcates the point of transition between the \"higher\" or Divine-creative dimensions of Being, and the \"lower\" or created dimensions notoriously subject to imbalance and illusion. This abyssal juncture at which the dotted Sephirah is placed, corresponds in the superposed human form to the back of the neck (and by extension the throat). In all magical and esoteric traditions of both East and West, the back of the neck signifies a special location. In the summary explanation of the yogic systems it represents the crucial phase oftransition at which spiritual energies are \"converted\" into material and vice versa. The kundalini energy (ordinarily locked into the spinal base, in its position of \"exiling\" the greater magnitudes of spiritual force fiom direct illumination ofthe head and thus of the liberative \"higher Mind\") may be balanced and harmonized through the chakras or vertical system of plexuses and endocrine centers in such a way as to \"uncoil\" fiom its serpentine lockin. On the occasion of this spiritually portentous moment, it participates in an overall repolarization of the currents and energy-fields of the mind-body form; it aligns and inteaorates the multidimensional systems at progressively higher levels of intensity and potential wholeness. The back of the neck represents the crucial transition-point at which the awakened nature current of the kundalini pauses, as it were, and gathers itself for the fateful leap wherein it \"hurls the abyss\" between the lower and higher centers correlated with the lower and higher \"worlds\". It is at this juncture that an opening to cosmic influences takes place; such an opening or vulnerability is operative even in all those for whom the \"awakening of the serpent power\" is"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV practically so remote as to be of virtually no moment at all, and it's particularly stimulated by inordinate amounts of alcohol, narcotic or mind-manifesting drugs etc. The influx of \"cosmic influence\" is especially critical in the case of a full-scale kundalini incident; influences of both a positive and a negative, a balanced and imbalanced kind are available through the test of that juncture. At such a crucial stage the \"unloaded magazine\" of the multidi- mensional nature-current, with more of its repertoire readied, sits sizzling at the basal brain-its distinct presence there even \"heard\" internally as a hissing or crackling, and felt as an electric flicker in the medullary region. At that position it is, at least temporarily, firing instinctual systems coded into the R-complex (the reptilian hindbrain) corresponding \"above to below\" with the abdominal centers, the coccygeal plexus etc. Intense vitalization and arousal of the patterns pertaining to instinctual claims, territoriaVsurvival and reproductive modes as well as the \"will-to-power\" associated with the solar plexus, swell overall psychic sensitivity relative to the respective overtures of those \"positive\" and \"negative\" influences. Successful alignment with the influence of the cosmic-positive draws the serpent power, or kundalini, by strong attraction into the cerebral zones themselves awakening the fabled third eye, and making more-available deep values of spiritual insight and creative intelligence. This turns the \"head\" of the kundalini-serpent (or nature current) by positive polarization-alignment, into the higher lobes with deferential reference toward the abstract powers and divine properties of a genuine spiritual Gnosis, situated structurally in relation to the cerebral \"cap\" or cortical sahasrara. On the other hand, should the personality experiencing such transitional vitalization of the sacral zones and corresponding instinctual patterns of the basal brain succumb by tendency to the blandishments of incursive, cosmic forces of the \"other side\", the Dark Powers of the Greater Abyss will have diverted the aspirations of the soul soaring up on the spinal \"back\" of the kundalini-serpent, and will have effectively locked the energy at that no-man's juncture bordering the \"back of the head\"; in this case the higher, creative spiritual faculties and occult powers associated with the third eye and upper head centers will themselves be turned or negatively bent in deferential reference toward the magical kundalini-rod sizzling like a flashing light-saber at the locus of the R-complex, or \"reptilian hindbrain\". In this way, spiritual and creative factors (i.e. occult or esoteric cognitions and values) may be put in service to the lower ego-drives of territorial domination, conquest and personal power thus upping the ante on the \"individual survivalist stakes\" and giving occult comfort to the negative hypothesis, the glamorizing propaganda of ego-inflation belonging to the Dark Side. Attack From The Back Do you begin to see the analogy with Darth Vader, the fonner Jedi Knight, who was \"seduced by the dark side of the Force\"? Vader was a former Jedi Knight necessarily; for it is occult or spwtual practice along the path of the Metaphysical Warrior that alone conditions the opportunity for that crisis juncture of consciousness to arise, with respect to the \"raised\" kundalini. He wasJirst a Jedi Knight or esoteric practitioner before he could even qualify for confrontation with the bifurcation of paths; for that branching juncture only really occurs at the \"brink of the abyss\", and one is brought there only on the \"back\" of the dragon-serpent, the hissing and crawling kundalini. That crossroads of energy-alignment and intensification at the back of the head represents such a unique position of dual influence, and presents in particular such an opportune moment for the \"dark side\" to enter and gain ground, owing to the fact that it draws one's operative energy-complexes"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV parallel the cosmic plane of those nether, instinctuaYvita1 forces of the abdominal centers. Under ordinary conditions (the common functional level of humanity-in-general) those vital forces are operated indirect& by the pattern of self-encoiled currents on a greatly reduced or \"masked\" scale, fkom the locus of the basal brain or R-complex. We can see then that Darth Vader represents a blown-up version (extended through \"hidden dimensions\" and equipped with psi powers or quickened faculties enlisted to the service of self-aggrandizing aims) of the ordii avaricious ego stuck with the conventional inventory of armaments in the same way that Leona Helmsley represents a blown-up version of the petty embezzler. In esoteric terms, then, Vader's operative locus of influence or \"position of exploitative power\" would be the vulnerable entrance into the subconscious complexiistinctual systems opened at the back of the head. This uncanny juncture is explicitly illustrated in all its lurid potential through the familiar Tarot Trump The Moon (the new Tom Petty album, mirabile dim, is titled Full Moon Fever and displays the A. E. Waite version of the card patterned on the Golden Dawn rendition; the accepted correspondences in the system of that early 20th Century magical Order ascribe the Hebrew letter Qoph, meaning \"back of the head\", to that Trump). The Secret, which makes that crucial cross-roads at the back of the head so uniquely ripe for the dual overtures of \"positive\" and \"negative\" influence, has to do with the fact that ordinary physical-style perception is locked in place by an ingenious network of polarized fields constructing an \"anisometric\" (relatively imbalanced) system of cognitive coordinates operative across the fkonWbasal-oriented axis associated with subconscious plexi of the vagus bundles. These auto- nomic processes, seemingly \"set\", in fact function along the loom of an elastic indeterminacy deriving fkom the conscious axis of which they're dependent, organizational currents. The rhythms and functional patterns required to conserve the psychic typology of a particular, compound-focal fkamework of perceptionkognition, condense fiom the variable deter- minations in the identity-training of that axis. The responsive, subconscious currents shift the variable term of their own coordinate agencies on a sliding scale around the Zero-value unifonnly comprising the Standard and common denominator of every, discrete dimension or functional field of the mind~body being."},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The basal orientation of the currents as they conserve and enforce the \"downward\" focus along the multidimensional axis into contrastive extremes of dipolar physical emphasis, draws the force of conscious identification \"offsidem--away fiom harmonious congruence with its own void-stem in itself. Such lower-plexus concentration and basal, vital-instinctual entrainment of the cognitive processes has the effect of \"unzipping\" the unitive axis into a relatively \"unintegrated\" pattern of opposing terms. An integrative \"reversal\" of such orientation, of course, polarizing the current-processes into a pattem conducive to the self-congruence and harmony of the conscious axis, has the effect of \"zipping up\" the artificially segregated, imbalanced coordinates. The locus of the back of the head marks the critical transition-point in the integrative ''zipup\" along the conscious axis; for not only does it mark the transition between the spinal and ceib& systems physically but between the compound patterning processes of the autonomic networks (hctioning through the indeterminate variable of the Conscious value) and that Zero- value itself: The creative systems and dimensional centers corresponding physically to the head, --. operate overtly on the spirituallabsolute basis of that Zero-value; the created of the systems and dimensional centers corresponding to zones below the head necessarily operate on the implicit basis of that universal Zero-value and structural \"common denominator\", but they're subject to overt masking and polarized deflection into broken pattern of anisometric \"charge\" (through the compound, focal coordinate field) that exert the persuasive pressure of opaque physical real&. The \"concreteness\" of physical reality, though secretly organized through the universal factor of Void, serves to effectively mask the Common ~enominatorbf zero-value-through which all other possible fields and forces equally operate, and so serves to practically screen physical perqtion fiom direct regard of tho& alternative potencies and additional powers. At the juncture of the back of the head that Void-value or Zero factor secretly resides; the basal brain locale is the invisiblel&own threshold (i.e. the place of transition be&n lower \"created\" and higher \"creative\" zones) mediating the potentially covert and essentially overt existence of that Zero-value. At the direct locus of that junct&e, then, the secret c&nmon denominator of the Zero-value may be exploited by beings, forces or personalities having direct access to if so as to create an infl~ential~~eabili~ with respect to the \"heavy\", blocked-out or masked field of ordinary physical cognitions. Through this &hold void-zone at the base of the brain, the netherworld and cosmic forces gain a kind of back-door access to the conscious and subconscious systems of the ordinary personality focally \"fixed\" and locked in hypnotic thralldom to the tightly screened zone of the physical field (cf. the nonfiction book Communion by author and screenwriter Whitley Streiber; - - fortified with this esoteric description you will understand what is happening to him, although he is unable to manifest such understanding on his own behalf in any of the text). The Dark Lord Of The Sith In the Qabalistic system, the dotted sphere or Sephirah which corresponds to this transitional stage at the \"back of the head\" is called Daath. It should become plain to the reader at this point that \"someone\" or \"something\" having to do with the creative process of the movie Star Wars wished to impart the subliminal communique, solvent to the application of Qabalistic criteria,"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV that there was a potential for negarive invasion at the \"Daath junction\", i.e. at the locus behind and toward the base of the head. For Darth Vader is now very transparently understood as Daath Invader. The invader fkom Daath. Vader is known in the epic as \"the Dark Lord of the Sith\". \"Sith\" easily decodes as Seth or Set, the negative principle in Egyptian mythology responsible for the death and disrnember- ment of Osiris (originally a lunar or fertility deity, and eventually a full-blown Solar god accounting for both seasonal and nocturnal \"disappearance\" of the sun's productive power); remember that Vader ostensibly \"kills\" Obi-Wan Kenobi, seeming to eclipse the beneficent Jedi only to have him become \"more powefi than\" Vader could possibly imagine\". Ben 'n' Her, Or The King And \"I\" That Obi-Wan is squarely connected to the Solar mythology of the epic by Qabalistic correspondence, is clearly demonstrated in his nickname, \"Ben\". For Ben in Hebrew is \"son\", and, like the \"son of man\" is given as a descriptive term to the central Sephirah Tiphereth on the Tree of Life. All the Sephiroh correspond to \"planets\" (in the astrological sense); and to Tiphereth is ascribed the Sun. Importantly, Tiphereth in the initiatic system of the magical Tree represents a landmark of adeptship, the station of Adeptus Minor. It indicates the significant opening and empowerment of the Heart center (Tiphereth is ascribed to the heart in its physical symbolism), and the limbic system of the mid-brain with its pituitary body identified, by polar correspondence, with the heart. Note that in Qabalah Daath, which means \"knowledge\", is often referred to as Death (in the sense it represents the juncture of a fateful \"fall\" into the spiritual death of vital incarnation and rounds of identified attachment to imbalanced, \"densified\" pleasures of physical existence in itself). And in Star Wms, Vader operates out of the artificial satellite of the Death Star. This Death Star is itself a transparent symbol of Daath. For remember, in the film even Han Solo is fooled at first into thinking that the artificial satellite is arealplanet. And the sole, dotted Sephirah of Daath is so rendered in order to indicate its actual artificiality. It is called the false Sephirah; for it is not really a center (as the head or heart centers etc.) but a place of transition, the elastic variable of the void-factor functioning across a sliding scale of coordinate integration and alignment so as to alternatively mask or disclose the absolute/creative Zero-status of Being through the subconscious patterning processes of the multidimensional Conscious axis. \"Sephirah\" is associated etymologically with sapphire, so that it not only signifies a sphere of Being; it indicates the self-luminance or stany radiance of the crystalline worlds and zones of existence. The false Sephirah Daath is therefore literally a false star, an artificial satellite in the Qabalistic system. The Death Star hangs suspended in the twinkling of cosmic space just as Daath hovers at that. dotted gap between the Sapphire-stone of Binah and the parallel, zodiacal sphere or star-house of Chokmah. This correspondence of Vader7s \"Death Star\", neatly accounts for an incident in the movie which initially drew objection on the grounds of logic, i.e. the appearance in the trash-com- pactor sequence of the snakelike Dia-noga that properly harrowed the heroes but seemed summoned fkom special-effects in deus-ex-machina manner; for how, quick observers carped at the time, could any organic worm such as Dia-noga show up in a marsh of refuse which was hardly a natural bog, but simply a room in the artificial satellite? Understanding the Death Star as the Daath juncture accounts for the presence of that strange, serpentine apparition not by the critical light of daytime"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV logic but, most appropriately, by the nocturnal glow of dream-logic. If we understand the Death Star through our dream-consciousness, the subliminal and symbolizing power of movies becomes more apparent and takes on a scale much beyond the scope of personal contribution. In this way we can immediately \"see\" the presence of Dia-noga in the trash compactor as the fateful presence of the risen kundalini-serpent, worrying the vulnerable locus at the back of the head. Dream logic. The kundalini-serpent playing at the artificial juncture of Daath. Moreover, the specific designation of Dia-noga's locale as the trash compactor aligns the symbolism very powefily with the properties of the qlippoth or \"imbalanced shells\" of negative cosmic force, known to gain access at the tremulous juncture of Daath owing to their correspondence with the instinctuaVvita1 energies of the basal brain and correlative abdominallre- productive centers. The Qlippoth are literally considered the debris or \"trash\" discharged from negative, debilitated or imbalanced psychic-emotional patterns. (This glaring logical anomaly sticking from the narrative like a sore thumb, suggests rather strongly the incalculable factor of a hidden presence working some subliminal influence on the film's structure--a film which became, after all, one of the top five box-office draws of all time.) Laying The Organic Ground \"Princess Leia\" gives us another strong Qabalistic reference; esoteric interpretation of the Biblical \"Rachel and Leah\" indicates two aspects of the very Sekinah (or energy, power) of the Divine. Sekinah is linked etymologically to the term Sakti, a Hindu designation for cosmic energy that becomes locked into place and thus \"exiled\" as a fixed hework of focus in the kundalini- nucleus (the etymological linkage thus infers a shared spiritual understanding of the \"separate\" ancient cultures, scarcely acknowledged contemporarily at all). The Sekinah of course is the power of God to which is imputed the feminine gender, classically \"exiled\" to the wilderness of physical existence. The exiled Sekinah indeed accounts for the field of physical existence itself, just as the coiled kundalini-sakti holds the exclusive, physical Wework of focus \"in place\" as a summary energy-nucleus at the perineum (encoding the coordinate sequences and filtrate patterns of percep tion ordered through centers of compound focal alignment, situated~ultidimensionally-across the conscious axis). In her exile or \"descended\" form the Sekinah is denominated the Divine Footstool, and this corresponds exactly with the Hindu Padmasana, literally \"divine footstool\". Rachel and Leah represent the dual potentiality of the Sekinah \"exiled\" into identification with the physical field; they signify respectively the barren/mournfid or brightfdevoted Sekinah, the potentiality of the encoiled Lifepower to \"turn away\" from the luminous immediacy of Spirit (figuratively situated \"above\" at the innate Void-locus of spiritual awakening) or to turn toward It in liberative surrender. Just to make this correspondence all the more unmistakable, \"Princess Leia\" is given the full name ofLeia Organa, making her \"exiled\" identification with the organic or material sphere symbolically patent. While Rachel then \"mourns for her lost children\" (the souls suffering the delusive exile of exclusive physical existence locked into the survivalist \"vital zone\"), Leah aspires tirelessly toward active liberation. This \"Princess\" is indeed the Bride and Princess (the actual, Qabalistic designation) of Malkuth, the lowest Sephirah of the Tree of Life corresponding to the Material World and specifically indicated as the \"place of exile\" of God's creative power, the Sekinah."},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV It shouldn't be overlooked that we come to frnd out, in the sequels The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, that both Luke and Leia are the ofspring of none other than Darth Vader. This easily suggests that Leia, in her form as the \"exiled princess\" of the physical sphere, represents the responsive energy of the Sekinah creatively working out and living the consequences (through organic subconscious patterns) of the very conscious and deliberate apostasy of the \"Dark Lord of the Sith\", initiated will and awareness gone perversely awry. Leia's predicament is precisely a result of her being the offspring of Vader: the father of physical suffering and exile is the \"initiated\" (conscious) application of will and desire for purposes of personal Apotheosis. It gives practical birth to the field of material delusion or functional imbalance, by borrowing upon the power of void-nature exclusively for the knowledge it can yield in its barrier-dissolving permeability; for knowledge (don't forget, Daath is \"knowledge\") enlists the value of Void only insofar as its efficacy helps acquire practical means of securing causal connections for purposes of mastery/domination. Knowledge (Daath) never asks of its own void-character the illumining insight of real Understanding or Wisdom (the upper Sephiroh). The Dad Zone The fact that Vader is also Luke's father, gives away another significant piece of Qabalistic correspondence; for if Luke, like Obi, represents a solar hero owing to the fact that his name means Light, then he is the potential initiate of Tiphereth (the sphere of the Sun) as well; and indeed, we see through the plot development that Luke becomes a strong candidate for initiation into the overtly occult, Jedi brotherhood. But a title of Tiphereth is Eloah va-daath, showing that it derives directly-through the \"middle pillar\"4m the abyssal pseudo-Sephirah Daath immedi- ately above it. Thus the \"solar ego\" of Tiphereth, the potential candidate of illumining initiation, is tinctured already with a questionable background, an ambiguous heritage. Not only is it the \"product\" of the preceding real Sephiroh Kether/Chokmah/Binah; in its projection as the central- izing vehicle of self-reference in the system of created worlds \"below the abyss\" it reflects a bastard derivation from Daath, inevitably tainted with a capacity for aggravated imbalance and inflationary self-aggrandizement. (We see this reflected in Luke's impatience, his frequent vacillation and tendency not to listen etc.) Thus in order to \"resurrect\" the true Father, restoring the former Order (the disbanded and repudiated Jedi) to a renewed and whole glory in himself, Luke frnds he must overcome the dark aspect, the tincturing \"Vader\" within his own personality (a challenge made quite explicit in the cave sequence of Empire). Indeed at the end (Retm of the JedQ in a finale so unsatisfactory to so many, we even see Vader literally \"reborn\" as it were in Light and restored in brotherhood with a glorified Obi-Wan. Narratively this may have been forced; it is only symbolicalIy that it's assuredly correct. Luke's overcoming the internal factors of negativity and imbalance so as to restore the original Wholeness and Order of the Father, is exactly analogous to the Egyptian \"Horus\" myth; for Horus is the falcon god or Hawk-headed Lord who vanquishes the chthonic force of Set, resurrecting the dismembered Father Osiris and restoring him to his sacred throne. Both Osiris and Horus are solar deities. The Son integrated with the Totality of the Father is the formula of Ab-Ben; i.e. Ab (father) and Ben (son) fuse so as to form the Path which successfully crosses the Abyss connecting Tiphereth and Chokmah through the formula of Aben, which means Stone and refers to the confected Philosopher's Stone, the Great Work Accomplished."},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV I Am All-One Speaking of the Hawk-headed deity Horus, this brings us to the other \"hero\" of the trilogy, Han Solo. Considering Han's caprice, his virtually comic vacillation between pure self-in- terest and selfless help, we might be tempted to fmd in \"Han\" the shorthand signature of Hanuman, the mischievous monkey-god of Hindu mythology equated with that restless trickster the \"thinking mind\" itself. In this case, considering the conspicuously autoerotic activity of the monkey, Han's behavior can often be accounted by assuming \"Han\" is an abbreviation of hand, which when engaged in \"Solo\" business completes an adequately allusive metaphor of his generally self-pos- sessed attitude. But \"Han\" can also easily suggest Had,the abbreviated form of Hadit. \"Had\" in Persian literally means \"limit\"; it is apotheosized in the aforementioned Book of the Law as an important ontological principle. There it signifies the \"atomic soul\", the \"point infiiely small\" which is the vehicular basis of manifestation, the \"heart\" of the world and functional median as the centralizing locus of selfhood. The declaration of Hadit in the Book of the Law is \"I am alone\"; thus Han (Had) Solo (Alone). And let us not forget the most important clue of all; Han is the pilot (soul) of the Millennium Falcon. Could this \"falcon\" be the falcon-god or Hawk-headed Lord Horus quite specifically, after all? We may answer in the emphatic probable; according to the doctrine associated with A. Crowley's Book of the Law, this Age of Aquarius we are ostensibly entering upon is esoterically identified as the Aeon of Horus, the Crowned and Conquering Child (i.e. victorious Luke Skywallcer etc.). Is this Aeon of the Hawk-headed Lord not represented very conspicuously in the vehicle of the Millennium Falcon, which jumps hyperspace with ease and \"made the Kessel run in 12 parsecs\"? The very name Star Wars now resonates to the fact that the Sephiroh of the Tree of Life signify stany or self-radiant spheres, and that Horus is a specifically martial deity. (You may figure such things as the \"Wookie, Chewbacca\", \"R2D2\" and \"C3PO\" for yourself, for we'd hate to deprive you of the possible morsels of pleasure yet left in your newfound love of Qabalah, as well as your respect for George Lucas as a premier Qabalist! On the other hand we can't resist the clue that the robots ought to be considered as representative of the dual autonomic currents of the subconscious systems, especially since the autonomic is servitor of the conscious axis ... and don't forget to do a Qabalah on those letters and numbers.) Oh yes; no sense hounding poor Lucas about \"secretly being a great Mystery-tradition initiate\" etc. We may rest assured that the economic hypothesis of \"subliminal influence\" is adequate to explain the peculiar facts of Star Wars; after all, did you catch Howard the Duck?

'891 IE REVIEW What Batman Is Everyone Watching? Batman Back to the dream caves. Bat first, let's take a look at the sociological phenome- non of Batman's astonishing populari ty... hold it! Isn't it possible to just review the movie, and keep the potential value of the film completely separate fiom its effect on the public, its economic and political impact, its influence on the weather? Well, actually, no. It would have been possible to review the movie qua movie before its explosion into \"le pheno- mene sociologique\" (as Francois Truffaut dubbed the UFO inci- dent in Close Encounters). But this plebeian film critic didn't get into the previews with a press pass; no, being a man of the masses, he watched the 01' Caped Crusader down in the trenches with the general public, and by that time it was too late to keep separate the solitary phenomenon of a shining bubble fiom the billows of popularity in which the film of fioth was subsequently swamped. So first of all, one must ask with a little Marvin Gaye pivot: what's going on? Does anyone seem to recall how, not too long ago, preview audiences watching the trailer for Ridley Scott's Blade Runner became wildly anticipatory for the film's release on the I started a joke That started the whole world crying',. basis of the fantastic cityscapes etc. (with which, incidentally, the Batman matte-work has now been often compared) only to leave the picture high and dry shortly after its premiere by a word-of-mouth and general critical disclaimer that the movie was too bbmurky\"? Well, hey, Dudes; just seven years after, it seems neither critics nor audiences are so uniformly sensitive toward the merely \"murky\". For not only is Batman a deliberate noire film, of a richly miasmal murk that makes Blade Runner twinkle like a Christmas- tree; it is often cruel and mean-spirited (don't start up on your dear reviewer yet--this isn't even the criticism) in much the same way that Paul Verhoeven's Robocop was peculiarly remorseless in its pursuit of the gratuitously nasty. In case you haven't thought about it, what becomes of Jerry Hall's model face, the death-rnask dressup in which it's all done replete with a litter of photographed wardead gassed into closeup grimaces of risus sardonicus, leaves a tinge of cyanic green about the *\"I Started A Joke\", 01976 Polygrarn Records, Inc."},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV gills much like the chemically-altered epidermis of the Joker's complexion; and the accompanying \"mirth\" which Nicholson's performance squeezes in a milk of ambiguity out of the audience, is almost in schizoid dissociation from the necrotic breath breathed off the screen. This is hardly the kind of fare which audiences have \"traditionally\" made boxoffice champions-by comparison the \"horrors\" of Jaws was a jack-in-the-box, while Raiders and E. T. were positively ingratiating. Nor is it really possible to write off the public's record-breaking response solely to the Pavlovian conditioning of pre-fiim hype and saturation merchandising; for at best the gates jump open to a fast start under pressure of such periodic campaigns. If there isn't something in the \"product\" itself to sustain enthusiasm to a snowball surge and induce the very necessary repeat business, the genuine \"phenomene sociologique\" does not automatically ensue (witness the De Laurentiis campaign for King Kong, or even the merchandising putsch for Star Wars 111, which comparatively \"sagged\" at the boxofice after an opening burst primed with the powder of pure anticipation). But what is there in this Bat-product? Don't misunderstand the question; it does not imply the film has no merit--indeed, such a question doesn't really address the merit of the film at all. The question of actual merit would lead us to declare that Blade Runner, for example, was a wonderfd movie; but one of the things which distinguished it as \"wonderfid\" was the powerfdly dark, lethally dense atmosphere of its view--precisely the characteristic which at the time was said to \"tun the public off\". The real question here, if properly understood, admits to a Mystery. We're standing in the presence of a wildly popular Sphinx. For one thing, consider: Warner Bros., the producer of the film, was reported to be in desperate straits and conceived Batman as the means of bailing itself ou~ not only out of the boxoffice doldrums but the wrecking yards of receivership. Now, when you are deliberately planning a vehicle which has to hit critics and audiences in such a way as to make an initial splash and subsequent tsunami on the magnitude of nine figures and rolling, simply in order to tread, you would suppose that conservatism and strict adherence to precedent would be the key. You'd think that computer-averaged, statistically-researched actuarial compromise would be the watchword. Imagine sitting in on the executive foreplay to such an ultimate conception. It comes to your attention that it's DC Comics' 50th anniversary of Batman; you immediately recall the popularity the t.v. series briefly enjoyed in the '60s. So far so good. You'd assume the thing to do would be to swiftly wed those facts to some \"fonnula\" derived from basic elements of the top ten moneymakers of all time (in other words, break into the SpielbergLucas safetydeposit vaults where the celluloid Rosetta Stone is kept). But Nooooooooo. Somehow, inexplicably, you decide to do Batman as film noir. Somehow, inexplicably, you pass up Schwarzenegger and Stallone for ... Michael Keaton? Some- how, inexplicably, you decide, whether consciously or unconsciously, to make Batman all about- poison! For yes, that is what this Batman is ultimately about. It's about poison. It breathes poison. (Back off; this isn't the criticism either.) It has, altogether, the frozen grin of the Deathshead sporting crossbones-clavicle on a bottle of thallium. The great \"body\" of Gotham City, looking like an hallucinatory New York out of Lang's Metropolis, is backed up, trash impacted, plugged with industrial and human debris so that the ordinary anonymity and impersonal austerity of mountain-"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV ous metropolitan architecture takes on the dun-dead visage of an anatomy text coldly viewing viscera of some constipated Alien. \"What this city needs, is an enema,\" the Joker observes quite cogently-4er all, it's not for nothing Batman's dossier on Jack Napier-notes his high intelligence; it's the implicit statement being made by that intelligence in the design of its demented plot, that holds the secret dream-key to the whole movie. In The Bladder Of The Joker's Boutonnih-e For one can have no quarrel with what the Joker perceives, fiom the summit of his murder-acquired suite. The city is certainly dying of its own unassimilable waste; mankind is already all-but-trashed. Such \"high\" intelligence looking down fiom the imperious remove of its money- insulated viewpoint, can't be faulted in the ice-edge of its vision. Intelligence that technically elevated, perceives correctly-with a great deal more incisiveness than the middling muddle being meditated by the fume-addled masses below. No, one can't fault the clarity of vision; the city indeed needs an enema. Yet the conclusions which are drawn fiom the counsel of such an intelligence operating entirely without a heart are indeed utterly insane. First of all, how did the City become so contaminated? The very mind that observes how \"backed up\" it is, had a direct hand in the proceedings. The movie starts out, after all, with an investigation of racket-control in the chemical industry. We see there's no effectual policing of the offending businesses, since it's quickly demonstrated that law-enforcement (in the form of a noir homage to Welles' Captain Vargas in A Touch of Evil) dances to industry's tune, serving its requirements--and both the tune and the requirements are equal to Money. Indeed the culprit isn't immune to the conditions he causes; the over-the-edge dementia giving fatal cyanic tinge to the Joker's cortex as well as to his complexion comes about as the result of a perfect stroke of justice: he plunges into a bile-green vat which serves to fieeze the flesh of severed facial nerves into a perpetual grinning mask. It is the very logic of that cold intelligence weighing everything on the scale of money, which backs up on itself and floods its own bloodstream with the poison it propagated everywhere. Having fouled itself with such cold objectivity, its worship of the aloofhess purchased by--and characteristic of--a power without heart, it comes to love thatpoison for its own sake. The poison has become its bloodstream. What everyone else seems to diefiom, has transmogrified into the Joker's life-juice. He feeds on it. Take note. What, one must ask, is the audience watching when it views the Joker's \"plot\" unfold? What does the audience come back and back in a ritual summer compulsiveness to see, when the Joker is shown going about his blissful business mixing poisons and mortal toxins into the hauspray and foundation makeup of a populace quite equal in implicit identity to the multitudes packing the theater-houses? And the secret-the secret of all that poison! How indeed does the Joker do it? For one can never be sure which product will contain the clownish surprise! It is only Batman, Batman alone, who figures it out: it's in the combination. No spray or lipgloss alone may do it (remember?); but several such products in combination may suddenly react, and the ghoulish result leaves a dead newscaster on the live airwaves set stiff in sardonicus midway through some tragic item."},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Sound Of No-Face Laughing Something here should sound vaguely familiar; for the filmmakers are only reporting on the real-life formula. The toxic effects fiom which everyone-a a world-wide scale-pres- ently suffers, aren't just the peculiar high-tech demons of identifiable byproducts that can be duly isolated; the poisons that are smelted and packaged, refined and harvested, ejected and ingested incessantly through the sum-total of industrial living, work such thorough subversion of the immunology system (and in the process produce such unique and resistant ailments) owing to a synergistic interaction that simply couldn't be accomplished by each operating independently, i.e. in the manner of the standard linear model which mainstream medicine insists on imposing so as to focus on \"the\" reductive cause, the isolated irritant. Due to the same blinders which have served over time in accelerative synthesis of items for limited/profitable use or specialized effect, neither official science nor mainstream medicine have yet developed theoretical eyes adequate to view the dilemma in its proper dimension. It's for this reason the Joker, underworld master and crime czar of the Industrial Chemistry-set, can impart his lethal humor with invisible panache, with utterly silent and undetected effect. Only Batman seems able to see the gestalt, the Way of combination and synergistic reinforcement; everyone else appears to be looking in hypnotic left-brain fashion for the isolated factor, the irreducible particle, the underlying \"entity\". Only \"Batman\" sees it; he alone can figure it out. And why? The Unbelievable Unevenness Of Bat-Opposites By way of addressing ourselves to just that question, we should find it interesting that more than one \"major\" reviewer of Batman objected to the apparent imbalance in the respective portraits of Bruce Wayne and the Joker; the rictus-riddled Napier, they objected dody, was \"explained\" in his villainy far more thoroughly than the filmmakers apparently saw fit to \"explain\" the eponymous hero! But is this really so much a justified criticism, as it is a simple failure (common to critics) to take the actual story-premise into consideration on its own terms? Batman is the hero of this piece; after all, fellows, the movie is named after him. And in the story, he's a very mysterious figure to Gotharn's denizens. What motivates him to \"good\" (if it is indeed good) is not at all self-evident, nor is it supposed to be. In the story, he's an enigma. In contradistinction to this the Joker, evil as he is, is hardly an enigma. The only \"mystery\" hovering about him is how he does it, not why. No one really has any question about Negativity. It is taken for granted. Its cold self-serving is easy to assess. The filmmakers are-at least instinctively-correct. There is no mystery about this. Evil isn't just banal; it's actually more understandable to present sensibilities soaked in the neglect of wanton self-poisoning, than is the motivation or even the nature of good. (Remember, half the city thinks Batman sucks the blood of his criminal \"victims\", making the latter more implicitly sympathetic than he is.) Negativity is all too easy to come by; brooding, infantile self-serving is an all-too-easy reaction to the impasse created on all levels by that Negativity. No, Bruce Wayne's persona is not explained adequately by his remark \"bats are survivors\". Nor is it supposed to be. Since he's the focus of the movie in the explicit form of an enigma, he represents a challenge to the viewer to understand. All the clues are plainly given. We know he \"turned to crime-fighting because he witnessed the brutal murder of his parents\"; but we"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV have to dig into the Dream Psyche of this epic screen-symbolization in order to understand the extravagant dissociations in linear logic and developmental motivation involved in becoming a bat. (Well, have you ever considered what it takes to become a bat?) We must note then that bats \"see\" at night by a radar guidance-system. Analogically, Bruce Wayne \"sees\" into the machinations of evil (the \"nightside\") in a way no one else seems able. In another sense, the interior self-luminance or intuitive \"moonglow\" of a higher-dimensional intelligence is baffling to the common mind; that mind views the workings of such an intelligence as an impenetrable darkness, a perfectly opaque Mystery. Bruce Wayne is associated symbolically with precisely that darkness; he alone apprehends the \"non-linear\" means by which the Joker creates his deadly effect, because he too operates in the dark! In this sense, then, the filmmakers show us that Batman and the Joker operate upon the same, rarefied plane at opposite poles of the vertical divide; they are of comparable \"high intelligence\". They are a match in much the way that Holmes and Moriarty were a match, respectively untouchable at their parallel summits, each alone and apart in the wisdom-perfection of his particular polarity. (If there happened to be a crowd-packed continent of distance between them it would inevitably be as if the crowd mysteriously thinned, dreamily dispersed all the while they drifted uneningly together--nothing in the world really existing to effectually intervene, each being the sole real test of the other's verity unto utter death--so that the one was, alone, the other's warrant as unequalled distillate of the premise for which he stood.) This was brought symbolically alive, not only in the film (since the film draws on the background established in the comic), but especially on screen since the Wayne manor is portrayed as so immense, so foreboding and austere even Bruce seems uncomfortable in it at times-yet he corrects Vicki Vale that some of it is vety much \"him\". In this way we see a definite parallel; we are led to draw an inference in the,case of Bruce Wayne, where we were shown explicitly the imperious self-isolation of Napier. Batman is, in the perfection of his own polarity, as isolated by its comparative uncommonness as the Joker is isolated, by preference, in the uncommon coldness of his heart. Just consider for a minute: is Batman a \"regular guy\", a \"man of the people\"? Even Superman seems more gregarious ahd \"connected\" by comparison than Bruce Wayne. Like A Bat Out Of Heaven There is another side to this same observation: and it's here that we can clearly locate the means of distinguishing between the Caped Crusader and his greasepaint nemesis. There were those who (for example) objected to the last scene of the movie, preferring they'd simply cut to close at the point where the limousine pulls from the curb with Vicki Vale in the back seat on her way to meet Wayne. What such objection misses, because it doesn't operate on the same Ever-ready Bat-teries, is that the closing shot shows something as specific and important as anything that went before: we've seen that Bruce is as susceptible to love as anyone---after all, he's the one with the open heart; but we're emphatically shown that personal pleasure and private love-life must forever \"take a backseat\" in the committed breast of \"Batman\" (whatever that may be in its still mysterious darkness, hmrnm?). For we see him, in the end, outlined on a rooftop against the nightsky upon which glows, across a great full moon, the Batman insignia cast cloudward by the citizens' searchlight he'd given Gotham (and, in that giving, so sealed the primacy of his \"eternal vigilance7'-for, as he'd told V.V. earlier, \"it seems no one else can do it\")."},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Same As Dbvoub Devoyer Between Batman and the Joker, then, the assessment of the situation is much the same. What certain critics labelled their \"similar insanities\", thus inferring that their positions to either side of the positivelnegative ledger were arbitrary, is in fact a shared clarity of vision (which certainly looks mad from the midline muddle of majority consciousness, clinging to the conventional wisdom as if those preformed media-ingots could keep them afloat; what is in fact mad is adamant adherence to the mirage of rotted standards festering openly outside the workday gates of the leaking power plant, the befouling factory next to which the schoolground strangely bubbles with some indescrib- able ooze; what is in fact mad is fearing for the loss of jobs and a diminished tax-base when your childrens' hair is dropping out, and they bathe in the broth of bonecancer). Within such a similar \"clarity of vision\", however, the Joker is quite without peer in his dementia His response to the spreading vapors of anti-life enshrouding the city (to which his own loveless activity has contributed) is to become it. His unique answer to the predicament, only abetted by his having fden into the vat, is just an extension of the general way in which he was always moving but blown-up monumentally (and drawn to its logical extreme) by the exponent of cumulative effect-just as the general miasma propagated by sanctioned outlawry of the chemical companies is a gross materialization of \"the Joker's\" own morbidly self-serving psyche. The filmmakers, again whether by design or \"guided accident\", are showing something very important here that deserves a closer look. The Joker's \"solution\" to the encroaching atmosphere of death, is to become a. This is an acceleration of the whole predicament to another level, the addition of the dimension of consciousness, of intent. Note: the ghastly green entrepreneur who runs the factories and mills and vats of ubiquitous death, is not some myopic personality, a \"guy just like me\" only insuffciently informed; he is not someone who simply has to be educated to the inevitable consequences of a short-sighted activity; he isn't someone operating on compen- satory psychological mechanisms, or the reversible tack of rationalization. He isn't someone Lear-like in his preference for bad counsel or who simply refuses to see. He sees all too clearly; distorted perception is not his problem, nor is anything which can answer to some adjustive correction, the blandishments of refom. He loves what he does: do you hear this for what it is? This is the only way, ultimately, to account for the militarists and manufacturers who insist with the relentlessness of golems on secretly or openly irradiating the food you eat as well as the food your children and their own children eat. No explanation, no matter how reasonable by the logic of profitable self-interest, can otherwise adequately assess the character of the coolness with which the public's provided rationale for oxidizing its already devitalized foodstuffs; no exposure of complex plots to benefit, by loophole, from the \"fdout\" of private plutonium manufactury (no matter how factually firm) can account for the dimension of stark-staring madness behind it all. No, the \"problem\" of contemporary life has to be faced according to the real proportions informing it; and by measure of that scale it has to be confessed that the Joker-not your amenable Uncle Jack-showering money like Wall Street tickertape on the fume-filled streets of Gotham is clearly in charge of the Show. The Joker, then, beholds the unmistakable face of Death and decides to lead its Parade; Batman, on the other hand, while certainly seeing the same thing is hardly on the same, \"insane\" wavelength, as some critics have suggested, since from the beginning it's demonstrated that his intent is toward the protection and awakening of all the slumbering citizens, alerting them as well as the \"opposite element\" to the clear terms of the situation. And how does he do that? \"Tell them"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV about me,\" he commands a cringing hood he's cornered on a rooftop: get the word around, make them think-and think again. Does \"Blind As A Bat\" Ring The 01' Cathedral Belfry? Having heard certain critics' objections to other aspects of the movie, one can only inquire as to what said critics might possibly have been watching-in most cases it isn't even a matter of interpretation (the proper forum for differing) but of simply seeing what's up on the screen, and so noticing an actual point the filmmakers were trying to put across at precisely the place of blind objection. For example, one critic carped about the illogic of motivation or behavior, citing the scene in which the Joker showers money over packed Gotharn streets in his nightparade of poison-filled balloons; when the Joker is forced to stop, deprived of his balloons by the Batmobile, why--demanded the critic--doesn't the crowd jump the Joker and beat the tar out of him? Apparently the evidence of the senses is not enough for this mystic critic, who conjures away in one question the quite visible fact that the crowd is depicted, half-gassed like ambulatory zombies fiom Night of the Living Dead, still groping for the money! Doesn't it seem as if a specific point is being made here? Rather than the \"illogical motivation\" of flawed filming, the world disclosed upon the screen this reviewer saw was pointedly populated by dying humanoids clutching--out of the sheer automaticity of undissuadable habit-for the last-gasp buck. In fact this scene was a very telling '80s update of the '60s Magic Christian (remember the Terry Southern adaptation, with Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr?) in which that eccentric billionaire and \"Grand Guy, Guy Grand\" threw tons of money into a boiling vat of pig excrement in the middle of the city, after which the cosmopolitan citizens dutifully dived with squeals of oinkish delight It is noticeable (and so most-probably registers an intentional point) that in the comparable Baimun scene the crowd-noise is subdued; the filmmakers distinctly resisted the most obvious sort of depiction in which the volume would be turned full-blast in amplification of every greedy grunt and salacious cheer of the marching multitudes. Rather, it seems as if the crowd is already zombified before the poisonous jets are discharged; everyone has already absorbed a couple decades of deathdust, so that the game-show grovel after the dollars is now sheer reflex. This crowd is running on toxijied memories of piggishness. It doesn't \"turn upon\" the Joker and his men for the simple reason it doesn't see who poisoned everyone, although the culprits are right in the open; and it doesn't care. The last fog of semi-conscious life is fixed on the down-floating dollar bid. (This seems to be a pretty major point not to have noticed!) The whole ethos of the movie in fact is epitomized quite neatly during the scene in which the Joker, Prince of Philistines, is trashing a museum-ful of paintings; he sprays a portrait of Founding Father Washington with a dollar sign, thereby rendering George-the-first much more cozily familiar. Go Figure These Figures So why, then, are the crowds coming back and back to see this of all movies--and especially one itself so caught in those contradictions of \"going for the gold\" which it paints in pigments of purest caustic (what Bruce-Waynelrapid-fire-computerhead might sort the several ravages wreaked upon the ecosystem in the manufacture of but a single line of those plastic,"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV batwinged products being hawked to a public which sits down daily to a whole other gospel subliminRlly preached in the murky streets of Gotham?).

It is not too difficult to suppose, then, that (in light of the present 11 % hour crisis of the entire life-support system of this world) the actually peculiar, fiscally unsafe choices made by the creative and executive powers in charge of bringing us the 50th-anniversary celebration of Baman as well as the unprogrammatic \"programmed response\" of the public, reflects a submerged-obsessive acknowledgment that what has actually been captured here-face-off between Batman and his grinning nemesis included--is a documentary. What happens when (rather than sink the maximum millions into a serious \"epic\" such as-- days gone by--the fkkation of Ben Hur) the studios choose to sink comparable inflation- dollar millions into the filmization of a comic strip, is that you end up with a documentary.

Yeah, yeah, we know; it's the one everyone seems to have liked least, or would be if it weren't for the providential saviorship of Star Trek V (which we haven't seen yet ... waiting for the video, you know). Yes, we've heard all the objections, i-e. that it was just a composite of a few Star Trek t.v. episodes (The Changeling, The Doomsakay Machine, The Immuniry Syndrome), that its screen-result can be attributed to the mass-turnover-stew of writers hired and fued, walking on and walking off production (reading Steven King's account in Dame Macabre, we learn interesting things such as the fact that troglodytes were originally figured into a script variation, and that the inevitable Harlan Ellison did indeed make brief appearance at one point). But there have been any number of excellent books, plays, films and even epic poems based on or suggested by some slight source (we've seen the seminal Star Trek episodes, and though it's obvious large portions of Star Trek I were borrowed and combined fiom them, the film is exponentially superior to the simple additive product of the episodes). And the fact that a changing confusion of writerslcodtants actually served to shape the final product, doesn't in itself oblige us to find for the prosecution; sometimes, as in this case, the individually frzlgmental and unsatis- factory participation derived fiom a multitude only serves to make clearer a scarcely noted fact of all creative product, i.e. the actual Authorship prevailing in every case whether the work seem fair or foul. Indeed, the netporosiw and lack of conscious synchronization on the part of the haphazard participants in such a situation often creates (or at least may create) just those kinds of conditions in which the work is saved fiom sure distortions of headstrong personal intent; such a dz@sion of monolithic purpose can sometimes optimize the occasion for a subtle/invisible Direction, which receives minimum interference owing precisely to the absence of an overriding will. At least, it may be so in Star Trek I. For looking at it again, we may find under aegis of this renewed consideration (see the essay Movie and Dreams: The Qabala of Star Wms in T-Bird Issue No. 2) that in the case of the first Star Trek upon which was focused so much interest and anticipation, one of the subtler Images metaphorically catching the common condition in a cosmic context had been doorstep-delivered in mid-'79 (as usual, to be absorbed by conscious or subconscious systems depending on the room allowed by precisely that narrow-aperture lens of expectation). The importance of such optimal Images--even if we're unaware of them for what they are4ies in the fact that everything no matter how mundane is always crux of a total, Metacosmic context; everything is at all times the functional convergence-point of Infmity. As such everything"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV has an optimum signiJcance as well as the lesser or even \"trivial\" significances seeming to characterize anything under reign of the regular focus. At critical transition-points in mundane/cos- mic \"history\", the value of the resultant Change can be optimized only under regency of its greatest Context. It's for this reason that, considering the current universal convergence and climax of farflung factors the enveloping Term of Consciousness may be found \"working overtime\" manu- facturing the Images, Metaphors and sum Typologies to be stuffed into \"acceptable\" containers and passed off at the usual level thereby affording all conscious and subconscious strata the chance of absorbing some degree of the greater Whole in condensed form as they will, or are able. In this way, consciously accepted or not, critically \"acceptable\" or not, the very fact of its existence at the focus of a passionately-involved attention ensures that the resonant Value of these distilled Metaphors and archetypal images takes root somewhere in the psychic soil so as to become apart (albeit a scarcely noticed or understood part) of the ongoing motivational mechanics of existence at ground level. In Light of such light considerations, let's take a look once more at the Star Trek 1 plot. The Enterprise reassembles its crew to go after a mysterious electromagnetic Cloud of impossible girth apparently looming on a collision course with earth, and absorbing everything in its path4cluding Klingon and Federation vessels. Unflappable Spock even blows the Kolinahr (the ultimate Vulcan test of dispassionate logic) due to the distress call gone out in the galaxy in the Presence of this universal menace. It tunas out, re- member, that the ap proaching Field seems to envelop a highly intelli- gent Source-output. At the core of the field the Enterprise crew ultimately discovers an unmanned Voyager module from the 20th century, which, having been sent beyond its solar system, encountered a mechanical planet of highly evolved computer-intelligence; identifying the Voyager as one of its kind, the planetary intelligence outfitted it with cybernetic feedback capacity for fostering self-reflective mentality of its own type, and with such geometrically amplified ability the module was sent off as a sentient self-contained capsule to fidfill the original purpose for which it was programmed (technically that \"purpose\" was simply the completion of its binary code by the boys at Canaveral). This purpose, however, becomes self-consciously interpreted as the \"search for the Creator\", to find and unite with (i.e. fulfill the program of) Whatever that Creator turned out to be. The analogy with Spock's interrupted quest to attain Kolinahr is made explicit; the module becomes an all-absorptive energy field inadvertently \"destroying\" everything in its path due to its method- ology of trapping, \"digesting\" or dis-integrating into constituent elements so as to convert the \"analyzed\" codes into information-patterns of its amplifying memory banks. As it absorbs the infomation contained in all life-forms, inorganic bodies and machineries its Field enlarges and increases the available intensity with which it engulfs everything, amoeba-like, in its progressively inclusive path. The Enterprise crew discovers its \"intelligence\", indeed, by the exactingly precise and mathematically beautiful patterns of its information systems (synthesized and integrated through translation of all data in tenns of its magnetic energy-network, interpreting everything according to"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the unitive value of its Project-4.e. that of finding and uniting with the Creator). It's not too difficult to discern the altogether Faustian project of human intelligence (especially human intelligence divorced fiom the human soul--the Energy-cloud is after all ruthless, and its monomania is infantile). At first glance it seems to depict Western intelligence in particular, summarizing the saga of its separative development into a hypertrophied agency of analytic probes and multiplying tendrils, engaged in objectivist reductionism to the overwhelming Aim of its Alexandrian Ambition. It seems to depict the inevitable Western foray into the \"objective\" dimension altogether, in progressive domination and absorption of topological \"surfaces\" fortifying the subjective enclosure and enwrapped invulnerabiity of the ego-project-4.e. through conquest and conversion of all things into its own term, as ancillary agents of its voluminous Be-coming or portentous approach toward that ultimate Closure at which it will have secured ideal self-consonance with its own Creator-being. We may learn something important fiom the \"plot\" of this Star Trek: i.e. the actual purpose, project and underlying ontological structure of the Western world-view altogether. For it's precisely the very same \"Search for union with its Creator\" that secretly informs, as its governing abstract structure, the psychological configuration with which the Western \"scientific\" enterprise conducts itself. Its search, rather than taking the form of a yielding or spiritualized effort to surpass the confining perspective of nuclear self-insularity, instead affects the archetypal pattern of securing and enforcing that ultimate Closure through ideal incorporation of everything within it, until it takes on the all-inclusive proportions and illimitable dimensions of the Creator thereby satisfying the term of \"union\" by establishing aparallel identity of Being. The archetype of this great Movie Image, however, is more Relative even than this. For, if we look closer, we'll see that it isn't just the Western \"scientific\" turn of mind which is being depicted, critiqued and surpassed in the identifiable features of the oncoming Cloud. The method- ology of the electromagnetic juggernaut does not simply display the typically \"left-brain\" and thus Western emphasis on techniques of analysis, reduction, linear or piecemeal examination and verballabstract summary (or information-conversion). It exhibits equally the gestalt, right-brain and thus \"Eastern\" facility with whole-pattern values wherein information is rendered in resonant terms of a perceptual unity as \"music\" or \"light\". This emphasis follows a kind of \"inward\" tum, as with the standard Eastern or yogic methodology of merging the sensory-currents by withdrawal fiom fragmental \"exterior\" faculties into congruence with the mental field fiom which the several outward impressions take their being. Thus the Western, Faustian, piecemeal project of linear/sequential conquest that takes the scientific psyche into the depths of \"outer space\", ultimately meets head on and necessarily tends to turn into the counterpart project of the Eastern psyche, wherein the Space which is ultimately explored has an inevitable Conscious Dimension (cf. Kubrick's 2001, which makes the same unstated pohit that the further we stretch outwardly the more \"impossible\" and contradictory things become in strict physical terms, 'ti1 we solve for that contradiction through the paradox that \"furthest out\" is the threshold of ultimate inwardness and apJychic transformation of form). Through the uniting Imagery of this Star Trek saga then, we may begin to see that the \"inward\" or Eastern yogic Way is similarly insular and egoically encapsulated in its point-of-de- parture; it is part of the same project as the \"Western\" scientific enterprise. Their \"individual\" methods are inseparable, and eternally suggest one another as one side of a coin enforces the existence of the opposite."},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The yogic or inward-turning Eastern project is similarly deracinating, it deliberately severs fiom the emotions and wanner related dimensions of the human psyche in order to engage its purely mental project of progressive \"d~cations\" and inclusive syntheses, through serving the artificial singleness of meditative self-enclosure. Iti operative field isn't based on the \"body\" or plane of spacetime commonality, but on the sealed energy-bubble of the psyche nosing through the nuances of its subtler subjective scents so as to sniff out the secret of its soul-being (by interpretation, sole-being). Scent or odor is precisely the sensory value operating between physical and subtle existence (the olfactory lobes being correlated, through acupuncture meridians, with the basal centers and energy-plexuses mediating cognitive keys out of which the \"physical\" dimension is aligned). Scent encodes the deepest most persuasive physical memories; it's an invasive or penetrant quality having ultimate effect on the gastric plexus (stimulating appetite, causing revulsion etc.) and carries with it a deep impression of coinvolvement through the \"immediate\" field of physical touch owing to its visceral character. At the same time, its pronounced figuring in the \"spiritual\" areas of religion and meditation through the use of incense etc., indicates the ethereal phase of the same faculty as a medium conveying a visceral impression in subtle form, \"lofting\" the earthiness of a given quality on a \"current\" into the head (in the same way incense renders a resin into plumes of etherealized smoke rising toward the focusing upper arches of the chapel). We rhapsodize upon the character of odor in order to indicate the existence of distinct symbolic reference to this East/West psychic project as hidden within the Star Trek plot. When the Deltan lZia comes aboard the Enterprise, we see immediately how this bald femme fatale monopo- lizes the collective male attention. NOW, cheating just a little we refer you to the novelization of the movie in which an important explanation is given that doesn't survive last edit of the film, here it's explained the Deltan female exudes a particularly erotic fragrance fkom the glands on meeting anyone new, and that the character of this odor isn't so much a fkenzied stimulation as a means of allowing the Deltan to command attention, to draw all (male) eyes to a single focus. Here we have a most economic means of depicting the Eastern methodology and mental orientation. For note that Ilia, actually played by a Hindu, is characterized in the movie as being celibate. No more concise (if cryptic) way of encoding the whole Eastern methodology in symbolic form can be imagined; for what's strongly suggested is the common yogicpractice of sublimating the sexforce (the exterioriz- ing sensory energy-current summed in the sexually stimulating olfactory gland), awakening its agency to the degree of drawing the ordinarily-diffused attention--the multiple male principals--on an initial stimulus of desire and forging it into a unitivelconvergent concentration converting desire to active will (again, the \"desiring\" males turned in unison toward the female who consolidates those units of attention into her single, commanding Presence, or will). That will is not itself then used for sexual purposes; Ilia is, specifically, celibate. The novelization further informs that the sexual aspei of the glandular secretion wears off, leaving the desired effect of establishing the command of attention which was required. Here then is the equal representation of the traditional Eastern psyche, come aboard the Enterprise in the form of the lovely albeit bald (i-e. celibate) Ilia There is an unconsummated or unenforceable love between her and Decker (the right-brain, holistic or gestalt perceptions and the left-brain analytic cognitions). Note that, between the two prototypes, Ilia and Decker (East and West) it is Ilia or the East who ultimately becomes converted wholIy into the energy-codes and information patterns"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV belonging to the omnivorous VGER (VGER is the self-consciously rendered name of the Voyager, don't forget; this is an especially nice-if largely unnoticed!--touch since the module is Voyager 6; 6 in Qabala is the Sephirah of the ego-soul or self-center Tiphereth, the tselm or \"image\" of the self-reflective ego-being; and the Module names itself--quite obviously--through the reflective device of self-observation whereby it \"sees\" the worn remnant of letters on its outside thus obtaining its objective identity in good, ego-modelled fashion). Ilia is wholly absorbed by and converted into the massive gestalt energy-field of the oncoming Cloud, thereby becoming its spokesperson in cybernetic duplication, or sterile parallel, of the form of ''human\" being. This is all symbolically appropriate, and by interpretation quite telling. For of the two psychic methodologies, East and West, the Western is the most objectively distancing and intrudes the greatest degree of mutual estrangement between observer and observed, being obsessively fixed upon the objective or \"separate\", exterior dimension conceptually defined and artificially enforced; whereas the Eastern methodology, while if anything more life-negating than the Western and as subjectively self-enclosed, enforces that enclosure through contrastive affinity with the ideal (symmetrically self-neutralizing) holism of the psychic field-coordinates of Being, experienced through right-brain emphasis as aperceptual immediacy. The methodology itself involves a deeper, if specialized, intimacy; it requires a unifica- tion of the sensory-currents in congruence with their common field (rather than their unitary convergence in focal resolution of a defined \"object\", reflected fiom that field as a fleeting eidolon of its operations). Such inevitable intimacy and special identification through the holism of the field, is termed in the East samadhi. One \"becomes\" that upon which samadhi has been made. It is Ilia who, as representative of the Eastern psyche, makes \"samadhi\" with VGER through being wholly absorbed by, and translated into, VGER's ancillary information-patterns (the FX geometries and panoramic kaleidoscopes depicting the interior of VGER's magnetic mass should be immediately identifiable to anyone having Third Eye meditative experience to the \"black light' 'degree of brilliant phosphene fields and web-like symmetries shining in the subtle lobe. Compare also the designs of the Freida HarrisIA. Crowley Thoth Tarot card deck, especially the Harris paintings of the Star and World Trumps). Note also that Spock (another essentially-Western representative in the objectivity of his idealized logic) cannot \"make samadhi\", i.e. \"mind-meld\" with VGER, reinforcing what we've just noted regarding differences in methodology and result of the respective hemispheric ap- proaches. Lest anyone yet doubt the deeper cogency of the most \"far-out\" (i.e. metaphysical) interpretation of the film, behold the manner in which, after her mortal \"samadhi\" with VGER Ilia becomes cosmicized, her image gigantically enlarged as if she held the nightsky as a Galaxy all her own. At her throat is a glowing, crystalline orb. This strongly suggests a \"yogic\" interpretation for the whole event; the throat Chakra is the threshold zone through which attention crosses to \"higher dimensions\" of abstract perceptual Unity in the spiritual-energy fields. Having established thematic presence of the whole Symbolic venture of hemispheric psyches, East and West, and correspondingly the hemispheric histories of the brain, we may proceed to the Greater ground belonging to the Conscious Point of this film. For in the end, as VGER approaches earth and the apparent rendezvous-Omega of mergence with the Creator, the central"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV module in its dawning wisdom-consciousness realizes there can be no denouement along the trajectory of its asymptotic continuum. A march \"toward\" in progressively inclusivelmore com- prehensive synthesis along a directional mow, can in itself contain no resolution. There is no tern in a sequence of tenns that can satisfy the linear equation formed by their consecution. The abstract \"perfection\" of VGER's computations in triangulating an increasingly exact estimate of the Creator's \"location\" seems suddenly and self-evidently empty; the strategy of achieving perfect parity in progressive or additive mode seems suddenly bankrupt, manifestly only capable of producing another limited term to be adjusted in a still-more-comprehensive equation..so VGER deliberately cuts its electrical leads, when about to receive transmission of the binary equation from its \"parent\" program. Instead of some ultimately sterile number-denouement VGER's intelligence is suddenly seen as psychically unified in a connective field embracing the two \"hemispheric\" representatives- the energy information/pattern version of Ilia awakened already to her memory-prints of human love involving Decker, and the gushingly human Decker himself. These two bioenergetic poles are then united through their mutual connection in VGER as ultimate reintroduction of the value of Love to the complex calculus of the general psychic equation. The arid, ultimately impoverished \"linear\" advance of mathematical emptiness is curtly interrupted, not completed but simply abandoned, dropped as an irresolvable proposition and wholly supplanted by a brilliant mind-body union, a global instantaneous self-apprehension through the unitive Ground of Love and the sublimelmetacosmic Hierogamos of male-female hemispheric polarities. In this way VGER's ultimate union or rejoining with the Creator doesn't apotheosize some general strategy to dominate the materia of existence, as with the intelligence of Western science; or to achieve immaculate nonbiological Identity-by-recognition in the prearranged \"appro- priateness\" of a particular term, as when the yogin identifies the pinnacle-attainment through some interior image or anticipated form. VGER neither \"conquers\" earth and the \"biological forms\" ultimately, as just more raw material in its path; nor does it embrace the scholasticism of the abstract formula (the closing codes) in \"celibate\" preference over the \"biological units\" previously viewed as some \"infestation\", a disease of the Enterprise's austere machinery-perfection. Rather we are given to understand, through analogic Echo of the scenario, that any such abstract key or coded formula is simply a symbol; in itself it only represents the Completion, the satisfactory Union of the motivating antinomies of Being. That union can't be achieved in or through the \"mind\" as a separated reality, any more than introducing the image of a hungry man to the \"resolving formula\" found in a recipe book can satisfy the real hunger of whomever makes the analogical attempt. The practical difficulty in understanding this that haunts all human philosophy, derives from the subtle sense that Mind (the noetic dimension of Being) is the real root of physical existence; this grasped, either through ponderous Thomasinian tracts or mathematic bon mots of recent physics (actually dragging physicists to the neo-Platonic verge of asking again whether the math isn't the reality itself, rather than a proximate calculus of the modes of reality) the common tendency is to crave withdrawal into the mind, as if the body were an excrescence of that Ideal rather than legitimate \"conjugative\" expression of it. Mind in its dry purity as a thetic \"crystal\" of self-resolving form seems literally to hold out the Ideal of Being preferred over the shadow \"cavewall\", or Maya of the Eastern tradition. In this way the totalizing expression of biophysical life as which consciousness practi-"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV cally exists, tends to be shunned as an ungov- ernably \"irregular\" vehicle of plasmatic ooze (the \"biological Kirk-unit\" looked upon as a parasitic infestation of the austerely-perfect Starship). Physical life is either to be \"quit\" (as with Eastern withdrawal of the sensory currents, or the Western drive to abandon nest-fouled Spaceship Earth) or it's to be conquered, domi- nated and domesticated to pure precision or \"robotic\" responsiveness of an (ideally) predict- able sort. In thus withdrawing into the \"supe- riority\" of the Mind-realm either by outer mathematics or inner concentration, both East and West try to cheat the totalizing (messy, ungovernable) context of the psycho-biological whole through which all such effort takes place; they attempt alike to retire into some ultimately exclusive truth of the Mind as overtly Symmet- ric void-resolution of a geometrically precise type (thereby ignoring the equal presence of Mind as the particularized contexts polarizing roughldefining contrasts of the living perceptual field that become the very extended occasion of all such mind-born Grail search). At this point in the consideration we should recall a passage fiom the Ra material- cf. issues No. 3 and No. 4 TNTC-in which the Ra entity (communicating fiom precisely those abstract-noetic heights) proclaims that the Crea- tor uniquely enters through the feet. The feet are the organic correspondents of the physical or earth-dimension itself, as extensions of the low- est chakra or muladhara plexus located at the perineum. This mystifLing observation, that the Creator abides in and enters through the feet, can be understood by refening to our Cosmogonic description (What Is 'Christ Consciousness '?) wherein we note that Absolute-divine Identity sacrificially identi$es with and through Its mani- festing patterns so as to allow the anisometric life of their most physically \"opaque\" and thus convincingly delimited expressions. Thus we find the Creator immanently indwelling the very"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV midst of Its creation, just as VGER finds itself drawn unerringly back to earth in order to hail the home of the Creator-source. In this way it may be recognized how real union with the Creator has to be achieved through the whole of Its Being, not through some specialized phase or aspect of It. The prolific messy worlds of apparent, teeming irregularity and fertile imbalance (i.e. the \"spiral\" worlds) enjoy equal status, as ideo-form expressions of Being through the \"perspective\" of Infjnity, with the Ideotype wholes of symmetrized Perfection fiom the geometries of which they functionally derive (i.e. the \"circle\" worlds of the Light or Heaven realms). VGER's union with the Creator as it approaches Earth thus takes place as a marriage of the total psycho-biological Being exemplified by the sacred integration of idealized form (Ilia) and the \"man of earth\" (Decker). We are strongly reminded of the ground-breaking philosophy of yogi-saint Sri Aurobindo, who declared that the upward arc of concentration toward the abstract remoteness of the non-manifest Creator-identity was not in itself sufficient, nor did it warrant assumption of a completed practice; that the fulfilling cycle was accomplished in return of Consciousness along the downward arc of manifestation (the fiontal or vagus axis) so as to combine and unite It again with Its fully extended fields of created existence, awakening the whole of manifestation to Its eternally indwelling Presence. It's for this reason Aurobindo's philosophy incorporated, significantly and almost uniquely, a primary veneration and representative embodi- ment of the Mother (the living, awakened female as the Apotheosis of physical consciousness and Creative Being). Kirk, of course, goes off on one of his famous filibusters at the closeout, ranting on about the human adventure and otherwise giving every indication that, like the inevitable greater part of his audience, he hasn't understood a thing that's been going on.

Since Dorothy is knocked unconscious we can literally assume we're skrying terms of the deep mind, when the screen bursts into the hallucinatory colors of Oz. The funnel of sleep has dropped her down inside a set of swirling conditions rendering their own extensive World of implication, of which moreover she's a central participant, a key figure-even though she's apparently an Innocent born of mere accident, fresh on the scene without prior complicity. Exactly as in the Dream of Life Itself, the protagonist-innocent utterly ignorant of the whole affair and simply wanting to go home, is nonetheless informed she's responsible for a death; not a second in Oz and she's already violated taboo ground ... she's slain the sister of the most sinister element in the whole Land, the wicked Witch of the West--and all because the very vehicle by which she came to Oz seems to have set plunk on the pate of the devilish daughter of the East. If the Eastern witch could be considered \"bad\", Glynda the Good Witch informs Dorothy helpfully, then her surviving sister (sure to be out instantly for revenge) is twice the trouble at the very least. A Slippery Situation May we assume here the general attitude of helpfihess of the Good Witch and gently suggest that, dreamwise, the East represents the occult dimension of reality, the inner planes, the nonmanifest worlds of the so-called Unconscious from which Dorothy had just \"materialized\" in her \"flying house\"4.e. the prototype body pattern of the astral-flight Soul Vehicle. Therefore the unknown \"threat\" posed by that mysterious Dimension of Being has already closed on her, before-the-fact, precisely in conjunction with her waking up to this new incarnation in the Land of Oz. , The Witch of the West therefore signdies, as does the West itself, the field of exteriorily, the ovedmanifested planes of matter and all the potential mischief of which the material phase is capable. By simply opening her eyes to the color and surreal texture of the \"manifest\" field of reality (which, remember, is but the dream of another, scarcely remembered but deeply-longed-for Existence) Dorothy seems to have \"escaped\" the implied perils of a Being about which she wasn't even aware; but only to be delivered up to the characteristic perils of this materialized plane proper, signified by the Western Witch of Oz. In very Kafka-like fashion, Dorothy has awakened wide-eyed to an unknown world wherein, by that very awakening, she's already responsible for having \"occulted\" an entire Being--and apparently has to answer for that inadvertent impropriety to Another. The key at once to her protection and her imperilment, (and ultimately to her Return) seems to lie in her possession of the curious Ruby Slippers-+ style of footwear the Western Witch appears for some reason to particularly covet. And what, in the lexicon of dream-logic, could the Ruby Slippers possibly be? If we remember that, having imprisoned Dorothy in her castle the witch tries avidly to tear away the slippers only to be startlingly burned, we have all the clue we need. Red is the color of fire, and of blood. These \"slippers\" represent then the very, fiery energy and Lifeforce of the spiritual current that becomes ensouled (or en-soled, you know) as the nuclear code of physical polarization at the perineum, and by extension through the legs and feet: the Sakti or Sekinah (see the Star Wars review) in either Hebrew or Hindu traditions is referred to as the Divine Footstool.

And they belonged, formerly, to the Eastern witch-4.e. the principle of nonrnanifestation, the \"occult\" or hidden side of things- notice we don't see the face of the Eastern Witch, only her feet or the lowest form of her semi-manifestation.) And Dorothy is continuously cajoled to \"surrender\" the Ruby Slippers to the Negative (i.e., succumb to the conventional threats and enticements of physical existence by allowing the precious Lifepower to be engaged in the spells and distractive delusions of that realm). The Witch, it is obvious, wishes to use themagical potency of this twinkletoe-power toward her own self-serving ends. Of course it would be a lot easier for Dorothy to surrender-if it wasn't for the fact she's propelled onward by an unremitting purpose, a potent recollection: she has to return Home.

No Parking-Validation In The Tow-Away Zone Of Oz As in the proper gestalting of any good dream, the supplementary characters and supporting cast can be considered aspects of the protagonist, in this case the \"dreamer\" Dorothy. Thus the tin man, scarecrow and cowardly lion represent not only emphasized traits drawn through specific personalities fiom the general spectrum of psychic types and tendencies; they mirror significant portions of the subject-mind through which the experience of Oz is narratively reflected. Keeping this in mind, do you know how the tin man got his heart, the scarecrow got his brain, and the cowardly lion his courage? Why of course! we hear some of the readership leap brightly at the recollection: the Wizard gave those things to them, in the respective forms of a ticking clock, a diploma fiom a diploma-mill, and a medal-of-honor. If in fact you quickly answered this way, we must beep the null-buzzer; in truth the Wizard's little token awards were trinkets of a parody quite telling of human psychology, if we but look a little closer. For such clearly superfluous baubles were precisely not the means whereby the trio acquired their longed-for traits. They had already achieved those coveted attributes, brought them to blossom fiom their earlier absentation in the seedbed of simple potential. (It's not so much that one doesn't \"possess\" the desired traits as that one hasn't drawn them out yet in the only way they can be accurately \"tested for\", i.e. in actual trials, tribulations, dangerous effort and unremitting work.) Having passed through those trials and succeeded out of love for Dorothy, the group had manifested the respective traits most coveted-which is the sole way the presence of such traits may be secured, i.e. in actual expression. The Wizard's \"awards\" come as parodic anticlimax, and point out the distinct difference between the way in which the ego seeks to rat~fL the presence of"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV idealized traits projectively presumed to \"fulfill it\", and the manner in which such values are actually realized and fulfilled. The ego looks at some such value as \"courage\", \"brains\" or \"heart\" as apossession to which it would ideally correspond by consensual vdidation; thus the ego's basic project is to be ratified, to be confirmed by the general domain of Other in the form of a significant Authorization. Astute analysis shows that, underlying everything, this is the whole of what comprises the ego's compelling project, its continuous drive through the hollow self-tunnel of \"incompletion\" or existential inadequacy. And yet the domain of Other (the totality-of-the-world that seems beyond the personal \"prehensility\" of willed regulation) is in fact quite powerless to confer the required values, in the very way the Wizard was exposed in his perfect ineptitude. The developed values of the Soul are not a gratis boon of \"Saktipat\", of some wizardly conferral of energy-amplification; nor are they obtainable as correct answers to a catechistic recital. \"I'm a very good man\", says the Wid, \"it's just that I'm not a very good Wizard.\" Yet in a sense he performs his function perfectly: he is a very good Wizard indeed, he is the wonderful Wid of Oz: for when Dorothy and the companions come to him to inquire how to obtain what they want (with Dorothy's desire to return home foremost) the Wizard imperiously \"refuses\" to confer their aims as gratis gifts but instead sends them off with an insistence that theyfizIfill conditions; he commands that they do the impossible, go right into the heart of what they were scrupulously trying to avoid and obtain the wicked Witch's very broomstick. And it's only through this most severe of trials, concerning matters of no less moment than Life and Death, that the little group finds the courage, heart and intelligence in compassionate camaraderie to face what they just couldn't face, and accomplish what-without a Wizard's ensorcelling help-they just couldn't accomplish. Glyndathe Good Witch, don't forget, reveals the secret of the Ruby Slippers; it is through them that Dorothy could have returned home any time she wished! Indeed, it's through her experience that Dorothy is subsequently able to exclaim to Aunt Em and the hired hands \"if it isn't here, right here at home, it isn't anywhere.\" Do we hear a distinct spiritual reverberation? Do we hear a persistent if paradoxical refrain, reiterated down the halls of time fiom Saints and Roshis right through to Krishnamurthi, Ramana Maharshi and \"Wei Wu Wei\" to the effect that reality is already Whole, Being is complete-and-perfect before the fact and there is nothing we can do to \"complete\" it, nothing we can add to it or subtract fiom it that will make it anything other than what it eternally Is? Befooled By A Dream Alarmclock It's precisely this declaration, delineating the \"awakened\" point of view, that has led to the sorry spectacle of quite ordinary egos attempting to capitalize on the apparent effortlessness of the Illuminated Re- by forthwith \"dropping everything\", proclaiming their own purchase on sublime Completion and then (still suffering of course fiom full commitment of Identity to all the partial/preferential profiles of ego-identification cast in the cliched psychological mold) laboring in the pseudo-spontaneity of a queasy \"fieedom\" to elicit some secret confirmation, some tacit or extravagant validation fiom the displacing field of Other for that \"awakening\" which tosses in persistent selfdeluding sleep. Even many teachers of such a spiritual \"truth\", precisely those such as Krishnamurtbi et al., have not clearly noticed an inbuilt trick of that truth, i.e. the refractory fact that the complexes of common ego-consciousness characteristic of human psychology at this stage of development are"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV instances of the overspreading Tree of that Truth in seed-form. The seed can't arbitrarily drop the conditions of its encapsulation and proclaim itself equivalent to the oak. It must be planted in the whole Ground of that Truth, fed and watered, tended and nurtured, cultivated and cared for. A process of germination has to take place, and the mode of time is precisely the device Eternity employs to draw that sapling presence into Conscious continuity with the \"absolute instantaneity\" of Its own all-pervasive Being. Yes, technically Dorothy could have \"gone home any time\", for \"home\" is the Present In-dwelling of Consciousness. It is irnmediate/unmediated Awareness of the absolute conformance of everything with the Self-presence of Consciousness--the intimate \"hearth-and-home\" identity of everythmg in smooth unity with and as the Occasion of Conscious Self-presence. Yet to really know that Truth as its Living Ekpression (i.e. in order to really \"wake up\" back in Kansas rather than experience a pseudo-awakening only to find you're still in the bewildering Oz of your ordinary, excruciating psychology) you have to have employed the shoes properly! You have to have been tested in the persistence with which you valued and protected them, honored them and enlisted them steadfastly in a dedicated movement toward home; you can't have misused them, or surrendered them in a trade of convenience to the Negative call. It's through that steadfast persistence and focused undissuadable direction in your employment of the Ruby Slippers (i.e. the fiery life-force of the mindbody pattern effectively focusing and \"locking in\" Conscious Whole-being to the partial perspective of the material Mystery, the manifest Land of Oz) that you develop those values, cultivate the required qualities whereby the defective Negative may be overcome. For you cannot simply plop down and arbitrarily declare you're home. This much we do learn fiom the Wizard of Oz; the Negative stands effectually in the way. The \"evil\" is in effective control of the Land in the. same way the negatively-polarized psyche of common ego psychology lays exclusive claim upon the magical powers and spiritual properties locked in those Ruby Shoes! When however the very demanding and even \"impossible\" work is done, the necessary values of Soul will have been developed and demonstrated: the lion will indeed be courageous; the scarecrow will indeed be intelligent; and the tin man, yes, the tin man will have a heart of which he can be certain, for it will most certainly be broken. When the Being is thus integrated, vivified and drawn to an intensification through which it's capable of facing the Negative on Its own soil for the sake of \"another\", then it may be that the Ruby Slippers (always technically capable of Restoring Dorothy to her Home since they continu- ously stand on unific Ground) will in fact beficnctionally fit to effect that Recovery. And no \"magical conferral\" in authoritative Validation by the Other-expertise of a Wizard, is at all needed to accomplish this ultimate feat of Sublime Magick. Here then is the Way in which one merits the longed-for, Motherly care of that One who awaits, Who is There all along, the gracious Aunt Em; for Aunt Em (Em is full spelling of the letter M) is simply A.M. The morning, the dawn, the natural or spontaneous awakening of the Sunrise. And it is also of course AM, the declarative Presence of that which Is, i.e. Eternal Being. One last interesting thing: since this reviewer is now forced to confess he's never actually read the Wizard, he must ask on the basis of his viewing of the movie just who had been so curiously prescient, so perfectly predictive? Was it L. Frank himself, or the screenwriters or LeRoy or Garland or Victor Fleming? For take a closer look: the Witch seems to prefigure the foul design of a diabolic intelligence visited some decades later upon the real world; she issues her plague upon"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the lowering skies of OZ, ded by winged monkeys--and listen carefully! there's a curious line that simply hangs there in the movie like a severed nerve, for there is no followup or further reference in the story: the allusion seems to stand alone, an almost uncanny insertion (perhaps there were scenes of continuity that were simply cut out for \"time\"; but the allusion itself was then curiously preserved, as if by oversight). For as the monkey-emissaries of the green witch loft into a sky progressively darkened with their proliferating presence, she cryptically commands: \"send my insect ahead to take the fight out of themw(!). In light of such unprecedented modem plagues as AIDS (alleged to have originated with the Afiican green monkey) and the concomitant general weakening of the immunology system, the Witch's declaration seems to shadow a far-reaching design for 'a kind of Negative conquest.

'901 A Channeling Handbook, by Carla L. Rueckert by Monty Tyson When you turn to the medical profession in need of duodenal treatment you'll turn to a gastroenterologist and, preferably, the best in the field; when you turn to atomic matters you'll turn to specialization of the physicist, and ideally you'll consult a \"Heisenberg\" or \"Fermi\"; when you turn in consideration of the subject of physical anthropology you'll be well advised to study a \"Leakey\", in the field of social anthropology a \"Margaret Mead\" etc. Similarly, when you turn to the subject of channeling you'd be equally well advised to consult the best that genre has to offer. In keeping with T-Bird policy we refer you to the finest in a given field of \"new age\" concern; as we've said before, the Mework of that policy is to act as a kind of consumer advocate or even metaphysical ombudsman to pair the specific requirement with the highest exemplification of the genre. Such recommendation isn't the equivalent of \"your reviewer Monty's\" endorsement of the given field itself; indeed as we've had ample opportunity to see in past features (UFOs, Channeling and the PositiveLNegative Realms etc.), there's a distinct editorial reserve where it comes to the category of \"channelingw-for instance-altogether. Indeed a few (very few, actually) have expressed their consternation that we take so dim a view of the subject as a whole, considering it's such a \"major\" topic on the new age front; for those, this review will help round their understanding of the perspective from which we approach the subject. Yet, since we recognize that regard for certain topics (channeling, crystals, brain-machines etc.) will surely persist in the \"seeking\" public we don't turn our backs on those honest expressions of the true diversity of \"means\" by which the Soul affects to approach its conciliation with Itself; rather we offer a certain filtering function whereby those most sincere in their approach--and therefore most attentive to our sincerity--may take advantage of our higherdimensional \"product testing\" and move by direct recommendation to the best available source(s) of the given genre. Without hesitation, then, we present to our readership a brief review of A Channeling Handbook written by the greatest channeler of all time, Carla L. Rueckert. How can old Monty make such a claim? How dare he state something so baldly? It's not that hard to pan the stream even where there's an apparent swamp of channeled stuff not only from the \"fad\" of recent history but records ancient and all-but-sacrosanct from long-term wear. The Old Testament prophets for example, virtually channelers-all, while certainly qualifying for consideration by sheer power of their (characteristically) fiery communications nonetheless lack-let's face it--the virtue of profuse, insightful information rationally stated and metaphysically plausible which some of the better channeled communications of modem origin"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV clearly exhibit (making these latter-day conch-calls stand, by any reasonable evaluation, a plateau above any ex cathedra invectives rained over cruder contexts of some \"Sodom and Gomomh\"). We can, therefore, without remorse, strike off a whole zone of metaphysical broadcast as belonging to a past-imperfect tense, critically limited in quality of the intercepted \"content\" (Jehovah-generated or not); we may consider the general present of latter-day channeling as comparitively \"ripe\" (fortunately you can't see Monty blanch in writing these words). Out of the modem pool of channeled materials then, perhaps beginning with the disputed Mahatma letters of Blavatsky that kicked off the \"modem era\" in the 1800s, we may quickly winnow the weeds since virtually all such communications parcel out into clear expression of a telltale density and kind of \"academy\" within such density, in the hierarchy of dimensional wholes. (For a fuller definition of the \"densities\" consult the OctoberMovember two-part essay referred to above, Channeling, UFOs etc.; the term \"density\" was highjacked from Rueckert's Ra Material itself, although available works on the subject from that source don't seem to explain the concept-per se--to any satisfactory extent. The concept of the densities however, was taught as the \"multidimensional order of worlds and levels\" in close conformance to the sense of the Ra material, by the teachers of Southern Crown-M and MT--long before the raft of Ra ever drifted out to its reading public; so the term was subsequently drafted into service of Southern Crown's long-standing description whereas the characterization itself [as encountered for instance in the two-part essay cited above] originates strictly fiom initiated understanding that anticipated the Ra material by years and which can't be found-in any case--in the spare statements published fiom that Source.) It is then arelatively simple matter to sort such communications, from counsel of initiated perspective, into groups belonging entirely to 4th density or 5th whether Negative or Positive in character (this present focal framework wherein we dwell apparently conjunct the \"earth-sphere\", remember, is 3rd density in composition currently making the bumpy transition to 4th). There is some channeled communication moreover which is just the gushing expression of 3rd density timehpace or discarnate consciousness enthusiastically transmitting the relative features of \"libera- tion\" obtained by dying alone, and so \"gained\" by simply showing up (inevitably) on the far-side of the spacetime horizon without any further insight drawn through transformative work. This is typically the dream world disclosure of the mind-minor effect experienced (in the \"decompression antechamber\" of the Astral realm) by souls only dimly aware their \"reality\" is composed of memory impressions projected on the insulating wall of their own auric eggs, therefore often taking expression as the half-light declaration \"you create your own reality\". Since most such communications fall flush into these categories (becoming progres- sively easier to discern and correctly classify the further along the path one moves, through initiatic stages corresponding by soul harmonics with successive densities), the rarest and most valuable communication will naturally be located in any transmission demonstrably \"beaming\" fiom the narrow-band channel of 6th density (here the parallel initiatic stages traversed through constant ground-focus of 3rd density, become deceptive; whereas there is the rare personified realization of a 7th stage adeptship available in and through this 3rd density existence, such realization on the part of any being necessarily correlates with mid-to-higher degrees of 6th density; and such a realized being corresponds, by virtue of that initiation and by the \"graduation process\" of physical death, to the 6th densi ty... inconceivably remote to the average of 3rd stage consciousness composing the mass of this 3rd density. There is no 7th density being who properly takes embodiment in 3rd density;"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the \"highest\" an incamate being can be is 6th density, corresponding-according to degree of initiation-either to phases of the 6th or 7th stage when located in our common 3rd density milieu. This is due to the fact that 7th density belongs to an order of consciousness no longer \"individuated\" or \"personified\" in the sense that we may understand such mode). Since the rarest and correspondingly most valuable communication from a discarnate source is going to proceed from 6th density, we may assume once we've located such a source that we have, ipso facto, located most likely candidate for \"greatest all-time channeling\". There is in fact only one major 6th density source-communication in all the available channeled literature, ancient or modem. Suddenly the most-likely candidacy becomes simple to discern. For the Ra material is, indeed, the single such available source. Critical comparison of that source with all others, singly or collectively, demonstrates beyond doubt that the Ra material exhibits the most thorough-going, consistent, ranging and deeply accomplished metaphysic available from any channeled origin (placing it \"up there\", automatically, with the greatest philosophical expressions of any kind). From internal evidence and direct deposition of the parties involved in drawing such narrow-band communication, there was a factor of difficulty correspondingly great and proportion- ally calibrated to the greatness of the Source. Carla L. Rueckert was herself the actual channel, and it is her book on channeling which we have before us in review. Old Religious Ideals Obviate the Negative It is exactly the degree of diaculty experienced by the participants of the Ra channeling, which sets that work apart and demonstrates how the art of channeling in its highest form is inseparable from true spirirualpractice. It is precisely that degree of difficulty requiring a redoubled dedication and continually-renewed senice orientation that obliged the participants to pass con- stantly beyond themselves. It's for this reason we may confidently turn to the voice of Carla Rueckert in her Channeling Handbook as the practiced expression of one who became, through such initiatic ordeal, not only a \"seasoned professional\" but the exemplification of that higher develop- ment potentially available through one of the \"spiritual\" or \"metaphysical\" means currently presenting itself on the new age hnt. In codiontation with the challenge of giving \"birth\" to an Expression of such (normally) unmanageable mane, the participants were faced with the implicit choice of dropping it altogether or developing into a higher order of their own being. For it became quickly apparent that a new uncustomary intensity, an uncommon degree of personal integration, vigilance, group unity and individual initiative was required even to contemplate dealing with so delicate a brand of communication rife with hazard and opportunity for enor. As a case in point re this style of initiatic development we may refer to Carla's self-characterization as a practicing Christian; we may note that, while admittedly subscribing to all that this implies (the personal saviorship of Jesus Christ etc.) she is canny to acknowledge such identity as a key in the creation of a \"magical personality\". Taking her cue from studies in occult literature, Carla identifies the magical personality as a type of \"ideal of integration\" suitable for the assumption of a more coherent, intense and generally alert version of one's ordinarily \"weaker\" identity-expression. Her \"Christian persona\" furnishes her an emotional reference, and provides a point of orientation about which she can integrate the values that must be brought to bear in mostcoherent form so as to possess a suitable (cognitive) vehicle whereby to test, challenge and identify all which is liable to arise in the course of drawing upon an ambitious magnitude potent to"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV attract the attention of the widest range of \"otherworld\" powers. For Carla the \"Christian reality\" is certainly no gimmick, a means to an end; her sincere love of Christ and devotion even to the most mundane elements of church work serve her well as building material of the \"magical persona\" precisely because of the sincerity with which she embraces them. This is an important point for in her book Carla is clearly showing (without necessarily nying to show) how such \"orthodox\" orientation should be respected and honored for what it is and the manner in which it serves her, independent of its persuasiveness as a belief-pattern with reference to the \"observer\". As long as there's a psychic and emotional connection, some innate harmony between the subject and this \"ideal of integration\", metaphysical wisdom suggests any tradition may be drawn on, any form of orthodoxy or heterodoxy may serve the operation of ordering and intensifying overall harmony of the personality, of drawing the \"granulated lines of intent\" into closer parallel or more cohesive unity of pattern. In the assumption of some reference furnishing the highest available model with which the subject yet has rapport, it becomes possible to draw upon a traditional reserve stably subtending the changeable \"subjective climate\" so as to possess a steady standard for assessing the values of love, service and wisdom minimally required fiom any Source by which the personality intends to be directed and further educated. Because of such practiced unity-of-intent, and the progressive demand made by this subtlest of the channelings to consolidate and extend the potency of intent into more comprehensive expressions of the whole being, Carla is uniquely enabled to state the actual terms of commitment necessary for the would-be-channeler. Here are no half-way measures, no glib \"how-to\" counsels. In fact Carla tellingly points up the deliberate lack of practical instruction in her handbook, flatly stating that some things, inclusive of plans for the atom bomb and practical instruction on how to channel, should by all means remain unpublished and out of reach of the general public! This uncompromising declaration accompanies her insistence that one should never practice channeling alone, and that one should always learn directly under an accomplished channeler preferably in a group context. Here then is the highest possible contrast to the long windy MacLaines of run-of-the-mill channelers glibly counseling indiscriminate surrender to any signal (with but a nebulous nod to some generic \"protection\" of the Divine Light), glad beyond deliriums of the ego's dearest dream to have gotten response from some bibulous spirit able to demonstrate its superior knowledge by tracking down one's larder of Scotch and so automatically warranting one's highest devotion! Here indeed is an antidote to the reckless outpourings of unaccomplished media-mavens popularizing something about which they know little to nothing (and creating in effect a spectacle parallel that of a mindless mob jumping the bandwagon bearing fame to whomever is sufficiently facile in selling the public on the benefits of owning one's private nuclear reactor). Carla always states the case in terms of what's really on the line. And she amongst them all should know; commensurate with the source's magnitude was the degree of difficulty and danger in channeling said source, and the whole Ra group bears the scars of that challenge. Since the quality of that Infomation was so much more valuable for understanding the real terms of existence (the requirements of being, and the stakes with which every soul is necessarily dealing whether alertly or not), there was a proportional energy of countervailing character the nature of which determined its interest should lie in blocking the flow of that information. It was in this way, and due to the uncommon intensity of the Source with which they were dealing, that the Ra channelers came most directly into contact and conflict with the Negative dimension of spiritual development (formulating"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the standard of its own integration in tern of personal power and other-domination so decisively far to the side of the demonic that it can only be in its \"best interests\" to keep the majority of seeking souls dwelling on a lower--and thus potentially exploitable-level, in the dark). This Negative factor, it must be understood, is always present in every form of channeling and hangs as well over most other things representing a bid for higher knowledge and development; this is what gives the continuous element of a hidden danger in the context of channeling, what makes the glib push toward the channeling bandwagon so fatuous and ill-informed. It's just that the presence of such Negativity is rarely so explicit, due to the relatively \"low level\" and indirect alignment with Spiritual Source-nature characterizing most extra-dimensional \"contacts\"--or to the deliberate masking of such presence by wiles of one type or another. But in the special instance of the Ra channeling all the cards are on the table. The higher-dimensional negative \"Orion\" entities make an overt bid to break the group, and even to carry Carla off in her \"soul\" state! It's out of this magnitude and intensity of experience that Carla qualifies for the wisdom which can state the \"channeling\" case in its most incisive expression, and in its real terms. Compared to Carla's observations on the subject, everything else (including the-& many ways excellent-Jane Roberts' philosophical ruminations) has to be considered secondary at best, and at worst detrimental. It's To Die For, Darlin' Just consider Carla's criterion for successfully \"challenging\" a spirit which has an- swered one's meditative invitation, and so has made a bid to \"borrow\" the vehicle of the channeler; she flatly states that in order for one's attuning prayers to possess the authority of coherence, consistency and conviction the channeler must first of all be very conscious of that for which he/she would die! This little stipulation, which she installs on the seeker's path at the very outset, draws the line in the real dimension of its terms. It should work immediately to split the wheat from the chaff' the dabbler from the aspirant; although in a real generosity of spirit she makes accommodation for the dilettante as well under protective proviso of the \"group only\" clause (so that, once the curiosity is satisfied at its own level the soul is fiee to turn toward fascinations of less moment without unseen adhesions of lopsided energy-fonns, or subtle refuse carrying over with quiet influence into other arenas). As Carla puts it, if you know what you'd die for you know what you'd live for; thus the subject of channeling is lifted immediately out of the category of \"play\", deprived of the glamor of existing-like a toy-for people's casual amusement, in the same way we attempt to take the sheen of glamor off a handgun so children won't mistake it for a thing of less consequence. This places the subject of channeling instantly and irrevocably in the field of mind/body development, spiritual transfigurement and all other challenges to whole-being magnification requiring a swift sobriety of intent, an uplifting of sights toward steadier consideration of the central terms of existence (terms cleaving gyroscopically to the persistent shadow-outline, the death penumbra). Her declaration indeed echoes a similar (authentic) injunction, that of the teacher \"Don Juan\" in Castaneda's saga: \"you must make death your advisor\". This \"rule\" seems to have provoked perplexity in certain of the readership of that saga; amazing it is, how this can be the case for so clear a mandate--unless at the point of such precise injunction we may detect the customary hesitation of the recreational seeker, the sudden reluctance to further \"comprehend\" anything turning thus Real (as opposed to merely glamorous, with nothing of consequence at stake) so that the common expression of the seeker at this point becomes a hunchbacked shrug of \"I don't quite"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV understand\" as the clear significance is forcibly pushed--like the presenting crown of a jack-in- the-box--below the threshold of \"conversational consciousness\", into the subconscious along with all other unwanted intimations of mortality thus fulfilling one of Freud's definitions of that deep zone as the refuse bin, the buried strata of mind's Medusa-locks unviewable for the horror it threatens to reveal. When it comes down to it, the criterion which Carla drops as a casual little minimum at the very outset immediately eliminates--in truth--the great majority of channelers or anyone who at any time would essay the art of channeling; we know perfectly well that the local \"channeler\" consulted on matters of love life, the market or the direction of our business investments isfirthest porn ever considering such criterion as the sine qua non of his own little business. And indeed just the opposite, for not is it only obvious he's ready to die for nothing; in fact he's turned to channeling in the first place for reasons far-too-similar to the class of concerns characterizing those who consult him. He's not interested at all in knowing what he might be willing to die for, since he's much too concerned with getting and granting advice on how to gather life, how to raise and worship his own pleasuredome, how to gain more and more and lose infinitely less. He's interested in his prolifera- tion, his potential magmfication to the degree of infinity--not his obvious cancellation in the face of infmity ; so our typical channeler, and those who may consult him, receive the type, quality, degree and value of information to which they aspire, from a \"source\" commensurate with the integrity and dedicated awareness of the request (i.e. the intent behind the request). To this measure we may acknowledge the clear cogency of Carla's concept that the art of channeling involves so high a degree of risk as to render it a subject for serious soul-development only; in substantiation of this viewpoint Carla gives us a definition of channeling which takes it out of its \"specialized\" slot, and seeks to install it as a central quality of our existence altogether. By defmition (she'd have us recognize), \"channeling\" is something which in its broadest sense we're always doing; a little reflection reveals we don't originate the pattern through which our most intimately \"personal\" thoughts discharge, we don't generate our own will-force so much as draw upon an already ordered process of volition to which we attach the value of personal identity etc. According to Carla, then, because we are by nature and not just by avocation \"channelers\" par excellence, channeling in its more narrow definition merely constitutes an extension, as it were, a natural amplification of our Faculty in such a way that as an initiatory process it serves indefinitely, comprising amongst all other esoteric arts a Way of choice describing a kind of unbroken linear \"ascent\". To the best of Carla's knowledge in tenns of a very real and therefore personally transfomtive practice, this exalts the subject of channeling as a valid philosophical proposition. Here however, is where initiated understanding rises to reply to the initiate's state, as finely exemplified at its own level by Carla herself. Return Of An English Channel (Or, Why The Droeshout Portrait Swims In The Seams Of Louvre) The idea that all process is \"channeling\", is a serviceable idea up to a point, allowing us to grasp our existence from a less personally-exclusive perspective; on the surface, the idea that we \"channel\" the states, patterns, forms and processes as which we give expression to our personalized \"I\" sense, is infectiously persuasive and furnishes a sort of picture whereby we may gain a fuller view on the whole business of individualized \"self'. Yet if we question this picture"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV philosophically, it begins to break up at a certain degree of persistent \"scnrtinizing\". When we ask who channels all this pattern and process, we suddenly wind up with a play of mirrors, a reflection verging on the unwanted displacement of an Infinite Regress. To say that \"we\" channel everything we do, are or know, necessarily confers an exempt status on the \"we\"; for if the \"seIfhood\" in relation to which all this channeling transpires is itselfchanneled, an immediate corridor of mirrors placing \"us\" at an infinite remove from ourselves is established. On the other hand, if the \"I\" of this sticky self-sense is constituted as the convergent reference-point or centralizing locus of all pattern and process, then it arises immediately and spontaneously as an endowment of the Whole, along with-and as the efficient coordinate Median of--everything else. It is no longer in the peculiar Moebius-knot of \"channeling\" itself. It is no longer an expression of identity at a chronic and unbridgeable remove from itself; it is by this understanding the irnmediate/expressive Identity of the Whole, functionally apprehended as a particular pattern of coordinate processes. It is a sure identity, without in any way being misconstrued as a self-creating identity (e-g. as the \"channeling\" thesis would indeed help us correct for, in the face of sundry reality-creation proclamations). Thus, as an immediately constituted locus of patterning coordinates, the sense of \"self\" is legitimately spontaneous and irreducible, exactly as it seems; and, if it isn't placed in the peculiarly self-contradictory position of having somehow to \"channel\" itself, neither does it retain the fantastical \"responsibility\" of creating or generating itself."},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV This then suddenly cuts \"channeling\" far back from its purported status as a universal function. We can no longer allow the defmition of channeling as a general category. The universe isn't basically \"channeling\". Since the locus of a sentient \"selfhood\" is everywhere the median tern and common denominator of all Process, we'must recognize that at every point the creative whole is constituting a coordinate reference. The \"self' of consciousness isn't a \"box\" in a graduated nest of boxes. There may be patterned \"nests\" of interacting, coordinate energy-systems; yet the interchange amongst all such systems comprises a mutual flux and reciprocally-modifying influence cross-indexing the \"I-sense\" as the very loms of the interactive flow-patterns. The \"I\" isn't a nestled \"concavity\" amidst such action through which everythmg passes, as through a stationary funnel. It is the convergent locus through which all coordinate processes engage their mutual interchange. It is such a locus by virtue of that process, not independent of it or as \"other than\" it. Being a centrist focus and self-reference it has no existence apart fiom the coordinate patterning as which it's cross-indexed. There is aprimary sense in which the \"I\" is related to its pattern; the I doesn't \"channel\" its pattern but rather, all interpenetration or reciprocal influence amidst nested energy-conduits that can be considered a kind of \"canalizing\" activity takes place as a constitutive process of the \"I\". Because the I is related in this primary way as the immediate and irreducible locus of the coordinate Mework through which it comes to expression, it can clearly distinguish the interpolation of another patterning locus in relation to which it (i.e. it as locus of a constituted whole) does function as channeling instrument. Thus primary processes may be configured as \"mutually canalizing\" activity, but the \"I\" isn't a channel construct, a \"pipe\" though which such activity flows. The I-pattern may only act secondarily as such a constituted \"pipe\" for the receipt of some influence or information fiom a whole-pattern locus mediating processes at a variant compositional angle from itself. At any given point the axes of polarized patterns may functionally flow around, through or between one another, so that one mework of reference may seem to be \"conducting\" the other. The impressions of such patterns may work on, through and in one another; the influence of one state of organization may certainly'serve to entrain another. Yet since all are equally constituted, at the \"juncture\" of infinity, as coordinate reference for a given framework of function, no self-system acts by infiite regress as a channel of itself. Our primary function is not that of channel. The I doesn't \"channel\" its cognitive patterns, its autonomic functions etc. Although such patterns and functions may interact as canalizing systems, conducting and transmitting in mutual interchange, the \"I\" is the common denominator of that entire process and not one stage of removal in it. Thus \"channeling\" is still a specialized sport. The phenomenon of \"channeling\" recedes to more localized expression. It becomes a function of special conditions not universal conditions. A Makeshift Stickshift For A Densitydrift Over The Dimensional Rift We may note for example the obvious fact that, despite Carla's assertion as to the universality of channeling, it has seldom taken the overt forn by which we identify it modernly. We can justifiably state that, despite scattered examples in our ancient (or scriptural) past of what"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV by interpretation may be termed \"channeling\", the actual phenomenon of channeling as recognized today is a recent development. This would tend to suggest that its specific and progressively-evident form as an \"otherworldly communication\" is a function of local conditions. It is in fact quite dependent on the particular configuration of energy-patterns comprising the passage of our \"globe\", the earth sphere, through a millennial process of transition. As earth inevitably bows to the imperatives of cosmic timing, its field rotates in modified relation to the multidimensional coordi- nates through which it's focused. This cosmic shift occurs with respect to the psychic \"net\" of energy-patterns modelling the particular phase-state of the collective, conscious planetary condition thus generating-& our case+ certain fiiction between the aggregate 3rd density \"mind-form\" as carried over into the oncoming context of a 4th density to which it's unsuited. Understood in this way, the phenomenon of channeling which erupts in very great contrast to ordinary cognitive processes at this particular cosmic juncture, may be identified as a specialized and even makesh$ extemporization fashioned pel1 me11 to help facilitate the transition, bridge the very rough gaps that split the earth-fabric as information lacunae--bewildering discrep- ancies between hazily-forming \"future\" models and familiar precedents with which they abruptly break. The grinding tension between the wheels of cosmic timing and the \"local\" resistance of a collective psychic atmosphere, between the requirements of the biosphere and its encoding \"noosphere\" produces cracks and fistulas, rents and leaks which take the form physically of a randomly \"liberated\" radiation (as the absorptive or enfolded/receptive sphere begins inexorably- if chaotically--to unfold and emit). As this disintegration-basically a breakdown between planes or encoded barriers of mutual screening--occurs, a randomized opportunity appears; and first of all, owing to chronically missed opportunities of understanding through indigenous cues and sources, it's determined such providential cracks and ambiguous splits between \"receding\" and \"oncoming\" realities of energy-influence should be taken advantage of, used by Sources superin- tending fiom higherlmore integral dimensions of the universal process. It's determined that strategic \"lines\" of communication between, amongst or through planes should be deliberately established as the old barriers dissolve, the long-serviceable grid of energy networks and psychic screens (traditionally sealing the focus of physical consciousness from undue influence) inexorably erodes from persistent pressure to transcend such cramped enclosureyressure taking the form of yearnings and therefore psychic requests for a higher knowledge, an enlarged framework of operations in both the positive and negative sense. So first of all there's established a tremulous delicate line, a fiber-thin channel of specific linkage establishing conditions of a special configuration between the systems of embodied consciousness, and the patterns of energy-intelligence comprising foci of intent beyond the deb- iting fiamework of physical expression. The initial linkages or \"cable wirings\" that become established through such opportunistic break in the barriers manifest as those of a basically positive nature, owing to the subtlety of operations required to organize key values of participating light-units in such a way as to produce a reasonably symbiotic condition and not+t least immediately+ state of crushing pressure to the \"receiving\" polarity, the physically-focused channeler. Thus positive forces necessarily forge the way--and this is why, by-and-large, we are at first recipient of quite positive knowledge and at least reasonably helpful philosophy encouraging us to adopt its recommended changes in deference to the claim of Superior Viewpoint. Part of such knowledge, indeed, is necessarily identifiable as the effort to educate as to the very existence of such a viewpoint"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Since however the initial planetary \"call\" for such knowledge isn't unambiguous (and indeed arises in some substantial measure hm a bias towardpower implanted or inflated by parallel off-zone activities of a more materially-oriented character, in keeping with the respective angle of approach) there follows in response to the Heilirig frequencies a corresponding effort from extra-dimensional denizens seeking to wire the psychic atmosphere with negative propaganda. In keeping with the pseudo-creative or mimicking mode of the Negative constitution, the activity of this second-wave of specialized \"help7' fiom the Other Side doesn't proceed so much by looping its own channels or pioneering its own networks as by appropriating the lines and transdimensional wires already linked by initial effort of the positive. The specially consrructed (note: specially constructed) inner vehicles for bridging, coupling and variably-locking the channel modules or respective units participating in the phenomenon are precipitously commandeered, appropriated during \"lulls\" of active use or simply seduced over to Negative-employment with scarcely a sign to signal the transition (wherever the physically-focused channeler slides off the slim mark, imperceptibly shifts in psychic orientation as a function of the low-level unsure waffling that characterizes the-basically uncodtted4ll-ambivalent ego consciousness of the physical sphere). Due to the intrinsically coarser character of the negative communication (seeing that it's constitutionally polarized toward luteinizing of the lower centers and corporeal systems in themselves) the progressive \"use\" of borrowed lines and transdimensional avenues initially fashioned by Positive intent inevitably corrodes the delicate balances of the general Construct; far from honoring the ~ymbiotic character of the channel-networks initially arranged through coopera- tion of Positive sources and benignly-moved foci of the physical plane, the Negative \"CNSader~~~ act in parasitic fashion, taking up habitation at the expense of the host. Indeed the channeling process itself, being an opportunistic makeshifi in lieu of more organiclnahtral ways of bridging the earth-sphere transition, is under the best of circumstances faulty; under the most positive of influences it spots an inbuilt limit to which it can be of benefit to the spiritual growth and rnindhdy development of the channeler. At its best it wasn't designed by an Ideal providence to function as indefinitely-reliable mode or staunch means for the channeler to grow and expand, along lines of communication actually assembled fiom needs of the moment. Indeed at its most unambiguously positive (where the Source is motivated in Positive Purity of the higher planes and the channeler is devoted, cautious, attentive and a sedulous ego-guardian) the art of channeling operates as a kind of expedient pact. It really proceeds as an \"inner\", prearranged agreement between the higher-dimensional Sources desiring to Channel, and the deeper-less consciously-accessible-Soul-requirements of the channeler (the \"consent\" of the latter emanating from psychic zones correspondiig to the \"dream-mind\", practically out of reach or recall of the ordinary focus of consciousness which acts in \"shock\" when results of the silent spiritual agreement erupt into daylight apprehension). The channel-occasion is then an inner agreement of \"symbiotic\" relationship in which it's known \"beforehand7' to the deep-psyche that such relationship is, to a degree, a sacrifice on the part of the channeler owing to the limits of the mode. Since even the mostpositive of Sources must use the channeler as a specially-adapted and retuned instrument to perform functions for which it wan 't specifically designed, there's implicit recognition at the Soul-level that the channeler must suffer net loss in the long run, must indeed run down over the curve of the process for at its best, the makeshift channeling system is highly entropic."},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Thus the channeler may benefit (e.g. progress, mentally and spiritually, in terms of soul development) from the overail incarnative experience of the channeling pact; but at the deep Soul level there's always implicit recognition and \"contractual\" acknowledgment that the channeler is necessarily trading, giving away the ultimate health and/or longevity of the vital system as long as the activity persists-for there's unrecoverable energy-loss in the transaction even at its most economic, its most scrupulously parsimonious. This inbuilt limitation re the mind-body growth (in persisting, incarnative development) of the Channeler, is fiuther aggravated by the inevitable deterioration of the overall channeling avenues, the aggregate inter-dimensional lines, fiom their ideal of efficiency by the predictable follow-up habitation of Negative squatters infesting the available \"lanes\" as much as possible and wearing them to progressive coarseness, broadening and battering their originally-refined materials. Thus over time the channeling lanes themselves, irrespective of their specific use in any given case by \"positive\" or \"negative\" entities, become infected; on the whole their constitution succumbs to contagion, and becomes progressively dangerous to the health andlor well-being of the channeler's continued use. In such a circumstance, all the \"challenging\" and \"rites of protection\" are not enough; the wholefield is infected, and the positive cannot comprise (under such conditions of overall negative decay of the biosphere) an adequately purifling monitor to sustain the \"safety net\", so to speak, of the channeler's high-wire act. The Gresham's Law of economics, whereby \"bad\" money inevitably chases \"good\" money out of circulation, holds true in transference to the spiritual sphere, at least under conditions of this most difficult of earth-transitions. Thus channeling cannot be considered a natural phenomenon and a part of our \"perma- nent\", ongoing condition as incarnate beings. In fact, it erupts as a very specialized contemporary phenomenon of quite transient lifespan, and we alree behold it in its decaying stages. It comprises indeed a transitory co~~ll~lunication,. one which has already seen its best days. Several channel sources themselves (i.e. Starseed Transmission, Agartha) have noted that by 1989 the better part of the important and required channeling would be accomplished. We can infer the cataract of \"stufl\" that inevitably continues to pour is slush and afterbirth-refuse, leftover junk lending itself admirably to the progressively negative cast. Indeed the \"greatest channeler of all time\", Carla R herself, has lost contact irreparably with her greatest contact, the 6th density Ra social/memory/com- plex. Because of the specialized and largely makeshzp or ad hoc character of the \"channeling\" phenomenon, then, and because it tends under such extemporaneous circumstances to succumb to the spiritualized Gresham's Law, we cannot concur with Carla's ultimate conclusion that spiritual growth and development may proceed in smooth linear continuity with the channeling \"beam\", once connection with that beam is established. No, that beam has its definite limitations, and the channeler's development under its light is provisional to the extent that it necessarily conforms to, and sacrifices on behalf of, the spiritual Intent of the higher source. As Carla rightly points up, such \"sacrifice\" on the part of the channeler is a loving service which places the personality in good stead with hidher own souldevelopment. But the character of channeling itself, (i.e. that it's a communication of knowledge fiom a developed Source independent of one's own still-partially-closed centers or bio-psychic systems of personal knowl- edge) ought to tip us off on the type of inbuilt limit to which the channeler, as channeler, is subject. For the kind of progressed, mindlbody integral development and higherdimensional organization of centers and systems that would assure continued incarnative development (important in terms"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of spiritual economy since the earth-sphere with its coefficient-of-resistance maximally speeds development, of all the planes and spheres) is precisely what's short-circuited by the necessary entropy of the channeling phenomenon! The channeler is always, in a sense, used by the channeling Source no matter how positive in Itself, so that by the end of an extendedly-dedicated channeling career the \"vehicle\" of the channeler, hisher mind-body circuitry, is critically drained, depleted of the necessary reserves of bio-psychic capital needed for any further integration and Whole-being Awakening through the completion-polarity of the physical dimension itself. It must here be noted that the \"first\" and most well-known of the modem channelers, Jane Roberts, died eventually of a failed thyroid--the thyroid of course is the \"gland\" corresponding to the subtle plexus (vissudha-chakra) which is modified and strategically adapted to channeling purposes through its shadow-ingress at the back of the head, where the personality is to be used as a vocal \"instnunent\". Such death represented the symbolic limit of her sacrificial \"pact\" with higher-dimensional intelligence (this is not in itself something ''negativeW--only those who view death as in itself \"negative\", could view this fact as the conclusive case for the \"demonism\" of the whole channeling process). In a sense, because her spiritual development had been wholly \"de- voured\" and was totally \"accounted for\" by channeling, Roberts had \"nowhere to go\". Her death under those circumstances was ineluctable. From that initial \"standing ground\", there is nothing le_F after the Influence has been spent on the Intent of its object; there is no continuity and unbroken spiritual progression possible as a simple extension of channeling, onward and upward as a perpetual information-conduit into the light. There is instead a sudden interruption, an abrupt break. The quick fissure for which channeling originally presented itself as a stopgap measure reappears in completelypersonal terms, standing as a sudden Abyss before the channeler. And, from the conventional staging-ground that the channeler has assumed, it's an unbridgeable Chasm. Carla herself reports continuously a progressive ill health. Her Ra contact (for which she certainly receives the award as \"greatest all-time channeler\") was broken some years ago, and though she continues to channel \"4th and 5th density\" entities she has been, unbeknownst to her but for all practical purposes, abandoned thereby. Her self-admission that the Ra entities were her personal favorite gives clear indication she realizes it's all \"downhill\" from here, and that inferentially the material she channels now is repetitious, almost prerecorded, a monotonous anti-climactic extension of an endeavor past its prime as far as the greatness of the \"Ra\" material is concerned. Why then isn't she told this by the channeling Entities themselves? For the simple reason that they aren't her spiritual keepers. They have specific \"spiritual functions\" and \"duties\" of communication to perform, and as long as a particular channeler offers himlherself to that service just so long will they avail themselves of the instrument! They do not comprise the Absolute Balance of her own spiritual center; no higher-dimensional entity, no matter how \"complete\" in itself, can function as such (for then it would be substituting Itself for one's own ultimate spiritual realization); any such Entity no matter how \"complete\" in itself and no matter how balanced the content of its instruction, can only comprise a deflective influence oflcenter as far as the continued implementa- tion of its function with respect to the channeler is concerned. There is then no sublime continuity of progressive spiritual unfolding through inner connective shaft of the \"channeling\" beam; there is at best only abandonment. And indeed ifsuch blunt abandonment does take place, it is that taking-leave itself which comprises the ultimate"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV purposeful contribution of the Channeled Entity to the further spiritual progress of the channeler. At the optimum of Divine Grace the channeler is left, abandoned and alone, in the dark, at the brink of an Abyss. However, it is exactly that chronic pactice of cocoon-like enwrapping and \"cozy\" Cancerian protection in the Light, which had distinguished the career of the channeler up to this point. The dark is utterly unfamiliar to the channeler, indeed helshe is not likely even to recognize its imminent presence but rather, in reaction to any such intimation, would cling to the envelope of that habituated light all the more insistently. Indeed, not recognizing helshe was standing at that very, abrupt brink of the discontinuous Transition required for mergence into the Form of a direct Higher-knowing (and emergence out of the cocoon of channeled Light), the tendency of the channeler without adjustive benefit of higherlinitiated Perspective would be to assume Closure of spiritual development for the lifetime! The tendency would be to assume the work had already been done, everything that was or could be accomplished had been accomplished. The tendency would be to begin speaking of hidherself in the past tense, as if quietly closing the books, termination of the Key Channeling being taken as one-to-one equivalent for termination of any further development. Just when the most critical Moment of spiritual development in all the lifetimes is called for, the channeler is most likely to convince hiherself that no further transformation is required but that everything may proceed in natural, unbroken linear continuity \"upward\". Since in fact any \"linear\" advance or unfolding in sacrificial submission to a \"higher Intent\" is cut 08 critically terminated, the channeler will at this point tend to mistake an intuming upon the ego-self in progressively exclusive attachment to a personal insularity in \"the light\" for forward progress; there will be the tendency to exactly mistake retrogression for Advance. But MT is not Carla Rueckert7s biographer. He does not feel that \"greatest all-time channeler\" is sufficient for her epitaph, engraved in premature stone. That is exactly why MT is considered such an incorrigible Troublemaker. That is exactly why he never takes No for an answer, even in one's sweetest sleep and dearest dreams of Light. Blessings to you, Carla darlin'; don't let the Blue Moon of Kentucky keep you long. Carla's Channeling Handbook gets the big 5 stars because it is a model of the genre; it jkIflls our requirement of a work having \"gongjk \" (i.e. it \"catches fire \"-in Carla 's case, it comes to a slow conrroIIed boil); and at the same time the intelligence, skill and thoroughness with which it is conceived and done jkIfIIs the second indispensable requirement for the conferral of 4%-5 stars: the book's overall qualify 19s it out of exclusive significance for the given \"genre \"only, and places it on a level of more universal consideration.

This his loving soul-counsel that has been paid for in the only negotiable currency honored at that level: soul trial, travail and experience.

'891 FEATURING: WHY YOU DON7 \"CREATE YOUR OWN REALIN\" by Morris Tarantella Jeers The \"Two-To-One Lazaris Is Pete Rose's Business Consultant\" award. To the innumer- able \"me too\" channel sources and their accommodating mounts, who've been espousing and promoting the bumptious New Age dogma \"you create your own reality\". Let's get this straight. Extra-mundane source or no extra-mundane source, the sensibilities of all the rest of mankind aren't deceiving them: you do not \"create your own reality\". \"Oh, what a spoilsport!\" we can just hear the chorus. Why not let those who want to, abide peacefully in the solipsism of their spook-sanctioned presumption thatdespite the alleged interconnectedness of everythi~g-the common ego-communique of personal hexmetic insularity is valid after all, and \"I\" can indeed conjure a positive-think Paradise to \"preserve me eternal\" in the midst of everyone else's self-created, hallucinatory world-disaster. Pure compassion compels this contraindication, explained from the Initiated point of view; for the ultimate result of experiencing the philosophical shortcomings of such a proclamation, is to leave no room for the subject other than to suppose some personal deficiency, an inadequate grasp of the principle or incomplete commitment of belief. When special consensus has it you can make your trailer-truck fly through the private force of will, you can only come down hard on yourself when it inevitably fails to do so. This is hardly preferable to the \"personal sense of helplessness\" such a precept of wishful thinking was supposed to compensate. One would think a person might actually be grateful, should someone come along and simply point out to him it isn't his fault, that the \"special consensus\" is wrong. But what about all the evidence to the effect our circumstances do indeed tend to correspond to, and often even print out in an uncannily mirroring way, the strongest profile of our personal wants, aims, wishes, desires, hopes, fears and traits? Often things \"come to us\", situations or opportunities materialize as if by magic in answer to some personal formulation of wish or will, that nonetheless quite clearly couldn't have been induced to \"slide into place\" by strictly personal effort, by hard physical work or ordinary exertion in the spacetime field. It's quite true that often things, people and events seem drawn into our sphere by a coordination of factors manifestly beyond our personal grasp, but answering eerily to the character of our personal being as if genii had conjured them. This widely-held observation isn't incorrect. It is the part of reality that makes of the New Age dogma a half-huth. It reflects a real, functional principle in the esoteric description of the mind-body whole; but it does not thereby authorize the fatuous \"you create your own reality\" as a full-blown truth in its own right."},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Why You Don't \"Create Your Own Reality\" Just sit there for a minute. Attune to a mere soupqon of self-reflective consciousness and you can't help but notice you're hardly self-generated; there isn't one thing about yourself, including the environment you perceive or your \"personal\" will, that issues fiom any sense of a self-creating \"you\". Indeed, \"you\" are spontaneously endowed, before the self-reflective fact, as the coordinate presence of a total and given pattern of Bemg. It is all immediately established, without personal intercession on your part. The patterns through which you perceive, the modes by which you move and cognize take up yow being without a whimper of protesf a hint of objection or even notice. This vastly creative process by which you spontaneously come to yourself, on its terms, is so suavely accepted as inherent expression of your being that you claim it as yourserfwithout even observing you do so (i.e., these are \"my\" thoughts, \"my\" words, \"my\" perceptions, \"my\" ideas, \"my\" movements). Wait, we hear the protests, perhaps I don't actually create the basic pattern of Being or the functions of existence, but I do seem to individualize them. I make them my own. I synthesize all these \"given\" features as personal contents fiom my unique angle, so that \"my\" expression of the common pattern is distinguishable from yours and so very intimately identifiable as me. In that sense I create my own reality out of the given materials, which really aren't anything in particular until I endow them with the unique expressive life that is \"me\". This ordinary qualification is acceptable, as long as we notice that the vaunted \"person- alization\" or \"individualizing\" of the general creative endowment of Being is also afimction of that endowment, not something privately assumed. The creative pattern of Being, of which we are expression, individualizes. That is its attribute, not ours. It can only be considered innately \"mine\" insofar as \"I\" come after the fact, along with the perspectival endowment of individualization. In that sense I am the process of individualization; but I don't create it. The Cloud Of One-Knowing \"I\" exist in reflective and receptive relation to that process which takes its point of departure fiom the total, given Pattern of Being. My \"knowing\" comes structured. It is a function of consciousness, or whole-awareness (i.e. conscious self-awareness); but it furnishes an interpretive syntax of cognition to that consciousness. It possesses an inbuilt grammar of structured variables. All my instmental processes, modes of action and so forth are patterned terms of this \"knowing\". The overall function of my being with its sensory and motor, autonomic and conscious systems is that of knowing. In reality there aren't a lot of different \"systems\", diverse organs and instrumental complexes, some for physiological processing and life-sustenance, some for acting and responding, some for perceiving and some for knowledge. There is only an overall system or multi-dimensional Pattern of differentiated currents, properties and phases serving the single common function of Knowing; for the whole pattern is an expression of consciousness."},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Thinking With The Whole Being Therefore the thinking, conceptualizing, interpreting, ideating and identifying ordinarily assumed to belong to specialized mind-brain processes, isn't a local operation of cerebral tissue and cortical neurochemistry at all. Thinking, cognizing and even perception itself are functions of the total, multidimensional mind-body system. You do not just think with lobes of the mind-brain or its interacting hemispheres; you think with the whole of your being. A thought is as much an expression and patterned representation of the processes of your heart and vital centers, your lungs and kidneys as it is a manifestation of your cortex and limbic structures. Nor do your various, interacting systems just exist on one level (as the composite function of their stylized perceptual processing reductively outpictures). All forces and fields that integrate the resultant \"monoplane\" image or reductive composite we perceive as the physical body, actually organize the systems of mind-body circuitry through a complex multi-dimensional har- monics. It's through this harmonic pattern that the material, \"molecular\" field is fdtered. The range of energies for the complex circuit includes negatively entropic (organizational) properties, every bit as much as certain screened or filtered phases may exhibit locally entropic characteristics. Thought, perception, cognition and idea in their normal occurrence are simply unre- marked testament to the fact that the multidimensional field of the mind-body axis organizes a fluctuating psychic signature; it is the changing configuration of an overall identity-pattern having vital, emotional, linguistic and abstract-cognitive components correlated with specific harmonics of its focal centers and currents. Locking The Mind-Body Tumblers Into The \"World We Know\" The thinking patterns and cognitive processes associated with the physical cortex, represent the conscious axis and its voluntary systems as a whole; they correspond by resonant harmonics to the subtle center associated with the pineal gland, and current-fields aligned with the fiontal plexus. The mid-brain and limbic systems with their specific, affective patterns focus in the subtle plexus and energy-fields associated with regulatory agencies of pituitary and hypothalamus; they correlate by resonant harmonics with the respiratory system and thyroid, the heart and its subtle centers physically represented through thymus gland and cardiac plexus. The medullary centers and basal brain-lobes associated with the R-complex correspond to the abdominal and reproductive centers as well as subtle systems patterning the physical loci of sacral plexus and gonads, the gastric nerves and cells of Leydig. The interaction of these systems as agents of the cognitive process serving to pattern and regulate the overall, mind-body field through which thinking and perception takes place, is practically adjusted and locked into a chronic circuit of allowable ''terms\" according to standards of enculturation, i.e. the way in which attention and the sensory-motor faculties are trained to focus and respond through specific cues as well as collective psychic atmospheres of family and general social order. \"My\" reflective and receptive relation to the total, multi-dimensional pattern (concen- trated as a sliding scale of operative alignments through the Conscious axis-of-Being) composes the \"individualization\" process as a questing interpretation of what that Being is. I don't create the"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV tenns of that Being ex nihilo; but I spontaneously appropriate the general pattern of its collective recognition. Psychic Circulations In The Auric Field In this way there's generated a multidimensional sphere of magnetic values comprising an auricjield, the atmosphere of lights and subtle currents carrying the coded energy-signatures of thought, emotion and identity. \"My\" thinking and cognizing is an expression of that total field; the general coherence and characteristic intensity of the thinking (correlated with overall ego-integra- tion and alignment) determines the average strength, power and influence of the resultant electro- magnetic network of the auric field. There's a constant, atmospheric circulation of changeable thought-patterns through that field building and breaking, gathering and dissipating; such psychic energy-forms flux through the various centers or subtle \"chakras\" to which they correspond by type and tonality. According to their value and charge they may attract corresponding charges and psychic energies fiom the adjacent atmospheres of peoples and places; or they may be attracted to them. The relative ephemerality of these forms as they surge, pulse and change like winking firefly-lights in the auric field, has to do with the fact that a large part of thinking is passive and perfimctory. Though thoughts and their characteristic pattems circulate around the more durable identity-values or central idea complexes of the personality and therefore inevitably bear the ego's signature, little specific attention is invested in them during the casual process of their formulation; thus they come and go, breathe in and out through \"portals\" of the psychic centers and their corresponding systems like transient caricatures roughly sketched from material of the energy-media to which they most immediately answer. Random thoughts of sexuality, flickers of envy, fear or fanciful hope continuously energize related lobes and psychic centers of the conscious complex in the germination of fragmentary patterns, loose correlations of formative fields and typal structures that stream in webs of astral matter coupling and severing, repelling and attracting the atmospheres of people, places and events as a turbulence of incessant interchange. The random surge of such broken thought-en- tities and emotional swirls in and through the auric field of the personality exerts a constant (if shifting and ephemeral) influence on behavior patterns, usually on the instinctual or reflex-vital processes associated with the abdominal centers and corresponding basal brain lobes; for the fountainous discharge of the major part of thinking through the interior monologue scarcely reaches on an average any higher than the passively meditated middlings of the subliminal psyche, the vital-instinctual structures and their correlated thought-fonns compulsively taking up the slack in the extended gaps and dead pauses between active, volitional thinking. In this way the overall, electrical field-pattern of the personality sublimidly enforces the general psychic code through which cognitive and perceptual processes polarize the \"filtrate grid network\" that ultimately aligns an apprehensible World from the encircling energy-atmosphere. That energy-atmosphere is itself the extended field of the multidimensional being, carrying all the patterning potential eflectively organized through the Conscious Axis; it is full of life, bristling with subconscious and quasi-conscious \"points\" through which the coordinates of form are plastically polarized according to the configurations of type aligned out of the collective, psychic pattern of the auric fields."},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Drawing Physical Perception Through The Energy-Atmosphere Here then is how the ultimate, taken-for-granted impression of \"the world\" is formed: out of a cosmic potential of focal patterns featuring variable ratios-of-alignment in the processing interaction ofmultidimensional psychic systems, the collective requirement of self-conscious beings finds affinity with a particular consensual order and enforces the typology of that order through the mutual support of \"telling its story\", i-e. the incessant reciting of its cognitive description through devices of enculturation and learnjug, introjected as the stream of the \"interior monologue\". Through the auric field, the multidimensional Axis is polarized as a filtrate grid-network generating a characteristic psychic pattern; that pattern interacts with and reinforces the fieldconfiguration of all other, \"auric foci\" or personalitycomplexes, augmenting and emphasizing the most broadly- shared features. The collective field-configuration links up with and magnetically aligns the atmospheric potential of the World-pattern, filtering its coordinates into conformance with neces- smy symbolic consistencies of the general, consensual typology. At this stage of conscious development the characteristic polarization-alignment of coaxial energy fields emphasizes the material (or \"anisometric\") values of the overall, psychic pattem; owing to that fact we tend to perceive a world in which rhinoceroses and elm trees, mosquitoes and taxicabs are \"real\"; and we therefore tend at the same time to screen out and so recess into the psychic comer of indirect influence, the equally viable Worlds in which sprites and unicorns, undines and astral windchimes are real. We tend to lock in the mechanical instrumentalities of spacetime, the muscle, bone, sinew and synapse which accomplishes causative \"effect\" by the \"sweat of one's brow\"; and we tend to lock out the psionic agencies, the faculties of clairvoyance and clairsentience which nonetheless persist as potentials of the total pattem indirectly, diffused at the peripheries of standard focal emphasis. The Star-Seed Of The Active ''I\" Thought In addition to the fact that the average of our \"passive\" monologous thinking (emanated, in fluctuating bursts, fiom the general \"fixed\" ratio of patterning processes characterizing interac-"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV tion of the psychic centers) continues to align the responsive correlations of a \"familiar\" world-or- der, there is the important fact that all such random circulation of thought pivots around the more persistent and coherent complex of the ego-identity with its constellation of \"nuclear\" ideas. The more integral and stable system of impressions belonging to the essential ego-identity, acts as monitor of innate \"interest\"; in the circulation of miscellaneous, monologous thoughts and perceptual impressions there is intermittently struck a chord resonating to the value of that very \"interest\". The processes of passive thinking are quickened, the intensity of psychic and emotional investment picked up to the degree of generating \"concerned\" or active thought. This thought doesn't mviftly dissipate through one or more of the discrete \"centers\" or chakras, discharging as a simple expression of the immediate energy fields correlated with its vital value. Active thought, belonging to a more coherendintegral order of processing (in association with the relative integration and coherence of the central ego-identity) becomes progressively organized through a coaxial patterning of the centers and their respective energy-fields; where the thrust of active thought is dciently prolonged or repeated, concentrated and intense, it becomes distilled as a highly charged muItidimensionaI seed encoding the potential patterns of the fields and planes through which it was psychically elaborated. It incorporates values of the vital being and the psychic-emotional being; it has abstract ideative properties and has been processed through subtle psychic chambers of the heart and mind-brain, having occupied all the portals and compartments where it might be tailored with suitable appointments of the overall ego-organization. Most importantly, it becomes multidimensionally \"cohesive\" by virtue of its infusion by the Conscious Light of Identity. Reaping What Is Sewn Invested with the self-luminous signature of identity (adapted to the personal identity of the ego-pattern) the active thought becomes a courier of Volition, the will of the conscious axis--at this level, egoically expressed. In its gathered, intensified and distilled seed fonn, it passes as a \"mature\" thought of ego-identity through the locus of the Third Eye; in this way the relatively coherent idea which it encapsulates, \"appears\" in the creative light of Mind in accompaniment of significant electrochemical changes in the mind-brain pattern. This is a process that goes on all the time, about which people at the present level of perception are simply unaware though they're continuously engaged by it. The burgeoning potential lines and dimensional geometries \"ipscribed\" in the patterns of the seed-thought (i.e. abstracthoetic, psychiclastral, viWphysical) break out irrepressibly under incubating heat of the Mental Light in which they abide. They're nurtured, energized, cultivated and \"trained\" into conformal alignment with other, impressioned coordinates coded into thought seeds of the Light realm. Levels of organization in the creative Intelligence of that Light (corre- sponding to degrees of \"oversoul\" consciousness) attend the generation of those seeds magically ripened as values of ego-identity in the Light. This process of interweaving the patterns of mature thought-seeds, is a much more purposive activity than the flux of psychic energy-forms conditioning momentary behavioral interactions according to the aggregate of memory-impressions inscribed in the soul record, and imprinted in the etheric energy-systems governing subconscious metabolism. The guided direction of the tremendous, \"hydroelectric\" pressure contained in those basic seeds of identity, organizes the patterns not only of personal but collective experience; it integrates and makes of \"one piece\""},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the personal and collective levels. The experience of nations, societies, cultures and institutions is thus understood as a resultant of the sum tendencies of every \"personal\" constituent. In this way the subject does indeed receive, mirrored back from the apparently external environment, a faithful reflection of the qualities and implications contained in the \"personally\" formed and inwardly nurtured thought-seed corresponding to some central feature of the identity. This is hardly the equivalent, however, of the private deism expressed in the New Age doctrine \"you create your own reality\". The mighty creative magnitude through which abstract potential of the coded thought pattern becomes realized in energy networks, organized in working lines-of-force subject to percepturn-filtration of mind/body alignments, is hardly expressive of personal fiat. What I Think, And What I AM The very fact that the generality of thinking at this level of conscious development is embedded in \"anisometric\" pattern of relative material density, necessarily makes all such thoughts \"opaque\", one-sided, solicitous of the force of identity through imbalance and aggravated dichot- omy. For this reason, the particular cherished \"self '-thought is not the whole thought. The available ego-system of this present, imbalanced level of development can only be aware of a surface facet of the entire \"thought-entity\" which it entertains. The whole thought, of which the ego-identity perceives a preferred portion, possesses a global character as expression of the extended, multidi- mensional axis of Being. Remember, you think with the whole being. The thought (encoding the centrally-held precepts of ego-identity) contains much more information than the precious \"cross-section\" it models under the narrow beam of conscious focus. It possesses a round plenum of aspects involving all the implications of its highlighted features. It embodies not only the tangent considerations and forms of consequence that blur over the borders of clearest focus; it exhibits a veritable iceberg of submerged strata in which integrals of gradation, as well as the shadow-obverse of all overt values, are to be found inposse like coiled springs carrying the enfolded patterns and codessf-force of the dimensions. Ego Of Self-creation: The Sorcerer's Apprentice The \"angular obliquity\" at which such hidden wholeness is received (at the present focal level and in the framework of collective, conscious development) means that only a portion of the full implication of a given thought will usually come to expression as an experienced life-pattern at any given time. It's for this reason that, on a local scale, we may often presume we \"see\" our personal thinking accurately reflected back to us in the features of our experience, faithfuily rendered on a one-to-one basis in such a way as to warm the cockles of any good solipsist's heart. What we may be much more reluctant to recognize, or \"can't\" seem to recognize because it constitutes the underside of our \"self' that we interpret theoretically as \"other\", is the way in which the faithful thought like a slavish retrieving-Spaniel relentlessly returns in the context of our experience, only bringing progressively less-identifiable phases of our \"mental command\" for consideration and inspection. Where at first it dutifully fetched the morning paper as per \"instruction\", it now seems to rummage after dirty boots, dead birds and neighbors' garbage. This is why, despite wishful thinking and the encomiums of otherworldly communiques, our experience in fact is always a mixture in the materialization of our most positive expectations"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV and worst fears, often seeming to come wnfoundingly in tandem. At the present level of conscious development, our \"godlike\" decrees through thinking and desiring have much more the character of the nescient conjurations of the sorcerer 's apprentice. Our thought provokes a flood of successive experiences we can't seem to stop. The Whole Light Of Identity, The Half-Light Of Identification The real source of this manifold magnification of our thinking in terms of life-experience, comes fiom the practical investment of the Whole-value of Identity (equal on an absolute basis to Consciousness) in delimited patterns of identification equal only to the proportions of ego. The unqualified scope belonging to the real Light of Identity, provisionally invested in its qualifying term of identification, bridles within the restricting thought-seed like the dawn-horse of heaven champing at the bit. The limitless power of that Light is the efficient force which pushes, aided by its companion powers of Intelligence already awake in that Light at higher levels and superintending the birth-throes of the thought-seed; It pushes fiom \"within\" the abstract strictures of the thought- seed, as it were, like a Gargantua impossibly compressed within a tiny house that can't contain Its transcendental dimensions. And in pushing, It hrst of all forces the thought-seed to surpass its confinement to the \"nonmanifest\", the emptiness of abstract potential; for Reality in its fullness can't be limited to the undifferentiated-abstract of creative potential (as certain schools of \"spiritual realization\" would have it), seeing that the prolific fields of manifestation indwell the Real just as well. The tremendous energy of that Light imbuing the thought-seed in uneasy alliance, pours through the enfolded lines in the pattern of the seed and pushes them out, everts and ejects them as it moves most fluidly through the conduits of the prefigured \"paths\"; the thought-seed begins to sprout globally in crystalline filaments like a branching quartz, the Light of Identity coherently beaming in geometric spires and, in so doing, assuming the \"shape\" of the inspiriting idea through the dimensions. The rich global Symmetry in the extension of its phases becomes \"split\" into successive keworks in terms of the progressively broken symmetries of the spacetime densities, organized according to the potential of polarized \"masking\" belonging to the focal grid-networks of physical perspective. In this way the full deck of our experience which we have \"designed\" by our charac- teristic thinking is shuffled and dealt out piecemeal. Some of its \"hands\" we recognize as the combinations we coveted and prayed for, some seem dealt fiom underneath by the Adversary Himself; but all such hands are meant to cumulatively \"fill out\" the deficient understanding of the ego, so that-whether consciously or just below the threshold of conscious recognition--the ego comes ultimately to learn more about the implications of its \"world-view\", its chronic way of thinking, than could be gathered fiom the strictly one-to-one input of its personal, surface consid- erations. Change Of Thought (Got To Admit It's Getting Better) It may be seen by this that an \"enlightened\" view involves more, then, than just a shift from conventionally \"negative\", self-defeating styles of thought to more positive and self-aErming styles of thought; for, whereas such a shift if really taken to heart might eventually improve one's"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV attitude and capacity to receive experience of various descriptions, it cannot live up to any expectation of permanently establishing a purely \"positive\" and personally desirable flood of experience. For such a shift would merely be like walking fiom one comer of the same room, to the other. You may wind up standing near a sunnier side of the house, but you're still confined to the same limited structure. You're still standing on the same \"plane\". Analogously, you remain focused and effectually locked in to your limited patterns of identity so long as you remain identified with the ordinary level altogether, where perception of the Whole is functionally masked, and the incalculable Divine pattern of Being is chronically dimin- ished to the scarcely-noticed stature of the \"handmaiden of compulsive self-reference\"+ self-ref- erence that can only continue topine away for a reality which is infinitely consistent with its wishes and desires, and which therefore could be characterized as perfectly self-created. Or Change Of Heart (All You Need Is Love) There is only one \"out\" to the otherwise irresolvable dilemma of moving fiom one comer of the same, single-level house to the other, fiom negative to positive position and back again in the confines of the same dismal room. When identity, despairing of its identification with the purely personal wants and demands of unrequited ego-existence, turns its tentative face in alignment with the incommensurable magnitude of global Being, the individuated focus apprehended as \"me\" becomes wholly reoriented to the value of life. \"I\" become a perfectly receptive configuration with respect to the Intelligence of the Whole. From that point forward, \"I\" become an expression of the Whole, directly and accurately reflecting Its greatest good, not \"mine\". Nor does this mean, by virtue of harmonious attunement with Spiritual Being, \"I\" am vouchsafed the comfort and personal harmony of experience that previously eluded me; on the contrary, in submission as a receptively-oriented focus for the expression of Divine Desideration, the quality of \"personal\" experience may be by turns placid or disturbed, there is never any telling--only its unpredictability is certain. What is established, however, is that the active agent of change-in-the-world is no longer the oblique, partial perspective of ego-identification but the direct supervision of Divine Mind working events and circumstances into a far more coherent, stable, fertile and potentiating ground for the realization of Conscious Presence. You Forgot To Ask \"Who Goes There?\" Finally, one may well ask \"just what is the basis of these various extradimensional sources that seem to encourage belief in the proposition 'you create your own reality'? Aren't sources that emanate from beyond bodily confines of the physical sphere somehow more innately aware of the underlying principles of existence? Shouldn't they be more reliable just because they are 'outside' the body?\" No. The whole question rests on the level to which the discarnate consciousness rises as a result of its net \"earnings\" from the physical lifetime. The communication \"you create your own reality\" most frequently comes fiom a particularplane, that which we may call the \"antechamber\" of the Astral."},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Flypaper Dreaming: The Night's Sweet Prints To understand that plane, you have to realize that under most ordinary circumstances of physical death, consciousness is simply transferred to a version of the overall memory-record etched in more \"durable\" materials. That memory-record acts as the program of an automatic dream for the departed consciousness. The \"program\" is projected in condensed, symbolic fom on the screen of the Astral medium. The Astral is itselfthe natural dimension of dreaming for physically-focused conscious- ness, though it comprises a real world of experience and characteristic value in its own right (exhibiting the symbolizing properties that are \"borrowed\" in the composition of familiar sub-con- scious dreamlife). The energies and dimensional patterns that naturally inform the features of the Astral in itself, imparting its unique character, are not immediately employed in the disclosure of true astral scenes where the consciousness of the \"deceased\" is concerned. The \"deceased\" does not as a rule directly perceive the astral environs as it exists its own descriptive features; instead, the base of astral energies and dimensional patterns serves to infuse the record of memory-impres- sions composing the characteristic \"identity\" of the departed personality. In this way the personality \"dreams\" for a time a very condensed, symbolic summary of the chronic features of the life just lived. It is only after the elapse of \"psychic time\" in juicing the images of their residual hold on identification, and with the help of Other-world guides, that the personality is able to establish suflicient \"distance\" or psychic perspective from the shadowed scenes of the dream-mind to strike an adequate, threshold spark of self-reflective awareness in that medium to \"know the difference\", to perceive this is not the habitat of waking physical life and that in all probability the ego-subject has died. Fixing The Holes (To Stop My Mind From Wandering) The astral energies supporting composite dream-sequences of the former ''waking life\", however, do not immediately withdraw and return to direct duty organizing astral patterns of perception; rather, the personality remains fixed for a time in fascination to the projected dream- scape. The subject, now sufficiently serf-aware, is intrigued by the unreality, the actual plasticity of what it had formerly taken to be physical fact. Finding the resources of willed imagination under sponsorship of that conscious spark, the subject commences to bend the newly malleable images into confonnance with whim and desire. It discovers it needn't reexperience indefinitely the memory-repetitions of painful circumstance or unresolved psychological fact. It realizes quite happily it can transform the outcome and contributing characteristics of anything recalled, making Dad deeplyfirlflled at the otherwise ulcerous job that forced him to be \"hard to live with\", making Mom more vocal in her encouragement and appreciation. Eventually, with the imaginative resolution of these scenes and concomitant catharsis of the psyche, the picture projected fiom the personal memory-record may be folded up and packed away, the energies that had sustained it withdrawing to participate in the direct productions of Astral imagery."},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Light Of Glory, Lights Of Glamor: Death's Not Yet Well Met At this point, hovering as the self-reflective spark of awareness on the border between mnemonic patterns of physical reality and the Astral domain proper, the personality may proceed upward--and progressively--into the Light (the global character of which impartially \"weighs\" every mental impression of the conserved Identity and pronounces the judgment of the Balance, an experience reported as an encounter with \"Christ in the Godlight\" etc.); or the discarnate ego-subject may linger temporarily, fascinated fiom its perspective by the dream-character of physical reflections it's tending to receive in the astro-etheric light. In this way the subject may be attracted to an actual, physical locale and an incarnate personality. Where the respective systems are sufficiently harmonious and potentially \"attuned\" the discarnate consciousness may discover it's able to effect a quasi-physical impression on the embodied counterpart. Presently, the alerted \"meditator\" in the physical system becomes a fascinated \"channeler\" for the psyche hovering in the astro-etheric system. Realking the potential for \"impressing\" as comparatively Godlike fiom the vantage of this subtle energy-perspective, the discarnate personality doesn't fail to assume the cloak, thereby becoming the wisdom-philosopher of the astral dream-tricks about which it has just learned. Teaching The Dream: The Futile Forestalling Of Ego-Death But what it has just learned, came fiom a simple course in dream-management. It had learned how to rearrange psychic furniture of the chronic dream-habitat, so as to resolve certain tensions and fictional complexes that had fhstrated--to a degree--the expression of its creative potential in life. It had learned what basically may be learned while still incarnate, through \"lucid dreaming\". What it believes it has learned, however, is the result of having quickly forgotten the refractory character of actual physical existence that always fully incorporates and creatively embodies every side of the psychic equation, so as to live out the complement of its complex implications. Assuming, with astral-philosopher's hat poised firmly o'er orgone brow, that there's a basic identity of pattern-behavior between the dream \"antechamber\" of the actual Astral World and light-bathed features of the obliquely-perceived \"physical\", the discamate personality (with many accompanying claims on behalf of its own enlightenment) will proceed to pontificate as to the evident validity regarding the way in which \"you create your own reality\". The channeler will then pass on the information, professing he is merely a conduit of this \"inspired\" material but that if he has \"succeeded in making anyone's life a little lighter\" he will have received \"reward enough\", along with his regular consultation fee."},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV What IS he mother Current? )) Part I-The Mother According to the Spiritual Description of the Father )) Part 11--Out Of Left Field: A Spiritual Biography of AAA and MT )) Part 111-Why You Needn't Buy the Father's Line PART l The Mother According To The Spiritual Description Of The Father What is the Mother-current? It's the name we give an Initiatory Power. And what's an \"initiatory power\"? We're not utterly unfamiliar with the concept or at least the nomenclature, if we have any brush with the Spiritual Traditions at all, for the Perennial teaching as compiled alike fiom all great spiritual traditions, schools and cultures makes collective reference to a feminine principle variously designated as \"consort\", \"goddess\", \"mother\" etc. The question is then, whether that which is referred to as the Mother-current is the same as or comparable to the reference of the traditions. It's first of all notable that from the fund of \"comparative religion\" we can derive a representative description of what the ancients understood as the \"feminine\". It should be under- stood however that the extant version of this description, while lendmg gentle credence to some such principle as Jung's \"universal archetype\", is tinctured by millennia1 dominance of the Patriarchate, of which our current civilization is only the most recent expression. Evidentially, what we know of the tradition of thefeminine is first of all appropriated fiom survivalist adhesions of an even earlier or prehistoric Matriarchate, as witnessed for example in Minoan ruins at the site of ancient Crete. An even more specialized aspect of recovering this traditional description (for a comparison with what we presently mean by the initiatory Mother-current), is that the \"mythic\" profile emerging from witness of collated materials represents a more subtle knowledge than is suggested by the interpretation of \"primitive storytelling\". Ancient cultures fiom which such symbolism and mythic narration derives, possessed in common a spirit4 technology for which our secular, separativist explanations are inadequate. To understand what the ancients meant by their collective \"feminine\" images in terms of spiritual technology, is itself a job of exegesis suited to initiated insight. Initiated insight is privileged in the sense that it observes and interprets from the inside, rather than by exterior and thus superficial survey. Initiated wisdom is adapted to know what the ancients meant through their collective Mother mythos; thus it's possible to appreciate what initiated wisdom presently intends in its designations of \"Mother-principle\", by noting the way in which that special perspective views such value across the critical transition of Time. It's also important to note, in our encapsulation of the \"secret\" or subtle thesis of ancient understanding, that the descriptive terminology employed is shaped from experience and the"},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV interlocked requirements of apresent initiatory insight; it has been generated in practical tenns as a sufficiently flexible lexicon to do justice without distortion to the patriarchal sense of the subtle tradition, while relating with or even extending (without succumbing to) the special imperatives of our \"scientific\" vocabulary etc. Our \"wording\" of the collective description may be considered an experimental bridge, something not so much like any particular exposition fiom the standard framework but sufficiently consonant with those keys to strike some \"familiarizing\" notes linking old dictions with surprising likenesses of the new. First of all then, what do our collective ancient traditions mean by the Mother-principle? Why do we find such concord amongst disparate times and places, so there emerges so obvious a parallel between the \"descent of Ishtar through the spheres\", the \"fall of Nous\" in the gnostic description, the charging of the Hebrew Throne-Chariot into the turbulent abyss and the encoiling of Sakti in the form of Kundaiini? The Mother According To The Father, On His Best Behavior The collective initiatory narrative of the ancients indicates the \"feminine\" principle as a primary creative power of Absolute (God, Spirit, the Divine etc. characterized as \"masculine\", with several interesting deviations hung over fiom the Matriarchate). The \"business\" of this creative power is to celebrate the value of that absolute Spirit in innumerable Ways, to find within itself a Means of giving limitless expression to the Tmth of its overarching Reality. Thus the creative power, in its birthing of all the terms of manifestation now designated \"Mother\", carries forward the unitive value of Spirit-consciousness through formal representation or expressive parallel. At first then the Creative pays close homage to the homogeneity and limitless wholeness of Spirit by transcribing its thorough Void-being in the mirror correspondence of a dense overspill across all the possible crevices and accommodating spaces of manifestation, polarizing the potential complementaries of \"features\" (or mutually delimiting qualities) in indiscriminate global profusion; in this way \"she\" emulates featureless Absolute through distribution of her myriad possible extensions across a spontaneously self-cancelling symmetry of equipotential \"radii\", on a universal scale. At this primary level all things actively and immediately celebrate their divine origin through overt coinherence, interpenetration, perfect parity of interchange and mutual identification at the juncture of their common birth, their touchpoint and collective reference in the zero-wne of \"invariant global rotation\". In this way the creative power adheres as closely as possible in \"ornamentation of the Creator\", according to the Hebrew tradition; she furnishes the adorning \"bangles\" of the Sakti, according to descriptively similar narration of Hinduism. For \"some reason\", however, about which the ancients are never quite clear, this primary creative power employs her initial \"created totality\"-celebrating its divine origin as a continuous void-dance in voidance of all preferential value, direction or dimension--in polarizing along emphasized angles of orientation, thereby producing a discreted system of \"symmetries\" (permit- ting-by inference---the introduction of \"anisometric ratios\" through any axis intersecting at an oblique plane across the perturbed interstices). This fractionating geomeny greatly multiplies the potential of what may be produced in the manifest field; for, fiom the equipotential appearance of \"everything\" there's now drawn a distinct possibility of progressively masking, or screening fiom"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV immediate self-perception the essential void-character of all polar proliferating property. Through such emphasiid angles of orientation the feminine power endows itself with the creative capacity to generate systems of triangulating foci establishing \"positionality\" or perspective; and, fiom the compound grid-network spun through such shuttle weave there's built the basis of a reflection-axis emphasizing one plane of symmetry over another, so establishing the possibility of direction or variable ratios of extension in the homogeneity and continuity of Space. Celebratory Bole According to the voice of our ancient narrators, this feminine creative power& one form or another--carries forward the whole value of Spirit-consciousness in absorptive cross-stitch- ing of polar properties along the vertically-distributed extent of her potentiated Axis. Such \"axis\" becomes the World-tree or Middle Pillar, the Yggdrasil or Lodge-pole of the traditions; fiom the equipotential voiddance of her primary manifestation in supersaturated symmetry of self-cancelling poles, the creative power processes a progressively discreting system of frltrate planes and masked fields, so that a vertically-arranged hierarchy of dimensions with distinctive values of energy, form and matter are sifted out-strained through the \"colander\" of the cross-sectional grid pattern coaxially aligned in compound focal adjustment of diversified, perceptual venues. She is in this way compared to the Cosmic Spider weaving her treacherous web of the world, the Spinstress Maya fashioning the captious maze of distractive illusion luring the whole- Identity of Spirit consciousness fatefully \"offcenter\". Having spun this enchanting net of crystal- line pattern (polarizing the operative planes of tension for various organizations of energy and matter), the busy Sakti, Mother of the Worlds, is said to invert through her own focal network and settle in the very midst of her creation, at the farthest extreme from her original celebratory sphere faithfully mirroring the informing Value of Absolute. There is then in effect established a Pole, if we view the collective image clearly; at one end of the vertical pole, at its illustrious Crown, there may still be viewed the origmal state of equipotential Void-symmetry characterizing the virgin condition of the field of manifestation, distributed in global adoration and uniform homage with respect to the sacred Standard of Its origin. The Primal Arrangement of the I Ching trigrams enshrines this original formula, as well as the Cross of St. John with its oppositely paired elements. This primary creative Matrix of Mulaprakriti, the Qabalist's Throne, /-- \\ may thus be considered \"stationary\" as -\\ a self-adjustive equilibration of symmet- rically arrayed values; though possessing the burgeoning potential of all possible 2!! \"features\", it faithfully reflects the ho- mogeneity of featureless absolute and so abides in \"static\" form. It's for this rea- son that, as reflected in the initial Sea of / v Glass or material-mirror of Spirit, the Supreme Principle itself is considered eternally moveless. \"Siva\" is said to reside without stirring at the summit of this World-axis. The Pole itself represents the dynamic extension or progressive \"disequilibration\" of the primordial qualities as effect of the ingenious system of crystalline facets, mutually mirroring-"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV in maenad multiplication along split-image corridors of infinite regress--the complementary \"anisomerisms\" (produced through coordinate networks of compound focal triangulation). This is the Sakti or Mother-creator in her active phase because it represents the \"length of the Pole\" as the intermediate, patterning worlds reflected in one another in an unsettled state, shimmering as prototypal forms tentatively profiling plastic molds, standing in for variable \"fittings\" etc. These worlds and planes are constitutionalZy unstable, faceted reflections like flickering scales of light on the surface of water since they are the proper domains of the Variable--building layers of value in terms of probability-intensification and so serving in a sense as fields richly enweaving the central principle of indeterminacy, manifesting nature's mode of incorporating basic void-value. The presence of \"indeterminacy\" woven all through that fabric, signifies the integral factor offieedom within every such pattern. Such a factor offieedom spun cleverly into the cloth holds a hallowed place open for the incorporative spirit of Will, borrowed from the Presence of consciousness along the central channel. Through this vertical midsection or universal \"thorax\" then, the Sakti exercises the fonnulative faculty, continuously serving as a variable energy sensitively-responsive to fluctuating emphases of intention and volition and so carrying those values of consciousness forward in \"astral\" processes of patterning. Sakti-Latrodectus Settles Down We meet the \"static\" form of the universal Value again, as minor image at the foot of the vertical Pole, when we consult the ancient description telling of the reflexive inversion of the creative Matrix upon herself--situating herself as it were like a spider at the center of her own web of creation. This means to tell us, in effect, that the self-evident Standard of reality-divine Spirit-consciousness-has been drawn through the weaving process of the Mother's enchanted webwork along the extent of the Pole or universal Axis, everting the creative properties resident in its eternal All-potential until the whole-value of its absolute Identity is drawn offside and invested in delimited forms of its own, representative patterning. The Mother has, like the Black Widow, dragged her mate into the midst of her enchantment, spell-biding the Whole value of divine Identity in identified allegiance to an oblique-angle perspective (mirroring the most \"opaque\" or anisometrically-lopsided fkmework of facultative focus involving the optimum resistance, inertia and uncompensated pressure of the tangible realm of \"touch\"). This essentially psychic value, modeling a whole universe of meaning around the qualities of separation, density, unyielding obscuration and impenetrability, is simply the mirror obverse of Reality's ultimate Adamantine, its Diamond-vajra \"incompressibility\" or self-same, changeless consistency under all conditions; yet as manifested exclusively in the narrowed field of expression, it serves to musk that immediate (and unmediated) Self-knowing which is indicated in the Tibetan diamond-vajra, substituting instead the Sakti7s most ingenious, inverse version of that Supreme Value: the leaden obstruction ofthe emulative element earth, the most incompressible and unyieldingly \"self-same\" of all the creative powers. In this way the Sakti, all-Mother of the Universe, exchanges her \"upper world\" role as subservient and adoring Revelator of the Void-value of Spirit-consciousness through saturate symmetry of her beautifidly self-cancelling tern, for the role of treacherous Black Widow, weaver of the veiling web or curtain (\"pargod\") of Maya in exact mirror-reversal of her Upper function-"},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV drawing the whole-value of Absolute Spirit-consciousness into illusory subservience to the very patterns she'd first produced to reflect and affirm Him. The image of this Mother-dragon curling up, as it were, with Omboric tail in her mouth in the midst of creation, indicates the coded lockin of the variable focal adjustments structuring the (multidimensional) axis, so that at its perspectival extreme in exclusive down-focus toward the limit of object resolution it achieves a predictable consistency of pattern; it merges the variable upshot of all-convergent-adjustments fiom the \"upper\" registries of its own axis, toward a uniform typology of cycles and cognizable attributes. The Sakti settles at the extreme end or emergent ''tail\" of her processes, as a self-consistent code into which all infeeding variables are uniformly structured. Curling Up Her Complex \"Locks\" Through such programmed patterns of mnemonic repetition she compacts a stable energy-nucleus summarizing and setting her elemental ratios; that tension-packed coil serves thereafter to monitor the organizational currents through which are keyed the mutually modeling- and reciprocally reinforcing--grids of cognitive and perceptual impression ordering the \"fixed\" form of the physical world. (This overturned order of things is represented in the Inner World or Later Heaven arrangement of I Ching trigrams, and in the Cross of Ezekiel altemting the distribution of opposites around a circle). When this universal process a (proceeding down and along the cosmic axis through which all worlds of energy and orgahtion converge) is ultimately reflected through the stylized grid-net- work of perceptual coding as dace pro- jection of the \"physical world\", that axis perceives itself--in comparatively flat monoplane cross-section-+ the human form with its vertical, cerebrospinal structure. Through such projective dace appearance all the plexuses, ganglia, nervous networks and internal organs distributed along that axis seem to \"take their being\" in a common dimension, - processing their respective patterns as services of separate functions in a homogenous plane of reality. Through this projective reflection (secretly regulated at the nuclear core of the encoiled kundalini-sakti as mnemonic \"habit-pattern\") there is no sense of the multidimensional character of the cerebrospinal axis. There is no sense that such axis is a universal structure through which all energy, form; function, instrumentality and matter is organized, rather than an incidental ambulatory stalk ensconced \"inside\" a world of competitive objects. There is no sense that human conscious- ness, focally fixated to its narrow perspe&val field, & through the mediating model and common denominator of all form rather than through one accidental evolutionary pattern amongst others of equivalent \"non-necessity \".

Thus the Sakti, settled into congruence with the cleverly compounded perceptual grid of the \"physical world\" and so apparently residing internal to the monoplane anatomy at the sacral base and coccygeal plexus, is conceived by ancient convention as \"fixed\" at this extreme as well, unmoving in mirror inversion of the Moveless etedty belonging to the Standard of Spirit-con- sciousness \"above\" (and so correspondingly aligned with the head-region of the flat physical anatomy). Nestled at this fixed position, the coil of kundalini regulates and routinely adjusts the pattems of currents summed fiom centers along the mind-body axis; the interlocking order of subconscious processes monitors, in turn, key functional ratios in the (variable) organization of perceptual and cognitive grids. Ordering The Perceptual Menu This \"secret\" link between the operative ratios in the interaction of subconscious/auto- nomic processes and the programmed patterning of perception, while unknown to present science may be unlocked at the physical end of things through the unsolved \"black box\" mystery of the bulboreticular formation. It's known to current neuroanatomy that, for some unexplained reason, the autonomic nerve-bundles enter one end of the reticular terminal while the sensory currents of the cortex enter the other: what happens where they invisibly \"meet\", is the physical avenue of approach to the problem which initiated vision perceives directly as a multidimensional process, linking the governing elemental ratios of autonomic interaction with values that encode the given states of sensation and perception we identi@ as consistent impression of a \"material\" world. It's for this reason we ought to value more closely the advice of Castaneda's don Juan when he explains that we're really nothing but a \"bubble of perception\"+ince \"perception\" is a particular grammar of cognition it might be better to describe us as in reality a \"bubble of cognition\", but in any case the point remains that-- fact4ere aren't a bunch of separate processes serving different if related functions--there's only one process serving one function regardless whether we breathe or digest, etc., and that is the process which serves the function of cognition/perception. We may understand from this also that, though the kundalini-sakti is described as \"fixed\" at its lockin-locale at the spinal base, this is only aprovisional fixity. There is no exclusive or fixed \"physical world\" in itself, for the standardized--and stabilized-cognition of a physical world may now be understood as contingent expression of a network of quite variable functions, plexuses, pattems and current-processes. This then is the basis of the ancientlperennial insistence, in the spiritual traditions, that the apparent conscious \"arrest\" of this focal worldsrder is not a necessary or permanent condition. This accounts for the insistence of these traditions that we can modzfi our perception of \"the world\", vcny to greater or lesser degree our whole-apparently captive-relation to it, and even operate its pattems in such a way as tofiee ourselves fiom their seemingly \"solid\" hold! It is in this way we may understand those counsels of the spiritual traditions with which we are most \"familiar\"; for every such counsel, (whether treating the human condition in tern of"},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the \"exiled Shekinah\" of God resting in the desert of existence as the Divine Footstool orthe parallel padmasan, identically \"footstool\" in Sanskrit and referring to the encoiled Saki at the spinal base) insists such energy can be liberated, unequivocally released fiom its locus in auspicious return of displaced powers and recessed patterns to their rightful locales, restoring the plexiform sites or sacred centers to their functional potential and finally, infusing the extent of the multidimensional spine to the degree of drawing congruent again with its initial state in harmony withfill-conscious Value at the very summit of the World-axis. Usually the traditions are in agreement that this restorative release is a progressive ascent in sequential \"return\" along the path of former descent; they are also in basic harmony with the idea that this liberative restoration of the Mother-principle (encountered in the form of the anastomosed \"nature-current\" locking the world in place with its tail in its mouth) is equivalent of illuminated Consciousness, the awakening of unqualified Spirit to its own essential reality etc. Restoring The Mother's Real Estate: Examining The Run-Down Premises What is not so well understood is that these ancient systems of thought and practice carried forward as spiritual instruction for today, have not seen the times of their primary experimentation from which the originating plans were \"drawn up\" for literal ages; instead they derive the renewal or confirmatory reinforcement of empirical data and practical results fiom the point-ofdeparture of an initialpremise, a code or guideline comprising a categorial mandate at the outset. The basic theory on which the practice is predicated, is then an unexamined given in the sense that it has been many a millennia since the fertile era of its initial experimentation. The fact that this primary experimentation is neither recognized as a contingent source or assumed as critical/foundational datum, lies in the circumstance that \"results\" tend to follow in consequence of the selected lines of practice. The premise of the practice establishes the conditions of its repeated confirmation, and the results are interpreted in terms of the premise. It is a self-reinforcing, self-fullilling process in the same general way that physicists expect results according to the selected mode of observation. This ambiguous variable condition of the observa- tion-process is, however, not a basic part of the perennial \"vocabulary\" of knowledge on the subject re esoteric function. Indeed the standard supposition on the subject is surprisingly allied to \"naive realism\". What is more important to understand is that the predictable, conforming reflection of the initial premise in the ultimate result is not equivalent to the automatic verification of the result with respect to Reality. The premise does not @so facto define reality (for if it did, then any result following any premise would constitute a suil'icient reality and make of every New Ager the unimpeachable \"reality creator\" he supposes himself to be!); the premise, rather, always defines the means of obtaining a result that can be gauged in its adequacy against the independent operative of Reality. Reality is the Whole Standard, and its Wholeness bears demons~able consequences toward any \"proof' or result measuring itself against that spontaneous/irreducible presence. What this means is that the yogi claiming awakened nature-current \"sakti\" to be the same as Consciousness or God, has not created his own privately self-consistent and therefore unimpeachable reality when he occasions that targeted \"awakening\"; he has rather produced a particular result fiom the seed of his initial premise, and that result now exists as a certain magnitude"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV with consequential property only measurable in the first place against the independent Standard and infoxming frslmework of Reality. That the yogi may \"force the case\" tofit the framework of reality against the outcropping of a contrary evidence, simply shows the yogi's continued kinship with the rest of humanity that similarly spends much time and effort squeezing the embarrassing dimensions of reality into a container inadequate to the task. What allows the yogi (and all others) to persist in self-delusion, is unexamined acceptance of the idea that any correspondence of result with the initiating premise in itself confirms and reinforces the validity of the premise! What happens when Reality pulls further and further fiom the conditions that pemit provisional sustaining of the illusion? The need for reevaluation becomes more evident As with modern times it becomes progressively apparent that a return to the basis of primary experimentation is called for; a reassessment of the underlying premises of all such traditional practices is the more manifestly mandatory. When the need for such reassessment reaches a certain, universal scale as in the present where mutual global exposure of every local practice shows some peculiar anomaly in the initially \"delightful\" overlap (raising inevitable questions against the shared premises) the overall state of psychic \"critical mass\" takes the initiative, waiting on no particular notice by any particular party but simply generating the conditions of a kind of spontaneous return-to-starting-point. PART II Out Of Left Fie1d:A Spiritual Biography Of AAA And MT Such were precisely the circumstances under which MT and AAA found themselves functioning, without necessarily understanding the implication till much later, when in 1973 after a preliminary \"season\" of intense spiritual work within traditional frameworks there was a sudden eruption of responsive p~ychic and clearly spirid phenomena as if the pressurized contents of a vacuum container had suddenly yielded to the prying of an \"opener\". The culmination of this abrupt surplus of \"experiential data\" occurred in the summer of '74 when A&4 was manifestly Initiated, in daylight hours in a totally awakened state, by the insurgence fiom \"higher planes\" (with which they'd been communicating) of a self-luminous Spiritual Master. The \"appearance\" of this Inner Plane Master right in their living room inaugurated an accelerated time of spiritual learning and experimentation. (AAA could see and describe him directly; MT could regularly observe an intensified luminance in the room even under conditions of darkness where there was no external light source, and always knew the presence of the Master even in advance by a distinct pressure or altered sense of orientation efficiently focused at the back of the head.) First of all, on the basis of their practicing lcnowledge of esoteric and spiritual \"controls\", they safeguarded the ongoing sanctity of their working by testing the authenticity of this special Appearance. This Inner Plane Master not only proved out perfectly on every point, but established what should clearly be recognized as the hallmark of an authentic teacher, embodied or disembodied, in that (through his ongoing communication) he provided a general system of principles and guidelines proving themselves to be a much more accurate measure of the authenticity and Balance of a spiritual instructor/instruction than is commonly furnished by standard available sources! The"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV application of such principles not only to his own communication and their interpretation of it, but to other instructions in general exhibited the special power to clarify, sort and resolve that establishes itself as graciously self-evident. Indeed the extended period in which they maintained such initiatory communication with AAA's Inner Plane Master may function as a model of the genre; and, if properly appreciated for that which it makes rationally self-evident ought to serve in holding an ideal light to the patterns projected by all subsequent and current \"channelings\", \"contacts\" etc. Rules For A Cryptic Gameboard: Spirit Guides, Channels And Inner Plane Masters First of all, this was not a \"channeling\"; it was not a \"contact\" with some unseen UFO, nor was it the same as practice with a \"spirit guide\". Spirit guides, most channeled sources and all UFO contacts are involvements with beings at certain intermediate stages of their own development; and while any such stage may be helpful fiom the perspective of the seeker's own stage, there are manifest grey areas and gaps whichmay or may not be evident to the seeker due to the developmental status of the communicating source (we are of course only speaking of such things under their most positive potential). An Inner Plane Master is by defnition Enlightened, awakened in the optimum sense that the teaching-function of such a being always proceeds fiom the whole-value of Consciousness Absolute, always orients the practitioner by the greatest economy of means and insistence of Intent toward recognition and valuation of that Standard, and in practice proves its authenticity by its b'jealous\" guardianship of that Standard against any divergent tendency toward intermediate aims to which the student--in his partial vision--is continuously susceptible. An her Plane Master is disembodied, belonging to orders oftimelspace, and is therefore functioning through a \"milieu\" of hdamentally different potential, orientation and \"atmospheric pressure\" than any being operating fiom zones of spacetime of which ours is one example (the distinction between orders of timelspace and spacehime is important and the two-part article on Channeling, UFOs, etc--October-November---should be consulted for clarification. Much in the way of misperception and speculative confusion--cf. the review of \"War in Heaven\", this issue--could be cleared away if would-be commentators and \"spiritual analysts\" would bone up on the actual, underlying structure of things-better still, would stay their tongues and resist the temptress Profit till they knew firsthand whereof they spoke, by the indispensable method of Working in Silence and respect till their chakras fell off?) Any such authentic master or teacher of the Inner Planes, functioning fiom the timelspace order of reality which is \"helpfully\"--in a certain sense--disjunct fiom our own (so the awakened being is fiee of the distractive imperatives and peculiar limits to which the embodied condition is inevitably subject) nonetheless honors the law of such parallel-plane disjunction by ignoring the concrete details, the specific \"mechanics\" of things in the pressing immediacy of their concern as we experience it. Such a Teacher establishes a criterion and testable standard for all \"extraordinary\" communication of the type whether fiom orders of timelspace or spaceltime--as long as they are at a remove fiom our own embodied density* that he steadfastly abjures specific or ad hoc \"advice\"; such a Teacher, tellingly, never advises on \"the market\", where to move to avoid the Big One, what pet to buy or music to listen to, and in fact his instruction is firmly based on general"},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV principles with the addition of occasional, testable variables of a particular type to illuminate the Law in practice. It is the teaching of these basic spirihral principles which distinguishes the authenticity of the communication above anything else; for the Purpose of Awakened Consciousness is ever to impart the gyroscopic standard of orientation possessing maximum elasticity-of-adaptation under every circumstance while clearly never relinquishing its Unitive reference-point. It is through the deep learning, incorporation and introjection of such principles that the practitioner is furnished unerring means of making his own concrete decisions, enforcing his own determinations without anaclitic reference to any source. This is the only way Consciousness can legitimately stand consciousness on its feet, set its footsteps unerringly to right on the path of its own liberation. (Embodied teachers distinguish the value of their Awakening by promulgating such first-principles also, with the addition that they may advance more specific advice in keeping with their shed status in 3rddensity embodiment along with the student provided the advice is always bed in, and functions as illus~ation oJ some such universal principle which the student may subsequently apply on his own.) During this period ranging over half the '70s decade, AAA and MT were furnished the first-principles and experimental \"functions\" with which to perform a work that, in retrospect, constitutes exactly that return to the Fount of primary experimentation called for by the general Times, the critical state of consciousness at large and the manifestly limited means furnished through the spiritual traditions. Pyramid Initiation And The Sealing Of A Psychic Power During an especially intense and manifestly Sacred initiatory occasion with the Inner Plane Master, AAA was taken out of the body to \"Egypt\", the locale of a kind of Astral Pyramid wherein she was ceremoniously wrapped with bandages of light; after which, on recovering consciousness in the body, she found herself to be permanently impressed with an extraordinary faculty of \"aura reading \". This faculty proved to be far more powerfbl than any about which they'd read, including the celebrated faculty of Leadbetter, et al.; and it was certainly more profound than anything demonstrated at the various \"psychic fairs\" to which they were invited during that time due to their"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV gathering notoriety. Yet their basic use of AAA's extraordinary \"talent\" wasn't centered on the occasional public demonstrations or private consultations she'd give, almost always for fiee; rather under general guidance of the Inner Plane Master they were led to make direct, primary experimen- tation upon the centers, currents, energies and fields to which she had observational access. In this way they were able to employ the significant counterbalance of male/female polarity in observing, registering and inducing various processes of the mindhody being ordinarily \"hidden\" or indirectly lmown through surgical exploration of the gross-physical projection. They were able to make primary experimentation upon those practices of breath-control, asana, concen- tration etc. passed forward by tradition and long taken for granted, and all independent of the conditioning theory in which such practices came marinated. This was afirndamentally different process than the ordinary order of development wherein the student is furnished a practice blind which, if maximally successful, makes him ultimately the \"master\" by inducing the desired subtle perception enabling more direct witnessing of the effect or results of the particular practice; for in such case what is \"seen\" is already thoroughly conditioned by, and gestated from, the initial conceptual seedling, and obediently reflects the qectation rather than the facts. If for example the practitioner expects at the end of his practice to \"see Krishna\" the energy generated through his practice will obediently fiame the anticipated Beautifid Blue Body of Krishna as accommodating product; the energy involved is real energy, the image produced is a real image, as definite perhaps as an ordinary perceptual image of the physical eyes--but the expectation has nonetheless enlisted these \"real things\" in manufacture of a typology that freights much implication which just isn't true in terms of actual awakening, alignment, balance, conscious insight etc. The Image has been manufactured as the expected product of the practice, the \"purpose\" of the instrumental energy-magnification; but the actual net product of such subtle-energy development does not correspond to the symbolic idealism of the image, does not equate on any one-to-one basis with the values represented in the condensed symbolism of the figure. Through this implicit return to primary experimentation free of bracketing doctrine, AAA and MT were enabled to perform a basic work offirst principles allowing the observable energy-currents, fields of force, subtle centers and instruments to disclose the effect of their activity at the outset, and to accurately demonstrate the exact potential inherent in any given idea, technique or complex of methodologies. Characteristically, they performed a laborious and exhaustive research over a period of Y-- AAA First Sounds The \"Deguello\" Importantly, AAA re&ed to stop halfway or be sidetracked in her singleminded pmuit of the ultimate Truth of Life, even when such lures were easy to rationalize as a necessary phase in acceptance of offers to support them--for example+elieving them of pressing financial burdens to pursue their work without worry over their children. Recognizing the hidden fatality of all such \"temptations\"--they were at one point offered unrestrained run of the New Age facilities of a La Jolla doctor who was impressed with her powers to the degree of possession-frenzy-AAA consistently demurred from the easier road that would have inevitably \"cashed in\" a faculty which, in its development, was far more perfected than the final offedng of most who plied a living probing \"aural\" secrets. 626"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV When you choose the \"hard road\" what you receive is hardship (rather than reward for your integrity); such hardship however becomes an integral and necessary element of practice during certain critical stages, andfinishes the only sure test as to whether what has been learned has been understood to the extent of successful application. So it was that they continued their experimentation, but in progressive solitude since more and more friends and former \"supporters\" grew impatient that there was increasingly no end in sight, and only a more final refusal on their part to capitalize or convert the whole process into a fixed \"concession\". On the contrary they were merely becoming more confirmed in their attitude that those amongst their friends and acquaintances who did indeed indulge the exploitation of some \"learning\" or \"talent\" in the Psychic domain, ought to drop such business immediately as an allegation of responsibility for which they simply weren't qualified. Indeed, AAA and MT were at this stage showing signs of that most unwelcome characteristic of the irredeemably committed: the more that was actually known about a subject, the less tolerance was displayed for the level of superficiality tacitly allowed amongst those who have no idea what's really required. Especially in relation to \"subject-matter\" of such ultimate moment as the Spiritual Field of the Soul's own domain, AAA and MT were becoming ... well, impossibly uncompromising and indeed infuriate people to this day for the same unbending trait. Since their unspoken motto and mutual resolve had been, fiom the very beginning it now seems, that of \"never stop along the way, not even to catch your breath\", they continued in isolation--in effect only tangibly manifesting the displacement of negligible wardrobes hm closets that filled in preference of fat notebooks chronicling the months and years of first-hand experimen- tation, observation and change, journals in the slow mounting process of procedurally awakening those qualities through which an ever-more definitive resolution of the known, learned and unlearned could be accomplished. \"Aura\" Is From The Greek, Meaning Breath As one of the testable variables to be gauged through application of appropriate principles, the Inner Plane Master \"suggested\" a variety of breaths to be practiced by MT, and observed in their interior effects by AAA. Through this unique form of \"hands-on marketing research\" certain surprising evaluations were made on the traditional \"products\", (certain \"brands\" not operating as conventionally advertised and some interesting revisions made on matters long thought closed, on accounts long presumed to be paid). It was in this way for example the fundamental value of Power Breathing and its basic unit the Charger Breath was struck upon as possessing the most generally effective, balanced and potentiating \"presence\" of all the known techniques kclusive of suggested variations. Ail modeled techniques were given fair opportunity to \"show their stuff', even if this meant as it often did that research on a particular practice wasn't concluded for years; every reasonable measure was taken to isolate the effects of each practice so the employment of one didn't distort the impression produced by the next. Indeed AAA's interior or \"aural\" perception was so acute she quickly came to identify the characteristic \"signature\" of each breathing process so their respective influences could be the more easily sorted. The Power Breath was immediately identified, for example, as a form potent to take instantaneous command of the energy of the entire room, moving the currents of the enveloping space like a tidal magnetism."},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"Over time their developmental work with energy-fields and biopsychic cments took on a deeper reciprocation, as the practices with which MT carefully experimented (as well as the continued initiatory presence of the Inner Plane Master) gradually enhanced his own powers of \"interior\" perception in a manner appropriate to the specific organization of his systems. Indeed they learned that each personal midbody system adapts to a characteristic mode of interaction with respect to the deep fields of energy and matter. In this way he was able to \"locate\" certain zones or states of energy in the extended field of perception and isolate them interiorly, at the locus of the \"third eye\"; he could with concentrative practice \"interrogate\" such modes of energy, to the degree they'd unfold like flowers to the ray of his attention modeling their subtler details. He found that by Mind there exists a means of engaging the psychic value of any fom of energy or state of matter, in such a way as to be able to slow its process fantastically for minute inspection, virtually arrest it at any \"angle\" or in relation to any coupled field or quality so as to analyze its order and then to know it--through this unsuspected, willed variabiiity-as a function of the efficient \"saturation\" of attention aligning its flickering \"moments\". Such deeper integration with the \"psychic field\" inevitably manifested in their work taking on a more psychic quality. The practical ambiguity of perceivable energy-states often challenged the limits to which the analytic faculties could follow or understand; often it seemed that a traced \"cwe\" or current of energy would do something conceptually impossible to grasp, as if deciding suddenly to model the tangible issue of pure paradox. You could \"arrest\" it; you could slap it in irons, stick it in the stockade--but that would simply serve to freezehe the given current in an attitude of mocking perplexity. MT could at such times easily find himself concentrating, meditating, contemplating the unexpected puzzle for hours on end with no greater success in understanding to show for it; and then at dinner AAA would describe to him the vision of a particularly intense field or geometric pattern pressing itself unbidden upon her all during the day, the purpose for which she couldn't fathom, and she'd ask with some expectancy whether it meant anything to him--on hearing the detailed description he'd identify it inevitably as the resolving \"picture\", the explanatory key or coherent whole of what he'd been unable to grasp from the codiring \"perspective\" of his own isolated state. It was not, they came to realize, the limitation of pictographic \"angle\" at the third eye Lens that fivstrated MT's independent apprehension of what the energy-system was actually \"doing\"; the context of his solitary being-in-itself was the ultimate source of limitation rather than any facultative deficiency, so the \"solution\" required the participation and active harmonization of Two. This often applied reciprocally for AAA and her work, so they came to understand the amplifying virtue of malelfemale initiated practice (as opposed to the single, usually male line of development that in fact actually characterized-virtually all--the religious and spiritual traditions of the \"patriarchate\". The probability for developmental imbalance--and thus fatefuliy \"skewed\" description-ultimately emanating from any such source no matter how seemingly \"exalted\" or \"complete\" in its emergence, became acutely apparent to them as they observed firsthand the fiuits of a contrastively mutual working). During the years in which they worked this observationlexperimentation phase, AAA and MT were-from their convergent and complementary perspectives-modeling a whole Vision of the fields of subtle energye-, the centers and chakras and the luminous \"sdion\" of the kundalini with its phosphorescent stalk and gleaming bulb; and they were apprehending these basic"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV underlying energies not in their obedient, a posteriori configuration as reflective effect of certain systematized practices but as they would show through their own innate functions in the form of observable variables--and all this courtesy of the unique Bestowal, in whole or unprecedently complete form, of M's aura reading faculty by the'her Plane Master. The Tree Lights Up: A New Pole Of Planetary Awakening As they practiced according to the optimum balances achieved through studied experi- mentation with the energies, they became beneficiaries of the powers-ofdevelopment belonging to those balances. By irregular jumps, exchanges, starts and stops the centers and meridians of their respective systems amplified the overall intensity of their net \"charge\", blossomed and procedurally aligned in such a way as to yield direct availability of the higher dimensions and states of spiritual being. As the faculties of spiritual Reason and Divine Intuition became more consistently available in result of the ascending Balance, the values of all forces, faculties and instruments thus far enlisted to their service expanded geometrically, each serving to amplify the other in reverberative escala- tion. Through this, and the feedback obtained through limited classes of students they'd occasionally assemble as ongoing beneficiaries of what, so far, they'd learned, it became progres- sively apparent that a work of mutuality between them and the Inner Plane Master was forging a new and complete system, a methodology of \"initiatory meditation\" uniquely suited to the current planetary state of rotating fields and forces. Indeed they learned firsthand (long before reading-con- bation in any \"channeled\" material) that the subtle subtending forces were in a process of millennial tramition having repercussion through the very heart of matter; the actual states of \"nuclear physics\" were being fatefully modified as prelude to a wholesale translation of the sphere into a \"higher density\", and it was progressively clear why deficiencies in the extant-esoteric- practices of the Patriarchate were opening, in the widening breach, to glaring recognition--why also it was necessary for the development of a wholly New Way in keeping with intensified requirements of the transition for which the standard, hand-me-down methods were manifestly inadequate. The \"good news\" embedded in this general imperative, became recognized as the fix$ that the closer integratiow'permeabiiity amongst participating dimensions as result of the transitional breakdown of barriers made potent/transformative energies more directly and easily available to enlightened use-at the same time however that same \"accessibility\" of the higher energy-potencies made foolish use all the more dangerous, as could be found in the majority practices of those whose \"business\" it apparently was to chip off an accessible piece here and there from the shaky spiritual architecture still standing on Patriarchal ground, and sell it to the unwary as if having some proprietary right more legitimate than that of the poacher. The \"deliverance\", through this mutual methodology, of a whole Way of initia- tory/meditative practice was not then the result of a one-way \"conferral\" by the Inner Plane Master of a fixed set of already-defined techniques; indeed they came to appreciate over time that any such \"gratis\" bestowal of pre-formed techniques by any extradimensional source is spiritually inappro- priate, indeed \"breaks the law\", and serves amongst other things to define a captiously negatively source (see the two-part Channeling, UFOs etc., October-November '89 as well as A Modest Proposal, March '90). Rather, this particular \"working\" proved such a point by comparison, for here was an uncommon operation (no examples of such a thing have been found so far in any of"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the available literature) between paired malelfemale initiates embodied in a 3rd-density state, experimentally interacting with an Inner Plane Master in mutually forging-by trial-and-error, feedback correctives under awning of Universal Principles-a new Means of physically-focused Awakening, field-tested and passed by rigorous examination from both Poles! The special circumstance of such \"mutual work\" for a generally-valid and applicable practice of spirituaYesoteric awakening, wasn't fully comprehended at the time by either AAA or MT; only over the course of a developmental decade did it become progressively plainer just why such a thing was allowed. Indeed the \"rule\" is that such a thing simply isn 't allowed-with the exception of the millennially-rare instance it's Intended from the \"beginning\" (i.e. the era's origination-point) that the \"personality\" of the phy sically-embodied pole unfold Complete, i.e. become a wholly Awakened being through whom the power of the Spiritual Totality establishes a thorough grounding at the \"negative\" terminal of the multidimensional axis. For in this way, and only in this way, is the safii and responsible caretakership of the new-formed primary potency Practice guaranteed and func- tionally secured. Indeed this \"exceptional case\" has specifc reference to the integral importance of the physicalpolarity, since the \"material sphere\" is recognized as most critically-significant locale for the probability of whole-being awakening of all the planes and spheres. For this reason AAA and MT were specifically guided to understand early-on that the physiological differentiation of \"male\" and \"female\" at the earthy pole of things has a special spiritual significance and functional application. Vive: La DS6rence The physiological difference corresponds to and houses a spiritual dzzerentid. There is a structural and functional dzrerence in the way awakened male and female b'teterminals\" operate, and in the effects they mediate, through the physical sphere of things. Understanding of this accounts for the peculiar anomaly that there've been apparently few \"female\" adepts, or wholly awakened beings, during the historical course of the patriarchate; and it accounts for such anomaly in a manner making it more than just a negative consequence of patriarchal dominance. It becomes apparent now that the fully awakenedfemale function has awaited the fullness of the historical moment to be drawn into unrestrained operation. The female psycho- physical form has special correspondence with, and significance to, the wholefield of manifestation; it possesses the proper \"console\", so to speak, through which the appropriate adjustive switches may be managed for greatest ease and economy of physical-plane transition. This is the special significance of the \"enlightened female\"; yet the occasion of the truly enlightened, wholly awakenedfemale is necessarily as rare as has traditionally been that of the counterpart male, since the business of Spiritual development is always the most difficult \"business\" of all (owing to the fact that it comprises the only, whole and most comprehensive Purpose for \"being\" altogether). Thus it turns out that, in the wisdom of retrospect, it was AAA all along who was born to comprise the essential \"filament\" informing the awakened physical pole during the millennial time-of-transition. In order to serve that function in fact, she-like every one of her predecessor counterparts of the male-emphasized patriarchate-had to demonstrate in practice a fullness of the essential qualities, the indispensable prerequisites of patience, persistence, courage, love and"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV indomitability under literally impossible obstacles; to that end, the Test of such qualities began when it became compellingly apparent a necessary factor of whole-being awakening involved initiatory infusion and grounding through the polarity of a physicafly-embodied Master. Tutelage of an Inner Plane Master was not, had never been nor would ever be enough! for the Inner Plane Master regardless the special virtues of that \"perspective\" doesn't share full \"chakra correspondences\" in common with embodied beings of the physical dimension. So it was that, with positively driven dispatch and remorseless determination AAA set about \"locating\" such embodied Adeptship of the highest possible stage; through such ferocity she quickly found two, and for part of her Work had to go to India to fulfill the necessary connection. A Fateful Crossing Of Planes It was at this point that the Universe began detonating its land-mines, dropping its disconcerting bombs. The morning after AAA left their San Diego home and arrived in India at the ashram of the master, she heard the news of what, up to that time, was the worst airline disaster in the history of manned flight; early that morning a Cessna had struck a full passenger plane and both had crashed in flames over the residential area ofNorth Park, decimating blocks of homes and killing everyone within range. The information she received mistakenly placed the site of the accident several blocks northeast of where it had actually taken place, so that to her knowledge MT and their two children must be dead. It had taken everything they both had, to get her to that special Indian kismet just once; she knew it could never be done again. She knew the tests, for some reason especially in her case, were to be impossibly hard. In infinite resignation of a wholly broken heart, she resolved to stay and see her relation with the master out to whatever conclusion fate saw fit. It was practically midnight India-time before the transoceanic lines to North Park were intermittently clear for her to get through, for she never gave up trying- MT answered the phone, profoundly relieved to hear her, and told her of the single jolt that seemed to have lifted the whole house that morn- ing; only by the smoke over the rooftops was he alerted to the unprecedented disaster that had taken place a few blocks away. AAA's initiation through the Indian Master (and several other equally-powerful in- itiatory events while there) served to secure the total, transdimensional Linkage in and through the physical sphere4 of this in retrospect, of course; her conscious presence in India was due solely to her love of and respect for the salvatory Being of the master as the rare Gift to the physi- cal world it was ... and relatedly, to her valuation of that Gift as the only means of awakening any corresponding grace within herself by which others might be benefited through her. 632"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV All this was in '78; AAA returned, manifestly Transformed and their lives proceeded outwardly almost as if they functioned on a \"regular basis\" ... until December 19, '79 when the Spiritual Process in its fullness was suddenly Begun in her, and like a nuclear reaction that can't be stopped, their world came to a quick end.

All their work prior to this had, in retrospect, been a task of forging-- conjunction with the Inner Plane Master4 means of \"climbing up\", i.e. of moving metaphorically up the rungs of the Tree of Life, aspiring upward toward the Divine Domain along the axis of the \"chakra\" centers; since the return from India there had been established a peculiar placidity, a particular Calm, almost as if there was nothing else to \"do\", nothing else that could be done. They had both worked for the Real with uncommon effort, dauntless resolve, the facing of financial and personal hardship of an often soul-grinding character for nearly a decade--if one added the amount of time they'd separately aspired Sunward before they'd met, they could easily be thought to have put in a collective twentyfive. Now, it was as if everything that could be done by \"personal effort\", everything in this or any other world, had been done. A peculiar though not unpleasant \"stillness\" settled over their lives--by hindsight wisdom, the proverbial calm before the ultimate Storm. When the initiatory Process came, it came like a Lightningbolt. It blew up everything in its path. Just at the point they tacitly presumed there was nothing left, nothing but the peaceful living of their lives and adequate tending of their children's needs like anyone else who might ever have lived on ear& the Process irreversibly Visited them. AAA was struck squarely in the Heart The right Side of her opened up like a flickering candle. Radiance Wed the world; then the flame went fully out--the reign of the Queen of Infinite Night. No One Here Gets Out Alive The fmt Half of their prolonged mutual practice had all been upward aspiration, a reaching for the Light. This concluding Half of their Whole Spiritual Ordeal was what occurred, under optimum circumstances, when the seeker could reach no longer, had nowhere to reach, could see no \"higher zone\" to stretch toward, had exhausted the possibilities of stretching in any plane, state or imaginable dimension. In this great Second Half of the divine game there's nothing left but for the Divine Itself, whole and entire, to descend. There's nothing left but for Spiritual Absolute- value to come meet Its adorer at that halfway mark achieved under \"his own\" momentum, but beyond which he couldn't so much as even conceive a movement. Thus the Divine Half \"comes down\", flows forward right into the overt physical domain of the seeker's heretofore separate existence in the hermitage of \"ordinary vital life\", peremptorily pushing the last conceit of normalcy straight over the Rim without a single thing in all creation able to offer resistance. Indeed this is the \"crossing of the Abyss\"; for all the reading knowledge of such a legendary spiritual crisis it may now be recognized that in fact no seeker, no manifestation of the human polarity-of-things ever crosses that Abyss by personal effort. There is never any climbing of the \"indomitable aspirant\" up over the lip of that impossible Precipice, for there is no way to do so. That spiritual chasm is inconceivable. The seeker stands, an inch from its fatal abysm, and never knows he's there! Under such unchangeable circumstance, it's wholly the obligation of Spiritual- Absolute Itself to come down, to \"cross over\" that uncrossable chasm so as to claim the sacred"},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Heart of the seeker at last. Do you know now? Do you begin to understand what happened, what happened to AAA and MT that fine unexpected Day of the first Visitation of the Process? The Process is not \"a\" spirit; the Process is not a channeled Entity, an energy-intrusion from a UFO, or even an ultimate \"overshadowing\" by a Great Personality of the Spiritual Hierarchy. (Such \"overshadowing\" of AAA's normal physically-focused personality was in fact a passing phase of the Process, not a permanent object or conclusive result of the Process; thus, standard theosophical teachings display the obvious point at which its own adepts originally \"got off the boatw-when one thinks of it, what type of \"ultimate spiritual realization\" could it possibly be, to have one's personality replaced by the Spirit of Another?). No, the Process is the ''unmanned\" Vehicle of the Divine Half, without entified mediation. No \"person\" is there, and no Person either. It is incredibly Hot. Its Presence drives the unprepared and presumptuous mad; it makes Music in the livingroom for anyone to hear, it makes a Heavenly Bridal of the bedroom and in general cracks the walls with audible report from its irrepressible Pressure. It took away their car, (for they'd be in no real condition to \"drive\" for another half-decade); It summarily took away close fiiends and anyone else who might possibly have been of help during those thorough-grinding times (a few fled in utter incomprehension and fi-ank fear of what was going on, but others more steadfast who would surely have stuck through to the End were taken unceremoniously in an improbable twinkhg by death). It left them alone with two children (at the time, ages 4 and 7), alone in a small upstairs apartment, unable most of the time to move because of the paralytic tetany of the full magnitude of the Force come to claim them, alone in record-breaking La Mesa swelter with requirements of rent and electricity and food like everyone else but no good way to explain to anyone why they couldn't make it out the door! alone to bake to a quiet cinder in an upstairs he@-trap without fan or air conditioning, and an internal fire of incalculable magnitude kindled in calamitous rejoinder! (To this day, students sometimes still have dreams of two little pyramids of ash, two companion cones of dust that they know in the context of the dream to be none other than &L4 and MT). So it was that AAA and MT did not sunrive. The Sharing Of Community Impropriety During the three years in which they died to these impossible conditions (for the sake of netting, in the end, only what remained when the matters of \"living\" were subtracted from Life), there was intermittent effort to elicit the attention of certain \"spiritual communities\" (ostensibly set up to help and house such a Process out of an original, initiated recognition of just what a Brahma the real spiritual Process could breed). However the palpable cliquishness, insularity, absorptive self-concern and parochial fixation on those contingent details of the particular Spiritual Founder's \"own\" Realization (taken as rigid writ) manifestly disinclined any such community practitioners from listening to anything they considered \"outside\"--outside being defined by how many dues had been paid, how many subscriptions bought--and the whole desperate effort had ultimately to be consigned to the Flames as well. Thus, precisely those who were in a position to help and who should have known better, were fatally reluctant to extend themselves either in imagination, intelligence, empathy or heart; a whole book had to be closed on the usefulness and advisability of perpetuating the modernly magnified form of the \"extended spiritual community\"."},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV AAA And MT Go Hollywood After three remorseless years' Transformation (and remarkable last-minute \"saves\" by various ad hoc sources from eviction, electrical cutoff etc.) AAA and MT stuck their heads out of the apartment, blinked like moles, and set off for Los Angeles-where the first minute in town they were greeted by a SWAT team straight across the street hm the Bodhi Tree, they and their children being motioned to the ground while a phalanx of rifles right over their heads investigated ...an anonymous call, empty of significance but strangely focused upon the very house in front of which their fiiend had parked them. Welcome to L.A. It was as if the World, fiom which they'd been sealed those three and a half years within the perimeters of the apartment, instinctively struck toward the vicinity of their sudden presence, alarmed out of reason at the sense of some New and unfamiliar Being yet embarrassingly perplexed when face-to-face with their harmless \"ordinariness\" as was the S WAT-team captain who eventu- ally approached and sheepishly asked whether it was they who'd called in the report bringing his division there!

Why You Needn't Buy The Father's Line What then is the Teaching? what then has been brought to bear, in the upshot, for the benefit of All? Is the Mother-current the same as the \"Sakti\", another way of characterizing or causing to rouse the nether-fires of the kundalini? Is it Tummo, Tao or Teh, the spirit-flicker of the Cormorants? The Mother-current is not the same as or equivalent to the Sakti. The Mother-current involves the same elements known under the categorical specialties as kundalini, sakti, dakini-spirit, etc.-for all those terms refer to a basic nature-current patterning processes of the mindhody being (which is, necessarily, figured into any work of transformation, repolarization, awakening, spiritual renewal or regeneration etc.). Yet the Mother-current involves a totally dzyerent relation to those elements and those processes than is formulated in doctrine of the perennial practices accepting such systems as Keys of a particular type. To the age-old descriptions accepted uncritically by modem heirs, the awakening of \"kundalini\" and its reverse unfolding through the progressively-ampliLEed network of chakras and ganglia along the spinal axis is equal to consciousness, the direct realization of Spirit--the aim and final object of all sacred aspiration. The \"Mother\" then is understood as a custodian principle of that Spirit, the special force apprehended in the compound form of consciousness-energy. But the kundalini is a mtzu-e-current. It is not strictly the encoiled value of consciousness itself. We may understand this point if we consult the description given at the beginning of this"},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV essay; the recitation of the perennial patriarchal version of the \"feminine\" and its significance to the pattemsf-being was-as noted--rendered with special attention to terms so as to do adequate justice to the collective vision of the Patriarchate while circumventing the snares and general symbolic quicksand necessarily involved in any orthodox exposition (taking all key premises uncritically as holy writ). Noting our original delineation we see that the collective, traditional description infers the involvement of absolute Spirit-consciousness in the patterning processes of creative impulse- but it doesn't demand assumption of a one-to-one equation, fiom the outset. Indeed the traditions are fastidious in rendering their primary, cosmogonic or world-creating descriptions in distinct terms, clearly distinguishing the Whole-value of Absolute Spirit-being-assigned the \"masculine\" gender-fiom Its power or Sakti, the \"feminine\" creative impulse of limitation, conditional existence and perspectival focus (borrowing against that unitive Whole-value thus drawing It by artifice into provisional-4.e. \"as if '--one-to-one equations of identity). The creative power slyly \"mixes in\" that Whole-value as it churns the milk of manifes- tation, giving provisional life to its fonns through subliminal investment of the Self-same Spirit of Absolute Identity in mutually-dependent, compound integrities fixed through delimiting perspec- tive. There is then, if anything, an initial confusion of identities rather than defining dicta of \"one-to-one equivalency\" between Absolute-value, the basis and goal of the spiritual traditions, and the creative Maze of Manifestation through which that value is effectively sought. When, however, we flip over to the other side of the process in order to see what the traditions have to say regarding the recovery of that basic Spirit-identity, it becomes apparent they have along the way bought into that very confusion of identities (which othemise seems only to be characterized, not deified, in the cosmogonic descriptions themselves); for, when we ask after an adequate image of the liberative \"reversal\" of that Spirit-capturing process, we're told a return of the creative-current upward along the Path of its original descent is equivalent to the recovery of Consciousness! as if by following the kundalini-sakti along its daedalian reversion we'll simply merge in unbroken transition right back into Spirit the way Bundy turns into Centinela. There's suddenly no concession to the obvious fact that a confusion of values, not a linear interchange of values, accounted for the initial \"fall\" into the anfractuous Map of Manifestation to begin with. A contributing factor in this confusion of parallel magnitudes (Consciousness and the creative-vitality of Nature energy) with sequent magnitudes, may be found in the linear typology of the Patriarchate. The Line Forms On The Left Understanding something of how that typology initially comes about can serve to clarify much in the way of contemporary psychological orientation, the character of our influential symbols as well as the motivating key behind the collective religious and coupled esoteric practices of the world. We may observe the relevant Moment when Line emerges fiom the background and is raised to singular status, in conjunction with a decisive shift to \"left-brain\" emphasis and its verbal-linear, abstractlanalytic functions typifying the patriarchal order. In casting back to the critical juncture where the \"line forms to the left\", we see the curvilinear graph of agrarian cycles and soft, seasonal fluxes (calendrically mapping the matriarchal psyche) straighten out in the intercourse between Eras to the rectilinear boundary of demarcation"},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV distinguishing the centralist reference of the city-state, enclosing the symbolic kingship at its radially-convergent axis. This apotheosis of the line as a distinct separation-boundary between inward and outward, above and below, axial order and exterior chaos converts the natural system of coinhering complementaries to the artificial rigidity of polar dichotomization. What's virtually unknown to the historiographer tracing the changes of surface appear- ance, is that shifts in the structure of culture enact psychic interpretations of the total meaning, purpose, character and intent of Being, the spiritual basis for existence. This spiritual basis of every order no matter how apparently \"~ecular'~ (by modem standards of strict separation) is the distilled Idea presiding over its pattem, from which all ancillary and interrelated concepts depend. This fact should become only more apparent when we look back at the early eras, especially those making the transition from matriarchal prehistory to the \"histo- ricity\" of the patriarchate; for at this stage there is no presumed separation between sacred and mundane culture. An economic fact is here still a spiritual fact, a means of expressing the exchanges and equivalencies of basic value reflecting the very numen of sun and moon, stars and sky. Here it should be eminently apparent that cultural developments are stimulated by changes in the sacred (ideofonn) fi-ame of reference. The central role of priest, shaman, pythoness or psychopomp as Giver and Keeper of the forms of order in such traditional or tribal frameworks, ought to be powerfully suggestive even if we can't make immediate analogy with the more \"murky\" or masked origins of social numen in our secularized hework of fluid capital and abstract wealth etc. Fixing on this flow of Influence, however, we can understand the shift from the Circle of the matriarchate to the Line of the patriarchate with across-the-board economy of interpretation. We can clearly see that the operative typology of Line as a noetic principle, a symbolic standard and psychic integrator emerges in accompaniment of \"sacred\" practices involving axiaYone- pointed focus on the \"inward\" side of the mindlbody form (as exteriorly expressed through biorhythmic nature-patterns) and in the skyward direction of the cortical \"heaven-father\". Eye Of The High God This system in the sacred order of the faculties effectually displaces the locus of cultural and psychic \"gravitation\" from the navel of the earth-womb, the chthonic vital-Mother. Such shamanic or late-aboriginal practices serve as specific spiritual technology to disclose (for the Sacred or \"secret\", Unitive Eye) the subtending Geometries and ontological coordinates through which the very, defining tensions of nature's polyfom patterns are aligned. Indeed a formal truth of the organizational currents is disclosed, in the implemental shift to such sacred arrangement of the faculties and sense-functions. Emergent knowledge of the noetic key to nature's capricious profusion (in the form of richly detailed yet symmetrically abstract, kaleidoscopic patterns producing the ratios and integral equations of ordered variability in the processes of change) imparts the power of a numbermagic enlisting subtle rhythms of the elements--an ensorcelling geometry, whereby to draw the potential chaos of nature's creative uprush to a regularity of abstract resolution. When applied as an interior standard (its original, Sacred form) defining the psychic continuity of nature's mosaic profhion, such Geometrizing comprises an appropriate science of magical types potent to work with the essential grain of nature's flow; when applied as an exterior standard of measurement the critique of Euclidean \"abstraction\" is ultimately justified in that it"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV serves as Procrustean means of slicing nature's lovely, irregular curvature through the plane of a rectilinear enforcement as we find in the case of modem-day science and technology.

The bejewelled coherence of nature's profusion is not then originally understood on the basis of an exterior, proximal model to which no factual turbulence of the elements conforms; it is founded on a special configuration of the faculties and sense coordinates, the sacred or shamanic Spirit-vision through the \"shew-stone\" of which the psychic unity of the manifest patterns is displayed.

Through The Time-Tunnel Emphasis on the \"exclusive\" faculty of left-brain organization, induces an exclusive emphasis. The effect is that of modeling a Psychic order placing an exaggerated division-bomaby between the nuclear ego-being and the field of patterning processes through which it arises, and of which it's expression. This is accomplished altogether through the left-brain value of negation, uniformly underlying its conceptual and analytic architecture; with the general use of the Negating principle, it becomes possible to interpolate the sense of an apparent \"distancing\" or self-cancelling removal. This, in turn, has the effect of subdividing the sensible continuum of the gestalt (right- brain) present, polarizing it in extremis through the inexistent tenses of \"past\" and \"future\" and so distributing the integral immediacy of the whole being across a Temporal Zone fitted with directional arrows of strictly lineafom value, overseeing a one-way flow toward the (perpetually postponed) resolution of the future's dim horizon-line. The general structure of this Psychic \"formula\", assumes the distinctly phallic orienta- tion of a linear extension toward ultimate \"climax\" or denouement; it becomes translated into every form of expression, assembling the general psychology of \"vanishing-point perspective\", blindered fiontal fixation along a narrowly-focused hework of effective L'tunnel vision\", strict goal orientation, surplus-savings and linear accumulation (postponement of present-orgastic gratifica- tion) etc.; it dominates the spiritual interpretation of life in the form of temporalized covenants, arcing-rainbow promises of Messianic returns at Time's ultimate Terminus or W, worlds-end deliverance fiom the suffering of sequent \"recursion\". And it takes the foxm of the linear unfolding, the sequential uprush of the Sakti along the rigid-inflexible structure of a fixed, \"phallic\" axis, to ultimate orgasmic discharge or defitive denouement in return to Spiritual Source, the Upper-ceiling Eminence of Awakened Godhead. The Kundalini Is A Nature-Current The problem with this logically imposed analogue, is that the kundalini-saki is a nature current. All the multidiiensional potential of its interlocking codes defines the axial \"bodies\" and variable fhmeworks through which the value of the conscious axis may align in modeling its provisional terms of Identity. The Sakti as nature-current furnishes a potential \"space\", a veritable hypothesis of coordinate orientation any given arrangement of which provides the whole-value of consciousness a more-or-less great opportunity to mask or to disclose to itself the real magnitude of Being. No such \"environment\" provided by the variable, coordinate grid-network of the nature current may be considered a one-to-one equivalent of Consciousness in itself, i.e. the Whole Value of Absolute Spirit-Being. On the contrary, any such potential framework (i-e. as our present perceptual grid-pattern of the \"physical\" Mework of focus) defines the field of identification through its particular, polar extremes, in which the Whole-value of Conscious Identity may be provisionally invested. According to the specific ingenuity of its grid-aligned Artifice it may cham"},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the Spirit of Whole-conscious value to full, experimental Identiq-investment for a season; or it may disabuse Consciousness through that self-same spell, persuading it finally to forsake such identity equations as congenitally deficient and painzy restrictive with respect to its incommensurable Whole-value in Itself. But in any case there is no certified linear progress, no sequential rnarchj-om the restrictive and befooling plane of perceptual \"masks\" or displacing anisomerisms (halving identity through mirroring interferences) to the Hall of inescapable Self-revelation. The model of kundalini yoga has, through its conditioning of the operative pattem of the nature-current, standardized a picture of spiritual liberation in which the coiled nucleus of kundalini at the spinal base is \"triggered\" to unfold and flow upward, in sequent restoration of the energies and facultative forms it had subtracted fiom the centers or dimensional planes of its downward, focal lockin. Thus the kundalini-nucleus, in the form of liberated Sakti-energy with its corresponding \"chakra\" codes, is said to uncoil like a snake and progressively extend up the spinal axis, \"lighting the wicks\" so to speak of the hierarchic centers in turn with its kindled flame or flowering \"serpent-fire\". Each center, so ignited by the \"restored\" energy-value, returns its quality to the axis of Consciousness and so becomes a mode of illumined awareness. According to the patriarchal map of kunddini yoga (referred to in its broadest sense so as to include parallel theories of Sufism and Qabalism etc.), there's a necessary sequence in the unfolding of knowledge or direct perception with respect to the various centers. First the field of perception must be flooded with praetematural light of the subtldetheric energies composing the kundalini coil or autonomic nature-current in itself; then this physical focal-framework must naturally yield to the psychic or symbolically surcharged energy patterns of the Astral field to which attention is delivered as through an enabling portal by hydraulic pressure of the etheric-current, on the crest of which awareness rides (the etheric current of kundalini actually constituting, in its rotational webworks and moue patterns through the chakra sites, the threshold \"mainframes\" of those extradimensional Doorways). Eventually the etheric-ingress to the cosmic field of Mind or the creative patterns of Heaven Worlds is said to \"open\" in correlation with the value of the Third Eye center according to the sequential yogic doctrine; and finally, awareness is borne upon the Self-illumining Cloud of the Conscious Heaven of Heavens, fieed through final Exit of the Sahasrar. Some such pattem or linear variation is characteristic of the inherited traditions of the patriarchate. The T&-A-TG~~ Of Identity And The Teh What we find, first of all (through contrastive Illumination of the standard furnished by the Awakened Mother-current) is that excited perceptions and superadded energies released according to the convention of lineadsequential unfolding are expressions of the heretofore invisible patterning of the vitalfield. Adding these perceptions to the axis of awareness may seem to obey the \"necessary\" progression of a logical evolution; but the compressed evolutionary potential of the kundalini-coil with its chakra-values of extranormal faculties, psychic functions and fields is not equatable in strict linear fashion, or through any \"table of correspondences\", with degrees of Consciousness. The nature-energy of kundalini, left to uncoil \"sequentially\", is not obedient to any standard of consciousness but only to an automatic-prerecorded energy code or timed sequence of nature processes. Rather than progressively conform to the standard of Consciousness (or Whole-"},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV being value) in its linear unfolding, it obeys the logic of interwoven energy-vehicles in their respective, contributing \"layers\" of psychic value; it leads the habituated focus of (physically-ori- ented) consciousness up through atmospheres of energy process, where that focus may be exposed to grades of organizational phase-space coding variobs-psychic-values imparted from Its own axis. Yet since Consciousness corresponds to a value of Identity through that central axis effectively invested in various habituated patterns of the nature-current, its commitment is to the prevailing or operative code of that identity. It bears no one-to-one equivalence of identity with the nature-current simply \"unlocked\" and obeying the internally-patterned logic of its own, evolutionary program. The kundalini is released and wanders one way, carrying the effective focal-coordinate network of awareness with it; but the allegiance of consciousness to its fixated identity-patterns is such that it is not obligated (by the sudden departure of kundalini hm its fixed fkme of reference) to find itself \"in spirit\" exactly equal to or even with that energy's \"next move\". On the contrary, kundalini is the essentially responsive force, patterning the codes of intent or conscious will and magnifying their ideoform implications through all fields of its prolific self-multiplying nature activity. Consciousness, in its form as the sliding be of focal reference associated with the moving sakti-cmt, may then \"ghde into place\" through a network of energy coordinates aligned with a variantly-polarized experiential field, charged with new visions, values, typologies and guidelines of workable orientation. But consciousness isn't obliged by the innate logic of such a field in itself. Consciousness is still equated with its identity-investments. Consciousness has been \"led along\" by automatic unfolding of the sequent ''evolutionary\" code of the nature-energy, but only in the form of the Horse that can be led to water yet never forced to drink. Indeed, being a responsive energy deductively obedient to the code of conscious intenf the Saki will ultimately shape the given field in conformance to the habituated identity-investments of the ordinary ego consciousness. Ultimately, it will \"follow the lead\" of limited ideas fiom the standard fkme of reference, the regular pattern of identity-investment; it will arnplifL and magically magnrfi the very terms of ordinary ego-expectation in the intensified milieu of the \"advanced\" psychic environment, so that consciousness will seem to be all-the-more powerfully and undissuad- ably confirmed in its ordinary, imbalanced systems of beliefs and delimited knowledge. Sakti Follows The Lead Of A Consciousness Entranced By Her Form In this lineaform model of spiritual evolution (standardized in programmed energy-cur- rents hm the viewpoint of \"patriarchal wisdom\"), the kundalini-saki automatically unfolds itself, sequentially extended according to the internal logic of its nested faculties and filtrate, perceptual patterns. It unfolds without reference to Whole-Conscious value; in this model, the Awakened magnitude of Whole-Conscious-value doesn 't guide and inform it like a vine trained unerringly to grow toward the Sun along a straight-and-narrow trellis. Nonetheless, being a responsive nature-energy formulating its processes through unitive typologies of psychic intent or will, the sakti necessarily has to conform whatever fields with which it's presently aligned into obedient reflection of the given-functional-+tatus characterizing conscious identity patterns. Sakti configures even the higher fields with which its \"evolutionary\" processes are aligned, in conformance with the prevailing level of conscious identity; so that"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"presently, the patterns of the nature-current pull \"off track\" of its evolutionary program, and end in some cul-de-sac or quicksand swamp driven there by the internal logic of the operative ideas in the upper limit of identity-investment. This accounts for the phenomenon, experienced with familiar frequency by practitioners of the traditional model (kundalini-yoga etc.) of the apparently \"ascending\" force becoming mysteriously diverted, either falling like mercury in a thermometer to normal level after being promisingly heated, or flying off at a horizontal tangent, deserting the \"vertical\" trajectory and simply fashioning its magnetic lines of action according to the low-level plane of intent across which it's deflected, merely imparting uncommon effectiveness to conventional drives and desires--in- deed dezfying them through the stronger available atmospheres of spiritual potential with which it's directly aligned. Why Psi? She Sighed It becomes evident after a while (an historical \"while\", anyway) that the addition or restoration of supernormal \"faculties\" in a strict evolutionary line is neither the means of or equivalent to, the achievement of the life's purpose in the form of Awakened Whole-being. Those faculties and fields were originally coded, if we remember our downflowing description of the world-generating process, as variegated expression of Whole-Conscious-value, aligned and organ- ized with reference to the standard of Spirit. What is the real significance of such \"psi\" faculties or \"extraordinary\" ki-powers in themselves? They're obviously only \"extraordinary\" as modes of connection and direct integration demonstrating \"above\" the stylized limit of the deeply reductive focus ofphysical manifestation. As modes offunctioning they obviously only have meaning in the first place with reference to those extreme, masking limits. (What does it mean to be able to fly in an instant between one mountain-top and another, except with reference to the most restrictive limitations of a \"bio-mechanical\" being confined to the results of muscle-exertion and the \"sweat of one's brow\"!). They do not conduce to Conscious Whole-value; they merely expand the manifestable potential of Being permitted through the Infinite Void-term of Conscious Whole-value. None of these potentials is, in itself--and no matter at what \"evolutionary\" level it's bctioning-indispensable to the Awakening of Conscious Whole-value. It is only true there's a minimum, configurational alignment and stably balanced integration of current-patterns through the extent of the multidimensional axis that's necessary as permissive ground for the awakened continuity of Awareness, or Conscious Whole-value; yet the perennial misperception of the character and non-linearproperty of those current patterns even through \"Line\" of the Conscious Axis, has prevented the relieving recognition that such processes may integrate according to a variable ratio of alignment amongst the centers and energy-currents. Realigning The Line The centers and currents don 't really operate as a linear scale of potencies aroused \"in turn\", giving a recitation of facultative credentials at each respective level before proceeding a notch . . --upward\". Rather, the autonomic energy currents (which normally keep the Conscious axis deflected \"offside\" through the vital-web of their processes, patterning a compound focal lockin of fixed perceptual distortion in imbalanced ratios of alignment through both \"horizontal\" and"},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"MATRIX N \"vertical\" axes) may undergo repolarization and functional realignment with respect to the integra- tive Common Denominator of the cerebrospinal channel. Such a realignment, distributing the mul- tidimensional ratios of current-interaction accord- * ing to a threshold harmony of integral adjustment, achieves a permissive self-congruence of the Con- scious Axis so that* effectdts Whole-value Internal External becomes available as the overt organizational Balancing Balancing Term of all possible planes or variable states of manifestation! There is no special significance that adheres to one possible plane or level of perception; there is no \"indispensable\" field of focus in the compound triangulations of the processing nature-currents. Even the physical field of focus, the plane of ordinary perceptions, becomes theoretically fit to serve as the sufficient occasion or incidental \"place\" in the Self-knowing of Consciousness, the iiberative Awareness of Spirit-Being! The \"secret\" is simply this: the requisite, threshold \"symmetries\" or balanced organi- zations ofthe energy-currents through the vertical distribution of centers, may be achieved according to systems of external alignment amongst the centers, or internal alignment within each center! The rotation of energy-tumblers through patterned \"locks\" of the centers is less frequently associated with the internal readjustment of any given center. Such readjustment establishes a variant alignment of the current-potentials characteristic of the given center, so for example a latent or recessed power of that center is drawn forward and made to \"flower\". Iffor instance the particular, adjustive practice was to realign internal patterns of a lower or \"vital\" center (sequentz.aIly one of the first unfolded by the upflowing sakti), some \"supemormal\" power associated with that center would be potentiated, and available to \"demonstration\". Such are the ki powers sometimes demonstrated in the martial arts, resulting fiom characteristic concentration in the tan-tien or vital-abdominal powex center. These internal alignments and potentiating, rotational symmetries are less fkquent because the various powers they release would, on a collective scale, serve to reorganize the whole potential of thephysicalfield; heretofore this was spiritually verboten since the physical plane had to be kept in a state of 3rddensity \"masking\" as a stably reliable School of a certain type. While such restriction is somewhat lessened in this time of millennial transit to 4th density, it must still be generally adhered to, as the \"lessons\" of this focal plane still largely involve the coded restrictions we know as the \"way things are\". It is, then, the external alignment and symmetric adjustment between and amongst the centers that comprises the minimum and acceptable circumstance of Conscious Self-congruence. It does not require or involve any \"sequential unfolding\" of purely evolutionary stages. It requires the harmonious alignment of vital, psychic, mental and spiritual centers with the Axis of conscious- ness. In this way the vital-psychic dimensions of energy and subtle force may still be functionally recessed, locked within the holding-pattern of their particular center; and yet the \"ordinary\", fixed Mework of physical focus may sene as sufficient basis for the direct realization of Whole-Con- scious value."},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Have you ever considered why, under ordinary circumstances, your framework of attention or threshold of awareness is unconsciously restricted to the standard, two-degree field of focus? Have you ever considered why, on top of this, you're seldom if ever directly aware of any \"direction\" or dimension of your Being other thai \"straight ahead\", in linear canaiization of consciousness? why you're never immediately and simultaneously aware of the dimensions \"above\" and \"below\", \"to the sides\" and \"behind\" etc.? Has it ever occurred to you that the Whole-value of Conscious Identity is not contrac~udly committed to or permanently equated with such a narrow, restrictive field of focus as conventionally characterizes the available magnitude of awareness? What keeps \"you\" attached to these mechanical boundaries of focus? What reduces down and seems to diminish the Whole-value of absolute Spirit-consciousness, to the dimensions of sequential object-content? to identified equation with the linear association of thoughts? The real function of the energy-current, the developmental nature-pattern, is that of aligning in conformal adjustment and harmonious congruence with the Conscious axis. It is meant to be led, organized, ordered and integrated through the directly governing value of that axis. The \"kundalini\" is not meant to be worshipped and adored as an independent agency, for on its own, \"out of sight\" of the direct down-beaming of Spirit Consciousness, it grows only capriciously--and it grows inevitably awry, guided (in its \"evolutionary\" unfolding) to employ the potentiated forms of its coded current in conformance to the oblique perspective of ego-intent. Consciousness is not meant to be locked into enchanted adherence to its ostensibly \"phallic\" structure, but rather, its structure is meant to be globally organized and aligned with reference to the Whole-value of Consciousness. Notice that standard kundalini-practice necessitates worship of the Sakti-current, con- tinuous adoration of it in order to effectually integrate awareness in lockstep adjustment and adaptation right \"behind\" it. This \"method\" merely helps to maintain the illusion of its strict, phallic sequence of \"linear\" unfolding, as it artificially encloses the force of identity in fascinated correspondence with the flow of facultative \"jewels\" continuously drawn out of itself. Consciousness, Like Sir Walter Raleigh, Should Always Prepare Her Path The ground directly ahead of the unfolding kundalini (whether that unfolding is conceived in linear terms or terms of \"chordal harmonics\" etc.) should always be prepared in advance by the effective presence of a Consciousness awakened to--at leasb-an anticipatory degree. Despite the linear persuasiveness of the conventional picture, this is not akin to \"putting the cart before the horse\"; the guiding measure of the nature-current's work in or through any dimension, whether it will incline its \"head\" to left, to right or in alignment with Center, is the Intent that suffuses it from the \"programming\" angle of the operative identity-pattern determining inclination of the Conscious Axis. The minimal basis for the quickening of direct Whole-being Awareness, can be estab- lished as a chordal harmonic across the length of that axis before any particular subsequence of \"notes\" runs the Sakti through a linear drill of her scales (this important principle will be presently explained); in such case the program of \"progressive\" notes will be a sure expression of the governing Chord, completely in harmony and always with reverential reference for the Conscious Key in which its resonance is \"written\". 644"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV It is equally possible that the pattern of conscious identity, while not itself directly illuminated so as to \"personally\" stand at the Summit of the Sakti's next rise in flawless guidance of that force, may nonetheless align itself by Intent with a Value of Consciousness which is thus directly illumined. It thereby turns the Guidance of ik own energy-systems @y Intent, by the sheer resolution of will), over to the gyroscopic Measure of an Awakened hework that can serve as effective Reference for the orientation of realigning currents. In either case, the value of Whole-Conscious being serves as Standard and Resolving denominator of the polarized fluxes in the oncoming, undulant Serpent-force. It \"anticipates\" the advancing action of the Sakti, and so in effect prepares the Ground for its most efficient \"fillingg\" of the available Space. This model of the manner in which the processes of the mind/body axis ought to work according to the Awakened principle of the Mother-current, stands in glaring contrast to the inbuilt \"methodology\" of traditional yogic or \"kundalini\" practice established through its own structuring premise. Fohat As Leaf-blower Of The Cosmic Tree The phenomenon of the automatic \"bellows-breathing\" or spontaneous krja of the respiratory system as may be witnessed to this day in the context of kundalini-practice (in which the Sakti-current seems to \"take it upon\" itself to perform the postures, the exercises, all the dynamics of yogic culture as a gratis appropriation of the voluntary cords by the involuntary axis) is commonly considered to exemplify a virtue of such meditative regimes4.e. that the strenuous and ordinarily willdependent processes presumed to establish the appropriate, purified mind-body culture (coincident with the habitation and extension of Sakti) are obligingly performed for you-thus apparently demonstrating that the most efficient and effective yoga of Transfomation is the one which literally commandeers the volitional systems on the practitioner's behalf and minimizes what the personality need do for itself. Such a characteristic phenomenon of the kundalini-methodology, while impressively extraordinary to conventional dogmas re the strict division of voluntary/involun~ systems, does not prove its superior merit simply in virtue of its exceptional phenomenology. That phenomenology is caused in the first place by a deficiency in the whole hework of the practice, having practical consequences. The Sakti \"takes it upon itself' to automatize the \"voluntaristic\" dimensions of pranayama or breath-practice etc., owing to the fact that in its mechanically-sequential evolvement it continuously runs ahead of precisely that Consciousness which ought to be its fore!runner, so that it has to compensate the \"uninhabitable\" quality of the next-dimension-up in its onward advance by plying the biophysical culture itself, pushing--through its hydraulic pressure-upon the appro- priate \"pumps\" of the system in order to flush out the lees and dregs preventing the next-more-in- tegral configuration of the circulatory and respiratory plexuses etc. What it b'prepares\" by this automatic work, however, is simply a potential place for consciousness to reside. The identity-patterns of consciousness have done virtually nothing to conform to this broadened Space voluntaristically, and so the governing force of actual identity-in- vestment bears little functional or practical correspondence to the provisionally-potentiated \"envi- ronment\" of the (interiorly-flushed) physiology."},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Fohat As Sisyphus This lack of basic correspondence due to that very subtraction of the voluntaristic or willed factor as \"unnecessary\", accounts for anothkr characteristic phenomenon of such practice, i.e. the cyclic collapse of the Sakti-force back into conformal alignment with a technically lower stage of development and systemic integration, to which thefirnctional inclination of Identity drags it. The traditional typology of the linear or sequential \"Sakti\" practices, then, is much like that of the mythical typology of Sisyphus. Even where such practices are apparently successful in the \"ultimate\" sense, they've only succeeded in formulating a spurious (and equally collapsible) equivalency between the interlocked force of Identity and the Spacious environment of the nature-current, weaving a heavenly enchantment of reflective parallelisms. In fact, even the Sakti of conventional kundalini-practice does not \"unfold sequentially upward\" except by artificial modeling. It may be stimulated from its core by compressive breathing-practices, or triggered by energy-transmission of \"guru-kripa\" through the head or heart-centers; but in any case, once the minimum alignment and harmonious integration of the autonomic/subconscious currents balances the enfolded energy-nucleus in parallel congruence with the conscious axis, Sakti nature-force activates the immediate polar correspondence between the lower, vital abdominal centers from which it issues, and the basal brain lobes. It reverses polarization immediately and activates the back of the head, only minimally \"touching\" the intervening chakras or centers. What's ReaZZy Said, While Mind Misquotes Its Favorite \"Linew Having energized the basic void juncture of the Alta-major or medullary center, it sparks the gap or void-space to the Third Eye .where--at least minimally-it activates informing Whole- value. men, secondarily, it issues progressive pulsatory magnitudes of liberated energy by measure along the established nature-cord of the central axis, delivering the largest \"doses\" of that energy to chakras corresponding to the characteristic interests, identifications and facultative emphases of the particular personality! There is already a charge on those centers making them proportionately \"magnetic\" fiom long cultivation and use, so that Sakti tends to gravitate to the loci of its strongest, reinforced memory-patterns. Thus the personality is meant to work its Spiritual Destiny fiom this Initiatorypoint, on the natural basis of those interests, faculties, talents and powers already cultivated and most characteristic, which become magnified by direct infusion of the Sakti and thenceforth serve, ideally, as powerful tools for the further adjustment of the mindlbody totality (with direct reference to the revealed Whole-value of Consciousness, effectually mediated at the Awakened Third Eye). From this we may understand that the \"sequential\" order oftraditional kundalini practice is an artificial instance in the actual, harmonic ratios governing variable adjustment and resonant integration of the centers along the Conscious axis. The collective, psychic pattern (the \"biomor- phic\" form of cumulative expectation characterizing its specific energy atmosphere) built up in relation to \"kundalini\" practice over time, produces a certain groove that becomes superimposed on the practitioner's personal energy-harmonics of systems and centers; the doctrinal orientation"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of the initiate/practitioner with respect to the guiding Symbol-value of the Line, reinforces the suggestive potency of the collective template or psychic \"Egregor\" of the kundalini-model. Thus the tendency is that of repetitively experiencing the linear \"unfolding\" of kunnalini, with the inevitable mistaken equations between its reordered bsychic \"atmospheres\"-or potentiated envi- ronments--produced through the coordinates of the nature-field, and the Wholeconscious value of Identity in Itself. Even here however, the concrete experience of kundalini-practitioners belies the abstract certainty of the patriarchal model, and gives suggestive reinforcement to the idea of the Salcti-current as a soft, yieldingly-elastic variability in the ratios and harmonics of the centers, operating a sliding keyboard of chordal resonances rather than a hard scale of altemating single notes. The feminine value of the nature-current, then, may be restored to its characteristically \"feminine\" order of actual functioning, without artificial imposition of the rigidly maleflinear model forcing the \"eternal female\" to behave in masculine disguise doing strong violence to the purposeful character of her operations. A Mediating Model From A Modified Male-Order In substantiation of this, we may note that Tibetan practices make pejorative reference to the Hiidu concept of \"kundalini\"; and while they may seem to be addressing the same nuclear energy in their practices of Tummo-yoga etc., the modus operandi is distinctly different though divulging a parallel pattern. The Tibetans imaginatively visualize the willed mergence of the natureelements through alternating breath-currents into the central channel, or spinal column. They imaginatively will the synthesized elements in conjunction with powem \"vase-breathing\", to kindle the secreted energy-nucleus at the perineum to a fine flame; this flame is imaginatively willed up the central channel where it's \"seen\" to warm and melt the Tigle, or consciousness-seed (\"bindu\" in Hinduism) at the Third Eye center. That seed then imaginatively drips down sequentially upon the chakras, giving rise in descending order to the Innate Born Blisses of the respective centers. The difference between this traditional Tibetan practice and that of Hindu yogism or hatha, kundalini etc., is significant. Though it still takes the value of the ignited force in sequence, it is reverse sequence. The process proceeds under direct jurisdiction of the Third Eye center, or functional locus of Conscious Void-value; the succeeding centers in descending order are aligned and opened with reference to that primary Standard. And the fact of the deliberate employment of willed imgimtion to construct a conscioudy stylized or ideofonn typology of the elements, centers and systems, shows clear preference for the regulatory guidance of the volitio~l axis, the Value of Conscious Whole-being Itself. Note that the volitional guidance system of controlled imagination traces the exact same pattern for the path of the nature-current or Tummo-fire we've just described. Its ascent effectually bypasses the hierarchy of (intermediate) centers; it goes directly to the Third Eye, then secondarily effects the opening of the intermediate zones. Note that, in the period of AAA's and MT's preparatory practice in doing primary experimentation with nature-currents and energy systems of the mind/body being, they didn't proceed fiom the oblique haphazard perspective of the nature-processes in themselves; their guidance always came primarily fiom counsel and Influence of the Inner Plane Master, and so fiom"},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the Spirit Axis of Whole-Conscious Value Itself. That has always been their guiding principle and Standard me of reference, from the beginning. Can we say, then, after all this, what the Mother-current in fact actually is? It is not the activated nature-current, the creative energies of manifestation in themselves; but rather it is those energies, properly corresponding to the primordial feminine value, awakened and informed in their renovative adjustment of the mindhody totality (and the analogical \"earth- sphere\" in its stage of millennial transition) by the Whole-value and Living Spirit of Consciousness Itself. The Mother-current is then necessarily the transformative energy of the dimensions focused in the physical body and earth sphere, with special reference to the birthing mechanism and secret spiritual function of the female mind/bo& structure, fully Awakened and in transformative Motion by Grace of the Absolute value of Divine Spirit-Consciousness. It is awakened Adeptship of the highest initiatory degree in the form of the Mother Herself, come to be with us in this Time.

It is the Power of Being given special, Awakened Focus through the feminine form to harmonically entrain and so transmute the mind/body vehicles of all who'd gracefully follow--and therefore reinforce--the millennial metamorphosis of the earth-sphere.

'901 Dear MT, (ContinuedjFom last month 's Letters to the Editor column) In your writings, you cover the crux of metaphysics very well, to the point where, should a question form in one's mind, lo and behold! (as you might say), the next paragraph takes up that very query. If, then, genius is measurable-and one way of measuring it surely lies in obserwing ideas manifest and their extravagant variations4en it seems you would qualify. That being so, I still have a question, on a subject touched upon in November's issue. You say: \"But what about all the evidence that our circumstances ... often ... correspond to ... our wants, aims and wishes ... Often things 'come to us' ...as if by magic ... \". Which is true- often--and which touches upon the age-old saying \"be carell what you want for you may get it\". You go on to asserf accurately, that some New Agers have made a selfish fetish out of \"get what you want\"; you then amplify in the pam, Why You Don 't Create Your Own Reality, which is quite a classic in abstract logic. Having read your writings with great care, still that \"correspond and print out\" reality-what one might in brevity term Visualize-Assert-Demonstrate-eems to require, for me, further attention. Granted, \"enlightenment\" would seem to bring all things, and perhaps things at variance with former ideas; however, should the \"wishes-can-be-made-to-form principle be true-and it seems to be true--then why would it work erratically? What I mean is, that the proving of such a principle only once in manifstation, surely proves it for all time, does it not? Why, then, the variation which we (presumably) all of us experience? Were you (meaning you yourself, Michael Topper), able to convert and convey to myself and others, exactly how such a principle can be demonstrated with consistent success, then surely we would be well on the way to an enlightened world by, as it were, reversal? Would not then the Law of Polarity (Hermetic: All opposites in nature are identical), indicate that the ability to produce materially might act upon the individual as an elevating spiritual force; as a wonder of wonders; as \"the light that never was on land or sea\"; as an accelerating superfusion in which enlightenment would be endowed as automatic process? Admittedly, the selfish might for a time choose to wreak havoc ending in their selfdestruction, but they do that anyway. Please, if you will, let me have your observations on these points. Sincerely, Dnunmond Riddell Los Angeles, CA The Great Motto-in-the-Lotto Caper Gather 'round now Drummond, and all you heavy-laden who would that \"you create your own reality\" were true: \"Everybody in; the ceremony's about to begin\". Let's find out right here, without fiuther delay, to what extent this \"New Age\" maxim may have some truth to it, and to what extent it must be modified so as to make whatever truth may be embedded in it more usably effective. 649"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Drummond's riddle refers of course to the essay \"Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality\", in the \"New Age Cheers and Jeers\" section of the Nov. '89 issue of the T-Bird. First of course, that essay should be read and reread as the case may be. It takes into account (and serves to explain) the publicly-popularized part of traditional ivisdorn which has always shown that there's a certain correspondence-of-identity between one's personal experience and the basic thoughts, feelings, beliefs and emotions held as one's own; yet it also shows that the chronic failure to profit in an absolute way from this \"magical\" effect of existence is a result of the implications which the ego would draw from it on the basis of its own terms, drives and desires. It shows that such a universal \"failure\", despite recognition of the psychic and energetic laws involved, is not a remediable result of some mechanical imperfection of \"technique\", some plugable gap of knowledge or educable deficiency in proper practice; it is the product of failing to understand the context in which the effect of the \"magical mirror\" takes place. It is due to the misperception involved in believing the effect is a datum in its own right, independently existing to be taken advantage of by any who stumble on the \"rules\" governing its operation. Our November '89 essay implied a general failure on the part of those espousing \"you create your own reality\", (whether incarnate or discarnate) to appreciate the fact that this experiential system of funhouse mirrors takes place not in its own right but as function of a Spiritual context, in which all such images and objective selfestimates are reflected against the whole-value Standard of Reality-+ value that is never self created but which, rather, furnishes the terms on a universal scale which can be \"personally\" adapted in modeled approximation of whole-being Resolution, from a partial or perspectival \"angle\". Measured against such a Totalizing standard, the necessary limit and congenital \"parti- ality\" of any viewpoint enfolded upon itself as the real (rather than simply the efficient) Referent becomes disclosed again and again in the very features of experience bearing the personality's signature; all the implications of ego-identity as represented in the characteristic thoughts, desires and drives are revolved on the ballroom crystal, beamed back from the objective theatre of experience as an ongoing exhibit of everything contained in the summary self-idea, the overt and hidden facets, the given expectations as well as unanticipated consequences and repercussions. Thus everytizing does tend to arise in experience with a curious resonance of \"correspondence\"; the field of \"neutral\" exteriority peopled with things and beings seemingly independent of us, is nonetheless a continuous cartoon for personal ideas, opinions and beliefs correlating a psychic lodestone of types. Obviously, then, as indicated in the Nov. essay, the object isn't the magical-mirror effect itself, the L'tailoring\" of experience to specification in the distractive domain of the Funhouse; the object is to learn from the Whole-implication reflected back frompartial perspectives and deleted Identity-investments so as to be awakened to the Context in which the entire thing takes place; the object is to quicken and align oneself not in accord with the conceptual estimates of chronic self-reference but according to the Whole-being value in which everything occurs (even as distorted, fragmental impressions of it!)--against the uncompromising Standard-of-which everything is ultimately reflected, weighed, measured and evaluated. This said, it is well known to Triple-A and MT that people remain quite fascinated with the first effect, and have scant patience for the lessons belonging.to the real Point of the whole project-or will they it seems, given that Mr. Riddell's request in the face of good general comprehension indicates the public tenor of things; at least, so his proposition goes, until such time"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV as \"I\", \"myself\", Michael Topper, were to \"convert and convey\" to Drummond bband others, exactly how such a principle can be demonstrated with consistent success\", in which case-so he avers-4e \"proving of such a principle only once in manifestation, surely proves it for all timdoes it not?\" Does it? Shall we see? Here's your proof, then; therefore here's your test, the test of your proposition that once shown, it is \"proved for all time\"--and by implication the sufficiency of the proof itself will then turn people toward that Truth which the existence of such proof compels. Yes, this absorptive fascination of people with the lint (magical-mirror) effect of reality has been long noted and well known to both AAA and MT, to the degree that even prior to the receipt of Drummond's letter they'd determined to Demonstrate, at the appropriate time, just that Principle so prized but misunderstood by people--demonstrate it in such a way as to be unmistakable to any who'd but look, demonstrate it on a very overt public scale so the Roof of it would be visibly available to all, right under everyone 's nose, an integral part of their everyday life and yet-outra- geously, preposterously, with many double-takes and blinks of the incredulous eye, beaming up at them as a quite personalized Hello, a happy salutation fiom A&l and MT as if neutral everyday objects of the world could suddenly speak. Upon receiving Drummond's letter of course, the appropriate occasion was inaugurated, the premise of the great Ritual publicly instituted (so consider once again, dear Drummond, just how \"private\" and \"personal\", \"self-willed\" an act the writing of such a letter was!). Now, when people proclaim they'd like a demonstration of, or are interested in, what Drummond terms the \"wishes-can-be-made-to-form, \"Visualize-Assert-Demonstrate\" effect, AAA and MT know perfectly well the \"area\" of life in which they're most eager for a demonstrable application of the Principle; of course, the area of money, wealth! Nothing unique here, perhaps, but to the point! Naturally when people say they're interested in the demonstration of such a principle, they're thinking in tenns of someone winning the Lotto! In terms of the Spiritual Teaching which we're here to demonstrate through the medium of the \"magical-mirror\" effect, there is really no point to \"winning a Lotto\" in itself. What wuld an authentic spiritual teacher do in relation to everyone's obsession with such things as the \"Lotto\"-except prove perhaps that bbYou Are That!\" What could such a real spiritual instructor do, but demonstrate in the only practical way possible by appearing infirstperson, as the Lotto! Like the proverbial angel, the Awakened Being does not so much \"make love\", but rather he is Love; in the same way, the real Spiritual Instructor doesn't win the Lotto, but becomes the Lotto. Is this MT's idea of a joke? Has he gone too far with such proclamations, has he gone off the deep end--or is this just the impossible, preposterous, wholly outrageous yet perfectly Self-revealing Demonstration that he and AAA originally proposed to produce, convincing and ultimately unimpeachable because of its preposterousness, its patent absurdity which nonetheless stands accomplished before one and all, in the Daylight of plain public view? secured as self-evident effect and concrete manifestation against any possibility of personal coordination, supervision or control? Let us quickly go to the basic proofs requiring no special Qabala except a simple \"looking up\" in an available reference, 777 (the standard text on ''GematriaW--or word-name-num- ber equivalencies in the sacred traditional languages--published by Weiser and others) so compris-"},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV ing the most generally accessible evidence, that which is easiest for the public to recognize at the very beginning. (At this point of course we hear the indolent proclaim, \"Why does a 'miracle' require such personal effort, minimal as it is, to perceive it?\" Why can't it be as spectacularly recognizable as the \"miracles\" of Satya Sai Baba, for example, when he pulls a sacred statue out of the ground at 2,000 degrees Farenheit? For one thing, such \"miracles\" may be doubted, no matter how spectacular; many Hindus side with the Amazing Randi when it comes to skepticism re such matters--therefore everything no matter how \"miraculous\", is subject to, and depends on, inter- pretation whether fair or biased. A \"miracle\" is the occasion for acceptance or rejection no matter how \"overwhelming\" it may initially seem. The miracles of the Eastern Adept Sai Baba have to be understood in context; they aren't arbitrary, but accord with the class of consciousness into which he's Incarnated in order to instruct. Thus for the level of villagers [to which he largely addresses himself, despite Western patronage] the most overt displays of the Non-ordinary are suitable so as to draw the attention of an unsophisticated consciousness that would be oblivious to subtle proofs. Western cosmopolitan consciousness on the other hand represents a level of awareness that must be tested at the boundaries of its own defining limits; thus the \"miracles\" performed by its adepts on its behalf must engage faculties of reason and intuitive identification that correspond to the general capacity expected at that level. Thus you're given simple, Qabalistic tools of evaluation whereby the Western intellect may assess--using the optimum power of its own facultative attainments--the degree of \"probability\" involved that would warrant recognition of the Non-or- dinary.1 AM'S Birthday Signature In The Lotto The bottom row of numbers on the Lotto pamphlet features the numbers 53 and 8.

Since \"Magick\" is such a Manifestation, and Qabala summarizes the Western yoga by which such Divine Powers are brought forward into practical expression, it is actually hermetical \"magic\" and the tradition of Qabala people are interested in when professing an interest in the Visualize-Assert-Demonstrate aspect of esotericism. It is all summarized, coded and classified there; it anciently awaits the perennial rediscovery accorded it, when the tide turns again as it periodically does and the imagination begins to reawaken to the hidden principles of producing extraordinary effect: the \"charm of making\", so the expression goes in Boorman's Excalibur. Since this \"bringing into visible appearance\" is self-evidently an esotericism of the Western, \"magical\" variety, we have recourse to certain basic principles of the Qabala by which to analyze and demonstrate the Presence of the Proofs provided here. There's nothing \"strange\" in this; it is all consistent to type. \"Hermetic\" demonstrations require hermetic proof. That our Demonstration is, in this case, amenable to the Western (Qabalistic) Solvent and is indeed an exhibit of the genre, simply attests to the fact that adeptship is always implicitly a mastery of the various forms that spiritual truth may take; regardless the tradition, the test of authentic spiritual adeptship is the ability to produce the essence of a given teaching as living demonstration so as to iden*, first of all, the point at which such discipline or doctrine intersects the Whole-Being value of which IDENTITY LOVE VOID Figure B"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV it purports to be a representation; and, secondly, so as to establish the source of Authority in the living teacher rather than through the writ into which a given teaching has been encoded, and interpreted by its secondary \"priests\". What may make things \"curiouser and curiouser\" for the reader, is that we find our Proof quite specifically coded in Qabalistic grammar in a manner so pointed as to leave no room for the cavil of pure \"coincidence\". Like the faint presence of an Old Master discovered inexplicably beneath the surface paint of a streetsign, we find the \"random\" numbers of the Lotto pamphlet speaking sono voce in unmistakably Qabalistic language. Meher Baba's Famous Last Word, Was A Number Take, for instance, the number 3 1 itself. This isn't just an arbitrary number, nor does it just echo MT's May '90 reference to the I Ching. 3 1 has central significance as a Qabalistic number; but since Qabala is the encoded spirirual intelligence informing, guiding, constituting and explain- ing the whole field of existence to itself as an expression of Divine Being, we may expect it to have application more far-reaching than that of the precious/specialized language of an initiated priest- craft with reference to no \"mysteries\" outside its own; indeed, if Qabala is what it purports to be, i.e. the Language in which the Divine speaks, authorizes, guides and reveals, then we should find \"proofs\" more centrally associated with Qabala solving for other things (even those things supposedly the specialized business of the secular priestcra i.e. science, medicine, physics etc.). And indeed this turns out to be the case. As far as Qabala itself is concerned,31 is the number representation of aprimal Truth expressive of basic metaphysical and physical, biopsychic and cosmic Mysteries. The Hebrew term for \"God\" rendered in English letters as AL, has the numerical value 31 (see below for an explanation regarding the number-letter equivalencies of the Hebrew alphabet, and their English counterparts). At the same time, this well-known Qabalistic equation is completed by noting that the mirror of AL, ieLA, means \"nothing\" or %on-being\". Thus the identity of Divine-spiritual Being and the value of Infinite-Void-being (cf. the precise interrelation of the \"two\" terms in the ongoing exposition of Mother Terasu, ie. \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness'?\" in the T-Bird). The NOT In The String That Ties It AL Together This identity is a central key, whereby all the \"mysteries\" of existence may be unlocked. Here indeed we see how it is that the precious \"initiated\" specialty of Qabala is really no such thing, but reveals itself progressively as the genuine formula of the Whole, in all its parts spiritual and mundane, physical and metaphysical. For note the final proofs of recent \"Superstring\" theory in physics, which purports to be a key finally drawing within range of mathematic equation that coveted field theory whereby all known forces and forms of matter are ultimately identified as a single thing. The \"authors\" of the present form of string theory, Michael B. Green and John H. Schwarz (as reported in the September '86 issue of Scientific American)finally boiled the complex unity down to the test of a single equation. The proof unifying all quarks and leptons, hadrons and fermions and vector bosom, em, gravity etc. by single solvent rested on the ultimately simple multipli cation of the number 16, by 31. Coincidence? Making a \"big deal\" out of nothing? That's precisely right; a \"big deal\", i.e. the multidimensional universe, is made thereby out of precisely nothing (note how unification"},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV theory requires energy intensities through observer-probe of the respective distances that \"weld\" each field and force about a sliding zero value superposed as the resolving term of each particular pattern). The number 16 has its own important properties, that we'll return to; as we see for now, when Green and Schwarz finally got the answer necessary to solve for string theory (\"finally\", because that last simple multiplication gave them suspenseful moments in itself; its simplicity drew them eagerly to forsake their computer so as to experience the gratification of \"doing it by hand\", bringing it all to human scale in the end--and in their enthusiastic haste they mismultiplied several times!) they derived a special number which turns out to be the onlyb'perfectw number between 100 and 1000, i.e. 496. (A \"perfect number\" is a rarity; it's one having the sum of its fractional parts equal to itself, i.e. lR of 6=3; 113 of 6=2; 116 of 6=l: 3+2+1=6.) Note that, indeed, 6 is the first perfect number. It is the number of the central Sephirah Tiphereth on the hermetic diagram of the Tree of Life (see figure B, and explanation below of the importance of the Tree in understanding the \"Lotto\" number-design). The position of the \"Heart-Sephirah\" of Tiphereth, number-value 6 which is the first perfect number, is precisely occupied in the \"Lotto\" design by the large 31 and companion 23. Not only is 496, the number that \"solves\" for Superstring, remarkably enough a perfect number; undoubtedly unbeknownst to Green and Schwan (who have pondered these numerical curiosities, along with other fascinated physicists), 496 is thesum of the numbers 1 through 311 (ie. 1+2=3+3=6+4=10+5=15 etc). Thus the proof for Superstring underlines the central significance of the number 31 in astonishing and unsuspected ways. Happy Birthday Sweet 16 16, by which 31 is multiplied to get the Superstring answer, is a special esoteric number referring to NUIT, the Star-goddess and Queen of Infinite Space (the 16 kalas or potable energy-essences of the subtle centers etc): \"Sweet 16\". 16 is 4 squared; and by Theosophical addition (one of the Qabalistically permissible proofs to which we'll have recourse in this essay) 31 is a reference to the number value 4 (3+1=4). 4 is the number of the Sephirah Chesed on the Tree of Life, to which the (astrological) planetary ruler Jupiter is ascribed. Jupiter is a central key that figures over and over in these proofs, as Jupiter is the planet of luck and fortune so that the Lotto is naturally governed by the Jupitericur principle. Note that the Hebrew God-name AL (31) is attributed to the Jupiterian Sephirah Chesed! Jupiter is the planet ascribed to the Tarot Trump 10, the Wheel of Fortune. \"But wait\", we hear a few hesitate. Is \"Superstring\" so definitive as all that, or is it another of the ephemeral \"proofs\" of physics soon to be supplanted thus rendering 3 1 an outdated figure, and undercutting its \"scientific\" reinforcement of the proofs given here? The answer is that, yes, Initiated intelligence recognizes the basic superstring equations as accurate, and holding good throughout the remaining refinements and reinterpretations. A few of the formal or conceptual difficulties encountered at present with Superstring have to do with their hangover interpretation in the old context of quantum physics; the real place of these \"resolving\" calculations and the proper background against which they should be interpreted, is given in succeeding chapters of the essay \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness7?\"--so watch for it."},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Resolving The Whole-Matter Another remarkable \"coincidence\" involving the perfect, 31-related number 496: consulting the standard Qabalistic text on Gematria (see explanation below), Liber 777, first published in the early part of this century--and so greatly predating the involvement of the number 496 with the equations of physics solving for the \"material world\"--we find that the sole entries under 496 giving the Hebrew word-equivalencies of the number are: LVITN, \"Leviathan\", the material world; MLKVT, ie. \"Malkuth\", the final Sephirah of the Tree of Life signzfiing the physical dimension, the earth-sphere of materiality; and TzRVR, a small bundle, which irresistibly suggests the very description of \"quantum-packets\" and super- string clusters themselves!

It is important to note that the Spiritual Master Meher Baba (d. 1969), said to incamate the Avatarship of the Age, was to have broken his long-term silence"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV just before death in order to \"pronounce\" that Aeonic Word which would vivify and Transform the world, at the very brink of its destruction; at the end, no audible speech in the conventional sense was issued, leaving followers and witnesses to ponder a presumed gap in the fulfillment of what were otherwise often remarkably prophetic \"statements\" of this master. Instead, he wrote one last thing on his tablet, the number 31. Since he subsequently died on Jan. 3 1, it was supposed this was the ultimate reference; but for the very last communication given fiom the \"Avatar of the Age\" to be a simple prediction of his day of death would--though conventionally \"impressive\" perhaps-& itself serve at best to put him on a par with the Amazing Kreskin! One would suppose the very last communication of any such adept would possess a significance more central than this. His insistence he would speak that final Word, plainiy to be heard by all, is only literally fulfilled in recognition of the fact that \"number\" is inherent vibration, and that the Word Spoken through this most signtficant of numbers is indeed the Word heard by all since it informs the very pattern of the Whole! By The Numbers, By The Book 31 is the numerical key to a central, even controversial 20th Century esoteric text known as The Book of the Law (Ziber A1 vel Legis). This text itself is coded in a very specific Qabalistic grammar that derives directly from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, an esoteric society publicly appearing at the turn of the century and having amongst its members the Nobel poet William Butler Yeats and the dancer Isadora Duncan. The Qabalistic system of classification identified with the Golden Dawn is, arguably, the best (most accurate, generally viable) system available within that tradition, though there are certainly \"competing\" classificatory systems (Church of Light, et al.) based on divergent ways of tabulating the relations of the Hebrew letters with Tarot keys and Sephiroh of the Tree of Life etc. We won't here be concerned with the respective merits accorded rationales of the various systems; suffice to say our proofs are strengthened by the fact they are locks which open to a common key, the system of classification belonging to the Golden Dawn. We do not \"prove\" by hopping around fiom one method to another as it suits us. A convincing element of this proof is that it's all quite plainiy coded in one, internally consistent language. The Elements Of Our Esoteric Grammar The key to that language is given in Chart 0. Here we see that, amongst other things, the Hebrew alphabet represents a spiritual grammar; each letter is at the same time a number value, and that is the basis of the Qabalistic system. (This is also true of the Greek alphabet, which therefore functions as a legitimate Qabala in its own right although for purposes of our proofs here we'll confine ourselves to the Hebrew letters and their number values.) Each letter and number value is tallied with its corresponding English letter or letters; this allows us to render Hebrew words in easier-to-recognize form: for example, h, or \"God\", may be written AL in English letters. This also implies that English words can be rendered in Hebrew number values; and while in some quarters this isn't considered \"kosher\", it is still standard practice for most non-rabbinical Qabalists (cf. the books of Kenneth Grant). Arguing the \"merits\" or \"demerits\" of these usages is in any case beside the point. The point is that once a convention is established, the internal consistency in the application of that convention allows intelligible communication according to the premises, and"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV ultimately may be employed by extradimensional forms of Intelligence as common-recognizable grammar solving for extraordina?yproofs (i.e. as in this present Demonstration). In that branch of Qabala we'll be using extensively here (known as Gematria), Hebrew- or English-words the letter values of which total the same are considered to bear some mutually revealing relation to one another. For example, the Hebrew word for \"unity\" is AChD: ascribing the appropriate number values to each letter (i.e. A=l, Ch=8, and D=4) we add the letters and get a total of 13. The Hebrew word for \"love\" or \"beloved\" is AHBH, which when transcribed in number value adds to 13 as well: thus the words for \"unity\" and \"love\" demonstrate a relation of identity when rendered Qabalistically. The text of word-number equivalencies which we'll use here is that of Liber 777 by A. Crowley (regardless what specific practitioners think of \"the wickedest man in the worldw--as the \"laureate\" Hemingway once called him--& 777 text is standard for the genre); we'll only supplement it minimally with samples fiom our own researches. Each Hebrew letter-number is ascribed to a Major Trump of the Tarot; indeed the particular method by which such ascription is made, distinguishes the different systems. The Golden Dawn system which we follow here establishes its method by placing the Fool Trump at the beginning of the deck, assigning it the \"Trump number\" of Zero, and associating it with the Hebrew letter Aleph having the numerical value of one. \"Lotto\" Is Our Transcendental Tree OF life Backwards Also used in these proofs is the Qabalistic Tree of Life with its ten numbered Sephiroh or \"spheres\", to which Hebrew names and astrological attributions are assigned. Taking a quick comparative look at our three dia-, A, B and C, we note that the ten-sphered Qabalistic Tree of Life (representing the whole of the vertical, multidimensional mind-body axis and the worlds to which its subdivisions correspond) may be divided into three basic groups of Sephiroh. These basic tiers are reflected in the tripartite divisions of the two accompanying diagrams, i.e. that which is \"made\" out of the suggestive groupings of the Lotto-pamphlet design, and the three-fold map of the human form which has graphically augmented the \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness'?\" articles. The top division of the Tree of Life diagram contains three Sephiroh, called the \"Supernals\", corresponding to the supreme Spiritual values through which the creative principles of existence issue the manifest patterns of Being; it may be understood as the level of Supercon- sciousness, associated with the area of the head region (and above) in the mind-body form. The middle division is composed of six circularly distributed Sephiroh, the unifying axle ofwhich is the sixth Sephiroh Tiphereth. These spheres contribute the faculties of memory and will, thinking and desiring and subconscious process coordinated through and constituting the locus of centralizing self-reference, i.e. the level of waking consciousness belonging to the province of familiar ego-identity. Tiphereth, then, as the pivotal axis of the Whole Tree in a certain sense, represents the zone of self-reflective consciousness; it corresponds to the heart and its parallel locus in the midbrain (or emotional complex of the limbic system) through which the hormonal keys of the glandular centers are regulated according to the interpretive mediation taking place between the informing Whole-values of the supemal~ortical and trans-cerebral-centers, and the vital-sub- conscious patterns through which ego-identity physically orients itself. Thus the third and lowest division, constituted by the single Sephirah Malkuth, is the resultant locus or compound focal field representing the conditional upshot of the triangulating"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV adjustments and regulatory balances comprising the multi-dimensional process of the preceding centers; its contingency or conditionality as a variably adjustive field of focus is represented in the fact that it uniquely dependsfi.om the infeeding paths and spheres. It is the field or sphere of \"physical\" experience, i.e. the World of Action. Note then that the Lotto diagram divides into these three tiers as well, each represented by a number couplet: the Supernal or Superconscious level located in the \"head\" of the general, vertical figure imaginatively superposed across these diagrams, represented by the numbers 10 and 40; the level of waking, self-reflective consciousness or ego-identity associated with the emotional or \"love\" nature and the heart center, represented by the central numbers 23 and 31 and the foundation level of the subconsciously regulated patterns, the recursive processes of polarization and chronic, cognitive filtration focusing the field of \"physical\" perception (or the exteriorized bodylworld itself corresponding to the hindbrain, medullary centers and the parallel abdominal complex in the extended mindbody axis)-& level is represented by the numbers 53 and 8. If we recall our essay \"Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality\", we may recognize these levels in their characteristic participation through the three-fold process by which \"thoughts\" tend to be exteriorized in experience (and so come to comprise a kind of \"signature\" in the objective sphere, identifying the type of experience with the class of personalized thought to which it corresponds). Summary Of 'Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality\" In that essay, to briefly recapitulate, we saw that ordinary experience through the field of physical focus comprised an ideofoxm pattern of innate meaning in consciousness; this makes physical experience the continuous point of departure of reflective thinking, feeling and desiring. Such thinking takes the underlying foxm of a continuous drone, the automatic internal monologue associatively stimulated intovital drive set at \"cruise control\", i.e. a mode of basically passive or subliminal thinking wandering along the internal corridors of the appetitive \"holes\", the voids of interconnected passage in the tunnels of desire. In this way the mind \"chews the scenery\" like a ruminating cow fiom the efficient point-ofdeparture of the \"gut\" or abdominal locus (and corresponding hindbrain), all ratiodcognitive faculties put in subliminal senice of that appetitive chamber of the physical centers until some stray thought containing a measure of fundamental ego-identity rouses the thinking process to a more active or intentional phase above the self-con- scious threshold. In this way the stream of subconscious thoughts is intermittently raised to the next highest \"tier\", i.e. the ego-center of active or cenh-ally-concerned thought in which a critical measure of emotional Identity is invested. Here the vessel ofthe ego-soul or \"psychic body\" associated wit.. the heart and midbrain, discriminatively quickens that thought to a kindled degree of conscious intensity, fixes or holh it in contemplation for critical lengths of time; the mind-body patterns and correlative, multidimen- sional fields of which the thought is actually composed, become mixed with a critical magnitude of the self-luminous light of Identity (borrowed fiom the Supernal spheres \"above\"). Through this term of Identity the thought is \"drawn\" or aligned into resolution with the head, the cortical centers and (multidirnensionally) the Light regions proper; it is elaborated in all the \"chambers\" and"},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV coordinate networks of the cognitive pattern existing in and through the Mind-zone until it's ripe as an integral seed-form to be issued, in the manner of an \"engraving\"4scharged as a unitive ensemble of complex meaning and implication through locus of the Third Eye. The initial passive desire as which the thought was framed, is quickened to the degree of active will, until the thought is generated fiom regions of self-luminous Identity as a pattern of Void-mind--sealed with the imprimatur of SupernaI or Whole-will at the Third Eye egress so the global sum of its implications shall progressively emerge through plenum codes of its inbuilt pattern, rotated like polar facets in the mirror of manifestation reflecting the \"fiont\" and then the \"back\", the affirmative and then the obverse phase with a contrastive \"severity\" proportional to the rigidity or fixity with which the value of personal identity is involved. This then is the normal, screened \"3rd density\" manner in which thought of the ego serves to generate the stresses aligning transdimensional coordinates of the mind-body field into conformal agreement with the \"energy-signature\" of the particular personality. The alternative of this, as we learned in \"Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality\", is not really the self-conscious recognition and consequentperfection of the technique whereby the more coherent, persistent, emotionally suffused and consolidated thoughts of the ego-being are \"shipped above\" as seeds to be planted in the fertile Ground of Mind, and grown into completed patterns of the experiential field; the real alternative is Initiated alignment or adjustive congruence of the mindhody complex of the ego-being, with the Whole-being Value of Identity, the Creative field of the Supernals. In this way there is no separate, speculative and ruminating \"ego-thought\"; the intentions of the personality are always consonant with Divine Will so that every \"personal thought\" bears the whole-value efficacy of that Supernal signature. It may then manifest with extraordimny power or repercussion; any observable \"friction\" generated in the manifest field from the appearance of such a pattern, does not in this case derive hm inbuilt contradictions within the initiating thought itself, but from the collective \"opposition\" to manifest Spiritual Influence generated through a sphere screened on the whole fiom direct alignment and identification with that Influence. This is admirably symbolized--and breathtakingly illustrated!& the fact that the Joker appeared as a Lotto game hard upon the appearance of Topper; read again the essays \"What Batman Is Everyone Watching?\" in the Aug.-Sept. '89 issue of the T-Bird, and \"MindBrain Behaviors: Why Some Citizens of Gotham Fear Batman and Draw Reactionary Cartoons About Him\" in the March '90 issue. Do you begin to understand the reality behind these Cartoon terms? Identity, Love And Void As Expounded By The Greek PhilosopherIBookie, \"Lotto\" Understanding these principles a little more deeply now, we may retum to our diagrams. Note the human form of illustration C, with its threefold attributions (Identity, Love and Void) corresponding to the three-fold division of the Tree of Life, the vertical triptych of the \"Lotto\" design etc. Nowhere but in the Southern Crown teaching will you find the distribution of the interrelated, Supernal principles across the vertical map of the mindhody form rendered in precisely this order; here then is where we begin our most powerfid Qabalistic proofs that the very specific signature of MT and AAA is encoded quite plainly, even shockingly, in the number-values belonging to the threefold grouping of the \"Lotto\" design."},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Void Beginning at the bottom, corresponding to the vital-etheric, appetitive/abdominal \"plexuses\" patterning the physical field of manifistation: this region of6'matter\" is identified with Void in the Southern Crown diagram (first printed in the Dec. '89 issue of the T-Bird, don't forget). The corresponding numbers on the Lotto diagram are 53 and 8. Adding them, we get: 61. 61 is immediately and unambiguously identifiable to Qabalists as a number of central importance. It pertains to the Hebrew term AIN (A=l, I=10, N=50: 61), meaning, Nothing, Void or Non-being. Love Let's go up to the next leveYdivision, and apply exactiy the same method, ie. involving both numbers so as to unmistakably identify the level as a whole with the corre- sponding principle named on the Southern Crown diagram, ie. \"Love\". The numbers here, as we see, are 23 and 31.23+31=54. The Hebrew word MAVHB, value 54, means \"in love\", or \"loving\", thus giving us a very precise conjugation of the appropriate term \"Love\" as it would be actively expressed through the heartlmidbrain emotional bonding of the ego-soul (i.e. Tiphereth) ascribed to this level. identity Let's go up to the third and highest level, and see ifwe can locate the corresponding principle of Identi@ through the Lotto numbers deposited there. Here again, we follow the rule of consistency and employ both numbers in the proof, so as to show thefun correspondence of this level with the term of \"identity\". Here however we won't add the numbers; we find the principle of Identity encoded all-the-more ingeniously and convincingly for the fact that the numbers 10 and 40 constitute the numerical values, respectively, of the Hebrew letters Yod and Mem (consult Chart 0). The English letter corresponding to Yod is J orI. The English equivalent of Mem is M. Thus I-M. I'm, or I AM: the precise L'formula\" or '%t-person\" expression of Supernal Identity as universally recognized. As the Divine Hypostasis summarizing and \"surmounting\" the succeeding levels and their conelated principles, the Value of Identity may be said to implicitly contain-d subsequently \"issue\"--the explicit tern of Love and Void. As noted in our explanation of the silhouette-diagram in part I1 of \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness'?', Jan. 1990 issue, the triune principles of Absolute Being are inseparable and coeternal, nonetheless they partition themselves in \"specialized\" distri- bution across the Conscious Axis, \"loaning their respective values in differing ratios of emphasis to the multidimensional Pattern of Life polarized through that Line\". We would expect to see the \"secondary\" presence of the remaining principles encoded in the succeeding spheres or levels, and even to find all three principles alluded to explicitly (as \"secondary\" presences, summarized) in the final or \"bottom\" level. And indeed this is the case. At the middle level we have the number 31, one wordsquivalency of which is LA, nothing or void, ie. precisely the value which emerges explicitly at the next succeeding level. (Note here that this ''voidW-value is implicitly present through onlyone number at the middle level; its presence is secondary and implicit at that level.

Similarly, we find all three principles summarized at the bottom level, so that it embodies and contains them all at the most extroverted pole of the process. The bottom level belongs direcity to Void owing to the necessary addition of both its numbers (53+8=61-AIN). bbLo~e~~ is present through the number value 53 by itself, for the Hebrew word MAEBH means bblover\". Similarly, \"love\" is present through the number-value 8 by itself, as the word AHB means &'to love\" or \"beloved\" (also, \"desire\"). DD, value 8, means ''love\" , \" beloved\", \"breast\" or the \"pleasures of love\". 8 is also the number value of the letter Cheth; Cheth, spelled out in full (i.e. Ch*; I=10; Th400) is 418.418 is an important key of Qabala and \"magick\", because it's the number of ABRAHADABRA; and ABRAHADABRA is consid- ered the formula of Logos (Le. the means by which thought issues into manifestation). The term ZHVT has thevalue of 418, and it means precisely Vdenti@\". Refer back to our summary of how b'tho~ght\" is made to issue into manifestation. Thunderbolts Of Jove; By Zeus, It's Jupiter Now let's look at a curious thing, as the next major phase of our proof. As we've said, the Lotto (being a game of fortune) comes precisely under the influence of Jupiter. Since that is so, we might expect to find the Jupiterian presence \"Qabaiistically\" encoded or hermetically sealed in the figures of the Lotto leaflet. Indeed, beyond all probability of coincidence, we don't just find the Jupiterian presence in some of the figures and terms of the Lotto design. We find it pervasively suffus'i the whole pattern, in all of them. Beginning at the top, let's look at the numbers. First we have 10 (keep consulting our standard tables in Chart 0). 10 is the number of the \"Wheel of Fortune\" Trump itself, ruled specifically by Jupiter. This is the first number we encounter in the whole diagram, and it hits us like a very particular Signature. Moreover, 10 is the addition of the numbers 1 through 4 (ie. 1+2=3+3=6+4=10); it has specific re- lation, then, to the number 4; and again, Sephirah 4 . is Chesed on the Tree of Life, precisely ascribed to Jupiter. 777 therefore calls the number 10 the \"mystic number of Jupiter\". Let's take the next number, 40. 40 is the number value of the letter Mem. The letter Mem is ascribed to Tarot Trump 12, the \"Hanged Man\". The astrological figure assigned to the \"Hanged Man\" is Neptune; Neptune rules Pisces, which was anciently ruled by .. Jupiter. (If these associations seem round- about to you, remember these are specifically a means of deriving proof by Qabalistic equations of very fixed correspondence in the Golden Dawn method; and we said one of the curious things about this Lotto exhibit, is that it comes coded very emphatically in Qabalistic proofs of one consistent type.)"},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Let's go to the next level. The number \"23\" is considered an uncanny number. It quintessentiaiizes \"magick\". Robert Anton Wilson devoted virtually a whole volume to the magical and uncanny properties of 23. Because it has the responsive tendency to\"come up\" immediately once attention is turned to it, it possesses precisely the \"charged\" property coveted in gambling, and so is emphatically allied with Jupiter. 31, as we've seen, is the value of AL, \"God\"; and the god-name AL is specifically ascribed to the fourth Sephirah Chesed, the sphere of Jupiter (note also 3+1=4). Let's go to the bottom level Where will we find our jovial friend holding court in this foundational sphere of thevital-being? First of all, note that the number 8 actually repeats itself, so as to be underlined and unmistakably emphasized, at this level. For 53--5+3=8.8,as we've seen, is the number value of the letter Cheth; Cheth is ascribed to the Tarot TrumpThe Chariot; The Chariot is ascribed to the astrological sign Cancer, and Jupiteris the planet cxafted in Cancer. The two numbers of the bottom tier, after 53 is rendered by Theosophical addition into 8, give the sum of 16.16 is 42. And 4, of course, is the number of the Sephirah Chesed ascribed to Jupiter etc. But there's more. Remember how, in his letter, Mr. Riddell phrased the proposition rather curiously: \"Were you (meaning you yourself, Michael Topper) able to convert and convey to myself and others, exactly how such a principle can be demonstrated with consistent success, then surely...\". This was in a sense direct invitation for MT to appearpersondy in these proofs re the principles of \"success\" (i.e. Jupiter). \"I\", \"myself\", Michael Topper, should in some way show the personal \"ownership\" of or identity with these proofs (so as not to confuse them with conjured remnants of some other magician's work littered over the ground!). Of course, this is rather sanctified and secured already in the presence of the last name, \"Topper\", appearing as the new Lotto game-title (accompanied by the enlarged 3 1 which I'd identified with MT before-the-fact, on behalf of this occasion, so that you'd know it was \"me\" and not Johnny Topper or Waylon Topper or Elvis Topper, you know). But let's be even more specific. The leaflet says \"How to Play Lotto and Topper\" (emphasis mine). Arbitrarily, let's go backward from \"Topper\" (a la Hebrew, hmmm?) and take the \"and\" first. \"And\" rendered in number-value is 55 (A=l, N=50, M: 55). 55 is 5+5=10. But 55 isalso the addition of the numbers I through 10 (here we are on that familiar merry-go-round again). So 55 is doubly 10.10 is the first number to appear, from the top, on the Lotto pamphlet; we've already identified it with the tenth Tarot Trump, the FWzeel of Fortune, ascribed directly to Jupiter. Moonwalking backward to the word \"Lotto\" now, we find that \"Lotto\" rendered numerically is 60 (i.e. L=30; 0=6; T=9; T=9; 0=6: 60). 60 is the number value of the lettersamekh, ascribed to the fourteenth Tarot Trump Temperance. Temperance, as we see by consulting our table, is ascribed to the astrological sign Sagittarius; and Sagittarius is, you guessed it, ruled by Jupiter. But there's more. If the word Lotto is equal to 60, and 60 refers in turn to Samekh and the Temperance Trump, it's more than passingly interesting to note that theangel depicted in the Temperance Trump is identified specifically as the archangelMichael. The word \"and\" rendered numerically into the value 10, becomes by conversion the letter J, since 10 is the value of Yod (I or J). \"J\" is MT9s middle initial. So the phrase ''Lotto and Topper\" resolves itself by the prestidigitation of a little number magic into: \"Michael J. Topper\"! (Remember, we're using the same system of correspondences for all of this; aU these things resolve"},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV themselves, in this uncannily consistent manner, using only one system of reference, i.e. the Golden Dawn Qabala-we do not jump arbitrarily from one number-system to the nest just to get tortured \"proofs\".) So MT has appeared personally in these proceedings, by name, in accordance with the condition that Mr. Riddell set forward as constituting \"convincing proof '; we have scrupulously obliged the rules of the game, by \"letter\" and by \"Spirit\". Having impressed one's quitepersonal signature in this proof however, the question arises whether the point of all this is one of \"ego\", or one of Divine Truth. In other words, we're confronted with precisely the question that arises in consideration of the New Age proposal \"you create your own reality\". Just what is the point, ego-reality or spirit-reality? The clear presence of MT's actual name in this proof, forces us to confront the question more deeply. If this was all there ultimately was to it (the improbable appearance of MT's name upon request in a medium over which he could obviously exercise no personal control in any known sense) then we might marvel at the mystery of it, incredulously calculating the chances (in this overt game of chance) of such a thing happening randomly with so adroit timing, yet in the end we'd be left with nothing more edifvlng than knowledge we'd found some Magickal \"Donald Trump\" able to carve his name in Ego-letters a thousand feet tall on buildings belonging to someone else, though right under the actual owner's nose! Teaching, Or Trumpeting So what is the point, ego-reality or Divine reality? If this were ultimately an ego-exhibit, albeit of an unprecedentedy \"magickal\" type, we'd stop here; proof would end with the baffling presentation of MT's signature in the already-dry cement. If however, the purpose and only reason for this is to demonstrate the primacy of Spiritual Truth over the ego's self-frustrating versions of \"reality\", then we should find ample evidence of the very form and guiding principles belonging to the testimony of Spiritual Truth as outlined in \"Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality\". We should find that the only point of this exhibit, is to demonstrate in action the efficacy or uncontested validity of Divine Spirit Being and initiated alignment with that Truth. We should discover nothing less than that such Truth teaches the value of its own Presence, through the very proofs it marshals to establish the fact of its Presence. How Your Everyday Magick- Trick Is Actually Performed Keeping one eye always on the essay \"Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality\" (and the summary of same given in these pages) we will return, then, \"taking it fiom the bottom\" according to the order of the description (starting, if we'll remember, with the vital-subconscious drone of the internal monologue taking its passive point of nuninative departure fiom the appetitive plane of the abdominal center and corresponding, basal brain-lobes). The order of drives and appetites, by interpretation serves to orient the cognitive coordinates through processes of enculturation so that we are \"parented\" into the particular, polarized alignment producing the physical field of perception; and it's this physical field of perception which models the ideative range of our thought-patterns reflectively brooding upon, and reinforcing, the habit of that field. The encoiled lockin of the complex energy-network in the form"},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of kundalini at the spinal base, represents the fateful \"intussuscep- tion\" of cognitive field-coordinates across the transdimensional extent of the mindbody axis, finally--and finely-focusing the stylized cross-section identifiable as the \"fixed\" physical he- work. This lockin of the radiant subtle energy or \"solar fire\" of pram-saki in the nucleated form of kundalini, establishes the char- acteristic rhythms and harmonic ratios of interaction amongst the subconscious centers and systems \"fixing\" the sensory-motor keys of stabilized material perception. As we've learned through previous essays and \"Lightm- reading in the T-Bird, the deep void-value of existence is \"masked\" by this polarized intussusception in the order of transdimensional foci producing the perspectival \"obliquity\" of the physical plane; the field-energy properties directly associated with that deep void value (as which the force of the \"material\" field is secretly coded), become \"occupied\" with another function-4.e. they are co-opted by the general order of physical focus and put to work as sentinels, guardians set to sound the alaxm against approach by the psyche toward their own bliss-void gates! Thus, if you'll remember, \"theta\" waves associated with deeply meditative and creative states appear the ordinary subject only intermittently, not as sign& reporting the presence of a \"calm sea\" but on the contrary, as expressions of disturbance. In the ordinary (non-meditative) subject they represent the emergence of fear and anger, \"fear\" and \"anger\" are the ways in which we en&de our guardianship against the gates of the \"unknown\", i.e. the unexpected, the unanticipated, or that dark frontier where secured \"knowledge\" inevitably drops away: i.e., precisely the forbidden zone of the Zero-value, AM (LA), the indeterminacy of the Void-state which constitutes our total condition, but which we mask and guard against through partial or oblique-physicaljxrspective. Let's see now, if we find this state of things at the physical or material level, delineated by appropriate number-value in the bottom tier of the Lotto design. Shall we find this condition, comprising point-of-departure of our ordinary range of thinking (through which we propose to \"create our own reality\"), in any way represented in the numbers 53 and 8? And shall we find encoded there, not only the process by which the familiar typologies of thought are crystallized into seeds of future experiential patterning, but intimation of the means whereby thought may serve to midwife direct Infuence of Whole-being Value in aligned manifestation of Spirit through the general pattern of experience? The Fire in The Lotto First: 53 is a number that has several, interrelated word-values. ChMH means LL~~n\", SO we see the presence of the solar fire in the form of kundahiimmediately awaiting"},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV our analysis. We know this \"sun\" is kunddini specifically, in its (characteristic) encoiled or \"locked-in\" state as it's in this state that it enlists and holds in place the \"deep\" energy-prop- erties that become buried at the coccygeal plexus and corresponding, basal brain lobes as patterns of fear and anger: for ChMH means not only \"sun\", but \"anger\" or \"wrath\". Encoiled kundalini, in its material-world \"exile\" of divine-creative subtle energy, indeed represents the incorporative patterning of Solar-force as spirit-being in the state of'lwrath\". 53 is MChVL, meaning \"spleen\", which also relates to \"wrath\" as in \"venting one's spleen\"; the spleen performs a purificatory and protective function, and in the oriental system of elements specifically represents earth. GN, value 53, is \"garden\", a word indicating the perceptual profusion of the material sphere, with its many blossoms of \"thought-seeds\" springing up continuously as the luxuriantly-elaborated fruitage of experience. It also alludes to the physical \"garden of paradise\" from which human consciousness, in the form of encoiled kundalini (the descended Shekinah, in the Hebrew tradition) has been \"exiled\", locked out by the wrathful angelic sentinels posted at the Gates. The Stone In The Lotto But 53 is also ABN, meaning Stone (especially with reference to6'the stone that slew Goliath\") and is employed in Qabala as a term of the Philosopher's Stone, i.e. the Great Work accomplished. ABN is the spiritual formula of the Father and Son united, ie. AB (father, ascribed to the Supernal Chokmah on the Tree of Life and represented by the top tier on the Lotto design) +BN (Son, ascribed to the Sephirah Tipheretli or sphere of the sun-5hnd represented by the Middle tier on the Lotto design). AB+BN=ABN, Stone, which we find specifically as the formula of Completion at the bottom tier of the Lotto design. This signifies with little interpretation, the bringing of spiritual unity and aligned continuity between the ego-consciousness of waking life and the Whole-being value of Spirit-consciousness, into harmony and integral identity with thephysicaf sphere and its subconscious processes as sign of real Completion, ie. the accomplishment of the \"Medicine of metals\" or the Philosopher's Stone which can \"leaven base ore\", \"Subiime and Multiply it many times\". The Lover In The Lotto 53 is also MAHBH, meaning \"a lover\". A ''lover\" is the object of love or desire (thus representing the many, symbolically allusive \"things\" modeled by and coveted in thought, which become fit material for \"impregnation\" through the fertilizing seed of concentration; MAHBH refers us directly to the number 8, which has as one word-equivalency the term AHB, meaningbbto love\", \"desired\", \"beloved\". 8 is also DD, \"love\", \"beloved\" or \"breast\", \"pleasures of love\": this \"breast\" represents the maternal sphere of physical existence itself. It is the pleasurable teat from which the milk of nurturing experience (derived from the fertilized, impregnated thought-seed) eventually flows (cf. ChLB, \"milk\", having the value of 40 and so belonging precisely to the top tier of the Lotto design corresponding to the \"head\", Divine-mind and Its creative patterns, the Supernals and oversoul consciousness etc4.e. the locus where seed-ideas are nurtured, matured and gestated as the coinvolved patterns of experience)."},{"pageNumber":683,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV We're suckled, nurtured and weaned on our experiences. The breast is only a potential source of nourishment until real impregnation or fertilization takes place, and that's accomplished through the intensification of loveldesire (-) to the degree of active wiIHntent (ABH, value 8 having the exact meaning of \"to will\", \"intend\"). Do you see the proofs of this teaching sitting here like so many plums to be effortlessly picked? They're all arrayed right out here, unmistakably, before us. The presence of the number 8 at this bottom (physical) tier of the Lotto design clearly shows the process by which passive, ruminative monologous thought in the form of constantly churning desires, becomes converted by a simple transposition into the active force of Wintent necessary to infuse a thought with sufficient identity-value as to move it up a notch in priorities and consolidate it into a true, patterning seed of developmental values: AHB, \"to love\", \"desired\", becomes ABH with a rotation of two letters and so, voili! now means \"wii\", \"intend\". Is this not what we've taught all along, in \"Why You Don't..etcW? This \"mind-manifesting\" process is superintended in its most successful and complete form when infused with the spiritual holism of Stone (ABN=53), the union of Father--super-or oversoul consciousnes~nd Son--ego-soul consciousness-4nd thus di- rected from the Supernal position of true Spiritual Will rather than the limited perspective of ego-will alone. ABN (53) is the \"lover\" or \"Sun\" (53) which is secretly or overtly desired (8) as the beloved (8) by the activity of ego-soul perspective (this ego-soul is directly encoun- tered as the psyche of Tiphereth and its surrounding Sephiroh on the Tree of Life, and the corresponding middle tier on the Lotto diagram); but it is also found by reflection, focused in the \"matter\" of the physical sphere: for ZA, value 8, is the initial-code of Zauir Anpin, the name of the Lesser Countenance or microprosopns--the ego-soul of Yi?tziioh or World of Form, centered by Trphereth. ABN is the secret object of Union which is desired behind all substitute, symbolic or camouflage objects of desire. We wish to realize the Unity which is presently there, and which seems like an active union or uniting when realized. In our superficial ego-existence we desire union or absolute self-congruence with various objects, accomplishments, goals, ambi- tions, images, titles and drives; yet the secret object of self-congruence or absolute-unitive consistency is the Divine (AL) Zero or Void-being (LA) of the ego-soul integrated in direct self-awareness with the Absolute-value through which Oversoulconsciousness manifestly functions. As we've seen, such Supernal Zero-value is the only \"property\" of Being, alone inherent to the soul, which is capable of fulfilling the inbuilt requirement for Infinite Self-con- gruence and perfect unbreakable consistency or continuity under all conditions. And lo! 53+8=61=AIN, the Negative, Void-value, Supernal Non-being or NOT (LA) ascribed by Qabalists to the Supreme Principle, above All (AL), the Negative Veils of Absolute suspended above the whole Tree of Life. That we find it as the \"formula\" of the bottom tier on the Lotto diagram (being the sum combination of the two numbers, 53 and 8) affirms the Hermetic formula: \"That which is above is as that which is below'' etc. and the Qabalistic maxim Wether is in Malkuth and Malkuth in Kether, but after another manner\"."},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV An anagram of AIN is ANI, \"I\", myself, same number value (61). Thus the mutually inverse identity of Self and Void-being. (Don't forget the equation of 8 with 418, number value of the Hebrew ZHVT, \"Identity\".) 61 is also the value of ADVN, meaning \"Master\", \"Lord\"; ADVN is a God-name or title associated with Malkuth, the Sephirah--spher-f Earth, indicating full integration in Conscious continuity between Supernal Void-value and physical existence itself. This condition is alone completion and Mastery. Where initiated awareness isn't fully integrated into and as physical conditions and 'bmaterial\" instrumentality, realization is incomplete. Now let's move up to the proofs of the middle tier on the Lotto diagram, the domain of the self-reflective psyche or ego-soul (by mediation investing the Whole-value of Identity repre- sented by the top tier of \"Supernal Sephiroh\", in forms and objectives generated through subcon- scious patterning-processes focusing down upon and aligning the \"vital spherew--the lowest segment of the diagram). We should expect to find this mediating function (in the vivification and selective impregnation of thought with concentrated vitality and the whole-value of Identity) represented in the numbers 23 and 3 1 ; for it's at this level that a sufficiency of fascinated identification \"enchants\" the awareness of the ego-soul into lingering intimacy with an object or idea, holding to it and \"rubbing\" it as it were with the friction of deep interest until it kindles to a critical degree of impassioned will, like matter resolved to a single consumptive flame. In the intensity of this \"psychic oven\" the seed of a specific identity-potentialLristling with implication and silhouetting patterns of its subsequent elaborationis produced as a real Determinant. Like the \"male seed\" in physical reproduction it must be unified with the complementary \"chromatin\" of the ovum, in order to be \"rounded\" to the degree of true living development; thus the fertilization and incubation process is completed in the \"head\", the top tier of the Lotto diagram, where as we shall see the inherent holism of the womb of the Creative itself contributes the complementary components, the obverse attributes which alone give Completion to the thought as a viable, i.e. truly Living, seed. Glad At Heart Beginning then with 23, we have ChDVH, meaning \"joy\" and \"life\". The emotional heart center where thought is actively held, nurtured and partially gestated is the locus of \"joy\" or bliss; a thought is \"held\" or frozen for prolonged contemplation out of the monolo- gous stream in the first place, because it gives the identity \"joy\", even if the joy of the identity happens to be in morbid or negative, fearful or anxious ideas. And as described above, the excited vigor or amplified fire of the interested psyche is instilled in the thought to give it life; ChIH, value 23, is literally the \"Life-force\"; it means also b'midwife\" (as we've had occasion to refer to the ego-function at this stage), \"lively\", \"healthy\" or \"vigorous\". ChIH or the Life-force is Qabalistically ascribed to Chokmah, the Father (the tier above); the present, middle tier corresponds to Tiphereth, the ego-soul or \"Son\" (i.e. b'sun\", cf. 53 below). Father and Son conjoined, remember, produce the formula of ABN (53), the Philosopher's Stone."},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Charm Of Making 31, if we'll recall, summarizes a complete spiritual formula (&LA, God-Void etc.). Again, 31=3+1=4, the Sphere of Chesed or ~upifer just as AL is the god-name of Chesed; and Jupiter is the planet ascribed to the Wheel of Fortune, with which the Hebrew letter Kaph, meaning \"hand\" or \"grasping hand\" is identified. A grasping hand signifiesprehensility; thus the \"charm of making\", which we see illustrated in the procedures and principles occupying this stage. VIHl (31) means \"and there wasyy-i.e. the 'Tiat\" involved in the creative spell whereby a thought is brought forward as a viable seed of experience. 31+23=54. DN, value 54, means \"to judge or rule\", i.e. to discriminate-precisely the principle (buddhi) brought to bear by the self-reflectively conscious faculty in drawing forward a specific thought for protracted attention. AGN (54) is \"basin\", t bowl^^ or b%essel\", signifying the oven of gestation or heart-vessel in which LHTI (54) \"my flame\" is kindled, ie. the personalized thought-form brought to a critical degree of volitional intensity (ND, meaning \"skin\" or bottle^^, represents the same thing); LHTI, significantly enough, also means \"enchantments\", in this context alluding to the \"spell\" or chann-of-making whereby the force of Identity is fatefully fascinated and fied by a particular object or idea. Note that in the tier above corresponding to the \"highest\" sphere of the Supernals and ovetsoul consciousness, the term AT (value 10) means \"enchanter\", thus hinting at the true source of the patterns whereby the ego is transfied for a season. DMI, (54) means \"rest\", and MTH, same value, means \"bedv-\"rest\" indicates the innate stiffness of the center (i.e. Tiphereth, the heart), and ''bed\" suggests the vessel or medium of that rest; but MTH also means \"stick or rodyy, referring to the rigid armature or stalk of the spine and suggesting the alert verticality of the conscwus axis; combining the two ideas, rest and alertness, we obtain the natural state or condition of the ego-soul (restful alertness) mediating that axis when properly aligned with Whole-Being Value, of which the cerebrospinal 'line\" is the void-pleroma (all things resolving themselves into Void in direct alignment through that axis). We should by now expect to find the rest of the creative formula clearly represented in the number-word equivalencies belonging to the top tier of the Lotto diagram, corresponding to creative Light of Void-mind, the Supernal principles of oversoul consciousness etc. Crown Of Creation Remember that 10 and 40, the numbers of the highest tier, are the values of Yod and Mem respectively, plainly alluding to the declarative Affirmation of Divine Identity: ''I AM\" (14%). We may further get our bearings and know we are in the correct sphere, self-consistent by characterization in keeping with its infinitely homogenous and Self-same Value, by noting that GBH (10) means \"elevated, exalted, high\"; DAH (10) means \"flew, soared\" and alludes to the lifting of the thought seed as it's spirited from its place of initial formulation in the heart, to the lofty aerie of the head-centers. ChB (10) is the \"hidden place\" where further elaboration and incubation of the seed through chambers of the mind occurs. 10 is not only the mystic number of Jupiter and number of the Wheel of Fortune ascribed to Jupiter; it's also the summary number of all the Sephiroh of the Tree of Life; so just as the yogic tradition states that the Sahasrara or head-center summarizes and brings to flower all"},{"pageNumber":686,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the other centers, so we may see the presence of the total number of Sephiroh (centers or spheres) in this topmost tier as a direct representation of its Identity with the Crown chakra, or Sahasrar; and the Sahasrara is traditionally attributed to Jupiter. Womb Of Gestation DV, value 10, means \"Two\" and signifies the necessary state of the \"psychic zygote\" or polarized, binary seed-form as which the thought must be coded in order to appear in the field of manifestation. That two-fold, fertilized character is in fact directly reflected in the YOD (10) and MEM (40) of the \"I AM\", for \"yod\" is the spermatozoon (as foundation-letter of the Hebrew alphabet) fertiiizing the amnionic waters of Mem (Mem is a mother-letter, and is attributed to the element \"water\"). It's for this reason that one wordequivalent of 40 is, as we've seen, \"milk\" (ChLB), the juice or water of pregnancy. Thus we have the formula, described throughout our essays, of the whole-value of Identity (I AM) invested in the fertilized pattern of Intent, Wi desire etc. (ie. the alluring Self-design of the \"enchanter\", AT [lo]). This \"line of thought\", so to speak, is amply reinforced when we add the two numbers of the highest tier, ie. 10+40350.50 is well-known Qabalistically as the number of the Gates of Binah, the Supernal Sephirah of the Mother or Creative womb (Mind) of thought-gestation. ATM, value 50, means \"closed\", \"shut up\" (the incubating womb); IM (50) is the \"Sea\", ie. the creative amnion or oceanic medium of thought-gestation; KL (50) means \"all\", \"every\", alluding to the fact that Everything is brought to birth from this creative Sea. And LK (50) means \"to thee\", the impersonal (supersoul) counterpart to the term LI (value 40) meaning \"to me, to mine\" (i.e. the \"message\" inscribed in the thought-seed, implicitly posted to oneself; it constitutes an identity-\"signature\" personal and unmistakable as a finger-or-voiceprint which ultimately matches the Resultdhe manifesting experience- to its progenitor: the specific ego-soul identity with its characteristic thoughts and desires to which the experience corresponds). It Is, Because It Can't Be Have we shown it? Does the precise correspondence of the pattern encoded in the Lotto pamphlet with the ongoing content and character of the Southern Crown teaching prove itself repeatedly, and at every single point? Those who've been paying attention, with an unprejudiced heart, will already agree. That you're in the presence of what proves itself at every tum to be absolutely Non-ordinary, may however be a point that's difficult to keep in focus and hang on to precisely because it's removed from all the rest of your everyday experience. Yet you'll know it's true, when those who will deny it out of hand are asked how they can be sure it isn't anything more than coincidence or accident, and they inevitably reply \"because it can 't be\". That is precisely right; to the resolutely ordinary and official way of viewing things it \"just can't be, that's all there is to it, case dismissed\" ... and it's exactly when you hear these words as you inevitably will, that you will know it is True. A non-ordinary or \"miraculous\" event has been produced in plain view, for everyone with eyes that may see, to see. Know however, that those who upon hearing this word have a remaining vested interest in vehemently denying, gnashing the teeth in anguished refusal and declaiming upon the \"sheer luck\" of that scoundrel Topper, must find cause to choke on such words as they're said; for this"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV demonstration was produced also as a kind of double-bind pun, a self-refening mirrormaze for the mind from which it can't escape in the internal self-contradictions of its \"denials\"; for this unaccountable stroke of \"outrageous luck\" has taken place with respect to the very game of Luck itself!

And \"how?\" ask all the sincere seekers of Truth who yet can't find the \"mechanism\" behind it all, the \"explainable\" hidden guidewires and backstage props that would draw this whole thing into a little more comprehensible focus. Look then at the inside of the Lotto pamphlet (which we've reproduced in Figure D). Note the numbers arranging themselves in two vertical columns (the \"side pillars\") and the single number in the Middle (the \"middle pillar\"). Add the numbers of the left column (10+26=36); add the numbers of the right column (1+12+23=36): isn't it rather remarkable in itself that these two rows of \"arbitrary\" numbers should add up the same? Both total to 36. But what does all this have to do with \"How?\" i.e. \"how did MT and AAA 'pull it off ?\" 36 is the number value of AIKH; and AKFI means \"How?\" To add insult to injury, the general bafflement simply piles up more thickly as everyone's incredulous \"How?\" is echoed and mimicked and played back in the doubly reinforced number-value derived from adding the two (inner) side-columns! Is there no mercy? Is no one to be spared this infinitely improbable mockery? It's Done: Thus! Let's see. Adding 36+36 we get 72.

Is there any further clarification, (other than this note that such Demonstration was made not for the vexutwn of spirit but out of mercy and compassion for the condition of \"all sentient beings\")? 72 is also BSVD, \"in the secret\". Not very helpful. Like the wave of the conjuror's wand, it is also the value of BKN: \"thus\", \"so\", \"therefore\" or \"then\". So that's how it's done? \" Thus\"? Obi Wan Redux What else.

Let's go to the lone central number, which sits there on the Middle Pillar precisely like the heart-center of Tiphereth. Perhaps it will hold the resolving key. Indeed, 38 correlates with LCh, \"green\" (the color of the heart-center) as well as '%igorw, \"freshness\"-4e. the values we identified as imbuing the seed-thought with the necessary Life-force from the active attention of the ego-soul, Tiphereth. But 38 is also ChL, meaning \"to fall on\" or \"occur\": humpf--another \"Voili\"! It \"occurs\"-\"thus\". ChL also means to \"dance\" or \"tremble\". Does that mean it \"occurs9' through \"ritual (dance) vibes\" (tremble)?

Indeed it is here that you will find \"Atziluth's Secret\" in a form suited to the instruction of this plane; for if, as a final salute to our Qabalistic proofs we add the numbers 36 and 38 together, we get 74 which is the value of OD, \"eternity\", and \"witness\" (ie. the Witness-consciousness of ancient Wisdom); and DO, which is \"knowledge\" or \"wisdom\" itself. This Demonstration solves as well for another Puzzle which had long been posed in relation to the Southern Crown teaching; for the question had been, from the beginning, how a higher-order spiritual instruction of liberative magnitude and factual obscurity with no less charge than to effect large-scale transformation through its presence, could hope to marshal the broad public base necessary to generate the requisite mass-energy (i.e. literally, the energy of the mass!) for moving the proverbial Mountain. Where such scale or empowering Proportion could never come through any direct rapport between the level of mass interest and the degree of spiritual intensity required to lift the Teaching and its Helpful elements onto the plane of the public's attention, nonetheless it could obtain the necessary means through inauguration of a large-scale Ritual making use of the very fom with which the mass-imagination is concertedly preoccupied. It could hope to achieve the same general effect through institution of a cosmic Ceremony, enlisting its p&cipants on a scale the breadth and depth of the State itself so the very name of the Teaching Adept could be chanted with unnaturally avid afErmation- uninterrupted incantation going up to the responsive Vaults of Heaven as fervid prayers, integrally employing the very Moniker Tem'ble and punctuated with a decisive \"Yes!\""},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV We refer you again to the essay \"Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality\" in the Nov.

Any \"learning\" or manifest expository power also accompanying these essays shouldn't be taken as the primary \"means\" by which the content of their pages was derived; \"learning\" is brought to bear on these themes for the sake of the reader, so that hefshe may have ample cross-reference whereby to enrich the understanding of all original matter put forward in these writings, and also as a means of incidentally clarifying data presently describing the position of such fields as psychology and philosophy, science and metaphysics etc. Initiated understanding also funzishes the awakened degree of intelligence serving to refine such modes as are required to properly organize all communication of the original insight; for even that Seen with such inner clarity owing to initiated awakening of the faculties (as well as the Axis of Knowing Itself) must still be interpretively Wed in the available language. 7his challenge is indciently appreciated by the public as an historical matter, and indeed accounts for the frequent impoverishment of the practical teaching that would communicate such subjects; the subtle \"non-linear\" character of the Deep state of things as directly perceived, runs right into the linearity and clunky box-car character of the verbal mode awaiting as the inevitable \"vehicle of transmission\". Owing to the sense of the often counter-rational Opulence of initiated Seeing, the given \"adept\" often neglects development ofjust those powers of coherent communication required to convert the \"subtle\" into sufficiently elastic yet accurate language as to do justice to the \"inner\" data upon the necessary sharedplane. Often this circumstance is an implicit function of the initiated level in question, and can be accounted for by the simple fact that the \"adept\" himself has misunderstood the terms of his initiation, taking it to be more than it actually is. \"Clear vision\" itselfis a function of the initiated level. The more inclusive the octaval Density from which the Initiation proceeds, the more comprehensively aligned and complete the vision-which serves to explain why these principles have awaited the fullness of time in which to receive their proper exposition, as well as their most definitive exemplification. From Number-Magick To Seth Theory First of all, then, reread the Nov. '89 essay; in brief recapitulation we may simply say that it addresses the \"New Age\" doctrine probably first established in its modern form by the channeled communication of Seth (for a discussion of the nature and the limits of all such communication, review the seminal essay \"Why You ... etc. \" as well as the explanatory discussion re planes of \"spaceftime\" and \"timefspace\" in the Nov. '89 \"Channeling, UFOs ... etc. \" Part 11; also the Dec. '89 book review of the afterlife \"John Lemon\" channeling Peace At Last). You may or may not recall that, according to the \"Seth\" perspective, you \"create your own reality\" since your characteristic thoughts are \"signatures\" (unique as fingerprints) that code the energy-patterns through which the field of experience is organized. Thus your experience is a direct (if psychologically \"masked\") transcription of your general cognitive adaptation to the innate"},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV integrity and spontaneous authenticity of your being, reflecting the ease or anxiety by which you interpret the value of that being. Such communication was meant to serve as a means of educating the \"soul\" of this plane to its personal responsibility re the type and quality of \"reality\" it experiences. The Motivation was originally inspired by a recognition of the general, negative interpretation to which the psyche ofthis earth-sphere is educated, habituated as it is to mental reinforcement of \"survivalist\" scenarios structured around theories of \"scarce resource\" and all the competitive inference embedded in such thinking. Pushed to the logical extreme of its implication, of course (a test which '\"New Agers\" are, unfortunately, not in the habit of making) this teaching proves to be strictly a doctrine of commission; what you actively think, desire, fear or believe with the emotionally-reinforced value of your identity, unerringly becomes the corroborative data of your experience. This ultimately means that children who are victims of war, have somehow brought it on themselves (and by interpretation logically deserve the fruits of such thinking); rape victims are uniformly and inevitably culpable themselves, as they must ips0 facto have drawn such experience to themselves through habituated entertainment of some corresponding desire andlor anxiety. A Pseudo-Epiphany This is no \"unfair\" conclusion; Jane Roberts herself and all those who* her classes- subsequently \"learned\" through such premises, continuously wrestled with just those implica- tions-hich were often explicitly confirmed by \"Seth\" through some example! This \"insight\" is often reported by those undergoing est training, who have suddenly \"got it\" as a result of conditioned direction. Such an \"epiphany\" is no such thing, but simply the logical extreme of a premise which is \"forced out\" by pressure-cooker training and then \"valued\" as if it were something more than just the inevitable fruit of a particular New Age seed. The irreducible fact that we must always interpretively appropriate the field of experi- ence, and that we necessarily do so as product of the interaction between our Present state as a \"free-will variable\" and the conditioning influence of our learning-patterns, becomes suddenly co-opted by a set of Expectancies which lures us into converting this term of responsibility into something of another--and uncompromising4d entirely. That we must interpret and thus represent the world to ourselves as something in each moment, becomes converted into a creationist doctrine whereby \"the world\" directly springs forward as the elaborated product of thought-com- mission. (The \"world\" doesn't exist as such until we actively paint it) On the other hand, the initiated thesis put forward in the seminal essay \"Why You Don't ... etc. \" is a necessary Corrective from the spacetime point of view where the latent Totality of soul-being is drawn into expression (as opposed to the \"afterlife\" or \"interim\" zones of timelspace, where the Astral or dream dimension of the Soul-being is in fact simply suspended amidst the outworking variables of its actively-distilled ideas, it. specifc interpretations of what Being and the \"I\" is altogether-presented as sets of plastic symbols implicitly representing the relations of all such thoughts to the integral whole-of-Being). It is absolutely necessary to have an embodied or spacetime expression of Awakened insight sharing the same global plane of experience as yourself, in order to possess a Teaching that's really consonant with those optimum conditions--and thus opportunitiesjxesented within the Global framework, the total incarnate potential of Soul-being."},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality In review: according to Initiated interpretation as stated in \"Why You Don't ... etc.\" it is \"God\" (the Divine, Spirit-Being, the Creative Potential of Absolute) that generates all the multidi- mensional patterns of expression in consonance with Its own Nature (i.e. Infinite Void-being); \"we\", as focal concentrates or centralist \"perspectives\" of Spirit-being operating the coordinate fields of such patterns, interpret what the \"whole thing\" is through the allowable terms of those patterns. Such interpretations are, in measured consonance with the \"Seth\" model, psychically surcharged \"signatures\" encoding the energy-fields through which the pattems of specific experi- ence come to expression. Thus we receive, mirrored back to us, not only the type and quality of our characteristic \"thought\" but the implications of that thought with respect to the Value of the Whole upon which the totality of the pattern is secretly structured. The ''type77 of our thought-identity is reflected against the Spiritual Whole; as embodied spacetime beings \"we\" incarnate the global Value of that whole in our own right, so we are receiving back to us in terms of experience the critical review of our own Total natures. Nothing \"alien\" is imposed on us in that sense; but we do not just get back corroborative experiential output to our interpretive input. All our \"interpretation\" is measured and evaluated against the Standard of the Whole, and comes back to us a bit at a time, modeledfiom all angles so as to reflect to us all the facets, the implications of our \"personal\" self-estimates. Finding A Home For The Fatuous If this is not so, how do you account for the term \"fatuity\"? MT is serious about this-where, in the whole \"SethNew-Age\" worldview would the term \"fatuity\" ever find its place? How could it even be generated to begin with, when, (if such a thing were literally true), a man could simply believe there was no suffering and poverty except that which each drew upon himself by \"personal preference\" and it would be manifestly so! But there is such a term as \"fatuous\". Like anything, abstract or concrete, it must refer to something since it indicates a potential; it reveals a possibility by the very fact that it can be posited. \"Fatuity\" has its viable place, when we realize that it always implies a context. Let MT explain: if \"you create your own reality\" were literally true, one could declare everything by fiar in the bumptious manner of \"New Age\" teachings; every personal or private whim could be manifested accurately, completely, without opposition or fiction, as a permanent fact-of-being40 complications, no implications, no consequences just so long as the requisite \"confidence\" in the validity of the idea was generated. (According to most \"New Age\" and mainstream psychological thought, all that is lacking to make everyone 's reality Excelsior is the great panacea Confidence!) Thus-for example--a man could, with supreme confidence (as someone actually known to MT!) declare that he need not burn in the direct sunlight no matter how exposed-nonetheless, such a confident New Ager looks like a well-boiled lobster the next day. Suppose, again, that a developer bent upon the \"personal, positive affirmation of success\" takes it upon himself to reshape his reality according to his heart's desire by speculating the astronomical increase of profits through conversion of some obscure \"low-rent\" properties kept on the back burner, into mega-buck bungalows for the \"upwardly mobile\" demographically anticipated in migration toward that particular district; without hesitation, as expression of the faith and supreme confidence he has in the self-justification of his aim, he evicts all the low-rent tenants"},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV on the spot (who, ipso facto, must have wished such misery on themselves). A month later, he's mugged in a back alley by one of those he'd peremptorily displaced, and who'd therefore had no recourse to any but the life of the multiplying homeless. In both \"hypothetical\" cases, was it' the lingering doubt, the persistence of some conditioned hesitancy or--especially in the latter case--a misguided atavism of \"compassion\", guilt or empathy which secretly served to undermine the perfect correspondence of desired effect, thereby producing an accurate reflection of the \"negative\" belief-structure? No--that just doesn 't account for it. We can say for the sake of \"hypothesis\" that the given developer had no such remorse (for we can certainly find exemplifications of the genre in real life!); and we can infer that our broasted New Ager is as fatuous as he sounds ... But there's that word fatuous! What makes him fatuous? Evidently, not taking into account the obvious context! Remember, we said the potential viability of the term \"fatuous\" had to do with context! What makes the \"you-create-your-own-reality\" evangelist fatuous (rather than a demonstrable God of the most egregious solipsism) is precisely the fact that all such \"personal decreeing\", \"positive thinking\" and confident imagining takesplace in an inevitable context. There are implications! There are repercussions! No one \"decrees\" in a personal or private, solipsistic vacuum. There is a variegated World of myriad \"pulls\" and \"claims\" coexisting along with the private desires and designs of the given ego-subject. But \"so what?\" we hear the die-hard \"reality-creator\" claim-\"don't we remain untouched by those 'co-existents' as long as we keep secure in the confidence of our own private deservedness, our own authoritative af5mations and specific commissions of positive thought-re- inforcement?\" Report To The Commissioner No. Man does not live by \"commission\" alone. This is why you do not create your own reality, but merely generate reality-hypotheses or scenarios which are continuously reflected and tested against the Whole; and the Whole, being inseparable fkom the Potential of your own innate-global Being, is constituted by the explicit and implicit alike, by that which is produced through active or positive commission and that which results fkomthe gaps, blind-spots and vacuums of interpretive omission. All the lines, potential and actual, exist within one's being and are inevitably calculated into the total account! This is what it means when we say there's a context in which all our desire-formulation and \"decreeing\" takes place. This is a Deity-centered reality, not an ego-centered reality. Only the totality of the soul-nature is in touch with the Totality of Spirit-being. Anything else necessarily involves a partial perspective, a conceptual self-estimation producing inevitable blindspots, negatively-recessed lacunae as well as \"positive\" outlines to be filled in obligingly by experience. What you have selectively omitted fkom \"your reality\", is manifested as well! Gaps in thinking and experience which develop one \"side\" at the expense ofthe other, or which temporarily prevent a latent potential of certain centers or combinations of centers from being realized, do not simply \"pass by\" as a domain of non-experience. They aren't just quietly tucked away as surplus \"potential\" with which you're not obliged to have any relation. On the contrary, such gaps show up; they manifest in the unstoppable/inexplicable erosion of all those things you've materialized as expression of \"personal preference\". They appear"},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV as unanticipated, unexpected or unwanted circumstances which nonetheless bear a negative-identity to the self-selected \"positive profile\". Although the deep zero value characterizing the Total potential of the mind-body pattern definitely allows for what the Ra material calls \"random catalyst\" (a variable which simply cannot be taken into account by the \"you create your own reality\" proponents), most products of omission have very idenrifiable correspondence to the personality-structure in question. They are drawn into the field of that personality as inevitably as the \"positive\" products of commission (like the mugging received by the \"developer\", along with his projected profits). We can of course say the \"victim\" still deserves his fate or has drawn his fate to himself by a quality of callousness embedded in his characteristic thought-formulae; and occasionally this interpretation may touch on some real factor involved in the negative effect. But neither the simple presence of some attitude toward elements of the4tirnate-negative resultant, nor explanations of residual \"karma\" (or anything ofthe kind) may adequately account for all cases in the same category. It is just simply not true that every rape victim somehow \"invited\" the experience as a personal form of \"commission\"; the fact of each Soul being a global microcosm of Total potential, automatically means that a certain amount of experience is going to be the resultant \"invitation\" of sheer aggravated emptiness on the balance-sheet of the (symmetrically self-compensating) soul-record. Note: aggravated emptiness. This then is a magnified deficiency with respect to certain outstanding principles involved in the event; it is a smooth break in the soul record with respect to a whole class of potential, the burgeoning neglect of which progressively builds a magnetic charge placing great stress upon the Whole requiring precipitous compensation. (Note again: in a world where you \"create your own reality\", this potential area of being needn't be taken into account as everything is strictly a reflection of personal commission-4.e. what's explicitly thought, actively desired, consciousIy believed etc.) Since such general deficiency with respect to a given area of being produces a massive potential for precipitating \"experience\" involving just those gapped elements (therefore usually a jarring experience), we may indeed be justified in concluding that such doctrines as \"you create your own reality\" serve unwittingly to irritate the probability of so eruptive an experience taking place. Experiences \"foreign\" and out-of-left-field in nature do manifestly characterize the things that sometimes befall us; they can't just be \"owned\" by arbitrarily identifying some active or positive thought-structure which-by tortured interpretation4an be teased into disgorging some vague parallelism (\"Oh yes, I must have gotten that dysentery because of my dislike for Mexican architecture! \"). It is, then, the standard of the Whole which weighs the balance of thought and Rules on the quality of experience. As long as one is taking an interpretive perspective on that whole which isn't directly aligned with It, the resultant refection of one's personal self-estimates in the form of experience will resemble a maze of fractionated mirrors, first one side and then the other of one's total Presence being represented in the medium--first the overt and then the hidden phase of the overall figure being shown to view. The converse implication of this, of course, is that only in alignment and integral consonance with the Whole-value of Being may Reality be accurately manifested through the medium of \"personal expressionw-for then there is no discrepancy between \"personal\" and Universal, the perspectival \"part\" and the indeterminate Whole. It is under this condition that the"},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"impossible\" can be mested (i.e. that which is self-evidently beyond the power of anyone to \"personally\" manipulate or control). Do you see then how AAA and MT have accomplished this Impossible thing under the noses of everyone? how, despite the disbelief and repeated double-take of the senses, the evidence of their Thaumaturgy is persistently present no matter how many times one blinks, unmimbble to anyone who'll simply look, smiling up right in the public midst of the most avid concentration? (i.e. the \"Lotto\", where no one ever takes his gaze away fiom the shufaing shells?). Do you see how this has been an object demonstration, on an inconceivable scale, of precisely that which Drummond Riddell (and countless others for whom he implicitly speaks) has asked to know? Do you see how indeed it succinctly and fantastically (indeed absurdly!) demon- strates the \"correspond and print out\" reality about which Mr. Riddell and others continue to be so concerned? (for surely this literallyprints out an identifiable correspondence, hmmm?). Do you see how it manifests for your general edification (and education) the truth involved in the \"Visualize- Assert-Demonstrate\", wishes-can-be-made-to-form principle as Mr. Riddell expresses it, without afEming the inaccurate \"you create your own reality\" thesis? how instead it demonstrates inconceivable efficacy and head-shaking puissance as expression of precisely that true Initiatic formula of Being taught as precious extract of the hard-won struggle characterizing every authentic Adept, i.e. alignment and integral harmony with the Spiritual Whole? For, understood in this way (and oniy in this way) it may be seen that unimaghble effectiveness results when the expression of one's \"personal\" will is not different than or removed fiom the Spirit of Divine Will, i.e. the Will to reveal Spirit as the Truth and authentic character of everyone's illimitable Being. This means that, in terms of \"personal will\", only the Spirit of the Teaching Function remains. There is no will remaining in the repertoire of \"personal will\" except that which expresses perfect alignment, integration and identity with Divine Will. This is the Destiny of everyone. Therefore, when we say for example \"AAA and MT\" determined ''they\" would make a Demonstration of the spiritual truth of Being that would be visible to--and identifiable by-eve- ryone in the least receptive to it, such determination cannot be accounted a strictly private decision nor can it be said to be independent of the Wid1 of the One. (In the same way that, where Drummond believes it was strictly an act of \"personal decision\" to write MT his fateful \"letter-of-inquiryw- serving as efficient point-ofdeparture of the Demonstration--he cannot really be confident of the \"personal\" Origin of that impulse.) It's for this reason such a Demonstration, where it truly shows the \"impossible\" efficacy of an Awakened unity with Whole-Being Value and Spiritual Intent, doesn't simply manifest as a \"magic trick\" no matter how extraordinary. It is not just a pulling-of-rabbits out of a velvet Topper, or providential holding of the winning ticket of the Avatar Sweepstakes. Since such a conjuration comes about as authentic Demonstration and Expression of awakened consonance with Whole-be- ing Value, it takes the inevitable form of a thorough Teaching in Itself. It expresses in its very self-revelation the principles and processes by which it appears; it demonstrates through its own contents the Instruction of Spiritual Truth, rather than the stage-illusion of \"you create your own reality\". As an Expression inseparable from the Will-of-the-Whole (and, indeed, enforcing that Will in its very Intent), it has embedded in all its parts the give-away character and tell-tale identity of just that Spiritual Presence, the tireless Being of the Teacher of Man."},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV One last word: contrary to unwarranted popular opinion, such initiated alignment with the Will of Absolute Spirit-being does not result in \"working one's will unopposed\". On the contrary, the very presence of the Awakened Truth in the form of the Spiritual adept has always generated immediate opposition; it has always \"awakened\" a corresponding reaction fiom the collective ego's self-protective slumber. This fact does not belie the Whole-being efficacy of that \"will\" which is so aligned with the Totality. It simply means that such opposition itself, having become part of the manifesting pattern, incorporates as occasion of the Teaching Demonstration as well--& whatever form expresses through the \"confiontation\". Initiated alignment of will with the creative Whole doesn't guarantee \"smooth personal circumstances\"; on the contrary, look at the story of every adept, examine the events surrounding the Masters known to history. Rather it ensures that such events will possess the character of an authentic teachingdemonstration, to all who have the Soul to see. It ensures the Will of the Whole is always done, regardless the partiality and prejudice by which that Whole may be perceived in any given case."},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV [First published in TiVTC Oct. -Nov. 19901 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Dear Michael Topper, Firstly, I'd like to say that it's fascinating to observe MT's extravagant revelation of (dare 1 say?) secrets-at any rate, knowledge; knowledge that others would be guarding zealously and filtering out piecemeal in giant weekend seminars at $400 a head. Within our current materialisms, this fact alone would be ample reason to think that MT is himself fully manifesting the Whole-Being. The expositions in The New Thunderbird Chronicle, as to \"how it works\", evidenced by linguistic versatility, compel deep thought and needle-sharp mental focus. However, there is another consideration which is for me the crux and rub, namely: that seeing clearly \"this is how it works\" does not necessarily help me to work it. Admittedly I may, (to put it mildly), have missed something. Since you seem (benevolently) to dismiss technique (personal decreeing, positive thinking, confident imagining), what is left to we neurotic fools who are wrestling with this divine demogorgon called Life? Surely there has to be a way, even if it's a wrong one, for doing anything? Will not even the wrong way lead eventually to the right one? But these latter are points which overtly you have not even raised: 1 argue with myself for the sake of clarity. Let us then try to see.... You seem to indicate (I say it without facetiousness), \"We are done\" rather than \"We do\". Whemfore fiee will? Can free will be illusion? And can the advocates of predestination and the inevitability of pre-patterned human destiny be the true oracles after all? If it be urged, 'Wo, no, we act and the universe acts through us,\" then we ask, \"How, precisely, to do it-with balance, cohesion-euphoria, even--and 'the charm of making'?\" Perhaps I've been somewhat remiss: as yet I haven't attended your initiations nor obtained your tapes. I have endeavored to move according to \"Chronicles\". Still I'm personally at a loss to know precisely how. Does the Mother Current (a vital key?) flow through us automatically out of meditation? And if so, are we not then back to method? Would meditation be the method rather than decreeing, thinking, imagining? I believe that any Grail seeker is really in search of Merlin's magic: we all wish to act-& the truly \"right\" way, I trust. I'm just not clear regarding how this Whole-Being is \"made manifest\" (or can be allowed to make Itself manifest) in the individual life. I see your explanation: I grasp the idea, \"We are breathed\", and reluctantly admit that each line you write might shine a light on the sight that I decline. As I have always understood these things, the doing and the form demonstrate the Spirit; truly, in esoteric tern, \"a consummation devoutly to be wished\". Dare my narrow and overswelling ego confess that I've altogether missed the point? Or is the answer in fiont of my face, behind my back, under my very nose? Sincerely, Dnunmond Riddell"},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV MT's Reply.. The Big Spin First of all, Dnunmond (and all readers): an \"overswelling ego\" would take its own limit of comprehension as sole evaluative standard, assuming automatically that what the writer wrote was just unintelligible. An \"overswelling ego\" wouldn't write in further questions but rather a declaration of dismissal, then roll over under the covers with a volume of Seth (blanketed by the conceit that such material is somehow \"easier to understand\"). An overswelling ego doesn't creatively review the principal points so as to ask intelligent questions developed from the balance of present comprehension. Thus an \"overswelling ego\" would never find what it sought nor even extract whatever potential might exist within the hework of some such idea as \"you create your own reality\". But the one for whom it's all a creative Riddle, who pursues it diligently and like Jacob grabs on to the leg of the Angel declaring \"I will not let go until you bless me\", that one shall understand. So we will answer that one, and thar one only at this late date; for as we've written in privately printed materials, the current minuscule numbers of spiritual adepts are performing a service of spiritual tiage at this time, i.e. as in emergency hospital practice working through an urgent economy on those still able to breathe, so as to register encouraging life-signs. The rest must be let go. (As was expressed in another Ra source-aot that of Rueckert, McCarty and Elkins, but Gladys Rodehaver, the beings of this earth dimension are unique in their presumptuousness to the degree that, even in the clfierlife stares they carry forward the attitude they already know it all, already \"have it down\" so that inner plane adepts who do approach in order to wean them fiom their insularlself-created [astral] environs and take them toward further instruction, are stopped by a barrier of arrogance and must leave such souls to languish.) Let's back up a little then, Drummond. I haven't dismissed technique, merely tried to point up the limitation of technique with respect to ultimate Transformation. And after all, you did ask the $64,000 question. Technique (i-e., decreeing, positive thinking, confident imagining) works to the limit we 've discussed. And in our several essays we've merely tried to show why there's an inbuilt barrier to the degree one may receive the purely positive benefit and uninterrupted continuity of confirmatory manifestation. (As you'll see, there's also a limit to the extent mere oscillatory \"backlash\" recommends-or produces--the \"spiritual\", through the vehicle of material accom- plishment.) We've tried to show it's not just because you're failing to understand the \"you create your own reality\" principle completely enough. The principle itselfis defective, and not only with respect to the situational context of embodied spacetime beings of 3rd density. Our argument has consistently been that the \"YCYOR\" counsel comes from transdimensional states and planes which necessitate an oblique intersection into our shared domain on the part of any \"disembodied\" or higher-density consciousness wishing to be helpful. There's something about our shared situation such consciousness can't clearly perceive or comprehend, and couldn't unless it were embodied here as well: thus the unique value of incarnate spiritual adepts, i.e. those who do share this plane"},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of manifestation with you but £+om whom the Veil has been lifted (which is to say, lifted fiom this level up). Our description of the creative process (in the \"Motto In The Lotto\" essay of last issue and the \"Why You Don't...etc. \" of Dec. '89) whichmaps the actual genesis of thought fiom desire to manifestation, if studied may be seen to trace the trellis on which one can graft a concen~ated hybrid or hardier species of thoughtdevelopment conceived in conscious consideration of the very principles involved. If ordinmy thought-drawn off hm the ruminative hodge-podge of the interior monologue--may in the course of things so capture a threshold measure in the intensity of self-reflective Identification as to quicken with the coherence of that central value, impressing its character in qualities of the magnetic field to the degree of seeding, nurturing and generating coordinates successively modeling all its global implications, how much more powefily and unambiguously may we produce an effect through informed selection of a seed-idea, enriched with deliberate detail and weeded of incompatible associations, preventive counter-considerations? It's not that you can't \"get what you want\". You can! And everyone is an unwitting demonstration of the principle, one way or the other. It's just that the principle does not belong beneath the rubric \"you create your own reality\". Such a rubric falsifies the truth of the principle, displacing it hm the context of understanding in which it can be functionally valuable. As long as you believe that, by manifesting effect in the phenomenal field through \"blood-doping\" your thought-process (so to speak) you're creating reality rather than modelling a perspectival version of reality against the presiding Standard of the Whole, you'll never be able to account for the way in which the obverse of your positive thought, the unexpected, unanticipated and often personally- unwanted comes around despite your affirmation and kicks you in those pants you managed to obtain by confident decreeing. Yes, you may consciously locate and weed out all the counterproductive thoughts, the negative habits, the conditioned \"fears of success\" or anticipations of failure (although to do it thoroughly in such prescribed, piecemeal fashion is beyond almost everyone's capacity as a practical matter, a real Herculean work of cleaning the Augean stables). Yet even if for the sake of argument you could do that perfectly, the balance of reality does not just reside in the i unconscious^' clutter or personal basement of subconscious contents you've cleaned out! Remember we said (in \"Motto In The Lotto\") that those zones of life relative to which you may bear a perfect indifference are nonetheless valid, possess a potential reality through the whole-value of your being and so comprise a source of authentic pressure. You don't need to have an attitude of identity toward them of either \"positive\" or \"negative\" valence. The Princess And The Principle As a simplified model for purposes of understanding, let's take our proverbial Princess. Born to nobility and insular wealth, an heiress of few obligations and a universe of luxury to indulge, she perceives the potential of \"poverty\" through the tasseled window of her coach; yet she bears no real (that is psychic) relation to it. You may here object: isn't \"poverty\" exactly that obverse of the wealth with which she's identified, so inextricably entwined with the \"positive\" value that it inevitably comes up on the Wheel as a function of the \"coinherence of opposites\"? If our heiress is to experience \"poverty\", eventually, and so round her soul-experience a bit more thoroughly, wouldn't such circumstance always be understandable in the conventionally accepted context of"},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"personal reality-creation\", as an inevitable reflex of the psychic values and characteristic thought- structures to which she clings? Not really; the strictly personal stamp which seals the signature of the soul in the patterning coordinates of experience, belongs to the indeterminate power of thefiee will variable and so isn't structurally obliged to process any particular content from conventional sets of opposites. Though \"poverty\" exists as an objective potential for her, she's not obliged to be psychically involved with it. Here we see the early \"triumph\" of the \"YCYOR proponents. As far as the p~ychic obligations of the personality are concerned with respect to the ''k will variable\", the value of poverty does not have to be admitted as a component of one's active, generating thought-structure. It doesn't have to be endowed with sufficient strength or intensity of contemplation to be entered as a patterning element generated by the conscious purview of the ego-soul. Nor does it enter by negative reflection as the \"secret\" or subconscious concern, the substrate of anxiety underlying a conscious preoccupation with wealth-we've deliberately chosen a Princess, the ideally insulated heiress who never has to worry about wealth, property or possession from aby one. Thus \"poverty\" doesn't shadow her thought-structure like a haunting, tailored anti-value (as it might in one whose wealth in the given lifetime was fought for like a ferret). Because of her estrangement from it, of course, \"poverty\" certainly comprises an unknown for her; and we've previously shown how the metastable walls of ego-identity are manufactured in fear of one 's innate void-being, translated conceptually us the \"unknown\". But the \"unlcnown\" which personally harrows the ego-soul, possesses a different face in every instance. It conforms by inverse reflection to those things that are deeply valued by the ego, with which it is intimately idennified in terms of the ultimate justification of its being. Certainly, as an alien concept altogether \"poverty\" represents an unknown to the Princess; but it's an indz~erent unknown. It's vague, of marginal note only; for our heiress isn't fundamentally identified with her wealth in an anxious, acquisitive manner. It's taken for granted. Her identity is formulated within this context of wealth which is thoroughly taken for granted. Thus \"poverty\" is never seriously involved, directly or by the mirror-obverse of an underlying anxiety, in the catalogue of concern that in fact formulate her functional identity. To our ideal Princess (determining the focus of her concern, her identification and the characteristic contour of her corresponding stress-lines through the \"free will variable\"), dismaying contingencies of life have much more to do with the possible damage to her manicure or mussing of her coif. Though it's true that the personality's fundamentalfinitude and thus mortality is always at bottom the basis of fear upon which the bastions of ego-identity are built, the he-will variable allows for that condition to be sponsored by whatever the soul sees fit. In this way, \"cuticles\" and \"penns\" may serve as the focus of deepest concern; they function as representative agencies of mortality itself, and the viability of the identification-pattern rests upon the stability and consistency of their care! You create your own reality. To the poor, eviction and repossession is harrowing. To the Princess, a broken nail is world's end. Have you not noticed the insane disproportion in the values assigned respective factors by different people, or by the same person at different times and in variant contexts? Surely even our Princess is haunted by the general potential for \"lack\" or \"absence\"; \"absence\" is subtext of an ontological condition, not simply a remediable contingency of certain circumstances. Yet what concerns the Princess in terms of potential \"absence\", is necessarily a"},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV function of the things with which she's truly identified on a day-to-day basis. She's anxious over the forsaking of a lover, the misplacing of an heirloom. \"Lack\" as an abstract value is only filled in according to the characteristic stress-marks of her own identity profile. \"Poverty\" doesn't flood into the abstract breach as an infilling offer of the foxm her finitude may take, because it isn't personally meaningful to her. Since it's excluded as either positive or negative content to any critical degree, we may concur with the YCYOR proponents that it's overborne as a personal factor in the production of experiential effect. So why does poverty come to visit our Princess anyway? Wait a minute; foul! we hear our YCYOR proponents exclaim! Now MT's inventing an arbitrary universe! Indeed according to the principles of YCYOR, poverty cannot come visit like the uninvited guest in \"Masque of the Red Death\"; according to our ideal scenario, the Princess has done nothing of a personal nature (through the k-will variable) to invite the Specter in! Here however is where we may distinguish YCYOR fiom Reality. Now we may take into consideration the obvious fact that all our Princess' personal wishing, desiring, decreeing (imperious decreeing, in her case) occw through a conditioned plenum of overflow contents sponsoring essential ontological values in exhaustless mirror-overlap of correlated states and qualities. The force of Identity flows through all potential, whether it sticks to any given combination of factors as \"personally suitable\". Thus the stresses generated through her \"personal self-esti- mates\" (i.e. her identity-profile) ripple across the total contents comprising the complex field of a given Whole-being focus. There's a fluctuating boundary ofpressure produced between the personal contents (and their mirror obverse) of a given world-view, and the indeterminately extensive \"remainder\" th* in fact, alone descriptively completes the Whole. In this way we may see that, although the contents may be personal and thwefore limited to the defining power of their effect, the values represented through those contents aren 't personal in the least. The value of \"lack\" or \"absence\", for example, which as subtext of an ontological category haunts the condition of finitude, may be described concretely through certain contents such as \"despair over loss of a lover\", the \"misplacing of a precious heirloom\"; but those private contents don't exhaust the abstract value, or account for all the possibilities as which it may impersonate itself. Just as the \"positive\" thought, dream or desire with which we're personally identified represents-and borrows against4 value of Absolute Identity or the Limitless Self-consistency of Being in order to provisionally fulfill itself, so the haunting anti-value that accompanies, informs and eventually dismantles it represents (through the Persona of \"lack\" or negating subpaction) the whole-value Identity of Void, unencumbered by finite form. The Being of our \"Princess\" isn't limited to her personal identity-content; it's constituted by the abstract-indeterminate Values infonning her personal identity content. \"Lack\" may be represented, in the concerned psyche, by \"wony over a misplaced heirloom\"; but its saturation-presence spontaneously surpasses the arbitrary, cut-out dimensions corresponding to some limited imagistic \"hole\" in the head. Poverty may have no correspondence in the personal content of the Princess' pouty thought-structure; but it certainly has a massive reference of meaning with respect to the irnplicit context in which the Princess holds court over her retinue of self-descriptive thoughts. Indeed her precious, private concerns over \"loss of an heirloom\", the \"abandonment of a loveryy, hardly measure against the formidable demands such an abstract value as Lack ultimately makes on the entire context of fjnite identity-investment, or mortal limitation. An \"occasion\" such as wholesale"},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV impoverishment responds in proportion, on a commensurate scale of correspondence, to the blanket proposition put forward by the value of \"lack\" (i.e. \"absence\", \"cancellation\" etc.). If it should upsurge within her experiential Wework as effect of \"random catalyst\" (cf. the Ra material: \"r. c.\" is by definition independent of karmic background, acts of personal will or magnetizing currents of intent), it nonetheless depends for its meaning on the interpretive powers by which the Princess represents \"lack\" through formal context; the effect of \"random catalyst\" is never arbitrq, therefore, but bears a relation to the underlying terms of existence that invited it in-terms which are already accommodated in the thought-structure of the personality, but not exhaustively defined and accounted for in the thought structure of the personality. Thus again, \"you\" do not create your own reality but generate self-estimates of reality, through its informing terms, that are continuously measured and tested against the Standard of the Whole. \"Indifference\" toward something, utter unconcern for it does not automatically screen it fiom the format of \"your\" reality. After all, the \"indifference\" toward poverty of our Princess was not a sublime indifference, but the petty indifference of an insular ego concemed with other things. Such \"indifference\" is part and parcel, then, of a total identity-outline of preferential stresses; it contributes its \"weight\" along with every other factor since it serves to insulate against a realfield. Indeed, although it doesn't generate reflections of the ego's personal affinities and aversions (and so doesn't participate in the processes that loan themselves to the erroneous observation re YCYOR) it contributes to the overall curve of the egoic profile; it produces its own intd stress on the inevitable whole-being value of the soul since it's an effect of ego-negligence-rather than the expression of an Identity at rest equidistantly fiom all potential attachments--ad so serves to bend the lines of reality along precisely those points of vacancy, as in the creation of a suction. In the pattern of such implicit imbalance, a vacuum is created at one pole into which the ignored or neglected contents are certain, sooner or later, to come charging. Pi In The Sb Let's look at it graphically. The active, \"positivelnegative\" reality-shaping scenario can be viewed on the left side of the pie. This is the whole field on which the YCYOR proponents focus. All the \"unknowlls\" in this Wework belong to the concrete contents buried in the \"subconscious\" or bottom quarter of the pie-half (marked with the -). They are mirror reflections, obverse images of the top portion of the pie-half marked with the +, i.e. those active thoughts, desires and expectations of the ego-identity. The minus or bottom portion of this pie half, represents the value of \"unknown\" as the negative potential belonging inevitably to those \"positive\" thoughts above, i.e. the fear, dread, anxiety or implicit negation to every affirmative dream or hope. In the YCYOR scenario, this bottom or subconscious portion of the pie half comprises the unknown. It defines the unknown only by those values that specifically mirror and negate the positive values belonging to the \"daylight\" terms of ego-iden- tity. If those specific, haunting \"anti-values\" can be brought up to daylight or conscious consideration and dissuaded of their force, the prefmed thought will have no secret, subversive competition. Even if the .irrational element of fear can be identified as a formerly unexamined psychological component, however (i.e. in childhood Mom always declared \"you don't deserve to have"},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV that\") the negating factor has not been fully accounted for but only perceived in the shape it assumes through the \"personal\" development of ego-identity. Note that the identity-profile of the personality as a whole (the entire left side of the pie with its positivehegative contents) exists in relation to, and contrasts with, the darkened right-hand half ofrhe pie marked \"unknown\". Just as the bottom left portion of the pie contained specific values of the \"unknown\", the right half of the pie represents the unknown in general. It's that phase of the indeterminate Whole which hasn 't been adapted to the structure of meaning bearing critical magnitudes of concern to the identity-profile. It's that deep region-of-Being put aside as \"unexplorable territory\", to which is assigned everything of apparent indifference to the conscious cross-section or perspectival \"slice\" of psychic focus locked into a field of experience. Yet it possesses a patterning potential as pressurized and importunate as that belonging to the narrow band of concern on which the ego fixes. Indeed, the region of Unknown belonging to the indet~.~. ' .te Whole (represented by the right-hand section of pie) is sculpted in broad outline against the distinct-mntent specific- pattern exhibited by the contour of the left-hand boundary, or \"identity-profile\". Thus the pressure through which the potential patterns of the Unknown region exist relative to the identity profile, is directly proportional to the rigidity or inflexible tension produced by exclusive investment of Whole-value identity in that personal profile or stylized contour-boundary. The more rigidly and completely the whole-value of Identity (equal to the Zero-circle of the entire \"pie\") is invested in that outlined kaf of the ego-inventory represented in the upper left-hand quarter and mirrored in the lower, the more powdy a complementary vacuum is created through which the potential patterning contents of the right-hand portion of pie are irresistibly drawn. The contents of the Unknown which come flooding in, bear an obvious relation to the contour of the identity-profile. The ego-identity didn't create those contents, but it formulated the conditions through which they would be draw and to that extent it determined the \"angle\" of entry by which those contents would have to be accommodated. It didn't create the contents but it styled the occasion of their appearance, and at the same time patterned the terms through which those contents would be received and interpreted. In this way we may apprehend the \"Whence\" and \"Wherefore\" of the High Strangeness belonging to the matter of this month's feature article, and mark the principles through which such events of nonordinary reality occur on a progressively universal scale. We do not \"create\" the current virtual invasion of beings, Fortean phenomena, transdimensional experiences etc. But we may understand how we've imsistibly &awn the whole menagerie through concerted fixation on the exclusive focus of the physical field, our prolonged insistence on the unique verity of \"material\", masked or strategically screened existence. Our millennial overstay at that insistent, focal lockin has produced precisely the cumulative pressure which purses a provocative vacuum, and sucks into the Gap the phantasmagoria of all we've failed to confront or even consider. \"Aha!\" we hear Drummond interject at this point, ever-keen to the tenor of the teaching: \"Doesn't this then serve to bring about the very circumstance suggested as an inevitable effect in the first, Riddled epistle to MT? to wit, the Law of Polarity (i.e. hermetical identity of opposites) 'would ... indicate that the ability to produce material& might act upon the individual as an elevating spiritual force ...as an accelerating superfusion in which enlightenment would be endowed as automatic process?'\" That is, couldn't we take this pie-graph as Algorithm for a persond-and by extension collective--emphasis on \"materiality\" so monomaniac that, for example, it brooks no quarter in its avid pursuit, so focused on the power proceeding fiom physical effect and its possible"},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV causes that like Soviet Marxism it refuses to let mere doctrine or idealism get in the way, tmning (in the spirit of experimental impartiality) even to conventionally belittled \"esoteric\" concepts so as not to \"miss a trick\"? And wouldn't, then, this overbalanced emphasis on \"materiality\" serve as precisely the means, in the form of its exhaustive pursuif for introducing surreptitiously the themes and powers of its \"polar opposite\", the hidden or esoteric wellsprings of existence carrying spiritual value inevitably on their characteristic current? Wouldn't such unfettered pursuit in developing the most powerfd possible means of coercing physical conformance to an ideal of obedience, pushed to such logical extreme necessarily flip-flop over into its qualitative opposite, or induce that contrastive Spirit to crumple the walls of material insularity like atmospheric pressure on an artificial vacuum? The question, of course, answers itself by the examples it brings to mind. Where the cumulative intent along a given path plots a particular profile, the complementary qualities that may gather at the interface of that profile adhere to the spirit of the outlining curve, conform to its originating values by inverse reflection--so that, for example, should \"material subjugation\" describe the basic intent, all nonsrdinary or \"esoteric\" means that may be discovered thronging at the definitional border seem to suggest themselves as finer forms of realizing the same. Their \"spiritual\" (i.e. non-material) factors are conformably drawn in service to physical ideals. No automatic change in basic orientation takes place. One might object that the option for conscious or willed change is magnified; but that depends on an inference which need not be made, and which is not in itself compelled by expansion of the general data-base through mirror-reversal (i.e., \"eloptic\" energies become just another means of giving your enemy a headache). What You See Is What You Get; What You Don't See, Gets You Let's return to our first example. We've seen how preponderant preoccupation with the \"material\" (i.e. the activity we ascribe to willed focus and conscious identity on the \"left-hand\" side of the pie), gives our \"YCYOR proponents data to chew on in the form of corresponding physical effects positively or negatively mirroring the character of the input; this nonetheless results in so gross an imbalance against the standard of the Whole (the entire pie) that the compensatory portion of that whole--the ignored Unknown or \"right-half' of the pie--rushes in to fill the gap with features specifically characterizing the quality of neglect or studied indifference belonging to the ego-profile. At this point Drummond asks whether we don't \"create our own reality\" out of a larger mechanism that takes this major pendulum-shift into account, incorporating it as it were in an organic enlargement of our focus so that \"our own\" self-centered (materialistic) activity has -shed precisely the occasion for acquainting us with the heretofore hidden Whole-value of our being; in this way it might be said we manage to create a progress toward that greater Reality of our own Being about which we aren't consciously aware. Thus Dnunmond would append a helpful corollary to the theorems of YCYOR, ingeniously generating an inevitable dialectic that common reality-creators aren't equipped to consider. Clever as such a corollary is, however, we have to hold its model up to the Light of Reality; and in so doing we find no greater comfort in the theoretical \"inevitability\" or juggernaut implacability of the Dialectic than we did with Hegel. Just as Perfection fails to \"materialize\" down"},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the Omega-line with either dialectic idealism or dialectic materialism, so our resolving out-of-time Samadhi fails to result fiom oscillating historical Syntheses. So what does happen when that compensatory pressure fiom the Unknown, from the \"spiritual\" dimension of our collective neglect comes crushing in? All we need do to understand the whole Principle involved, is ask where the preponderant force of our Identity is located when this irrrush from the Other Side occurs. Where are we collectively looking? Where have we trained ourselves to look? If our Identity has been collectively invested in a virtuaily exclusive \"material\" fixation and control, then the face of the Unknown when it manifests will surely-by and large--mirror that filtering pattern of our identification-processes. Yet since it upsurges as a \"spiritual\" power, with unaccustomed values and unfamiliar cosines of energy, force and property, it manifests the \"familiar\" intent through Means that are immediately unidentr$able to us, which by definition occur past the bounds of our rigid acceptability-margin. When it \"breaks into\" our reality by oscillatory reversal it is not experienced as a product of our will, and thus as something belonging to our active participation or creative powers of coping; when it breaks in it does so as a burglar, a \"thief in the night\" of a most peculiar kind, and we bear a necessarily passive, contingent relation to its presence regardless how its features show identifiable correspondence to our long-term Intent (i.e., domina- tion or regulatory control of the keys of physical reality). Because this Intent to dominate and control physical reality proceeds fiom the \"internal\" strata of subtle or esoteric perspective, it possesses fiom the start an inherently superior position with respect to the Archimedes fulcrum; ail of our exclusively physical focus and activity has succeeded in rendering us passive to it. Where is the balance of our Identity when this extradimensional Incursion takes place? That is the on& question we need ask No, our force and whole-value of identity is not automatically free to swing over to the \"spiritual\" dimension of things as it may be encountered in its own right, or on its own ground. The whole-value of our identity is, of course, quite committed and firmly attached to those very finite, mole-molded parameters that have come to thoroughly characterize our physical focus. If by that half-measure we \"Create our own Reality\", that is the reality we've \"created\"; and the only way in which one ever polarizes out any such consistent, identifiable pattern is through application and committed investment of the force of Identity. Because that left-hand half of the pie is where the force of our identity remains glued (both top and bottom, conscious and subconscious subdivisions), we bear a specific interpretive relation to the face of the Unknown that shows itself from the unexpected \"right-hand\" direction. The character of our long-term, committed identity-investment determines the contours of our interpretation. So we tend to interpret the inrushing Value in terms of contingency and estrangement; we interpret it by deep tendency as something over-against our volitional prerogative, and all its \"unknown\" elements tend to be translated into the inadequate verbal language of our knowledge- structure. This very inadequacy (whether drawing on \"secular\" or \"spiritual\" diction of our collective, 3rd-stage type) seems to emphasize the extreme porosity of the linguistic net in which we attempt to catch and restrain the incoming \"data\"; and that demonstrable deficiency only serves to reinforce the essentially \"passive\" interpretation further. Of course the manifestations of the Unknown generously accommodate, amplify and expand on that interpretation. We're kidnapped, abducted, operated on, irradiated and otheNvise vulnerably exposed to that new, unanticipated and intensely peregrine Reality. This then is obviously"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV not the ideal position fiom which to assay the real dimensions of \"our\" spiritual nature. As we will see in the feature article re such matters as \"The Andreasson Affair\", when the corpus of our \"spiritual knowledge\" has been preponderantly hearsay of the religious-postponement type, filtered through so devoted a physical focus as to make the very subject of the Spiritual dimension-of-ex- istence a perennial question or matter for mental doubt, we must expect we've cultivated an aggravated passivity in relation to that subject. Practiced ind~jierence to the presence and spiritual Magnitude of our Whole-being, leaves us with a molded vulnerability or horizontal passivity relative to that field when it inevitably makes itself known; and our experience generally conforms to that cultivated configuration, \"confirming\" and underscoring it. Even, then, when certain \"beneficial\" values may evidentially spring fiom such lopsided exposure (as in the case of Betty-Luca-Andreasson, see feature article) we can hardly say that this is the ideal or even the only way in which our innate Spiritual magnitude should come to us. Our ongoing belief in our position as \"reality-creators\" (this is not a New Age attitude, just modem labelling on an ancient egoic conceit) indeed places us in the position of deep unfamiliarity with the Whole-value of our beings through which the patterns of existence actually spring, so that when the holistic dimensions of our greater Being do begin to sift through the widening pores of our crude reality-fdter they come to us literally as an alien event. We've invited It in that way. And it's not just that we now misinterpret the influx of \"spiritual\" or \"esoteric\" properties as something over-against, antagonistic toward or incompatible with the fullest values of our particular pattern of development; in large part they're actually so, in conformance with the Shape as which we've implicitly invited them in. It's not that, Strieber-like, we should chide ourselves for misperceiving in those insect-eyes the \"actually\" benign intent of \"our\" spiritual forbears; it is more accurate to say, along with John Lear as interviewed in the book Matrix 11, that we should \"run like hell\" when chancing upon that gaze. Yes, it's a gaze we 've invited, selectively attuned by our preoccupation with control and corporeal manipulation; but it's wise not to own this one, simply because we've had a hand in calling it. We ought not to adopt it just because it bears our imprint! Nor is MT being ''aiarmist\" when he underscores Leafs advice; though literally \"running\" is no solution (just as \"running\" isn't really advice to give the sloth with respect to the cheetah), the meaning here is that we should not be eager to embrace this \"version\" of Spirit nor accept it as tutor to our own interior development but rather should wait on diplomatic relations with even the more manifestly \"positive\" variety of Visitor until we have shifted the focus of value, through will or active intent, in whole-being transference of Identity to the Spiritual dimension of our natures thereby assaying such ground through something much more akin to \"equal footing\". Otherwise, we're at best wild rustics negotiating our rights away to seasoned horse-traders for a handful of beads (indeed, we'll find-+ our feature article--that this largely characterizes our own military already, thereby demonstrating to an extent the karmic repercussions devolving upon our ancestral means of obtaining Manhattan fiom the native-American Indians. \"The sins of the founding fathers\" etc.). Let's take one more example, this time that fiom the \"good-guys\" of the current scenario, i.e. the \"Pleiadeans\". There are of course several sources calling themselves \"Pleiadeans\"; but let's take our final illustration fiom one we feel to be a particularly good representation of what our \"Pleiadean allies\" ought to be."},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Medium's Message-From-The-Pleiades A student recently brought us a collection of tapes identified as a channeled Pleiadean contact; she felt they were of interest since the- teachings given the particular group by the Pleiades-channel were in many respects strikingly similar to our own (though we'd never heard these instructions till the moment she'd brought them); thus here was evidence of an independent convergence amongst Teachings at this time re such requirements as \"power-breathing\", certain specific or \"initiated\" forms of meditative practice etc. Indeed this was the first \"extradimensional\" source we'd heard actually admitting the present existence, strategic placement and activation of incarnate \"avatars\" and \"masters\" (though it's been well known to us they'd been more-or-less helping fiom their \"vantage\" behind the scenes for some time now). This said, there was one particular instruction given by this Pleiadean source clearly speaking for the \"angle\" at which such a contact intersects our physical reality; characteristically, when it came to advice as to the means of generating material effect or \"obtaining objects closer to the heart's desire\", the instruction invoked the very-valid principle of \"intent\" yet med it in a context all-too-identifiable fiom the incarnate perspective as glib. As with so much \"other-worldly\" instruction, the advice was that one simply intend the object of one's desire, step back, forget it and confidently allow the universe to act on the intent by manifesting it The chief disclaimer was that one mustn't \"worry\", indeed our \"Pleiadean\" went on quite cogently as to how earth beings were virtual masters at \"worry\", and were working on their Ph.D.3 in that field! So what's wrong with this? you ask. Try it Pick your object-ofdesire, intend it into being and then forget about it, confident in the expectation of its full and positive mamdi~~ .. . on. Every once in a while, of course, \"by accident\", some identifiable version of such an effect may arise to your field of experience. But not often, nor nearly consistently enough to warrant our acceptance of it as a reliable principle. Why not? Don't these \"Pleiadeans\" whom MT otherwise identifies as having relatively ''valuable\" advice on certain subjects, know what they're talking about when it comes to this stickily problematic theme? No they don't fiom \"our\" perspective. And here's precisely where the value of having available the incarnate spiritual adept may be most immediately perceived. What indeed can the Pleiadeans mean by \"intend, and then don't worry\"? By \"don't worry\" they can only mean \"don't brood over the intended object, obsessively look for its materialization or aggravatedly think upon its absence etc.\" And this can ody mean don 't identi3 with it! This can ody mean withdraw the force of your identity upon accomplishing your formal act of intent. But where, then, does the value of identity go? The answer is significantly different for the \"Pleiadean\" (or a Being already aligned with and functioning through 4th density spiritual reality) and for a 3rd-stage earth mentality. To the Pleiadean, the value of intent summoned to concentrate upon an object, merely borrows against a manifstly Whole-value of Identity which is immediately returned to its restful equipoise in conscious continuity with Whole-being reality. The consciousness of the \"Pleiadean\", in other words, is by definition (being a 4th density being) aligned in basic self-aware Identity with whole-being continuity. Indeed the awareness of the Pleiadean is that of a social-memory-complex, not simply that of an isolated ego-subject. The very force of identity the \"Pleiadean\" summons to invest in an"},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"object of intent\" is collectively reinforced. It has the uniform/concerted energy of the group at its disposal. In contradistinction the masked, fateNly reduceddown and locked-in 3rd density consciousness summons energy-potential belonging to a private focus of identity; moreover, the value of that identity has a specific configuratiori for 3rd density consciousness that doesn't characterize 4th density: i.e. the object of desire commandeers a very exclusive and devotedly invested quality of identity. When 3rd stage consciousness desires a car, a date etc., it is very identified with that object; this deep personal identification in fact accounts for the \"wanting\" of such an object in the first place. Impersonal wanting or intending is virtually unknown at this level. Such one-to-one commitment of the force of identity in the desired object, is corollary of the fact that Identity is not automatically equated in the \"background\" with whole-being awareness and continuity. If that measure of strong identification is arbitrarily \"withdrawn\" fiom the object-ofdesire afkr a period of \"formal intending\" as per instruction, it doesn't spring spontaneously back like stretched elastic into conformance with whole-being value! Indeed, if it's thus withdrawn in obedience to the instruction so that its possible, lingering attachment to the \"object\" or \"fruits of intent\" won't produce the counterproductive command of worry, it simply becomes a provisionallyfiee-floating magnitude of identity. It is not automatically anchored in identified continuity with whole-being value, but abstractly continues as an in-flight potential cruising for forms of attachment. Its habit at the 3rd-stage level is compulsive object commitment. Thus, if the force of identity doesn't spring back instantly upon the object of intent it will nonetheless move, through the unassuaged hunger of its empty value, toward alternate attachment to some other form, item or object out of the compulsively-churnitlg \"interior mono- logue\". Is this not so? Don't you recognize this as being true, in practice? Well, the \"Pleiadean\", intersecting this 3rddensity field to instruct at an oblique angle, does not so recognize this. He may \"see\" the formal difficulties patterned as energy-configurations . . in the human aura; but, not directly living the collective quality of consciousness charactenang 3rddensity reality he is not in the best position to realize the practical difficulty circulating about the provisionally attached state of identity-investment. He does not fully appreciate, at his level, the implications of the value of Identity failing to conform spontaneously to whole-being value in the context of a unified and thus exponentially magnified \"social-memory-complex\" reality. He expects, of course, that the \"object of intent\" will be evoked according to internal priority, so the thing commanding the largest magnitude of attached identity will possess the greatest potential for concentratedcoherent energy investment (and, therefore, for follow-through materi- alization); but our Pleiadean doesn't realize, hm that \"angle\", how even objects within a priority-hierarchy are chaotically interchangeable and virtually equivalent through the incessant churning of the \"interior monologue\" where momentous matters and minuscule matters are subconsciously \"equalized\", commandeering commensurate values of alternating identity-invest- ment as a function of the \"fast frame\" turnover holding the compound ego-image in place. Thus at the 3rd-stage level, simply intending a thing in cavalier manner and then \"forgetting about it\" results in a rapid, subliminal attachment of the force of identity either to compulsive features of that desired thing or to other things of randomly large-or-small moment so that the initial energy-investment is transferred, diluted or effectually cancelled. And this is why the things we \"intend\", no matter whether we subsequently \"worry\" over them or not, don't necessarily manifest as we'd like over the course of time."},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV This is also why indigenous occult or esoteric instructions, where they've proceeded from the validity of a real Mystery School, have always taught fonnal means of compensating that low-level integration which dilutes the force of intent and practically fragments attention into monologous pieces of equivalent, weak \"charge\". They've taught the means of effectually inten- sz&ing the overall integrative value of the mind-body complex through willed visrcc~lization, protracted \"magical\" concentration, harmonization of related desires and thoughts, consolidating the imagination-side of the senses etc. Thus real schools of indigenous esoteric instruction have always taught bm the conditions of incamate 3rd-stage consciousness, and have used such \"magical\" instruction as means of actually getting the practitioner to build a preliminary vehicle of potential spiritual capacity through deeper and more potent keys of mind-body integration. Indeed as we've previously suggested, the two available Southern Crown tapes on Primary Creative Visualization and Full Visualization Empowerment teach the most effective, rapid and powerful of all possible means for \"magnetizing what you want\" through utilization of the correct occult centers and their corresponding techniques--an awakening and energizing practice which itself swiftly opens such centers as the indispensableprelimina7y condition of any spiritual insight or enlightened Realization. And how wodd such Realization come about (we hear Drummond ask) if it doesn't come about as automatic reflex of the \"ability to produce materially\"? Why, the same way we would counsel someone in \"creative visualization\" who could not just \"stop worrying\" about the desired object in the manner suggested by our &nds hm the Pleiades: rather than \"relax\", \"forget about it\" and let the universe perform the burden of your \"unf~lciiug'~, you should on the contrary become very involved in your \"object of desire\", whether it's a car or \"spiritual realization\" you have in your sights; you should engage that object as wholly as possible, and therefore in a highly creative manner. You'll notice that when you're deeply involved in a subject creatively (i.e. investigating it, testing it, imagining it, analyzing it, studying it, operating it etc.) you are taking up the slack in the energy of your identity so you're not worrying about that object. \"Creativity\" and \"worry\" are polar opposites. By doing the one, you absorb and nullify the other, whichever one you're doing. Thus spiritual aspiration has to be directly and creatively engaged as well. Uniquely with this subject of your whole-being value, you must diametrically sh@ the axis of your will hm its characteristic \"ego intent\", to a completely different value of spiritual intent. This can only really happen when the merit of spiritual awakening impresses itself upon you with such persuasive force that you're willing to make so dramatic and decisive an exchange of fundamental intentions. It is only then that you put the balance of your being on a whole other basis. From such deeply assumed Spiritual Intent you must will and actively engage a total creative involvement, with as much drive as people ordinarily put into sex and as much heart as they ought to put into love. There's never anything automatic or casually inevitable about it; nor are you, as some have deductively declared fiom the logic of the YCYOR premise, \"enlightened if you think you are\". Two Schools Of Perfect Peace Have It Out Of course here, we run into the basic \"schools\" of spiritual reaiization which, despite their internally diverse features separate out into two historical types, i.e. the \"gradual\" and the"},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"sudden\" proponents of enlightenment. There is the traditional teaching belonging to the \"yogas\" whether Hindu, Buddhist or Taoist: that of will, effort, progressive achievement in clarification and harmonizing of the systems producing a linear and mechanical culmimtion taken to be the equivalent of Awakening-usually accompanied by signals, sensations or instrumental phenomena. And there's the classic tradition belonging to the Cha'an, Zen or Gyana \"corrective\" to the Volitional school, whether of Buddhist, Hindu or Taoist character: such tradition insists that the conventional methodology of preparatory \"polish\" is innately interminable and misleading, since it distracts fkom the present Wholeness in which all such effort is embedded. It proposes (if we can read its implicit, bottom-line message) that the schools of effort and teachings of will produce \"effects\" from the input of their various \"causes\" all in keeping with linear and mechanical etiologiedus they're viable \"magicks\", means of occult activation; but the truly Mystic as opposed to \"magickal\" forms of realization on the contrary stand proof against effort, belie the conventional presumption of \"effect\" derived hm \"cause\" in the manner of phenomenal agencies and (in the end, as their ultimate Word) purport that real Awakening consists of precisely \"giving up\", abandoning the project of achievement or spiritual acquisition altogether. The \"sudden\" school of enlightenment seems to eschew precisely what we've recom- mended as the sine qua non for any true Realization, i-e. effort, practice, concentration, commitment, breath, creative experimentation, life. In contrast it would ask \"isn't the ultimate Rule of enlight- enment the abrupt discontinuous drop, that definitive pause between beats, the gap in the silent middle of metronome swings\"? This thesis of course, to be properly implemented, requires apracticed cessation; as the proponent of \"easefulness\" discovers, thought and the ordinary inertia of thinking belie the buoyancy of \"bare attention\". In practice, a silent struggle tends to upsurge in the instant of ''just stopping\", so that counter-methodologies are inevitably introduced regardless the uncompromising tone struck up in theory. In this context, any entertainment of Truth as some relative of the \"charm of making\" is summarily sacrificed into the fire that searches omnivorously for the fuel to keep the pot-bellied boiler of aaon steadily burning. The whole logic of the \"sudden\" school of realization can be summed in an image. If we allow a straight-and-narrow vertical line to repre- sent not only our own cerebrospinal channel but the common convergence-axis of the totalizing Present (through which all properties polarize for contras- tive articulation, and in which all properties coin- here as ultimate identities) then an arrow drawn horizontally @om that axis can serve to represent the apparent logic of will, effort, projected achieve- ment or \"ideal completion\" as a chronic displace- ment, drawing the whole-value of the conscious axis \"offside\" as it were toward a phantom target belonging to the befuddling emptiness of the tenses. Thus the Present of that axis isn't itself a conjugation of the tenses; but it is the point of"},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV departure from which the movement of effort and will falsijies its Eternaiity as a modulation in the temporalized ecstasis of complementary zeros belonging to the (mutually negating) poles of \"past\" and \"future\". In this way, the various \"zens\" and \"gyanas\" would show us that the horizontal linearity in the directional and purposive character of Will participates in and activates the falsifjmg structure of time, in effect indefinitelypostpdning realization of the constitutive Ground of Present Wholeness in favor of a nugatory tense modelling some \"ideal\" of synthesized unity. The internal logic of this characterization would require that we quit compulsively sighting along the decoratively fledged arrow (the time line) and draw our attention back into simple spontaneous congruence with its own axis. This \"simple\" and \"natural\" instruction is then gradually supplemented by myriad means of enforcing the continuity of that discontinuous glimpse, that serendipitous dropin on the effortless Present of Whole-being value. Thus arise the great \"paradoxes\" re the \"method of no-method\" etc. Modern teachers and commentators run into the same internal contradictions, and by labelling contradiction \"para- dox\" they seek to cover up a glaring discrepancy between theory and practice-+ discrepancy that inheres in the very model su- the thought of the \"sudden\" system of enlightenment. The apparent contradiction that warranted formulation of the \"sudden\" schools of enlightenment in the first place (thus producing practical contradiction out of the \"resolving\" theory) is that of the seeming discrepancy between will and Being, action and existence. Existence itself was identified as the totality-of-being implicitly constituting and supporting all the activities of its combinative patterns; no matter what the activity generated through a given pattern, it could never produce as its result a value equivalent to its precedent totality. This \"insight\" represents the upshot of a particular historical juncture in the meeting between left-brain and right-brain values, the functions of linear-abstract or consecutive/verbal cognitions and the holism of \"gestalt\" cognitions. The entire theory related to the \"sudden\" school is simply product of a particular way in which the manifest contrast between (what we now call in biomedical terminology) \"left-braid' and \"right-brain\" grasps itself. Such an apprehension, perceiving a contradiction, proposes to force the holism of the one into the function of the other (i.e. the Koan etc.) until the very-ieft-brain--apparatus that discerns contradiction is no longer able to support the identity of antinomies and breaks down, implicitly yielding (a la \"satori\") to the unific operative that remains standing. What then is the problem? Why does this \"natural\" and \"easeful\", \"sudden\" and \"spontaneous\" principle surreptitiously generate its own version of work? Is that just a natural function of its \"paradoxical\" character? or does it betray an interpretive problem that ultimately helps to account for the facultative \"short-change\" regularly resulting fiom the enforced poise practiced upon the point of the present? Let's retum to the summary model of the \"sudden\" school. Since the axial Presence of Whole-being value is itself without condition, available beneath each moment of effort as the spontaneous totality in which all focal subdivision occurs, it may be realized \"any time\". A shift of orientation, in recognition ofthe displacing-temporal effect of volitional \"targeting\", is sufficient. At the same time, such discontinuous insight abesn 't stick. The spontaneous totality of one's own being, is not enough! It manifestly requires repetition, reinforcement, a kind of quiet and fiutive (even embarrassed) introduction of labor."},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The Trouble With Ease The \"problem\" may be located precisely where we found the difficulty related to the self-starter kits of the YCYOR proponents. Whereas the axis of Whole-being Value stands eternally and unconditionally present, the operative force of Identity is not aligned with it. Indeed this is the very reason why \"will\" formulates that directional and displacing arrow to begin with. Ordinarily, as we've come to see, the force of identity is culturally committed to patterns of low-level mindhody integral harmony; it functions through highly anisometric focal grid-net- works based on low-intensity, reduceddown circuits of filtrate polarization. The whole-value of Identity is very deeply invested in such reductive patterns, locked into committed identification with their cognitive terms. Therefore the force of identity is hypnotically equated with conditioned coordinates of perception and sensory-motor behaviors. It is not used to identified continuity with the Whole through which all its activity takes place. It is used to taking the unconditional totality-of-Being for granted as the implicit integrity, the subliminally reliable unity informing its activities and quietly underwriting the continua of all its conditional syntheses. Thus when (as it always may, owing to the innately unconditional character of its Whole-being Ground) the force of identity glimpses the Totality of which it's constituted and with which its actual value is equivalent, it fails to be fully fortified in the wisdom of simple \"cessation\"; it inevitably lapses back into conformance with the term of itsfinctional familiarity. It is compul- sively drawn off-side of even its conscious coordination with innatedwhole-being value. It has powerfirlly invested the whole-being character of its principle in lopsided, conditional forms, delimited patterns and processes which derive the automatic strength of their pull hm habitually implicit acceptance of the background holism of Being, i.e. without direct identification relative to that spontaneous Support. Such tacit acceptance or subliminal \"taking-for-granted\" without direct awareness re the Wholeness of Being, characterizes the jitnctional quality of the personality's identity-investment; and this is why the force of Identity doesn't just spontaneously retire into the effortless Tao when that Value is made manifest to it. Therefore there's no advantage at all to taking the description of enlightenment (i.e. fluid, effortless, spontaneous, easeful) for aprescription as to the means of realizing it. The mandate of \"effortlessless\" and \"easefulness\" directed-as it must inevitably be-40 the quality of low-level mind/body integral harmony and lopsided, polarized identity-investment characteristic of 3rd stage consciousness (i.e. your practical starting-point) must inevitably translate out as inertia, sloth, neglect, insouciance and unconsciousness. The mandate to be Realized in effortless recogni- tion, is equivalent to the authorization for sleep as far as 3rddensity btionated consciousness is concerned; for, rather than settling into non-oscillatory alignment with dest Whole-being Value, the force of 3rd density consciousness simply relinquishes any eflort whatsoever to hold it and, like molasses, flows compulsively back into ore forms of its regular, imbalanced and highly inertial identity-commitments. Is this not self-evident? Isn't this how it always actually works in practice? Have you ever known those \"non-followers\" of Krishnamurthi who, following the master's advice, \"cease all effort\", assume their eternally underwritten enlightenment and lapse without further reflection into the ordinary unconsciousness of their daily identitycornmitments? It should be equally as evident, then, that the low-level of mindhody integral harmony effectually capturing the whole-value of identity and preventing its exhaustivelspontaneous align- ment in restored coincidence with the Conscious Axis, must be transformed. That low-level of"},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV mind~body integral harmony must be drawn to a high level, i.e. one which functions at an optimized economy of processing patterns compatible with the directly perceivable holism of the value of Identity itself. Doing Time (In The Universal Mind) The bud of identity practically droops forward, as it were, leaning away fiom congruence with its own axis and fascinatedly entwined through fibers and filaments with the \"fiontal\" axis, sighting along the trajectories of concern associated with the flat field of various organic plexuses and vital-autonomic circuits. It must be made to blossom and grow upright, straightening its posture 'ti1 it's disentangled fiom the nerve forest of dichotomous identitycommitments based on distrac- tive vital drives, and resolved to its jnnfttp./unific form in congruence with the conscious channel. Yet any such proposal of necessary transformation implies that work must be done. \"Work\" is more than a serendipitous glimpse, more than a modest borrowing which a \"virtual particle\" may make against the inbuilt allowance of the Heisenberg Indeterminacy Principle; work done to transform the b'virtdyy into \"actual\" must produce an effort sufficiently extended to have to \"pay\" for the energy it borrows. The \"he glimpse\" we may get at any time into--and owing to--the unconditional character of our Whole-being, is no guarantor of the unbroken Awareness which alone, in Its indefinite extension, would make a dzference so that our Realization would possess some practical merit, bearing relevance to the pattans of our Being. Such Whole-Being isn't just the \"reward\" of a technical reorientation, regardless how it's been represented to us by various commentators. It's the true functional basis of our peace and productiveness, the Source of our love and of our Genius. To be so in fm it has to exhibit the persistence of unbroken awareness, the continuity of Being identiped infiJl value. The only way in which it can do this, is in conjunction withfitnctionalpattem that don't act to screen or reduce its value. A fortiori, my dear Drummond, it's an inescapable conclusion that work has to be put into transforming the patterns of identity-investment currently obscuring or \"masking\" such a Value. Work, however, is obviously a function of time (oh oh, back to the problematic timeline--the chief culprit in the \"sudden\" school scenario!). In fact \"time\", rather than being a uniform linear measwemat as with the ticking of a clock is best understood as a gauge of transfodon, a qualitative term of action. (Consider: in order to obtain the value of the \"unified field\" in physics where the mutually-prohibitive distinctions ofthe ''fundamental elements\" are overcome, work must be done in observer-probe of the respective distances generating energies of such intensities that, at threshold degrees, the symmetries of all groups are recovered in a basic equivalency amounting to the coveted Common Denominator or indivisible homogeneity of Being. In the same way, work must be done in overcoming the low-level of chronic mincUbody integration through which the unitive value of Identity is subdivided into mutually-prohibitive polarities masking, or reducing down, the homogenizing intensity of aware- ness belonging innately to the Common Denominator of the conscious axis.) Ifthen \"work\" is so utterly necessary, and yet \"work\" is inevitably equated with \"time\", how do we escape the fateful displacement of our Whole-being Present along the treacherous trajectory of the time-arrow even as we seek Its instantaneous Identification? Thinking back however on what we've previously observed re such \"paradox\" being the possible product of just one particular way in which the left-brainlright-brain contrast comes to"},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV grasp itself, do we still find it necessary to accept the values of \"time\" and \"Eternity\" as inherently contradictory? What if the contrastive morphologies of left- and right-brain function don't belong to an innate schism that can only be resolved in recognition of the \"superfluity\" and \"interference\" of the one? What if the \"inbuilt barrier\" between modes of cognition-for which so many self-effacing puzzle boxes of verbal subversion were devised--doesn't characterize the observed system itself, but rather the governing ratios of interaction in the lemright components of the observing system? And, if such sage observation is just an expression of the prevailing stresses of their interaction, couldn't such terms be understood differently according to a different adjustment of their values? What if the operative Metaphor is simply wrong, or incomplete, the product of a particular epoch of thinking? Suppose we cease viewing time and Etemity as contradictory, or functionally incom- patible? Suppose we fail to succumb automatically to the apparency of their \"unlike\" modes? Indeed we might come to see that characteristic Map metaphorically summing the \"sudden\" school hypothesis, yields to a variant interpretation. What if the directional arrow (will, focus, attention, drive, concern) ceases to represent time as a flat, horizontal trajectory of monotonous uniformity regularly displaced across the same invariant plane? Look at our second diagram. The only thing \"different\", is that the arrow is given the additional flexibility or \"degree of freedom\" of a vertical dimension. Yet suppose this slight variation indicates the potential of a qualitative change taking place through the principle of time at each succeeding level. If time is the medium of work, then it may not merely represent a monotonous-dorm passage each unit of which is qualitatively indistinguishable. If \"work\" is gainfully employed to produce transformation or a succession of transformations, then the additional degree of freedom in the vertical dimension of the time line can be taken to indicate a real advance. - It is not just a temporal progression in the ordinary sense of the passage of time; each degree of ascension along the vertical axis can be taken to indicate an overall inte11sif;cation in the operative integrity of the mind/body pattern. The inclusion of the vertical dimension allows the \"line\" of time to produce twists, cuwes, kinks; each such variation incorporating the vertical dimension records-the qualitative change promoted by work. It marks the fluctuation of time as the medium of work, and therefore suggests that time is a viable principle rather than an aberrative fascination. Each succeeding \"level\" in the advance of the time-line may then represent the ARROW OF TIME function of time as a kind of spirallic acceleration of the c p 1 1 1 I I 1 overall field, rather than a linear and horizontal track for 0 R that field. Each instant of elevation may come to represent N E the rotatory \"returnyy or repetition along the screw of that s s , spiral, reinforcing a given \"point\" upon that line while tightening or intensaing the unity of its tum upon its om , axis. Each instant of elevation may represent a discrete or exponential \"jump\" in the \"density\", the overall energetic integrity of the system as an index of the function of \"work'' through \"timeyy. \"At the same time\", so to speak, something else may become progressively apparent as the impact on the mindhody system--made through an elasticized and co-"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV ordinately-variable ''time\"--changes the cognition of time with respect to the Whole-being axis. As the arc of \"time\" moves toward the apogee of rnind/body integral intensity and coordinate harmony-or \"equipotentialityyy----represented through the higher segments of vertical line, the foreshadowing of that self-same axis at each successive stage of the arrow (indicated by the vertical row of dotted lines) symbolizes a dawning recognition--it depicts the underlying fact that, despite the displacement of attention through the time-line by content (i.e. a \"projected\", future event or object) the \"moment\" in which the temporalized cognition occurs is always exactly coincident with the Axis of Whole-being Presence. The shadowed or dotted vertical lines that now \"keep up\" with the dynamic movement of the arrow of c'time\", illustrate there is no--and never was any--real displacement or distraction from Whole-being Present; and that fact becomes progressively appar- ent (thus the space through which the arrow moves is implicitly \"filled-in\" with the dotted axis). This transforms the interpretive metaphor through which such a structure-of-being was traditionally viewed. Rather than \"time\" being a falsification in the face of Eternity or belying Eternity, ''time\" may with a metaphoric topspin be reinterpreted as afinction of Eternity. What if, then, time were just theflame of Eternity, flickering back and forth between tenses as a reading on the \"heat\" produced by Work? What if \"time\" were a perfectly practical-indeed indispensa- ble--principle, perceived as afluctuating fire dependent on the type, quality and intensity of Work--a fire that could theoretically be turned up and up as an adjustable factor operating at various powers through the moving point of the fiee-will variable? In keeping with this metaphor we could say that at a critical, threshold degree in the intensity of the 5ne of time, the whole mind/body pattern produces a combustion equal to the consuming Presence of Eternity. Spirit-being Lives: Everything Is Permitted With practical intensification of the overall, mind/body harmony of the consciousness- systems (or Whole-being pattern) the value of Awareness is correspondingly magnij?ed. (Thus those \"spiritual lights\" prove perfectly false who, like the ignominious imitator \"U. G. Krishnamurthi\", proclaim out of nothing more noble than not knowing any better that \"awareness can't be modified\" etc.) The resultant amplification in the available indices of Awareness produces, at a certain threshold juncture, a very succinct effect: the operative values of the respective tenses remain in place while they no longer mislead or serve to obscure the fact that they're functional expressions of a perfectly Present, Whole-being Identity. Thus attention is no longer dispZaced through the time-line by content (future objects etc.) but reinforced in alignment with the Form through which any such content is expressed, as sufiicient Occasion of Whole-being awareness across the infinite field of the Present. Nothing disappears; nothing is taken away. \"Time\" isn't artificially abolished by repression. All contents are permitted, all forms and processes of mind/body function conserved. Yet they are all changed. They don't merely persist; they are reinforced through conscious existence in Whole-being Value, and participate in the magick of Its creative indeterminacy, Its unrestricted Power. Therefore in answer to the last part of your question, Drummond, far fkom the ultimate truth proving to be some form of predetennination in which \"we\" merely perform the motions of a will already fixed and finalized before the fact, we're now able truly to participate in a creative Wholeness furnishing a latitude of determination that's ultimately surprising (and that we were not"},{"pageNumber":715,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV necessarily expecting!). We have to be prepared for the fact that the \"freedom of will\" we so desire to be true, involves in that very validity an ultimate Abyss. The simple secret is that \"thought\" is either based on ego-being, or Spirit-being. By embracing \"spiritual intent\", we ultimately shift the'ground of thought to Spirit-being, so that all thinking takes place with direct reference to--and as self-evident expression of--such Value. Thought based on Spirit-being isn't \"mechanically determined\" by that fact, secretly produced by some Grand Otherness standing behind us like a Puppeteer; it isfiee in Void-value, but gyroscopi- cally oriented by that value. It is 'Ybkhg\" unerringly aligned with the Whole, so that when it Wills, the inconceivable magnitude of the Whole rushes in to support, reinforce and realize its Aim, since that aim is never incompatible with Whole-being value. We tend to forget, Dnunmond, in all this theoretical philosophizing back and forth that the \"Motto-in-the-Lotto y ' phenomenon did real& occur, in precise conformance to the Will of AAA and MT (and, if examined without prejudice, beyond all possibility of either coincidence or secret contrivance). Thus \"work\" of a very particular type must be done; this has always been the rule. Discussion will only get one so far in understanding; practice must be entered upon, ultimately. Therefore, although you've tried nobly to \"get it all\" through the T-Bird (and have even elicited an unprecedentedly extravagant response from that quarter to fuel the effort) sooner or later you probably ought to just break down, make like the last of the big time spenders and send in your $40 for Initiation; or at least pop for a Creative Visualization tape!

The Bottom Line in 1dentif)inq a True Teacher and Teziching: PART I Those who keep up with Letters to the Editor as a format of swiftly digestible opinion may have noticed that the \"Coco\" inquiry of December re the origin, personnel and goals of the Thunderbird was not really answered in that issue (although inferential answers have been deposited along the way in various articles from the beginning, as a matter of course). Now it's appropriate to address such a question, since sufficient interest has been generated amongst our readership to draw forward the more focused inquiries as to just what comprises a legitimate and verifiable source of special teaching knowledge: how may we identify the genuine aerial Perspective of a Thunder- bird, and clearly distinguish its communication from the innumerable imitative turkeys flapping on the ground (but generating enough breeze to befool those who've only learned so far to equate \"flight\" with hot-air production)? First of all, we return you to our front-page editorial in the very first issue. The T-Bird is present along with many other things in response to a global condition that clearly calls for help. Some ofthe very many ''things\" (joumals, products, groups, campaigns, personalities etc.) amongst which the T-Bird necessarily appears, are inspired by an authentic impulse for service whether well or poorly informed; others amongst that same profusion of profiles are certainly there to exploit the crisis character of the general emergency condition. The confusion of hnts belonging to the overall crisis and vocal caterwaul claiming \"clarification\", produces a deep (if merely implicit) longing amongst people everywhere for the gift of an incisive Knowing. There are many amidst that confusion who'd be swift to respond to the effect there's no such thing, and that the measure of safety in gauging solutions lies precisely in the fact no \"answer\" can monopolize the truth; in this way we approach provisional creatively-malle- able solutions \"together\", am in arm, from horizontal ground-perspectives which are individually partial but which, in combination, furnish an open-ended feedback corrective whereby the \"real\" meaning of all crisis conditions emerges as precisely that resultant group cooperation and hannony. Even in this \"answer\", however, there's the tacit promise of an overview4f only in a creatively-mobile whole which is always more than the sum of its parts and so aggregates an action beyond mere Brownian turbulence. No matter how you slice it ultimately, there's no way to seek a solution (absolute or provisional) which doesn't project a kind of unifying pattern; whether or not this pattern is finally perceivable by any one focus of intelligence, it's still necessarily presumed as a functional minimum. The corollary of this vaguely New Age activist arm-imam thesis is that the persistently implied pattern may be known by \"God\", by some Divine Overview but that collective participation in the production of such pattern is a rough-and-ready process of collision and cooperative conciliation amongst mutually groping parts, intuitively guided as a whole perhaps but never complete in any one of its units."},{"pageNumber":718,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV This idea is comforting to many. It reduces \"reliance\" on any one person or group, for such singular sources have chronically proven to be exponents of an oblique perspective rather than the Whole Vision advertised; the corrective to that seems most naturally to be a pooled multiplicity of perspectives summing to a functional Mean which corresponds to no single element on a one-to-one basis. Yet it must be understood this syncretic ideal is as much an unproved proposition as any other. It's as hypothetical as the idea of a \"single\" comprehensive knowledge. In fact there are many who instinctively flinch before this \"collective\" proposition with as much reservation as is exhibited for competing proposals, feeling that the sum of many blind components can't possibly add to Sight. There's equal historical \"evidence\" to show such synergistic acceleration from multiple inputs only speeds the collective vehicle to the brink of disaster more swiftly, since an initial deviation due to faulty ground-level perspective multiplied by an exponent only magnifies the basic fault into a fault-line, quivering to crack with the falling of the next straw. Wild Card This brings us indeed to the insertion of an additional factor which doesn't escape the notice even of those who put stock in the alloy of \"collective accomplishment\": the factor of the unpredictable, the constitutionally-indeterminate input--the Wild Card, the ungovernable variable, the element of Chaos which, even though demonstrating unsuspected pattern and even beautiful form (as we find in chaos theory) nonetheless defies linearprediction in its process. There's the inescapable factor, the presence of the intransigently nonlinear which as science confesses actually accounts for most of everything we perceive in the realm of effect So we may extol the virtues of pooling our collective ground-level perspectives and horizontally-equivalent estimates of \"what is\" and what need be done in order to avert the trap of reliance on a \"non-verifiable\" Special Perspective; but, as good New Agers (and most everyone else) will do, we turn covertly to consult just some such \"special perspective\" in the form of seer, astrologer, psychic etc. in very respectful regard of that stubbornly-contrary Unpredictable presence, the upsurge of the chaotic variable ... the little ticking timebomb of quake, tsunami or the fateful flicker of insanity in the unsurveyable mind of Someone having too much power under a heavy thumb. Stacking the Deck Indeed our collective \"rational\" mind always reserves space for the possibility of some such seership simply as a mechanism of talismanic protection against that one despoiling variable, the unreadably random factor. We keep that extra-normal possibility over in the comer in the form of various, available soothsayers; we do give credence to that \"special overview\" or insight after all, we must in some way if only as a psychological rabbit's foot to cover the unmanageable margins of life. Yet we propose to keep the provisional \"power\" loaned such Outlook (by grace of our begrudged credence) within reviewable limits. We control and tame that Special Perspective even"},{"pageNumber":719,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV as we expect it to furnish the insight that will help us control and contain within bitesize bounds the conventionally \"ungovernable\" factor; for we place a tacit condition on what it may tell us fkom its special Perspective. We demand that it predict for us the \"what\" and \"when\", but that it keep any insight as to WHY to itself-or tell us \"why\" only up to what our prefigured, personal tolerance- levels are able to accept without the obligation to modify or upgrade themselves. This was the substance of MT's essay of last month (The 90s, Prepare for LIFE) appearing simultaneously in the T-Bird (intact) and the Whole Life Times (not-so-intact). That essay should be consulted again, and as many times as necessary to master the point re what we demand psychologically and therefore admit (albeit reluctantly) into our purview of possibilities, while restricting and often crippling the degree of real benefit we could derive from our implicit acceptance of such potential through just those same psychological demands. There remains, then, the persistent hope for--and even intuitive recognition of--a \"perspective\" which proceeds &om the ove~ew of the Whole and is at the same time communi- cable, knowable, transmissible through some accessible agency so benefit &om that viewpoint may be obtained. We know we are supposed to have precedents for the communication of just such \"privileged\" perspective; all our historical and cultural traditions insist on the fact of such communication, if they differ over particular contents. But the only \"sure\" and \"safe\" existence of such communication seems to abide in the past. Current candidates for such sources of communi- cation seem inevitably embroiled in controversy. But then there should be no surprise in this; as a million commentators have already noted, the dead are inevitably safer and more subject to the certitude of one's own interpretation than the living. Knowledge In The Biblical Sense Yet the past and \"precedent\" still seem to suggest to us the means of interpreting any current candidate to supernormal legitimacy. If for example we take our own \"Western\" tradition as embodied in the Bible, we find two distinct means of intercepting and interpreting extraordinary communication: that text not only divides down the middle but gives us an actual sequence, a mode of progression in the presentation of Extxmonaal News. The Old Testament is rife with examples that are the proper equivalent of channeling (i.e. holy prophets given to trance states in which a Source independent or functionally \"beyond\" the limited personality-expression imparts informa- tion purporting to proceed &om the Whole Itself); and the New Testament in which that very Whole is in some perplexing Way represented by and embodied in the living personality-expression. Indeed our search for the reliable appearance of some such modemday communication, always fluctuates between the poles established by that ancient textual precedent. We believe, alternatively, that we've located and identified a living (incarnate) embodi- ment of such transpersonal Knowing expressive of the Whole; and that we've isolated a dependably authentic channeled source of such knowledge in which the embodied personality is gratifyingly unextraordinary, \"just like us\", but at the same time empowers the norm by demonstrating some capacity to operate as Telephone, Keyboard or Etch-A-Sketch for an invisible source that does possess the requisite Vision-insight and direct knowing. We believe in the directly-incarnate or embodied version of the classic alternative, until such time as we get the impression that the \"human\" part might significantly outweigh the \"divine\" part. Alternatively then we subscribe to the superiority and inbuilt safeguard of channeled knowl- edge until such time as it becomes all-too-apparent that the \"neutral\" channeler inevitably has more"},{"pageNumber":720,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV to do with the nature and value of the communication than is accountable by the standard of neutrality, and that the certifiability of an extra-mundane source doesn't automatically certifL its impersonal and benign character. Since neither possibility between these classic alternatives can fimish a definitive superiority or reliability over the other, we are back again at the doorstep of the on@ premise: if we need a kind of guidance beyond any (single or combined) conjectural estimate, how may we identify it? If we persistently intuit a potential within ourselves, all-but-formless, an intimation of the Soul that sits (as yet) unreachable within its egg, the Spirit-unity through which everything is certain to go evenly in the end, it's hard to pretend to do without it for long. If we sense its presence accurately rather than through the impatient presumption of the ego, we know perfectly well it's as yet out of reach, the invisible being of ourselves still in incubation. We know equally that where there's a chick, an embryonic stirring of life, there's a parent-the awakened Form that can be touched, that is within reach and which is always the proper source of nurturance, the model and agency of development. If we persistently intuit the Existence of that developed Form of ourselves despite every letdown, every false start and red herring that seems to comprise the sum of what so fbr has turned up, how may we spare ourselves the precious time and effort in weeding the profusion of evewhing that is not it? How may we recognize the Perspective of the overshadowing Thunderbird? how may we know even in our apparently earth-bound state that the communication we receive issues from a truly Aerial viewpoint, that it accurately reports the vista as Perceived from the vantage of a wingspan so immense we fiil to take it in, so tender it cradles each as proper to its kind that it may raise each up (in realization of the formless potential felt) in the very likeness of its Form? The Mighty Thunderbird Who, What, When, Where and Why, then, is The Thunderbird? There is global crisis, physical dilemma, ecological and related immunological catastro- phe; and these things naturally preoccupy the collective attention representing the Salient to be addressed in any extension of help. Note then that according to Indian tradition, the consorts of the mythic Thunderbird and its symbolic surrogates are to be found in ''terrestrial\" creatures of the air such as hawks and falcons, eagles and owls. The great T-Bird is often depicted with this retinue of feathered correspondents accompanying It from wingtip to wingtip in Its flight. These creatures which occur in nature represent the physical and biological concern, the immediate terrestrial condition the T-Bird addresses. But the T-Bird Itself is \"mythical\"; while it bears a relation and identifiable resemblance to those creatures occuring in nature, indeed is composed of their compound attributes, It is also endowed with Its own characteristic traits that clearly distinguish It fiom the strictly \"known\" and identify It with the decidedly archetypal. The T-Bird Itself then not only participates in the \"known\", the things of terrestrial concern, but extends Its characterization into the Domain of the Sacred, the psychiclspiritual archetype producing a significance that shoots like lightning from Its wingtips and announces a Presence conveying more-than-the-material, which speaks directly of and from the spiritual domain itself where the whole is Known not only by its material components but through its psychic and emotional, mental and noetic values as well."},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV You have undoubtedly noticed, over time, that despite the diversity of subject-matter and mode of expression there's the presence of one .''MT\" appearing and disappearing, arising as Monty Tyson in the review section, materializing as Mick Trumpet through the cartoon Hal 0.

And of course there's a certain signature style of \"arts and letters\" causing those who've caught on most belatedly, to chide themselves for not having noticed the self-same tracks of that MT imprint in the snow (initials which themselves, of course, function conceptually the way a Necker cube functions visually, since MT is at once \"mountain\" and \"empty\"4or everyone groaning at the gracelessness of our having pointed out this naturally-occurring curiosity of inversion perspective, there are those even now who are doubtless deeply grateful for having been explicitly shown what otheNvise would have escaped them!). In any case, this whole demonstration over the past half-year has been quite leisurely. There has been no hurry to disclose its \"secret\", for the simple reason such disclosure in itself isn't the point. Having been exposed to the presence of the T-Bird for this long and having \"caught on\" at best by increments and cumulative hints, you must ask yourself what it has been that's really greeted you from these pages. Has it been the simple idiosyncratic expression of a \"single personality\"? Has it seemed all along to convey the narrow and ultimately doctrioaire viewpoint of a solitary agent? Has it seemed first of all a \"tour de force\", a specialized expression of one man or one woman grinding the one sole axe that characteristically belongs to one self-enclosed ego-being? Despite the fact that long-term expo- sure may have secured some certainty of a unific presence, is it not possible in reflecting on one's reactions and subliminal intimations that what was feltfirst through such stylistic unity was an integral energy, a presence more akin to a coher- ent passion diversely expressed than to a single, oblique-angle perspective? In contemplating the various features, art, articles, topics and consid- erations presented to you through the T-Bird you must ask yourself: is it really so much that the experience was of a single ego-identity lurking behind the scenes, manically manipulating all the pulleys, curtains and painted flats himself?

Is it even now evidently a matter of a single party pushing his \"angle\", his private focus through this present disclosure of the Method and Demonstration that has been, and is, the T-Bird? Who does this kind of thing? Where has it ever been done before? If you were made to understand that all articles in their diverse expression, their appropriately-tailored tone and adapted variations of style as well as all artwork were never drawn month to month fiom a leisurely backlog but were monthly fashioned for current consideration of the readership, produced on the spot in great surplus (as the T-Bird Ed. may testify) so that it has always been financial limitation alone keeping the T-Bird fiom being a 50 page monthly or 75 page monthly, would you begin to wonder a little what would possess the ego of this dimension to do such a thing, to address you with such self-renewed fever on so many levels through every draftable means (i-e. book and movie reviews, cartoon-comics, magical acts and mystic card-readings) to wake you up at this eleventh hour? In the face of an evident Project that has more than once expressed its editorial refusal to Sacrifice quality-or degree of precision in keeping with the requirements of the subject-to render its material more \"palatable\" to the unreal statistical cross-section (purportedly unable to take anything that doesn't come in a Gerbers container), would you begin to wonder what kind of \"ego\" could sustain that intensity against every knowledgeable oddsmaker in the Empire of Entertainment? As everyone ought to know by now, a bid for \"conquest\"panders to the lowest common denominator, it doesn't speak to the level of which you're capable with effort4or it's precisely that proviso of efort which detractors and timorous pundits count on you won 't make, banking that you'll cleave to the line of least resistance down the broad middle placing you in perpetual harm's way of their fast-food facsimiles and puerile pdes-where everything's blended in convenient cliche-fiappk on a sucker socle, always at fingertip ready of their own reach. Has it been, then, one monoplane display indicative of the ego of this dimension which has greeted you month to month? Is the ubiquitous presence of \"MT\" unambiguously identifiable in this way? There are those who would answer for you, indeed are all-too-eager to do so-precisely those who are blasted by the content of what appears here and are expecting the general inertia to account for you as well--expecting the public to settle for cheap innuendo and personal sour grapes for having received proper Rebuff to improper efforts at appropriating and twisting a true teaching for their personal aggrandizement. There are those who are counting on the public to accept their prepackaged and self-sening \"yes\" to the above significant question, to accept it thoughtlessly in the manner they have popularized without the slightest consideration of the character, quality and content of the material you've received since the Bird first swept within sighting distance. It's easy to accept the dismissal of \"ego\", when the aggravated trend of the general inertia tends to pull you fiom the effort required to properly assess the value of something which insists there's more important work to be done than arguing the dubious merits of \"personality\", and so serves you a banquet-+ banquet perhaps bewildering in the depth and spread of the Table prepared under advisement of the critical time but lovingly fixed nonetheless, to accustom toward practice of properly chewing, digesting and assimilating the full form of real spiritual nourishment. Of course this proposition isn't the easy equivalent of wolfing \"known\" commodities, so reassuring in the cliche-familiarity of their flavors that no special attention need be paid. Furtive detractors of"},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV this teaching count as always on the reactive mind, most ready to consume takeout caricatures illustrating the educated range of their own palates ... How then is all this spirit, this teaching, this tidal communication (happy to surprise a puzzleddelighted public month to month with a kind of presentation in style, substance and sheer volume curiously unrerniniscent of anything, unborrowed, incomparable to the point of startling the drowsy eye of the seeker to near wakening by itself) able to be stuffed into the dimensions of ego? Even our fd detractors who must attack by disguise and innuendo seem unable to depict the force of this presentation as anything but wholly beyond the dimensions of the ego-personality; thus they're obliged to depict this presentation as a monstrous Disproportion to the tiny scale that really represents the caricature of themselves as the craven ego-being--only by projection purporting to depict the vulnerable ego-subject \"who-would-be-king\" taken over by a Power vastly beyond him, as though he must be a mere channeler! Does all this neatly fold up into the usual, convenient categories? Or has the intuited unity, the persistent coherence threading art to article and issue to issue been detectable (before identification of any alleged single author) as a tidal force, an energy of expressive diversity and purposive intensity that can't be distilled to a single theme, a single summary note or object but which ranges high and low, informing every topic at whatever level with the illuminative Key that belongs to no single person, which isn't the possession of anyone but which only expresses thus fkely and comprehensively where there functions a productive presence that lives and abides by that non-exclusivity of Being? Has there not been, in the manifesting presence of the T-Bird's sweeping wingspan, the distinct intimation of Intelligent Energy first of all, pouring forward in the abundance of unprece- dented demonstration taking protean form before the One background Identity (which is not the equivalent of any single, self-same personal identity) shifting like a will-of-the-wisp while leaving the lingering sign of a persistent Presence appearing through the playful puzzle of every \"signature\", the symbol-clues encoded in occasional glyphs and pictures? (There are those who may have noticed, for instance, that the pseudonyms aren't entirely arbitrary; they furnish anyone inclined toward the pleasure of mind-problems some \"noshing\" diversion; and of course the rest for whom it is not to their taste can leave these little rebuses that pop up with each column ... For example \"Morra Talion\", writer of the Power Breath articles, expresses in his name the very object of the series, i.e. that of bringing back the balance to the Crown or summary \"head center\", for \"Morra\" is the Spanish root of crown and \"Talion\" means \"to rectify\" or revenge, that is, to restore balance ... Okay, so not everyone is going to want to take advantage of the little intellectual pleasures that are variously encoded about the T-Bird pages-but having heard this we bet there's hardly anyone who doesn't at least look, out of the secret comer of the eye, whenever an \"MT\" moniker is next encountered.) Those indeed who first of all perceive the presence of a diversely manifesting, magically unific and palpably multidimensional Energy-intelligence expressing through these pages, who intuit the ceaseless working of an Awakened service-function which can never be rightfully ascribed to or limited by the conception of a single servant, have grasped what the Bird is all about. They've understood without perhaps even noticing, or needing to notice, that the ''same initials\" undersign every article; for the showcasing of any particular personality was never the point!"},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV What A Thunderbird Does When the format for the T-Bird was first conceived (a genesis which took all of an instant), central to the consideration even then was precisely the question: how may people learn to identify the being of an authentic teaching-presence of the higher stages? and immediately the answer was clear; rather than show forth a particular person, rather than spotlight an embodied Source and surround that source with claims of an authenticity requiring a certain minimum good faith at the outset (to the effect that such claim proceeded neither from an effort at public deception or fiom self-delusion), rather than put the improper foot forward at the beginning which almost automatically compels that an equation be made between an \"authentic teaching presence\" and the assertions surrounding a particular personality, it was understood on the instant such a presence should be demonstrated in practice--allowing the natural functions of the public antenna the native wisdom to pick me signals from the false without ovemding static proceeding fiom the intimidation of magnified personality-publicity. It was recognized at the very beginning that the point needed to be made in a wholly unique, and uniquely asropriate, way, i.e. as a gentle exhibit in practical terms of what such a wisdom and such an energy is. Whether it proceeded from \"one\" or from \"many\" was not the point except insofar as it inferentially demonstrated a went of what any one being, any \"single personality\" may do alone when the Centers are truly opened and harmoniously integrated with the Whole; the real point has always been to show what the inner order of our Reality actually is, to characterize, describe and give the practical keys of that Reality in such a way that the common sigmficance of every apparently disparate zone of knowledge becomes increasingly clear, the puzzles and conmdictory signals from various sources--of diverse perspective, energy-composition and ultimate purpose that have so confused and bewildered a seeking dimension of souls-become progressively coherent, mutually illumining and accessible to a single comprehension (admittedly, with a little reciprocal effort on the part of the public! another aspect of the demonstration of what an authentic teaching must be in order to be honored as such, for any real teaching at any level of its expression will require the active participation and engaged curiosity of the \"seeker-public\" ...) While We're On This Subject Though we were naive enough to think we'd thoroughly covered the subject of our \"variable degree of difficulty\" (and the opportunity it presents the reader on all occasions to resolve simple with complex truths, the spiritual and the scientific etc. hm many--mutually illumining- angles and approaches) we will here exhibit one other of the holy qualities by demonstrating the patience of a Saint and addressing those who may still lament, in codiontation with the \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness'?\" series, for example, that the \"simplicity of Jesus's parables was what made his teaching so accessible to the common man\". We'll always take the time with those who mean well, since they always seem not to notice the obvious bait in a title such as \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness'?\"! Can one honestly believe the T-Bird didn't know that people's salivary-glands would approach such a title with all the conditioned expectation of teaspoon feedings, and recoil in shock at the actual tone and character of the text? can anyone honestly suppose we didn't give such conditioned consciousness this particular Bird in all deliberateness as an affront to the unrecognized lassitude of mind that such Biblical homilies have encouraged as a de facto standard of \"spiritual communication\"? 709"},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The truth is, Jesus was addressing a mass-average which couldn't push its collective I.Q. into the 100's column; those homilies (or something like them) were all that could be communicated at the time, and even by internal Biblical evidence they were not plums of successful communication at all-\"simple\" as they were, they were utterly mystifying to the mass consciousness of the time, \"Christ\" was universally misunderstood ... and then he was crucified! Have a nice day. The condescension behind the concept of the \"common man\" actually presupposes everyone is still stuck, at the \"year one\" mark, with the mean mentality of a troglodyte. So \"simple\" were those communications in any case, that Holy Wars have been fought over their meaning, newborn churches have fragmented fiom their parent source in contention over the sense of such \"simple\" content, and to this day there are interdenominational logomachies fought over just what \"Christ\" meant, with hardly a concession to the obvious fact that \"Jesus's parables and sayings\" are more the assemblage of \"all King James' horses and all King James' men\" working fiom unsatisfactory remnants and redactions of basically secondary source-texts (themselves penned by disciples and discipled-rumors of questionable accuracy) than they are reliable expressions of what the personality \"Jesus\" intended to communicate. In the case of the T-Bird, we are obviously presented with a situation of twentieth century consciousness, functioning fiom various levels (none of which can profit by easily-digestible bite-size sayings casually passed right through the mental cloaca without real transformative engagement) in a critical situation of wholesale planetary and psychic t~ansition requiring a universal upgrading and integration of knowledge, understanding and practical means compatible with the metaphysical and scientific orientation of the specific era. Those who may not realize that times, needs and requirements have changed over a millenium should consult the old Alice Bailey text, A Treatise On Cosmic Fire, where it's explicitly stated that \"Christ and the Hierarchy\" are now-+ the latter part of the 20th century--aiming the communication of adepts in the direction of philosophical disclosure and teaching, a strengthening of the epistemological foundations of \"science\", an awakening of dispassionate metaphysical analysis in the general public etc. This mandate hasn't changed. It is only now in the process of being fulfilled. It only stands to reason that it requires different energy, different methods, different tools. And never forget--not everything in the T-Bird displays that highest degree of \"dfi- culty\" for the general public. The easiest and most accessible ongoing feature is also the one which significantly proffers the most direct potential for real spiritual and mindhody transformation, i.e. the Charger Breath series. Yet when we ask whether those protesting the tone or timbre of a particular feature have begun to take routine, practical advanrage of that feature which is easiest and most accessible of all--as well as being a potent transformative tool uniquely available to the public for free-we're generally greeted with a nonplussed silence! AAA: Heart Of The Thunderbird Those, then, who fist perceived in the T-Bird pages the presence of such a multidimen- sional, variously-expressed and often playfully stated Teaching-energy having a reciprocal good time with a public caught off gwd in the midst of a stalled \"New Age\", actually noticed the important point about the appearance of our winged Messenger, i-e. that it was the unique expression of a real Awakening Energy and purpose appropriate to the Time; without perhaps overtly knowing it, they'd succeeded in identifying the Manifestation of the illumined Mother Principle! Note our monthly masthead, \"The Mother\": AAA."},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The awakening principle and mesting power that expresses itself on the arching back of the colossal T-Birdthrough the functional persona of \"MY each month is not then even a \"male\" agency! So much for the \"single person\" theory. The Mother Principle, the nurturing force of cosmic wisdom/illurnination as it applies to the specific awakening and Transformation of Gaia, our \"earth\" the mother-planet, is exactly the force and Agency being expressed and liberally dispensed here month to month. The expression of that illuminating principle through these pages indeed announces the presence of the awakened Mother-current, accomplished in the living Person of AAA. And now we may know a little better how the true awakening principle functions through its authorized agents in the world. AAA, the efficient source and awakened presence of the Mother-teaching, has herself no visible or public hction; she does all initiation work in seclusion. She has a handful of personal students, works through them as representations and typal embodiments of the present statelcondi- tion of humanity, and perfom all public work through her extemal representative and awakened emissary \"MT\". Whatever the public receives, whatever the public comes to know of its own initiating Mother-currenf will in the foreseeable future be known through MT. If this inevitable and necessary focus upon a \"personal\" agency awakens the disquietude of those for whom the hasty accusations of \"egoity\" yet echo in the mind, it should be remembered that the wise have always said: You can tell the presence of the Real when it finally comes, amidst all the other se, it's the only one for which the accusers are already waiting as if to bbcrush it under foot\" the moment it makes its appearance, \"like a Scorpion\". This recited order of things (AAA working inwardly upon the world without public contact and MT working outwardly with the world as the accessible agent of the Mother Teaching) is not the result or expression of any personal determination. It expresses the Decision of Cosmic Process, and has nothing to do with the way \"male or female egos\" decide to handle things. The Determination as to the Way in which this initiating Process is to be presented, has occurred with the impersonal organic simplicity-as well as the inevitability-of cell-division in a growing embryo."},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV What then, as our reader this month has providentially asked, is the bottom line in determining the legitimacy and positive presence of -a teacher or teaching? A Bar Of \"Channel\" Soap We know for instance that in the case of channeling, the issue of answerability is a real phantasm of shifting mirrors and light shows; for when we go to apply the leads and finger-cuffs to measure galvanic response on the lie-detector we're told that the present physical party isn't the actual source-party responsible for the information, and so can't be held accountable; this present physical party, the actual channeler, only functions as conduit, as thepipe of an Information which doesn't represent hidher own knowledge or experience but which purports instead to issue fiom a Realm directly integrated with a Knowable Truth, that is however not the directly available ground of the channeler; and when we go to inquire as to Who the responsible party is upon whom we may place the electric leads, we're told such Party is invisible and unavailable for testing. The One Who \"Holds Still\" When however we turn, in our restless seesawing, back to the classic alternative, we're presented with the prospect of one whose expression is not the ventriloquist transmission of a distant source distinct fiom the visible personality; we're presented with the prospect of one whose being is necessarily the expression of a direct, unmediated integration with a Knowable Truth. In other words, by inescapable implication we're now confronting the proposition of a living/embodied personality manifestly sharing the same plane as ourselves and directly attesting the Magnitude of reality channeled sources claim by indirect means through agency of the channeler! We're confronted with the prospective equal of a higher-dimensional being embodied directly and existing shared terms of flesh-focused humanity as a whole. In this sense, then, we may feel we've isolated a responsible Source, one directly answerable to whatever teaching and power issues from \"his\" presence--one on whom, in other words, we may apply the measuring electrodes of the EEG meter. Don't Put Descartes Before Da Horse At this point however, we are conventionally stopped--especially by those who've purported to represent this higher-dimensional Condition to humanity--and told we're attempting to apply objectivist criteria that don't satisfactorily \"cross-over\" in application to essentially spiritual subjects. We're told that our desire to have bottom-line, tangible objective proof is an improper demand relative to the delicate/elusive reality of \"spirit\". We're told that spiritual value or the presence of authentic spiritual magnitude is not rightly measurable; it is not quantifiable, and does not loan itself to the monitor of gross-physical instruments. This allegation, while having its points, if carried to the ultimate logic of its implication results in the same problematic dualism the insightful Princess found embedded in Descartes' final distinction between the \"ghost-in-the-machine\" and the \"machine\" (or body) itself. If there is no bridge, how does one (spirit) act upon, in or through the other (the manifest \"body\")?"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"If we observe that what we \"read\" on a graph, monitor, gauge or meter isn't one-to-one equivalent of the value such agencies phenomenally express, we've paid every adequate respect to the \"disparity\" existing between forms of quantifiable measurement and the total phenomenon or cognitive whole. There's no need to carry the proposition to the internally-contradictory extreme of alleging some unbridgeable disparity or dissimilarity between an epiphenomenon and the value of which it's inevitably an expression. There is no absolute disjunction between the two, and the phenomenological or even epistemological reasons why this is so are part of the educational effort to which the T-Bird continuously dedicates itself, so as to help clear the ground once-and-for-all of the objectivist debris of several centuries (that has in itself helped set the detrimental philosophical supports now manifesting as the notorious/psychotic estrangements between consciousness and the field of its manifestable pattems-see for example this month's Cheers and Jeers section on malathion and related topics). Your Right To Objective Proof Is Ontological, Not Moral Or Legal This should indeed be great good news for those who've asked the question of verification in relation to claims of a \"higher-dimensional knowing\", and who have longed for the simplicity of an objective gauge. Despite protests that such a desire is \"reductionist\", it is no more so than the alternate and even hazier notion that such a thing can only be evaluated by one's own \"subjective\" assessment (as was suggested in a New Age magazine article), for example whether the \"teacher\" in question gives you a \"good feeling\" or \"bad feeling\", whether you can \"sense\" something in his \"presence\" etc. (after all, isn't this precisely the claim and testament of those who followed Jim Jones and Bakker et al. down the primrose path? one might just as well propose the negative criterion as being that of +one named \"Jim\"). The Subject/Object Amphibian: The Saktipat Man Similar criteria on a slightly more sophisticated or escalatedly \"esoteric\" level have been proposed, determinants hovering mid-way between the \"subjective\" and \"objective\"-for example the ability to perform saktipat, i.e. the energy-transmission of the socalled kundalini force through laying on of hands, the proverbial magnetic glance producing primarily \"inner\" or non-shared effects as by materialization of subtle vision at the Third Eye etc.; or the often related criterion of the production of \"miracles\", i.e. shared supernormal effects that transpire in the charged vicinity of the teacher. J.C. Pearce in his book \"Bond Of Power\" has indeed stated the case for such a criterion by proclaiming that the truly \"enlightened teacher\", while rare enough, is not nearly so special as the enlightened one who is fully illuminated to the degree of possessing the power of guru-hipa or saktzpat (speaking as he was, of course, about the late Swami Muktananda). However, Mr. Pearce has it exactly backward: while the enlightened teacher is rare, the teacher capable of demonstrating Sakti-transmission is not necessarily enlightened! While the two values may occur in accompani- ment they do not necessarily, as Mr. Pearce's declaration indeed suggests; but it is not that the presence of the latter depends upon having first fulfilled the conditions of the former. We can have (and surely have had recent) public examples of those who are manifestly capable of demonstrating a type of \"saktipat\" or energy-transmission, producing quasi-miraculous"},{"pageNumber":729,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV or supernormal effects etc. (even discounting the ''Amazing Randi\" factor), and who prove to be as manifestly manipulative, self-serving and unenlightened as the t.v. evangelist who allegedly only takes in the \"most gullible\". Elementary, My Dear Watts The reason for this is known to awakened or initiated interpretation (as opposed to the effusive conjectures and testimonies of fledgling \"initiates\" such as Mr. Pearce); in a certain sense, upon reflection we ought to be confident such disclosure as this present one does proceed fiom a source of Awakened interpretation, since it's hardly self-serving of someone continuously capable of manifesting powers of energy-transmission to point out, strictly for the seeker's benefit, that such powers are by no means the bottom line, and in themselves are possessed to varying degrees by some few who certainly have no right to the titles of \"enlightenment\" they nonetheless are quick to claim. For indeed, initiated interpretation tells you quite plainly that the ''gift of saktipat\", subtle energy-transmission or even the induction of \"miraculous\" effects is no criterion for identifying an enlightened source. The powers of supernormal show or of saktipat-transmission are not the exclusive product of the Awakened Being, but are in themselves the effect of a certain type of elemental activity organized through threshold ratios of attunement and alignment of the \"chakra centers\"; and these minimum patterns of the operative centers through which such elemental powers work, are as much a peculiarity of the energy-predqmsition of the personality configured through quite unenlightened psychological patterns as they may be of any other single factor. Idiosyncratic relations of the nested subtleldense bodies and corresponding energy-ratios of the centers reflecting purely psychological factors drawn from childhood modes, may furnish background states ripe for the \"opportunism\" of various elemental powers functioning fiom many possible levels (other than fiom the organizational numen of the Awakened level). Such elemental powers are, in themselves, notorious for their \"play\". Their playfill business is to ignite inner sensory energy-patterns, to provoke attracting or distractive sensations etc. Their novelty and excitatory effect (an effect they specifically seek to produce, as they live on the energy of excitation elicited fiom the psychological subject) tends to obscure the groundfloor truth that they're just more \"phenomena\" albeit of a comparatively extraordinary type. Indeed if we were in possession of instruments capable of the appropriate kind of objective measurement, we'd find that those who \"channel\" and certain of those-hdeed most of those-who appear able fiom time to time to manifest \"miracles\" or sakipat-transmission, share a certain minimal energyconfiguration in common. We would find, if we had a \"chakra-registering machine\", that the channeler who (usually) claims no enlightenment on hidher own behalf but only that he/she transmits the viewpoint of a Higher Consciousness, as well as those who demonstrate sakti-transmission while claiming enlightenment on their own behalf, equally exhibit a minimal (and usually exclusive) energy-intensification or high heat radiation at the chakra site of lower abdomedperineum, and the location at the back of the neck just below the base of the brain. Such a chakra-registering device attached to \"channeler\" or \"sakti-transmitter\" would not need to (and in most cases wouldn 't) register anything in terms of extraordinary \"output\" at any but those two polar locations. (Those who want to understand more about the significance and esoteric importance of the basal-abdominal and medullary locations should refer to our September issue of the T-Bird and the Qabala of Star Wars article especially, as well as our October-November"},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"two-issue essay Channeling, UFOs and the PositiveRfegative Realms Beyond This World.) Suffice to say in order for a \"channeling\" or \"saktipat\" condition to be established, the electrification and minimal activation of these polar-autonomic locales is all that's required; in the majority of cases there would be insignificant-to-no amplified output registered at the sites of the Third Eye or Hearr centers etc. Now, amazing and most gratifying to relate, there are available means of registering objectively the approximate conditions of the chakra sites and energy meridians! Lo and behold there is now, and has been for years, adequate means to exactly fulfill the longed-for criterion of objective verification with respect to the real awakening and activation of an illuminated system. There is a quctntztable way to \"show the actual work\" that has or hasn't contributed to an activated/harmonious awakening of the patterning processes which must minimally accompany and represent the presence of an Enlightened personality-expression. In fact we generally knmv of the existence of these quantifying agencies; we've been familiar with them for the most part, at least through the literature, for years! It's just that we haven't focused on them, we haven't been steadily subject to an awareness-intensification that might cause some metanoic click in the common brain making known to the general consciousness the perfectly adequate presence of the technical means. While we've pined away in our private longing at the same time being told there is \"no such thing\", while we've brooded over the seemingly \"impossible\" possibility of a swift, economic and minimally accurate means of making known to ourselves whether we stand in the presence of fool, fraud or genuine Friend, we have sulked in the very midst of the growing technological capability that would bring our seemingly fruitless brooding into the ripe realm of the Possible! How indeed do you suppose the recent rash of New Age \"brain-tuners\", \"digital audiolvisual integration devices\" etc. (see MindIBrain Behaviors, this issue) managed to calculate the precise correspondences in signal frequency-amplitude, exact program mixtures of wave ratios and interactive patterns productive of altered states, reveries and meditative conditions? The demonstrable effectiveness of at least certain of the better devices was obtained by decades-long research in measuring the signal outpuf dielectric potential, physiological response patterns and biochemical modifications as recorded through extensive sampling of meditating subjects through- out the world including very many designated \"yogis\", \"saints\", \"zen masters.\" etc. First of all of course, the objective data obtained clearly and forever refutes the shallow \"Amazing RandiW-style thesis that nothing abnormal or unusual occurs in the case of healings, energy-transmissions, yogic performances etc. The accumulated biofeedback data etc., already and forever refutes the monotonously reiterated lie that these are all manifestations of perceptual trickery. There should be no question, no \"debate\" any longer at all as to whether such things exist; the only legitimate question that remains in the case of healers, psychics, yogis, zen adepts etc. is whether they exist in any given case-which is an entirely different question. Oh Oh,,, And this brings us to the ultimate consideration of this essay: for it has indeed been determined there are \"minimally\" refined brain-patterns indicating the presence of extraordinq conscious states-whatever else that's involved in such states that can't be objectively measured, there is at least an irreducible quantified component that must be present in any legitimate case of \"extraordinary\" mindstates or awakened magnitudes of consciousness. (For example, in the decades"},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of study it was found that, of the experimental subjects and meditative volunteers all that could be grouped into the more advanced stages of practice manifested a strong if variable mixture of Beta/Alpha/Theta patterns with stress on the extraordinary Theta or deep-creative dreamwave; and of all those sampled and tested over so long a pakstakhg stretch of time only one, Swami Saraswati of Delhi, seemed capable of exhibiting a sustained deepalpha pattern even when out of meditation, during the whole course of his day while walking and lecturing. This data is indeed an indication of the different and hierarchic stages of enlightenment development, to be described and explained in detail in the T-Bird pages most especially--at present-& the ongoing essay-series \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness'?') Hen ~t Comes.. . More than this4ere is the cwent availability of devices, patented machines and instruments testably able to register harmonic ratios of certain quantifiable energy-components through the so-called \"chakra\" systems correlated with endocrine centers, autonomic plexuses and the ki meridians or acupuncture channels etc.--most notably the Motoyama device endorsed by the American Nurses Association and AM., and incorporated in standard clinical use! Though little known, the credibility extended such device by orthodox \"legitimacy-conferring\" agencies ought to make the general public more sanguine that a real potential for determining \"occult\" stages is available, and at least theoretically at the disposal of those who've longed for some objective means of measurement in so crucial an area as \"Enlightenment\". Indeed it had occmed at one time to MT that, were there not so strong a potential for eliciting accusations of \"egoism\" in such a gesture, it might be very helpful to the public to be given some such objective demonsfration as is possible with the range of legitimate and clinically acceptable devices made available over the past decade; if there were not so strong a probability of being opened to the misperception of \"self-serving\" or \"personal aggrandizement\", MT had thought to offer himself as a subject of test measurement in order to establish a public Standard. Were there not so predictable a chance of the whole offer being interpretively deflected over to the miasmal arena of \"personality\" (which is just what the presentation of the T-Bird had calculated to undercut), MT had considered offering a public forum where those who claimed enlightenment or the \"right\" to teach the higher stages of awakening as represented in Sufism and Zen, \"Ati Yoga\" et al. could sacrificially submit themselves right along with MT, up on the platform with the \"Motoyama chakra machine\" and professionally-monitored EEG equipment in a comparative analysis of the energy output and respective harmonics of the centers, ki-meridians etc. In this way, MT had at one time mused, the public could be given its long-coveted \"objective demonstration\" and indeed the public could then claim the right to request that anyone purporting a teaching andlor presence of the Higher Stages of consciousness-illumination submit him~herself to the minimal standard of objective measurement! A MODEST PROPOSAL Of course, upon considering this veritable Modest Proposal, MT realized that the possible misinterpretation of \"egoism\" was sure right away to be exploited by those hoping desperately to avert the sudden specter of an objective glare directed squarely in scrutiny of their"},{"pageNumber":732,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV own fi-eely-dispensed claims of \"enlightenment\" or \"higher knowledge\". He realized it would be all-too-easy to dismiss so unique a challenge chanted by aroused public uptake, with any stock disclaimer: \"I wouldn't stoop to such public displays of egoism\", \"anyone who does such a thing is only trying to draw attention to himself' etc. - Of course, the predictable disclaimers of such \"egoless\" and \"non-aggrandizing\" souls might possibly be greeted by the public hearing such demurral, with the unexpected recognition that it could just as well be interpreted as a gesture of genuine humility and openness simply to submit to such an objective test! to be led like a lamb up to the sacrificial pla$oxm on behalf of a public tired by decades of the time-and-energy-wasting, trial-and-error probes conducted through an insufficiently educated psyche all by itself in the dark--up to the platfbn right there alongside old MT to be put to the only fair test of \"sitting, walking and talking\" into the impartial objective registry of the Motoyama and EEG needles! Yes, if MT wasn't wary such a proposition might play into the hands of those all-too- willing to throw up the smokescreen of \"ego-accusation\" and \"personality-cult\" in order to squirm out of finally having to put up or shut up in their pretensions toward \"panditism\" and \"god-intoxi- cation\", he would have made the Modest Proposal long ago. Of course, were the public to understand and rightly appreciate that accusations of ego issuing fiom those threatened by such challenge were already accounted for and countered by confession how anyone genuinely having the public's time, energy and well-being at heart would not avoid presenting himself as personal sacrifice for such a test (and in fact should be eager to do so) the public submission of such a proposal would reside in true Good Faith in the public keeping. Were the public to understand and rightly appreciate that one so willing to hazard the misinterpre- tation of egoism and self-aggrandizement accompanying any such unprecedented proposal was easily then willing to suffer the one thing any pretender to enlightenment must necessarily dread (i.e., being perceived as an \"ego\", you know), that very public might realize the demurrals of those rejecting or scorning such a challenge were already filly anticipated and cut o#at the exits in advance. Were the public to understand and realize this, of course, rhen we would have quite a show on the New Age fiont! Then the picture would of a sudden intriguingly change, as it were, overnight! Then perhaps MT would not be bashful, or intimidated by the criterion of false humility still foisted on an unsure public, to put forward in the public arena his Modest Proposal (i-e. as he is doing now). Bring Up The Cranes, Bring On The Trucks... Of course there's still the practicdmechanical consideration of actually obtaining and assembling all the necessary measuring devices; there's still the tactical and monetary problem of acquiring them, even shipping and hading them (the Motoyama device is, for example, relatively hard to obtain as there are not many models made altogether); however, there is on the other hand the intrinsic appeal such a spectacle, such a modem-day Roman circus might impress upon the entrepreneurial consciousness in consideration of the wholesale public attention aroused. There's the possibility that those having the where-with-al, the capital or inside access to the right machines might just find the whole proposition a profitable prospect in one way or another; the intrinsic drama-of-it-all as the murmurs spread and rumors circulated of such a peculiarly novel solution to the perennial public stumper regarding quaIifications for Enlightenment etc., might just pique the"},{"pageNumber":733,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV imagination or entrepreneurial spirit of a Whole Life \"Paul Andrews\", for example, to put up the traditional old angelic front-money for the staging of such a peculiarly nonviolent \"fight\". After all, if nothing else the sudden vulnerability and potential for personal mayhem of such a redoubtable \"MT\" as Mike Tyson, forsooth, must certainly prime the palate of a pacifistic bloodlust amongst those who'd like to see so self-trumpeting a fellow as your ancient fiend Michael take it squarely on the chin-chh So what do you say, all New-and-Space Agers, shall we get it on? Who shall we get in the hotseat next to MT? (Whoever it might end up being, he or she had better watch it, for we hear MT has a tricky pingala-current and loping, upper-lobe cross!) Oh yes, in the meantime, well before this ever does or doesn't materialize as some semi-final sideshow of the Apocalypse, allow MT the privilege of disclosing to you the ultimate (rather than the sideshow penultimate) criterion for discerning the real presence of awakened consciousness, the genuine appearance of your Friend (or as our reader has expressed it, the \"bottom line\" for determining the \"mystic teacher\"); your true £iiend and Avalon emissary would always let you in on the little secret (though he does not need to, considering his advance knowledge of the objective outcome of any such proposed test) that even the evident presence of optimal theta-wave patterns under all test conditions, the registration of maximally amplified and harmonious chakra centers, acupuncture meridians et al. is not a sufficient standard for the determination of the presence of Enlightenment; rather, such print-out really represents the minimal threshold of objectively-meas- urablepattem balance that must be obtained and exhibited as steadily present in order for any given personality even to be considered as candidate for Enlightenment. What such measurement gives us, then, is really the criterion for summarily dismissing any who don't meet it, thus performing a judicious process of weeding and so paring down the time, narrowing the territory that need be traversed in order to close in on the highest probability of the real thing. How then do we determine edightenment itseIfamongst the (very very few) remaining \"candidates\"? Here the reciprocal requirement of the seeker's development is called upon. For beyond that minimal threshold point of objective measurement there is no way to tell other than through the seeker's own maturity, his or her developed insight and wisdom (and that can only be acquired after long apprenticeship with whatever personality \"qualifies\" under the first criterion!). Sorry, but that's the way it is; since Enlightenment is unutterably afiee realization, it is not equivalent even to any optimized energy-patterns (this is where the \"wisdom\" of the conven- tional Krishnamurthism comes in); on the other hand, no enlightenment can take its point of departure in Free Flight fiom any plateau of pattern-alignment below the stable minimum threshold (and that is where the conventional Krishnamurtbism goes out the window). Enlightenment is not dependent on an optimal energy-pattern in the sense of any one-to-one identity or exact equation; yet Enlightenment gives rise by implication of Its Value to an optimum energy-pattem, which must be established before any realization of that Value may be considered possible. Thus there is a stable plateau of currents, ratios and alignments that must be met, and which is capable of being exhibited; beyond that, the personality may cling to ego rather than release ego to its Void-ground, yet because it prosecutes this furtive clinging in so exceptional and enriched a mindbody atmosphere its \"trick\" is impossible to perceive fiom ground level-which is, let's face it, the point fiom which the seeker proceeds. This is why it takes much work and prolonged practice for the seeker to dktect, fiom a"},{"pageNumber":734,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV more elevated plane, the probable persistence of the contractile ego in any given case--or, conversely, the truly Awakened character of his teacher's total Being that has presided fkom the beginning over his own awakening process, and is therefore really capable of leading him the final Step to Free Flight. The only thing that can be said for this \"predicament\" still confronting the seeker even in the face of the comparative biofeedback printouts, is that such minimum objective requirement at least reveals a source having the practical multidimensional energy-means to draw the seeker parallel such threshold status itself-whether having the fkee Insight-Consciousness to take him any further or not. Aside from all this, the question may well remain in the mind of the reader: What is the necessity of resorting to an \"embodied\" teacher at all, regardless how he or she \"registers\", especially considering this-perhaps-disconcerting news that we can't determine the Enlightened status of the one in question with any degree of accuracy regardless, till the (indeterminate) time we get high enough along the \"peaks\" of polarization to have established personal systems of sufficient balance to survey with clearer Vision? What is wrong with simply resorting to \"channeled\" infomation, for instance, learning fkom such disembodied--and therefore indifferent (?)-instruction how to perform \"our own\" transformative practice without the questionmark that seems to hover over any agency sharing the same vulnerable embodiment as ourselves? The Channeled No-Nos, Or How To Tell A Channeled Hellion Apart from the obvious inbuilt limitations we've addressed before (i.e. you still can't how the degree of development of a \"disembodied\" source just because it transmits fkom elsewhere) there is the more significant fact which every positiveAegitimate channel-source will readily admit: due to such disembodied status, in which the communicating Entity doesn't share the same plane and therefore the same set of conditions under which you must meet your responsibility, there are definite restrictions on what such a source can impart in the way of information or guidance. Positive Entities abiding by a uniform cosmic law cannot--and declare furthermore they will not--give specific techniques of meditation which, inferentially, could induce opening and realignment of the personality's energy-currents, centers etc.; they will neither discuss nor divulge information re any physically-embodied being, any currently \"incarnate personality\" except in terms of general principles applicable to the situation of the earth-plane subject making the inquiry (this because of the undue \"influence\" collecting around their disembodied and thus \"privileged\" status which might interfere with the subject's ;6ree will decisions). And indeed, these are two criteria for assessing whether one has opened communication with a \"positive\" or \"negative\" entity to begin with, the Negative force being perfectly willing to discuss--and calumniate!-presently living personalities especially those known by the public- and being willing as well to give specific \"meditative\" instruction (cf. the \"Hilarion\" discussion in the November issue of The New Thunderbird Chronicle, \"UFOs, Channeling ...\" etc. Part 11). This leads us to the question why such Entities may not impart meditative instruction of a specific type relating to energization and alignment of the centers (and, inferentially, why it's inappropriate for unqualified \"teachers\" sharing this physical plane to do so either, merely because they've come into possession of a little information or knowledge they wish to pass on for profit)."},{"pageNumber":735,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The disembodied source is restricted by Law not to do so, since even if It is a perfectly awakenedlenlightened source in Itself it still doesn't embody the full vertical range of systems and centers inclusive of the vital-physical properly aligned and harmonized; Its tandem \"ride\" upon the channeler's yet-unperfected chakra complexes and lower energy-cments isn't adequate, doesn't make up for the disembodied deficiency and in fact gives the extradimensional entity a defective \"torso\" awkwardly inappropriate for direct resonance-engagement of the vital processes of the subject potentially requesting the meditative \"technique\". And such complete, vertically-full resonance/engagement through wholly wakened and harmonized centers, fiom the zone \"above the head\" to the chakras of sacrum and feet, is the true responsible requirement of any \"one\" (whether embodied or disembodied) minimally demanded by cosmic law as a condition for righ$ully \"prescribing meditations\" implicitly able to provoke an awakening in the requesting subject's sy-. As we've seen, the \"disembodied\" source, constitutionally without any but a borrowed torso not at all equivalent to Its own higher-dimensional harmonics, is vetoed by the requirement. So then obviously is any teacher, even embodied and so sharing the same plane of destinylrespon- sibility as ourselves, who hasn't undergone that transfonnative process in the Awakening and stable alignment of the spiritual current-pattern. The seriousness of potentially unlocking/reordering the multidimensional current-systems of the requesting subject, contains a responsibility to which the non-transformed \"teacher\" is in no way equal. Such a teacher is the equivalent of a random irresponsible b'provider\" of objective information-knowledge only, apparently similar or identical to the \"mautram\" instruction (etc.) of a truly awakened teacher but4eceptively beyond the perception of the requesting subject-+ no way charged with the energy-potency of the true Teacher which alone imbues formal instruction with the safeguard of harmoniously integrating energy c~f~ents, officii'y-awakened alignment, funzishing potent/balanced resonance a#unement right along with the Keys given out to the student-seeker. In the case of the real Teacher alone, qualified by Transformation and not by possession of information-knowledge, the student-seeker is initiated--literally initiated through resonance- coupling and alignment with optimum values of the spiritual source-current, adjusted, harmonized and fully embodied right through connective vital tenninafs of the mind/body system shared in common between the equally-incarnate companion poles of student and Teacher. Tbis is the real and central significance of an embodiedfawakened Teacher. As you can see, then, every form of \"teaching\", embodied or disembodied, has its place (even if it's in the alley); and you can see as well why the embodied form of aficlZy awakened Teaching remains indispensable, owing to that which it alone adequately provides by the very nature of things. The living teacher is never p&; the walking-talking Teacher sharing your plane of manifestation and particular, responsible destiny as companionhiend is never outdated, displaced by machine or the self-assumption of impatient egos presuming to exalt themselves beyond their blind condition through a pact of mutual admiration and promotional encouragement.

(Watch for dates of future initiation-projects displayed on our back page.) Beginning this issue Initiates' Cor- ner becomes a semi-regular column, first of all so that those presently unable to take the ongoing classes available to initiates are nonetheless fur- nished a continuous touchstone for their prac- tice. Those benefiting from initiate's work whether right here with us or not, will have recourse to this column wherein the most fre- quent experiences, phenomena, questions and considerations re the practice may be addressed and explored. At the same time, those currently benefiting i?om ongoing personal instruction in a class context may have a \"scrapbook\" of the more significant features of practice to conserve as handy table of reference. This is especially helpful since the possible transformations, events and phenomena that inevitably take place with practice don't take place at the same time, in the same way or with equal consistency for all students; variability in the patterns of development reflecting personal characteristics may make the content of a given column immediately applicable for one, while usable by another only somewhere \"down the line\". For either, it's convenient to have a permanent counsel available on the subject to which necessity can resort whenever it need to or will. Early Possible Phenomena: Exterior Bright or dark dots saturating the field of vision. This may happen most frequently after formal practice. The effect varies considerably according to time of day, weather conditions (dry Santa Ana or electriclpre-storm etc.), state of overall mindfbody functioning and the available lightsource or background toward which vision is directed. These are effects you may remember having faintly perceived at different times before; the phenomenon can become so pronounced however due to formal practice that it tends to revive impressions of the \"early\" visual field, before adolescent conditioning and mature focal alignments displaced such fascinating ground to the unlit rim of perception. Indeed the effect is most pronounced if you're gazing out a window at dusk having a view of the sky and horizon, allowing your vision to go slightly out of focus. At first this saturate field of exploding, pulsing, swimming dots may be confused with or seem to be the same as the microorganisms magnified to visibility on the conjunctiva of the eye; gazing steadily through their \"bowl\", however, it becomes apparent they seem to occupy a mid-way zone between objective and subjective agitation of the visual field. They display \"density\" as well as surface, and don't respond"},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV so strictly to ocular shifts as do the familiar phenomena of microorganisms that tend to glide obliquely with a blink of the eye. The more one settles one's attention into them, (as opposed to trying to focus them--a futile effort) the more vivid and repetitively explosive they become. They may take on the appearance of throbbing or bursting energy globules. This may be accompanied by a sensation of \"sensuous\" energy, or effect of flashing light like bluedot bulbs behind the upper eyeballs or forehead. It is a generally pleasurable sensation, and may last a variable length of time (almost entirely dependent on one's absorption in the phenomenon, since the phenomenon never \"inter- feres\" with normative focus. One may restore regular ocular alignment at will; the phenomenon automatically fades into sublimity and dissolves shortly after, unnoticed). The phenomenon is a superficy of etheric vision; its incident function (apart fiom fascination) is \"tip-off' to a general shift or subtle side-slipping in the coordinates of attention gently produced by process of the initiatory life current; the effect is that of (phasically) recessing the projective plane of focus, proportionately settling the psyche into closer congruence with the threshold of its deeper being4us \"immersing\" it in states and fields just preceding ordinary discharge of phenomena into physical visibility. With specializedpractice, subjects have learned to \"use\" this threshold field as a medium for the steadying of attention to prolonged equivalency with alternative coordinates thereby eliciting luminous shapes, fiotational light-foms and quasi-organic \"blobs\" of radiant electricity behaving at variance with mechanical radiation patterns; and displaying apliability or plastic responsiveness to the willed exercise of imaginative concentration that can, with application, \"lead\" to other things ... Such possibilities are, themselves, outside the initiate's immediate practice. They're mentioned here for the sake of general knowledge, to help get student \"bearings\" with respect to other disciplines and paths that may have been heard of, read about or formerly attempted. The specific practices given SC students are contextually appropriate, constitute a sufficient discipline without recourse to anything else and indeed should not be admixed with adventuresome \"spelunk- ing\" into other media owing to the okn unexpectedly-combustible combination of incompatible elements. As was thoroughly explained during the initiation process, the initiatory induction and accompanying methodology comprises in itself the most complete and efficient means of overall harmonious development in the shortest amount of time compatible with one 's unique inbuilt life 3-purpose. The process, left to its own devices, is an organic flowering without adventitious growth or distractively superfluous accretion. Early Possible Phenomena: Interior The brilliant often colored lights and patterns experienced during the initiation process and accessible according to the keys of practice, correspond to electro-etheric pathways that are continuously activated by the current energy. As was explained, they have a physical-electric component; but they aren't accounted as strictly electric or physiochemical phenomena First and most obvious to initiates of course, is that their observed behaviors don't conform to exclusively mechanical interpretation. They display, particularly during longer lengths of practice, a remarkably organic and synergic character. They tend to be concentrative rather than dissipative, and obediently respond in conformal alignment with the flow of attention. The reason"},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV for their divergence from strictly physical characterization, has to do with the fact that our \"scientific\" description of electricity is not complete. We possess a description of electromagnetism based on its exteriorized behavior already £&red through and discharged by a multidimensional patterning network. What is formally observed is only partial or stylized expression of that network. There are etheric dimensions of light-energy (having nothing to do with the outdated scientific notion of a mechanical ether, the winds of which were allegedly silenced by the Michelson-Morley interferometers) through which the physically detectable \"cross-section\" is formally filtered so as to focus, as well as objectively feed, the Sunlit Flower. Therefore it's most likely we'd cross such \"hidden\" dimensions of the radiant field where the processes of its complex nature-coding intersect the pJychic network of symbolically-charged geometries as which all vital pattems and physical perceptions are organized. Where else would that be, but in the practical Athanor of the initiate's Work! In geneml then, the colors and lights that appear through the locus of attention correspond to whole values, and are indicative of the dominant ratio or presiding balance of forces processing the life-pattern at the moment of observation. This obviously means--and accounts for the factat the more concentrated and prolonged the stream of attention, the deeper the change in tone of both light and correlative color-values usually developing in the direction of stability, brightness, rich specific glow and more symmetric (or geometrically-simplified) pattern tending toward purely mandalic or circular form. This also implies, and accounts for the fact, that prolonged concentration shifts the spectrum of light-values upward toward the \"ultra-violet\" range (if the observable hues don't already begin there in any given case); since the inwardly perceived lights and correlative color- displays index the operative ratio or net balance of forces interacting throughout the system, directing an energized stream of attention to the regulatory \"junction box\" of those processes is equal to ensuring progressive dominance of the most comprehensive/internally balanced or \"com- plete\" values of life-energy. This becomes dutifully reflected through observable internal \"settling\" of patterns and hues to a stable, coherent quality organizing over the most \"holistic\" (whole, complete/circular) attributes. Though in any given case, at any given time, it's possible to perceive the most stable and lustrous lights or patterning fields immediately upon assumption of formal practice, the usual progression of practice can be generalized as moving fkom an initial \"dimness\" or inner vagary of admixed colors, complex laminae of gliding checkerboards, fuzzy pinwheels or interbleeding grids toward increasingly purlescent concentrates, brilliant homogenized discs or electrified dots. The movement (over the time-interval of formal concentration) proceeds also fkom more mechanical impressions to the more organic and psychically sensitive; at a specific depth of concentration the forms and colors are lustrously alive like organelles, and dancingly turn before the inner field like phosphorescent infusoria. This coherently organizational process underscores initiated interaction with a synergic (negentropic, etheric) Mework of reality, and stands as concentrative adjunct or formal consoli- dator of mind toward ingress of the Awakened Eye. Thus all such patterns and lights, whether colored or bright white, serve specflcally for the initiate as bullseye focus through the Rings of Spiritual development and Whole regeneration, smoothly converging the inner field of vision upon the critical Sun at Midnight."},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV RED LIGHTS4ominance of or work through vital-excretory/eliminative centers; ruby red, with polyhedral grids or lattice-planes, indicates etheric-causal level (threshold to \"astral\" level); ORANGE LIGHTS4ominance of or work through sexual and ego-organizing processes; YELLOW LIGHTS--lemon yellow or dim yellow lights, dominance of or work through solar plexudpower centers; lustrous amber or bright yellow lights, pertains to mind and a specific intellectual value of the discriminative or \"buddhic\" center; GREEN LIGHTS4ominance of or work through the emotional mid-brain and heart center as psychically-responsivehonding fields; values of \"empathy\" etc.; BLUE LIGHTS--dominance of or work through throat center, higher verbal and speech faculties as expression of \"yogic\" or eing spiritual values, audible sound- current as \"mystic\" void-energy field; PURPLE LIGHTS4ominance of or work through third eye center, unificationlcoherent integration of processes as a spiritual whole value, direct insight, intuition, will; LILAC LIGHTS40minance of or work through refined spiritual value, metacosmic wisdom, superconscious regulation of processing currents, linkages with multidimensional Person- hood or Higher Self.

I suspect that the energy of Initiation (last night) had something to do with this but as far as my conscious mind is concerned I am not aware of the connection. Nonetheless, it hurts, as this group and teacher has been my real family for about eight months. h4) ,@ormer] teacher is a direct disciple of Ramana Maharshi and he is a Jnani and there is no question (in my mind) that he is truly transcendent--but I now know that I can never accept a teaching that focuses solely on identification with ourselves as pure being without taking into consideration that this pure being is expressing itselfas an evolving consciousness through htnnan form and personality. As deeply as I care for my teacher, it's not enough to see enlightenment as just awakened consciousness expressing itselfspontaneously. A human being is an individualized divine spark which doesn't lose its individuality j--Iust its separateness, and it eventually expands into a state of superconsciousness. It doesn't become a nothing at the moment of enlightenment and it's not enough to just ask ?Vho Am I, if it means denying our feelings as an evolving human being. -Sincerely, J. B. MT's Reply: Dear J. B., Such sometimes apparently \"painful\" separations take place when the soul is suddenly awakened to a deeper dimension of its Being, and no, the conscious mind would not necessarily have been aware of having made any such decision for \"x reasons\". It must be noted that some clear contrast within your Being has taken place to allow you to decide for so emphatic an action despite the potential pain involved, even though no personal agency has influenced any such seemingly radical shift. What has precipi- tously \"propelled\" you to make so decisive a move, of a sponta- neity and immediacy that obviously surprises even you, has to do with the very order in which real awakening must necessarily take place. The Inquiry \"Who Am I?\", to which you've become accustomed in your practice with the above-mentioned \"Jnani\", is given through such agencies as (ideally) a means of linking the ordinary--and ordinarily preoccupied --thinking mind with the spontaneous Inquiry of Conscious- ness that takes place implicitly, all the time, through every aspect and instrumental agency of your Being. Every breath, perception, thought, action, feeling or state of mind is an implicit means by which the Whole Being inquires continuously after its ultimate Reality, constantly asks through the camouflage business of its \"familiarizing\" faculties what its own real nature and condition might possibly be. Yet the formal, verbal mind-inquiry given to the student by the Jnani in the hopes of eventually linking him to the present truth of continuous unpremeditated Soul-questioning, is no more compelling in itself than any other function of the thinking mind; it carries no more decisive weight in itself than the question \"what's for lunch?\" or \"what shall we do now?\". And no amount"},{"pageNumber":742,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of mental repetition, mnemonic reinforcement or formal thought-practice on the part of the student is going to give that verbal phraseology any more privileged a status with respect to the implicit Self-inquiry of the total Being than it already shares with every other superficial expression of thought. Placing the inquiry at the level of thought at the outset never leads to a deeper installation of the \"Soul-recognition\" soughf nor to any deeper or greater spirimalquickening past the threshold of continuous mindchatter (amidst which the phrase \"Who Am I?\" forever rattles). Why then does it seem that some \"Jnanis\" (some would name \"Ramana Maharshi\", some would name \"Krishnamurthi\" etc.) do awaken to such Soul-realization, do indeed seem to be \"Iransmdent\" as you put it? Indeed, taking just the case of Krishnamurthi as example, we mustn't ignore the history behind his eventual brand of espousal; we mustn't take too lightly the fact that the Theosophist Leadbetter discovered the young Krishnamurthi (through the former's celebrated \"aura reading faculty\") to possess already, as found, the most \"perfect\" aura he'd ever seen. It was, by his description, very stably sattwic or yogically balanced--and this, remember, to begin with. This always suggests the presence of a relatively rare being whose \"soul record\" is already largely balanced through sufficiency of real energy-work in \"former\" incarnations etc. He is, virtually, trembling already on the brink of a \"higher realization\". All too typically, however, the methodology by which that transformation is brought about serves to smother potential recognition in the awakened psyche of the preliminary develop- mental stages through which all beings must procedurally progress. In the case of Krishurthi, his reaction to the Theosophical pressure to emerge at the end of the process as World Teacher, caused him to short-circuit the very real Process that had been begun in him. The character of this swift termination inevitably stamped the character and quality of his teaching work; consequently, what emerged as clear, self-conscious recognition of the inquiry of Being to which he could then address even the verbal or thinking-mind, became the exclusive showpiece of his teaching. It was recommended as sufficient-in-itself at the very outset, to a wholeplanet of consciousness that would thenceforth be in the dark re the preliminary mind-body alignments and repolarizations required to achieve just the threshold of balanced stability needed before any such Inquiry could be placed at the verbal or thought-level (without becoming hopelessly a part of the general mind-chatter of random contents). The \"awakening\" of such a jnani himself, while apparently transcend- is necessarily partial; it is, as you've intuited in your letter, a half-realization which at best clears out the thinking mind, and makes its thought-structure lucidly reoriented about the basic Questionmark of Being. Thus the \"answer\" the jnanin elicits in response to that habituated thought-form, tums upon the mental process of inquiry itself and so settles on the subject-self; the presence-to-itself of the Mind-mirror. The real emptiness of this subjective self-presence through which all contents of inquiry are reflected, becomes the apotheosis of enlightenment. The \"camouflaged\" activity of the faculties-according to this \"enlightening\" orientation--are superfluous, no longer hold any meaning or fascination and so tend to become much like the bridge which, once crossed, is burned. This accounts for the jnani's apparent fastidious dissociation from or minimization of the instru- mental coordinates of the whole Being. Indeed he tends to become f~ed, immobile or kept to a stingy economy of activity (e.g. as in the case of Ramana Maharshi) since all faculties and expressive agencies are assigned a superfluous value with respect to the stillness of Mind. They tend to become very functionally subordinated to that empty stillness which \"answers\" to the general Inquiry of"},{"pageNumber":743,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Being. Indeed the persuasive impression emitted by the authentic jnani is that of one who quietly awaits the superfluous presence of the body and thinking-mind to drop off, to be finally \"shed\" in death. It's fiom such personalities that we obtain our \"Eastern\" idea of Enlightenment as a cessation, a final termination of all development, of engagement or exteriorizing expression etc. in an ultimate detachment and cold dissociation fiom the creative processes of life. But, as we've seen, the jnanin point-of-departure always targets the thinking mind (firmly structured already about the unifying hypothesis of the \"subject-self\") as the uniquely suitable vehicle through which to \"realize\" the overall-inquiry of Being. Thus, once the thinking mind settles on the Term of its resolution, (i-e. the emptiness of its own activity as a Questionmark gnawing through endless contents that model the self-nature on a contingent basis) it cultivates satisfaction in simply contemplating that Tern, as if it could be sufficient in the exclusivity of its apprehended \"state\". The ''transcendence\" we see in the jnani's face is his holding to this emptiness; though he often teaches precisely \"letting go\" or even excising the phenomenal (as \"Guru Bawa Muhai- yaddeen\"), he himself is clutching to the emptiness of subjectivity in such a way that all the faculties and functions necessarily expressing or formally communicating in, through and a that state are critically devalued. Indeed, they are expected to languish; and where (as with Guru Muhaiyaddeen) they're not actually looked upon as a cancer, they're nonetheless viewed as agencies of potential disturbance without keys of reconciliation toward that state of Mindlmirror-emptiness at all! Thus the jnani \"beams\" the \"transcendence\" of Empty-mind just exactly in the manner of (or as if positively modelled after) the moveless statuary of the Buddhically enlightened, upon the fiozen exterior of which dust indifferently settles. Yet when he turns around to give this valued point-of-departure in Mental Inquiry to the student, he mysteriously fails to produce even this partial effect. Rather than having handed the student a means of becoming satrvic or balanced, he has handed him another content on which his thought processes can gnaw in common distraction with all other contents. He's handed him another \"thing\" to think about, which in its verbal phraseology bears no privileged relation at all to the spontaneous Questionmark configured by the activity of the whole Being. Unless there's first an awakening of the implicit presence-to-itself of consciousness as the spontaneous interrogation of Being into its own nature through all representative instruments, agencies and faculties, the formal Question: \"Who Am I?\" has no special impact on the reality of the subject-self. Indeed, it simply becomes an artifice through which the subject, continuously changing like Proteus into every impression carried on the stream of thought, can nonetheless mentally convince himself he's getting somewhere, prying loose some special insight into the subject-constant of those changing predicates presuming to fit formal features in provisional answer to the empty Interrogative. The awakening of Being to direct recognition of itself as spontaneous, implicit Inquiry into its own very nature, however, makes of the \"Who Am I?\" a much more central and primary apprehension of Consciousness than it could ever hope to be in merely verbal or conceptual form. The \"verbalization\" of Who Am I? in this case does not define the limit of dependency upon which the Soul must hope to hang its chances of a Conscious Insight. The border of recognition does not abruptly stop with the fitful disappearance fiom mind of the formal concept. From this angle of entrance, there is no procedural \"retirement\" into an empty or enforcedly \"blank\" Self-sense; rather the spontaneous void-character of the whole Being becomes"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV progressively intensified, stabilized as the Self-referent of Conscious Inqujr and finally serves to inform the faculties and functions directly. Thus those instruments aren't asked to be significantly diminished in their activity but on the contrary become creatively vivified, mutually awakened to a unific function in Consciousness so as to be able wholly to serve, express, communicate, transmit and further quicken (to the degree of awakening) that liberative Void-value through the responsive faculties of others. In this way creative activity isn't thwarted, nor are the expressive instrumentalities of Being artificially shut off like a water faucet; indeed the creative force of Being becomes magnified, ballooned in unlimited extension and projection like the \"powder of projection and limitless multiplication\" imputed to the alchemists' Philosopher's Stone. In the wholly Awakened personality the faculties, functions and forces of the expressive pattern no longer serve to supply the camouflage content of ostensible formal \"answers\" to the Question-of-Being; rather those instrumental agencies use, form, organize and act through all such contents as direct expression, communication and celebration of the unitive Void-nature of Being so as to function in the spontaneity of Consciousness Itselftoward the magnification and Limitless Projection of truly Enlightened Influence.

What relation does it have to standard \"religion\"? Are their themes and goals the same, similar or dissimilar? All initiates should know that real Spiritual Initiation does not engage any process which is incompatible with \"religion\" in the @?ITWTE6' coL%II!R highest sense of that term. Indeed, correctly understood, true Spiritual Initiation furnishesthe means of finally fulfilling the object of religion in its most universal form. When we consider the \"religions\", whether Buddhism or Christianity, Muslimism or Hinduism we recognize their common de- nominator in the fact that-whatever their diver- gences of content--they comprise first of all systems of ideas (i.e. precepts, regulations, doc- trines, codes, laws, beliefs, concepts to be \"sub- with Michael scribed to\" as faiths etc.). Such systems are meant to be means of unifying the given social order about a common set of principles. Religion appeals to principles which by definition are \"highest\", i.e. those purporting to be based on spiritual and thus ultimate dicta. On the negative side, of course, this tends to be a special plea for \"ultimates\" which impose an absolute-unchallengeable authority; the untestable (and thus formally mediated) character of such dicta is established by the fact that \"religion\" identifies its signs of spiritual sanctification only up to the degree of formulated idea. It cherishes the indirect or verbally transmitted nature of its authority. It's for this reason however we may identify \"religion\" in general as the Rule of social organization, since its precepts are meant to be followed automatically as articles of faith rather than as premises for independent exploration. Something taken on faith, as unimpeachable idea, may produce immediate behavioral uniformity without having to be personally \"verified\" or individually confirmed. Thus the object of religion is a noble and viable one, i.e. to furnish a common set of principles setting sufficiently comprehensive pattern for behaviors as to establish the minimum social harmony necessary for unified functioning. At the same time, however, the external imposition of authority which religion achieves (etymologically, religion means \"to bind\"), serves to lock the collectivity into the system of automatic response-patterns representing a generally low level of mindhody integral adaptation. Chronically functioning--on the whole-from such a weak level of mindbody integration, the given system is subject to a proportionately high degree offiiction. The enforced suppression of personal development in terms of the scarcely suspected codes and (languishing) potential built into magazines of the mind/body pattern is reflected to the surface as vague dissatisfaction, unfocused resentment, projection of internal deficiency upon \"external\" causes and a chronic tension, a subliminal edginess due to the continuous pressure of imbalance. Since the very mode by which maximum social harmony is assayed at the same time answers as source of that tension and external friction continuously undermining its own aim, religion in itself tends to aggravate the conditions apparently recommending its progressively authoritarian control. Thus the worthy object of religion is unattainable on its own-traditional--terms. Why is this so? Why should this be so when-for example--the study of comparative"},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV religion shows there indeed exists a universality amongst spiritual ideas, a c~ous concord of certain recurring themes across disconnected lengths of space and time unmerited as mere efforts of rational interpretation etc.? Doesn't the evidence suggest there's a deep basis for religion's greatest ideals decisively beyond the needs of a given social order, justifying expectation of a more positive and productive outcome than has so far been achieved? The basic agreements of the most diversified spiritual traditions stem from the unignor- able fact that each major religion has had its origin in a Realization, i.e. the actual Awakened testimony and authentic teaching of a being brought alive to some significant degree in the underlying Truth of existence. The convergence toward unity of expression is therefore the result of a deep awakening to the basic Unity-of-being. The very persistence and manifest magnification exhibited by the greater religions throughout history, testifies to the measure of persuasive verity released by--and carried upon4e founding inspirational force; it doesn't affirm the measure of lingering \"validity\" that may attach to the corrupted carry-over of the Initiating power in the form of those interpretive codes ultimately coming to comprise the institutional eidolon, the Temple of social ceremony. The founding Realization hm which any religion derives its conceptual strength, was produced through a transformation. Transformation of the mindhdy totality, drawing it significantly closer in congruence with its optimum integral potential, is a function of Spiritual technology. Confronting the prospect of \"religion\" and the historical limit of religion, we find the missing Key to be that of the actual spiritual technology or transformative means through which the Living Cornerstone of the churchly edifice was first cut and set. This indeed is the \"stone that the Builders rejected\". Such technology belongs to the inbuilt midbody potential with which all selfconscious beiigs are endowed; therefore its apparent \"loss\" or mysterious eclipse with respect to that part of \"spiritual truth\" officiated by the inevitable priests of the sacred language, can't be attributed to its having been physically misplaced like some codebook or mechanical artifice. It isn't the possible \"crystal\" or high-tech device (associated with some supercivilization colonized hm space) that accounts for the occasional upsurge of real spiritual insight or first-person revelation in the midst of collective darkness. The real \"codebook\" is the complex of centers and systems common to the human form, in which the essential data is already entered; the only \"device\" that's necessary, is the axis through which the self-reflective psyche already functions. Since such means is always so close to hand, it isn't surprising to perceive the parallel propagation of that stream of spiritual technology coursing continuously, overtly or covertly as the case may be, alongside the official current of religious history. In the East that coexistence tends to be open, if classified; next to the Brahmin, there is the yogi with his breath and asana. In the West it tends to be hidden and even suppressed, so that rumors of a \"Rosicrucian college\", secrets in symbols of the Masonic Lodge perturb the priestly slumber like strangely-familiar shadows crawling across the tabernacle. The historical discrepancy in the degree to which the traditions of \"spiritual technology\" might be integrated with belief patterns of the social order, manifestly dissolves--in any case-when the cementing doctrine of every such order loses the security of its hemispheric parochialism and the respective b'technologies\" themselves are fieed, in the upshot, fiom the interpretive restraints in which they were traditionally enclosed. Such an auspicious circumstance certainly serves to supply a potentially new lease on life to spiritual technologies now theoretically separated from encrustations of doctrine (the"},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV distortive filters of mass interpretation meant to consolidate a social authority) and released to the surface of a general awareness having a correspondingly greater degree of freedom available to it. Presently reintroduced, not as experiential supplement to \"spiritual theory\" but as means of directly renewing Spiritual Truth through the expression of Living-unmediated-Awareness, the revised forms of spiritual technology may take their place with respect to the general order of things in a way never allowed before; unique to this present time, they may be made accessible on the larger scale so as to furnish the long-withheld means of practically realizing the highest social precepts previously posted as paper billet beneath church arches. It suddenly becomes time to understand that there is no sound way of realizing the ideal degrees of tolerance, mutual respect, forbearance and courteous accommodation requiredif anyone adequately abiding by the articles of \"faith\", except insofar as those articles are brought to life as natural expression of a transformed pattern-of-being--a wholly renewed, integrated and spiritually msrmif~ed Form for which the progressively available modes of alert relaxation and gentle clarity-of-Being provide a suitably functional means of modifying behaviors according to the most beneficial standards of love and service. All spiritual initiates of Southern Crown should first understand, therefore, that the extremes of well-being, intensities of bliss and calm, spans of solid concentration and centered awareness to which they may attest are there to be valued not only for themselves but as the progressively consolidated vehicles of a more perfect life-service, permitting easy realization of just those \"religious\" ideals that seemed so subject to the fi-ailties of \"human nature\"."},{"pageNumber":750,"pageContent":"Were Those Quakes Fakes?

MT EDITORIAL The readership will no doubt recall last month's T-Bird coverstory/editorial \"The Quake Is A Fake! \", which put forward the mild proposition that there was a good probability California- and most immediately the L.A. area-was to be targeted for a series of artricial earthquakes. In answer to the antiphonal exclamation \"What is an artificial earthquake?\" it was suggested that a secret technology presently exists whereby the (tacit) world power structure and its military enforcement ann-barely surfacing to mass attention through the regulatory media as cryptic utterances re \"The New World Order\" and in geopolitical soaps of a \"Second Russian Revolu- tion\"+ould pull off prodigies of power previously assumed to be the exclusive province of Nature ... and that there were those who'd been giving Cassandra-like intimations of this fact for a very long time, those who understood these matters very well and even had common intercourse with the egos and elements involved on a \"first person basis\". The specific cues compounding current reasons to assume this disquieting potential, were then cited to show how diverse evidences tended to point to the self-same thing: there was first of all the testimony of higher-dimensional awareness, to the effect that Southern Crown adepts MT and AAA had experienced long-standing sensitivity to the interaction of natural and artificial forces, even globally; that, owing to initiated mindfbody alignment congruent with optimum coded potentials of the extended biosphere, the intrusion of an artificial potential in the harmonics of such patterns past a certain faint level was inevitably felt Any furtive kindling of such potential within that field above threshold values necessarily disturbed overall, organic balances in the nature-cur- rent--sacrificing global integrities of Gaia to local amplifications and forced disproportions of a peculiarly \"distorted\" viewpoint the invisible presence of which registered a contrastive stress in the adepts' systems. Such disturbance was intercepted anywhere in the organic circuitry, through consonantly attuned systems. Cut now fiom the testimony of initiated awareness (only verifiable through \"personal duplication\" in any case, an invitation that's always cordially extended), and consider the scientific anomalies surrounding a recent tectonic disturbance identified by that initiatic source, at the time, as induced or artificial: the so-called \"San Francisco quake\" of '89, preceded by a massive undersea radio signal which seismic analysts, using state-of-the-art em models, unequivocally associated with the Lorna Prieta temblor-yet which confounded those very analysts at the same time giving them their most difficult data since the expected em signature was unaccompanied by the \"obligatory\" plate disturbances such waves purportedly announce. By simply flipping past those pages containing the text that keeps conventional science blindered, and turning to equations of the \"non-ordinary\" science (helpfully propagated and preserved in parallel over the decades following Tesla's proofs re extensive bioengineering of the global em fields), we come to find how easily the \"anomalous\" data fits into identifiable profiles-"},{"pageNumber":752,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV how in fact such equations convert what was \"in;esolvable\" in one context, to elements of sheer inevitability fitting so smoothly into the shifted context they confrm its general view. At the same time, by familiarizing ourselves in review of this available body of scientific (if officially \"unac- cepted\") research--often propagated by the very advance-guard personnel working sensitive positions, in government and industry, at the helm of leading-edge technology-we may become the more swiftly reconciled with the intelligence (staggering to the unprepared) as to how \"unthink- able\" feats of geomagnetic engineering are accomplished and even tailored to refined specifications of targeting and scale. Once the full implication of the experimentally accessible \"etheryy and subtleties of \"phaseconjugation\" are absorbed, those apocalyptic potentials with which the scientific arm of the world power elite has long been familiar will permit an ease of understanding as to how certain imperious \"predictions\", associated with our third piece of evidence, may be so coddently advanced. Matrona-From-Sedona If one knew, for instance, that one had within one's immediate power the means by which massive earthquakes, thunderstorms, squalls and cyclones could be generated to a high degree of specification, there would be little hesitancy or modest equivocation in stepping up to the parimutuel window and declaring the outcome of every scheduled event; thus the anonymous source of the hortatory pamphlet circulated from a dissemination-desk in Sedona, familiar amongst New Agers in the last months and quoted for relevant predictions in the previous T-Bird issue, exhibited no compunction in giving exact dates and places for upcoming cataclysms of the \"Cayce\" scale. With peremptory certitude this faceless source, identifjhg itself through no human agency and most peculiarly failing to associate itself with the common ego-capital contained in syllables of the channeler 's own highlight Name, merely declared itself a spirit-guide transmission of Mother Earth Herself, messenger of the terrestrial Logos (no less) fixing to make herself \"more round\", you see, and therefore giving fair warning that she intended to rearrange the adipose flesh under her girdle by smoothing out a few rough portions of California real estate, lacing-up procedurally so as to displace the bulbous belly of the ground fkom North to South as far as Washington in the process incidentally generating cellulite rolls across her undulant Navel to operatic magnitudes between 7-and-12 \"on the Richter\", shedding a few billion inhabitants like so many calories along the way. Judging, then, fkom the stentorian confidence of the predictions, it would seem that this particular \"Ma-Logos\" might well be on intimate tern with the shadow-government engineers who stage such occasional events-fiom their installations and underground outposts strategically distributed across subtle grid-lines of the globe--as tune-up for just some Gotterdammerung as this. Having drawn the several threads of evidence together and announced this very thing as conclusion, the MT editorial of last month brought up a multitude of immediate questions which it then essayed, in part, to answer. First of all, of course, why would such a genocidal act be triggered by servitors of the \"shadow-government\", those minions of the tacit power-structure, simply because the capacity to do so might rest in their hands?"},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Secondly, given a \"good\" reason, wouldn't such a thorough pulverization of everything indiscriminately as is generally associated with large-scale quakes, constitute an unacceptable sacrifice of enormously elaborate, critical and costly military/industrial installations etc.?

In this context, a few rationales immediately lurch forward ... Desirable decrease of surplus populations; the decimation of an intransigent territorial bastion of hangover, '60s spiritual frontierism in the form of unacceptably high energy California-vortex acreage; the \"proving\" of both Psychic and Scientific predictive media on behalf of their respective audiences, so as to render the remaining populace more tractable to anticipatory engineering and large-scale, \"evacuation\"- style redistributions both of peoples and properties; the general excitation of \"crisis consciousness\" to be adroitly orchestrated for any number of pressure-adjustments in the desired direction including wholesale willingness to step aboard the armada of suddenly-materialized \"rescue-beamships\" at the climax of some salvational pseudo-rapture: any and all of these things immediately recommend themselves as potential emoluments to redound to the account of the power-structure, in the wake of one or more successful \"predictions\" with respect to long-pending catastrophic scenarios. And there are more; these are just prima facie, but there's actually much more involved which we'll discuss along the way. In order to understand all that's actually invblved, however, it will be productive first of all to inquire into the fate of those predictions (or more properly, what so far has become of them) as set forward in the anonymous Coming Earth Changes printout. The Catastrophic California Quake, September 8, '91- Or, Return To Your Nostradamus Readers, Please The first date of the Coming Earth Changes predictions, specified Redlands5.A. as the recipient of an 8.7 on September 8. The next designated date targeted Los Angeles for September 10. Does everyone remember the devastating Red1anddL.A. quake of September 8,1991? Do we recall the great Los Angeles cataclysm of September 1 O? No, not along this particular probability- stream do we draw on the memory-record of such events! Nor, up to the present date of this writing (October 12, 1991) is there any intermediate date to which we can point, specified or not in the jeremiad of Coming Earth Changes, that bears the mark of prophetic fulfillment upon any of the target zones in question. Just what has happened so far, then? And can any of the meantime occurrences, situated anywhere around the globe, show significant relationship to the predicted events? If there are no such occurrences capable of showing connection to the anonymous oracles, we may only assume such circulars were borne on the breeze of a malicious but empty bombast. If, on the other hand, we can show such connection, several implications immediately emerge. First of all, there was a minor disturbance at Lake Arrowhead, 2.7 magnitude, around the first specified dates which however was not substantially greater than the ordinary, virtually- continuous vibration characterizing local tectonic pattern that draw no special attention in their common course. There was a temblor in New Zealand, exactly on the first specified date (September 8) of either 5.8 or 6.5 magnitude depending on the system of interpretation-whether issued fiom New Zealand or drawn off the graph-paper of Caltech. Interestingly, on 8/24/91, the lead story for the 1 1 :00 p.m. edition of Eyewitness News, KABC-TV, featured a San Jose electronics expert, Jack Coles; the remarkable thing about this is"},{"pageNumber":755,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV that, for a lead story, it belonged much less to the category of news than to the timeslot for editorial opinion--or the arena of fortunetelling. Coles was featured specifically, it seems, because he was making dark predictions for a massive Bay Area quake, of the projected magnitude of 7.0 or above, to occur on or very near September I 1 --almost three weeks following his predictive appearance! This circumstance was interesting then for three reasons: the unusual nature of a \"lead story\" that was singularly bereft of news content but high on the alarmist scale; the fact that his September 11 prediction was one day off of the September 10th designation of the anonymous Sedona source; and that Mr. Coles was confident to make such prediction despite the relatively long-range projection involved, since the most \"certain\" state-of-the-art forecasts based on rela- tively new em modes of the seismic science had so far been able to demonstrate impressive predictive accuracy only within a range of a few days. Yet Coles, himself declaredly basing his prodigious record of 22 successful quake-predictions (of \"major magnitude\" over the past two year period) on spectrum analysis of radio waves, noise distortion, ghost signals and em patterns seemed sanguine to proclaim the extreme probability of an event comparatively remote and subject still to an extraordinary number of intervening variables. Indeed he qualified his rermks only a little by declaring that he would lcnow with even greater certainty one or two days after Labor Day (i.e. two days prior to the date of his actual September 1 1 prediction). So great appeared the official confidence in his predictive track-record that, as the Paul Dandridge-voiceover proclaimed, the S.J. seismologist was being subsidized and furnished equipment by both IBM and Hewlett-Packard. In following up the train of this particular predictive sequence, we may first observe that, in the San Jose area itself in a span of days around the Labor Day weekend there occurred peculiar barometric fluxes and unseasonal weather-patterns precipitating abrupt, dry thunderstom punctu- ated by enatic sheet-lightning bursts. The report of a San Jose resident (related to a Southern Crown student/staE-member)' indicated a peculiar subjective \"mood\" associated with this abdve weather, and noted as well that the birds and animals of the region seemed particularly disturbed- his dog being so frightened even when there was no actual storm, that it hid under the bed and wouldn't come out This is cited as significant since there did indeed take place a sizable quake, not equal to but proportional with the predicted scale, on precisely September 1 1 in the San Jose area Now, the behavior of birds and animals preceding natural quakes, is that of an uncommon quiescence; the creatures go peculiarly, even ominously silent in the days or hours before a true organic temblor or seismic upheaval from Ma-nature's bosom. On the other hand, the type of \"phase conjugate\" quake induced from artificial potentials as was registered by the attuned mindlbody being of Initiated consciousness was also consistently accompanied by the aberative response-patterns of creatures both domestic and wild, demonstrably upset by an intrusive vibratory quality. Add to this the fact that both AAA and MT had specifically announced to students several days prior to the first September date, that artificial current-potentials were \"turned on\" at some point or points around the globe (the inverse-square of distance being no factor in relation to scalar properties), and the potent character of the days' surrounding circumstances is secured. It should also be noted that around the same cluster of significant dates there were local barometric and weather disturbances, in the San DiegoLos Angeles areas, resulting in similar anemic showerbursts accompanied by flashes of horizon-spanning sheet lightning-+ well as kettledrum rumbles of protracted \"thunder\" that seemed to roll up out of the Earth itself."},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV We need merely turn to our Bearden hymnals on alternative energies and scalar \"vacuum-engineering\", to be assured that the smeptitious buildup of \"scalar em potentials\" when correlated and \"interfered\" in a particular manner results in the very atmospheric pops cited last month as bracketing the June 28th L.A. quake and attributed-without official corroboration--to sound-barrier phenomena..but which, when discharged in an alternative manner issues as a low extensive rumble like thunderfi.am the center of the Earth. Jumpin' Jack's Flash-In-The-PAN Indeed there occurred the \"predicted\" quake in the San Jose area on September 1 1, of a lesser magnitude than forecast either by the Sedona Ma-Logos or the more modestly designated Mr. Coles. When the above-cited SC student~staB member actually called Mr. Coles to find out what his further forecasts might be, she managed to reach old Jack himself! just as she had immediately after Labor Day, when he'd held firm to his September 11 prediction--and now, straight-fiom-the-horse's-mouth she received the assurance that the September 11 quake, though of a lesser magnitude, would necessarily be followed in the succeeding days by shocks of the predicted magnitude; so certain did Mr. Coles seem in regard to all this that he declared his intention of spiriting himself and family to a place of mountain safety immediately on hanging up! However, the succeeding days proved instead that the September 11 quake of 5.1 magnitude established the ceiling for the series, the following rumbles (as forecast by Jack) progressively diminishing and dissipating the sum force that might have been assembled for one mighty push across the seam of the San Andreas. What, then, does all of this amount to? There does seem to be a more than statistical coincidence with the first of the predicted \"Earth Changes\" dates; however in the first case the expected temblor occumzd My around the world from its stipulated target of L.A., venting a comparatively great magnitude but without injury or substantial damage in a remote outback of New Zealand; and in the second case the temblor struck in the generally \"correct\" vicinity, but lost its enthusiasm before it could come near the winning numbers. After that, the \"effort\" seems to have dissipated altogether, and nothing vaguely approaching the remainder of the projected dates (up to this time) has come to pass. At this point, we assert there's a way to perceive the phenomena of these first two quakes coinciding with predicted dates so as to show both the presence of an engineering intent (which after all was the original hypothesis of our article) and to satisfy possible questions as to why the Southern Crown adepts and T-Bird parents didn't discreetly withdraw in the face of a \"threat\" they manifestly took seriously-zmbedded in that clarification, then, resides the implicit intelligence as to what may be marshaled in response to so apparently overwhelming a capability. The happenstance to which we draw the reader's attention in the first instance, is the hidden fact that the zone ofblew Zealand squarely occupies a significant position on what are known as earth's energy grid-lines. Indeed it's situated on a node which, as we'll see, is a harmonic reciprocal of the grid-node over which the San DiegoLos Angeles area is poised. Fryin' On The Grid-AL First of all, just what are these energy grid-lines? They're manifestly not the same as the cartographer's coordinates which may be viewed as abstract geometric conventions. We do find"},{"pageNumber":757,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV however that a substantial research has been done and a substantial literature already pub- lished which tends to corroborate the perennial .teaching of the Wisdom science on the very same subject. Significantly, the existence and importance of such energy-grid harmonics was first stimulated to modern scientific notice by the manifest conformance of UFOjligh~paths and appearances throughout the globe, to con- sistent if invisible trace-lanes. Such principal investigators as Bruce L. Cathie came to deter- mine over a period of time that there was indeed a curious network of zones, trajectories and points exhibiting repeatable patterns and a kind of consistent harmony of numerical relations distributed like a dense webwork over the globe. Cathie in particular discovered there was a harmonic correspondence to the metric measures of these coordinates, and that within the Wework of such subtle harmonic the invisible grid seemed to encode a specific unification amongst values of mass, the electromagnetic field, the speed of light, the harmonic table of temperature and gravity itself. He established these correspondences through controversial resort to an ancient measurement which, for the academic mind, was purely arbitrary, the convenient confection of the old mathematicians: i.e. the values of degrees and minutes of arc, minutes per grid second, and grid-hours where one minute of arc corresponds to a nautical mile on the Earth's surface. (Grid hours calculate a single revolution of the Earth in 27 rather than 24 periods, which ultimately accounts for Cathie's 144 speed-of-light harmonic.) By expressing grid-measurements in arc values the harmonics of the fundamental forces could be mapped as a geodesic, in equation with the geodetic inch--the geodetic inch is 1/72,000 of a minute of arc, so that one minute of arc is equal to 6,000 geodetic feet. Logarithmic, trigonometric and radian values also fit harmonically with the geometric patterns. - Cathie demonstrates that these values aren't arbitmy. For example he found that by applying 112 cycle value of the 144 light harmonic (72) to a particular ~yth&orean triangle the units of which recur as values in the grid-pattem, and by extending each side of the triangle in the ratio of those unit-values the resultant figure yields sides of 2 16,288 and 360 units; these correspond harmonically to fundamental properties of the Euclidean circle and the velocity of light, linking them in a geometric equation where 216 is the harmonic representation of 216,000, the number of minutes of arc in a circle; 360 corresponds to the 360 degrees of a circle; and 288 corresponds to 2C (C = the speed of light harmonic), i.e. (144 x 2) = 2C. The number series in Cathie's grid harmonics must be viewed as amphibians between calculus and Qabala, where a perfectly elastic \"sliding ring\" may zip across the digits displacing decimal points (so that, for example, numbers exhibiting the identical series but punctuated by differing decimal places are harmonically equated, i.e. 1.694443 and 1694443); may \"theosophi-"},{"pageNumber":758,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV cally\" add and subtract zeroes (144000 = 144); or foreshorten a series to its largest number values (so that, for example, 1 694443 may become 169). Aside fiom empirice demonstrating remarkable and ingenious numerical congruences by this means, Cathie seems not to extend the demonstration any further to a general justification or philosophy; however contained in this exhibition is seed of a full-blown rapprochement between the traditionally diametric fields of the mathematics of numbers, and the Qabala of numbers-+ may be found for example in the serendipity whereby two fiends situated at opposite poles of the problem, the physicist Richard Feynman and Qabalistic scholar Gershom Sholom, may marvel at the mystifying recurrence of certain numerical signatures in both fields even to the degree that Feynman's long-time bogey 132 winds up being the room number of the hospital in which he dies, being also and \"coincidentally\" the very number value of the term Qabala (QBL). Indeed, Cathie not only finds innumerable, interlinking harmonic correspondences through the \"speed of light reciprocal\" (2640) ... the distance between proton and electron in the hydrogen atom (5.3 x 10'\" meter) expressed in geodetic inches (205.81 80628 x lo-\") and so resonantly aligned with the harmonic value 20581.80628 (number of magnetic lines of force per sqwe geodetic inch) ... the harmonic circumference of the hydrogen atom in geodetic feet (1 07.76 10) divided by 8 or the circumferential spacing of allowable electrons in the quantum shell, so as to render the value of 13.47 units-or 26.94 for the double cycle of the electron half-spin corresponding snugly to 2693645 (representing the value of geometric energy belonging to his unified field equations); he shows how such harmonic correspondences imply a demonstration of some extraordinary physics, correcting for certain conventions or fixed terms of standard physics: he shows for example that the differential harmonics in lines-of-force of magnetic field densities divided by the harmonic value of spherical mass-radius, exhibits an equation with the value of light tbat's clearly one of interconvertibility, the velocity of light (in minutes of arc per grid second) actually reducing proportional with mass-acceleration-or as Cathie might wish to express it, the energy from the velocity hysteresis going directly into the compound-wave harmonics generating grid patterns of mass-matter and the periodic table of elements. He demonstrates as well that the frequency-cycles of madmatter involve a flux between keinomatter and antimatter which constitutes a variable relative to masdenergy gravitational acceleration etc. (cf. the MT explanation of these same terms, productive of the same conclusions prior to having ever read Cathie, re spacetime travel and \"saucer\" technology in Vol. 2, No. 6 of Z'NTC, \"T-Bird Meets the Phoenix\", Chapter V). He shows that ratios in allowable isotopic progression of an element, harmonically expressed (the threshold value for a given element being 1 :l. 694443) encode geometrically the same values as that of the square diameter of the basic hydrogen atom; that the latter is identical in number to the harmonic of mass within a light-field, 1694443; and that an acceleration factor of gravity derived from the reciprocal harmonic of the unified energy value-2693645-corresponding to a specific latitude-coordinate from the geomet- ric pole of the grid matrix, when multiplied by 6 in accordance with the allowable isotopic ratio between proton and neutron results in exactly the number 169.4443 ... by decimal dismissal, the same as the 1694443 harmonic equal to the term of his -ed field equation (C +file) where file is the \"speed of light reciprocal\" 2640. In this way the formula of gravity acceleration is expressed in the harmonic equation C +fiK over 6, at the center of 1694443 (the harmonic of spherical mass in the radiant field)."},{"pageNumber":759,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV We've gone to some length here to distill Cathie's equations, since the snaking interre- lations of the number-harmonics through the mass of his proofs across the expanse of several books tends to obscure some fundamental points, and some key elements-and we'll need these keys cut to precise fit, in order to show how the New Zealand quake occurring on the exact date of the \"Ma Logos\" prediction (by our account, issued directly fiom the \"shadow government\") was necessarily the result of an art$cial engineering job, aimed at the designated target of Los Angeles and \"mysteriously\" interfered so that it kicked right back into the lap, as it were, of one of the triangulating units involved in the operation. Touching Down With The Grid-Analyst We may first of all note that our grid-analyst Cathie is, interestingly enough, a native of New Zealand; and that his mapping of the global energy grid resulted as an extrapolation hm subtle coordinates he'd discerned in the process of plotting local New Zealand UFO sightings. In the course of developing his thesis, Cathie quickly became aware he was onto something, something already known in secret quarters; as he procedurally published his results he was evidently monitored, and then even contacted-for example, by receiving direct authorization of his govern- ment to continue his researches (!) and by their request to be furnished a list of pre-calculated explosion dates for the French nuclear testing of Mururoa Island in the Pacific, in 1968. He became aware the grid-harmonics and power-zones in the UFO trafiic lanes were well known already by at least several governments, most particularly that of the U.S. It even became a matter of routine prediction when, in his calculations, he'd abstractly triangulate the next set of coordinates for the grid power-zones and inevitably discover a military installation replete with radar and even more exotic technology already parked there--or he'd be able to anticipate where the next U.S. military campaign would be waged to persuade some local government to play host to such an installation. Indeed, Cathie recounts the long drawn-out contention which occurred as far back as 1968 when the U.S. had determined New Zealand's South Island Lake Pearson locale would be ideal for installing the aerial transmitters of an Omega navigational station; controversy raged over the actual purpose for installing such a facility, as its speculated purpose--that of aiding Polaris submarine navigation-was unlikely since existing inertial navigational systems were much more accurate and reliable. At the same time, the New Zealand press disclosed the fact that personnel involved in such an operation would be covered by the Off~cial Secrets Act. At the behest of protesting university students, Cathie calculated the coordinates as functions of his UFO related grid-network and found the Lake Pearson locale was the only place such an installation would make sense in terms of the relevant, geometric values. Cathie and other researchers have long since reached identical--indeed inescapable- conclusio ns... i.e. that the world governments especially represented by the U.S. are perfectly well aware of the global grid-harmonics at their most closed-club scientific level; that they have in fact long preempted the major power points around the globe, so that the elaborate meshwork of radar installations is in fact being employed to keep up a dialogue with the UFO traffic, indeed may well be routinely used to test terrestrial UFO vehicles (in all probability copied from crashed or \"captured\" extraterrestrial vehicles). Keeping in mind what Bearden and others have shown regarding the \"unique\" adaptations to scalar-type technology which can easily be made using current em and radar equipment, even more various potentials with respect to gravitational"},{"pageNumber":760,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV harmonics of the global energy-grid suggest themselves as flowing fiom the adroit \"coincidence\" of such sites. Here is Cathie, summing up his estimate of the potential involved in strategically commandeering these geomantic points (hm The Energy Grid: Harmonic 695, The Pulse of the Universe, pp. 5-6): \"The controlled manipulation of these resonant factors would, in my hypothesis, make it possible to move mass fiom one point to another in space-time (that is, to the eye of a theoretical observer, instantaneously); or to change the form of mass to a more, or to a less, tangible state. The contraction or expansion of time could also be controlled by the same manipulations of harmonic pulsations, or resonances, since time has a direct relationship with the speed of light.\" Fixing our collective Eye squarely on the thesis of this editorial, then, let's see whether it may be inferred that some such powers as Cathie projects, at least in their embryonic stages and perhaps even in advance of that, already abide within current capabilities of the \"phantom\" power structure and its military enforcement arm-d of course, whether they'd recently been wed in the manner described. Going Through A Phase: The Thunder From Down Under In last month's MT Editorial, the hidden physics at work in \"phase-conjugating\" a scalar-type artificial quake potential was outlined. In principle all that's required is a phase conjugate pump to harmonically amplifL atomic potentials of the \"mirror\" into which the soniclem input signal fiom the faultline is to be fed, and an over-the-horizon radar unit suitably adapted to emit and direct the \"conjugated\" or time-reverse signal, bouncing it back down the original beam with all its built-up charge and restoring it by magnified resonance to its output-source. In practice, a more measured and precisely modulated form of the process can be tailored to tease remarkably-subtle nuance fiom the system; the use of several installations at strategic points around the globe simultaneously, can serve to triangulate and interfere a relatively sophisticated infr;lstructure pattern through the projected field so as to be able to \"code\" the feedback-resultant with specific gravitational and resonance potentials etc. In this way the remarkable, \"forward\" and \"backward\" control they'd seem to have to exercise in order not only to trigger but to check the \"avalanche\" factor involved in resonance-fiddling with the faultline, could be managed the more easily. Of course there are tricks to the process, bugs that need be worked out This is why the several \"random\" discharges of faultline tension in Northern California around the relevant dates, generally unremarked because of their remote harmlessness, seem to be related to a \"practice drill\" with the globallydistributed triangulation equipment; both MT and AAA noted the \"on\" state of artificial etheric-current potentials at the time. It be remarked here that, in researching technical aspects of the subject during this time MT discovered, in a Bearden text, the reason for a phenomenon associated with the general effect to which both he and AAA referred without exhaustive explanation, i.e. the felt sense that the current in question was \"turned on\" days to a week-or more--before the targeted date of discharge, and turned \"off' only after a similar interval. The sole \"explanation\" offered to inqujr at the time was represented as conjectural, i-e. that it seemed a prelii charge had to be built before release and that such a charge might be proportional to the magnitude of the effect. As it turned out, the \"conjecture\" wasn't so far off; on page 186 of Bearden's AIDS, Biological Warfare, Col. Tom notes"},{"pageNumber":761,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV that in practice there is a time-delay in producing \"gravito-inertial effects\", related to capacitive charging and discharging the ''time constants of mass-nuclei\". To the astute reader this corroborative disclosure should suggest two things: since MdMT were unaware of the formal explanation of the phenomenon at the time, their having described this peculia~ity-later explained and thus confirmed in a formal text--constitutes one of those \"blinds\" beloved of scientific researchers, where data not generally known to the public is withheld so as to see whether a subject (giving general description of a \"UFO abduction\", for example) will be able to relate some fact not belonging already to common knowledge; and it should suggest as well that Bearden, being able to relate one of those practical little details belonging to the irreducible empiricism of bench-engineering and confirmed by the adepts ' independent testi- mony, certainly knows whereof he speaks in more than an abstract or conjectural sense. Someone's trying to tell someone something. Now, let's return to the New Zealand quake of September 8, '91 (the precise date predicted by the Mairona-fkom-Sedona for the L.A. area). Having made the proper \"ablutions\", reverentially paused as the old texts say and then done the work that had to be done, the S.C. adepts were apprised by students (after lapse of the first targeted date without local disturbance of any significant kind) that, in checking with seismologists there had indeed been a quake of the relevant magnitude clear around the globe. At this, MT set to work \"with calipers and compasses\" (as the old magician-cartographers were wont to do, you know); and, plotting a triangulation of harmonic coordinates fkom the suspected military installations through the grid-line locus of San DiegoLos Angeles, an interesting geometry immediately emerged. Using square-root tables it became apparent that certain relevant, numerical resonances were established across harmonic sections of the grid polar squares (as plotted by Cathie and others) in arc minutes toward the geographic poles. These were factored and factored again to distill the single set of numbers that would confbm the exact harmonic demonstrating irrefiagably both the optimal triangulation of the L.A. zone through those propitious locales (so as to generate complex-nonlinear resonance pattern strongly curving local- spacetime as a \"springboard\" for the input signal) and the resultant, unexpected-from their pointsf-view-mirror-reversal of the conjugate signal itself. ..which if the calculations involving our additional \"vector-input\" were correct could only have redounded to the particular vertex of their triangulating pattern belonging to the mapcoordinates of-Wellington, New Zealand! Sure enough, when the final set of numbers was distilled, the resultant representative number for the \"double/phase-conjugate\" harmonic turned out to be... 961. Motto-In-The-Grotto: Here Comes The Sun; Salutations 31 This number not only fit the exact specifications of the term that would have to emerge if the \"hypothesis\" of reciprocating phase-vectors was to be approved; it was also particularly rich in the keys it afforded to mifling certain formal \"codes\", most especially the Cathie grid-harmonics (which were subject still to criticism in conservative quarters for their unorthodox usages) and the basic equation of recent Supersfring theov-relating all this as well to certain trademarks whereby the presence of the Southern Crown adepts in the midst of it all could be quietly vouchsafed. For look: 96 1 is the mirror-reversal (phase-conjugation?) of the basic \"Cathie\" harmonic expressing the value of spherical mass in a radiantfield-i.e. the number common to and integrating energy-light-mass properties, 169 (recall that the basic number 1694443 can shift its possible decimal places, and round off to its highest values by dropping digits to the right). Is it not"},{"pageNumber":762,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV consummately interesting that this resultant number, which mirror-images Cathie's key number relating energy-light-mass should also be the exact square of the number 31? (3 1 = 96 1). The reader may refer back to the article \"The Motto in the Lotto\", Vol. 2, No. 1 MC for an extended discussion of the central spiritual and physical valueis associated with the \"Aeonic Key\" 3 1 ; suffice here to recount that 31 turned out to be the very number finally derived by physics researchers Schwarz and Green in solving for the equation of Superstring theory, i.e. the \"Theory of Every- thing\" which exactly integrates and identifies basic values associated with energy, light and mass. (Note that if Cathie's 169 represents \"mass in the radiant field\", the mirror of that number certainly suggests the time-space reciprocal of that condition, a value essential in the contemplation of any type of \"phase-conjugate\" mechanics.) Finally, we discover the internal harmonic connection resolving Cathie's key-number value 1694443 (its extended form), with the equivalent key-number value of Superstring theory: by serially adding the digits in Cathie's number we summarily see the mystic number reappear: 1 + 6 + 9 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 31. (The digits in 1691961 themselves add to I6 the number of NUIT, of the gravity-light reciprocal, the \"Sweet Sixteen\" of Coral Castle's Ed Leedskalnin etc.--cf \"Motto in the Lotto\", op. cit., as they say.) All that's left is to note that the number 3 1 has long been associated with the Presence and teaching function of the Southern Crown adepts, and encodes a central formula of their work Therefore, in solving for the question as to whether there indeed occurred a nefarious effort on the 8th of September past, to offket the seam of Southern California just a little (and iftherefore such an effort was indeed blocked by other agencies or even reversed), there appears an unerring numerical presence not only suggesting both circumstances have high probability of being the case but indicating the very ID of the factors and forces involved in \"blocking\" that particularly pernicious \"kick\", and deflecting it for a Safety. All the relevant terms and quantities have been given, or implied, whereby the back- ground \"work\" in the derivation of these proofs may be duplicated--except for the IatitudeAongi- tude loci of two of the three installation-sites involved in the triangulation process. These coordinates are only known with surety to the ''parties \" imolved--so we address them directly now (we have every confidence the Bird is regularly read and consulted by the relevant shadow agencies ... we've certainly received communication enough--overt or disguised-to confirm that this is so, including communications involving the unmistakable signature of an advanced-\"impossible\" technology automatically eliminating competitive possibilities! more on this to come, for this fact itself fits certain of the reasons why these unthinkable things are indeed not only contemplated, but routinely done). We directly address the relevant rascals, as was said, since \"you\" alone and uniquely know the correct coordinates and can recite the relevant trajectories, therefore alone and uniquely may marshal to move the beads on your abacus to calculate and confirm whether what MT has to say is not strictly and immaculately true: so be it, so mote it be, let it be heard let it be done, AUah disposes etc. etc. As for the San Jose quake of September 1 1 tallying dates for the second set of Sedona predictions, the fact that it fizzed from there rather than flared seems more the function of a \"draining of enthusiasm\" with respect to the culpable parties, or the meanwhile-receipt of another \"set of facts\" bearing on the opus, than anything \"opposing\" agencies might have done in driving the probable forehand back over the net--since the deflative atmosphere of progressively-diminishing"},{"pageNumber":763,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV aftershocks actually had the effect of leaving one with \"dukes up\" and not much to punch, for all the parrying stance. If then, as unthinkable as it is, all this might well be true, the reader would naturally ask why (considering the severity of the situation and calculating ergs of straightforward physical might with respect to the apparent opponents) the adepts of S.C. would chance to make these \"statistical\" verifications and descriptive details so publicly known, in effect giving away the very address of the potential nemesis that might have taken some of its effective force precisely from an ongoing anonymity. Does the unnamed Strength with which an earthquake is apparently deflected, also serve to protect those who might function as its immediate agency? To this fair question the SC adepts readily respond, since the answer explains very much of the hidden purpose behind it all (above that briefly recounted in the last issue), and at the same time permits a further filibuster toward the overhearing \"source\". Got You Covered First of all, the SC adepts are under no illusion they're actually participating in some sort of occult Pugilism where the antagonist growls \"okay, let's see what you can show me, buddy\", and blows are then traded between combatants on a general par in terms of respective resources. No such match is taking place; in a certain sense the demonstration as to what exactly may be marshaled hm Magickal side of the energy-armamentarium is being conducted under the provi- sionally permissive auspice of the \"antagonists\"--and necessarily so, since in extending the implicit challenge/warning to begin with (the artificial L.A. quake of June 28 and the Sedona \"prediction\" pamphlet hot off the Langley press) the shadow force behind it all could easily have preempted any opposition hm any possible angle or field upfi.ont. The fact that the SC adepts were there to \"stand ground\" and set up magical shields to deflect the blow, bespeaks a distinct permissive tolerance, a settled-back \"curiosity\" as it were to see what might be there to see and so implicitly preserve them for a scientific field-study. No, the SC adepts are under no delusion that, if the power mongers had not explicitly wished it so and granted it, they might still somehow have \"been there\" to join the tectonic battle. Indeed to this very moment it's an atmospheric fact that they, and their ongoing readership, will only continue to have fun fun fun till Big Daddy takes the T-Bird away. End of story. (After all, just look around4e reasonable about such matters-Caesar still commands the Salad named after him, the real \"armies of the night\" ... The marauding troops of Mao took with no problem, and toppled, an Empire of peerless spiritual might in a virtual day. Do people really believe the Angels of Material Security now somehow hover-guard those garden gates of Gethsemane?) After all, the first signif~cant gesture made (in the face of cumulative cues re the pending \"act of the demigods\") by the SC adepts was to print a very atypical, virtually \"alarmist\" cover for their August-September issue, the stark QUAKE IS A FAKE! proclamation. There was only one reason to publish an issue that drew such sensationalist attention to itself, and profitable publicity for Southern Crown was not that reason: after all, consider this-While, like any other public or quasi-public figure MT has been criticized at least indirectly for a few things, he's never been accused of being less than thorough in the consideration of any given topic.

Can anyone really believe MT wasn't perfectly aware that the subject of \"quakes\", so touchy in any case around these needles-and-pins parts, would elicit a powd reaction especially when sealed in an article necessarily saddled with the unenviable obligation of framing a breathtakingly mind-grinding hypothesis and on top of that implicating the very \"administration\" (or secretive subdivisions thereof) so recently canonized to popular consciousness for its Iraqian oil exploits? (However, as a matter of technical interest to \"those\" very busy of late keeping statistical tabs on public reaction to acceptance-stretching propositions stuck up over the lights of the media mezzanine like so many Punch-and-Judy puppets staging test-market dramatizations for future government sales-projects- \"you\" may be interested to know that the reaction actually received at this end was largely favorable, although this obviously in no way indicates the true quotient of adverse reaction generated in the silently-benumbed majority ...) Needless to say, publication of the cover and coverstory was viewed as a \"no-win\" proposition, a \"thankless task\" etc.--so the only reason a wistful inhalation was made and the QUAKE issue thrust fatefully forward in any case, had to do with the desire of the SC adepts to draw the partimlm attention of that sector of the shadow government assigned the \"Cayce\" project--draw it and fix it on the unanticipated circumstance that now, even should they succeed in carrying \"it\" off to specified degrees and on the specified sites, their impact had been significantly compromised and undercut, their \"predictive\" ringer-in-Sedona having had the Wizardly curtain pulled away and the charlatan pants pulled down by that annoying T-Bird mascot foiling, in Toto as it were, the dark design that should have apotheosized the wench as Delphic. Thus the SC adepts first of all felt there was a way of disabusing the relevant powers at the outset, so that, feeling there was much less percentage in projected gains than previously presumed, they'd reconsider and it would never come to a full scale magickal test. However, it became quickly apparent to the T-Bird parents the current was adamantly on, and owing to logistical requirements for deterring such a thing they'd now have to apprise all students of the possible consequences of remaining with them in the area, dig in and \"settle down\" in anticipation of the tinny trumpetblast blown belowground by legions of the pseudo-Tzabaoth. (Hey kids! did you know that the tern Tzabaoth extolled of late in certain New Age quarters, while by traditional Hebrew usage meaning \"hosts\" derives etymologically fiom the root-term Tzab, army, and that this in turn derives fiom the reductive root Tza, meaning \"lizard\"? Just thought you'd find that \"intriguing\", you know--if you'll forgive the vaguely kiss-off buzzword.) Thus the gauntlet, as they say, was distinctly flung. The \"challenge\" was on. Do we then imply that the shadow government was not only looking to take a chunk out of California real estate for its own purposes but was looking as well to see what form of resistance, with what quotient of success, might be marshaled in response? Yes, we not only imply but state it outright, for we know so. In particular, the visored Eye of that vermifax agency was looking distinctly this way-not pugnaciously or with venomous relish but with the iris of chill appraisal, scanning as always for the \"usable data\" ... One must now ask what usable data? since the hypothesis put forward here thus far is that the \"shadow government\" found SC (both Southern California and Southern Crown!) expendable as a means of upping the ante on crisis-consciousness, and at the same time securing the required public credence in their \"predictive media\" for future ease of manipulation."},{"pageNumber":765,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Art Of The Deal, Bottom Line (Or, Dealing From The Bottom) Here however we must refer you to the deeper hypothesis, established over the two-year course of the Bird's journalistic presence and reflected also in the disclosures of others, re the long-term interaction of the military-government-power elite with various types of \"spacebeing\" at least since the 1940s. What actually happened in the (ongoing) interaction is crucial to an understanding of the present juncture of events, including the distressing prospect of pending artificial cataclysms--and here's where the initial premise tends to dissolve into a foam of conjecture by personalities, and even institutions, either injecting disinfomation (knowingly or by osmosis) or deducing according to the limit of the given conceptual \"delta\" fiom an inductive collation of clues. From what hangs suspended in the general atmosphere of information-leak, whistle- blowing or the moderate tree-shaking of the FOIA, there seems to have been an initial effort of government-military contact in the late '40dearly '50s followed by actual first person interview with a variety of spacebeing; such interview can best be understood as an actual bid made by the respective beings following a higher-dimensional law in which, responding to the invitation put forward, the divers types of consciousness (ultimately cardable as \"positive\" or \"negative\", cf. T-Bird vs. The Flying Saucers) may present their case, pending an implicit decision of alliance with one or the other by the local party that put in the call. Being nothing if not covetous of the mundane political power already acquired and wishing, typically, to both preserve and it, the terrene representatives in question naturally demurred fiom proposals of disarmament and so ultimately took up with the more comfortably Machiavellian types of spacebeing (you know, guys \"after their own heart\", figuratively and literally). Thus the military is generally presumed to have made \"treaties\", pacts of provisional alliance with mercenary agents ultimately identifiable+.dortunately-as ambassadors of the Orion empire. If you'll recall, it seems to have become progressively apparent to the rapidly consoli- dating \"power structure\" that in exchange for the promised technological advances, Earth-folk not excluding their own elitist members were being subjected surreptitiously to brain-wave modifica- tion/inculcation programs, post-hypnotic suggestion, abductions and outright disappearances-with- out-return etc. It quickly became apparent to the military-intelligence agencies that it was they who were placed in an unacceptably vulnerable position by their own, Machiavellian machinations. From here, a critical divide in the generally accepted story takes place-and it's precisely here that it's fatefully necessary to understand what truly happened as opposed to all the scenarios that have been generated because of what happened. At this juncture Initiated awareness has perforce appeared, endeavoring consistently to sort and properly align the separate strands of often conflicting or contradictory information for the public. Consulting the defintive source of both the information and the lore that now surrounds the subject, Matrix IIby \"Valdamar Valerian\", (cf. Book Reviews next issue) we may derive an overall impression of the real scope of what's taken place; more, initiated awareness may impart at this point an important consideration not generally understood by the public consulting this and related resources: i.e., that the phantasmagoria of underground installations, superscience espionage involving space and time travel, hallucinatory projects of bioengineering and infiltration of the"},{"pageNumber":766,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV fearsome \"reptoids\" as is found in the pages ofMatrix, while appearing at once as a massive upthrust mountain of mixed information, puzzleboxes inside puzzleboxes and signs so subtly crossed in Alice-in-Nightmareland fashion as to install the cumulative impression of stepping irretrievably into a whole Looking glass dimension (rather than simply \"reading\" in the anchoring familiarity of one's comfortable, standby study), represents as well the collective impression with which the most intimate and ongoing participants have been left. If Matrix is \"bewildering\" and dimensionally dislocating to the public, it accurately recreates and therefore establishes by mirror-verisimilitude the condition in which very many-even a rnajority-of the participating cognoscenti have been left.

For instance, the beleaguered personality who first brought this mass of information/revelation to the public, Bill Cooper, has taken recently to proclaiming personal subscription to one of the possible plots he'd always pointed out was lurking in the collected \"evidence\", i.e. the one which states that all we perceive being gingerly advanced in tern of mass media conditioning reflects a scheme of the worldwide power structure to \"prepare\" the public for a space invasion scenario featuring the gradually-disclosed reptilian presence4 subterfuge meant only to stampede the general acceleration toward Martial Law in consolidation of a New World Order. While it's evident that tacit government \"permission\" has quickened cumulative presentation of more overt/revelatory potentials (with respect not only to possible alien presence but the government's interaction with such presence), an inspection of the general thrust and content of that-structured-presentation actually proves \"they've\" wheeled out another contingency plan. It's not the space-invasion scenario they're emphasizing--to the contrary there seems to be every indication the invisible government would like formally to Unveil its ongoing interaction by revealing the carefully-sculpted bust of our spacealien benefactors. Why is this? Remember we said that, as far as the majority-elite of the invisible power structure is concerned, the type of bewildering/disorienting impression we get fiom the monumental Matrix Nalso characterizes their general impression. It's necessary now to understand what's taken place with the military/power-structure in terms of the higher dimensional negative design of Stalking (see past T-Bird essays and the book T-Bird vs. The FIyng Saucers). Rather than the \"reptoids from Draco\" being the veritable concoction, the brainchild of the CIA/NSA fabricated purely in order to terrorize the world into NWO consolidation, on the contrary it's the CIAlmilitary interface that is terrorized by their interval of experience with the \"reptilian presence\" in under- ground tunnels and those joint military-alien installations such as Area 5 1 Dreamland in Nevada. (Note we speak of a certain interface section of the defense agencies--there are those deep within the hidden government so intimately allied with the Orion signature behind it all that they do understand the terns involved, and actively participate in the promotion of the Stalking scenario.) The impression derived from Matrix N (which is a compendium, without that directional thrust some supexpose on it) accurately reflects the experience of the majority in the power elite. The phantasmagoria to which they were exposed in that interval had terrorized them precisely because a definitive demonstration had deliberately been given, under impress of the portrayed \"reptilian ferocity\", as to the technological and spiritual (i.e. p.sychic) superiority possessed by the aliens that they themselves were in no way going to be granted. At this juncture the power elite began it's omnivorous copying program, looking over the scaly shoulder of the nightmarish reptilian host with which it \"shared\" Duke's underground facilities ..."},{"pageNumber":767,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV May we see now, that it wasn't solely in order to keep parts of the civilian populace dreamlocked in a subjective Caligari Cabinet at the disposal ofthe Mesmerist that CLVNSA minions first prosecuted the execrable \"copycat\" activity recounted accurately-enough in Mahix Ir! May we see now that such random ‘‘nocturnal\" experimentation with the public in terms of brainwave control (cf. last article), hypnotic inculcation et al. was taken up primarily as a means of learning as much as possible about such technology so as to develop an adequate means of insulating fiom what they perceived as the aliens' clear psychic and technological superiority? (The fact that the mentality in question had been forever calling upon just such a circulll~tance, may be charitably overlooked.) Jeremiah And The Bullfrog- Like To Warn You About A Good Friend Of Mine At the same time and largely unbeknownst to them, as a feature of the Stalking scenario, they were pushed procedurally back upon tacit alliance with the little grey mercenary beings fiom Zeta Reticuli (whom they'd recently come to distrust as well), simply because they constituted the lesser of two evils--and because these particular Zetas were \"hinting\" thaf though technically servitors of the Draconian reptoids they secretly despised their masters, had come to cherish the Worn of provisional separation from them while on Earth preparing their scaly oncoming Path, fell in love with 3 1 flavors icecream and as a consequence were prepared to cement the alliance of helpfid technological exchange and unite as well with the terrestrial military to repel the anticipated, full-scale (so to speak) reptilian invasion calculated to come between '92-'95 in the form of a pole-shifting proximity between Earth and their traveling artificial planetoid (known variously as Wornwood, Nemesis and Marduk). Indeed, in scientific circles of the shadow government the recently discovered planet paradoxically \"orbiting\" a pulsar beyond our solar system and so baffling to conventional science (since its presence defies current concepts re the formations of planets and stars) is certain indication of the progress of the traveling reptilian Deathstar, now temporarily tethered within visible range around a body just beyond our own system so as to fuel up on certain star-synthesized elements for the next leg of their ominous journey Earthward. Being authentically terrified by the Reptilians (who'd earned their \"reps\" while timesharing underground condos with the Delta Force) the power-elite was pressured through that implicit fishnet Stalking into perceiving the only plausible option as closer cooperation with the \"mutinying\" Zetas-who, looking all the same to Earth consciousness were hard to distinguish, one tribe fiom the other, and appeared close enough in features and behavior to the Andreasson dorks technically classifiable as \"positive\". Functioning then, on perfectly 3rd stagel3rd density consciousness they had no way of comprehending the terms and conditions of higher-density consciousness, either positive or nega- tive; they had no way of appreciating that, at the higher-density negative levels from which the greys were functioning there was no such thing as a \"Star-wars mutiny\" from their Superiors, thepsychic hierarchy of their relations automatically securing and locking in place an orderly set of flowlines defining a fixed pecking-order that could only be adjusted according to the rules of negative-polari- zation-for \"capital\" in such a system was obtained, and advances accorded, only on the basis of an entity or group having been personally successful in persuading and entrapping the negative polarization of a form of consciousness (e.g. the militarylpower structure) not yet technically"},{"pageNumber":768,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"committed\" owing to its educational existence at the admixedlspiritually-unpolarized 3rd density level. Indeed the object of Stalking was just that subtle imposition of a \"premise\", a delusion- ary scenario upon a targetf3rd stage consciousness structured to take advantage of its habit of perception in such a way as to draw said consciousness into predictably acting on implications derived fiom its characteristic distortion. Spiritual law of the higher densities positive and negative required, for true polarization, preservation of the he-will variable; if the potency of the volitional void-variable was to be added to the sum energy-reserves of the negative hierarchy, the targeted consciousness would have to be tricked into \"freely\" inviting the impositional government of the negative hierarchy. \"Freely\" requesting a stronger and more binding alliance out of reactive fear of a more terrible enemy, was surely a suave and economic way of accomplishing that conscious call and ultimate polarization-alignment toward the Negative. Thus the power-elite in general had no un- derstanding that the reptoids fiom Dram were bioengi- neered originally by the Orions (rather than being ge- netic evolutions of Earth's own dinosaur population, returning to reclaim its human genetically-bred popula- tion for food and slaveservice as the science elite pres- ently supposes); it had no way of knowing that the grey Reticulians with whom they invited a closer pact of \"mutual protection\" were not, nor could they be, in mutiny or rebellion against the Reptilians, but were instead, like the reptoids, participants in the cool calcu- lations of Stallcing supervised ultimately by the Orion empire. Therefore, according to their current capabili- ties of understanding and by pressure of their inbuilt cognitive distortions amplified and directed toward wholesale \"buying\" of the Stalking scenario, the power elite opted first of all not for fomenting a phony space- invasion scenario (for they truly fear a space invasion, which is what the Star Wars stations and Hubble telescope are doing up there in the first place); rather they opted for graduating public knowledge and acceptance of the greys into the mass media, as is happening now (take a good look again at the primetime network presentation of \"Visitors fiom the Unknown\", May 17, and read again the T-Bird article \"Ad Hominem Hocs and Hominy\" in Vol. 2, No. 6). And, though they don't truiy trust the greys either, from past experience, what does it matter as far as the public is concerned, who'll soon be fighting \"side by side\" with the greys in full-scale global defense against inpouring shuttlecraft fiom the disgorging Mother planetoid drawn within range? Thus cleverly compressed between the two \"opposing\" dramatis personae, the greys and reptilians, the consolidating Earth government may hope to accelerate the reality of its New World Order so as to create a maximally stable socioeconomic and political condition, plastically coordinated and globally changeable at a moment's notice while fum and homogenous in obedient orientation-- optimized One World army weeded of its superfluous population-elements, tailored to a computerized central control system and fully dependent for iti information and the staples of its very life-support on the directives of the power-elite, now the overt Owners of the World."},{"pageNumber":769,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV For the Orions' part, they need merely regulate applied pressure toward squeezing out those actions and behaviors from the pertinent members of the power elite that would secure the negative polarization of the latter. And what kinds of actions and behaviors would those be, which virtually guaranteed the \"status\" of negative (4th depsity) alignment? 4th Density Aptitude Test, Negative-Style Consulting past T-Bird issues on the subject of the densities, and in particular the bonus Chapter VI in the book T-Bird vs. The Hying Saucers, we find the criteria for negative polarization stated in terms ofjust how far the personality is willing to go in order to secure the aims of its power aggrandizement; if for example there are conditions under which the wanton slaughter of whole populations bearing no negative potential against oneself might be implemented, if such terms can under any circumstances be stated, then the sufficiency-of-substance for an authentic negative polarization certainly exists. If (for example) it could be persuaded that reptilian invaders were even now trickling in under guise of meteor showers, floating down the baleful beams of an eclipse or full moon and taking up an escalating residency in California tunnels and caverns, procedurally appropriating strategic underground military installations so the personnel there seemed suddenly entranced with a strange kind of workload, then a response relative to that assumption willing to \"do what it takes\" to eradicate the infestation (though it meant triggering tunnel-collapsing quakes of cataclysmic magnitude incidentally wiping out a vast civilian population as the price to be paid for preserving one's own power-autonomy) might well be considered negative-qualification enough. It's under considerations of this character that the green light for scalar-engineering a flux in the California faulthe was given, and it's under such considerations that it must be understood. During the time period in which such potentials hung most thickly over the S.C. ground, there certainly existed a detectable stress in the psychic atmosphere emanated from anxious surveys of the saucer-detection net doing diurnal double duty as both the military's regular radar and the power-grids supplying everyday energy to the life of the city. So it was that personnel of the shadow government were poised to commit a type of act which, owing to their tendency-of-orientation, was only considered expedient ... to the invisible Orion watch hovering above and around them, consid- ered a high moment of ceremonial sacrifice celebrating and securing an initiatory induction into the ranks of Negative Empire-at the low end of the scale, to be sure-a victimized cast of thousands to be immolated on the altar of the clashing rocks while ribbons of joyless jubilation spun up to the icy stars over the delirious dividend gained in consideration of Who and what else was ritually slaughtered in the bargain (the last time such great Negative Capital was made, the Roman Empire was secured). Indeed we need not assume this was the critical moment for such a wholesale Negative polarization to occur, to the benefit of the Orion ranks, but perhaps one potential moment amongst a regular interval of others: perhaps this scenario was set up as a test case, apossible but not necessary moment as far as the \"government\" was concerned, to engineer mass-excitation toward the New World Order along with mashing a nest of Lizzies under-the-rocks to boot. If this might have been considered more on the order of an experiment which. depending on the way things fell as the pattern progressed could be taken as a dry run or conversely as a real-deal, then there was a certain elasticity"},{"pageNumber":770,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV to the atmosphere and a number of variables to be monitored-not excluding certain factors considered as Wild Card potential that might yet hold value for them. This is critically important to understand, in order rightly to evaluate why we may be so sure this same invisible power elite (already %0 eaten up by the Psychic negativity they'd originally called, and to which they've been \"initiatically\" exposed) was looking with such interest upon the possible reaction they might generate, to their September-October earthquake overtures. It's this very same reason which informs the fact discussed in the final article, that amongst the sincere and desperate inquiries received by the Bird fiom victimized citizens re brain-wave control etc., there were also \"slyly\" slipped in at the same time objectively-similar inquiries fiom \"the boys\" themselves-meant to elicit the sympathy and technical advice routinely extended toward the public they victimize, but for their own ends. Why would \"they\" look this way? what was it they already knew, or might have suspected, in regard to what they'd perceived as blithely streaming bimonthly fiom the T-Bird quarters where jolly workers, like dwarves in the mine, brought up gems to be casually distributed at the feet of a preoccupied public? Leavin' It All Up To You- You Decide What You're Gonna Do As A1 Bielek has had occasion to observe in his lectures, at the seminal moment in the present formation of the scientific and power elite, in the late '40s against the background of the Philadelphia Experiment, those \"in charge\" of the relevant operations understood that a grand-scale catching-up would have to be done not only in terms of physics, but of meta-physics. Thus there has existed for many decades an unsuspected knowledge and background research characterizing key operatives of the shadow govenunent, such that against all popular conception they possess a very deep idea of theficnctional reality behind themes of \"incarnation\" and \"reincarnation\", what's traditionally gone by the names of alchemy, sorcery and magick ...they' ve rekhed and informed themselves to the degree that as pure pragmatists they value the perennial treasures possibly extracted from such knowledge. And, having an empirical confidence in the reality of much of this \"esoteric stuff' they're canny to understand that, just as many of them represent the incarnational return of certain scientific personalities belonging to backgrounds the likes of Egypt and Atlantis, so also--even as they've reappeared owing to the critical turn of all history around this very, transitional point--they have every reason to expect the similar return of many of the original Magi, the reincarnational swansong of those ancient Mystics and Magicians of the shrouded past even to the re- of that quintessential Magus founder of the Gnostic tradition, nemesis of the Archons and all around good fellow whose well-intentioned efforts to show Simon Peter the consideration he really wanted have been so historically misrepresented and misunderstood. Indeed they would expect such personalities to be around; and, once having updated the address of such ancient Initiators they'd be able to identify them, and their authenticity, with far greater aplomb than is given to the general run of humanity that continues to stare and head-scratch long after all the proper credentials have been shown. As MT and AAA have stated, \"the Negative always knows just who we are; they never have any problem!'' So \"they\" would look now in expectation toward what they'd already identified as a potentially valuable source of knowledgejince knowledge was what they were after, knowledge"},{"pageNumber":771,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV would be the term of their evaluation. Therefore in a sense the set-up surrounding their artificial quake-potentials, once it became apparent the design had been detected by T-Bird aerial reconnais- sance, served as occasion for allowing those responses to develop which-when analyzed--should show what the Initiatic order-of-things might have to contribute as a valuable means beyond the mere mechanisms of technology, whereby to parry and protect against powers that weren't just technical but belonged to an altogether-higher-order of Psychism they were grossly unprepared to deal with (i.e. those fearlid potentials demonstrated already by \"reptoid\" ringers mind-managing them to unqualified great effect in the underground installations). The fact is, they needed howledge and evidence of a term greater than the limits of technological object-manipulation, in order even to begin to deal with the fiightening amphibian of psychic-and-technological wizardry displayed by both the reptilians and the greys. They hew they needed a factor of balance that would serve to smooth the proportions and set effective sentinels on the perimeters of their own subjective \"sovereignty\"; they wished to learn how to protect against the very kinds of things they were presently doing to others-for, as much as they could satisfl themselves as to their extraordinary scientific ability to pull off prodigies of \"impossible\" power and render any target victim helpless without recourse, they knew they were exactly subject to the same vulnerabilities fiom the higher-density negative Approach. So then, MA and MT, what are you going to do, now that you know of the ' plan \"? and what can you bring to bear in response? It's for this reason alone that T-Bird press-wheels keep rolling, at least for the time; and for this reason also that no step was taken to remove the adepts fiom the site of effectiveness where, so to speak, the Powerstance would have to be taken to return the projected blow. (In response to the question as to why \"they\" don't just resort to the usual method of extracting the necessary information by force-\"they\" know perfectly well that in the special case of Spiritual Adeptship such coercion would only kill the goose which otherwise might, under some arcane clause, lay the coveted glut of golden eggs.) As for the response of the adepts in all this, knowing eyes look keenly over their shoulders hm the shadows, taking notes ... it might be questioned whether their policy of divulging straight out the information implicitly sought (even if it helps those authentically victimized and requesting assistance of initiated understanding) puts a powerful ammunition precisely in the hands of those most likely to use such intelligence to negative effect40 the extent of using it even to parlay present gains into a total negative polarization, thereby adding 4th density fieewill potency to the ranks of the Orion Empire ... To this possible cavil, the adepts of Southern Crown answer only this--the beings of the secret govemment, the NSA and CIA and DARPA are beings; they're beings born of consciousness like everyone and everything else. The business of the authentic spiritual adept is to contribute to and preside at, the Harvest (in this sense you may say that AAA and MT are the Happy-face Reapers). The interest of the authentic spiritual adept is always primarily in the prospect of serving polarization--and while the positive spiritual adept doesn't condone, encourage or participate in the process of negative polarization at all, nonetheless the decision of negative polarization is strictly honored and never interfered with, as it involves the most fundamental point regarding the value of the (conscious) free-will variable. The authentic spiritual adept tirelessly furnishes the instruction and the vehicular Presence of positive polarization-alignment, and provides the technical means of securing direct congruence with higher density values. Whether these"},{"pageNumber":772,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV technical means are consciously used in the direction of negative polarization, is My not their concern, being beyond the proper province of their authority once the positive instruction is fairly given. Since the basic concern of the authentic spiritual adept is toward polarization and the Harvest, and since the likelihood of those such as members of the power elite actually using and practicing the means impartially provided is much greater than that characterizing the run of humanity (seeing they're so much more motivated and engaged, in that sense) then the concern of the adept toward those polarizing either positively or negatively is much stronger in any case than it is toward the massive Middle, which, because of its inertia and indifference has scant chance of polarizing at all. There's always the possibility, magdied progressively with actual practice, that those really using the keys provided by Initiated Wisdom might, in the course of precipitating their polarization, discover through the innate value of their own revealed consciousness the wisdom of polarizing to positive cooperation and service--regardless whether they were initially tending toward the negative. At least there's a chance of positive polarization with such beings; whereas with the run of humanity there just isn't. You may say what you will--that's simply the way it is."},{"pageNumber":773,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV [First published in IWTC Vol. 2, No. 8 0ct.-Nov. '91) What Is The Global Energy Grid? by Mantik Teluria Having in our previous article looked into the Why of it, let's look a little more closely at the How--this question involves the greater understanding as to just what the energy-grid is. The energy-grid is of course a modem restatement of what was known to the ancients, all over the planet and independent of \"cultural diffusion\", as the ley-lines and power points of the ' terrestrial dragon--the serpentine braids of scintillant light subtly slithering in topographical conformity to contours of the World-map. Its criss-crossing course spawned angulated junctures of etheric intensification, at which the megalithic magician-engineers would affix their brugbs and roundtowers, their dolmens, quoits and pyramids. As Cathie derived foundational proofs of grid-harmonics through the coefficient of plain Euclidean geometries (e.g. the Pythagorean trian- gle), so the nodes and weaving lines of the energy-grid describe fiom an ideally aerial view a kind of polyhedral, crystalline architecture. Just as crystals are known to focus, modifl, code, store and transmit various electromag- neticlgravitational values, so the geometry of the world-globe acts as an energy focus and regulator. In order to understand how there may be an effective mutual relation or Archimedes influence between the human mindfbody form and the global energy-grid as is implicated here, it's necessary to grasp the ancient perception that they bear a term of mirroring correspondence rather than one of sequential derivation. The human form isn't just made up of the elements of the Earth, and the Earth isn't just compressed dust of cosmic elements. Their relation may indeed be demonstrated geometrically, through the rather well known glyph of the Qabala's Tree of Life. It's only necessary to note here that this representation of the correspondent linkages of microcosm and macrocosm configures the vertical lozenge of the human form; the Qabalistic commentator Frater Achad has shown in his Anatomy of the Body of God that the flat diagrammatic Tree of Life, if modeled in three dimensions and harmonically extended will flower in a discrete number of progressions to the rectilinear approximation of the sphere, exhibited by the crystal dodecahedron. \"God Geometrizes\" Through past T-Bird essays by the redoubtable Mother Terasu (i.e. \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness'?\" \"What is Physics?\" etc., various T-Bird issues) we've already come to learn that the elements of geometry aren't secondary conjugations of \"wave-forms\" etc., but that waveforms and all integral units of the manifestable fields-of-being are expressions of an informing geometry. Any such primary geometry functions as an abstract system of coordinates; it has a purely noetic value, and is therefore a term of Consciousness. Consciousness in itself is the Limitless Identity of Void-nature, infinitely self-consistent and abstractly congruent with itself to an infinite degree; the rigorous continuity and abstract"},{"pageNumber":774,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV regularity of geometry, is then the primary way in which Consciousness assays to extend that indivisible Value through the field of creative delimitation found resident in itself, as an innate potential of its permissive Limitlessness. The points, angles and lines of geometry comprise, in themselves, indeterminately self-conformant and internally consistent projections of the self-con- tinuity of Consciousness, through delimiting dimensions. Spontaneously sprouting the continuity and conformance of its identity withoutprefer- ence, consciousness reflects its absolute-value through a saturation matrix of potential coordinates totalling to a plenumS'mehy. Thus every geometric \"point\" in the creative tremendum (summing an indeterminate cross-correlation of planes, edges and angles etc.) comprises an abstract unity of coded variables dense with dimensional variety. Through that ultimately dense indeterminacy which is Consciousness itself, the resultant matrix of plenum potential may be selectively aligned so as to generate a minimal, internal triangulation of coordinate foci. Innumerable dimensional \"angles\" and recapitulating subsets of Itself may thereafter be generated in the extension of the basic-indivisible Identity of Consciousness, through compound planes and multidimensional patterns of focal identification; the Creative crystal of inbuilt, noetic geometries may then be polarized and \"interfered\" through cross-sectional, triangulating perspectives of its own infrastructure. The primal, super-saturated (indiscriminate) Symmetry of the Whole is then virtually subdivided, drawn into relief of contrastive/complementary components and progressively \"bro- ken\" by focal filtrations into locally anisometric patterns. In the anisometry of those compound focal pattems, there is naturally generated a polar tension of integral phase-harmonics; the angulated, tensor components of those harmonic values generate the field-lines and pressurized edges through which characteristic energies and defining states of a perceptual field are effectively propagated. Through this multidimensional, geometrized nest of focal fields and phase-axes, the common denominator of Consciousness may be understood as residing in infinite \"perpendicular- 'ty\" to the whole. *L As That unbreakably homogenous value, out of which the extended pattems and fields polarize in borrowing against its illimitable Identity (mimicking its self-conformance through delimiting planes), Consciousness may be viewed as the Common Pleroma4e natural Juncture and shared term through which all its extensions are Resolved, a kind of ubiquitous Middle Pillar zero-factoring its sum constituents and creative field-geometries as an invisible Presence in their midst."},{"pageNumber":775,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV It's only necessary to know this \"secret\" to understand how any cross-sectional version of that compound/multidimensional crystal, any degree of resolution whether apparently macro- scopic or microscopic and any angle of interception sees the same, central Presence of the Conscious value axially transecting and abiding in the midst of the given complex. The value of consciousness pervades the atom, the planet and the human form. Only the (proximal) degree offinctional symmetry or mirroring, coaxial cross-correlation and convergence through the given plane of \"intersection\" determines whether the featured organization is adequate in the instance to support the magnitude of Self-reflective consciousness. There is a distinct homology of correspondence, therefore, between the human mindhody form and the sphere of Gaia comprising its extended, environmental \"body\". Each is an emotional focus of Consciousness (\"emotional\", because the plenum of geometries and all complex-patterned extensions compounded of those geometries compose the potential self-epresentation of Consciousness to Itself, with respect to its own nature. They interpret to Consciousness what, in sum, it might possibly be, and so condense in symbolic terms a value-typology claiming the absorbed consideration of its whole-abstract Identity). Everything, in all the fields of manifestation, is vivified by the presence of that identity. All form appears through the persistence of \"memory-record\", which is the repetitious reflex of a given identity-pattern miming the indivisible self-conformance and infinite continuity of Consciousness itself. A Quotidian Cobra In this way we may understand the Earth-sphere, Gaia, as the demesne of asentient focus cross-indexing and encoding in a specific way the extended harmonics of a cosmic webwork, a crystalline grid of force vectors and interlocked fields. As expression of a particular focal geomerry, the celestial ball of Earth collects thelong fibrous edges and connective tendrils of a concentrated emotional matrix, only known by summary \"name\" as the angular relationships of planets and stars. Across the grid of abstract coordinates (as which Gaia is cosmically \"triangulated\") there first of all insinuates an astrcrl emissary of snaking form, its current-coils twining and overlapping in a thick strong braid of light impressing a general mood or emotional tone through its angular self-connections; it enwraps the abstract mold of the Earth-sphere as a serpentine egg, its path a continuous spiral about the implicit axis so that it veritably presides \"with its tail in its mouth\". This glowing coil of primary emotional resonance exhibits a diamond-back pattern of alternating faces and edges, the complementary lines of which converge and diverge through the caduceus pulse of polarized strands, luminous filaments concentrating solar and lunar currents through the cosmic focus. Such currents enter the coil \"perpendicularly\" as umbilicoid cables, the variable ratios of their interaction inducing electric/magnetic values of particular strengths or field intensities making the flow-lines of the coil thrash and twist; pulsing lights from the winking webwork change tone, quality and color with alternations in the ratio of the current Such cables function as autonomic ganglia of the enveloping, astral mood-field of Gaia, twined invisibly about the ubiquitous Axis of consciousness passing through and informing that sphere. They are then \"emissaries\" of consciousness, representing in their alternating ratios the degrees to which the whole-being value of consciousness may directly inform the processes of integration and harmony whereby the Earth-sphere functions. Their optimum ratio of interaction is"},{"pageNumber":776,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV equivalent to the Phi proportion or Golden Mean. The paths and arcs of the patterning gyres, energizing the successive phase-space of the etheric web, distribute themselves repeatedly through ley-line intervals as dimensional harmonics of the ratio Phi. By functional correspondence, the Southern Crown teaching has long emphasized that the optimum ratio in harmonic integration of the dual ganglionic networks of the autonomic system with the Conscious Axis, resides in the Phi proportion where the parasympathetic--or sedative- emphasis is the greater, and the syrnpathetic-or excitatory--is the lesser value (when by Phi-har- monk the \"lesser is to the greater as the greater is to the Whole\"). The composite astral ganglion (umbilicoid sutrahna) of the planetary network summa- rizes and orthogonally feeds the Ouroboric coil; at the dimensional lorn of that input cluster plexuses of the etheric current-centers organized, aligned and correspondingly distributed according to variable coded values of the autonomic \"cords\". The collective consciousness of the planet, through the astral body informing its field, determines (by mood-averaging the psychic, emotional and cognitive atmosphere) the prevailing state of integration that drives its current-processes; the relative coherence of the processing fields and the efficiency with which they metabolize the circulatory networks of terrene \"digestion\", is a direct function of the overall psychic state coding ratios of the polarized currents. There is then a direct relationship of correspondence between the mindbody fom of man, and the overall planetary field. This proportional harmony is coded into the structural values of the grid. The Geometric Round-Dance We may, for example, observe that the Ouroboric windings implicitly concentrate the total coordinate network of a multidimensional, crystal polyhedron, through specific directional flow-lines generating fields and energy tensors across the abstract nodes of those coordinates; they explicitly draw forward a lattice of observable energy-concentration in the form of interlocked \"dodecahedron\" and \"icosahedron\" sets. The faces, edges and axes of these regular solids are graphic facts, when the nodes and terrestrial grid-lines are methodically plotted. Geometrically it's well known that the dodecahedron and icosahedron generate mutual coordinates through which each implies the other by infinite mirror regress, in the ratio of Phi or the Golden Mean. The vital-etheric threads that spiral and project fiom central nodes or plexiform clusters (phase-organized by the astral ganglia braided transdimensionally through them) serve to pattern the geomagnetic grid itself. Their throbbing points of light, oscillating rhythmically across pres- sure-pulse wavefionts, concentrate a plenum of patterned potential. Within each jewel-burst there's rksumed an impression of superposed arcs and lines like origami-flowerpetals hiding in their folds a myriad proto-material forms, sylphs and shadow-grem- lins crouched 'round and integrated through the common calyx-41 such radial values summed to symmetric self-cancellation but continuously varying the internal stress of their angular compo- nents, like symmetrically balanced keys of a player-piano bobbing up and down by an invisible set of fingers. The internal, varying stress-potential of the enfolded etheric petals is in fact contributed by the \"fortunes\" of their components polarized and ex-folded through a dimensionally sectioning angle, where each is relatively uncompensated in itself and oscillates in time with complementary cosine values, like the undulant arms of the goddess."},{"pageNumber":777,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The neutralized \"point\" of the etheric pulse concentrating a plenum of patterning potential, is then the interval repository of a multidimensional index of flowlines and forces. As indicated in other T-Bird essays, aquick means of comprehending such a condition is to contemplate the Necker cube, which with a fluctuating invagination of focus arbitrarily recesses (and draws into relief) preferential an- gles--the points and lines of which are, however, \"neutral\" and \"stationary\" with respect to absolute position; and which, indeed, if extended by dot-outline as in our illustration so that the contributing sections are perfectly symmetric with respect to one another, seem uniformly to recede and balance into an homogenously indifferent or internally self-consistent figure-its superposed components, however, still being sub- ject to varying stress fiom the alignments of an ocular focus that may operate \"outside\" their neutralized/homogenous resolution, in returning to the fluxing relief of arbitrary value assignments at each angle. In this way it may be recognized that the coded substructure of each, pulsatory point in the compressive etheric wave-fionts carries a maximum of \"infoxmation\", received through changing switchboard in the fortunes of just those components-when, on the alternating pulse or beat phase interval, they \"appear\" in relief through a filtered (geometric) context of relatively uncompensated flux coupling, interchanging, interfering and otherwise participating as feelingex- tensors in the sentient em web. Thus the flashing wave-pulses and geomagnetic lines of the ether fields weave through and establish the matrix of the vital physical field, bearing subtle enfolded flowers of information the petals of which, when unfolded or \"extended\" (fiom another dimensional angle) appear as asymmetric-preferential, chiralic--spirals interchanging across polarized~complementary ex- tremes. They flow through and inform the metabolic processes of nature's electrochemistry, the way acupuncture ducts and subtle meridians compose the space-marks or infrastructure harmonics integrating and coding physical processes, regulating cellular growth etc. according to convergence lanes of arterial information. Indeed the complex of chakras, currents, heaters and subtle meridians in the mind/body structure enjoys an extended counterpart in the nature-field as a whole. The Planetary Form Of Man: Anatomy-And-Physiology Of The Body Of God The relative, integral harmony of subconscious current networks through the mind/body being as index to the potential congruence of identity-force with the Conscious axis or Whole-being channel, is paralleled in the planetary body. The key lies in the operative ratio of interaction between polar pulsatory currents of the autonomic nerve-networks, for each current separately mediates an overall value of consciousness: the sympathetic network is the fightlflight, excitatory system and the parasympathetic network is the sedative or relaxative system. Therefore the key ratio of interaction serving to integrate them most deeply though and in conformance with the Conscious"},{"pageNumber":778,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV axis fiom which they issue, is the Phi proportion emphasizing (as the \"longer segment\") the parasympathetic or sedative system. Just as the heart center represents the critical, electromagnetic transducer receiving umbilicoid influx of the dual astral currents informing the autonomic processes, so the abdominal center represents a critical juncture at which the consciousness-systems align and practically integrate the feedback infomation received through the autonomic currents: the locus of the solar-plexus in the human form constitutes the vital-physical juncture at which variable ratios of input fiom the splanchnic nerves and adrenal cortex of the ~ympathetic system, and the vagus nerves of the parasympathetic system, determine and are determined by relative degrees of alignment (or self-congruence) with the conscious axis. The vagus nerves of the parasympathetic system closely link with nerves of the cerebrospinal system. In the same way the planetary \"heart\" receives influx of the polarized astral currents surrounding and informing it; and the planetary \"navel\" mediates the complex, nonlinear conver- gence-factors through which the dual processing currents variably align and integrate along the global axis of consciousness. The ongoing total of energies and influences through ganglionic nerve-networks (and their infeeding systems) imparts a general charge and field-pattern across the mindhdy form, of variable integration and alignment according to the sum harmony of psychi- cally-coded inputs; in the same way, the knotted weave of cords and macrame networks around the globe induces a net charge and imparts an overall current polarizing lines and magnetic axes of the Earth-sphere. To the degree that the dual currents become \"poised\" and their polar, alternating processes suspended (as when their flu-phases become locked through breath retention, or balanced through surplus biomagnetic charge upon a deeply efficient metabolic economy), the coded potentials of the virtual etheric infi.astructures are drawn into rotational alignment so as to allow their creative values optimum information-exchange with molecular patterns of the higher- dimensional, homonal keys-keys to the plexiform locks of states, planes and current-values of the mindlbody whole heretofore \"subtracted\" by filtrate reduction, and locked away in the etheric ouroboros of the kundalini-nucleus. Here then is the secret of it all; at the neutralhalanced juncture in the polarized interchange of complementary values, there occurs a transdimensional twist-a subtle rotational flux across an invisible, dimensional divide where the polarized terms secretly collapse and cancel in a symmetrized inhstructure of probable components. This mutual \"phase\" in their fluxing interchange resolves them as tempodsequential elements, first of all; the oscillations of sinusoidal values, the rhythms and metronome motions in the radiation patterns of all component systems (establishing directional arrows in the apparent flow and distribution-rate of \"the\") are vectorially vetoed at this perpendicular juncture. Maximum organizational potential is drawn forward and entropic-potential cancelled, so that--in effect-4ig- natures appear which in the ordinary context look time-reversed. That which is maximally organizational is synergic, or negentropic; note that gravity potentials, neutral of charge and of spin 2 value (i.e. the + and - signatures of oscillating poles super-added to produce neutral charge and doubled bosonic spin) are scientifically considered the most logical candidate for negentropic processes, since they generate optimum organizational potential through curvature of spacetime, rather than through local energy expenditures.

Between one full wave-cycle of the photon and the next there intervenes a moebius twist through the wave-cycle of antimatter. And, between the right-handed spiral of the south pole of a magnetic current and the left-handed curl of the north pole, there intervenes the cancelling moebius curve of the Bloch Wall. Gravity and em potentials are virtually perpendicular to one another. But \"gravity\" is the stress potential of a complexly enfolded phase-space: our origami flower of super-symmetrized loops and radial inputs. Every arc of a sinusoidal wave pattern is integrated through a multidimen- sional, nonlinear infi.aStructure at right-angles to it; its \"linear\" propagation boils up out of an ocean of synergic and creative-etheric potentials just as in \"What Is Physics?\" Mother Terasu showed the way in which the sine (the very signature of spacetime) rises up through and is equivalent to the qonential curve--the \"exponential\" being itself a unique signature of self-conformance and congruence suavely suited to our general definition of identity (in this case, invested in the identification-patterns of finitizing form) since its curve is everywhere equal to or proportional with its slope; and being, as well, an index of the nonlinear expansion in functional degrees of kdom (as with \"clock-doubling\" etc.). Thus the \"exponent\" on which sinusoidal flux-phases are borne, bears deep relation with the bristling creative potential of the scalar or etheric field. Indeed, all em patterns and properties of spacetime are just the exo-structures of the complexly superposed, symmetrically neutralized patterns of scalar inztrucrures. The exo-struc- ture is the unfolding of the idkstmcture; and the infktructure is the enfolding of the exo-structure. Along the \"line\" of spacetime itself they seem to flux back and forth, the em exostructure imperceptibly blinking out of existence, yielding at the extreme of its oscillatory reversal to the underlying, creative and synergic information patterns of the time-space inkstructure. Indeed there's a basic relationship between the spacetime \"reversals\" implicit in the properties of the positron, antimatter, the phenomenon signature-swapping of phase-conjugation, and the qualitative \"eversion\" of the scalarfield or implicate order as well as the optimally negentropic value of gravity itself.

'91 ] MIND/BRAIN BEHAVIORS If: HOUNDS OF HEAS7EN----BmG !CHE BWAVE BURGLAR8 The following excerpts fiom letters received by the T-Bird over the past year, have been mixed together randomly and allowed to flow into one another without separating quotes so as to mask the individual identities of those involved; the reason for this should become clear in perusing the collective contents, for all these excerpts pertain to the single theme of currenf covert espionage operations involving brain-wave monitoring and mind-control, conducted on involuntary subjects in the populace at large. As was indicated in the lead editorial article, amongst those authentic inquiries and depositions there appear covert inquiries received along with all the rest, which while they purport to be fiom ordinary victimized citizens like the others are in fact forwarded fiom the \"secret7' agencies responsible for much of the silent brainjmind monitoring. The reason for their having directed such \"disguised\" inquiries toward the T-Bird, was also touched upon in the lead article, where it was noted that although such agencies have long been practically familiar with the kind of technology involved they have been largely unsuccessful in developing defenses against it. This contretemps does not have primary \"Cold War\" significance, as commentators have fkequently suggested when describing the development of these covert powers in the conven- tionally-accepted context. As Dave Emory of Radio Free America noted in a recent broadcast on the subject, when the specter of \"Russian technological superiority\" has been invoked as rationale it inevitably turns out the U.S. is already ahead of the Soviets in those same areas. The actual source against which such agencies seek defense, is the same which teasingly extended the original leads relative to such supertechnology; the real fear haunting personnel of DARPA (Defense Department Advanced Research Projects Agency) and the counterintelligence branches has to do with the altogether transcendent faculty of spacealien factoti to impose just such technological manipulations unhindered, and indeed to do so fkom a \"density\" or higher-dimen- sional point of leverage which is untouchable and inaccessible where the militarists stand. The potent admixture of truly Psychic force with electrogravitic wizardry as characterizes the capacity of higher-density \"alien\" forms, preempts and completely outflanks anything that may be developed at the purely mechanical 3rd-density level. The military/powerstructure has certainly gotten the hint over the years that Psyche patterns Soma, and that the void-value of mind informs the complex nonlinear matrix of em identity-signatures in the same way that \"paper covers rock\". As we indicated in our lead article, part of the higher-dimensional negative pattern of Stalking has to do with imposing and stressing such a capability-disparity, turning up the pressure through fear-reaction (of an invasion threat etc.) so as to drive the targeted subjects toward deeper and progressively irreversible degrees of Negative polarization, i.e. driving them to commit a succession of acts-with their consequences--out of preservational self-concern that requires"},{"pageNumber":781,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV certain ratios of psychic balance inscribing threshold degrees of consolidative rnindhody \"inten- sity\" to the negative side upon the summary soul-record.

Thus the \"Orions\" unerringly herd their targeted Earth elite straight toward those doors containing the kinds of elements that can \"do the most damage\". Here then is the composite letter.

When asked who they are they reply, \"We're watchers': men asked why they are doing this they say, 'We don't know. \" They do tell me their names (orpseudonyms).

The manner in which these marvels are accomplished, has been detailed to a degree in available works; again we refer you to the writings of Tom Bearden, and also to relevant tapes available from Archives On Audio (4 15-346-1 840, P.O. Box 170023, San Francisco, CA 94 1 17) in particular the broadcasts of Dave Emory, Radio Free America. In one such tape he quotes fiom a 1991 paper by Harlan E. Girard delivered to the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on \"Coherent And Emergent Phenomena In Biomolecular Systems\" held at the University of Arizona; and he refers as well to a Dell Publishing reissue from 1977 by John Marks called \"The Search For The Manchurian Candidate: The CIA And Mind Control\"."},{"pageNumber":782,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV From the above sources it becomes persuasively apparent even to the average lay reader that such technology is fumly in the hands of government agencies; and that fact requires no hypothesis of \"unknown\" or \"secret\" technologies in itself, since well-known equipment (i.e. of the Cray supercomputer type etc.), even publicly available to some degree, comprises the backbone beneath the total range of engineered effect. (Initiated understanding would include, however, the practical presence of scalar technologies not nearly so well known, by which multi-leveled coded potentials may be patterned and directly discharged without \"intervening em waves\" through the brain-molecules of the targeted subject.) The principle behind these seemingly impossible feats of mind-monitoring, influence and controVharassment employing quite conventional technologies, involves the cmently \"hot\" science of Fourier analysis whereby any image, sound or sensation may be converted on an oscilloscope and analyzed into \"discrete Fourier transfom\"-4.e. audio, video, photographic or telemetrically-retrieved brainwave data may equally be converted to an equivalency of simple sine-wave signatures compared, averaged, integrated and digitized so as to produce a profle signature. Acoustic processors analyze vocal pattern, for example, and by Fourier transform continuously synthesize spectraI time samples which can be kicked out by the hundreds every second, correlated with stored prototypes in the processor and decoded to probable sentence-pat- terns. Since the human brain can process 5,000 bits of information per second, the capacity of current market computers to perform hundreds of millions of calculations a second through injection logic circuits easily explains how the subject's actions and ideas may be anticipated through analysis of preverbal thinking. It explains as well how computer response programs modulated to typed vocal patterns can produce the effect of voices discharging in one's brain as if in answer to thoughts, actions or ideas not yet clearly formulated in the mind of the subject (since the computerized vocal-patterns bypass auditory circuitry and resonate the brainlobes directly, no detection of mechanical artifice arises; the brain directly interprets the signal as human speech-pattern without tinny resonance, robotic diction etc.). In this way the brain-wave patterns of many subjects may be sampled, so that a functional signature of certain common or collective forms can be extracted (i.e. a synthesized pattern that would couple to and resonate the brain-wave signatures of all those sharing a taste for chili peppers, or those who participated in common belief-patterns as in a church or club); or conversely, the brainwave behavior of a single subject may be sampled so as to produce an ongoing pattern-analysis distilling the various types, ranges and idiosyncrasies of speech and though& mood and emotion into a sleek Fourier profile. Possessing these brainwave signatures (which, whether on a collective or individual scale function as fingerprints of selective identity-resonance), the \"agencies\" in question can target and fine-tune a subject long distance, picking the relevant wave-identity profile out of the hologram of complex interferences through which all things appear-inagnifying weak signals of motor activity belonging to the electrical precursor gestalts of speech pattern, for example, with use of the SQUID or \"superconducting quantum interference device\", and deftly extracting them fiom environmental noise. In this way all the invasive programs becoming progressively more \"familiar\" to the general public may be implemented without obstruction: thought may be monitored, and thought may be implanted; pain and pleasure centers may be stimulated, total sensory distortion or"},{"pageNumber":783,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV deprivation imposed, diathermic effects disruptive of the autonomic system generated. And all this seemingly without respect of distance, location, lead-shielding or any of the reusonable resorts which could at least minimally be counted on when such technology was still in its primitive implant stage (not to say that there isn't still a substantial bit of implant-work being done; the variables involved in this basically-nonlinear process make the additional assurances accompanying physical implant a desirable adjunct still, where implant is at all feasible). Stimulation of the brain and nervous system directly through microwave beam technol- ogy and ultralow frequency, gigaHeriz radiation masers constitutes an altogether formidable weaponry directed upon an unknowing and defenseless civilian population; add to this the lesser- known capacity to code and tailor complex scalar intiastructures into the em delivery systems, programmed with variable and siqultaneous messages involving any range of factors from emo- tional conditioning, subliminal trigger-responses and even health (cf. Bearden's discussion of the presently-operative \"death photon\") and you have a good composite portrait of that which the very perpetrators themselves most fear, seeing that this prospect of their greatest control is at the same time the threat of their most thorough subjugation, when displaced just \"a few inches above and to the left\". There is however asecret to this level of control, which is still, at bottom, material-reliant (it's that fact which after all makes the power elite aware of its vulnerability with respect to the higher-density \"reptilians\" etc.4.e. the biogenetically engineered and tailored \"Orion SS shock troops\"). That secret may be located in precisely the technical capacity adjudged by commentators perhaps the most frightening of all, i.e. the capacity to deprive the thought-process itself of one of its most identifying if taken-for-granted features, i.e. the ability to hear the thought internally as it's being formulated. We intercept the process of thought at the ordinary 3rd density level, as \"inaudible speech\". This is supported by the fact that thinking is always accompanied by electrical activity of the speech centers patterning nerve signals to drive the vocal apparatus. Although commentators attest they have no idea how this altogether disconcerting deprivation of the echoing feedback function belonging to inaudible \"verbalization\" of the thought is accomplished, initiated under- standing points to em interfering of the speech center itself as being primarily involved. It is noted that through this effect, thinking still goes on but seems suddenly shut up in vacuo where no corroborative and comforting echo of itself may be \"heard\". Despite all this, even longtime victims of brainwave manipulation may generally be distinguished from the superficially similar schizophrenic pattern which, while it also \"hears voices\", exhibits dissociation etc., is also accompanied by rapid verbal dysfunction--the speech pattern itselfbecomes dissociated, neologisms intrude constantly and there's every indication from this that the actual thinking of the schizophrenic is aberrative. On the contrary, a mindcontrol victim-even if he ultimately snaps under stress and shoots up a McDonald's-continues to display the capacity of coherent thinking as reflected in his speech patterns. As far as ordinary, 3rd-density level mindcontrol techniques are concerned, then, they do their distinctive work by seizing the effective zone at which thought is already being generated, at a pre-reflective level, into potential speech patterns. It is at this level that \"thought\" is identified, and its components analyzed. However--the very fact that such deprivation techniques operating through the speech center leave proof as to how thought continues even when disconnected from"},{"pageNumber":784,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV motor activity patterning neural messages, indicates that thought and therefore mind functions upon another level altogether, and on a deeper basis than may be analyzed in the context of Fourier transforms heavily reliant on verbal signatures. This is why it has been emphatically noted that the most verbally-oriented and communicative, are those most vulnerable to the technique of mindcon- trol. Herein lies the answer. The highly verbal being of 3rd-density is also emphatically left-brain (women have the verbal faculty distributed more evenly across the hemispheres, which only means that in \"3rd density\" context the left-brain verbal emphasis has taken advantage of the thicker corpus callosum and encroached on the gestalt or pattern-recognition function of the right-brain). The typical form of such verbal consciousness is a brainwave mixture strongly emphasizing beta-wme activity. These verbal brainwave patterns function on highly repetitive, habitual configurations-their very, verbal character adapts such thinking to the stylized linguistic convention of structured, formalized and very linear repeatability. This is why \"high verbals\" are so especially subject to brain-wave monitor and control--such highly structured and diag- tic thinking loans itself admirably to the necessary computer-process of averaging and distilling to an overall, typal profile. It is this same abstract-verbal, left-brain emphasis (at bottom a product of enculturation rather than genetics) which caused brain-researchers to believe for so long that specific muscles and their rote-mnemonic movements were stored in the motor cortex, and that word-order was the basic function recorded in the language-centers. Even with parallel-process computefs, there's a greater comfort and state-of-rapport between the ens of computer-technology and the braidmind paradigm based on 19th century notions of linearity and object-specific learning patterns. Modem brain research however knows a whole other paradigm wherein meaning rather than word-order is represented in memory and language; in which acts and their outcomes (aims and anticipations etc.) are represented in the motor cortex rather than muscles or movements. This is of greatest significance to the problem of mindcontrol, because it distinctly points away from autonomic or conditioned, linearly-ordered response patterns and toward the volitional void-vari- able of the conscious his itself. Language, motor activity and all other \"voluntary\" patterns of the being are based on an abstract-cognitiveficlcrum: the presiding idea with its form and aim powers a variable patterning process, indeterminately elastic in itself and maximally adaptable. It is therefore sensitively subject to initial conditions, and so participates in the basically non-linear paradigm of Chaos models through which an indeterminate interplay of \"angular degrees of Mom\" allows for optimum adjustment and responsive reorganization of coordinates. Such a sensitively contingent adaptability has always characterized the behavioral processes, but that fact has been habitually damped and masked by chronic verbal left-brain emphasis. What is called for, then, is a shift in the actual, functional ratio of emphasis between left and right-brain hemispheres. Such a shift would place proportional emphasis on the variable gestalt-patterning processes of the right-brain hemisphere, resolving the mindhody system as a whole into deeper congruence and true functional correspondence with its presiding, nonlinear (cognitive or ideo-form) values-4.e. meanings, acts etc. as opposed to rigid structural circuitry. Since such a significant shift would effect a deeper alignment with the central, adaptive variability and living responsiveness of the system as a whole it would necessarily draw the personality into deeper congruence with the essential, volitional void-variable coincident with the Conscious Axis"},{"pageNumber":785,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV itself. And this would be equivalent to the adjustment of balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve-networks of the autonomic system in favor of the sedative value of the parasym- pathetic, also characterized as aligning a more direct congruence between the subconscious response-patterns and the whole-being value of the Conscious Axis. Referring then to our T-Bird essay in Vol. 1, No. 7, ''Mind/Brain Behaviors: Why Some Citizens of Gotharn Fear Batman and Draw Reactionary Cartoons About Him\", we recall that any such reorientation and overall alignment toward the basic, nonlinear variability and volitional indeterminacy (i.e.fieedom) of the Conscious Axis necessarily results in a shift in the admixture of brain-wave patterns, recessing the ordinary beta-storm of cortical activity and drawing forward altogether deeper values of alpha, theta and even delta-thus bringing forward and integrating directly into waking consciousness the creatively elastic qualities belonging to the dimensions of dream, and deep dreamless sleep (i.e. those values and corresponding dimensions of the brain-mind most directly correlated with the essential, creative void-value of consciousness). As we learned from that article, far from the verbal-linguistic faculties--usually identified with thought itself- proportionately diminishing and disappearing, they're taken up and integrated into a much more powerful complex of brainwave activity which enriches and extends their power altogether; they simply decouple from exclusive association with beta-wave activity, and proceed to function on a far more optimal basis through dominant theta and delta patterns. What this means in terms of the specter of technological mind-control however, is that the usual accessible juncture at which identifjling patterns of the verbal-linear \"habit\" discharge and may be seized, becomes integrated and aligned to a very different principle. Typical form of expression may still seem to characterize the personality; but this is deceptive, for such forms aren't tied so tightly any longer to chronic patterns of one-to-one identification. Therefore \"typifying\" or computer-averaged values of representative brain-wave pattern dissolve into a more elusive, variable, creatively adaptive range and depth of brainwave mixtures progressively baflling to strict computer \"typing\". Such a transformative realignment is indeed equivalent to a higher-density shift in function; any deeper shift toward congruence with the volitional or conscious axis, corresponds to higher-density degrees of function. Thus, what's apparently called for from both \"victim\" and \"victimizer\" alike in conlkontation with the looming problematic specter of mind-control, is nothing less than total shifi to a higher-densityfiamework offinctioning. As large and preemptive a demand as this appears to be, the situation is such that \"both\" seem, mutually, to have been driven into a comer and there's nothing left to do short of making the 'iunthinkable\" leap. When reasoned through, such a millenniaVirreversible step into the higher dimensions of consciousness itself is the only way to get \"behind\" and therefore above (in terms of hierarchic flow) the otherwise-swift etiological stream gathering mind into the measured flux of the rigidly regulatory Sine. There are three basic exercises which must be engaged in order to demonstrate a practical, non-technological means of overcoming the mechanics of brainwave control; the mastery of these means is the only sure protection against such a thing, and at the same time secures one's \"sovereignty\" of psychic function against higher and even more subtle forms of mental interdiction generated from potent conscious planes."},{"pageNumber":786,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV [I] Charger Breathing [2] Banishing Star-pentagram [3] Hounds of Heaven [I] Whole-charger breathing as outlined in past issues of the T-Bird, furnishes an ideal first step since its oxygenation of the system and ionization of the bloodstream generates a very rapid metabolic economy for the overall, mind-body complex; through this deeper more integral economy (spontaneously powering a subtle shift in ratios-of-emphasis across the autonomic systems in favor of the pararympathetic, correspondent with the ideal value of Phi aligning subconscious current-centers in exact proportional equivalency with the Conscious axis fiom which they spring), a surplus \"charge\" may be quickly accumulated at the vital-physical battery of the solar plexus. High negative ionization-potential translates into greater magnitudes of negatively entropic~at- tern-building-~ynergic energies, or subtle \"pranas\", drawn directly into the economy of the system through electron surplus (electrons are the atomic \"void-navels\" or points of physical ingress into the transdimensional infrastructures finely coding and \"building out\" variable nucleon patterns \"fiom the inside\"). While the pH factor tends to average-out the ionization potential, the prana drawn in through it doesn 't neutralize but accumulates, each energy surplus reinforcing and adding to the average across the solar voltaic at the manipura. That surplus charge in conjunction with the deeper metabolic economy, means proportionately less bioelectric energy need be invested in the hormonal and neurochemical cycles conventionally claiming the available energy-capital; the surplus may be used to power glandular chemistries of a higher integral order, manufacturing hormonal keys to complex-dimensional \"locks\" of the plexiform centers only present previously as dormantlpre-coded potential of the biogenetic pattern. Unlocking of those threshold values of the multidimensional being, generates a progres- sively deeper (functional) congruence between subconscious systems patterning the mind/body networks, and the Conscious axis itself. Such a deeper, multidimensional alignment and integration doesn't mean a more rigid-inflexible structure; on the contrary, deeper integral harmony of the autonomic with the conscious systems imparts to the former greater available values of the latter, so that the essential indeterminacy belonging to void-consciousness allows for expandingly elastic degrees of hdom in the variable patterning of memory-codes and subconscious circuits. The resonant harmonics of the sine-wave patterns emerging fiom this integral alignment* are highly non-linear; reflect a deeper ratio of emphasis on gestalt, right/brain perceptual and cognitive patterning; magnify the presence of theta and delta, incorporating the normal beta functions; and express the presence of an operative mind/body complex progressively functioning between the electrical frequency ranges of 400 cps and 200,000 cps on the electromyograph, out of range of the ordinary 250 cps indicative of 3rd-density cognitive patterns (the latter being optimally, the former being minimally subject to Fourier analysis, averaging, identification and resonant duplication). Charger Breathing is therefore a principal means of \"pumping up\" the mind/body system out of range of technological aim. In the practice of Charger Breathing, there is no group profie sinewave signature generated since such practice resumes the totality of mindbody systems fiom the biophysical pole rather than the mental pole; its effects are immediately nonlinear to a high degree, and there is no characteristic mental response or linear tailoring of a common, cognitive profile as there would necessarily be in resort to a belief system. This is why under the insidious"},{"pageNumber":787,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV circumstances of brain-wave control, the victim finds that \"turning to Jesus\", \"petition by prayer\" to the favored denominational deity etc. doesn't work, and indeed simply generates a high-profile identification pattern. In the event that the subject/practitioner's physiological response-patterns are highly monitored already, owing to braidmind access through signature thought-structures, one may avoid punitive pain-center stimulation etc. by varying the intensity, depth, time intervals, locations and accompanying activity relative to performing the exercise. ~x~&imentation is the only means of determining the optimum combination of factors. [2] Mentally visualizing the Banishing Star Pentagram three times a day or more, produces several important interrelated effects. Firs1 of all the figure of the Star should be traced in the imagination, at the general \"locus\" of the third eye center, approximately 1 ?4 inches between and above the brows and 1 '/12 inches behind the frontal bone; progressively produce its image (to the extent of one's visualizing ability) along the trajectory indicated in the diagram. Thus the image is drawn in the imagination from the bottom left-hand ray and around. There is a very wide range in the ready capacity to perform this or any visualization exercise. The instruction is to simply do the best you can. Try to visualize the image in scintillant electric-blue lines, the quality of neon tubing. Even if you can't see it at all, or visualize the color accurately, or hold it steadily or retain all its lines and angles and segments at once, it is the intent and efort to do so that counts---not the degree of positive result. The intent alone instructs and activates appropriate centers and lobes of the braidmind. Current alignments and ratios-of-rebal- ance are generated in response to the abstract form as an idea in its own right It's important to understand the effectiveness of visualizing (impressing the subwn- scious systems with) the idea-intent of such a basic geometric figure. The reader will note the honor paid geometry's noetic status in the ordering of all energies, dimensions and zones for the mind/body complex and creative field as a whole, in past T-Bird essays (i-e. \"What Is The Mother Current?\" \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness'?\" and \"What Is Physics?\" etc.). The noetic value of geometry underlying all fields, imparts immediate efficacy to the conscious/volitional projection of any such pattern through the generative locus of the third eye center. The projection or willed impress of such an image energizes, reinforces and optimally organizes the states and current fields coded through its abstract presence. The traditional image of the Star-Pentagram has optimum symbolic and literal potential for the nature-patterns and mindhdy form of man. It constitutes a key organizational template. Its pentagonal lines and proportions can be found in the physics of the water molecule; the Fibonacci series recurrent throughout nature; the crystalline lattice-network of the DNA molecule; and the secret, structural gridmatrix ordering and informing the braidmind. As its deliberate visualization impresses ideal-coordinate values of the braidmind pattern more deeply, an influence is generated through the third eye locus which reinforces overall reordering of hemispheric ratios in favor of right-brain emphasis, and nervous-network ratios in favor of the parasympathetic system. Internal visualization of the Pentagram's criss-cross lines, parallels the pattern of nerve-optics in the visual system; it therefore traces an ideal group and reinforces optimum, angular harmonics coded through the complex of the brain-mind (the visual system is the mindbody's chief"},{"pageNumber":788,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV sensory processor; the other senses and their systems are subordinate. Even when blind, the visual system continues to operate and process the other senses). Charge the image with Charger Breathing when visualizing it. Again, there may be a \"strategy\" required to practicing this without repercussion, if technologic interlopers already have access to your neuraVcortica1 systems through signature (verbal) brainwave pattems. The same instruction for varying direction, intensity, time and place applies here. Although at first the introduction of this \"uncommon\" cognitive pattern to your thinking processes might be \"noticed\" and draw suspicion, with practice it will serve to reorder braidmind ratios and conscious~subconscious systems in such a way as to enhance, and optimally reinforce, overall nonlinear current-harmonics-strongly modifying verbal identification-patterns and folding all such functions into a far more complex, elusive, subtle and elastically variable field. The procedural tracing of the figure incorporates a \"left-brain\" value into right brain imagistic processes; the effort to visualize the Star in totality at the completion of tracing, is a strongly right-brain exercise. [3] The diagram of the Hounds of Heaven should be visualized in totality, closing eyes and internally imagining the superposition of the entire image (in all its geometric parts and lines, with each of its \"hounds\" properly placed), in alignment with one's own head and neck--the \"hound\" at the top corresponding to a point parallel the top of the subject's head, and the \"hound\" at the bottom placed parallel the base of the brain. The lateral \"hounds\" should correspond to the actual placement of one's temporal lobes. After separately practicing visualized placement of the entire image, this key is to be used in a very specific manner; even prior to but especially when a particular class of \"disturbance\" is induced, the \"hound\" corresponding to the type of disturbance should be visudizd. One need not visualize the entire diagram, any other part thereof or any other \"hound\"; indeed one should fix attention Wy only on the \"hound\" most appropriate to the situation, imagining it at the location of the brainhnind to which it's assigned on the diagram. Visualize it the duration of the effect. The importance of this \"exercise\", is to impart a special instruction direct& to one's brain-wave pattems as a holonomic system; with the visualization of the diagram and its guardian \"hounds\", you are coding aparticular and special class of identity-signature into those patterns. The implicit \"instruction\" to your .braidmind pattems is that they themselves are to take on the specific configuration of these guardian hounds; and that the nature of these hounds, is that they bite! i.e., they sniff out, identify and detain with their sharpened fangs any energy-code which attempts to encroach by disguise. Your subconscious systems can identi@ and discriminate what \"you\" as the resultant, composite \"conscious\" system cannot. Your subconscious systems can distinguish the authentic from the counterfeit. And you are further programming them, through visualization of the \"hounds\", to attack and repel or powerfidly turn back on their \"owners\", any such surreptitious interloping signals, or furtive foreign radiation-patterns. In effect, you are phase-conjugating those signals, and bouncing them back down the very phantom \"thread\" of their trajectory. At the very least, you should give some Cray computer a terrible virus! This works faster than you might think. In a relatively short period of time (especially in conjunction with the first two practices) the least inkling of an \"alien\" stimulus will trigger-alert the appropriate \"hound\", even without your strict conscious participation; and the first brain-wave upsurge of that signature-hound should act by jujitsu directly on that \"heat-seeking\" signal sent to"},{"pageNumber":789,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1V greet one by identification, trapping it and locking on to it by precisely the mechanism of its own identity-correspondence to one's signature-patterns.

What can we really tell from brain-wave patterns? Do they describe us like the secret pages of diaries to which we've been given the key? Is everything that we are, reducible to the curves and squiggles mapped by an electroencephalogram? Or, are such patterns deceptive partial registries through clumsy contrivances, of complex processes in no way obliged to open an accurate comspondence with any set of needles that jump-in their characteristic way--to the presence of those processes? Certainly there must be more than an accidental or casual relation between the recording device and the processes recorded. This conclusion is granted by virtue of the recent history of biofeedback experimentation, in which we come to see that, not only do such marks appear in response to the objective dimension of a conscious activity but may be used to induce, control (to a variable degree) and regulate the subjective character of that activity. Thus there's certainly a connection of more than evidential value; such marks don't merely comprise incident impression of a disturbance like scorched trees from the passage of a meteorite in no way serving to reconstitute its identity, aside fiom testifying to the fact it was there (nor displaying any power to induce repetition of the phenomenon for observation). On the contrary, the patterns produced on the EEG meter, Mind Mirror etc. quantitatively register what may certainly have qualitative signifi- cance, in measuring and formally regulating the rich experience of consciousness to which they corre- spond. We needn't assume the reductionist atti- tude at all, in confrontation with the prospect of \"brain-wave measurement\" etc. We needn't fear that conscious processes will be manipulatively reduced to fluxes proving out the hypothesis of behavioral determinism on a graph; for, even where the behaviorists seek to use such patterns and their interpretations in this way, one of the factors illuminated by those years of experimentation is the presence of the mediating variable, the pivot"},{"pageNumber":791,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV on which all interaction between conscious states and quantifiable measurement turns--the factor of volition, the element of creative indeterminacy associated with the cerebrospinal or conscious axis itself. The modification of conscious states correlated with regulation of the so-called auto- nomic or involuntary processes, is irreplaceably dependent on the alertness, cooperation, quality of attention, degree of determination and coherence-of-intent demonstrated by the subject in whom such modifications are to be induced; all these factors represent nonlinear degrees of freedom in the centml value of consciousness, which in totality spells out the presence of will. How To Make A Zombie To be sure, the control-minded researches of behaviorists mordantly in love with their manipulative work, have certainly \"shown\" that will in a certain sense corresponds reductively to brain-sites, electrochemical patterns etc.; the genteel art of lobotomization (and other less-well- known but furtively existent programs of our behaviorist espionage fraternities across both seas) certainly seems to support a dry determinism, bringing rigid objectivists as close to joy as their passionless outlook would ever allow. And yet the celebration is premature, as a closer or initiated study of the feedback and biomedical literature will certainly show. Surgery and chemical alteration may mimic the scenario of pure \"roboticism\" equating the value of consciousness itself with manipulably mechanical processes; yet even the apparent helplessness of a brutally-modified mind unable to act with the \"independent\" or self-generating consciousness we associate with will, only demonstrates that the factor of will is hidden--masked by a bio-mechanical circumstance in which the value of conscious indeterminacy (definitionally comprising the being of the living subject) can only act in acceptance of an induced pattern, on a one-to-one basis, so that such a pattern efficiently perfonns as an uncontested instruction. That value of conscious indetenninacy informing the very, living focus of even the surgically-modified subject has been artificially deprived-& effect-of one of the mirror components of its operative process whereby it may ordinarily reflect any input through an equipotential contrariety of impressions made mechanically available as cancellating patterns through connective retrieval systems now fatefully impaired. Thus being in effect imprisoned in a circuitry comprising a single-phase mirror reflec- tively reinforcing the imperative impression, the conserved value of conscious indeterminacy (always present and equivalent to the irreducible factor of will) nonetheless can conceive no choice but to ratify the input which acts as a volitional suggestion from the \"outside\". Thus it's not that \"will\" is absent or excised even in these extreme cases of an invidious mechanical deprivation; yet its presence is masked by the apparent, deterministic or one-to-one correspondence between the given \"order\" as input, and the inevitable obeyance of the order as behavioral output. The \"active\" component of consciousness which we identify as the decision- making faculty of will, is \"folded under\" as it were so that its activity seems merely passive and will-less; actually it emanates through all the \"activeness\" we ordinarily associate with will, since the irreducibly indeterminate value of the conscious void-variable necessarily appropriates the dominating impression even in this case. It's just that its variabilitycadjustment can only \"focus7' on and activate the pattern received as a volitional command through the artificial imprisonment of the single-phase mirror brutally fashioned by the surgery or neurochemical manipulation.

All this dry technical discussion should be of passionate importance to the reader; for what it does, if understood, is give the definitive lie to the objectivist model, the thesis of behavioral determinism in which even consciousness and will are apparently \"reduced\" to biochemical equations and stimulus-response pattems. Understood, this discussion shows how will, mind, consciousness and ultimately \"soul\" may be hidden, brutally walled-up or temporarily (but not eternally) imprisoned in such a way as to be largely obscured, and seem indeed not even to be present as any sigdcant factor--and yet may be recognized as always present, irreducibly required in even the saddest performance of the compulsion-circus conducted by certain of those most-unfor- tunate beings possessing irredeemable slaver-consciousness. We Return Control Of The Dials Now back to the Bat-cave. What we've learned at the subterranean meters and dials over the years is that the qualitative experience of our being in terms of perception, feeling, cognition and attention as manifestation of the rnind/body whole, can be indicated at least interpretively by the quantitative magnitudes of brain wave patterns on a graph; and we've learned as well that these brain-wave pattems can be positively correlated with changes in metabolic rate, bloodchemistry, galvanic response or dielectric skin resistance and nervous system activity. We've come to learn that the level of awareness may be measured as a norm in the statistical average; and that such a \"norm\" can consti- a comparative base for identifying altered states of perception and awareness. We've come to learn that all brain-wave activity represents a mixture of operative waves functioning at identifiably discrete cycle-ranges; and that the \"normal\" activity of waking consciousness statistically portrayed, operates with decided emphasis on the so-called beta-wawe pattems which--in the measured norm---tend to overwhelm or \"mask\" the signals of the other co-functioning brain-wave levels. Only the most sensitive and diversified array of modem instruments detects the simultaneous functioning of the different brain-wave patterns at their respective levels. The range of Beta activity, then, represents a cognitive standard characteristically emphasizing hear thinking and the domination of abstract-verbal pattems. Beta corresponds to our ordinary conceptual level as sharp& emphasized and preferentially isolated. It is therefore easily equated with so-called left-brain activity. Its activation as an alert form of narrow, sequentially analytic focus demonstrates an ordinary correlation between betaneft brain activity and a functional dominance of the sympathetic (or excitatory) branch of the autonomic nervous system. Therefore a highly mechanical interpretation of these interrelated pattems suggested in the early stages of research that there was a necessary, one-to-one equation between betaneft- brain/sympathetic system activity. It was only with the later study (conducted basically in the last two decades) of altered or ''abnormal\" brain-wave pattems as observed in meditators and \"yogis\" and through the self-monitoring apparatus of biofeedback equipment, that a more sophisticated and creatively variable potential was reported. It was discovered for example that, through willed changes in forms of focus inducing modified states of awareness it was possible to significantly alter the operative ratio of brain-wave patterns so as to deemphasize the standard dominance of beta, and shift emphasis to the deeper"},{"pageNumber":793,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV wave-patterns of alpha, theta and delta (ordinarily viewed as \"minor\" or invisible notes correspond- ing only to weakly-intermittent and specialized states of profound relaxation, creativity and sleep). It was learned that standard functions of cognition and perception ordinarily associated with a virtually exclusive \"beta\" pattern, could persist in their active presence and with an even greater degree of proficiency under a wholly altered ratio of wave-activity, in which beta became recessed as & observable type while alpha and even theta patterns were drawn to the fore. Alpha is associated with profound relaxation and in particular with meditative states of consciousness; theta is associated with deeply creative operations verging on the awakened - - psychism and detected paranormal potential ofthe delta ordin&ly linked with sleep. It was therefore evident that the so-called left/brain functions could continue while integrated into a more gestalt level of awareness progressively identified with righthain emphasis; id that the operation of left-brain functions while linked with beta needn't depend on the exclusive emphasis of beta as in the observed norm, and so bore no true mechanical correlation with stimuli of the excitatory or sympathetic system. Indeed the deeper patterns of brain-wave mixture emphasizing the in- creasingly integral and relaxative func- tions of alpha, theta and delta also exhibited a proportional shiff in emphasis toward a dominance-ratio featuring the parasympathetic or sedative network of the autonomic system. Correlatively, in the \"medita- tor\" subject exhibiting the operation of this nonordinary pattern of brain- wave/newous-system activity, there's noted a marked decrease in blood lactate or acid produced in the anaerobic meta- bolism of glucose (metabolism per- formed in the absence of oxygen, as with strenuous muscle exertion). Lactic acid is medically comlated with tension-level; the infusion of lactate in the bloodstream of akod subject will even induce states of anxiety with no object. The decrease of blood lactate during monitored meditations is associated with increase in oxidative metabolism or the more efficient delivery of oxygen to the skeletal musculature; this in turn is attributed to the reduction in activity of the sympathetic system that secretes the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, responsible for selective constriction of blood vessels. All such evidence taken together suggests a medicdscientific profile reinforcing precisely what certain esoteric \"colleges\" as Southern Crown have taught for years without benefit of such strict confirmatory data, i.e. that a transformation in conscious states toward a net increase in awareness and creative efficiency of function relies on a critical shift in the normal operation of nervous systems, from a dominant ratio of emphasis on the excitatory or sympathetic (the reactive, fightlflight complex characterizing the functional norm of the enculturated global cross-section) to an adaptive emphasis on the sedative or parasympathetic."},{"pageNumber":794,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Such a reordered ratio of emphasis stressing the dominant function of the relaxative system through the subconscious nerve-networks, shows an obvious correlation with the axis of consciousness or the cerebrospinal nervous system. Alternate Polarization Of The Consciousness-Systems We may formulate the picture this way: the more direct, holistic, creative and volitional function of consciousness is positively correlated with a specific pattern of autonomic or subcon- scious-system activity emphasizing the parasympathetic process. The subconscious/autonomic nervous systems act in more direct alignment with, and therefore are more harmoniously integrated as functions of, the conscious or volitional axis when there is established a patterned ratio with emphasis on the sedative (parasympathetic) system. Awakened states of consciousness and more integral values of volition are, therefore, demonstrably identified with a specific range in the ratios of organization between sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the subconscious processes.

Winding 'round the subject once more: when thought-patterns function at a compara- tively low level of harmonic unity exhibiting dim/fluctuating focus in the waking range of awareness (bracketed by \"unknown\" parameters of the deeper brain-wave cycles operatively recessed), we may say the integral Void-value of consciousness is displaced or drawn off-side, functionally entrapped as a cognitive code configuring the frsunework of its identity through ratios-of-interaction polarized to viscerogenera of the frontal plexus. Conversely when the thought pattems are integrated at a high functional level of whole-value awareness operating through an emphasis of alpha, theta and delta cycles, we may say the autonomic processes are harmoniously aligned in an optimum ratio conformably stabilizing conscious Void-value into receptively alert congruence with its own axis, demonstrating in effect that subconscious systems are functions and integral harmonics of the whole-value Consciousness system (or vertical, multidimensional cerebrospinal channel). focus, surface apprehensions correlated with dominant fighdflight syndromes of the excitatory system.

We find in the decades of experimentation with brain-wave patterns that, the closer we come to \"quantifying\" reliable magnitudes of truly awakenedkreative activity the more surely we come into contact with the deep theta and delta levels ordinarily associated with unconsciousness and sleep (these levels are so associated precisely because they're commonly beyond conscious range of the beta-intensive framework and so are detectable only when such storms of emphasized activity are silenced in sleep). Thus the deep thetas and deltas are expressions of the dawning, operative value of a directly awakened void-consciousness, i.e. the totalizing value of the cerebro- spinal axis through which all cognitive patterns in whatever range are necessarily polarized. Yet void-consciousness, directly known (rather than indirectly employed as the central factor of \"indeterminacy\" in the fluctuating variables of willed action) is unmasked fiom its chronic cover patterns of lavishly self-symbolizing thought. It constitutes, for its own self-reflective mechanism waking up to its central value, precisely the Domain of the Unknown. Being intrinsically indeterminate, \"unset\", in itself not reducible to knowable pattern or learned program, it represents in its very approach to its own self-apprehension a questionable magnitude. It doesn't arise fmt of all as a certitude (since \"certainty\" had long become by default the province of repetitious familiarization) but as a Questionmark. And to the habit of long-accustomed consciousness, a questionmark is tantamount to Doubt. First of all then the levels of theta and delta verging on direct magnitudes of self-revealing void-consciousness, represent to the habituated levels of awareness a critical degree of uncertainty. They comprise the threshold of apprehensiveness, not-first of &--of happy self-recognition. This is the (otherwise inexplicable) reason why, when first exploring the new terrain of brain-wave activity, investigators early came to associate the erratic appearance of theta states exclusively with aberrant emotional episodes. Without benefit of the later studies of meditative consciousness, under ordinary conditions monitoring ordinary subjects investigators soon learned that the interruption of theta-states signalled bouts offear and anger, generally in accompaniment of buried or suppressed emotions, memories, anxieties etc. Why then later, when extensive monitoring of meditative subjects showed the significant participation of sustained theta patterns with respect to profoundly relaxative states, did there appear to be such a discrepancy with earlier studies of normal (non-meditative) subjects? What Makes Us Avoid The Void Initiated interpretation discloses the reason behind the apparent discrepancy, and shows that it isn't a discrepancy at all but a key--a key to unlock the answer as to what may possibly prevent us fiom achieving the optimum harmony of integrative nervous-systems stably serving the value of Consciousness. If, as we have seen, deeper theta and delta patterns represent the \"unknown\" threshold (as harbinger states of direct void-consciousness) then typically during the processes of encultura- tion when young systems attempt to establish stably reliable memory-patterns of what may be"},{"pageNumber":796,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"known\", impressions received in the course of learning interpretable as threatening to psychic homeostasis would by tendency reactively encode at the theta level-where first of all they'd be masked out of threatening relation with the stabilizing order of beta-wave patterns, regularly suppressed below the surface of reflective apprehension (thus theta would only tend to erupt, in \"ordinary\" subjects, under duress of emotional recollection etc.); and where moreover the threat- ening impression would be filed in the general category of \"unknown\", i.e. unexpected, unantici- pated, unwanted, unpredictable etc. Indeed this is why theta (and delta) associate with deep creativity; creativity functions most freely and profoundly through direct expression of the indeterminate or \"unknown\" variable. Therefore it may be inferred that the ordinary processes of enculturation (stabilizing norms of the \"known\") at the same time tend to post buried/subconscious guardians at deeplevel gates of the creatively straining Unknown, tailoring theta-amplitudes-that naturally lap the very beach of creative void-consciousness and all its paranormal correlates--into fierce repelling sentinels of reactive anger-forms, fearful praetorians of self-guarding denial. Thus the enculturation-process as presently practiced and parentally passed on, tends to be distinctly anti-creative. It sets up blocks by actually appropriating the creative wave (the \"amplitudes\" of void-value) and forcing it to serve as subconscious patrol-unit against itself. This should however tell us something about what happens when we contemplate the approach to an optimum, positive integration and alignment of the subconscious current-centers with the conscious axis (tacitly provoking the concomitant shift to right-brain, gestalt pattern emphasis and high-creative magnitudes of thewdelta abutting the void-chasm of the Unknown- investigators indeed now posit the appearance of theta and delta activity in healers as precisely a reaching out to incorporate the Unknown). We may see that, in contemplating this salubrious shift there's a lion in the way--a lion which is of course variably larger for some than for others, depending on the established degree of suppression and operative fear-reaction incorporated in the functioning psychic complex. Wherever the hint of that deeper magnitude of Being (corresponding ' objectively to thewdelta activity) suggests itself, for some the specter of the Unknown becomes immediately overwhelming, too much, and swamps the systems into wholesale reactive fear patterns. Which brings us to our title subject: Why Some Citizens of Gotham Fear Batman and Draw Reactionrny Cartoons About Him. Skulking Around The Unknown Territory Consider one who demonstrably operates on a more or less continuous basis through mixture of brain-wave patterns emphasizing theta with even occasional deep delta. Because such a person functions holistically from levels by definition associated with psychic forces and transper- sonal \"wavelengths\" of activity, it's more than likely even the most closeddefensive personality would sense something ... the vaguely disturbing presence of just that operative X-the-Unknown factor correlated with Theta etc. Indeed the reactive and syndromatically self-enclosed personality would probably be more likely to sense such supernormal value since in a way he'd be so negatively attuned to that level through the anxious monitor of fear. The deep-seatedfear sentinel would be quick to detect the awakened or directly-active presence of that uncommon value through the agency in question. But, being sensitized to such threshold only as subconscious fear-reaction, the subject would identie the active presence of its level in any given case only by that interpretive standard."},{"pageNumber":797,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The fearful personality could only \"intercept\" that presence subconsciously as a threat, a potential incursion fiom an Unknown territory. He would not only be deeply afraid to approach that territory himself; he would tend to dread and fear instinctively anyone subliminally suggesting to him the real, awakened Presence of that \"terrible\" value. And just who is it our fearful personality instinctively resists, recoils fiom and holds up the veritable \"cross\" to? Why, it can only be one fellow after all-for look: the extraordinary and harmonious integration of the full range of brain-wave patterns, Beta, Alpha and Theta, discloses the very uncommon presence of our old friend BAT-man!

That such a fearful and reactive personality clearly identifies the presence of an extraordinary power, one which transcends the normative level by leagues, is without doubt; for in his fear he communicates his dubiety to others by portraying the force he reactively intuits (through the alarming presence of BAT-man) as indeed an extraordinary agency. He doesn't portray poor \"Bruce Wayne\" as an ego dealing with sheer illusion; yet he necessarily depicts the power he perceives through the presence of the big \"B\" as a force alien and estranged, in precise parallel to the relation our alaxmist has with his own deep-level Theta patterns. He can't bring himself in his genuine fear to dismiss the felt threat as a figment, a chimera, so he portrays it the way he senses it through the self-alienated levels of his own being, i.e. as a monster devouring and completely taking over \"poor old B\", a huge fiery Genie perhaps, with one huge Third Eye singly covering his whole \"beetling brow\", hmmm? He draws up this fearful image, straight out of the reactions and vaguely jealous depths of his own psyche, and seeks to persuade all those open to the liberative awakening (made finally accessible and eminently available through the demonstrable presence of Gotham's good friend BAT-man), that his own low-level state of integration represents the measure of the world--and that the horrible monsters, the broken forms he conjures straight fiom his own psyche, are somehow correspondences of what exists through a Creatively Awakened Being in every way beyond his comprehension."},{"pageNumber":798,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV (Thank God It's Friday, We're in Safe during the Sabbath) Intro. to The Mother Book Bashar Review Magnum Organum Logos/Anti-Logos I, I1 will glimmer even into th' tombe where I shaIl lie, and I shall know that wisdome led me thus to wait unho- nour'd, as is meete, until in the perfected time,-which the Ruler, that doth wisely shape our ends-rough hewe them how we will-doth even now howe,-iny justifi- cation bee complete.

The teaching-representative of this third aspea is known as the MabaEhohan. Sigruficantly, Theosophy notes that the Ray ofIntcUigmt Artivity is at a bigbrr drvrlopmmtal point than the Rays of Will or of Love, constituting the product (residue or impression, record, mnemonic pattern etc.) of the previous mahpl or solar systemic round The implcatibnr of dur are not developed in the Theosophical material; and the obsrrvation is largely taken for pted without hrcher investigation or understanding of what it really means. Therefore a pregnant univmr of implication has gone largely neglected as to what this \"information\" actually holds for the ofices of those Beings responsible for stocking the contents of what ultimately become known as the Mystery traditions, and Who hrther the planetary culture as a whole. We may here sketch the implication briefly by noting that the cumulative memory-record of the Akash (out of which the multidimensional current processes ultimately organize the nested phase space of energy-fields generating worlds and vehicles of manifestation) constitutes a smd chanrrly in the keeping of which are all travails, triumphs, pains, dilemmas, realuations, rationales, records of \"profit and loss,\" of relative success and relative failure distilled and encoded from aeonic lessons in experimental combination and synthesis. Throughout this record in the vanable gradations of fluxing consciousness-forms is the general consciousness of the Mother; thus throughout this record is the consciousness of that which gives birch to you in the manifest fields, that which endows you with the operative tm of your appearance in the creative planes as powers of resolution. \"No One\" knows the sorrows of existence quite like the Mother; No One knows your travails, the depth of your crises or creativities quite like the Mother; and No One carries the burden of your sufficient alignment quite like the Mother. Ir's for this reason that there are differing \"lengths\" in the terms of Office held by each respective hctionary.

In contrast the Mahachohan. (a generally male) representative of the Mother, holds his particular Ofice much longer, i.e. it is the same cosmic Personality-expression Who incarnates life to life, again and again within the given aeonic round whenever the Time arises for that function to be refieshed The reason for this is that the Mahuchohan (corresponding to the Ray of Inulligmt hiuiry) must incarnate much more drrpb into the field of manifestation than do Ius related Counterparts. Neither the Minu or Bo&isathra come \"all the way into\" the field of manifestation when they're techrucally born, or take incarnation; they retain an extenuated connection or correspon- dence with the Spiritual Fields almost as though stmbing down into the zone of manifestation. Consequently they tend to hover around in appximarion to the physical form whlch they theoretically \"mhabit,\" they slide into general/loose congruence with three-quarters of the physical form yet seem \"reserved\" in allowing the psyduc portion of the soul-vehicle to descend very far into the lower chaka complexes or abdornxnal locus, \"completing\" the physical form as its \"feet\" This has been construed as a given feature of their (respective) functions; pious sentimen- talism has proposed it indicates their greater purity, the spotlessness of the Spirit provisionally \"taking fonn\" demurring direct contact with the mud of mat& being--genteelly recohg as it were fiom keeping coincident company with the deep coil of hndalini. It's seldom been seriously considered that such factually recurring condition hasn't represented a fured function of the Role so much as it's served as de facto index of the real operative dismpnry in the potential for Resolution between Heaven and Earth, i-e. between the Spirit of Whole-being value and its projective manifestations alignrng an average/perspectival hut of consciousness.

Just as the cosmic avatarstup of the Ulnu is responsible for cyclically injecting the quickening character of Spirit-light into the physical sphere so as to map+ the genetic, psychic, intellectual and spiritual potend of the planetary race as a whole; and just as the Bodhimma is responsible for the attempted mediation of and ultimate reconciliation between Spirit-light and the physical field (as the \"sacred heart\" or life of Love); so too the Mahachohan has a specific function in relation to those frlid offices: the Mducbohrn is responsible forfultbning the planetary culture as a whole, in terms of the intellectual and scientific spheres and with regard to the general atmosphere of guiding FnnpLs intluencing the given millennium of growth--and he does so as the Master of the adepts, who's therefore chiefly responsible for the osmotic influence on the more general exoteric cultures through his creative, guardian and regulatory function as keeper of the Sacred Flame of the Mysttty Tdition itself, the ongoing stream of the authentic tsovrir cultures. His is the Zoroastrian commission of cultivating an unbkm continuity in the progression of the samd sciences, first of aU and secondanly as they may reflect their guideline principles into the conceptual matrix of the mundane disciplines belonging to \"uninitiate\" culture as a whole. It is the Mnharbhan who either establtshes, or returns to regenerate the ebbing embers of, the sacred Schools of red Gnosis coexisting with the cornmonahty of planetary cultures and which variably permit their entrancegates to be perceived more or less brightly, more or less overtly dependmg on enveloping historical conditions, in quiet invitation of those probationers potentially ready ftom the larger-oblivious-society and so capable of catching the paning Veil. Love-Means to Wisdom-Ens There are several important features about this function whch aren't generally understood, even in the context of initiattd tradition (i.e. the \"theosophies\" etc.) but which directly bear upon the question of the greater longevity of Office and more deeply \"rooted incarnation of, the Mnharhohan. The Maharhoban's hction must be rontrasttd with those of Ulnu/Bodhicattw in order to gain a greater appreciation for the reasons underlying the ddferences. The nature of thefudm of Manu and Bodhisama, i.e. Spirit-will and Love, empower a particular styh of appearance with inbuilt tendencies uniformly oriented around the fact of thektatn enity of those filial Offices for the \"positive\" polarity or Heaven realm--the Self-congruent dwelling of Spirit-consciousness and the Gate through which Love issues. Indeed in the Cha'an/zen tra&tions of Buddhism there are two main principles borrowing their terminology ftom Sznskrit: one is prap (Wisdom) and the other is barurn (Love). Since Love/Wisdom is the prtrist characterization of the Office of Bodhicatma, the theosophical reason for classifying Gautama within that fiamework becomes immediately apparent. Karuna is a tm which gives the principle of Love a very sptnjr inflrtion; for in the context of this tradition, baruna (love) is a value referring to the givm mcans benevolently bestowed on mankind's initiates by its masten, the variou~ techniques or observances or practices devised with"},{"pageNumber":802,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the framework of any particular adept-admirustration for realizing the supreme aim of pap (wisdom).

This implrcs of course, though it's seldom been noted that they therefore ncccssarily bring with them much less an affinrty for the nature-patterns and vita-physical currents of manifestation. Their particular grfts of kam~ are therefore \"manifested\" with a particular character, an idenufylng seal. Both Mum and Bodhisnma exhibit only pussing concm for the inbuilt mechammu and codes of Intelligent Activity with whch the vital-physical and astral-psycfic fields are organized; the \"concern\" they chronically exhibit for the type of saucture, specific metaphysical \"anatomy\" and \"physiology\" as which the Mother-current of the dest fields has poked and patterned itself (as consequence of deep ontologrrrrl interpretations at the cosmogonic mot of thmgs) is really confined to determining within the Maze of that manifesting pattern the way in which the shest row bchvrcn h~4 points may be plotted, using the Mother's Body-map as the abstract context They do not exhibit particular concern, or even knowledge of, the quiddities, characteristics and peculiarities of that Body as it's lid by incarnate beings, with the particular iden+g needs and mind/body requirements It uniquely brings to the total Question-of-being. Thus the one-shot Officeholders in the categories of Father and Son, Mam and Bodhisama, tend by the very brmity of their offices as filled by a given PersonaLty, to demonstrate mrnGnal concern with let alone fosn'donfor the unique requirements and peculiar demands which the Mother's own madesting patterns bring to bear upon the pmirtmtly unrcsolwd themesf-being, through Her own mow anrirnt and dnulopcd memory-patterns or records of cumulative Logoic experience (remember, this fact is ctyfisscd in Theosophical literature without followthrough on the implications). ne Mam and Bodhisama, strongly referenced toward the Spirit-fields, whileyhaps- not so completely committed to total philosophical and practical tncnration of the Tree as the schook and disciplmes subsequently devolved by lesser practitioners from their Gutdeline Premises, nonetheless superpose a biasing tchology on that Tree in their own right.

The Mhrhohan's Work indeed presents the comparative standard whereby the Work of the first two may be productively idmt$cd in this somewhat different light; and at the same time it constitutes the necessary \"negative\" or complementary polarity, deeply enrooted in the physical field itself, establishing the opposite end through which the ongoing process of reciprocal adjustments and continuous, subtle correctives or counterbalances may be engaged up-and-back along the vertical (transdimensional) flowhes. Heavenly Handyman, Terrene Troubleshooter: Fixing Holes in the Holy Offices If as Theosophy says, the Bodhisatma is taught by the Manu, in turn the Maharhohan is taught by the Bodhisarrwa; each must then bring his own particular conmbution, unique to his Office, into relation with what has been learned so as to enrich the Whole. The MAuhohan learns from the Bodhkma that, at least in theory, the Purpose of the Whole process on a cosmic scale is to bring Heaven (or Spirit-light) into direct congruence and identity with Earth (or the nature-patterns of creative manifestation). The unique contribution whch the ahohan brings to the process, is in his ongoing and much-more-intimate assessment as to what of the Mother-pattern must be integrated and resolved (through those abstract considerations) in order to accomplish the ideal Unity in fact He's therefore much more concerned with the total mind/body pattern of creative destation (beneath the Spirit-light of Absolute-being) not in tenns of the potent& utility of its selective parts usem for synthesizing an expedient if speclalized Bridge but as it represents a very replete Rebus in itself, i.e. as that pattern secretly constitutes in its wholeness without selection or subtraction of elements a complete Equation-of-Being, an Inherent Wisdom-expression of the underlying relation and ultimate Identity of Creation with Creator. The Mahachohan is in effect interested in what the Mother has to say regarding the creation and the relationship of her fields to the Common Denominator of Spirit-conscious being. And he's inspired in his concern by an ongoing recognition, dmvrdjnrm the indispensable reqwirmrnt of living most deeply in the manifest fields themselves, that the replete pattern of those fields (and informing, multidimensional processes) encodes and expresses the punopts of ontobcal irnpcratives which emerge as the vny condition of Creative projection through the depth of absolute Spirit-being. Thus the Ofice and function of the Mabarhoban in a cmain sense conh'nw to ncprrrs and art on the lingering atmosphere of insufficiency, the residual feehg of died parts, neglected or denied processes bearing ontological charge subtly felt by the manifest field as a whole, and 9 the beings living consciousness through it, in the afcennath of Spirit-teachings which stoop haE-way into the darker dimension in order to show how to exploit certain features of the Mother (the physiochem- isay and electrical currents, the glandular soma and plexiform nature-wheels of the mind/body being) just long enough to qwingboard fiom interaction of their elements, and leave her.

In this sense the Mabarboban seems much less a pragmatist looking to fhd the utilitarian vantage 'round every curve of cove or seashell inlet (combing the lovely Isle only to gather sticks for floating a raft away from her) as he appears at times a scholar, or a thoroughgoing cataloguist developing the defimtive phylotuxy of the dest fields; but he appears so only because he is the greater investigator of those Mysteries distinctly belonging to the Isle, the jewel of manhestation Herself. He's much more concerned with the seaet of the total structure, the powers and processes wed to Fm and not really existent, or of hctional contribution, without the Form Since he's taught by the Bodhisattva, he inr~atlc the value of the Bodhisattva, in bis own context (i.e. awaLmui incarnative persistence in the Mother's realm); that is, the Mahachohan also looks for the appropriate kancna, the loving means whereby souls even buned in the Abyss of most-mated consciousness may awaken prajna--yet he interprets that object, fiom bis Logoic perspective, not simply as the prajna of awakening fiom captious fields of restrictive identiry-com- mitment in the condrtiond realms, but as the defimtive whd nsobction between the aeative patterns-of-being and the value of Absolute Spirit-consciousness. Thus the sum Persodty-expression incarnates life-to-Me dunng the given span of the Mabachohan's tenn, since the requirements of the office are of a different nature involving a much more-inainsicaIly----~~(mh character than the one-shot Persodry-appearances of Manu and Bodhisatma (concerned prnnanly with devising the most convenient colander in the moment, fiom the Mother's porous pares, suitable to srft the soul's effective correspondence with Their own relentlessly-upward polarization).

This means that in order to maintain a subtle connection or correspondence-of-Influence between \"greater\" esoteric culture and \"lesserw (though numerically larger) exoteric culture the uzbarbohan must tread the balance of a he interlocking or broad congruency of terms, never allowing the \"language\" of one to grow so estranged from the other that no possibility of intercourse ranains. This \"mandate\" is of course especially hard during those times in which the \"two\" cultures, exoteric and esoteric, grow bctionally further apart so as to seem no longer to have a common denominator.

On the one hand, then, we may see the Office of the Mihacbohan putting its \"weightw behmd what's perceived as the necessary trend toward philosophical pragmatism and the ascendancy of the secular sciences (and. indeed, instigating it); on the other we may note its continued cultivation, nourishment and regeneration of the scrnt srimrc $ thc soul propagating the pattern of irs progressive universalism or global hion of arcane traditions along parallel streams calculated to meet and merge in the ripeness of their respective developments, \"in the meantime\" having quietly grown together enabling a new pf08rrssivc pairing of their terms (i.e. hs, theideal-state of our pmt era at the end of a 2000 year cyde, which Bacon would have hopcd might see some such greater Intercourse and spiritual Conception between secular and esoteric sciences, since all the dusters of their coarse and subtle nerve-endings are by now obligingly rowed in potentially-idendable pairs). That such a dennial integration of material with spiritual knowledge can even be done, has been quesuoned by certain commentators (again, Mr. Wilbur gives recent example) invoking the spurious logic that science and occult disapline constitute two unlike categories never coming to any concord owing to dissimilar aims. Someone ought to dorm the federal government of h, certainly, since it should come as great surpnse to its secret scientific minions working for decades with principles and practices making Arthur C.

Those who persist in denying the ultimate identity of the two (again, the redoubtable K.W.) can only continue to do so by taking the grain of distortion left temptingly around by those greater avataric lights of the first-filial-Offices, parlaying the praeternad proclivity into a full fledged dogma befitting the trail of tagalongs closing in Their wake (vymg to catch reflected Glory &om Their passage): i.e. that dogma which does the avataric \"derence* one better in presuming the aim of spietrcal Reahation to be too lofry and altogether set apart by purity of aspiration, ever to be confLsed either with the ambiguous energy-properties of \"occultism\" or the related (though even more degraded-by-association) fields of the physical sciences themselves. The instance of hs latter presumption at least does us the favor of rcfiing the subtle and not-necessarily-noticed Inference inevitably issuing &om atmospheric tonc of both Manu and Bodhisatrva-presences when they appear; at least it does us the favor of crystallizing the \"amtudinal angle\" emanating &om those Spirit-born teadrrngs intersecting the ~h~sical sphere through chronically oblique perspective. so as to catch the tenor of \"superiority\" coming back on Echo when ir: outs in unsubtle form."},{"pageNumber":806,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Once Ny stated for us by ics knee-jerk commentators (no need to name an example) the falnty of the attitude becomes all-too-apparent.

The faa of M-term reproductive carriage in the case of the biophysical fd signifies a special akgnrncnt with the forces of the physical field- and the coded biopotentid of the female enjoys qdtatively different relationship to the coded biopotential of the planetary \"nucleus.\" The noted dearth of female \"adepts,\" avatars or spiritually-awakened beings in the course of planetary hstory has only been a fimction of \"patriarchal dominance and suppression\" secondarily; it has first of all been a reflection of the fact that all spiritual realization+xanplified thus far through the \"Earth-spheren+ been accompanied by a miduc, a left-over factor that refirses to go evenly into the equation. It's been a reflection of the fact that the mwh of \"realization\" in this sphere rests uneasy on the head of every ''reahzed being,\" since a resolution of the composing units in all their parts and problematic aspects has yet to be adueved. since no Awakening resolution between Spirit-consciousness and the whole of the Earth-sphere has been manifestly accomplished, so the products of planetary awakening thus far have been largely maL in gender by no ucidcnt, each mirroring and duplicating in microcosm that general off-timing in &e tables of things whereby F-3 imperatives (and thus all that which Form could teach regardmg the fill relation of the"},{"pageNumber":807,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV created to Creator) have been put on hold, effacingly recessed and forced to gwe unrequited wimess to sibling-Spirit's unripe crowning.

Where the uctualfrmaic gender bears the burden, as a bio-psyduc matter, of the physical field's uneasy relation to the potential of Resolving Unity with Whole-being value or absolute Spirit-con- sciousness, the female gender is less easily assuaged of creative-spirirual hungers lingering in belly and loins, less convinced or befooled by the abstract tidiness of Mind theoretically decoupled fiom Body and so less easily pressured into provisional edghtenment on the basis of mere ubandonmmt; where the female accepts such edghtenment much less easily, so the enition of such dghtenment is propomonately unacceptable and the (htorical) examples of biologically-female adepti dedtne toward nil on the negative arc of the curve. Where there's a scarcity of reaZ, biologidy-female adepti there is a concomitant drfinrnry in the degree of realization accorded the =female side\" of the spiridy-awakened malt adept, and so there is a nnl absolutc &kt in the ovd value of Awakening exhibited through the manifest/d physical fields. This has necessarily been a carry-over factor in the continuity of the Mabothohan's baion; while at the same time it's been almost uniqucZy the O$cc of the Mahachohan that's noted and thus tried to npoir such a fact (owing to the very nature and correspondence of the Office, being that of the Mothrr). The cyclcally-incarnating Mahachohan has been hampered in his efforts to compensate the difficulty prcriscly by the persisting fact of the historiral ubsmrr of the awakened Motbrr, i.e. a living female-gender embodiment of the true Mothrr function. (Those nominah) female who, throughout htory even to the present-day have been venerated as Awake in the form of Mother, have in practical fact served the same role in the same ratios-of-integral-hctioning as their male counterparts- there's been nohg truly unique to the MotWs planerary function, to distinguish them-f.

Indeed so acutely aware has the Mabothohan been of dm ongoing deficiency, that biblical history records one of the more humorous if grossly misunderstood (or disingcnnorcsly ~qmrtul) efforts of the incamacing Maharhoban to render a reasonable-facsimile for cducativc purposes, producing a veritable road-show dramatizing the significance and impact of the \"Awakened Mother-presence\" for the Phdosophical Parallax of the material-field, through a perfectly-unawake model! Despite such valiant efforts and little \"encouragements\" on the part of the Mabarbohan to \"get the show on the road\" so to speak, and produce the resolving factor by Awakening the uniquely-fmlr agency in her M/unmodified form, the general field of consciousness and the planetary \"alignments\" correlated with that field continued to restrict the very vehicle-of-reception required to make such an Incarnation possible. So inexistent in fart has that Incarnation of the Mother truly been, that the standard malt rrprscntation of the hrd-Logoic-principle of lnrrlligrnt Activity has been thoroughly taken for pnted and accepted as inevitable---indeed, though the Theosophical literatures of Blavatsky and Bailey make prophetic mentlon of many adept-incarnations and avataric Advents, there's a"},{"pageNumber":808,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV conspicuous absence of any prophetic Word, nor is there even honwabh mmtion re some imminent incarnation of the Mother! In all the Hierarchy literature, the potential Presence of the Mother seems to have been wholly overlooked (nor does it seem to be particularly loohdfor!).

The Maharhohrm has never had the supreme advantage, up till now, of being livraUy accompanied by the awakened-incarnate Presence of the Mothcr. The moment in the accomplishment of so unparalleled an event, necessarily signdies some millennid timing. The interests of every soul should be focused upon the meaning of such timing. How the Mother Reclaimed the General Function of Midwife, From the Specialists We've seen, then, the ways in which the hctionaries of both Offices of Mmru and Bodhrsathra have been interested in the creative field of the Mother's Great Body pnmdy as an insmental means, in praaice fashioning unique-even idiosyncratic--devices for expediting the alignment of souls with their savior-presence (in what amounts to a one-shot-only provision of that sacred koruna exemplifymg the characteristic spiritual technique of the gim avrrtarir nnbodimmt, at the gim tim). Though it's not necessady nod (owing to propagation of consoling notions re the posthumous efficacy of btlvf etc.), such avataric hctionaries normally leave no @ucious mans, of a universally-applicable type not reliant on the specrfic intervention of their parity-presence in the same plane, but rather leave Mychos or tales of their \"tanscendental pastimes\" of merely anecdotal merit-r worse, they leave a great gap where a religion can be erected It's for this reason, for example, that Meher Baba (an incarnation of the Manu for the present age--cf. Book III) has left a literame wondefi in its Insight into the themes, principles and powers of the creation and of the spirit--and yet his leftover exempIrf~cation of the Specific Path-of-reahtion theoretically constructed on the actual topography of the creative field, is so manijtstly specialized and applicable only to the mtr which was in use and good working order during his life that it almost wholly failr of any test in superposition upon other-viable--eta- topographes; it fails to account for the features of any other \"systems.\" and indeed many experimentally-valid paths or demonstrable spiritual cosmologies seem excluded on prinripl fiom the possibility of coexisting in the logical self-containment of the World outlined by the Avatar.

This susceptibilrty to perception as a \"man among men\" leaves the Personality of the Mahachohan rather uniquely subject to a wide variability in the regard with which he's held, both contemporarily and historically, so that he may be considered infmnow in a grven case as readily as he might be regarded jusufiably famous in another (Simon Magw is a case in point, hs aggressive humor and persistent/conf;rontati~nal demeanor--in expressing a fmctious prerogative of the Mahachohan's position--having been interpreted by Christian contemporaries and Catholic historians as evidencing his candidacy as premier Anti-Christ).

Thus Luna's incarnation was actually marked by the veritable withdrawal of the Psyche from physical congruency eleven years before his death, being principally Ovnshdowcd thereafter by the Identity/Mind hypostases-that same Psyche being \"transferred half-way 'round the globe from Israel to England to preside in integral \"supervision\" of the fetal and childhood development of Francis Bacon; at Bacon's eleventh year, the Oversoul hypostases were transferred over from the Person of the sublime Qabaist Isaac Luria, and the latter died This double/overlapping manifestation of the Mahachohan was necessitated by the Time (the Renaissance era), for the Mystery Traditions requtred a profound refreshment and renewal both East and West.

Not Quite bash in^ Bashar Bashar: Blueprint for Change Cross-examined by Monty Tyson Part I A large part of the otherwise fragmented New Age is still identified, if through nothing else, with the slogan \"You Create Your Own Reality\". This has been a constantly-reiterated theme, particularly of channeled sources, since its philosophical outline was suggested in the Seth material. It has become the conventional wisdom of the \"new age\" every bit as much as \"a penny saved is a penny earned\" anchors the conventional wisdom of the culture at large--and, we would argue, makes ultimately about as much \"cents\" (sorry-41' Monty must have picked up some of MT's more egregious habits). Just as the \"new age\" tends to be irreducibly identified with YCYOR, so initiated Wisdom as expressed in these T-Bird pages has come to be associated, in the minds of regular readers, with the contrary idea as expressed originally in the T-Bird article Vol. 1, No. 4 \"Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality\", by Morris Tarantella, and as magically illustrated for the general edification of a proof-valuing public in the \"Motto In The Lotto\" demonstration (Vol. 2, No. 1) and its expository follow-up \"The Big Spin\", Vol. 2, No. 2. Expansions upon and subtexts for that general theme have already been given in such articles as T-Bird Meets the Phoenix Part Three, Chapter V, Vol. 2, No. 7; On Ramtha, Bashar, Used Dictionaries and a Revised Peter Principle, Vol. 2, No. 9; and the sixth installment of T-Bird Meets the Phoenix only printed in the volume of Southern Crown's T-Bird vs. The Flying Saucers. Therefore we find no special reason to address those who have as yet so little acquain- tance with these extended expositions/demonstrations that they exclaim, upon encountering the contrary thematic Chorus raised here, \"oh, then you think people are just the subjects of random experience and forces outside themselves?\" It would behoove such people to consult (or reread! as the case may be in fact) the above Southern Crown sources in order to grasp basic principles underlying such \"contrary\" philosophical pronouncement, as well, as to get a strong sense of the ways in which the Mother-current teaching of Southern Crown enforces its precepts with clearly perceivable, non-ordinmy demonstration @recisely so there'll be no excuse for superficial presump-"},{"pageNumber":816,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV tions or uninformed dismissals on grounds which the SC adepts do not in fact occupy). Indeed Southern Crown adepts AAA and MT continuousIy demonstrate, for the reader- ship and for personal students, that part of efficacy embedded in the half-truth YCYOR while integrating it into its real context as a distinct feature of the demonstration. There is no good reason for people still apparently perplexed over the position taken here, to wonder at what might possibly be meant (or, as is most common, to~W in what they suppose must be meant). For the general benefit, we'll encapsulate the Philosophical Spirit informing the T-Bird's contra-YCYOR statement; for a more exhaustive analysis or detailed examination of the principles implicated in the summary, the above essays should be consulted-but they should be consulted not so much as a liberal education in opposite opinions, or simply for purposes of seeing what sort of account the SC adepts give of themselves, but in order to be minimally equipped onesevwith the means of measuring and critically evaluating the kickoff concept of You Create Your Own Reality. For that concept has itself either been dismissed outright, by those suspecting the \"new age\" of severe solipsism in any case, or it has been accepted uncritically merely because the bulk of its repetitive declaration has come fiom apparently extradimensional or \"celestial\" sources. To summarize the Southern Crown understanding on the matter, then, we may say that you don't \"create your own reality\" but rather model variable versions of \"reality\" within the context of, and in implicit reflection against, the informing standard of Whole-being Reality. As one should be able to tell in perusing the above materials, this isn't just a matter of semantics. The two positions have important philosophical and practical consequences which are not just the equivalent of each other. Indeed, they lead toward whole different worlds of implication according to the guiding footprints of their precepts, so it makes a great deal of difference as to which model is absorbed and assimilated. As we shall see, it isn't just a laissez-faire matter of rummaging around for the best philosophical \"deal\", of kly picking what personally suits you in a metaphysical Gallery of Egalitarianism where one worldview is as good as another. Rather, the respective philosophical positions bear greater resemblance to the doors in the tale of the Princess and the Tiger; it makes all the dzyerence in the world as to which you choose to enter. Since the differences between the two have long been generally treated in these pages and related SC literature, there has been perceived no reason to continuously address the same groundfloor questions and objections issued hm any first/casual encounter with the subject matter, or for those who feel they're owed a complete restatement of the explanations in their own right without exerting any effort toward understanding the available material. These, frankly, we find defending YCYOR without understanding very much about the idea at all, without being able to discuss its premises in the least, analyze its elements against conventional or \"scientific\" models or follow out its implication; they'll profess-at best--only partial or irregular realizations of its methodologies but will defend them without examination presuming their awn as-yet-imperfect mastery, and--indeed--mounting such reactive defense in the first place as though in the belief that \"siding\" with the (ostensibly-celestial) viewpoint will further %efiiend\" it, and elicit its additional cooperation. Rather than drag over the same preliminary ground again and again for such souls, therefore, we leave them to the minimum personal requirement of perusing the available material that has always been the criterion for advancing any further.

It's for this reason that we presently review the outstanding spacealien contribution to the general debate in the form of Darryl Anka's Bashar: Blueprint For Change, subtitled A Message From Our Future. Aside fiom the Seth material itself, this source is probably the most \"able\" at stating and defending the position. So it is in the best efforts at coherent philosophical exposition, employing a truly-informed treatment of themes, that we'll find the most substantial strengths against which to pose the contrary thesis (in the same way a \"heavyweight champ\" can't be proven till he's fought a W-class heavyweight..oh my, Monty, such violent metaphors; we certainly know why you object to the gentle \"celestial\" thesis ...) Indeed, on page 58 of the Bashar book, Bashar himself (or themselves--it's a collective sociaVmemory/complex entity, remember) gives the model for taking the proper gentlemanly exception to anything \"received\" from channeling entities or spacebeings that rubs the wrong way, or which seems to carxy implications either unsound or dangerous. He suggests \"sharing\" your \"conviction\" with that entity in the form of a letter beginning \"Dear Entity\". So ... DEAR ENTITY (by Monty Tyson) You say \"you create your own reality\"; but, as thoroughgoing as yourprojections from such initial premises might be, in all the philosophical exposition of your lively pages we don't seem to find real definitions of either \"you\", \"create\", or \"reality\". Now, we hear many Bashar- philes object already that this stickling insistence on firstdefinitions is just nit-picking; but you, dear entity, being a self-professed fourth density being know perfectly well that such basic delinitions are essential, are in fact the linchpin of the whole thesis. However we also know that, taking philosophical Launchfiom certain tacit assumptions or definitions necessarily embedded in the thesis, those root-definitions tend to emerge in outline as the themes are lavishly \"unwound\".

Everything being blank, empty, neutral allows you to extract fiom the circumstance the effects you desire by assigning to it the appropriate meaning. It is simple mechanics: positive meaning in, positive effect out; negative meaning in, negative effect out. \"...what you experience to be your physical reality in a sense is a combination of vibratory frequencies. This combination represents all the probable or potential realities there can possibly be. They all exist right now, right here at once. They form what can be called the background reality, so to speak. Not that there is any one 'reality' any more 'real' than any other. Not that there is any one truth against which to measure all truths, or other realities for their validity or truth. No, the background reality is the composite of all realities, all truths, in a holographic fashion ... lying in wait for a specific stimulus to bring to the surface of that general background any particular reality that you may choose to call a dimension of experience, or a universal realm. \"How you call those particular vibratory fiequencies to the surface and allow yourselves to experience that particular reality, is through your beliefs and attitudes, through the vibration you create yourselves to &...it is not so much that experience gives rise to meaning; it is that meaning gives rise to experience. \"...all circumstances are neutral. The meaning you choose to believe; the meaning you choose to create in life, about your life, is what generates the particular types of circumstances you experience. These reinforce, reflect and represent the meanings you are creating. Giving meaning is the actual act of creation itself! To give meaning to something is to create it into existence in your particular experiential realm\". So-we have a collection of the keylimportaut points of YCYOR right here, amongst which are the reiterated notions that all situations and circumstances are actually neutral, that there is no \"one reality\" more \"real\" than any other, or tnrth more truthful than any other, and that the act of injecting Meaning into the basically-neutral circumstance is the equivalent of reality-creation. Let's examine these ideas further. This is first of all a proposition of reality-creation; and that proposition depends deeply on the idea that all \"realities\" are relative and that no one reality is greater or \"more real\" than another. For Bashar, then, \"realities\" are necessarily the fields-of- experience, the given frameworks for cognition and perception which are born of meaning (\"it is not so much that experience gives rise to meaning; it is that meaning gives rise to experience\"). But wait. For anyone with a braincell turned on at this point, we've got a basic difficulty. Waiving any effort at dehmg \"reality\", temporarily, except through Bashar 's own premises, we find two definitions of thefield! of experience (which are supposed to support the whole definition of reality), and these two cannot go together (no, not even by fourth density bothhd logic). First of all the fields of experience (\"situations and circumstances within your physical experience\") must all be basically neutral for this idea of personal reality-creation to work at all. It must be upon this basic neutrality that \"we\" impose \"our\" meanings, and so generate the field of experience (\"meaning gives rise to experience\"). Yet if meaning gives rise to experience, the experience is born already injected with meaning. But it can 't be, because Bashar says experience is basically neutral, prior to meaning-endowment But if the experientialfield is already present in its neutrality awaiting the injection of meaning, we neither \"create\" it through such injection nor may we continue"},{"pageNumber":819,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV to support the idea that all our \"realities\" (allegedly produced through the act of meaning-endow- ment) are strictly relative to one another and there is no more \"real\", underlying reality. If \"reality\" is, by Bashar 's own definition, equal to the fields of experience, and the fields of experience are all basically neutral, then (1) we don't create those fields of experience already preexistent in their essential neutrality through bestowal of relative meanings and (2) there is a uniform and persistent character to all such experiential fields defined, by Bashar, as reality: and that is Neutrality itself: A Choice Reality-Or Reality Of Choices? Now we may turn to an explicit definition of reality; \"reality\", as everything else, is defined through contrasts and opposites, so that which is real is necessarily that which is constant, holds up under all conditions, is invariable under fluctuations or changes of state and persists in comparison to that which we define as \"illuso~': The value of neutrality holds up to all such definitions of the \"real\" according to Bashar's account, for all experientialfieldr and circumstances are \"basically neutral\"; what they are under all relative and contrastive modelings of \"meaning\", is neutral. So--is there no \"one reality\" which is more \"real\" than other realities? (Already we have myriads relative \"realities\" each with contrastive features, idiosyncratic properties and perceptual configurations; and we have a common denominator to such \"realities\" which, because of its invariance and homogenous uniformity under all conditions constitutes a definition of \"the real\" transcendent to the conditional features participating in it.) For one thing, the basic definition Bashar gives to the fields of experience is the only definition that can live up to the meaning of reality, if \"reality\" is to have any meaning at all--and that, by his own account, is not a meaning we inject into it but which we find already in it (this of course makes the \"neutrality\" of experience a noumenon; and we won't debate with Bashar at this point how one may come to Rnow and identi& such a noumenon to begin with, if \"we\" are tacitly defined as that which injects meaning--like a &-floating variable--into the field of reality thus \"creating it\"; rather we will show, up ahead, how you in fact may come to know and identi& such a noumenon without injecting the meaning \"neutrality\" into the field of experience-which would of course instantly make it a meaning amongst other relative meanings and thus precisely not what Bashar defines as a term persistent, continuous and uniformly true in characterization of all situations and circumstances beneath the fluctuating surface-projections of \"meaning\"). If we look around in Bashar's text we come upon more and more self-cited evidence belying his key hypothesis re the \"relativity\" of all reality: \"Everything is connected; everything is the same one thing.\" (Page 84) \"As long as you understand that you are doing what you are doing, that you are expressing the desires you are expressing through joy, through love, through light, through service, through integrity, there is absolutely nothing--nothing, nothing, nothing!--that that universe will withhold from you.\" (Page 86) This last string is a particularly telling set of qualifications: why indeed should the one necessarily follow fiom the other unless there was something intrinsic in those qualities ofjoy, love, light, service, integrity etc. that distinguished them over-against any other qualities or terms of meaning, and made them more efficacious than other \"equally relative\" and therefore \"equally real\" values? One could answer rather disingenuously and say that nothing really distinguishes these positive values from any other except the personal preference of the individual to experience joy rather than sorrow, cooperative unity rather than divisive differences etc.; yet where would such a personal preference come from, if \"in reality\" all quality-charges were equivalent? From the mere"},{"pageNumber":820,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV groundless whim of meaning-endowment? (Kee!p in mind that if \"meanings\" don't emerge in their differential values from anything actually truing a gyroscopic standard, then all meanings are equally arbitrary; being equally arbitrary, then no meaning can be anything more than neutral with respect to the totality of meanings and so can't be anything more, ultimately, than a mirror of the essentially \"neutral\" fields of experience. By thus dichotomizing \"meaningsw--as function of a free-floating variable-fiom the fields of experience \"without intrinsic meaning\" Bashar hasn't succeeded in making one thing any more compelling: rather, we're left with the mystery of two basic neutralities split down the divisive middle where only one was supposed to preside.) This implication should give pause, since, following out Bashar's logic the only thing that would distinguish values even he clearly identifies as \"positive\" hm values identifiable as \"negative\", would be the caprice of rootless personal preference. Worse than that for the internal coherence of his thesis, however: why should the one orientation (joy, sexvice, integrity) be grounds for such enthusiastic guaranteeing of success, such that the world can hold nothing back from you under its aegis? Why does this superior efficacy seem strongly to suggest an effective coupling to a type of \"reality\" clearly more aligned with a superior state, not at all just equivalent to any other \"reality\"? If we examine such preferred values, we find an innately preferential reality-type fiom the very beginning: joy, service, integrity etc. flow naturally fiom the ground of an underlying unity; they're necessarily expressions of a basic reality supportive of the mutuality of interrelationship, the essential continuity and integrity-of-being4.e. precisely that reality expressed in Bashar's corollary idea that \"everything is connected,- everything is the same one thing.\" Means To An Ens Doesn't something essential occur to the reader at this point? Doesn't it occur to the reader that this sameness of everything, the connectivity of everything and the integrayhomoge- nous quality of the whole is itserfa meaning? If it wasn 't a meaning, why should the values of joy and service and love and integrity have any self-confessed priority when it comes to eliciting the bounty of the world? If that underlying connectivity and integrity was a neutral \"meaningless- ness\" until endowed with an arbitrary application of meaning (by definition separate hm it), why should \"meanings\" like love and service allegedly superimposed over its unlike Ground have intrinsically-superior power in extracting the cooperative abundance of the world? If, however, we agree to recognize that the homogenous unity and integral connectivity of things is a constant factor of all \"realities\", we must recognize it as being aprior and superior realiiy with respect to all \"relative\" viewpoints drawn fiom it (\"reality\", remember, is a comtant, a perdurable value); and we must recognize it as not only the underlying meaning of the whole but the pivotal factor of basic orientation relative to which all \"meanings\" gauge, measure, adjust and contrast themselves. Yet, as an essential meaning it's necessarily innate to the field of experience, its common denominator; it is manifestly not imposed arbitrarily, as a secondary endowment or injection of meaning into that field. Nor can we simply say that this interconnectedness and \"same one thing\" is just a neutral fact until consciousness ascribes a meaning to it; this would be a convenience to many beings who'd like not to find any basic implication in the continuity of the field-patterns themselves other than what might be injected into them by volitional caprice.

We may understand it in this way: the functional variability of boundary- lines over the continuous ground of being immediately ensures that the most differentiated properties, of greatest contrasf are counterchanging equivalencies on a universal scale; the indeter- minately-extensive coinherence, mutual definition and reciprocal \"arising\" of everything with everything else imbues the whole with an essential identity, of part to part and of the Whole to its parts, which doesn't await on the injection of meaning into it but which is meaning. However: meaning is self-evidently a value of Consciousness. Note carefully-4ashar would have us separate the fields of experience from the consciousness-of-meanings, yet we see by our dysis that the implication flowing organically from the samenesdconnectivity of the manifest fields is one of essential identity. This spontaneously gives us a meaning to the fields as a whole. And, whereas meaning is (self-evidently) a value belonging properly to consciousness, identity is an original quality of Consciousness (cf. \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness'?\" for full philosophical exegesis on the subject). This however seals the \"two\" terms inexorably together, and makes one the expressive function of the other (the fields of experience and Consciousness). This is the jiather integral connectedness which begins to show the fissures in the philosophical edifice of the Sassani which-remember-would separate the \"two\", making them basically unlike in order to endow the consciousness-variable with a greater \"latitude of freedom\". Now, however, we can more clearly see how this would be a special and very tendentious definition of fieedom4t would make ''freedom\" the arbitrary pivot of a perfectly-groundless latitude of identification-options, amongst \"orientations\" and \"perspectives\" necessarily equal in their deci- sions toward unific or toward divisive perceptions-but as we've come to see, there is no equivalency between these two values precisely because \"homogenous sameness\" and \"infinite interconnect- edness\" in the charged coinherence and ultimate identity of terns biases the fundamental value of Identity toward a meanin- unity, a whole-being alignment or Conscious congruence through the variegated patterns of expression. This understanding makes freedom not so much an arbitrary option of alliance, but the inbuilt discretionary latitude (born of the innate indeterminacy of consciousness, appearing through the coordinate fields as the variable factor) for accepting or for rejecting the innate meaning-value embedded in the continuity of the whole. Moreover, since the variegated patterns of meaning are self-evidently oriented 'round, gauged against and contrastively paralleled with such an intrinsic meaning, the variegated patterns- of-meaning aren't separate from or independent of a \"neutral\" field at all! merely reflecting a series of god-like arbitrary determinations into it. All such meanings found in such patterns are conse- quences and expressions of an innate significance belonging to the fields of experience as a whole (i.e. as that \"same one thing\"). Here then we find an explicit refutation through the ground of Being itself, of the Sassani assertion that \"no situation has an inbuilt meaning\"; \"whatever meaning you give to a situation is what you have been taught to give to a situation.\" (p. 146) In turn, \"meaning\" is an essential value of Consciousness; therefore such Meaning itself gives the true integral relation between the fields-of-experience and consciousness. It doesn't inhere"},{"pageNumber":822,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV arbitrarily in consciousness; and it doesn't exist apart fiom consciousness. Yet it shows at a glance that consciousness isn't just the casual agent, the creator-by-fiat instilling meaning into streams of experience bearing no intrinsic relation to consciousness. But these logical conclusions grate against the purposeful cluster of conclusions to which Bashar would have us drawn; Bashar would wish us to tailor a tacit definition of \"You\" (i-e. the LC I ,,- sense), \"Create\", and \"Reality\", that necessarily makes \"you\" an independent consciousness- of-meanings over-against a neutral backdrop of experiential fields. In this way \"your conscious- ness\" is liberated fiom the implications of that backdrop so that the two are basically unlike; in this way your \"creative act\" of meaning-endowment is perceived as completely independent, and therefore completely capricious, making your status as god-like \"reality creators\" so much easier to countenance. This spares us the problem of perceiving any \"reality\" at all in the fields of experience, and shifts the lion's share of reality-endowment to the sovereignfiat of our fiee floating consciousness-of-meanings. Of course the origin of these \"meanings\" allegedly inhering in the \"I\" of consciousness is nowhere addressed by Bashar, but implicitly poses quite a pretty problem in itself (i.e. the question of \"who created these meanings\" is just as thorny as that of \"who created the fields of experience\", and leads to an unwanted infinite regress Bashar shies away fiom). And these specialized (tacit) definitions of Bashar's are all drawn forward at the expense of repressing contrary conclusions contained in the same materials, the obvious implications of which are never brought up. Besides \"meaning\", however, there is \"purpose\" (another word Bashar seldom brings up); and thepurpose in Bashar's leading his Earth-audience to such definitional conclusions at least becomes much clearer when we can perceive the implications contained in the various contradictions he quells by directing attention elsewhere. Let's see then if we can't fashion the Southern Crown thesis of Reality, Consciousness and Creation out of logical resolutions in the big bolt-bucket of contradictions Bashar has left littering the caw in his haste to get to the \"stage\" (if you know what we mean). The first thing we come upon is the value of neutrality ascribed to the fields-of-experi- ence as a whole. What that value is, and what its real relationship to consciousness might be, is a fundamental point to consider since we already know what Bashar makes of it; and we know that Bashar's philosophical vessel springs leaks immediately in the turbulent waters of this subject4e Sassani have indeed failed to come up with a philosophically coherent viewpoint on the matter. First of all, the Sassani would be hard-pressed to admit neutrality as a value-for that would immediately put it in the arena of meanings, which is the province of consciousness to begin with and not of the \"separate\" fields of experience. Yet the question remains, bald and unassuaged: whatperceives this quality of \"neutrality\" in the fields of experience? If consciousness (the \"you\" of the scenario) injects meanings into an essentially neutral field so as to \"create reality\", what agency assigns the prior value of neutrality to the field? Does consciousness (\"you\") look upon the field, declare it neutral, then decide to embellish it with an arbitrary overlay of \"meanings\"? Then the consciousness which declares the field \"neutral\" couldn 't have done so by fiat, by an arbitrary proclamation of \"meaning\" (since neutrality isn't a \"meaning\" in Bashar's sense, remember?) but only by an Insight (literally ' 'seeing into '2, an ability to discern the noumenon beneath the tissue of masking meanings."},{"pageNumber":823,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV If, however, by declaring the fields of experience \"neutral\" consciousness has deter- mined a noumenon, we must ask two questions: how does a consciousness-of-meanings (i.e. a consciousness with a monopoly on \"meanings\" collected to its side, over-against the blank field of experience) determine or assign the value of a noumenon prior to the ascription of meanings? And, why does such a consciousness, having discerned such a noumenon, apparently have nothing more to do with it? This is a deceptively important question. If \"you\" were somehow to fmd the underCying, single and infinitely untaing condition of everything, wouldn't you expect this supreme discovery to have signtfiance to you? Well, apparently it has no further significance to the Sassani, who turn immediately away fiom the \"basic neutrality\" of existence in order to paper it over with arbitrary color-patches of relative \"meaning\". Doesn't this begin to seem innately not right to you? What \"meaning\" can be ascribed to the fields of experience, born as such \"meaning\" necessarily is--by Sassani \"definition\"-from pure caprice or absolute/indifferent non-necessity which can yet excite your enthusiastic participation (even your joy, remember) in a pattern the essential being of which is blank, neutral, and furthermore which you identi@ and know as blankheutral? \"Well, Monty,\" we hear Bashar-potentidy--d~l~wer, giving him/his tribe the benefit of the doubt: \"the joy or enthusiasm lies in precisely our underlying knowledge that no weight adheres to our projected and provisional 'meanings'; it lies precisely in our uninterrupted apprecia- tion of the arbitrariness of our identity-commitments so that no disruptive element of delusionary attachment clings to them and we can quit them whenever we want.\" Now, Monty would not be so ungracious a cross-examiner as to put in question the Sassanis' ostensible \"pure detachment\" allowing them to dissociate fiom identity-pattern at will. The fact that they confess no ability to freely shift fiom their defining fourthdensity state, however, is hardly taken we of by the glib dismissal actually given in Blueprint, to the effect ''why would we want to?\" such answer merely amounting to the sophistry: \"I'm here, so obviously this is where I want to be.\" What's wrong with that, MT? we hear many chime-in already; there'd be nothing wrong with it if there was a behavioral consistency behind it, but there manifestly isn 't--since, if that was the sufficient standard for remaining in your present position (\"I'm here, therefore I must want to be here\") it would apply not just to the Sassani but to everyoneleverywhere, equally, and there would be no point in trying to teach us how to be elsewhere or enjoy conditions other than what are currently our obvious preference because we're presently experiencing them. But the Sassani do so try to teach us-which in itselfwouldn't be so bad if it didn't contradict the very philosophy they're espousing, for such teaching automatically fails to honor the tacit sufficiency and self-containment in the cited \"integrity\" that ought logically to characterize them first of all: \"...you have everything you need to be anything you want without having to force yourselves upon anyone else ...\" @. 108-109) By this we flatly state that their teaching isn't just the casual, we-don't-care-one-way- or-the-other kind they're professing it is, since very centrally embedded in such teaching is the strenuous effort to get \"us\" to accept and \"flow along with\" what the great majority are having a dzj?cult-to-impossible time accepting, to wit, our temporary \"detainment\" (don't say abduction, Bashar counsels us detachedly) by spacealiens with a penchant for performing elective surgeries!"},{"pageNumber":824,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV (their election, not ours). So, if Monty wouldn't be so ungracious a cross-examiner as to question the Sassanis' real quotient of felicity in flitting like faery-fireflies hm \"realityw-to-\"reality\" at will, Monty would still like to inspect this idea re the alleged ability to participate in an arbitrarily-endowed network of meanings while still holding in consciousness the liberating knowledge of the essential neutral-dispassion and blank indifference of all fields in fact. A Little Difference Between Love, And The Big Chill At this point we find that, even (most especially!) by Bashar's \"definitions\" the attested \"same one thing\" or infinite con- nectivity of the experiential fields is both the operative condition for, and the same as, the neutral blankness of those experiential fields. We won't argue this identity-indeed we'd like to go the Sassani one better and qlain the identity, which Bashar doesn't. The uni- tive continuity of being and the neutral blankness of being are the same owing to the fact that the counterchanging coinherence and mutually-arisinglglobal definitions characterizing the former, constitute effective cancellation of defining contours or differential \"charges\" for the latter, on an infinite scale. Due to the essential identity of these b'twO'' noumenal features, however, we've succeeded in multiplying by two the original problem found in the underlying integrityfmtercon- nectedness of being. If that underlying sameness necessarily constitutes an emergent meaning owing to its inbuilt implications, that meaning is--necessarily--a function of consciousness (Bashar admits to both terms, i-e. \"sameness\" and \"meaning = consciousness\", without admitting a connection). And, if sameness and neutrality are identities even by Bashar's \"definitions\", the quality of \"neutrality\" can no longer dodge the implication of essential meaning either, and therefore of essential association with consciousness. Just as the meaning of infinite sameness/intemnnectedness emerged as reflex of the whole-being Identity of consciousness with respect to the creative fields, so the significance of \"neutrality\" emerges only with reference to the consciousness comprising the Identity-value of all such fields. Due to this fact, however, we'll find that-like the \"sameness\" of such fields--the \"neutrality\" of the experiential venue bears a different significance to consciousness than that which seals its position in the Sassani framework. If the field of phenomena acquires the value \"neutral\", it's not because such value inheres in thefield ofphenomena defined by its constituents; it's because such value discloses the field of phenomena as a whole in its essential relation to co~~sciousness as a whole. If that field is neutralized, through the totality of consciousness, of any of its individually persuasive and affective impressions, it's necessarily because the unitive value of consciousness has ceased functional alignment and provisional identity-equation with polarized terms focused into contrastive relief through that field, and has (with awareness) relaxed into essential congruence with its own whole-being quality. This is the condition through which the phenomenal field is known in its function as the"},{"pageNumber":825,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV integral pattern of consciousness. Since the field of manifestation as a whole is apattern of consciousness, this means that its polarized charges and complementary processes lapse into an equivalency from lack of individu- atedkommitted identity-investment, not because there's no \"meaning\" in or through that field; the field continues to be bristling with potential meanings that don't at all inhere in consciousness over-against the field which \"in itself' is neutral--the field has no \"in itself' to be neutral in, since it's the expressive pattern of consciousness. The \"new\" neutral assignment of value to its cancelled charges as a whole arises as expression of the total field in relation to the totality of Consciousness. The \"neutrality\" of the field is owing solely to its relation to whole-being consciousness, and doesn't abide in the field at all. The neutrality of the field is therefore also a psy- chic event: \"psyche\" isn't imposed on it sec- ondarily as conceptual and emotional interpretation. As a psychic event the neutral- ity of the sum components of the field is equal to the unitive Identity of that field in, through and as consciousness; the value of such a unitiveiidentifying psychic event is a psychic value, ie. Love-the agective value of Unity. There's no neutral field and then a consciousness in which meanings inhere; for then consciousness would have to possess an internal pattem independent from and other than the field of manifestation or created \"hologram\"--a pattern which in its own right had complex parts with an additional questionmark hovering around them as to just where they came from. Bashar's viewpoint, if thought through, only introduces an additional complexity and afirrther problematic pattern which for some unknown reason we like to \"impose\" on the neutral pattern! No--the \"meanings\" still inhere as complex variables and encoded values of the manifest pattem, which are elicitedfiom their inhering condition whenever the focus of conscious- ness turns with intent into that field. Even maintaining unbroken awareness of Whole-being consciousness, that basically indeterminate Value may align itself through variable coordinates of its manifesting pattern so as to experience the qualities such pattern may disclose as representative expressions of consciousness, borrowing against its Whole-being presence. This is a very different situation. The meanings of existence aren't imposed arbitrarily, endowments of rootless \"fiee choice\" if only we but knew it; we come to a new understanding of the \"meaning of meanings\", we see the way in which the focalized pattern of expression yields its meanings as implicit disclosures of the &pee of congruence or inharmony, the degree of agreement or disagreement which the \"behavior\" of any cognized pattern innately models as representative expression of whole-being consciousness-and thus as gauged or measured in modeled integral-identity through the Standard of whole-being consciousness. Therefore things, phenomena, natural qualities and reflectively-intentional behaviors are not neutral in themselves, subsisting as basic blankness in the background independent of conscious- ness with its \"bag of meanings\", but are integral disclosures of relative compatibility or inharmony in representing just that relationship as patterning expressions of whole-being Consciousness. Therefore \"meaning\", as distillate of the complex and specific, exactly derives fiom thefield of patterning expression and not from consciousness in-itself--and it does so not as phenomena"},{"pageNumber":826,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV independent of consciousness but as a ratio of polarized interaction compounding a provisional representation (or dective symbolization) of the relation of that field to the whole-being conscious- ness of which it's expression. You-And-Me, Or-Is That You, Me? This, however, carries a universe of implication in itself, and places us at the diametric extreme of what the \"Sassani\" would teach re the ways in which we learn fiom, respond to and affect the world of experience. For example, Bashar gives a discussion (on page 1 13) which takes its point-of-departure fiom a generally similar understanding of \"process\" as that to be found in the above paragraph re the symboliclrepresentational character of phenomena-we may say that certain features of universal process which have long been discussed, analyzed and accounted for in the T-Bird pages and general teaching of Southern Crown show up also in Bashar's text, as they should if a shared universe of principles and functions indeed constitutes the basis for all accelerated insight-perspectives of the higher densities by common de$nition merging toward a unified ground. At the same time however, it should be apparent to the careful reader that similarly-iden- t5ed features are accounted for in different ways, embedded in different analytic contexts leading to differing overall conclusions as functions of very different worldviews. Therefore Bash begins by noting the same phenomenological principle: \"The idea is to recognize that synchronicity will bring with it the idea of symbology. Many times you find that everything in physical reality is symbolic of the actual interaction, the exact fundamental energy- exchange, that you are creating within your being...\" \"understand that everything you perceive in physical reality is a physiological symbolic extension of processes, bkmtions, which are actually going on, more or less, inside yourselves.\" Note immediately that here's a fundamentally important difference in the respective wordings. Bashar makes of this symbolization-process a reflection of \"the exact...energy exchange, that you are creating within your being.\" This way of expressing the principle is necessarily consistent with his guideline precepts re theprojection of meaning upon a basically neutral field of experience. The symbolization-process of that experience may only give you back a reflection of your own meanings, belief-patterns and ideas-\"the exact fundamental energy-exchange you are creating within your being.\" Right away, however, we see that this seems to give us two mysterious components interacting in a fundamentally mysterious way for the price of one: (1) the energy-exchange created \"within your being\" as a function of your ideas, meanings and belief-patterns and (2) the symbolic projection or overlay upon those energy-processes which (by such definition) can only give you a round-about reflection of something already primary, complete and interpretively open to direct knowledge in the first place owing to its exclusive formulation and inherence as idea (and idea's energy) in the subjectivity of consciousness. By contrast, we refer to our discussion of the \"phenomenology of symbolization\" given above, in which the same effect was accounted for in very different terms leading to very different conclusions: '\"Meaning', as distillate of the complex and specific, exactly derives fiom thefield of patterning expression and not fiom consciousness in-itself--and it does so not as phenomena independent of consciousness but as a ratio of polarized interaction compounding a provisional representation (or aflective symbolization) of the relation of that field to the whole-being conscious- ness of which it's expression.\" 811"},{"pageNumber":827,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Understood in this way, we see that the field of experience reflects potential meanings- for-consciousness; the meanings don't come f?om consciousness itself-consciousness itself is \"smooth\", undifferentiated, self-same, reflectively continuous and coincident with itself to the infinite degree; meanings on the other hand, it should be obvious, are distillates of the complex and specific and therefore not an intrinsic part of consciousness-in-itself, but a function of the relation of the fields-of-experience (in their ratios of compound interaction) with reference to the whole-be- ing value of which they 're expression. Meanings and potential meanings are modeled in that relationship between the fields of experience and the common denominator of whole-being consciousness. As we've seen, the \"neutrality\" of those fields does not inhere in the fields themselves, but expresses the global cancellation of preferential pattern or psychic charge through the fields as-a-whole with direct reference to consciousness-as-a-whole. Thus we find ourselves confronting an almost mirror epistemology to that of Bashar: rather than the fields of experience being neutral in themselves till the \"I\" of conscious subjectivity injects meaning into them, those fields receive their sum neutrality or self-totalling cancellation through that very value of Consciousness Itself, directly realized; and, conversely, the panoply of \"meanings\" can't inhere strictly in conscious- ness-itself, but necessarily emerges inthe interaction of compound focal fields with the Whole-king standard of Consciousness through which they're polarized. Following out the separate implications then, we see first of all how Bashar would have us understanding our experience, and the encounters we routinely have: \"It's not that you are not interacting with other consciousnesses, but anyone you imagine yourselves to be interacting with, in any symbolic experience, is generally the only thing you perceive in physical reality. It is your own self-created version of that individual with whom you are interacting, and you are creating that interaction in a particular manner4 a necessary manner. That manner contains any specifics needed by you to allow you to see in that other individual the things you need to see reflected back to you about yourselves. Thus always in that interaction you can understand that you are dealing with different aspects of your own consciousness.\" (Page 1 14) We see immediately that, despite Bashar'sproviso \"It's not that you are not interacting with other consciousnesses,\" we find no means at all within his philosophical context to realize that idea as anything but empty assurance. In fact, we're shtck, in the confines of his philosophy, \"dealing with different aspects of your own consciousness.\" Bashar would clearly have us accept the actual field of experience as neutral, i.e. bereft of \"meaning\" one way or another, and so simply functioning as a mirror throwing back upon us everything \"encountered\" as originating with ourselves, as symbolic messages hm ourselvesfto ourselves and thus inferentially of no value whatsoever in assessing the character of that which is experienced. It is clear that this is exactly what the Sassani is telling usif there's something \"there\" in the field of experience at dl, we can never know it for what it may be in-itself anyway, and can only know it as a solipsistic function of our utter reality-creation whereby all anything can ever yield to us is a symbolic self-image suitable for self-analysis and self-amendation. Thus if we're experiencing something \"negative\" from someone it's our own negativity (the actual field-of-experience is, according to Bashar, supposed to be neutral in-itself, remember?). In fact it is only our interpretation \"negativity\"; for all that we're left with are the self-interpretations flowing as consequences of the meanings we've injected into the scene. In this context there can really be no \"negativity\" at ail, either external or internal, but only an interpretation which--knowing this \"factm--can be suitably amended, i.e. changed by"},{"pageNumber":828,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the same sort of arbitrariness that initiated it, to \"positive\". Bashar Meets The Baal-Shem: UThou, Or Eye=I? We can see the application of this philosophy which our \"neutral\", disinterested and benignly-impartial &end would impart to us; indeed, a good half of Bashar's \"counsels\", both in this book and in his lecture-tapes, is taken up by a distinct encouragement to accept the current rash of spacealien abductions as \"in our best interests\". Since the field of experience is \"neutral in itself\", then any \"negativ- ity\", malevolence, ill-will, bad intent, adversarial character or even incompatible mood which the Earth-abductee may feel in the midst of his ordeal is @so facto a reflection of his own meanings, his own ideas, his own intents; any sense of \"evil\" is his own projection, mirrored back to him fiom a neutral screen of participants who can't be known in-themselves in any case but only as they activate his interpretations, his biases and his viewpoints. The implication with which we're clearly left is that there is nothing the abductee (excuse me, \"detainee\") can do for the duration, for there's nothing really going on in all the world except his subjective projection of meanings and the reflections of their consequences back to him hm a neutral field--there's nothing the abductee can do but change the interpretation, get with the program- certainly by flowing in consonance with it, he relieves the friction of misinfomed resistance emanating, in any case, from his own baseless meanings and moorless interpretations; he may as well convert the \"inevitable\" to apositive, since according to Bashar the universaJ \"synchronicity\" through which all experience manages to mirror to us our own meanings carries with it its own meaning (how did that get in there?) as to the impeccable appropriateness of everything that happens to us. Thus, if we're \"detained\" by bluegrey cousins of the Sassani fiom Reticuli who want to paralyze us, hmw and implant us, operate on us for indeterminate reasons and then extend their benefits to our families and children, why, it's all a function of the impeccable rightness in the synchronicity of cosmic timing, the only fly in the otherwise healthful ointment beii one's own domed interpretation of the event as frightening, uncomfortable and negative. We may extrapolate this contretemps on all the misinformed detainees at Dachau, and all those in present-day Sarajevo who are getting back to themselves their own projections hm the neutral field and woefully misinterpreting the synchronistic opportunity as a \"negative\" event Yet is reality just this sort of opaque screen projecting back only what we endow it with, in which every apparent being is just the occasion or unknowable point-ofdeparture for our own soliloquy with ourselves under the mistaken impression we are talking to someone in the room? Is the world just a case of Kantian agnosticism where the ding in sich can't be known in itself, but only through our projection-categories? Should this be true, then the persuasive impression of actually receiving something from another, of feeling in the presence and coxnmunication of another . the imparting of something-of-himself and not simply something photo-copied off one's own self-presentation, is a chimera-+ phantasm of fruitful interrelationship that just isn't there."},{"pageNumber":829,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV But from where does such a persuasive feeling come? Why should there be a distinct and rather universal feeling, a sense of essential enrichment from the real intercourse of nondupli- cate presences if there is nothing that corresponds to such a feeling in fact? We'd almost have to hypothesize a metaphysical demon, entered into the creation just to confound things a little more--throw in a red herring or two so it wouldn't be as immediately easy to come to the Sassani wisdom that the reality seemingly given back from another is strictly your own. However, if we review the Southern Crown teaching on the matter, we find that we can give proper place to such feelings, while acknowledging the mirror-effect to the extent of extracting use from it. First of all, the fact of consciousness (not \"your\" consciousness or \"my\" consciousness, but just consciousness) being a whole and homogenous value in itself without interruptive \"mean- ings\" or delimiting concepts characterizing its composition so as to degrade and partialize it, means that all things encountered will serve as potential reflections of its own presence to itself without anything being definitionally \"outside\" or \"beyond\" it. Thus we should be able to find anyone or anything, object, event, creature or person, manifesting a perspectival-impression of atype or quality that can be found in potential in ourselves (i.e. in the global indeterminacy of essential conscious- ness, without intrinsic content). We do not have to subscribe to some form of villainy as a meaningful model of ourselves, to find its potential reflected in us through the presence of others actually enacting such villainy. This seems apparent, but for Reality-creators such as Seth and Bashar there's no acknowledgment of anything beyond what is actively injected into the field of experience in the form of personally-held idea, belief, meaning etc. For them, all experience is strictly a self-descrip- tion in the narrow sense of conforming to distinct self-categorizing outlines. The logical implications that flow from this are, for example, that the assault-and-rape victim somehow drew it upon herself by-necessarily-active self-images as \"victim\", or by self-characterizing desires of the type which wound up exploding in extremis in her field of experience. Seth has actually insisted that a real couple brought to his attention, the victims of brutal battery and rape, invited such mayhem into their lives owing to their separate \"fantasizing\", the husband's of a voyeuristic type and the wife's of a multiple-ravishment type. But hold on, here-even if this were so, there are some unaccounted variables involved that Reality-creators fail to address at all; for example, if \"reality\" is such a sensitive one-to-one register of our meanings, moods, the inflections of our desires and the intensities of our beliefs, we must ask ourselves how many really have daydream fantasies which routinely include being beaten to within an inch of one's life, and having to watch the same or worse treatment bestowed on one's spouse? In such cases where reality-creators most especially like to allocate ultimate culpability, there seems to be a suspect disproportion between input and outflow, to say the least. And why is it our desires for a pay-raise never seem to result in the universe delivering up by mechanism of \"minor edification\" such whopping exponential magnification of the seed-thou& such as ownership of the whole company for which one works! From The Akashic Casebook: Just A Walk In The Park However, let's look at the same sort of example within the Southern Crown fkmework. Let's also examine a (well-known) rapelassault victim, from the Akushic inspection of initiated understanding. We'll keep in mind that we've already established one ground for the \"magical-mir-"},{"pageNumber":830,"pageContent":"ror\" effect in the idea that consciousness, being global or reflectively-universal, is charged with an innate potential able to resonate in identified correspondence with anything (symbolically) config- ured through the relation of its whole-being value to the phenomenological field. Let's consider then, a woman who hasAgrown up to value orderliness, regularity, the security of a well-paying business position, the health-potential and enhanced self-presentation of fitness etc. And she has made a logical universe out of these values, enveloping herselfin the regular orderly cubicle of her officewalls in the business district under the routine of which everything is predictable, controlled and proportionately subject to her proper skills. She values these traits of her personal inventory all the more because they've really been formed in reaction to her deep fear and distnrst of existence in general, since like every \"embodiedJJ being (without necessarily positing some special traumatic background) she's experienced the consequence of conditionality, of contingent interdependence through the shifting vagaries of mutually-modifiring circumstances which were never able instantaneously to adjust the temperature-differentials bothering her in the bassinet, nor get the bottle to her lips before the aggravation of her tummy set in. The Wmevitable contrasts, fluxing ratios and variable sensations of existence itself, in other words, were the sufficient basis of an initial psychic reluctance, a trepidation in the presence of life; such trepidation may have taken on specijic form as the psychology developed, and the abstract ambiguities of being settled into identifiably repetitious patteRlS characterizing her angle-of-experience with her sets of siblings and parents etc. But contrary to \"psychoanalysis\", the efficient cause as sifted fiom psychological contents is not the primary cause. Theprimmy cause is always the phenomenology of meaning which arises in the relation of the changing patterns of experience to whole-being consciousness. Ail such meanings emerge fkom that relationship, and do not come discharging into existence hm personal \"belief-patterns\" somehow formed before infknt consciousness has a chance to develop conceptual organs. Beliefs are complex, and require reflective assessment as well as the power of conceptualization4erefore beliefs can 't be causative, as Seth and Bashar et al. assert. (We may say that, in a \"Sethian\" style overview, coded belief-typologies fiom \"inca~152tional selves\" patterning energy-grids of the biophysical complex may serve to correlate the soul with a resonantly suitable environment; and they may be activated by tendency once aprepubescent latency-period develops physically adequate receptors. Yet they emerge as secondary dispositional response-characteristics toprimmyprocesses already charged with the basic meanings for which any given, conceptual outline is variable symbolic greasepaint mixed by the being in its interpretive progress.) Beliefs about and in relation to those original meanings are subsequently generated, but the beliefs are always compound and comparatively tenuous. They can be built fiom emergent psychological mechanisms of repression, projection and sublimation (following or modifying former tendency). As secondary structures, however, the belief-contents reality creators exalt are of constitutionally weak \"titre\" within the original/preconceptual meanings extracted through conscious reflections in the field of experience. So we may say that our subject developed beliefs which convinced her of the rightness of an orderly, predictable, controllable world; she developed beliefs which gave her the confidence such a world was in her personal grasp. Such beliefs indeed led her to experience the \"truth\", and the consequences, of valuing an orderly-predictable world. Such a world then becomes a talisman to her; it is the very, magical means of holding the disorderly world at bay, of locking chaos out of the cosmos. (We infer that these are subtle psychic equations in the belief-patterns, not forms that"},{"pageNumber":831,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV would be identifiable to her as distinctly self-conscious knowledge-recognitions.) The more secure, routine, predictable (and thus unevendid) her life becomes, the more she feels unlived potential pounding subliminally at her psychic door; the more such potential pounds at the door, the more disruptive it seems and therefore the more akin to the chaos she abhors. The more orderly she grows in retaliation, the more unruly the inward energy of that potential seems to become (this is owing to her true being as consciousness, which we've specifically defined as global all-potential without-in-itself-innately delimiting contents; as opposed to a conscious- ness-of-meanings which should extract fiom the world only the given meanings pumped into it as sufficient equations of consciousness). The more &y the energy of that potential becomes, the more resentful she becomes of it. It seems to haunt the peripheries-of-existence as constant, nagging reminder of that \"potential\" world, the world of unwanted surprises, nasty turns, unexpected impacts and instant deprivations which belief has specifically debarred fiom its catalogue of options. The more she senses those unfamiliar hands and fierce eyes moving in the shadows, the more they remind her of the manifest existence of act& conditions that are far from the ideal of her \"personal\" reality-inventory. Perhaps she should have been contributing more to those \"projects\", those t.v. telethons and charities so as to hedge the bet a bit moredeeping a manageable lid on conditions outwardly as well as regulating conditions inwardly. The more these reflections haunt her psychic margins the more ferociously she invokes the talisman of her beliefs, the more adamantly she af'firms the rightness of her life as chosen, the appropriateness of her interpretations. But those beliefs in the guardianship of personal orderliness (in the sufficient insulation of a life sanctified to predictable routine and spartan fitness without a trace of the suet that leads to existential messiness) are being imperceptibly strained by the unspecific--and thus all-the-more threatening-energy of that breakout potential. Those beliefs and those interpretations are, more and more, sitting over the bubbling crockpot of a need for reinforce- ment, for substantiating assurance, for a more decisive-validation. She begins to feel the pressure of a need for such validation or the additional secety of confirmation, so greatly that the subliminal mechanisms of her mind begin to work overtime organizing the scenario of a sufEcient validation without her being \"aware\", in the self-con- scious/knowledgeable sense, that this is what these mental promptings are at all. To her, they are just a semi-casual counsel to break the stultifying monotony of her office routine by forgoing the usual lunch at Four Seasons, and instead go jogging on her noonbreak in Central Park. As most of us know fiom the headlines, her talisman, taken out to the park to test its hypothesis away from homegrounds, failed. I Did That? How Powerful Of Me So where in all of this is her specific desire? where is her constant \"fantasizing\" and wishing for and brooding over the prospect of being set on by a wild pack of boy-wolves in the park? Where is her deep wish that collective rage be unleashed right in her face, her own fkenzied desire to be raped and unmercifully stoned into a coma? Do you not realize that this is precisely what reality-creators insist on, ultimately? Seth at least did us the favor of being very specific and straightforward about his assumption that this was so. (Why \"Seth\" should espouse this philosophy is a somewhat different proposition than why the Sassani, similar in diction and tone, should do so; for their \"teaching\" perspectives emanate from somewhat different angles. This will be addressed"},{"pageNumber":832,"pageContent":"later.) Wait, MT! our reality-creators rebound. Bashar has given us another means of interpret- ing such an event; we may say that our lady-jogger, assaulted in the park, drew \"victimhood\" upon herself precisely because she failed to notice her complicity, her participation and active meaning- injection through those events which, by synchronicity, so coincide as to bring forward perfectly self-reflective images that she's in no disposition to properly identify. She can't \"own\" these reflections because of her continuous self-conditioning that these are events out there; therefore she \"can't take proper responsibility for them\" even though she has controlling power as the causal agent! By negatively interpreting the synchronistic event as \"outside\" or apart fkom her own meaning-endowments, she experiences it in the form of \"victimhood\", as something which happened to her. But this gets to be vely disingenuous. What the Sassani has said here is just another way of positing the same script of active meaning-injections relying totally on the idea of specific commission (i.e. active desiring, thinking, wishing etc. inclusive of the specific/graphic contents which ultimately discharged as experience in the manifest field). The \"defect\" of her relationship to these ultimate reflections (of what must-4pso facto--be her own desires come-to-life) is only that she fails to identify them as such. This, the Sassani calls \"negative synchronicity\". By identifying them as such, she would take \"responsibility\" for the effect she was now receiving fiom her habitual thought-commissions. By taking responsibility for them, as her own fiat, she would at the same stroke cease her negative identification through them as \"victim!\" Her \"victimhood\" is only the effect of misperceiving her active godlike role in having generated this wolf-pack descent upon herself! Is MT maliciously or mistakenly representing the Sassani case? Read for yourself (Blueprint for Change, page 109). This is all that the Sassani is really talking about, beneath the camouflage rigamarole of \"negative synchronicity\". All which this \"extension\" of the reality* thesis really adds to the case is the idea that, not only do your experiences come back to you solely in the forms of the contents and meanings you've actively (and ultimately arbitrarily) injected into them, but you experience your own effects in the form of victimhood if you don't own up to that complicity! Bashar, and even Seth, have only given us the pseudo-philosophical version of the defense attorney who wins his case on behalf of the psychopath sitting in the defendant's seat by shifting accusation and culpability on the rape victim: \"She was begging for it! she wanted it! she must have desired to have this happen to her or she wouldn't have been jogging alone in the park!\" And yet people buy this \"new age\" business evely day, in perfectly good consumer fashion not really looking at who is selling you the bill of goods, what the product is really composed of or what its ultimate effects on you are! Rather, we find gushing endorsements on the inside bookleaf by Dr. Peggy Home, (Stress Management), by Anne Price (R.N., \"Healeryy), by Joan Bishop (Ed. DoZphin Dreams Newsletter) liberally praising the Philosopher-fkom-the-Skies who never shows his face, and who hands us back the old patriarchal saws in the formal sanctification of \"teachings\" taken to be \"new age\". The truth of the matter is, people don't seem to be able to identify a \"new age\" at all, but only the more familiar and thus comfortable fallacies of the old dressed up in a new package. Returning to our lady-in-the-park, we see that--according to Basharjhe's become a victim solely because she's failed to \"own\" these sudden experiences as hers, as what she's called"},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV upon herselfto learn from \"in a positive way\"--and how does she leam hm these assaults in a positive way? Why, by the vev act of recognizing that this is what, in the godlike hemeticism of her insular subjectivity, she has called down upon herself! By identiBing them as hers, she ceases to interpret them negatively; and the negative interpretation ceases because of the implicit and very specialized de$nition of negativi~ given in this context by the Sassani, i.e. \"negativity\" is that which in your experience is mistakenly identified as not yours, as not self-created. Thus the situation of her rape, stoning and maiming becomes positive automatically in the moment she takes advantage of the \"synchronicity\" and recognizes it as only a reflection of herself; of her own active desires, thoughts and expectations. For remember--according to the Sassani you cannot know what the \"thing experienced\" is in itself, just like the Kantian ding in sich which can't be lcnown behind the projection \"categories\". Therefore you cannot judge or decide upon the positive or negative character of the acts experienced, or the people with whom you apparently participate, in themselves-for in themselves they're \"just neutral\" (and never mind that MT has already demonstrated to you how the Sassani contradicts himself by endowing that experienced \"thing\"--standing behind your projective meanings, while functioning as a reflection-screen for them-with a tacit value, i.e. \"neutrality\", even though you're not supposed ever to how anything more about it than can be reflected back to you hm it). Pursuing the logic of \"you create your own reality\", you should not be allowed the judgmental luxury of bringing the apparent perpetrators to trial! What that event was in itself is forever unknowable (except insofar as we contradictorily concede an \"actual\" neutrality), and is only interpretable according to the meanings projected upon it by the experiencer. If she wishes to view them as \"perpetrators\", \"rapists\", a \"wolfpack\", and herself as \"victim\", well, that's her business, but there is no commonality of innslte meanings emerging fiom experience itself consti- tuting a sufficient grounds for evaluating the character of \"act\" or \"actors\" against a non-relative standard. Uh, Now Let's Meet Our Cohorts In Reality-Creation ... Of course, we can see how this interpretation of Reality serves the \"disinterested\" Sassani, sticking a collective-if-invisible face into this dimension so as to \"impartially\" help poor laggard humanity along toward a codification of its ancient fallacies into \"divine truth\". Bashar helpfully explains to us how he and his Sassani peoples are our \"future\" ancestry, the \"eventual\" product of the current furtive rash of abductions (\"detainments\") of humans by the grey-alien species from Zeta Reticuli for purposes of genetic interbreeding. For Bashar, the current \"silent\" crisis resulting in abductee support-groups and trauma-therapy all over the world is simply a matter of the Zetas \"bo~~owing\" genetic materials from the human species so as to graft upon their own stock a greater potential for emotional response, belonging to the more developed etheric-material patterns of the human heart center, which had been \"bred out\" of them over millennia of progressively degraded clone-copying. According to Bashar, the abduction-intercourse between humadalien species is to be looked upon as \"positive\", a \"good thing\" inferentially owing to the ultimate end-product which is the beaming (double entendre) Sassani themselves who--if we accept Bashar's lead--incorporate the best of both worlds, the greys' superior intelligence and the humans' superior emotional sensitivity. (For an account of this relationship fiom the point-of-view of Initiated understanding see the exegesis on the Andreasson greys given in issues Vol. 2, Nos. 4,5,"},{"pageNumber":834,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV 6 and 7 of the T-Bird, in the articles T-Bird Meets the Phoenix.) Understanding that the Sassanis' pending matriculation fiom 4th density to 5th depends very much on the sum-total momentum built upon convergentprobabiliry-waves feeding into the optimum \"intensity\" value of their collective present (cf. Vol. 2, No. 9, pp. 6-7 of the T-Bird), we can interpret Bashar's \"popping into\" this 3rd density hmework as an act some- what less than benignly impersonal, as a simple gesture of disinterested helpfulness. We may understand that the den- sity-advancement of the Sassani depends greatly on the criti- cal juncture of density transition toward which alI infeeding probability-waves converge; and that the Sassani is therefore very personally interested in the net-value and overall empha- sis of those probability-waves as they ultimately gather and crash on the shores of 5th density. It's for this reason that the Sassani \"saucer\" back in time to their earlier probable ancestral roots, to that critical juncture of 3rd stage Earth transition (moving toward a-40peful-4th density fi-amework) where, in the screen-lifting vulnerability of overall energy clung& and transdime&ional alignments the human population &comes unwittingly exposed tia more permissivefpermeable influx of spacealien civilizations £?om various times and places proxc&g their &vn special imperatives hm their own hmeworks,positive or negative (we now draw upon an independent initiated congruence between Southern Crown and the 6th density Ra mate&, which makes no bones about denominating density-bifurcation above the admixed 3rd density learning-hework as distinctlypositive or distinctly negative, thus infening that there is an innate gauge of evaluation and that orientations do coil about one or the other polarity in relation to the ontological standard informing the Whole). May we not now recognize that the promotion of a philosophy which encourages mankind to believe its experience (regardess the feelings received fiom that experience, regardless whether the experience seems to be that of a harrowing \"high-strangeness\" abduction and surgical infliction) is onIy knowable as a subjective intepretation reflecting meanings already injected into the result, has a dram of manipulativeness about it? May we not now recognize something a little less impersonally-benign and something a little more self-serving, in the encouraging extension of a \"higher\" (and therefore innately \"superior\") philosophy fiom our own \"future selves\"/densities which would insist we can only view the Reticulian activity as neutral in itself regardless the reactions and emotional rebellions we feel toward a prospect over which we seem to have no control? (Unless or until we accept the \"truth9\"t we have-absolute control over it by virtue of our all-creative act of meaning endowment, thus leaving it up to us whether we wish to nesciently characterize it as \"negative\" or own up to our creator-status and so imbue it with a positive value much more obviously \"agreeable\" to us.) Indeed that \"neutrality\" which allegedly lurks within the patterns of experience as their \"real\" character, takes on a new and very suspect significance when we realize that the Zeta Reticuli spacealiens are very ofen characterized, or experienced as, \"coldly neutral\" or almost demonically- indifferent toward their detained subjects, as if they were examining bacteria in a petri dish or specimens in a cage. Might it not be that the general encouragement toward accepting a background neutrality may have something to do with subtly reconciling the \"detainee\" to the very specijic sense of coldldetached neutrality coming not so much £?om reality in general as the alien-ambience"},{"pageNumber":835,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV in particular? Being subtly convinced of or reconciled with the '?ruth'' of a subtending neutrality (most especially sensed in the presence of the greys) is it not easier to convince that anything the subject feels of terror or violation, callous treatment or brutal indifference is an interpretive projection or emotional endowment of \"meaning\" on the blank screen not characteristic of the event itself or the ''thing as such\", but simply existing as a superfluous imposition that can be removed as easily as iron-on patches fiom a pair of jeans? Indeed, if this viewpoint of personal \"reality creation\" actually characterizes the Sassani perspective (while remaining manipulatively self-serving as an incidental side benefit, of course) then we must question the success of that very genetic interbreeding Bashar presently encourages; we must deeply interrogate this revelatory presence of our \"future\" cross-bred selves (or one probable variation of same), and ask how much more greatly benefited is the spacealien race \"emotionally\" having allegedly grafted heart onto itself by an objective surgical enterprise. We must ask how great a contribution that ostensible emotional expansion makes to the overall ratio of interactive elements in the cross-bred Sassani species when the dominant philosophy proclaims the fields of relative experience equal to \"reality\", \"reality\" equal to \"neutrality\", and \"neutrality\" a perfectly malleable blank background upon which fiee-floating arbitrary meanings-in-conscious- ness may be projected as a joyous enterprise of \"reality creating\". There is no emotional correlative in this; there is no empathetic correspondence. Ultimately we have the suspiciously same self-righteousness projected upon the subject of \"suffer- ing\" who simply isn't taking responsibility for her own freely created meanings, and so is being bashed in the face with them. We are left, in this \"superior\" philosophy, with no way of approaching either subject or perpetrator, for4timately-40th are our own projections, our own superimpo- sition of meanings with nothing behind but \"neutrality\". We can't \"heal\" the victim for we have nothing to say to her except \"why did you do it to yourself?\" in an endless ascription of culpability without remittance or remorse; and we can say nothing to the perpetrator, for helthey have violated no innate standard. We have nothing (but neutrality) against which to measure the mark of their \"act\", and so can only turn it again upon the victim and, in effect, tell her to quit whining! We're not allowed, by this philosophy, to find basic meaning in the underlying unity and interconnectedness of the fields of experience, because we're asked to diworce them fiom consciousness (which allegedly contains all meanings) and look upon them as a neutrality (which allegedly exists in itself apart fiom consciousness). Since we can find no basic meaning in the admittedly-innate reality of the fields of experience, then the interpretive meanings which con- sciousness elicits in turning toward the fields of experience can bear no innate relationship to those fields--and therefore can't exhibit an interactive educing of values through contrastive and comparative orientation to a common-denominator Standard. The activities of the boy wolf-pack transgress no unitive mmrdate of innate meaning through the fields of experience; they can't be interpreted in themselves (as opposed to being reflected in the subject's self-assessment of \"victimization\" etc.) since according to the Sassani they can only be neutral and so can't emergein their own right& evaluative relation against the uniform/homogenous standard of comherent identity. Thus say& the Sassani. Say ye also, o Man? If so, then we appear to have a visitation fiom our (increasingly inevitable) future bearing allegedly more mystic meanings for our \"new age\" which are nothing of the kind, but which instead reflect back to us our own 'kcientiic\" stream or specialized branch of thinking now swollen to"},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV preemptive magnitude, having \"gobbled up the world\" so to speak, shining triumphant upon us as the prevailing worldview into the indeterrninate-and indeterminately bleak-future! For our present scienhzc worldview tells us the same general things as we can sift out from Bashar's espousals: the world is really neutral, blank, indifferent, and therefore we can manipulate, probe, prod, pinch and puncture it with our own superposed, deity-like meanings without fear of reprisal from some innate value or inbuilf meaning pecuiiur to the fwIds of experience in relation to consciousness. Therefore we see that the Sassani are not the mystics, the spiritual vanguard; they're the logical extensions and philosophical upshot of the present scienhj5c worldview, to the enforcers of which they presently appeal (there's an interesting hidden relationship between these \"impartially benign\" visitations of Bashar, and the military-intelligence agencies of the federal govemment-or didn't you know that?) And they are the somewhat-more-buoyant but still basically estranged extensions of the grey-side of \"our\" probable joint-fdy tree, for the greys themselves are nothing but little...scientists, little emotionally-neutered manipulators just like the majority of guys in the government lab smocks, and the Sassani represent a future probability stream (not a sure-fire leadpipe cinch by any means40ugh they'd convince you of that \"fact\" by telling you there's nothing you can do, or ought to do, about the increasing spacealien \"detainments\" except alter your orientation so as to make yourselves authors of all you'd supposed yourselves the \"victims\")-a future probability-stream in which the \"scientific\" worldview in its present retarded sense has usurped the interpretive prerogative in the planet's developmental transition so as ultimately to divert Earthdensity progress into certain spiritual time phases of probability-emanation beaming back from original, ontological distortions and polarizing biases \"at the beginning\"4ese particular spiritual-time phases containing none of the subsequent corrections or mutually-mom- ing amendations which may be found in alternative probability streams of spiritual time, developed from more holistic potentials of Earth probability progression in the direction of ultimate Return. Drafted By The Down-draft These are considerations which are not generally familiar even to those who've been properly tutored in the preiiminaries of \"probable reality\" development by entities such as Seth (to whom we eternally credit--at least--that one service of drawing so significant a feature-of-being away from the hermetical province of subatomic physics and into the gend psychic field, where it may have practical implication for \"everyone\"). It's important at this juncture to understand, however, that there are additional complexi- ties to those few basic thmgs we're so proud thus far to have learned. While even the average \"new age\" reality-creator glib in gradeschool probability-talk ought to know by now that a horizontal forward time progression toward increasingly higherdensity states is at the same time a retracing vertical return in reverse spiritual time toward primary Ontological Origins (or the initial Creative fields out of which all descended planes are polarized), it's time such rudimentary learning was advanced a notch by adding that this escalating density \"return\" can itself be either relatively progressive, or relatively retrogressive. This is something about which even Bashar is not liable to be so loquacious. And how can that be, Monty? we hear the \"new age\" chorus ask ever-so-sweetly. And, the request being advanced with such politeness, Monty can't refuse the diplomacy of a properly- modulated reply to the effect that: if the \"progressing\" fools aren't watching where they're going"},{"pageNumber":837,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV they're bound to back right up the staircase of \"spiritual time\" into those same grooves and pathways of projective errors or original distortions still-and-eternally issuing as echoing reverberation on the way \"down\". We may look at it in this way: if the horizontal forward-time progression (e.g. \"our\" moving toward the projected density-transition of approximately 201 1 etc.) were visually rendered in its corresponding, vertical spiritual-time movement in the form of an escalator at Macy 's, very few would make the mistake of backing up the down escalator to get to the second floor; converted to these easy-to-understand terms, most people would reasonably go with a more harmonious order of vertical movement and take the up escalator. But when density-progression from the \"lower floors\" (i.e. 3rd density Earth consciousness) to the spiritually enriched upper floors (4th density, 5th etc.) in vertical retum through cosmogonically-inverse \"time\" isn't so clearly portrayed for the edification of overall soul ascendancy, anything \"vertical\" is liable to seem pe$ectly equivalent and a ride will be readily hitched without any recognition of the fact that one has coupled to a probability-stream very greatly involved in the rippling downward issuance of original ontological \"errors\", misgivings or misperceptions through which very many of the manifest fields were generated to begin with; and that in so ascending there is a proportional quantity offiiction in the resistance between disparate directions of movement in the vertical Line rendering a characteristic quotient of energy-loss--in a kind of inbuilt, spiritual inanition-& dogs the effort of groupcon- scious ascendancy eventually requiring it to have to have recourse to curious patchwork practices, stopgap measures, backup rewiring and wholesale rethinking (e-g. such as backtracking hm \"future\" to \"past\" to supervise certain mechanical amendations, as the Sassani are doing now). Understood in this way, it's easier both to detect the extravagant discrepancies in what the Sassani counsel us and what in fact they're doing, and to analyze the reasons for the disparity. For while on the one hand they're proclaiming to 4th density-hopefuls of humanity that \"you're as powerfid as you need to be to create what you desire without hurting others\" @age 90) and \"you have everything you need to be anything you want without having to force yourselves upon anyone else to do it\" @age 109) the Sassani are actively participating in and encouraging mankind's compliance toward the manifestly damaging and violating business of grey spacealien abduction, implantation, impregnation, surgical alteration and psychic traumatizing of Earth-beings! This is not an unfair assessment. Take a look! Why don't the Sassani turn around and tell the greys \"you have everything you need to be anything you want without having to force yourselves upon anyone else to do it?\" Why don't they counsel thegreys how their ostensible genetic deficiencies or relative lack of a functional heart center is simply due to the belief-pttem of personal meanings they've injected into the field of experience which in itself has no such merit or demerit? Why don't they explain to the greys that their problems needn't entail \"solutions\" that encroach on other lifeforms and types of consciousness which, even if they've ostensibly made some subliminal \"pact\" in some deeper dimension of their own being beforehand, destly don't accept or \"relate well'' to the experience when it crosses the threshold of hypnotically-dredged consciousness! (Has it occurred to anyone who completely buys this \"subliminal pact\" business that the limit of functional Earth-conscious will is necessarily drawn at the threshold of sleep, since 3rd-stage volitional consciousness is defned by its waking focus and manifestly hasn't developed into a 4th-density condition where it may function, as voluntary agent, through a defining spark of awareness struck in the \"astral\" or dream-state? With what responsible zone of Earth-conscious will has the grey alien struck this \"subliminal pact\"? Is there an equity of available conscious"},{"pageNumber":838,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV intention in that zone?) If at this point the Basharphile objects that these aren't inherent encroachments but only our interpretations and that indeed it has been Bashar's constant benevolent business to counsel us as to how to productively interpret the \"detainments\" (e.g. by changing the very terms we use to refer to them) we rejoin immediately with the whole of our Southern Crown demonstration given here-you cannot so easiiy and arbitrady change the significance or sense of what you're receiving from the \"background echo\" of your experience precisely because that experience does generate intrinsic meanings with respect to whole-being consciousness. It is not a simple matter of some spiritual palimpsest that you can wipe clean at will, changing the meaning and significance of the characters inscribed there. The feelings and intuited emanations we receive through experience have an innate validity very much prior to any beliefs or interpretive conceptual meanings we ascribe to them. And again, this is precisely because the whole of the manifest field with its variegated properties and differential charges is \"neutral\" only with respect to the totality-o$consciousness; their resolving equation is then express& a psychic value giving the necessary-innate relationship between consciousness and its creative fields, as Love. Thus anything arising as conditional representation of that informing value within the manifest field is, in itself; implicitly modeled in relation to--and by contrastive relief against4e totality of whole-being consciousness. In this way basic meanings emerge from the field of experience through gauge of the whole-being standard of consciousness, and cannot escape such primary-irreducible significance. Thus \"evil\" and \"good\" are not just arbitrary labels, interchangeable on whim of will. They refer to a true relationship of behavioral correspondences and preferential modeling with respect to a constant ground, that of the Whole-being standard of Consciousness through which the creative field as a whole is eternally resolved in Love. We receive something real from people and events in our experience, something which bespeaks a tmth or validity about them every bit as much as it reflects a potential of our \"own\" consciousness, since all behaviors and occurrences are generated with gyroscopic/implicit reference to an informing Standard that even Bashar names, though he tries immediately to strip that name of significance, \"neutering\" it as it were--and therefore everything arises as an index of correspon- dence generating a direct-intuited sense of greater or lesser conformance, richer or poorer congru- ency with the truing Value of that Whole-being standard. Therefore rather than belying and, as it were, shaming the testimony of abductee-wit- nesses by attempting to dissuade such testimony of its innare validity or convince it of its own, fallacious interpretive disposition as an instance of \"negative synchronicity\" (setting the subject up for his own self-inflicted victimhood), we ought to pay closer attention to the general consistency in the tone of collective testimony. We should honor the validity of such testimony in its own right rather than trying to dissuade it of the very sense of innate validity, thereby estranging it from its integral background so as to make it easier to accept an arbitrary and artificial grafiing of meaning onto the situation. If it were really a matter of a fiee-floating magneto-board of arbitrarily exchangeable meanings, then the occasional persuading of a \"victim\" that he's not a victim but a sovereign reality-creator able to change \"negative\" to \"positive\" at will would have no lingering after-effect and, indeed, there could be no such thing as the psychological mechanism of repression where displaced symptoms and compensatory projections pop up all over. But there manifestly is such a"},{"pageNumber":839,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV mechanism, meaning there's a consistently valid backgroundstandard against which all experience takes place that can't be arbitrarily erased, negated or denied but only shuffled around, masked, disguised and otherwise distorted by rationalized overlays so as to discharge in disturbed form. This can be seen clinically in the cases of those who have been \"persuaded\", by reason or by hypnotic suggestion of the greys themselves, that despite the strangeness and discomfort of the experience the beings \"have our best interests at heart\". Almost invariably those who've been cajoled or mind-molded to such testimony exhibit a distinct vacuity, an observable blankness themselves as if every pause in their speech pattern were a literal lapse through psychic lame- and they still break out in cold sweats through the nights of their marginal sleep. Yet there are still professional rnanques all over the hall who bow without excuse of subliminal coaching or spacealien hypnotism, before the bizarre Bashar syllogism to the effect that \"you create your own reality\" because: you naturally desire what's best for you, don't you? Wes, Bashar); and the grey spacealiens are arriving here as your benefactors to engineer a genetic improvement in your human species, do you understand? Wes, Bachar); now, since you desire what's best for you and the greys are here to give you what's best for you, you obviously attracted them into your reality framework as a fke creative act, thus demonstrating to you that you're the reality-creators you'd all along hoped you'd be! (Oh, yes, Bashar). And the only thing you need to do to make it perfect is admit to your Godhood, concede to your divine creative nature by placing apositive label on this result you've drawn to yourselves, rather than shrinking in fear hm it as if confessing you can't nust the greatness of yourself being revealed to you (Oh, thank you, Bashar!). Conjugating Cosmic Parts-Of-Speech (Logoic Probability-Stutter) Initiated understanding would concur very readily up to this point with the run of \"reality-creators\" in noting that, through the indispensable requirement of probability-fields there isn't just a higherdimensional reality with a higher truth innately valid owing to the \"perspectival height\" alone; there are, necessarily, many alternative versions of a given density's \"reality\" owing to the proliferation of probability-patterns under stress of branching hypotheses, of diverging orientations and mutually displacing \"fiontier edges\" of collective psychic thrust. Initiated understanding recognizes the general existence of a pulsatolyfIow moving up and back through the strata of densities and thus moving both forward and backward in time, waves of implication carrying original worldviews or patterns of principal Assessment (fiom primordial depths of consciousness) as to just what the nature of the whole might altogether be. Initiated understanding identifies such cosmic current-process as a loop of transdimensional feedback--an interpenetrant winding of coded implications flowing as potential influence fiom one system to another, contributing proportional persuasions in the configuration of systems and continuously met, coming and going, by reflections of itself adapting and incorporating as a kind of reciprocal modeling across-the-board. Understood in this way, we may see the \"past\" of one such system influencing the \"future\" of another, or conversely we may see the flowline of influence proceed fiom a relative \"future\" form of consciousness to a relative \"past\" form of consciousness; the distortions, biases, angles and inflections of interpretation that pass back and forth through--and in formation of--cosmic systems or densitysrganizations do not therefore possess invariant time-signatures (i.e."},{"pageNumber":840,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV as a one-way linear progression) nor do they possess rigid causal labels, e.g.jFom cause to effect; rather they originate as ontological potentials, differentiating perspectives or original orientations regarding Being and bubbling forward hm the bed-of-Being which therefore make their appear- ance in and underlie the patterning systems of innumerable \"regions\", or density-zones, regardless the positions of b'time\" or \"place\" in the multidimensional flowlines organizing them on a relative scale. From the viewpoint of initiated understanding, then, \"we\" as the Earth-receptor may receive teachmgs which seem to emanate from \"our\" future and therefore--according to the format of density-progression-from a state of consciousness necessarily advanced upon our own, to be respected for that fact; and yet such a \"future'7 self or civilization of selves sending signals of psychic influence temporally \"backward\" toward us, may represent a certain cross-cutting of conjugate forms (pulsed fiom the common core-of-Being in \"all\" spatial and temporal directions) carrying interpretive orientations indicative of very \"early\" understandings, ontologically speaking. Therefore in constituting vehicles of reception already imprinted with characteristic eqectations coded into the very kinds of questions asked, we may intersect some fieldlstateldimen- sion of being temporally in \"advance\" of us and even linearly progressed in terms of density-de- velopment; and such a field/state/dimension of being may cany infonmtion-codes seeming to confirm our orientational tendency by filling in its outlines, furnishing the completion-curve of its rough cartoon so that4 a third party objective observer4e mirror-conformant spell woven through relativistic \"reality-creation\" would appear operative and airtight. Yet it would seem thus sound as the format of a viable ''philosophy\", capable of being transported fiom one context to another like the physicists' \"rigid rods\" only as long as the model was observed in isolation. Such classic pool-gazing may reflect a particular image by preference, but in drawing back the isolation- lens of our third party observer to embrace more comprehensive scope we perceive many another cosmic pool, many another cognitive wateringhole reflecting dzflerent implications, diEerent sets of properties which could eqdy be drawn upon according to the principle of correlative response if the point-ofdepartme wasn't of the essential narcissism that requires only its own features blown-up large and Cosmicized in strict self-substantiation. (Reality-creators \"create their own reality\", therefore, because they do not ask for a reality greater than or beyond the confines of the \"known\", i.e. their own selfanfirmatory features-ot because \"that's all there is to\" reality.) The given field/state/dimension-of-being drawn into the purview of the terrestrial \"reality-creator\" constitutes in itself one of many probability branches along which our tendrils of connection might have twined, and so it represents one potential sfream of development investigat- ing along a particular ontologicd line of inquiry, ultimately coupling itself with some whole-stop integral orientation of conscious Self-assessment ensouling basic themes from the origination-zone of Being. It might very well have received the Influence of that prevailiig orientation (ultimately locking into place as the density identity-pattem), fiom even higher-dimensional forms of con- sciousness; but--and this is something which is not so well understood yet must become progres- sively well-understood--the \"higher\" densities or dimensions-of-consciousness do not just represent our linear \"future\" as we perceive it on the horizontal timeline of physical cognitions. A higher density or dimension indicates at the same time one which is in progress of returning closer to the ontological origin, the cosmic root of original distortions or seed-interpretations; and it may represent a comparative \"nearness\" to the ontological origin which is truly Progressive, or actually"},{"pageNumber":841,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Retrogressive. Who Is The Autogenous One This may be understood in assuming the Initiated viewpoint that, in the dawning (ontological) moments of conscious differentiation there were inevitable misunderstandings or skewed interpretations displaced from full identity or spiritual congruence with Whole-being value. It may then be further accepted that the undulatory shocks of such interpretive sets were the information-geometries of meaning emanated into expression as coinhering/counterchanmnp ech- oes up and down the dimensional flowlines, in formation of basic \"realities\" keyed to versions of those interpretations. Finally, it may be affumed that Existence debuts as a confabulating matrix of interference-pattems working countless mind-modulations of those meanings all of which sprang up as reflective correspondence or interpretive parallel of that Ground. Therefore in approaching the original Ontological (or whole-being) ground we may suspect two basic modes of that approach-4.e. retrogressing, in more perfect \"recovery\" of the original distoTtions as ifthose distortions were primary truths in themselves, and therefore irreduc- ible; or progressing in the sense of advanced creative use of the intermediate zones-of-being as systems of reciprocal adjustments, equilibrating correctives and whole-being integrations so that \"return\" along the upward arc to the highest-octave Ontological Beginning effectually adds something to the State, imparts a true udvancement in terms of the Consciousness presiding over all comings-and-goings through the Gates of that Creative domain. We must ask ourselves in contemplating such communication as that received from the \"future-self\" probability stream of the Sassani civilization, what real position in the complex interference grids of forward-and-backward cosmogonic ripples and echoing wave pulsations the consciousness-form might occupy. We must inquire first of all (honoring thepart of truth contained in YCYOR) whether the communication received isn't a reflection beamed au rebours, in horizontal time, of a backward-tracing stream on the-verticaljpiritual timeline drawn into our hework precisely as an amplified tendency or \"future\" logical conclusion of our present dispositions, uninspected philosophical presumptions (e.g. the dominant patriarchal and general scientific worldview) or idiosyncratic seed-bed of meanings--in which case such communication would, in effect, echo back to us our own general distortions/misconceptions overtly unfolded and exponen- tially magnified as a function of density correlation into a full-blown Philosophical Universe all the more easily identifiable to us, and acceptable by us, owing to unacknowledged identities between mirroring cultures in the timestream. If, however, all we were receiving back was basically a progression on our present distortions and undigested \"philosophical\" misinterpretations, simply Writ Large and sanctioned in Formalized tenns, we'd have to greatly suspect we'd been met by a branching probability-vector having long chosen the unwitting course of moving up the down escalator; and we'd have to understand that by strengthening our overall connection to that probability-stream through increas- ing acceptance of and concession toward its \"offerings\", we'd be locking our future-propelled probability advancement toward the higher densities into fateful congruence with it so as to necessitate the same general, abrasive adhesion against the wall of backwashing tide in a probability pattern incorporating-while codifling-all the Original errors, as if to offer the Source's own sores back to Itself in inflammatory form.

This clearly expresses the idea that who creates the reality is precisely the issue in question, that it's not a settled account, that the upshot of the inter-cosmic dialogue (or logomachy!) has a great deal of bearing upon one's ultimate orientation to reality, how reality is approached and accepted, one's eflective quotient of love, creativity, responsibiliq and integration with the Crea- tor-source as functionary of whole-being consciousness ...

Reviewing Exhibits In The Timespace Gallery As our newly acclimating, 4th density-lenses become accustomed to perceiving in the starry \"dark\" of the Cosmic sky, the first vague patterns and sketchy glimpses of thoseprobability- $el& taken-with the enthusiasm of gradeschoolers---to be \"all there is to it\" begin to fill in; the richness and actual complexity of their interference grids reveal a meshwork of ideas stretched across (and indeed constituting) the myriad planes, densities and dimensions crystallized out as provisional \"settlements\" in the continuous pulsation of estimates and echoes issuing up and back all along the Line fiom Beginning Principles, in mirror-comparison ripplings of infinite cross-cor- relation looking to resolve the spiritual account as to just what the Whole ultimately Is. And so we see there are many interesting interstices, dimensional pockets and compound runnels creating courses of some continuity where ancient moods, early conceits, later amendations and consequent questions come to conditionally cohabit and generate unique \"models\", in variable ratios, representing new wine in old skins or the same sauce in an updated decanter. Thus we find the same or similar propositions having been given out, beamed lightyears and indefinite densities away and then trawled with the casting-net of a remote-future time returned in scarcely recognizable form, a deep sea species vaguely familiar and happily corroborative in many of its parts but \"evolutionarily\" modified a million times in the odyssey of its chance encounters with other--- known--species out there in the starry immensity, with their own eagerness to imprint a modifica- tion in the genotype that gives those distinguishing marks ... So it is for example that Bashar can tell us we may find our most readily demonstrable example of the YCYOR proposition in the afer-death State, where \"you will know you chose everything you experienced in that life, and thus you can create any other type of reality...\"; \"that"},{"pageNumber":843,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV you are a thought-foxm in a world of thought forms, and thus will usually experience whatever represents the &ngest beliefs you had in life ... \"; \"that whatever (you believe) at any given moment, even on that level--and especially in a sense on that level--is what most quickly manifests and realizes into the experiential reality (you are) having.\" Note: \"especially in a sense on that level\". You bet, Bashar, since that level is precisely the timeispace counterpart to our spacetime density about which we've already written (Vol. 1, Nos. 3 and 4) in the context of discussing the precise derivation of many of the YCYOR models currently beamed toward us (including the whole of the Seth material). It's precisely through this afterlife timespace respite, in what we've denominated the \"astral antechamber\", that the soul retires into its auric cocoon--and all the images or perceptual impressions experienced during such interlude are accountable as dream-slide projections on the walls of its psychic envelope. The soul's experience bears a kind of one-to-one correspondence with the stream of thinking here, simply because what's experienced is solely a projective outpicturing of the mem- ory-record; there's nothing in the astrally-formulated picture of \"experience\" which isn't already a content of the cumulative memory-impressions of the life just lived. The thoughts which arise in this quasi-dream state tend, at such a threshold juncture, to be rapidly churning response- patterns from the reserves of acquired traits, characteristics, personal interpretations and expectations describing the mnemonic profile of the dearly-departed, as that consciousness recoils and rebounds and is lured into successively manifesting symbols of its own, standard reactions toward a general disorienting turbulence and initial unaccustomed \"vagueness\". Out of this basic ambiguity in the afterlife dream-medium (indicative of the psychic milieu to which the soul withdraws its energy-sheaths) all the identifying \"typologies\" of the personal orientation-to- life are spontaneously manufactured in defensive compensation and so all the familiarizing \"props\" and comforting ''fhiture\" of the accustomed thinking are set in place. Here the soul \"chews over\" its typifying scenes, composite versions of its chronically repeated life-patterns, until the monotonous sameness of such \"personal reality creation\"--reflect- ing only the static meanings already distilled-4s a self-reflective spark of dawning dissatisfaction ultimately enabling the soul to recognize the bare fact that indeed it's dead to that former life, now just a record in the memory-files. After this watershed event of disenchantment permitting progressive dissociation fkom exclusive/hypnotic congruence along the wall of the auric \"cocoon\" (helped or not by unnoticed \"astral guides\" encouraging such awakening hm the screened sidelines) the soul may exercise the additional magnitude of self-reflective consciousness thereby gained to explore the characteristic plasticity and thought-form responsiveness of the astral (timespace) milieu. The immediacy and one-to-one equivalency in the manifestation of projected thoughts or intents, however, is precisely identifiable under all circumstances in the afterlife context as a consequence of the essential vacuity of the state. As an exploration of the symbol-types of one's own interior contents (showing \"rapacious\" notions for the wolverine forms and serpentine signatures they are etc.) there's astructural minimization of the potential for intercourse, few porous places or permeable transition-junctures where openings in the psychic capsule permit the sensing of presences functioning on coordinate-alignments not \"one's own\".

More to Symbols Than Meets the \"I\" Indeed, even the bare symbolic contents of the memory-impressions, projectively modeled for \"holographic\" inspection in the timespace state, ought to suggest to the soul's philosophical organ the evident fact that thinking/desiring/intending do not truly take place in vacuo . against a neuwndifferent field as the Sassani would have it, since even in this basically non-relational insular milieu the very manifestations of one's own solipsistic seed-garden of standard thoughts possess an innate element of surprise; one comes to variably model the plasticity of one's projected thought-forms as a function of the additional and unexpected dimension which that very symbolization draws forward. The overflowing associations and connotative halation of elements embedded in a given symbol immediately grant it a larger significance than the bare meanings one would ascribe in apersonal assessment of one's thought-content. The symbolizdion of the thought imparts shades, overtones and implications which the ego-psyche, left to itself, would scarcely see or concede to. But this means that one's thinking, desiring and intending take place with reference to a zrue informing standard; there's always more in and to the \"thought\" than the personal meaning could itself measure, ordinarily, since the given thought is generated as a tacit formula in the resolution of a continuous-4f unnoticed-orientation about a whole-being ground. This is what all thought actually is; therefore the specific feeling tone and pigment-ace- tate of its symbolic projection through the \"astral\" or dream-psyche necessarily carries this intrinsic co11110tationsf-values into evaluative expression. One's \"innocent\" hope for another's well-being pops out asaali'y in betrayal of its true form as a lurking jackal of predatory self-interest (perhaps even masked hm any recognition-as- such in the ego-soul's lifetime), now glaring back to psychic perception as a choplicking cur of opportunism knowing how to pocket the windfall profit of a fiend. Therefore even in the timespace/etheric-araal milieu we find no real support for the YCYOR thesis no matter how \"instantly\" the thought is met by its impressional counterpart through the plastically-responsive medium. And as we've seen, general subtraction of the real relational enrichment that otherwise occurs when the soul functions in enabling instrumental alignment with faculties opening directly out onto common ground (as in spacetime field-configurations like the one you're living now), is precisely what presses the afterlife-soul toward increasingly greater degrees of awareness; the deficiency of the non-relational context gnaws holes of subliminal dissatrsfaction in all its privately- projected scenarios so that the psyche progressively calls for the tutorial help that may be established in real relationship with inner plane guides, with reflected magnitudes of oversoul consciousness etc. It's important to note, then, that there are many and diverse types of qerientid ground owing to the cosmic shuffling and settling of interference-harmonics up and back into various reality-versions through the densities and planes; and thaf owing to the overtone echoes and resonant synchronies passing forward and back without rigid respect of linear \"sequence\" there may seem"},{"pageNumber":845,"pageContent":"to issue the same philosophical assertion fiom separate zones, or diverse density-backgrounds.

Thus it has too-often been taken for granted that the afterlife stage of 3rd-density timespace proves the case for personal \"reality-creation\". It does no such thing. Wherein We Learn That Correspondence Doesn 't Equal Creation In returning to our primary example of the Central Park assault-subject (we don't say \"victim\", you know), we see then there is no necessary correspondence of personal desire with ultimate effect, or between habitual concepts and manifest experience. We see also thaf by empathetic correspondence across a common ground constituting a unitive standard and mutual reference-framework, it's possible to \"grade\" or assess the behavior-patterns of the boy wolf-pack and project an evaluation which is not jurt a reflection of personal beliefs that can't \"get to\" the neutral reality behind which (according to Bashar) they forever hide as \"unknowables\". Note that it is precisely the ground of an empathetic correspondence that allows us to"},{"pageNumber":846,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV do this! The ability of consciousness (previously pointed out) to reflect all perspectives, possibilities, potentials etc. enables us to move empathetically and immediately into a potential presented to us in the fonn of \"another's\" behavior, in direct assessment of its real comespondence to the mutual reference-hmework of our Whole-being standard. Thus without judgments that inevitably issue from our personal inventories of opination, we may know, understand, assess and yes even rule upon the behavior of another without shrinking into the subject-shell of selfdoubt forever fM that we only project on others what is scandalously true of ourselves alone. Well, Monty, we hear a lot of disgruntled reality-creators challenging about now, if the ''Central Park assault subject\" can't be said to bear correspondence to her violent experience through her own typical thought-contents or desires, you must be saying her relation to the experience really is arbitrary and accidental, leaving us perilously close to the frighteningly-random world which Reality-creation, at least, wards off with a sense of personal puissance (i.e. no matter the actual discomfort involved in the event visited on you, at least you invited it on yourself'!). But no, Monty rejoins, we've already seen the way in which the violent experience does not bear just an arbitrary relation to her. Her original sense of the disturbing contingency-of-being (necessarily acquired by all, in some infantile fonn or another, owing to the mutually-modifying restlessness and ceaseless reciprocal displacement of everything) was met by subsequent assump- tions-of-meaning propelling her to tailor a trim and predictable life, all clean edges and safety-seal- ing. We cannot say she failed to take responsibility for what she perceived as the thteatening randomness of existence; on the contrary she took specific responsibiity for it, by performing a sociocultural and yuppie-tribal exorcism of upscale intensification. Therefore it is not in her fiutive desire for some contrary \"ritual debasement\", nor is it in some fw-predicating perception of the \"animalism of others\" that she attracts to her the ultimately-explosive experience. For her sense of the metastable character of things, of the unpredictable shiftiness of existence does not begin with a belief (nor does yours). It begins with an experience, prior to any conceptdization. Since such experience conveys a primordial meaning, we may equate it with thought. Such a thought-experi- ence is without interpretive complexity, or reflective valuation. It does not, therefore, qw for a belief or reflexively-compound concept, though later beliefs and concepts spring from the initial thought-experience by interpretive valuation. Such basic thought-experience engraves a deep pattern with respect to the seeming void-ground of reality where the universe itself can suddenly be scooped from beneath an infant's physical support with but the slightest toss or gentle push; where the world of vertiginous spaces can suddenly enter, as a harrowing pang, the empty spaces of the infant-belly; where the distressingly unpredictable eruption of pain may install an abyssal void by thus negating the previous moment of idle pleasure. It is not, therefore, with any subsequent tissue of concepts (constituting elaborated commentary .of the cumulative \"interior monologue\" upon those original impressions) that the psyche must ultimately come to terms. To put it off and off on the requirement of a change of belief-patrem is the surest way to recess the continued real condition of one's life into the untouched background where it can only abscess, as attention is lavished on a superficial agent--the \"be- lief '--representing but the latest exemplification of the sheer friability of compound structures (remember, \"concept\" or \"belief' is already a complex, self-reflectively elaborated abstraction; because of this it simply exemplifies, in fonn, the same ambiguity and suspect hfkistmcture belonging to the compound field in general regardless what its contents might be)."},{"pageNumber":847,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The more the real condition (i-e. that of essential Void-being) is neglected, as long as the psyche fails to face it and indeed believes it can 't face it or that there's nothing there to face, the more it festers in the deep back-of-the-mind, repressed from visibility where it can only grow more virulent and indeed where it can begin to overgrow, like mold or neglected lichen, into the very motivations of the mind as a quietly contrary subversive impulse, some muffled urge to spontaneity (\"domesticated\" and brought out into polite company as energy-expenditure or aerobics, socially motivated exercise etc.). That which ultimately explodes upon our Central Park subject, then, does indeed possess a deep correspondence to her being but not in the sense of a simple commission-by-desire, or fear of \"others who are different hm ourselves\" etc. The experience bears a correspondence to her, but that correspondence isn't necessarily touched by the contents of belief-patterns which always make up secondary rationalizations, psychological specifications or symbolic masques of the basic Value. The real correspondence to her (which allows us to link the elements of existence in true \"mystical\" congruence and metaphysical sympathy while avoiding having to impart the lumpen YCYOR distortion) may be located in the continuously untouched zone of her being breathing beneath and quietly informing all reflective belief-content etc.: the void-zone of her own surprising/spontaneous reality, the recessed unpredictability factor of the omnipresent Variable lurking 'round every masking comer of existence, in the shadow of every streetlamp, in the hallway twist of her own security complex and in the random rebellion of her own thoughts imbued with an inveterate contrariness ... a randomness-of-thinking however which, in any given case touches only lightfy on the verboten and hardly constitutes such a prolonged/obsessive concentration as to condense one of the real psychic seed-form, periodically projected fiom the \"personal\" biomagnetic field as a coherent energydough serving to leaven coordinate elements of an ultimately-attracted Experience. This latter means of generating (roughly) minor-experience based on concentrated seed thoughts, ego-centralist belief patterns etc. is thoroughly detailed in the T-Bird article \"Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality\", Vol. 1, No. 4--detailed in fact much more completely than any endeavor of the professional reality-creators such as Bashar or Seth; yet in this article it's made clear that the mechanism of the magnetization of thought-fonns into experience is function of a far-more holistic reality than the Reality-creators depict, is in fact not different hm the device depicted here in which all such mind-manifestation exhibits the weedlike contrariness your life displays-where indeed your intent is to cultivate a garden so that the crabgrass appearing in response along with the daisies, must be said to bear a similitudesf-correspondence with the initiating seed-thought \"to grow\". (Conventional wisdom on the subject, of course, maintains such weeds indicate the uncorrected presence of contmy or negative thoughts alongside the \"good\". Initiated under- standing, however, recognizes all such desire, concept and intent whether positive or negative as comprising substitute identity equations for whole-being value; in this way the presence of \"weeds in the garden\" needn't indicate specific negative thinking, but serves in general as index of the chronic shortcoming and left-over space between such identity equations even of uniformly positive character and the Ground-of-being Itself.) ~ll such mind-manifestation arises on the ground of a whole-being Value bearing implications in, through, around and beneath the given thought-form that eternally makes of Realization something much more profound than an oil change in the belief filters we impose on reality (regardless your Reform to the side of Thought-positive Inputs only)."},{"pageNumber":848,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Thought Problem For The Prospective Reality-Creator: Whatever You Do, Don 't mink \"Monkey\" What we wish to distinguish here is the secondmy and symptomatic rather than primary style of causation belonging to personal belief-pattern, chronic thought-structures and desires etc. We pay passing recognition to the Realitycreator's virfually exclusive mode of magnetizing experiential events in the form of active thoughtcornmission, while locating it in the midst of a much more comprehensive inventory-of-means whereby the features of one's actual lifeexperience are generated both by commission (specific characteristic desire, intent etc.) and by omission (zones of the general being very specificdy neglected, especially where they fonn a natural counterpart to the active catalogue of identity patkm); by collective or mass-conscious patterns with which the personality may \"coincide\" only tangentially as a function of general place and time; and by \"random catalyst\" mentioned in the Ra material and comprising a causative category quite beyond the ken of Reality-creators to account altogether. We distinguish here the important idea (described with some detail as to its esoteric structure in the essays \"Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality\", T-Bird Vol. 1, No. 4 and \"Motto In The Lotto\", Vol. 2, No. I) that any possible \"personal\" belief-patterns, desires, aims, ambitions, fears, concepts or goals are simply incidental specifications of large ontological categories, i.e. basic modes-of-being bearing an abszract significance and general influence owing to their intrinsic derivation from, and reference toward, the unitive ground-of-being. It is the numen, the innate spiritual \"punch\" belonging to those ontological values--love, continuity, selfhood, identity- which is at issue, and which ultimately Acts Up on the stage-of-life (in the fitful guise, perhaps, of the various belief-patterns incorporating such values as ifthe personality had manufactured their distorted variations ex nihilo, out of its own unique existence); it's for this reason that Reality seems to echo-back and overwhelm, surround and saturate the ego-soul with so much larger a Return on its original meager identity-investment than would appear warranted by the input. In the humorous case of the Reality-creator's attempt to hd something at all commen- surate between the personality's often half-hearted flickering daydream and the megaton experien- tial explosion vaguely correlated by content with that dissolute cloud-castle, it certainly seems to be a chronic matter of sowing a little wind so as to reap the invariable Whirlwind. We can account for this laughable disproportion only by understanding that the relation of identity discerned between the personality's thoughts and the personality's experience, is that of the inescapable correspon- dence between all possible thought patterns and the (abstractly-inexhaustible) ontoIogical ideo- types of which they're dilute reflections. The tailoring of a given experience, even one collectively shared, to the contour profile comprising the system of selfdescriptive receptors whereby the personality necessarily attaches itself to the experience, shows only the manner in which beings integrate with and correspond to the experiential field as a function of holonomic response-coup1ing-i.e. they.coinhere as terms of a recessively self-duplicating pattern perceived at different scales of resolution. There is no primary implication of \"personal causality\" except insofar as the magical, funhouse-mirror of experience shapes and distorts the reflections of the general midway to personally-identifiable \"wavelengths\" as its parade passes along. Only those incidents, mirrored back, which reflect the results of meaningful participation may be said to correspond to a kind of eficient personal causality, in the extensive webwork of interrelated causes; otherwise, one may be said to \"cause\" or create what"},{"pageNumber":849,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV appears over the perceptual dace of that mirror only in the disingenuous manner that the presence of pebbles in a brook may be said inevitably to \"cause\" the responsive tailoring of pattems fonned by pressure of the water at their boundaries; the water obediently ripples in conformance to their \"profile\", so that the patterns issuing from the interface of fluid and silicate may certainly be said to \"depend\" upon the contingent incident of the sedimentary pebbles. Yet in what way may it be said that such pebbles \"caused\" anything more than the incident sculpting of ripples? in an overall pattern of nature-activity which sees rock and water as coinhering elements of a total process where one \"creates\" the other only in the sense of the mutually-necessitating conditionality of systemic complements. In what way may the pebbles take credit for their appearance in the stream? and for the specific processes whereby their presence necessitates certain corresponding behaviors in the fluid medium? which is neither modified in its nature, deflected or conscripted to their personal service as it obligingly bends in casual acknowledgment of their incidence in its onflowing motio n... or stayed from its own ultimate course. We may certainly say to the pebbles, as they reach the stage of self-reflection in the mirroring water where they're able to notice the ripple effect corresponding to requirements of their particular presence, \"why look! You create 'your own' reality!\" ... if it makes them feel any better. It's for this reason that, a few paragraphs back, we were given to emphasize that it most certainly may not be an invariable matter of ascertaining \"cause\" in the case of a given experience by simple detection of a fitfully-corresponding thought content flickering, amidst a flotilla of contents, through the interior monologue. One may \"see\" in any given incident a reflection of the presence of one's \"telltale\", identifying thoughtcontent, but only owing to the holonomic similitude of media, the correspon- dence of microcosm with macrocosm, and the tailoring requirement of one with respect to the other. Reality-creators would have us search the archeological digs of the given \"roof-brain chatter\" until some exhumed went in the identity-pattern displayed a sufiiciency of traits to . . convict as to \"cause\" on the incnrmnating basis of similarity alone. If you canfind that general idea or a reasonable facsimile circulating through your distractedly-ruminating mind, there's evidence enough that you \"thought\" the experience into existence. What the more disingenuous reality-creators are counting on folks won't understand, is that you're hardly culpable simply because something occurs to you. Though as an \"enculturated\" being you ingest a discriminative hierarchy of topic-categories (the inhibitory Freudian super-ego of parental values), the thinking mind especially in its associative/subliminal state as the \"interior monologue\" has no proprietary monitorper se and doesn't in itself honor the verboten character of certain themes or marginal topics. Owing to the essential indeterminacy of the mind as a function of the void-ground of consciousness, anything can (and does) occur to it. There's a primary and wonderful universalism to the mind such that it can only inhibit the occurrence of contents secondan'ly, as a reflexive matter. Therefore one may (and inevitably will) find oneself entertaining thoughts even of a verboten type, perhaps whimsically, mildly, fleetingly, but as a sure function of the primordial curiosity and ontological adventuresomeness belonging to a faculty founded on a basic indetenninacysf-being. This fact, however, is mf5cient-to-convict for the Reality-Creator. Thus if our Central Park subject \"thought it\" as passing content of the vaguest daydream, that's enough to establish cause and personal culpability as she lays, bleeding and comatose, on the ground. Think not? That is very ofien the only \"connection\" that may in fact be found between a"},{"pageNumber":850,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"victim\" and the deed perpetrated upon himlher. Did you really think that everyone attacked in an alley, starving in the streets, incidentally blown to bits by a terrorist bomb while shopping actively desired it, personally willed it into existence as a specific style of thinking or chronic fear? The Reality-creator has no way of accounting for the magic multiplier of \"random catalyst\" (which basically approaches from the void zone, functioning as blind-side-with-holes); no way of account- ing for values of correspondence suf3icient to show significant relationship without having to attach it, or reduce it down, to some ultimately meager entertainment of the mind. A Kundalini/Jack-in-the-Box Model Of Reality-Patterning If, then, the kinds of divergent experience received by personalities engaging very much the same kinds of risks and activities can't be unerringly interpreted as hction of the basic discrepancy of thought-types (desires, wishes, expectations), how-we might ask-may we account for the measurable difference in effect when a first theoretical subject jogs Central Park and is \"merely\" mugged without further harm, a second does the same and is all-but-murdered? Isn't this virtual evidence of a differential in belief patterns (given our agreement to abandon the conventional concept of \"accidental forces\")? We answer in this way: first of all we must also throw out the fantastical and indeed supercilious notion that the old Asian woman crawling, in sobs, through the wartom remnant of her home under the rubble of which her children lie buried, necessarily willed the situation on herself by frequently fantasizing or actively desiring the same! This notion is as insidious and insipid as you've always suspected it was while being too trepidatious to challenge \"higher wisdom\" on the subject. If the correspondence of experience with personal thought-content only margidly accounts for certain vaguely parallel effects (or similarities-by-reversal) we may still affirm the fundamen- tally comct principle that what's experienced is always in some way the magnetic corollary of the projective fieldenergy of one's signature being. We can account for that fact, though, (and simultaneously account for the discrepancy of effect between apparently equivalent inputs) by noting that Experience is a functional gauge of the specific proportion in the energy pattern of one's identity-profile, between Wltole-being Vdue and the orientationai stress of those psy- chological mechanisms through which one provisionaliy adapts to the compass of that Value. Thus in the case of our jogger we can say that the \"experience received\" wasn't a function of some simpldsingular belief without stress-tensor infrzrstructure, but of the complex ratio in the interaction between her specific coefficient of fear (her identifying response tone to the void-variable of existence) and the compensatory strength of her masking psychological mecha- nisms. This relationship gives the quotient of actualpressure obtaining between coexisting terms of her being which, while living in the same \"complex\", are never allowed to be introduced to each other. The specific quotient of pressure (describing the psyche's unique adaptation to the gauge standard of whole-being consciousness) gives the d~@?erential that accounts for the resub tant discrepancies in experience between people doing apparently the \"same things\". The more acutely the encompassing holism-of-being is denied or repressed (in fear of its commanding subsumption of all identified parts) the more pressure its continued unresolved Presence exerts, the more truly dysfunctional the strategies of psychological adaptation. Experience corresponds much more to that quotient than to any particular thought-content, which may or may not reflect that value. 835"},{"pageNumber":851,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV To refresh your memory on this point, we quote from the Motto In The Lotto essay: It is just simply not true that every rape victim somehow \"invited\" the experience as a personal form of b'commission\"; the fact of each Soul being a global microcosm of Total potential, automatically means that a certain amount of experience is going to be the resultant \"invitation\" of sheer aggravated emptiness on the balance-sheet of the (symmetrically self- compensating) soul-record. Note: aggravated emptiness. This then is a magnified deficiencywith respect to certain outstanding principles involved in the event; it is a smooth break in the soul record with respect to a whole class of potential, the burgeoning neglect of which progressively builds a magnetic charge placing great stress upon the Whole requiring precipitous compensation. (Note again: in a world where you \"create your own reality\", this potential area of being needn't be taken into account as everything is strictly a reflection of personal commission-4e. what's explicitly thought, actively desired, consciously believed etc) Since such general deficiency with respect to a given area of being produces a mosshe potential for precipitating \"experience\" involving just those gapped elements (there- fore usually a jarring experience), we may indeed be justified in concluding that such doctrines as \"you create your own reality\" serve unwittingly to imitate the probability of so eruptive an experience taking place. Experiences \"foreign\" and out-of-left-field in nature do manifestly characterize the things that sometimes befall us; they can't just be \"owned\" by arbitrarily identifying some active or positive thought-structure which---by tortured interpretation--can be teased into disgorging some vague parallelism (\"Oh yes, I must have gotten that dysentery because of my dislike for Mexican architecture!\"). A Little \"Matter\" Of Perspective Well, Monty (we hear a quorum of Bashar-quoters gasp out a last quasichallenging charge as they lay, largely littered--if out of nothing more than exhaustion in pursuit of the marathon argument--over the Ground): if the-veritably buddhistic-variability and contingency-of-being is a major factor in the subliminal keying of issues and attitudes as well as types of experience reflecting identity-pattern repressions, rationalizations and distortions with reference to the Whole; and if that major factor of the background void-state of being is first of all an experience rather than a belief or concept that can be changed to another belief or concept, then what is to be done about the apparently problematic condition of life? Good question, Bashar-dudes. Thought you'd never ask. While it's true that the Void-state of being presents itself through the variable ambiguity of compound~coordinate conditionalily, the sense of precarious imbalance imparting its specific psychological substrate is a function ofperspective. In a sense that \"conditionality\" and delicate interdependence of mutable elements is an effect of Perspective, i.e. the angle-of-intersection constituting the focal-coordinate resolution of the \"ego subject\" with reference to a field of ideotypes having specific-coordinate+tential. (The 3rd-density physical realm represents one such field of ideotypes; the ideotypes aren't \"thoughts\" arbitrarily \"creating the earth-reality\" but intents modeling certain implications within an overall fhmework oriented to basic Ontological values. They are modes with reference to the Whole, and great lifewaves of consciousness provisionally identz3 through such common modes--that's what you're all doing \"here\".) In this way we see how the factor of Perspective initiates the delicate conditionality in"},{"pageNumber":852,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the interplay of experience, and is in turn coordinately referenced through that system of contin- gencies so as to force the early interpretation or persuasive \"sense\" of such conditionality as threatening (or potentially threatening). Just as such perspectival intersection of the subject-self aligns a voiirionaf relation with the coordinate+variables of being toward maximized stability, so the contingency of those coordinate-variables predicates a continuous potential instability. Beliefs, thoughts and desires are only generated secondarily, out of the basic ideotypes or permis- sible pattern of the mework which are not at all personallylprivately wrought, ex nihilo. From our Initiated description we see then that changing beliefs about the background isn't the point, since it continues to generate the same subliminal experience with the same \"message\" until an overall reconciliation with its metastable void-being is effected. Since it is the inauguration of Perspective which kicks off the metastable system and its implications with reference to the angular coordinates of thatperspective, we see that it's necessary to establish a congruency in those perspectival coordinates with reference to mole-being Vlrlre. This millennial prospect being accomplished, the resultant conscious coincidence be- tween whole-being value and the locus-of-intersection (comprising the apparent subject-self) effects the necessary conciliation and smooth congruence with the Void-field of being (which as we've seen, thanks to the amendations necessitated by the Bashar material, is not other than that unitive Whole-being ground, and that ground is not other than Consciousness-Bashar's \"neutral\" background experiential field, remember, exists in fact solely as the cancellation or ''voidance\" of all polar-perspectival charge through the totality of consciousness). It is this which allows a coincident flow-without-disparity relative to the conditional field, thereby adopting that field as one's \"fiiend\" and as indistinguishable fiom one's Self. Such essential befieding of the experiential field-of-being quite obviously carries an innately positive \"charge\" or value, in itseK Thus, \"positive\" secondary thoughts, belief-structures etc. flow naturally fiom this whole-being r&rientation, not the other way aroud-Bashar claims the \"reality-creator\" can begin from the part-to-the-whole or from the whole-to-the-part; but the former is at best asymptotic, and in fhct forever fails to touch the whole. (Bashar says this of course in order to encourage the adoption of piecemeal beliefs in the conceit that Everything will change thereby, knowing perfectly well no one is going to leverage the whole through fulcrum of some finite \"belief '.) This resolution of consciousness (even through perspectival cross-section of the subject- self) with the experiential void state is at the same time that true occasion in the parallel &-fall of everything with everything else (alluded to by Bashar) fiom which Change of magical effectiveness may be initiated with just a gentle nudge. This is not however the equivalent of the \"limbo\" state Bashar invokes as nearest 3rddensity mgate of such true Void-conscious Resolution (the \"limbo\" state is fktually depressed, has too little consciousness available to parlay into any sort of resolution, and represents in any case an irresolution or wasteful indecision-of-direction rather than a truelrelieving equipotentiality of direction)."},{"pageNumber":853,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Part 1 Theta-Void: The TV Of Love And Fear We may understand this required spiritual Change in relation to Void-being, in the illustrative tenns of brainwave research (we've spoken about this before in the T-Bird pages---this fiunishes yet another way of relating to the information). In the \"early years\" of brainwave monitoring, initial encounter with \"theta-waves\" ascribed a much more negative reputation than they're now known to enjoy. The original subjects of theta-wave research belonged to the average statistical cross-section; it was found through this average that registration of the deep theta-wave patterns invariably accompanied fear and anxiety reactions, so that such waves became associated with the coding of negative conditioning related to fightlflight syndromes of the basal brainlobes (by initiated understanding, correlated through resonant correspondence with the vital- abdominal complex). When however researchers began in the '70s to test those conforming more to Maslow- like definitions of \"self-actualized', creative artists, yogis and zen-adepts etc. it was puzzlingly found that theta-wave registry was associated with deeply creative and profound altered-con- sciousness states. There wasn't a trace of the reactive fear-patterns found in the \"norm\". Though brain research itself doesn't seem to have a way of accounting for the contrast, initiated understanding has already explained through other contexts how in the former case theta-wave patterns show a correlation with the deep void state of being in terms of typical trepidation. This is the original or infantile orientation to the void state of the experiential fields (linked by initiated interpretation, remember, with the basal brainlobes-where, indeed, discharge of theta patterns is detected--and corresponding abdominal centers). The void-state correlated theta waves become tailored by the developing psychological complex as praetorian guards, stationed on the low-lying alert to sound the alarm in the triggering of parallel or suggestively reminiscent circumstances. Thus in the case of the statistical average they seem to be specifically fear-registering wave forms. When however we find them correlated strongly in the case of \"self-actualizers\" with creative and profound meditative states, we recognize that the first instance represents a really secondary adaptation of their patterns in terms of reaction, self-involution, repression and a certain modifcation of the basic void-state as a complex system of psychological negations. In the second (creativdself-actualizing) instance we see the same theta waves functioning directly as void-patterning process, which exactly signifies the reconciling adoption of, and identification through, the void-term of experience as Source of the characteristic elasticity and profound variability of the Creative Will itself. A true model of resolution shows through this latter usage. In order to move from the one orientation of Void-being to the Other, it's essential that a means be found for the intensifling light of consciousness to show upon those states in which theta-waves are coopted to typifling reaction-patterns--not so as to change beliefs or ideas about those patterns but to recognize them for what they are by and through the comparative Standard of Whole-being value progressively drawn forward, into conscioukness, on that Intensification. Recognition of the presence of such patterns through a creative intensification in the Void \"light\""},{"pageNumber":854,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of consciousness, furnishes the sufficient threshold occasion for de-contracting the reactively-com- pressed emotional \"knot\" of the pattem, into a psychic field so enlarged as to be able to accept and balance its bottled energy in consciousness. The most powerfd and appropriate means of intensification enabling the liberative movement from the one-prelimhmy-orientation of Void-being to the Other, is and always has been the spiritually-authorized means presented for proper progression of the planetary Mother: the Whole-being Initiation of the Mother-current Itself: Comparison Diagrams For The Discerning Reality Shopper Given this general overview of the respective philosophical positions of Sassani and Southem Crown, we should be able to diagram a summary for purposes of pictorial flash-me. The diagram numbered 1, depicts the Sassani perspective. Diagrams numbered 2A, 2B and 2C give the basic principles and map some important implications of the Southern Crown perspective. It should be said that, in rendering these ideas imagistically there's nothing injected arbitrarily so as to distort or bias the respective depictions. Note for instance that, in rendering the Sassani idea re the relation of Consciousness to the manifest fields, those fields are emblemized by what appears to be a random distribution of subjectdobjects; whereas in the parallel SC depicton that field is portrayed in circularly-mirroring, mandalic symmetry so as to conform its outline in a ready harmony with the consciousnesscircle. The objection might be raised that this is an arbitrary and unfair use of pictorial conventions, since it biases the eye immediately toward noticing a smoother philosophical resolution of tenns in the SC depiction. The response to this, would refer you back to what's been said about the respective characterizations of these principles. In the Southern Crown context, the ultimate \"neutrality\" of the manifest field is only understandable in terms of its wnbilicalrehtion with the sphere of consciousness; as we see in the diagrammatic insets, the \"neutrality\" of the manifest fields is strictly a product of the relationship between the fields-as-a-whole, and consciousness-as-a-whole. If consciousness is assigned a charge-value of Void through circular representation, the mandalic depiction of the dest field does justice to the relationship as characterized; the global distribution of its coordinates not only signifies identity with the equipotential value of consciousness (symbolized as \"global invariance\") but makes obvious the common chargecancellation of polarldesting extremes--their \"mate- rialization\" through a unitive void locus of initial (nondimensional) point limitation comprising the signal creative proposition out of which everything appears by contrastive complementaries in endlessly circular self-reference. The void juncture of that polar convergence-point gives the tm of umbilical correspondence with the global Void value of consciousness. It's fair to depict it in this way, since these are the elements given in the description. Indeed we're scrupulously fair to the Sassani account since, as you'll note by consulting diagram 1, we've allowed their version of consciousness the grace of a similar voiddepiction (as its central quality) though it must be inferred fiom their demiptions given the elasticity of meaning-endowment etc. However, we can't similarly depict the Sassani version of the manifst fields as homologously global or mandalically-symmetric in character since there's no inference in their description with regard to such attributes; on the contrary, the Sassani render an overtly arbitrary relation between meaning-endowing consciousness and the neutral fields, inferring such fields are neutral independent of consciousness4us there's no basis for graphing the necessary geomew of their asserted neutrality. In the Sassani fiamework, those fields are \"just neutral\", by"},{"pageNumber":855,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV themselves; the neutrality has no necessary genesis, or point of reference. If the objection is raised that \"neutrality\" implies a common convergence-point of mutual, polar cancellations, we'd have to insist such implication can't in this case be granted since the Sassani don't in any way follow through on what would be inferred thereby. There's no necessary symmetry to the field's relation to consciousness, and no necessary symmetry within itself. The neutrality of the fields \"in themselves\" would just as faithfully be depicted by aflixing arbitrary neutral-signs to each subjectlobject in the diagram. Owing to the graphic congruence allowed between consciousness and the manifest fields as rendered in the SC diagram, we may the more easily understand that \"neutral\" value as arising strictly by virtue of the psychic character of the relationship (the integral relation of the manifest patterns-of-being to consciousness, imparts an irreducibly psychic character to those patterns). Since such field-neutrality derives from a psychic value, there is an implicit quality to the relationship itself having an innately psychic charge: that quality, as we've seen, is Love. Our graphic depiction of the relationship as inevitably predicating the quality of Love, makes of that quality an innate attribute of reality. It is not an arbitrary value-assignment or indifferent \"meaning\" floating in consciousness, applied to the \"neutral\" canvas by caprice so as to imbue the latter with a \"stimulating\" quality-something to make it more \"interesting\" or to \"excite one's enthusiasm\" for the time being. This essential difference in the philosophical depictions makes a world of difference in our understanding of the relative meanings that attach to products of the manifest field (or, more accurately, in the rendering of those products though the relation between the manifest fields and consciousness). With our SC depictions in the number-two diagrams, we see that \"meaning\" isn't something arbitrarily imposed on a basically neutral field through the caprice of consciousness, but rather arises in the relation between Whole-being consciousness and the provisional identity patterns of self-representation modeling whole-being values in the field of Limit. Thus objects or definitional things in the manifest field separately considered hm their wholesale neutral resolution-in-consciousness, supply the functional terms of \"finitude\"; they give flesh and character to the abstract principle of Limit, which is the chief creative potential within Illimitable Void-conscious Being Itself. Thus they arise through and draw upon the whole-being character of consciousness, even apart from consideration of their universal resolution in conscious- ness. According to the more extensive discussion in the Mother Terasu essays, the unitive relief-definition through which mutually mod@ing coordinates of the manifest field generate a stabilized convergence locus of--provisionally persisting-self-congruence through all contribu- tory attributes (i.e. a king, object or thing), is expression of the principle of Limit itselfas it borrows against Whole-being value and attempts to establish the infinite consistency/self-congruence of whole-being value in its own conditiody self-defining terms. Any definitive Resolution of the processes of Existence within that framework would have to turn on a decisive recognition arising in their relationship with Whole-being Consciousness as to the nature, orientation and Reference of such processes thus directly disclosing (to the cognitive field-activity patterning consciousness) the shared point-of-departure and present real value informing them; in this way, all cognitive field-activity would resolve to common denominator of the Void-locus through which it was polarized, and which is simultaneously the shared term between the manifest fields and conscious- ness. Such Void-locus is the Heart of all activity, and represents the meeting-ground of Love."},{"pageNumber":856,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV These considerations assign entirely different values (fiom those of the Sassani) to the fields of relative \"meaning\"; we see how there's not only an umbiiically-necessary relation between thefields as a whole and consciousness, but between the delimited identitypatterns ofprovisional self-modeling within those fields, and consciousness-as-a-whole. Those provisiondself-repre- sentative patterns are rotated in relation to a real standard an incorruptible Reference. They take their point-of-departure therefrom, implicitly target it as the sufficiency of all realizations thereby, suffer contrastively compromised qualities therefore. There is a continuous sense of relative correspondence or relative inharmony to existence which isn't accountable at all in the \"reality- creating\" fixmework of the Sassani. Such correspondence or inharmony can't be considered simply relafive to the context, as the Sassani would have it (i.e. ifyou seem to grate againstyour surrounding circumstances this sense of relative \"inharmony\" is due simply to your having assigned the wrong arbitrary label to it). The degree of correspondence or inharmony ultimately represents the degree to which the Whole-being value of Love (imparting the value assignment and meaning of the manifest fields as a whole in relation to consciousness) is given expression, or distorted into relative products of its functional lack. (The basis of such apparent lack or discrepancy between identifica- tion-patterns and the Being through which they arise, is more completely addressed in the next portion of this piece treating definitions of idea, thought, concept etc.) In Case You've Always Wondered Why Lemon Doesn't Taste Like Garlic In order to understand this integral elicitation of meaning, we need only consider the way in which existence is actually apprehended. Putting aside all ideal models as to how there may be some \"superconscious\" magnification of oneself secretly projecting all qualities from Above, by -native caprice, between the polarized wings of the manifest proscenium-arches (beneath which the ego-reflection is mirrored and emotively reacts like a marionette), we may simply consider what it's like waking up in the morning. First of all, we catch ourselves in the act of awakening; this process is already going on when awareness catches up with it--it doesn't matter if we've \"commanded\" our mind by subliminal program to wake up at a certain hour-we're not in command of nor do we normally have knowledge regarding the way in which this order is received by the automatic processes of our \"entity\", and carried through. Existence yields itself to our budding faculties spontaneously, and saturates us with its quality even as we align ourselves by characteristic response-patterns to it In what way may we conceive we endow this irrepressible existence with \"meaning\", when it hands us the range of meanings with which we'll be working, and the facultative patterns through which to work them? Nor is this \"given\" character of the meaning-field an arbitmy impositionjFom that field to our consciousness. Those meanings blossom as symbolic characterizations of the deep relationship between Consciousness and the ambiguously variable inversely-polar patterns of provisional identification in the focal field. The fact that we, as consciousness, tend to polarize into identified alignment with some phase in the given range of meaning accompanying those variables, hardly makes us reality-creators (except insofar as children \"create\" when they select one color ova, another, and proceed to paint in hues of symbolic correspondence reflecting states of consciousness altogether beneath their grasp but nonetheless characterizing fonns of provisional adjustment in their psychological makeup"},{"pageNumber":857,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Me arises in the rrhbioll betweem whole-belng conaclomsneaa and the mWbb-I~m(tcrrrdrll.rcprr- dhdiy modell-- consdois -11-repre- sentation in the eomditioul Ileld, tbr -IdaWygmlllrdtk"},{"pageNumber":858,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV giving the quotient of correspondence between their wholeness and the operative ratios of personal identity investment). As an example which should be easy to understand but seems wholly overlooked by eager \"reality-creators\" everywhere, when one encounters a lemon (for instance) one doesn't ascribe any arbitmy character to its taste. Yet its physical being is necessarily apsychic impres- sion-it doesn't exist as a neutral item in-itself until consciousness comes along and endows it with significance or meaning. It discloses its \"window\" of significance or meaning to us, as an immediate psychic event4.e. as expression of the necessary relationship between consciousness and the polarized grid-pattern of the manifest fields. As we rotate the lemon in our fingers it divulges a panoply of properties, theoretically inexhaustible since there's no limit to the detail with which it could be scrutinized; and it renders properties that are contextualiy meamq@ to us insofir as we're interested in it chiefly as a fiuic as a genus, as part of the family of food groups, as a mass susceptible to mathematical measurement, as a handy object to throw, as a suitable subject to paint etc. Yet even this range of contextual meanings isn't created, ex nihilo; they loan themselves to the potential of our \"consideration\" strictly because the lemon is constituted by delimiting properties defining, narrowing and orienting the resultant rotation of psychic reflections about its shiny-sunlight presence. One may \"'think\" anything one likes in relation to it; one isn't limited by the preposterous. But in this consideration, one's thinking takes its point-ofdeparture from the specific given qualities of the lemon and is always referenced toward those qualities even if, in the imagination, it infinitely surpasses them. Any object as ''the lemon\" potentiates a psychic context. It gives us a meaningful point-ofdeparture before we devise labels for it in any way. Biting into it, though a physical gesture, is an irreducibly psychic event (and by extrapolation so is everything, though our \"lemon\" presents a formidable case!); its sensible quality discloses to us a vivid range of psychic potential-+ate that we do not require ponderous self-reflection or the mechanical assignment of agreed-upon conven- tions, in order to understand immediately what's meant when someone is said to have a \"sour disposition\", or when something is characterized as \"a lemon\". Such expressions wouldn't have loaned themselves to currency or suggested themselves in the first place, if their metaphorical reference didn't draw upon an immediate, sharedpsychic significance. Fairly considered, this is the essence of communication--the underlying state of existence which permits a shared field of experience or consensual point-ofdeparture in the first place. A world of \"reality-creators\" in the Sassani sense would be an atomistic world of self-en- closed, solipsistic psyches with no ground or common basis for sharing their arbitrarily-generated meanings at all. And note the fact that \"lemon\", for instance, while immediately yielding a shared psychic window of meanings, doesn 't restrict or contraindicate the irreducible character of the pee-will variable. Such a volitional variable always arises on the indeterminate ground of con- sciousness itself: There are no fmed-unambiguous meanings given to consciousness fiom the field of experience, before-the-fact; but because that field of experience possesses a correspondence with consciousness through their relationship, it may interpretively render that \"indeterminate\" quality in its characteristic way, through its own self-polarizing medium. Thus \"lemon\" (again for example) yields an immediate vivid range of psychic meanings, which, as a characteristic reflection of consciousness, stretches between polar-opposite extremes. At first glance \"lemon\", like any other of the psycho-active properties of the created"},{"pageNumber":859,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1V fields, may seem to negate or internally cancel what purchase it may appear to have had upon any de_fnitepJychic value; it's organic or inbuilt meaning to consciousness, might seem a chimera. But this is only at first glance: if the \"meanings\" of lemon range from the negative inflection of tart, acrid or rejective to the positive inflection of tangy; purzfiing or exhilarating, such a range isn't \"self-negating\" (thereby inferentially inviting any other--and arbitraxy-hposition of meaning). When \"lemon\" is associated with the extremes of those recited values, it imparts to either extreme a very distinct and identifiable character. The \"purifying\" sense of a lemon is not the same as that of a flowing brook, or a whitehot fire. Such psychic distinctions are precisely the means whereby we receive the real richness and irreducible immediacy of the actual effects of the created field. They are not indifferently counterchangeable, but give us a vivid psychic vocabulary of nuance, idection, subtle differentiation and integral uniqueness whereby the psyche may live a crackling inexhaustible representation of the overflow Meaning generated between the experiential fields and Consciousness. In comparison, the arbitrary interchangeability of the \"reality-creator's\" capricious meaning-endowment reduces everything to a flat equivalency, strips reality of its actual richness and appreciably reduces the creative elasticity with which the Psyche may work! Certainly \"lemon\", like any other object, state or thing in the manifest field may be employed arbitrarily, as a kind of cipher. It may be used to arbitrarily stand for something else unconnected to it by form or content etc. Its function in such case, however, ceases to be that of a symbol; such functions are frequently misnamed \"symbol\", but they are actually that of a sign. A figure functioning as a sign takes on whatever reference or equivalent the mind independently determines, and &es to it. Thus a lemon can represent, in some shorthand or code, the \"information-limit\" of a given medium, the \"territory marked by the northwest bouda~~\" etc. Indeed this arbitrary ascription as a simple equivalency-function is exactly what the \"reality-crea- tor\" necessarily signifies in the assumption that all meanings are the arbitrary determination of consciousness, and are equivalently interchangeable! The reality-creator is left with a purely abstract code, significant to himself alone except insofix as he can get others to accept the arbitrarypremises for purposes of communication, as with the dots and dashes of Morse. Yet insofar as others accept that code (within the \"reality-creator\" premise) by that much do they necessarily sacrifice their own"},{"pageNumber":860,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Triangular Craft Of Peripatetic Philosopher Downed From Skies By Triangulated Crafting of Perennial Philosophy We have refrained, until now, fiom extending explicit definitions; since first it was necessary to see what the implicit definitions might be, that were contained in the Sassani philosophy. In determining how the Sassani necessarily define such values as \"I\" (i-e. \"you\"), \"create\" and \"reality\", we've encountered the contradictions contained therein which make it increasingly clear why explicit defmitions are skirted in the Bashar recitation; it has been made increasingly clear as well, not only what those terms must not be (in order to retain functional validity) but what they must possess or imply, in order for there to remain in them any sense of their actual/intuited character. We have seen how the Sassani \"definitions\", delivered by fiat without pause to measure against the magnitude of real values they describe, give us our qualities back (of will, meaning, perception, experience, relationship) only strangely altered, actually scaled down in the full dimensions through which they're originally received-4ored to a flat cutout of those values as they're immediately available to us without Sassani interdiction. We've seen the way in which this \"philosophy fiom the skies\", of such apparently gratis transdimensional philanthropy, actually reduces the creative richness of reality as given while ostensibly delivering a liberative word whereby we may enlarge the Mework of our creative fieedom. We've discovered that, while seemingly shedding light on \"secret\" levers of our efficacy chronically hidden fiom us, the Sassani philosophy produces the inevitable effect of following the self-same course conventionally taken by the standard sets of desires and ordinary expectancies, only more \"filled with ourselves\" having been imbued with a confidence in no way corresponding to the intuited range of implications returned in the experience that roughly arises in response. While there's a relationship of correspondence between component values of our ongoing personality-equation and the kinds of experience contour fitted to the energy quotient of that profile, there's never demonstrated a one-to-one correspondence between our personal desire- contents and the totality of correlated experience. This is due to the fact thaf as we've seen, any given aim, objecf thought-content, desire or concep;tuaiization is sympom rather than cause; it is symptom of a more complex relation between particular and universal, between the totality and any given expression of that totality. As long as any such aim, concept, object or goal is presumed as causal, the \"effect\" issuing therefiom is going to be (subtly or overtly) ambiguous. Such an effect can never act as denouement, for it's the manifest response to an intending system of components in a state of symptomatic tension. Even the \"goal\" of spiritual Realization is, in itself, symptomatic; as long as it presumes itself causal (the common presumption--%ashar would merely sanctifj, it with philosophy), the noble aim of \"spiritual realization\" will arrive in the form of a co~~esponding object. It will exhibit"},{"pageNumber":861,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV all the lineaments of expectation, all the colors with which it was initially imbued by desire; yet in all those components there'll be an embodiment of the initiating tension and of the irresolute/com- pound factors filling intent as a mass of symptoms. Only when intent begins to identify itself rn symptomatology, so that reality may begin to deliver insight rather than object, may anything take place through the creative patterns other than the subtly-felt entrapment belonging to the usual experience-generating mechanism merely upgraded to formal \"philosophy\" by the Sassani. In Search Of Meaningful Relationships Now that we've grasped at least this much, we may proceed toward real definitions. These definitions will have a sufficient elasticity to fit the opulent facts of our experiential reality, and of our principial agencies; they will have a sufficient specificity to fiee them from unaddressed and unresolved ambiguities as may be found in the Sassani's forced philosophical march across overtly undefined terrain (implanted with implicit definitions ready to go off like landmines). We've seen that there's a basic sterility belonging to any definition of consciousness as a \"consciousness of meanings\", over against a neutral experiential field. Instead, we've seen that meaning necessarily arises in the relation between the whole-being value of consciousness and the experiential field. We may now ask the further logical questions as to what kinds of meanings arise therefrom? what is their nature? what makes them what they are as functions of such a relationship, rather than as arbitrary and interchangeable ciphers issuing fiom the one-sided caprice of \"con- sciousness\"? In asking those pertinent and specific questions, we arrive at the Southern Crown defmitions. If \"meaning\" arises in the relation between consciousness and the experiential field, we must deeply understand what wnsciousness is-and what the experiential field is* that we may understand the qudities by which meaning imparts its character to the relationship. Only in this way may we understand our orientation to creativity, will, fkedom and conscious Spirit. Just as science likes to eliminate arbitrary parameters, and is uncomfortable with magnitudes which aren't necessary elements of the descriptive theorem or which don't issue inevitably fiom the current postulates, so spiritual scientists and philosophers shouldn't be content with the existence of unaccounted or arbitmy parameters. If the experiential field has a relation to consciousness (out of which meanings arise) we should expect to know the exact character of that relationship. Indeed the exact character of the relationship has already been exactly portrayed, in the Mother Terasu essays \"What is 'Christ Consciousness'?\" But don't despair. We won't broach the subject only to deflate expectation with a reference to something perhaps not read, nor readily to hand. We'll graciously review some of the key precepts of those T-Bird essays, and integrate them to the present context. Monty, of all people, is hardly parsimonious with words. Terasu Redoux-Identity, Self And Consciousness Consciousness, as we may recall--or come to leamfcom the Mother Terasu essays, isn't definable apart fiom the factor of identiq. Since consciousness involves an awareness of its own being in order to be conscious, such awareness necessarily accomplishes the identity of consciousness with itself. (We back into a full metaphysical definition of consciousness, fiom the point-of-departure containing terms that may be immediately recognized and agreed-upon by all.)"},{"pageNumber":862,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"Identity\" is that which is conformant to itself, homogenous with itself, self-consonant and coextensive through all terms as which it's in agreement with itself. Such internal consistency and thorough uniformity distinguishes factors necessarily involved in a characterization of \"self\". The \"sehess\" and \"identity\" of being are values inextricably bound up in considera- tions of consciousness; they have no being or significance apart fiom consciousness. We need not be concerned here with whether the factor of \"selfhess\" expresses as \"I\" or \"we\" etc.; nor need we kt at this point, in good buddhistic fashion, whether \"selfhess\" isn't a delimiting tm constituting the ego-reference of being at the problematic root of existence, establishing artificial boundaries against a liberative Selflessness of being. At this point, \"selfhess\" is minimally given as a value of identity; and identity is at this point unburdened with qualifiers of any kind, other than the selfdefining stipulation that it maintain continuity and homogenous conformance through all the terms with which it's in agreement with itself. We are not restricted, at this juncture, fiom positing an absolute identity. And what would such an \"absolute identity\" be? It would simply comprise that which was absolutely consistent, self-consonant and in uniform continuity with itself to the infinite part. It would simply be that which was infinitely self-same under all conditions. Enlarging this to a \"definition\" of consciousness, we would say that absolute consciousness is that which is infinitely consistent and self-conformant with itselfin coming to itself through the awareness of its homo- genously self-same Identity, in coextensive commonality under all conditions. It doesn't escape us at this point, that this is a definition of Unity. What unity is it, we may then ask ourselves, which permits the homogenously self-same and unqualifiedly consistent conformance of being in identity with itself, to the limitless degree? The answer, after due consideration, is necessarily that of void-being. Only void can answer to the value that posits no restriction on the terms with which identity could be in agreement or self-consonance with itself. Thus we find that, in \"defining\" consciousness, we come upon nothing in the definition necessary to the idea of consciousness that restricts it a priori, or limits it to a qualified or qualifying function. The necessary factor of Identity does not qualz> it, just because it's integral to the definition. The homogenous uniformity of Identity even to the infinite part, pennits conditions within the defrning framework; it merely stipulates that it remain infinitely self-conformant and in unbroken continuity with itself under all conditions. Thus we may distinguish the Southern Crown definition of consciousness fiom all defmitions, even springing fiom spirituavmetaphysical sources, which segregate consciousness fiom the \"superior\" value of absolute-being and complicate it as a system of internal \"moving parts\", as a \"process\" or cognizing pattern-of-being etc. AU such definitions as those just mentioned, enlist the term \"consciousness\" for properties belonging more satisfactorily to mind in the Southern Crown Empyrean. The first-line importance in consideration of any such comparative definitions, is internal self-consistency; one may accept any definition, in context, with an eye to tracking its comprehensiveness and continuity across the network of defmitions. As long as internal consistency is maintained, the prevailing definition may be considered minimally suitable or satisfactory; otherwise, it becomes a matter of semantics. It shouldn't take a metaphysical student long to realize that some systems posit Mind as the supreme value, with \"consciousness\" a secondary and reflective projection; some exalt"},{"pageNumber":863,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Consciousness on a parity with the Mind of other systems, or make them interchangeable; some differentiate mind and consciousness fiom a Supreme Value ostensibly transcendent to either. In order to be spared the notion of the ultimate arbitrariness of all such definitions, however, we must now ask the reader as an additional consideration to evaluate the respective rationales for so defining these terms. \"A Man's Got To Know His Limitationsw-Dirty Harry The teaching of Southern Crown notes, for instance, that the systems which separate \"mind\" or \"consciousness\" fiom a transcendent Value do so under pressure of the implication that \"consciousness\" carries a reflective factor making it a complex of polarized parts positing subject and object, knower and known, observer and observed. This is the \"scissioning\" root of dest dualism and juxtaposition, as far as such teachings are concerned, which gives birth to the relative worlds and therefore can't be taken as authentic candidate for the Supreme Value. Southern Crown, on the other hand, suggests that the immediate identification of subjectlobject dualism in the Self-reflexive principle establishing continuity-of-identity, is a giveaway trademark of the dichoto- mizing subjectlobject mind. The involved presence of that mind in making such evaluation upon the principle of Self-reflection, belies the sympathetic immediacy which alone could make adequate appraisal of that chief conscious factor. The dualizing mind would of course find evidence of dualism, in the surveyed products of self-reflection. However we've already seen that, in the Southern Crown Empyrean there's been discerned a basic unity in the self-reflexive value which-& effect-loops together the ends in the continuity of Identity so as to establish the infinite self-conformance of being through the (indis- pensably unifying and self-securing) factor of awareness. If the seed of dichotomy exists in this matrix of primordial ontology, it doesn't reside in the Self-reflexive principle in itself. (Already we hurl a heresy into the arena, since the potential of self-reflection-or awareness-of-itself+ been accepted by a millennium of secondary esoteric interpreters just outside the Inner Sanctum of the Mystery Traditions, as the sine qua non of dualism and differentiation.) The first value of Self-reflection isn't dichotomy, but unity-awareness. It doesn't establish the \"subjective\" awareness of its \"objectivized\" self-continuity, since the medium of its unity-awareness is void; the awareness and the continuity of which it is aware, are homogenously self-same and are indeed given together. We may say that they enable one another, make one another possible or mutually potentiate one another; but there's no possibility of this mutual enabling being gainsaid, since its medium is void. Primordially, \"awareness\", \"continuity\", \"void\" and \"con- sciousness\" are equated; because at this primary level they may be equated, all together constitute an Absolute principle. The Unity in the homogenous self-continuity of Identity is an absolute unity; by definition it prevails under all conditions, thereby establishing a Supreme Value. We may next ask: in a void-context, what are the \"conditions\" under which such unity may prevail? One may presume \"void\" as a vacuum, a complete absence or nothingness. Such a medium would certainly lack impedance to a hypothetical self-continuity. Yet, because such Void is necessarily identical to the homogenous Identity of Consciousness, it imbues the latter with a \"power\" of non-restriction. Because it imbues consciousness with the power of non-restriction, it \"gifts\" consciousness with the value of all-puissance. It endows it with the genius of limitless possibility."},{"pageNumber":864,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV What, exactly, would the nature of such all-possibility possibly be? We could say it was the value of an absolute potential, given its non-restriction; but that would be redundant, wouldn't itit would hardly \"gift\" itself with everything it already sponta- neously was! If in its own nature it was already absolute and limitless, unqualified and k, it would seem the prototype value of the whole of its all-potential would necessarily be that of limitation, of restriction and reductive qualification. Indeed this primordial \"potential\" of Absolute-being, unrestricted in its void-nature and therefore all-permissive in its consequent amplitude, takes character as the spontaneous allowance of all potential and act& occasions. We may \"define\" the Void value of absolute-being in just this way: the spontaneous allowance of all potential and actual occasions. In the unqualified infinity of its absolute-nature, we cannot discriminate initially between potential and actual occasions nor even between \"discrimination\" and \"non-discrimination\"; thus the \"potential\" of consciousness is, uniquely, the equipotential allowance of all potential and actual occasions. All such occasions, potential and actual, share a common term as springingfi.om the all-permissive value ofAbsolute; the prototype of that all-permissiveness is the apparent self-nega- tion or paradoxical internal denial centering around the (contrary) value of limitation4us all such potential and actual occasions give life to the principle of (apparent) limitation. The apparency of this \"limitation\" is paramount; it cannot constitute a real degradation of absolute^' into relative terms, of limitlessness into bottomless restriction since any such collapse would undermine the very Term essential to limit's support; i.e. Void-being with all its implied value of illimitable all-permissiveness. The term of ''limit\" is therefore a derivative expression, and depends for its continued support on the inherent value of Absolute (which eternally implies the maintenance-management of its own internal \"contradiction\"--ao less than the haunting refkin of \"the relative\"). At the same time, then, \"limit\" may claim the right of its own inherent validity (like the child who insists the parents finance perpetual uncritical support of his capricious escapades, by virtue of the fact that they gave him such independent birth. We this argument may not work in most familial contexts, it certainly works where the Metaphysical family is concerned). By noting this \"financed independenceW+r, dependent independence--we necessarily note the generation of a kind of hierarchic model almost fiom the very beginning. In this way we've dodged the first ontological bullet, the idea of an innate dualism in which the principles of Absolute and of finitude engage in a perpetual warfare through the tension of incompatibles. In view of the Southem Crown description, it's possible to see that regardless all appearance anarchy never reigns in the cosmos (chaos and ana~chy aren't the same, as we'll see) since there's no real dualism of terms but an umbilical connection and hierarchic relation between the One and the \"other\". The term of Limit depends on the Largesse ofAbsolute; but this is a \"non-Abelian symmetry\": the value of Absolute does not similarly depend on the term of \"limit\", though the latter is eternally implied through the former. They're not on equal footing, since to allow \"limit\" a real parity of potential with limitlessness would break the parity immediately and infinitely degrade the unitive value of Absolute to a relativized dust. Since \"limit\" is umbilically connected to Absolute, derivatively dependent while laying plausible claim to its own inherent validity, we may next ask: what is the implied mode whereby the value of limit takes its being, under these ontological circumstances? The answer supplies an"},{"pageNumber":865,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV essential key to all our initial questions regarding the relation of the experiential field to Conscious- ness; it's necessary to pay close attention at this point since, though such key has been outlined in the SC teachings previously it has been given out nowhere else, at no time or place in either spiritual or secular history-and so far there's been demonstrated a tendency on the part of its prospective \"students\" to overlook or undervalue it, there having been no such warning signs as this posted at its previous appearance so that it hasn't been absorbed with the slow sobriety it requires. Borrowing From The Column In The Middle- Limit Lights Out On Its Own (More-Or-Less) \"Limit\", being derivatively dependent on Absolute (as we've seen) and therefore infused with the distinct spirit of Absolute, assays to enjoy the continuity, self-conformance and homogenous self-consistency characteristic of the \"infinite degree\" of Absolute, only on its own delimiting terms! The implications of this oxymoronic effort, acount for all the metaphysical and physical details of manifestation fiom soul to substance and are traced in their coherent/complex extravagance through abstract outline, in the Mother Terasu essays (\"What Is 'Christ Conscious- ness'?\" \"What Is Physics?\" etc.). Our cosmic Nun being properly exhausted by the demonstration, we won't trouble her again as she recuperates at the Lourdes grotto but will simply refer the reader to sources wherein said essays are available (back issues of the New Thunderbird Chronicle, Matrix 11, the projected volumes Compleat New Thunderbird Chronicle and The Mother Book). There are two \"processes\" going on, Logoically speaking, as a consequence of the values implied in Consciousness-as-Absolute-being; and while it's tempting to call them complementary, they are \"non-commutative\" as we've suggested so that they don't read equivalently forward and back. \"Limit\" may be said to assay the infinite consistency, sekonfonnance and homogenous uniformity of Absolute through its own finitizing terms; while Absolute may be said to incorporate that prenatal motion through its own infinitely-integral and innate Unity, in an experimentally comprehensive pattern Logoically organized to enforce the prevailing Reality of that self-same continuity of consciousness under all (potentially disruptive or delimiting) conditions. Thus the apparent cosmic disruption and \"negating\" un-consciousness born of the principle of limit, appears mapped on a magick Trestleboard in a kind of game pattern (Meher Baba's design-version recommended pinball, to the musical wizards of The Who) integrating it to aeonic rotations through a kind of metaphysical anticommutator so as to result (ideally) in a mediating resolution and Return, in confirmation of the eternally prevailing Value of Absolute--adding a \"unit\" of consciousness along the Way thus enriching an otherwise-unimproveable Whole. However--this has already been satisfactorily dispatched, slam-dunked by the Mother in previous exhibition tournaments; we're going to take a little sideroad journey for our present purposes off her main paved track (shifting metaphors as we go), and examine more closely the implications for \"meaning\" and \"value\" in the experiential field with respect to this revealed, abstract impulse informing the principle of limit. Already we see that it constitutes a type of generalized intent; it may be justifiably described aspurpose. Since it presides as a kind ofthetic \"formula\" or abstract standard without-& itself% specific object or defining model (\"Absolute\" is no such model, since it has no necessary predicate) we do not find the patterns of manifestation limited apribri to any identifiable \"drive\" such as libido, id, elan vital etc.-although all such propositions derive fiom interception of the"},{"pageNumber":866,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV abstract impulse by an intuition which attempts to clothe it, and assign it a place within the nature-field (rather than identifiing the nature-field as a reflective expression and specification several times removed, of the initiating abstract impulse). Without predicating a precipitous \"impulse-theory\" such as libido or elan, then, let's inquire as to what such an informing standard relative to the principle of limit might \"look like\" in an abstract way. The Point Alone; The Point Beside Itself; What's Beside The Point? The simplest way to \"model\" infinite homogeneitylself-continuity in conditional terms without prejudicial theorizing, is to inscribe a circle. Although a circle placed on the page is a spatial mark in a plane defining a Zdimensional area in a 34 field (disregarding time, as it isn't an essential component of the figure) we needn't tax the imagination to understand \"circle\" on more purely noetic terms. A circle needn't imply literal area, or literal dimensions in a 3-d space; it's often employed in a purely ideal way (a circle inscribed by the reader around a phrase or paragraph here in order to emphasize the content, is strictly a cipher-it hasn't any metric implication at all, and it's \"read\" abstractly as a highlight boundary). In the same way, the circle or any geometric figure may easily be understood not as a basically visual representation in the spatial field but as a kind of general notation for rhythm, rate, periodicity, ratio, harmony, number, phase etc. It can represent any combination of space andlor time; or it can stand free of space and time as the typology for an aperiodic organizational pattern (in the manner of \"limit attractors\" etc.). Any such figure, regardless its technical inscription in a line, plane or volume, can transcend its provisional medium as a symbol in n number of dimensions, no matter that such additional dimensions can't be conceptualized directly. When we examine the circle, therefore, we must keep in mind that the figure (as well as all derivative properties) is not first of all \"material\", or a material surrogate. It is not wed to or identical with area or volume, metric or scale, or any specifications in time or space. It must be considered for what, ultimately, it is: a noetic (purely abstract, ideal, intelligible) magnitude. For convenience sake we may continue to speak, representationally, in terms of physical properties such as area or volume in order to avoid a contrivance of language--all the while keeping in mind that values even of \"area\" and \"volume\" are symbolic notation of a purely noetic typology. Thus circle gives us a concise figure for the representation of Finitude's \"inborn impulse\"; it demarcates an abstract zone of limit (i.e. we needn't ascribe specific properties to it, such as Boardwaik or Parkplace) while constituting in itself an infinitely homogenous and self-sarne Identity. How so? Note that the circle may be described not only as a continuous closed plane curve every point of which is equidistant fiom a fixed point-enter-within the curve (there is an homogeneity or self-sarne equivalency embedded in this standard dictionary description); it may also be noted that the circle is a continuous closed plane curve any segment of which may be superposed on any other without deviation or distinction in the plane of that curve. It's easy to see that this is a purely noetic property. Nowhere in the spacetime fields of macroscopy or microscopy could this figure be found to exact specification, owing to the displacements of relativity on the one hand and the fractal recessiveness of complex material agencies on the other (even this \"smooth\" page is a terrain of self-involuted bumps and pockets, the more we follow Zeno's logic of \"halving\""},{"pageNumber":867,"pageContent":"like manner. They're not just idealizations of physical measurement; they display first of all the and then \"halving again\" to infinitesimal distances). At this point we may note that the basic geometric figures of Euclid are all noetic, in - - abstract informing standard of the principle of &tarion in general. - Consider the straightline; we may define it similarly to the circle by noting that, as the extension of the point in a single dimension (of breadth, but neither width nor depth), any segment of itself may be superposed on any other without deviation or deformation. This makes line infinitely self-conformant and homogenous with itself, within the confines of its characteristic dimension. Now let's see what happens when we contract the line to its zero-dimensional origin as the point (or, what amounts to the same thing, shrink the circle into coincidence with its common-denominator center, also a non-dimensional point--in the same way that a beach ball exhibits no more dimensions than a grain of sand if we withdraw far enough from it). Such an ideally irreducible point gives us the quintessential term of limit. Being in itself without extension, it is without comparator, even of an identical nature. In relation to the additional dimensions carrying line and curve, the point may be construed as the common denominator locus or collecting set in the assemblage of all allowable positions and parameters. In its own dimension- less state it is not, however, an objective coordinate for the contrastive fields but a persistent reference. Its \"loneness\" as a nondimensional point-presence (persisting in the face of seemingly relational dimensions of line and curve constituting, nonetheless, their own discrete universes defined by their respective dimensions) makes it ultimately non-locatable. The point is, in itself, wholly indeterminate. Since it can't bejixed as a locatable magnitude, the point is indefinitely \"distributed\" or displaced through the whole of being. It is, classically, the \"point which is everywhere\". As pure delimitation, its selfconsistency or infinite homogeneity can only take the form of an indeterminate self-displacement--it has no \"dimension\" through which to enforce its unifomity/selfcontinuity as does line or curve. To be continuous with itself within its characteristic (nondimensional) framework, it must honor that indeterminacy which disallows \"placing\" itself in reference to anything else (while it on the contrary may function as the continuous reference of circle and line). We may say that the Point's location is a negative location, self-consistent only with the essential indeterminacy which arises for a value that must stand alone without reference to anything else. It is then, necessarily, a Self-negation (like the value of Absolute, it has nothing other than itselftoward which to \"apply\" itself; thus, as a delimiting expression, it emulates one of the principal characteristics of Absolute. We may say it \"borrows\" the self-negating applicationfiom Absolute.). Through the sheer self-negation as which the nondirnensional point locus displaces itself indefinitely, that quintessential discontinuous Limit (the prototype of the all-potential of Absolute) succeeds in emulating the infinitely self-conformant and homogenously self-same value of Abso- lute, on its own terms. In order to imagine how this may be so, we must think of the nondimensional character of the point as ubiquitous in itself, rather than as a conditional fixed referent like any period on this page. We may think of the point-presence of Being as a pointillist ocean-- infinitely discontinuous iteration of a non-dimensional root value established through the creative proposition of being, which, owing to its ubiquity and non-locality abides in perfect indistinguishability, so that it is coextensive and infinitely conformant with itself through its own non-dimensional presence"},{"pageNumber":868,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV (even in its abruptly-punctuated discontinuity as the Point). For firrther consideration of this prototypal limit, its implied values and seed-properties, see 'Vhzt is 'Christ Consciountess '? \". The implied values of extension (line, angle, plane, circle, sphere, volume) allow the point-limit to transcend itself in a representative space; its pointillist value may be reflexively coordinated through the extension-accessories implied in its minimalist, contractile finitude. Such coordinate extensors of itself constitute variable, representational compositors through which it is the common referent. As it represents itselfto itselfthrough such reflexively amplifying coordinate extensions, it posits what the unitive homogeneity and conformance of identity would be in reflexively cross-correlating and comparative terms. This is an ideoform identity profile, a contour talung its point-of-departure fiom the point-locus limit and thus comprising its own self-modifying negation. Identity, Identification And The Body Armoire Of The Consciousness Unit With Nothing To Wear We've come to a defnitioml standard as to what \"consciousness\" is; and we've modeled the point-limit in relation to consciousness. As in other contexts (the Mother Terasu essays \"What is 'Christ Consciousness'?\" etc.) the general term \"point\" is used interchangeably as consciousness unit, with tacit understanding that in itself it establishes the root of \"matter\" or universal vital nature. In order to grasp the function of the point in its ultimate relation to the consciousness-standard, it's profitable to maintain implicit recognition of it in operative terms as consciousness unit. (By unit shall be meant a uniform locus acting as coordinate reference, in itself without features but predicating an indefinite \"centrism\" relative to all terms of which it's the referred identity-value.) Such a consciousness unit can function relative to any number of pattenzing types and representational extensor-fields, owing to its innate indeterminacy and abstract presence as undif- ferentiated identity in itself. Depending on the organizational value, degree, density, balance and alignment of the projectively self-representative pattern, the point locus may function as un-, sub-, or self-conscious unit; as the latter it may accommodate a considerable range of functional expression, cognitive grasp, intuitive alignment or direct Self-apprehension. In all cases it makes a holistic claim upon being (in its derivative emulation of absolute) and enforces such claim within the fhunework of its characteristic state, while constituting an empty and self-transcending \"aspirationyy with respect to qualities, states'and dimensions complementary to-d coexistent with-its being, as implication of its delimiting value (i-e. line, circle, volume"},{"pageNumber":869,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV etc.). Such primordial \"aspiration\" points indefinitely beyond its contractile qualification in itself; it is the \"spirit\" with which the consciousness-unit extends its unitive quality in provisional identification through coordinate modifiers, reflected across its orienting centrism. Insofar as the point-presence is equated through such processes with representational types and functions, it my take relative definition within the extended field. In the selfemptied \"eversion\" of its transcendental operator, the point sheds unific \"identity\" over representative projections and is itself projectively paralleled through relative coordinate loci, in the extended plane. Indeterminate in itself, without location or referential comparator (thereby functioning as common referent of all coordinative extensions) the point's indeb y shows up on the representational \"grid\" as relative positionality and comparazive reference. Its parallel in the objective field is that of \"angular locus\", the variable juncture or axial radix of cross-correlating convergence and integration. Its finite extensions give it a dzgerential value; depending on degree of organization it represents at any given \"juncture\", (un-, sub- or self-), such differential value may function as valence (combinative potential), adjustive homeostasis, articulated nerve-network or replete sen- sory-motor \"grid\". The existence of such differential value in the projection field implies at least a nascent capacity for distinction, evaluation, assessment, contrast, preferential alignment and multilateral integration (all properties which upsurge in the field-of-being through the one-dimen- sional extension supplement of Line). The Worm Ouroboros, Or Dinner For One (The Original Bootstrap And Bottleneck Theories) Line constitutes the potential for polarization, relief and recess, the cleavage plane, reflection axis, continuous and broken symmetries (with reference to circle), distancing, measure, comparison and contrasf directionality, valence and vector, alignment, colinear organization and general extensionality. The variables belonging to the differential field, as representative extensors of the point locus, claim the primary projective value of identity without distinction. The identity-value of the consciousness unit first of all informs the components of its projection field, so that the coherent links of its extended functions \"map\" a corresponding contour grid of mirroring unities, conform- able integrities and whole identity-forms. The value of identity is carried through as processes of idenrifcation, in the repre- sentational field. The \"selhess\" of the indivisible identity-value inspiriting the basic point predi- cation, is homogeneously dimibuted across' the plane of the projection field; the coherently superposed functions and comparative integrities drawn into relief-configurations through that field, first of all receive the whole (internally self-conformant) value of identity without distinction, . . apportionment or discnrmnationfi.om the identity-value of the point locus. Secondaq differentials, applying toward the continuity and persisting integrity of the organizational complex (representing the whole-being identity of the consciousness unit on the comparative and contrastive plane), generate values of discrimination in maintenance of such abstractlideal identity-continuity on contingent terms. The contingency of self-representational existence (requiring the contour of formal characterization, so as to have a distinguishable identity"},{"pageNumber":870,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV to conserve) employs the differential factor as navigational rudder, a discriminative \"advisor\" weighing intensity values, relative alignment harmonies and integration-models through the sets of complementary variables and systemic operators mutually implicated to infinity. At such primary level, the distribution of identity-value remains uniform; the discrimi- nations take place at the vital level of being strictly as assessments of relative harmony or inbannony in the potential combinations, unifications or adjustments of coherently-superposed identities. The representational integrities of the field (though contingency-generated as comple- mentary potentials forming grid patterns of angular variables, \"breaking\" differentially according to complex combination), take their discrete if overlapping coherencies uniformly hm the point locus of identity with reference to which they function. They are only discriminated into selfhot self many steps and intensity-values of psychic functioning ahead on the developmental agenda; at the vital level they are all homogeneously self-same as forms of identity, only differentiated by degree of comparative harmony or dissonance in sening the implicit contingencyfcontinuity of the point-identity for which they function as definitional operators either positively or negatively. Thus the contingency and organizationally contrastive condition accompanying the delimited projection-field carries \"impartial\" identity-value to complementary sets of operators, mutually conditioned and modifying pattern-variables etc.; so that while, as phases and potentials in the critical organization of identity-continuity in contingent terms such variables may be assigned \"positive\" or \"negative\" value, they coexist as identities of the point-locus reference without discrimination or contrastive qualification. They remain, at that basic level, equipotential insofkr as the value of identity is concerned. . . Owing to such uniform identity-value amongst discnrmnated quantities (with respect to the instrumental \"profile\" of the point's extension-accessories patterning the projective field) the relative polarization alignments produced according to discrete f;mctionaI charge tend to exhibit congenital instability-much as a politically mandatory choice of one over another equally-valued lover, carries forward stickily rebalancing relationships after the \"discrimination\" is technically made. Here we may understand 'hstnmrental profile\" as the molecular configuation of an element or compound, the tentacular cavitation of coelenterates, the ganglionic networks of man and beast, the pseudopods of amoebae, cilia of the protozoan, the feelers of crab or inchworm, antennae of ant or the stalks of ticks, fleas, lmal forms and vegetative life in general; and by the \"discriminated quantities\" with \"discrete functional charge\" we may understand anything that is moved through, lived in, ingested, rejected, incorporated, combined with or eaten by the above. The self-idem@ of differentiated terms--modes, patterns, processes-generates recip- rocal modification of their respective value-assignments under stress of organizational preference, or selective polarization. The adaptive incorporationlfiltering of discrete functional modes possess- ing uniform identipvalue borrowed against the common point locus, necessarily produces a self-displacement or mutual inversion of the exchange-values under which such properties con- ducted the original alignments. The perfectly equivalent serving of the point-locus identity projection by all sets of complementary operators causes every form of functional negation (as in filtrate processes of selection, sorting, valence-bonding etc.) to be in effect a self-negation. The coinherence, mutuality and identity-equivalence of all differential operators with the point locus as common referent, produces in effect a continuous ratio modification or shifting proportion in the interaction of the"},{"pageNumber":871,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV components--as if each successive configuration tending toward internal stabilization/continuity of the \"instrumental profile\" (claiming the whole-value of identity, as a differential operator) grudgingly displaces itself into a changed proportion of relative instability requiring compensatory coordinate alignments as the result of having the \"whole\" of its identity-value inextricably shared with the negated counterpart--thus rendered as a functionalfi.action even while claiming &ted integer status, in effect being smuggled out fiom under its aspirationally-unitive embrace with the \"missing\" part swapped for a token emblemizing the \"negated\" term within itself, in some altered-ratio of their initial exchange values.* (This is the same as to say that, through any instrumental process at any level, on any scale or at any degree of intensity the total value equal to unity is conserved, while the component representations of that unity enforce such conservation as htional operators reciprocally modi- fying their proportions in adjustive ratios about the fixed mean--the void-unity point limit of being. By this we refer to the unity of indefinitely extensive systems; we don't draw an arbitrary line of demarcation around any zone of the pattern though we may recognize the legitimate entity-status of any given, functional locus of the pattern; we certainly subscribe to the potential of delivering energy values \"above unity\" for a given, descriptively limited system.) The Moebius Mystery Of \"Mew- Exploring The Seamless Surface Of Self-Reference The behavior of all such (indefinitely extensive) systems, is directly related to the phenomenon of the so-called self-reference paradox. While we have modeled this paradox (of incessant self-modification through reciprocally invertible terms) without explicit reference to the value of self-consciousness, the root of the self-conscious referential paradox is embedded in the model. Note, however--the mechanism of such incessant self-modification doesn't depend on the explicit presence of self-consciousness. It implies the latter, but functions equally at un-, sub- and proto-conscious levels. To refiesh the memory as to just what the famous self-reference paradox is: ''this statement is false\", is the prototype expression generally used to characterize the self-reference paradox fiom classical logic. It is hmed in the form of first-person (\"I\", i.e. ''this thisment\") categorical negative (\"is false\"). This means basically that, in @inning what it is, it simultaneously negates what it is. Immediately one can see the connection to our point-locus models given above, in which contrastive tern of an homogenous identity were in eflect given the function of assigning reciprocally vetoing values to one another through an operation of mutually exclusive self-selection. * One need only think of the Tai-Chi symbol, wherein the black \"paisley\" countercharge sits inside the white and vice versa, comprising a miniature whole in itself yet constituting afiuction of the background form in which it's embedded; this effectually fractionates the overall area belonging to the greater munter as well, so that they subsist as coinhering mirror proportions of one another causing the perfectly equilibrated halves to exist as inverse ratios; another exchangesperation conducted under the same trigonometric formula that produced the fim, would alter the respective proportions again since each operator is at the same time inevitably applied toward itself. Depending on the initial exchange-proportions this could stabilizesut at a certain flux rate; it could cause the charges to b'wiud around\" one another in endless counterpoint of increase-decrease; or it could produce a predictable periodicity of recessive/dominant \"generations\", as in genetic behaviors."},{"pageNumber":872,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Their common identi@ as contrastive representations of the point-locus, cause that seemingly innocuous assignment to behave ... strangely. In the same way, \"This statement is false\" seems completely unresolvable in terms of classical logic. It generates an incessant selfcancelling fluctuation, like a \"perpetual motion machine\" of the cognitive processes: if it's true, it's false, yet if it's false it's true by its own self-defmition, ad infintum. The basis of such a paradox doesn't lie in secondary forms of conceptualization; it isn't a problem deprived of a sufficient number of dimensions in which to solve it. Rather, it originates in a basic condition-of-being which is seldom properly analyzed to begin with. Its adequate revelation may be given through perfectly ordinary forms of self-reflective consciousness. The principle ,involved here is discussed more thoroughly in terms of its psychological implications, in \"LogodAnti-Logos 11\"; its philosophical substrate is examined for basic elements in the Mother Terasu essay \"What is 'Christ Consciousness'?\" part 11. For the present, we need ody request that a few simple observations be duplicated in order to get the idea. Indeed, it's idea with which we're concerned. The Self-reference paradox takes root in the fact that all cognitiodperception is ideoform to begin with. This coined term* is meant to apply in all cases whether reflexive or nonreflexive. Therefore it's meant to suggest that the perceptible universe isn't just the concrete pointsf-departure for subjectively reflective and secondary ideas about it, but that it is of the essential nature of idea to begin with. Why It's Getting Harder To Say You Can't Come Up With A Single Idea Rather than resort to specialized, difficult \"mystical realms\" for some rarefied substan- tiation largely beyond the reader's grasp in any case, we should be able to find all causative values and cosmogonic principles operating under the given circumstance regardless the level at which such circumstance discharges. There should be, on principle, nothing in the causative cosmos which isn't reflected and recapitulated at any and every point in the manifestation. Each operator of the origin should be equally present in the form of all its specific occasions; this in itself is an eternally sdlicient \"mysticism\" for it asks us to identify the causative factors of all processes in the moment, as it blooms, rather than being many steps removed in \"time\" or \"space\" through a chain of cascading effects. Though the causal state in itselfmay have a pure universe to which it corresponds, all the fonns issuing therefrom take place as elaborations \"fiom the center outward\", as it were, rather than by successive linear extractions. Therefore we \"up the ante\" on the recommendation of science that we should be able to find the \"fossilized\" evidence, the fingerprints or lingering tracks of cause still echoing fiom ancient origins; we insist on intensifiing that expectation to the point of real mysticism, where the present moment is sufficient basis for the living revelation of cause, catching dinosaur \"first principles\" as currentIy operative factors quite spry for relics and renewably * For the Platonists, idea and form were equated in any case.

When we say, therefore, that all things are ideofonn to begin with, we directly challenge the reader to interrogate all factors in the moment. Note the way in which common perceptual objects disclose themselves immediately as intelligible wholes, coherent unific identities imbued with available meaning and charged value-potential. Regardless the diverse features into which any given phenomenon may be analyzed, there are integrities or discrete unific qualities to all such identifiable features as well as to the aggregate phenomenon in question. (A \"rock\" may be analyzed in terms of its composition, its shape or color, the shadow and highlight in the irregularity of its fms, its mineral traces, its geologic striations, its weight and balance as a potential projectile and still retain its immediately graspable self-identity as rock all the while other forms of identity, viable in their own right, map their interparticipatory role in the reality of \"rock\".) Though the compositional traits of processes and things may interpenetrate, overlap, share features, bleed into one another, cast reciprocal \"shadows\" through self-sufficiencies of form they don't lapse into indistinguishable homogeneity or an indefinite \"dust\" of contributory elements. Even the perennial effort to pare the whole down to the finest part continues to yield discrete identities, thetically distinguishable owing to the persistent coherency and reiterated \"wholeness\" with which everything conjugates. The objection may be raised on \"psychological\" grounds, that such discrete identity and wholeness is demonstrably the result of leanzing and memory, and doesn't spring full blown into existence like rigid \"categories\" or a priori \"ideas\". However, precisely by recognizing that rigid categories and ideas don't accompany consciousness into existence as so many prefabricated components to be stuck like colored pins to the board, we may perceive the operation of a universal tendency; and it is this tendency which makes the whole living rather than schematic, flexible and of dynamiclopen-ended potential rather than predetermined and closed. The fact of our present roster of objects and phenomena being the variable result of leaming-patterns, individuated memory-formation etc. doesn't quit telling us something about identity and consciousness in favor of neurochemistry and sociology; on the contrary it shows conclusively that processes of learning and memory are themselves infonned by a universal tendency toward identification of wholes. We currently call this \"pattern-recognition\"; but it can easily be lost sight of, that the value to be identified in the gestalt of any pattern is identity itself. There is a driving spirit toward the identification of intelligible wholes; and such wholes are constituted by the value of identity. The informing abstract unity and ideal self-congruence which is the innate accompaniment of consciousness into the field of its \"finitizing\" potential, applies itselfwith respect to a contingent phenomenology of mutually-conditioning comparators. Once correctly \"focused\", it should be self-evident that the \"discrete wholes\" into which phenomena tend to sort through perceptual/cog- nitive processes are immediately ideofonn, without the requirement of self-reflective conceptuali- zation; for each such whole (the desk, the sound of the fan, the papers, the window, the odor of teak, the trees and the tambourine tremor of their leaves) discloses itself as a unific intelligibility, an abstract homogenous integrity regardless the diverse specification of composing \"features\"--it is an immediately apprehensible identity, abstractly whole under all participatory qualities and of presentational value owing to its distinguishable self-congruence (as a complex compositor group- ing sets of variables to a common tern). Every such phenomenon is an immediate abstract identity; and the ground of both"},{"pageNumber":874,"pageContent":"MATRIX N agreement and discrepancy (which distinguishes the phenomenon as a shared term, and as a stylized reflection of personal memory-readings with their associations and reflexes etc.) may be identified as the patterning tendency of the phenomenological field as a whole, informed by the universal value of conscious self-congruence and indivisible identity projected through a perspectival locus participating as an angulated factor of the pattern. (This is a description of yourself, in case you didn't realize it.) Note that \"misidentifications\" with respect to agreed-upon functional integrities may certainly occur. One may mistake a hatrack in the dark for an intruder, a tree-shadow on the highway for a deer; or the ancient Egyptian magician-as well as the modem fakir-may exercise little- known feats of mass \"hypnotism\" to persuade the perception of a rod in conformance with the traits of a snake. Nonetheless the \"illusory\" identification is as much a function of the ideoform immediacy of things as is that of more functionally-appropriate forms; the only thing at issue is the tendency to perceive intelligible wholes. If I mistake a rod for a serpent, the perceptual accuracy is insignificant in comparison to the persisting bare fact of intelligible form; \"serpent\" continues to convey an immediate abstract meaning, significance and intelligible identity, charged with impli- cation and psychic nuance as a symbolically representational function of whole-being identity itself. Wherein The Sassani Get Psyched-Out (Or, What's That Aurora-Aura Surrounding Your Monotone Meanings?) This observation should, in itself, help relieve a large part of the burden imposed by the Sassani \"philosophy\": first of all the fact that the comparatively \"illusory\" and relatively \"real\" may still be distinguished in terms of tenacious functional consistencies, suggests an operative order of qualitatively dzferentiated values. Even if, as the Sassani would have it, meanings were arbitrarily interchangeable against a \"neutral background field\", the clear functional differentiation of meaning with respect to imaginatively coherent real prehensions and imaginary prehensions leaves us in a qualitatively hierarchic world. And as we shall see, we're left in such a world for a reason. The presence of such a differential factor has operative significance for the whole, which the Sassani postulate clearly throws out the window. Secondly, the very fact that phenomenological qualities model the congruence of identity value as sev-symbolizing function (in relation to the standard of conscious continuity against which they borrow) signifies strongly that \"meanings\", while elastic and variable within a given phenome- nal range, can't be arbitrarily interchangeable to an indefinite degree. Their symbolic character conveys the value of the structure through which they come to being, as a function of the relation between the whole-being value of consciousness and its contingently representative terms. Thus again, \"meanings\" can't inhere arbitrarily in consciousness or be tossed off extemporaneously by consciousness; rather they arise in the relation between consciousness and the experiential field, and arejirnctions of that relation. As with previous examples of this principle, think of the aforementioned \"hallucinated\" serpent. Imagined or not, real or not in any given case, \"serpent\" like all other phenomenological expressions has a place in the dream mind. What kinds of impressions does \"serpent\" convey? What mode of consciousness, or of being-in-general, does it illustrate? Are its suggestive meanings infinitely arbitrary? It should be apparent that, with every phenomenon, there is a psychic structure to its"},{"pageNumber":875,"pageContent":"presence; it doesn't exist as a simple ad hoc \"meaning\" without rootedness. The psychic structure through which it expresses, is a development ofthe relation between consciousness and the delimited creative field, but it gives no precedence to either term within itself; rather, it's the expressive function of that relationship. The world is a psychic phenomenon. The relation between conscious- ness and the creative field generates existence as a p.sychic pattern. The arbitrary interchangeability of \"meanings\" in the Sassani philosophy, allows no place for such meanings as psychic pattern. Indeed, it simply dichotomizes \"consciousness\" and the \"neutral creative field\". It produces a philosophical dualism precisely by stripping reality of its psychic content. We may now recognize that, regardless the interpreted processes through which the phenomenological field is patterned as \"cognitive venue\" (i.e. sense organs, neurochemistry, biomolecular order etc.) the indefatigable tendency to identify discrete \"wholes\" in the changing complexes of the pattern points to the influence of consciousness as the enabling means. The whole-being congruency of consciousness (in its ideal state) imparts its value to representational loci of the phenomenal field. The tendency to distinguish discrete object-content and coherent form is directly attributable to the sympathetic presence of (implicit) whole-being consciousness inter- preting its value of indivisible \"selfhess\" through coordinative correspondences, in identification of potential self-revelatory \"modes\" of being. All such ideofom wholes take their abstract intelligibility and integrally-meaningful quality from the unijjing/abstract selfitess through which they're cognized. Therefore the immediate psychic value, intelligibility and coherent-ideofom persuasiveness of the phenomenological fields owe their character to the whole-being identity against which they borrow, and through which they're cognized. The discrete holistic disclosures as wbich the experiential pattern renders itselfin consciousness, are first of all seIfdisclosures. They model potential modes of selfitess, outline the patterns and projects as which whole-being value may represent itself to itself.* - -- - *This does no& however, authorize the logical jump promoted by modern commentators such as Robert Anton Wilson, Ken Wilber etc., to the effect that reality is \"really\" process, and the tendency to \"entification\" of the phenomenal field is strictly attributable to fhkification through hypemophy of a lobe, or accounted by liiizing the implications in sentence-di , g. \"Tni\" grammars invoked to illustrate altcmative syntax, actually prove the opposite point: \"walking-cat\", \"sleepingcat\", \"huntingcat\" etc., while admirably unifying being and process in behavioral tableaus identifying dynamic modes rather than static objects abstracted limn their functions, nonetheless continue in the service of dimete wholes. Coherent boundaries don't dissolve into an amorphous gruel for tribal consciousness; such syntactical basis for \"cognitive grammars\" may be presumed more \"subtle\", as indicating a superior ratio in the interaction of cerebral hemispheres-it hardly vitiates the durable tendency in the perception of distinguishable wholes, the objectification of abstractly-illumined or discrerely highlighted form etc. \"Selhess\" isn't simply a one-way projection from the background (whole-being) presence of consciousness, upon a field of process otherwise unlike the value through which it's interpreted. The abstract sefiess of conscious-presence finds its phenomenological correlative by a sympathetic correspondence; the indeterminate point locus of consciousness has its representational counterpart in the relative coordinate loci of the patterning field. Its indeterminacy is translated as ''relativity\" in that field. The correspondence is reciprocal, so that the formula \"I am to you, as you are to me\" comprises philosophical justification for turning down the hypothesis of solipsism (as well as furnishes the basis for lyrics in \"I Am The Walrus\"). The intensification of such loci through informing consciousness-units to varying degrees of functional intelligibility, orders a representative instrumentarion that necessarily sbes the ground with all such coinhering complexes of projective instrumentality (whether the intelligible degree warrants a \"fern\", a \"June bug\", a \"hydrogen atom\", a \"Hottentot\" or an \"investment"},{"pageNumber":876,"pageContent":"MATRIX N This initial value of the perceptual venue tends to be masked and practically lost, as developmental processes of the self-reflective identification pattern superimpose forms of identity equated more rigidly with the differentials of faculty andfirnction. Designing The Psychological Format For The Self-Wrestling Floormat To infant consciousness there's aprimary selfhess in the identities of all phenomenologi- cal impression: that round object, that play of light and shadow, the yielding touch of this cushion are equally self-revelatory. They disclose potential modes in the continuity of identity. All such phenomena are, initially, the interpretive identity-of-being, without discrimination between subject- instrument and object-impression. Such phenomenological unity gradually yields to psychological equations, strategically subdividing the candidate self-representatives of the field into memory-complexes of sewnot-self. Thus arises a kind of \"psychological pragmatism\"; equations of relative harmony and inharmony generate symbol--ties, behaviorally enacted, which in any given case may or may not promote \"objective\" well-being as assessed by strictly survivalist standard but which in every case uniformly reflect the stylized self-description whereby the psyche intends to enforce congruence of identity. It must here be understood that such ideal congruence of identity, inspirited by the whole-being standard, represents symbolically a sufficient harmony in itself without reference to \"objective\" measurement. Thus the emergent ego-ideal characterizing a given psychic complex (functioning on the drscnrmnato . .. ry subdivisions--seWnot-self-of the psychological process) models a desirable harmony strictly as a standard of consistency, regardless the \"positive\" or \"negative\" typology it has learned tq project as sufficient self-representation. Thus the egocomplex may model itself as a \"successful achiever\" or \"luckless failure\"; the tenacity with which either image is advantaged in a given case, indicates the decisive value for secondary psychological processes to be that of simple congruency, enforced through the differential operator of sewnot-self as an identity pro$le. (For further application of these principles to the theory of psychological development, see LogodAnti-logos II.) The important thing to recognize here, is that such subsequent psychological processes are indeed secondary. They mask the original condition of identifying self-reference through the phenomenological field, but they don't terminate it. The initial state of phenomenological \"self- ness\" persists underneath the derivative operations which assign secondary values dism .. . g \"self' fiom \"other\". It remains irreducibly the case that all such discriminations are enabled against a tacit self-valuation. The given objee concept, impression etc. must first disclose itself as the potential for adequate self representation; it models a potential for whole-being identity, in conditional terms (amongst many other things, this describes the mechanism that's basis for the phenomenon-perennially vexing to the explanations of conventional psychiatry-as to how a personality may emulate to the degree of incorporating those traits belonging to one embodying the most intense anti-values of the given personality). counselor\").

Yet either possibility continues to belong, obviously, to a particular side of one-and-the-same ledger, that of the identity-inventory (ideal ego image).

As we've had occasion to explain often before, all such formulations of a \"personal psychic reality\" take place with implicit reference to a whole-being standard4e first-order operations of that standard, as we may now see, occurring on theprimary level ofphenomenoZogical identiq (without self-awareness of its own state, in the case of the infant-psyche); that level is already many times removed into an obscure \"subconscious background\" where its curious coinherence- of-opposites erupts in the ambiguity of dream-imagery, and is effectually replaced by stress-induc- ing internal contradictions of the ordinary psychological complex chronically throwing off its \"not-self' like a rebounding yo-yo.

This \"you\" is simply the unrequited ego, addressed at its own level in the perennial hope of iidfibg its self-contradictory model, and will therefore only \"create\" what it's used to creating. What can its model of such a newly-efficacious creation be, other than the model to which it's long accustomed and from which it would never depart owing to sheer force of identified habituation? If the Basharphile object that the Sassani are \"really\" or ultimately addressing the primary level, that of identitycontinuity with the phenomenological field, so as to draw it into progressive awareness on the mounting success of reality-creations incorporating a more inclusive character, we must disallow that objection on purely evidential grounds. Since we've seen how the Sassani \"philosophy\" drains the psychic character out of being so as to leave a sterile dichotomy between a consciousness-of-meanings and the \"neutral\" field, we have no evidence whatsoever that the Sassani recognize or honor any such primq state at all, existing prior to the division sewnot-self. The Sassani description ultimately gives credence to, and constructs philo- sophically, only the level at which the ordinary ego is already functioning. And there's no way at all to \"get from here to there\", if the recommended modus operandi effectually participates at only the secon&ry level. (Remember, the Sassani's \"neutral experiential field\" doesn't warrant any benefit-of-the-doubt supposition-4.e. that it refers to some underlying homogeneity-of-identity fiom which objects may receive their \"selfhess\", since it is clearly distinguished from and posited over-against a ready--and unexplained-' 'coflsciousness-of-meanings' .) Indeed if one were \"already\" functioning in the framework of initiated consciousness, the fact of the Bashar-philosophy on& addressing and participating in the secondary dichotomous level of ego-psychology would be immediately evident from the epigrammatic summation of such philosophy alone, i.e. precisely the give-away proclamation 'you create your own reality\".

Let's see if there's a suflcient reason for the special reservation placed upon occult understanding of causes in the production of material effect. The only way we can test the hypothesis, is to apply the correct princz$es in an effective manner. The secret of \"producing a targeted effect\" without obvious physical intervention in any ordinary sense, of bending the universe-at-large in conformance with one's will, as it were, is in itself relatively simple and straightforward. The entire principle is based on the implicit function of the nature-current and all its energy fields as... a habit-pattern. That's it. Here It Is! Here It Is! How to Get Everything You Want, Always Wanted and Ever Will Want- And Still Honor Your Basic Mi-Contentement We're familiar enough with our \"personal\" biophysiology operating in this manner. We may say that the memory-code of our very DNA is a \"habit pattern\"; and we understand our sensory-motor facility, our linguistic faculty etc. as developments of a conditioning process very identifiable as habit-pattern. We know how it is that habit-pattern is based upon concerted repetition so that what originates as \"methodical deliberateness\" becomes progressively less dependent on conscious focus, ultimately exhibiting very fluid, spontaneous and even versatile response-pattern as subconscious behaviors. The line of influence always flows from the consciousness-systems to the autonomic systems; the suggestive power which subconscious processes seem to exert on consciousness always originates fiom the conscious level, is tacitly approved and re-accepted by that level each time its subtle impressions circulate through.

What is not so well known, is that the nature pattern at large continues toficnction as just such a habit pattem. The nature-pattern-at-large is comprised of the same responsive fields, currents and compositional elements as the autonomic systems of your \"personal\" aura; they exist in holonomic relation to one another. Your mind/body being is a multidimensional current-pattern of regulatory \"loci\" (the chakras, endocrine complex etc.) distributed vertically through the resolving Axis of the \"World-line\" (in flatheductive terms of physical representation, the cerebrospinal column). The nature fields comprise reflective and responsive world extensions of the informing, psychic atmospheres aligning and orienting their multidimensional current patterns. / The function of those extended fields is masked as responsive habit pattern (to 3rd density consciousness) only because, once the impressional current moves along corresponding world-lines beyond the personal \"health aura\" its ordering effects are obscured from the available range of consciouscontinuity; the myriad consequences of its cohering, magneto-electric codes pass outside the focused flow of attention and defeat the ordinary faculty to follow, becoming lost in the intervening curtain of impressions and distractive sensations separating the initial, cognitive \"authorization\" fiom its eventual returncurrent of corresponding \"effectw--in the meanwhile sent into the world to have its characteristic signature coordinated, reinforced, qualified and standardized through encounter with contemporary impressional currents bearing similar signatures. (See essay \"Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality\".) Armed with this key, let's influence the \"world at large\" to respond as our magnified habit pattern. We will then be exercising what has previously been denominated \"magick\". (Unbeknownst to us, the world's been behaving this way all along. It's just that, as Freud observed of ordinary habits, they're generally compulsive, subconsciously-elaborated ''tahmam\" or sym- bolical \"comforters\", protective reflex devices employed through the psychic equations to ''ward off' potential for schism and distress locked into unresolved elements of the mental complex; extended to the processes of the nature-field at large, the experience we receive as reflective habit-pattern of our predominant psychic coniiguration manifests a chronic behavioral neurosis which we're required to interpret as \"accident\", \"circumstances beyond our control\", \"the impersonal adversity of existence\", the contrary \"death-instinct\" etc.) In order to induce the world-at-large to kction as the express genie of our habit-pattern, we must target some particular thing (goal, dream, desire, ambition, need etc.) and focus it with the absorbed interest characterizing the most successful matter of our ordinary habit-patterns. There- fore: select a particular goal. If your requirements are actually complex, find the core of that complex. Pare the complexity down to a simple and single denominator. If it turns out such streamlining leads to a generalization, convert the abstraction (whether \"money\", \"fame\", \"love\" etc.) to a concrete tenn. State the goal to yourself as something visrcalizable, as well as something specific that can be afEmed in a simple sentence. (\"The mailbox is stuffed with checks\", \"the bed is filled with lovers\"--for experimental purposes, don't fear being \"crass\"; if you frame your goal in coquettish or inhibitively demure terms, the universe will give back its reflection in just such \"euphemistic\" form. We are, after all, attempting experimentally to determine if this works, no? Extravagance shouldn't be a prohibitive consideration in itself, as long as the stated object belongs to a general world of realizable states comprising the common framework of your recognition- don't hypothesize as a test case \"I walk the planes of Aldebaran\" ... although, considering the current state of affairs such a proposition might well prove disconcertingly within range of one's grasp after"},{"pageNumber":881,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV all! So take care, in this little \"experiment in thaumaturgy\"...) Having selected your \"target\", which should constitute a kind of core or common denominator for your related wishes and needs etc., write it down. Make it concrete immediately by stating it, on paper. Frame a simple sentence using the above models, as ative expression of your goal. Use the common \"metaphysical\" counsel to state it in the \"present tense\"; visualize or imagiie it as presently occurring, so as not to instruct the naturecurrent inadvertently to place it on perpetual postponement in some inexistent \"future\" tense (the Saki of the nature-current is notoriously literalistic, in the way that a computer doesn't seem to grasp the nuance of meaning, or to \"get the idea\" so as to round off obligingly to the nearest desired or implied approximation). Having crystallized your aim in this fashion, you should never neglect practicality; the \"current\" won't help those who won't help themselves, who can't be bothered or don't feel their own practical input is--or should be-ecessary. Taking practical measures isn't a \"cheat\" to our experiment. We all know how often \"practical measures\" by themselves prove to be inadequate. You've probably already taken \"practical measures\" to one degree or another, if your formulated goal really reflects something true to your heart's desire-for you should have been lusting after it long before now. \"Experience\" teaches us that \"practical measures\" by themselves can't seem to take into account the factors of timing, luck etc. Our employment of \"practical measures\" is here of a slightly different purpose. By heeding the standard \"Personal Power\" fonnat of writing down a step-by-step gameplan, determining first of all those things which are within your personal range to implement or use etc. you are \"showing\" the Sakti of the naturecurrent by example. Through real actions and \"decisions\", as it's said, you set a sort of standard by way of your own energy-patterns, gradually engraving the intent and aggregate motion into the extended nature-cur- rent. In the very same way, you \"set an example\" for the personal and then the universal Sakicurrent when you learn to walk, to speak, to ride a bike, to drive a car etc. Your first conscious efforts to imitate the pattern of speech, the movements of walking or driving are elaborate, laborious, unaccustomed, comparatively clumsy ... But by procedurally rehearsing these things over and over consciously, you engrave a particular intent into the personal and then the universal nature-pattern (the \"autonomic currents\" of the micro-and macrocosmic lifeforce). As an important sidebar to understanding how this works, modern neurobiology and related disciplines have disproved the old idea that specific behavior-patterns become encoded in the neurochemistry; the updated viewpoint is that the intent or aim is recorded through the patterning processes, which leaves their specific implementation to a versatile range of alternative behavioral and biochemical lockups. In the same way, the Sakti of the nature-current will pick up your overall intent the more efficiently as you actually attempt to implement the goal through available practical means. No practical avenue should be neglected. (If you can write letters of intent to appropriate parties informing them of your desire for the job, proposing in outline the model for your revolutionary new invention etc. such steps should be taken after a sufficient self-protective research.)

This can range from the simple but effective device of taping notes to bureau and car mirror, refrigerator door and hallway entrances to the confection of some vividevocative symbol of the aim (if you're astrologically-inclined, the glyph of Jupiter might serve to emblemize your drive for wealth or well-being) which may be painted, hung on walls at home or at work, hammered into earrings or other jewelry to serve as intimate adornment flashing and jingling little subliminal stimulations to continuous, mnemonic reflection ... the very act of painting the image, crafting the artifact serves the ancient function of talismanic embodiment in the energetic (not the Freudianlneu- rotic) sense, in the same way that the time, care and energy taken by the old wizards and shamans in preparing their instruments contributed a large part of the practical charge vivifying the actual ritual. You should find formal moments during your day, preferably routinized so as to coincide day to &y with approximately the same times and for participation in the same (sanctified) place, in which you close your eyes, visualize your selected goal-emblem in its associated color inwardly"},{"pageNumber":883,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV at the \"third eye\" center (the effective occult \"locus\" for gener- ating fertile thought-patterns) and charge the image by concen- tration with a series of fill charger breaths (see Charger Breathing section). This practice may be applied just a few minutes, preferably some time in early morning, then early afternoon where feasible, and shortly before going to bed at night so that the impression of the emblemized goal lingers at the third-eye center in accompaniment of consciousness through the gestatory medium of sleep and dream. Metaphysicians and esotericists go so far as to prac- tice \"awakening in the dreamstate\" that they may consciody install the condensed typology of their goal (image, affirmative statement, symbolic emblem etc.) directly into the fertile \"sub- conscious\" of the oneiric medium, so as to accelerate the process of \"dreaming true\". You needn't cany it this far (although nothing's stopping yoq if you're that ambitious); the charging practice at the third-eye center serves much the same purpose, and is very \"direct\" in its way. In all this, it should be noticed that ambition is the winning value. You can't pretend to be \"cool in desireless bliss-consciousness\" as so many love to conceive themselves, and still be on fire with a suflicient purpose to realize your aim (you may impress others with your \"new age\" posturing, but you're telling your own Sakti two contradictory things so that you'll likely realize neither). You must be on fire with your purpose, else how will you manage to excite the Sakti to an adequate organizational and overriding-accelerative level? In- deed if your object doesn't kindle your sustained enthusiasm with a drive equivalent to the intensity of sexual hunger, chances are you've conceived your targeted object with a dry rationalization of what you \"ought to have\" as most IogicaIIy necessary. This is no way to realize your aim. Intellectual calculation has to be accompanied by an equivalent real hunger of the ego to dominate those abstractly formulated goals, in order for the nature-pattern to receive an impelling instruction. If your aim is sexual in the first place of course, it's liable to have the appropriate \"sustained enthusiasm\". If how- ever you find, after due consideration, that the goal you feel you \"want\" doesn't kindle your excitement on a moment's notice, you may wish either to reassess what you'll be using as a core aim, or you may choose to resort to an old occult trick (which Monty's in just the mood to let out of the Templar bag). If after careful assessment you still wish to retain your \"dry\" aim, you should find a way (or many ways) to couple it by association to a style of sexualized thinking which causes it to be accompanied"},{"pageNumber":884,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV by a strong desire-charge whenever it's invoked. This method, perfectly Pavlovian, nonetheless works. There need not be any logical connection between the goal and the sexualized imagery to which you fuse it in your imagination. For example, if you feel the key to all your success-in-life hinges on landing a particular position in the company for which you work, yet this aim-in itselfis so dryly pragmatic it fails to generate the requisite enthusiasm when you turn to \"encourage\" its corresponding Sakti, you may imagine quite arbitrarily that the aim is a desirable man or desirable womanyour choice, go with the flow-with whom you're \"presently\" having intercourse. Your sexualized personification may be imagined as \"wearing the emblem\" of your aim in the form of jewelry, a prominent tattoo etc. to reinforce your remembrance graphically. The only connection between your real goal and its sexualized personification is the one you establish in your imagination; but it's sufficient. The dream-mind, after all, does something similar very often where an abstract idea is given representational embodiment in a vivid but seemingly capricious way. On the other hand such arbitrariness may \"bother\" you and thus interfere with your evocation (if you're the overly logical type, or a Virgo) so you may wish to establish a formulaic or symbolic link between your abstract aim and its vivid sexualized counterpart. This is up to your ingenuity, of course, but the effort made imparts its own additional energy to the momentum of the impres- sioned Sadi-current. For example, if the department with which you seek the desired position is Business Reporting, Accounting and Statistics an acronym compresses it to the handy mnemonic of \"BREAST\" (hey, don't blame Monty! you said you wanted to know. ..) To paraphrase a comedian seen recently on Live At The Improv, \"You know how when you're wallcing down the street and all of a sudden you start getling sweaty palms 'cause the awning on the jewelry store resembles a miniskirt, and you start salivating from the phallic shape of the fire hydrant and the curvature of the Lamborghini on the comer and the parking meters start getting you hot and you practically explode when someone opens a nearby door just a crack ...y ou know ... doesn't that happen to you all the time too?\" Being Everything You Can Be: Having Your K And Eating It 2 (Or, Don't You Distrust Even A Little Any New Age Canard That's Used As A Military Recruitment Slogan?) You should continue in the various forms of goal-conjuration at least until you've accomplished a minimum level of success, according to your own standards. We strongly recom- mend that you do this experiment, if indeed you're smitten by the implied power and promise of such propositions as \"YCYOR suggesting heretofore mimagimble dimensions to your efficacy, and at the same time find yourself tending to resent any contradiction (as this present one) placing an apparently prohibitive or cautionary hand in front of that wonderlid just-opened view.

Should you apply yourself diligently to the principles outlined here and follow the suggested steps, you will indeed realize the acme of all that can be realized in the idea of \"personal reality creation\". Therefore you'll be in a real position to understand our further discussion exploring the limits of the idea itself and the errors of its philosophical presumptions--after all, you can't really convince someone without knowledge of physics or optical principles that climbing to the top of K-2 won't allow him to touch the sky, though peak and ozone smly look convergent to the untrained glance at groundlevel. You must give him the practical experience of learning to mountainclimb so that, at the real frozen summit he may say \"oh, that's what you meant\". This appears to be the only way to address certain types who, with hope kindled and wildly encouraged by the promise of YCYOR yet having scarce experience in realizing even rudimentary forms of its implication, resent (to the point of boiling irrationality) any intimation that this premise may not be true. So: succeeti, succeed; please. Then, perhaps we may speak further to one another. Getting In The Habit: Reflections From Our Cosmic NUN In the meanwhile, keep in mind that the progressive cultivation of this ritualized goal-orientation as a personal habit pattern, results in its engraving and issuance through the universal field of the nature-current. This means though that in order to bring you what you wish, the Saki must get in the habit. Remember that, initially, it's not used to bringing these things to you, rendering toward you what it is you want (obviously not, since you propose these goals as that which you desire and therefore which you in some way lack-at least proportionately). Therefore at first there may not seem to be much response from \"the world at large\". You must accept that patiently, and get past it. At first there may be glimmerings, fits and starts as if some aspect of your object was hoving into view from the Distant Land; atfirst there may be seemingly false beginnings, poor or unpropitious timing resulting in missed cues, failed opportunities and mixup of signals so that the cab leaves the curb just before you get there. You may seem to see the desired giftfloating, just out of reach, on the back of the serpent-sakei, but then some sudden hesitation or gap of guilt will pass over the nature current's countenance and she'll turn aside, carrying the tantalizing package away on her rippling ridges (the Saki is indeed programmed by habitual ego-tendency to feel and respond to such guilt, unwittingly coded into her repertoire along with other assortedmaphazard commands instilled by the developing psyche as it customizes itself \"by crash\" in early family episodes and adolescent angst of the learning process-4or \"guilt\" isn't just a foible by ethnicity; it lurks as a common tendency of the formative .psychological complex commencing with the infant's first intimation that its imperious actions may not be received, may even be thwarted or countermanded- thus bringing to every effort toward change a subliminal doubt and guilty hesitation in the face of modifying what's \"already established\", i.e. the archetypal mossback impression of the parental presence. This tendency is in no way neutralized or repaired until a sufficient degree of conscious wisdom-recognition is brought to bear on it, its disguised elements thoroughly identified and uprooted therewith.) All these apparent counterindications may appear at first, because the Sakti is notyet in the habit. The heart's desire may seem to depend, still, on the all-too-clurnsy apparatus of conscious device, conscious effort, conscious timing which means that it all still seems to hang on the fkil"},{"pageNumber":886,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV structure of strictly personal competency which was of course the identified shortcoming to begin with. But this is just atfirst. As with bikeriding or driving a car, the beginning phases of learning are full of hesitancy, misgiving, doubt, awkwardness, too-muchdependence on methodical imple- mentation by laborious rote so that the very surroundings seem to respond with untimely intrusions, abrupt breaks, close calls and unlucky coincidences. This is the general case atfirst. Of course, for the major part of that human minority ever having assayed this more magnified style of habit-formation, first returns are the ceiling and discourage any further pursuit in assumption that the whole project is misbegotten to begin with. These are those for whom an initial trepidation seems confirmed, so they back away before their \"souls\" are swallowed (or, more to the real point before their remaining investment goes down the drain); or it describes the major part of the major part of mankind for whom there never seems to be a sufficient \"faith in things unseen\". However, if the first hesitant stutter-steps of the Sakfi in receiving unfamiliar instruction (thus tending to interpret it in \"old\" teams) are patiently granted, presently there may be detected a reversal of \"tonality\". With a subtle shift, all which had seemed out of phase slips suavely into phase, and where before the rhythms of timing were b'unf~rtunate\" now they are--by just that magnitude-uncannily in place for optimum positive effect. This tonality-adjustment doesn't display its happy harmonic through improvement in \"personal habituation\" alone; but as much as personal practice inevitably produces finer aptitude in the formal phases of mnemonic exercise, forwarding to the zone of \"second nature\" all the little tricks in \"remembrance\" reinforcing parallel aspirational insistence toward the proposed aim, by that much more does the magnifying process of the nature current multiply the seeds of implication so that the complex pattern of the whole becomes more practiced in swinging its cyclic edges into adjustive congruence with the personal \"profile\" being tailored, by such willed application, to a common-automatic mechanism. The smoother facility of one's mechanical performance, descriptively within the sphere of personal influence, is met and more-than-matched by a corresponding adroitness of coordinative factors in keeping of \"the world at large\" which can in no way be interpreted as under the ordinary governance or conceivable influence of the \"personal\" level at all. With practice, the effect can be quite startling just as if one's habituated facility with the channel-changer-while making one an adeptus, perhaps, of common channel-surfing--in no way anticipates or accounts in ordinary terms for one's sudden ability to pull in n number of consecutive programs split-seconds apart and randomly dispersed over the buttons, in which the word \"never- more\" is just being spoken! only to hear, out the open window, someone down the block shouting the very same--unlikely-word at the precise conclusion of the video sequence. Indeed you may test this effect of transpersonal synchrony on a modest scale firsf before assaying grander goals, so as to get used to the idea and to see how unmistakable the Uncanny can become-virtually calling attention to itself, so that its propitious results can't be ascribed in good faith to \"other\" and ordinary causes. One should practice a kind of game+ether with cards, a \"randomizing\" computer program, passing license-plates while driving--requiring one-part per- sonal input as when dealing a deck but depending for its total outcome on factors consensually considered beyond \"personal\" control (as the number of times equally-skilled players may hit a perfect 2 1). One should apply the battery of visualizing techniques, third eye amplifications, fusion of \"passional\" associations into the abstract intent etc. over a sufficient period of time to be able to measure a high contrast of results fiom beginning stages to later stages."},{"pageNumber":887,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1V Given that one is sufficiently intent in this practice (as folks can become quite passionate over Pac Man, or Super Mario Brothers), and avoids treating it indifferently as just an incidental experiment, it should not take long before statistical correlations well above chance appear, and remain in defiance of the dispersion-around-the-central-tendency rule. Before taking this methodology to the casino or the racetrack or a floating pokergame however, be certain sufficient habituation to practice has been invested in the particular model for which you have interest. Gamblers find to their regret that the Sakti of the nature-current doesn't translate a \"habit\" for influencing horses into a facility for wooing the roulette wheel any better than one can \"convert\" the time spent in learning to swim to an arbitrarily equivalent facility for hockey-playing (unless a certain magical rule is employed--but that's beyond the scope of this essay, and probably beyond the concentrative scope of the majority readership in any case). \"Who\" Wants To Know So! Monty, we hear a certain proportion of the more suspicious readership exhale already, you do too secretly subscribe to some version of \"personal reality creation\" regardless that you may integrate its truth into a larger hmework, or characterize the realization of its effect according to another principle. Again, Monty must insist this is just not the case. Having begun at last to achieve some competency in the effect which goes mistakenly into the new age flubber-model YCYOR, perhaps the (successful) portion of the readership will now be in a position to register the surrounding real conditions, and apply such first-hand observation to a consideration of the perennial wisdom-teach- ing belonging to initiated understanding. Recall we stated earlier that the real mystery-school tradition, while acknowledging and even teaching forms of \"occult efficacy\", insists on bracketing the subject with the question \"W?zo is originating the goals and practicing the achievement of these effects?\" We've given ourselves a head start in answering such a question, in that we've already noted how there's aprimary level of Identity to Being and a secomhy level; and by further noting that the functional point of departure in which goals are formulated and aspired toward occurs at (and is a telltale manifestation of) the secondary level, i.e. the plateau of ordinary egoconsciousness already several steps removed hm meaningful recognition of the prim identification-processes underlying its activity. This is the level necessarily addressed by any question of occult means or metaphysical efficacy in changing circumstances \"closer to the heart's desire\" (i.e. \"creating reality\", in the extravagant phrase). We have also seen that this is the level at which the personalized ego-psychology based upon secondary dichotomizations of sewnot-self is already inplace and activated. Indeed this very ego-psychology is the actor in all cases wherein goal-orientation and efficacious change toward targeted ends is the paramount concern, and serves to comprise the de facto philosophical \"pro- posal\" of the given culture. This whole venue is strictly third-stage in origin, and the fact that it \"slops over\" into 4th stageldensity zones such as that exhibited by the Sassani only indicates the extent to which the order of density-progressions has been displaced, and suffers more or less mutual contaminations. If then, we've achieved most-concrete evidence of our targeted goal in ways miraculous and unmistakably \"magickal\", we ought now to note that we've done so while functioning well within the general formula of standard ego-p~ychology (don't kid yourself, dude--at the most that's all you've really done). This means, of course, that we're still functioning completely under spell"},{"pageNumber":888,"pageContent":"of the unresolved \"puzzle\" epitomized in the problem of the \"first person categorical negative\", or general self-reference paradox. The primmy mode by which everything presents itself as an integral identity-model remains invisible beneath the dace, like crazy-glue, binding at the seams all subsequent \"broken\" edges of the identity-patterns apportioning functional values of sewnot- self. SelfKnots Nought Into Not-Serf Self-got (Help Wanted Ad In Periodical For Doublejointed Stage Prestidigitators And Out-Of-Work Escamateurs) Indeed the very formula implicitly embedded in standard goal-orientation is that of the identificationfpositing of \"not-self\" (that which one is not or has not or does not, to some degree) as potential model of \"self\" (that which one ideally would be or have or do); and reciprocally of the assessment of \"self\" (that which one believes one is or has or does) in terms of what must be inmified or diminished in order to convert the model of not-self into ideal self. Thus under the general roof of goal-orientation, the disturbing \"void\" (in the form of not-self) haunts the premises. The \"otherness\" of existence produces a tacit eversion or turning-in- side-out of the primary identification-process; as is more thoroughly described in Logos/Anti-Logos II, the immediate sparkling qualities disclosing percepWcognitive potentials in the basic \"self- ness\" of being are distanced and proportionately alienated as problematic not-selfat the tips of utilitarian prehensili~. As the reflexive and contractile polarization of the ego-psyche proceeds, the ideal \"self\" projected in descriptive profile presides as the problematic standard-of-being. Since primary whole-being Identity value may never equate in one-to-one manner with descriptive tenus, the Selfhess of Being continuously flows through and over and around and beyond the contingent ego-model so that the latter is constantly slipping away fiom perfect congruence, displaced and continuously projected into the inexistent \"future\" tense (the eternal domain of \"not-quite-yet\"); therefore the idealized ego-self model is continuously permeated with not-self: Not only is it not equivalent to the proportions and dimensions of present identity (which latter is assigned negative value, owing to the perceived lack) so that it is haunted by and descriptively characterized in void-terms as what the self is not; the ideal ego-self model translates those haunting void values into the potential \"not-self' of everything and everyone \"standing in the way\" or theoretically interfering with---coming between4e present empty self and the posited ideal selfpy ontological category, the current not-self). Thus at the secondary level of the identification processes constituting the familiar ego-psychology, \"self\" is saturated and plagued by \"not-self\" at the same time =--and by virtue of the fact that-it projects an idealized \"not-self\" as the model for its \"self\"! Nor does the presiding structure entwining these mutually negating tenses of the original, whole-being identity value, change or shift or dissolve in the least when such goals (descriptively equivalent to the ego-ideal) are tangibly attained. The inexistent \"future tense\" wherein the ideal self-model resides, remains . . the inexistent \"future tense\" wherein the ideal self-model resides; for, although the c-g circumstances certainly change, the presiding abstract structure of the secondary identification- processes doesn 't change. This is the reason why, \"the more things change the more they remain the same\"."},{"pageNumber":889,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV No matter what \"reality\" you \"create\" therefore, you've done so strictly as the function of a governingp~ychic structure in no way effected by the outcome of that \"realitycreation\"-and therefore as problematic after-the-fact as it was before. It does no good to ask whether one might be able to \"create a reality\" which wasn't functioning on such self-contradictory premises, for the whole proposition of \"reality creation\" to begin with is only the eqression of those secondary identification processes. This doesn't mean that the apparently illusory structures of \"temporality\" and \"goal-orientation\" may not be employed in another manner to work a kind of metaphysical \"jujitsu\" upon themselves (Krishnamurtbi and all other such premature sages notwithstanding); we've discussed this possibility before (\"Big Spin\") and shall do so again--the \"secret\" involves a shift fiom egosrientation to what we term true spiritual orientation--but the fact remains that such structures are problematic by definition, in the context of \"personal reality creation\" and all its common relatives. \"Reality creation\", \"positive thinking\", \"being all you can be\" and every other such appeal to optimizing self-and-circumstances operate necessarily as a finction of the secondary identification process. But they take place inevitably within the encompassing hework of the primary identification-process. Though they functionally \"negate\" the primary process, they in no way cancel its underlying presence and presiding, permissive Value. Indeed it's for this very reason the dichotomization \"self/not-self\" can never take place cleanly, but generates a coinherent condition involving the identification-of-opposites so that the grappling terms end up embedded in one-another like bre'r rabbit and the tar baby. What then, we may ask, is the implication for the servo-mechanism of the nature current? which we've identified as the magical agency continuously transcribing the net value of overall thinking-processes into mirroring experiential effect. If the sakri of nature is a habit pattern on the universal as well as personal scale, and if we've found a way to turn such fact to our advantage in rendering what we want, what becomes of theproblematic component which still seems to be present and operative through the very orientation that brought us to this magnified efficacy? Let's return to a definition we gave earlier in this essay (which, at the time, might have been a tad indigestible) and roll it around the mental palate again in light of what's been learned: \"Experience is a functional gauge of the specific proportion in the energy pattem of one's identity-profile, between Whole-being value and the orientational stress of those psychological mechanisms through which one provisionally adapts to the compass of that Value.\" Whole-Void Becomes The Hole-Votum We've seen the way in which the self-reflective psyche rooted in its origination-phase at 3rd density, adapts to the compass of whole-being value; its veryproject as an abstract model, is that of equating itself with whole-being value in representational terms. In alignment with fictional differentials through which it interpretively cognizes the field of potential identity-equa- tions, consciousness forms those standard complexes dear to psychiatry as a secondary pattern of self-adumbrating fypologies, carded by affinity into selfhot-self counters. (\"I ... like oranges, don't like avocado\" ...\" I...want to be a fireman, don't want to be a doctor.\" \"I ... like emotionally-warm people, don't like clinically cold people\"; \"I ... hate my mother's 'weakness', love my father's 'strength' but hate my father's indifference, love my mother's warmth, can't untangle one trait from the other so I fear warmth as weakness and equate strength with coldness so I become an avocado-eating doctor and hate myself...\")"},{"pageNumber":890,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV In this way the unitive factor of whole-being value tends to be emphasized as the orientational centrism sticking-together a variable network of identity models; while the void factor of whole-being value tends to accompany the sifiing-out (and projective negation) of everything identified as negatively-serving actuation of the ideal identity profile. Owing to the innate coinherence of terms unity contrarily accrues to the determined \"otherness\" of being, bornwing against the primary injection of \"self' into the preparatory outline of every cogmzable quality so that \"not-self' subsists as a secondary identification-device without ontological merit; \"otherness\" isn't dispersed by the instmental factor of negation but regroups as an ordered ensemble characterizing whole (variable) zones of the extended field, sitting as a primed \"charge\" of counterpositional potential in the adhesive background of the identity-model. Contrarily, the void factor clings to the postulate of \"self\" in its representative identity- equation, installing the inevitable discrepancy between the abstract ego-model as an empty affirma- tion and the plenum degree (or absolute saturation-density) required to close the gap in the projective self-congruence between aim and object. Thus at the secondary level of the psychological complex, \"self' is haunted by the \"otherness\" of being (both as the generality summing a persistent atmospheric lack; and as the potential specificity of abrasive \"not-self ' personifications serving to embocfy that interruptive void term parting the otherwise-unitive ground into the immediate shore of projectembarkation and the far shore of definitive \"arrival\"). At the same time, the \"otherness\" of being retains the disconcerting unity and coherent \"selhess\" of primary identity-potentials so that the waking Aristotelian boundary-lines established to conserve clarity-ofdefinition inevitably shift, bleed through and participate in peculiar ceremo- nious counterchange at the border of sleep and dreams. In this way \"the psychological mechanisms through which one provisionally adapts to whole-being value\", being by definition representational (in symbolic substitute of a triangulated term for the unitive void-continuity of absolute), generate inevitable degrees of internal stress in the discrimination of umbilically-idenrified facrors. The resultant quotient of \"existential tension\" isn't strictly a product of the simple self-contradiction involved in the tendency toward one-to-one identity equations, having inextrica- ble mirror-negative counterparts for which a comparable dignity-by-identification is refused (if rhis were the case, the \"solution\"-which we've heard from many mystic quarters and esoteric teachings--would indeed be simple courtesy-extension of the value of identified attachment to the mirror obverse \"nor-self\" [\"love thine enemies\" etc.], whose address is easily locatable since it's always in Identity's backyard). Rather, the resulting quotient of \"existential tension\" is derived from the stress-value in selfhot-self ratios determined by the specific degree of identity-equivalence involved, measured againsr rhe standard of Whole-being value. Nor is this a matter of comparing incommensurable terms, since-* we shall see in a later section-Whole-being value while unexpressed and inexpressible in itself nonetheless implies an ideal ratio-of-co~~espondence in the creative field required for implementing a satisfactory Resolution. From this \"f~rmula'~, it's easy to see that the quotient of tension characterizing the ego-psyche in any given case is a direct function of the degree and committed intensity in the identity-investment of whole-being value, with respect to a given (representational) term. The nearer a one-to-one equation is established (i-e. the more purely \"humorless\" the effort to stuff an"},{"pageNumber":891,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV indeterminate Whole into a finite part), the more sharply contrasted with whole-being value in itself; and therefore the greater degree of tension to be found between the coinhering \"parts\" each inferentially committed to an equal if inversely stated whole-being claim. The Graduate Let's look in, then, on the ideal subject having experimentally graduated our course in \"personal reality creation\". Should all advice have been faitbf'ully followed till success was manifest, one's \"reality\" should have been satisfactorily \"created\" in close correspondence to the heart's stated desire. The formulated goal with which the subject began should, ideally, be realized. The broken-hearted should have her loved one, the luckless fisherman should be closing toward port with teeming nets, the local d.j. should be hired on at KTLA as primetime anchor-person, the physician should now be boasting an SRO practice. Yet in each case the triumphant reality-creator is characterizable as precisely the self-hating doctor who eats avocados, having ambivalent parental identification-patterns that break out in uncomfortable dreams of androgyny, of hennaphroditism and sex-change operations in which (the horror! the horror!) he's his own physician! For we've seen that the one who \"creates his own reality\", consciously or unconsciously, through codified intent or the haphazard habit-pattern of the chronic interior monologue, is precisely the one functioning on secondary psychological structures of preferential identity-profiling for whom the reality creator hypothesis is peculiarly appealing in the first place. If you have succeeded experimentally in realizing your heart's desire through the kinds of non-ordinary means outlined here, you are certainly still the self-hating doctor who eats avocados (even if you've realized the goal of becoming the hot-blooded fireman who loves himself, and eats oranges). Just who did you think had achieved the coveted result? Did you somehow become enlightened in the meanwhile, so that the one who meets his object at the end is no longer the one who posited the object as desirable at the beginning? If so, then who is there to receive the marvelously magnetized object in the moment? since the one functioning on anything but the 3rd-stage rooted, secondary identification processes should find no special affinity toward condi- tional resultants other than the spontaneous affinity for conditional existents in general, as expres- sive occasion or instrumental advantage of that whole-being realization. The one for whom the conditional realization of a goal serves or provisionally satisfies an abstract identity-equation, is certainly the one for whom secondary identification-processes in the formation of the psychic complex continue to describe the prevailing functional reality. Then we must ask, did the \"reality creator\" in question \"create his own reality?\" What structure is really in charge here, in all these instances when a goal is formulated and procedural steps are taken to secure that goal? Is not the factor of identity paramount in the determination of the kinds of conditions that will be formulated, and intensified-toward-prevailing? And is not identity the dichotomized value in secondary, psyche-formulating processes for which an absented goal or ideal self-description holds merit owing precisely to the internal contradictions and ambiguous negations actual& descriptive of the currently operative ego-psyche? In this light, it is not the bare lack of material goods or even subsistence quantities etc. that compels the venue to be \"created\"; rather, it is the quality of identity invested in the \"testimony\" of conditional circumstances, that exerts differential valuation over all such occasions thereby determining the types of consequence or characteristic flow of implication issuing from the point-event. 876"},{"pageNumber":892,"pageContent":"This is not at all the same thing as saying that \"meanings are arbitrary\" and that therefore \"you create your reality\" according to the capricious superposition of meanings upon a neutral field. Indeed given our above characterization, it's easy to see how meanings are precisely the resultant in the relationship between whole-being consciousness and the conditionalfield, so that the variable meanings ultimately encoding aims and actions applied toward the field of experience are manifestly expressions of the exact ratio in the investment of whole-being consciousness through identity-equa- tions with that field. Wherein We Slice The Lemon To A Finer Decorative Ganesh For The Manifestival Fruitsalad How may we understand this in concrete terms? Let's go back to our lemon (the very fact that many of the readership involuntary pucker or defensively salivate at the mention of lemon, should indicate reason-enough for our continued usage of this sublimely Jupiterian fruit. LIMVN by Hebrew Qabala is 136; and 136 is the quintessential Jupiterian number, as we learn in \"Motto-In-The-Lotto\" . Note this value was actually edited out of the final \"trimmed-down \"version of \"Motto-in-the-Lotto ': It is sum of the munbers 1-16, and is equal to the term for both the Spirit and the Intelligence of Jupiter). We noted that a form of perfectly objective perception such as lemon exerts at the same time a range ofpsychic response. The comparative \"sourness\" or \"freshness\" of the fiuit prepares an entire symbolic palate which, without laborious self-reflection or piecemeal extrapolation yields unific ideofonn value, ready meaning-typology and a kind of \"transcendental category\" (in that its specific \"sense\" may be interpretively applied to a variety of conditions each wringing its own characteristic nuance or quality from \"lemon\", while the ideotype as a whole binds the diverse situations to a psychic common denominator rendering a uuific class). Thus the exhilarating freshness of a citron-skied morning may immediately suggest the purificatory jubilation of biting through a cold fksh lemon; the sight of a disabled Edsel on the curb may evoke the unmanageable defeatism of the proverbial \"lemon\", in the sense of that \"fruit which is impossible to eat\"; the breakup of a business meeting of the day before, may make its self-symbolizing appearance in dream where our yellow fruit is left in the middle of the abandoned table, symbol of a \"deal gone sour\". In each case the objective form (i-e- the object of identifiable shape, texture, size, taste, odor etc.) functions as variable representation of aquality-of-being. Insofar as any intelligible whole is concerned, the given form is constitutive of the relationship between consciousness and the phenomenological field and is exemplq ofthat relationship, such that it represents a totalpotential of being. It gives the whole-of-being in its self, as a particular representational quality as if to say \"Being is (potentially) of this nature.\" Thus where the object \"lemon\" is concerned, its form conveys to consciousness the psychic correspondence between the whole-being value of the latter, and the phenomenological field as a whole. It gives a variable equarion for consciousness, of a potential range for harmony or inharmony belonging to the inherent nature of symbol. It characterizes that potential range for harmonylinharmony in a particular way, just as \"fire\" so characterbzs an analogous range, and \"water'' etc. The potential symbolically represented by \"lemon\" im't the same as that symbolically represented by a mountainrange, or an ocean wave, yet they equally constitute some psychic"},{"pageNumber":893,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV equation of harmonylinharmony for consciousness (wild or measured power, weakness or gentle- ness, serenity or sternness...).

Doesn't the vastness and immobility of the mountain, either to waking or to dreaming consciousness, often obviously suggest the serene unchangeableness of noumena, the stoic perseverance of reality-es- sence, the power and untouchable majesty of the whole (or the \"greater\") with respect to the diminishiugly fractal forms distributed as so much brush and boulder over its Body?

In every case, what we have are variable equations of symbolically-rendered har- monylinharmony ... each (ideoform) whole of the cognizable field is constituted immediately as a psychic value in the relation between consciousness-absolute and the delimited reaim. 'While each, as such a psychic equation, represents the totality wholly in itself, each as a conditional existent can never substitute for the whole on a one-to-one basis. It's this consideration which brings us to the question as to the way each such phenomenological quality expmses some proportional value of itself, hm the whole-potential of its range, as a contextual factor (i-e. how is it that \"lemon\" may function as apwificatory symbol in one concrete case, and as the epitome of repugnance in another?) A Dreambus With A Full Picture Of Lemonade How does the general value summed in the form \"lemon\" yield its specific symbolic quality as the operator of a real occasion? To understand this, all we need do is refer back a page or two to the observation \"the nearer a one-to-one equation is established (between whole-being identity and a representative term) the more shrapiy contrasted with whole-being value in itself, and therefore the greater degree of tension to be found between the [resultant mirroring] 'parts' each inferentially committed to an equal if inversely stated whole-being claim\". We'll illustrate this rule with the phenomenological quality \"lemon\". We may say that an intense-virtually one-to-one4dentity equivalence staked upon the differential of a given circumstance, compresses the finitude of the term proportional to the ballooning of its psychic \"mass\" (or comparative weight of its emphasis) as wh& one is strongly identiied through the present act of running for the bus enroute to an impatiently waiting lover, or once-in-a-lifetime business deal that won't stay put another twenty minutes. (The more acute and thus delimited the concerned focus, the heavier its gravitational influence on the scales of identity.) The magnitude of displacement for this. term is tacitly measured against whole-being value; the more restricted and totalizing the identity-investment, the more it \"owes\" to whole-being value4w the greater the reactive displacement its pressure engenders. As one rushes for the bus, one incidentally sees a passenger seated toward the open door biting into a lemon: in scenario (a) one just makes the bus before the impatient door wheezes shut. In the deep symbol-economy of the mind, the synchronous sight of passenger-biting-lemon is equivalent to and corresponds succinctly with the rush of exhilaration felt toward the victorious"},{"pageNumber":894,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV footrace. In scenario (b) one just misses the bus as the indifferent door. hemetically seals itself, the rolling glimpse of the passenger-biting-lemon being in this case synchronously expressive of--and equivalent with--the disappointing soumess one feels toward the cruel \"impersonality\" of things. (If these equations don't occur to one consciously in the moment, they may appear more recogniz- ably in the symbol-content of dream. The more vividly the event is illuminated by the character of its psychic charge, the more intensely and overtly do its objects \"speak\".) In either case, the phenomenological property firnctions as the symbol-type of the prevailing identity equation. It gives the ratio of correspondence between whole-beii identity and the governing psychic profile, as a proportion in the meaning-range of a representative fonn. (It's obvious fi-om this that phenomenological qualities may therefore function as expressive types yielding ratios in the equations of the ego-psyche, or equally as expressive adjuncts of awakened whole-being consciotlmess: the \"sun\" may characterize the merciless oppressiveness of things, the sunny fortune of a sudden opportunity-or it may shine in expressive accompaniment as the cognitive counterpart of whole being Presence, not different hm the totality of that Presence yet participating in Its emblematic palette along with everything-and-nothing else.) Study this description over and over again, as it accurately characterizes what any phenomenon actualiy is, how and why existence \"suffers the appearance \"of any phenomenological expression, and how the entire conditionalfield is a function of identity in such a way that ' jpersonal reality creation\" is etedly recognizable as a gross misnomer for the continuous process of forming reality-models against the seIf-adjwtive, Whole-being Standard of Reality. Turning The Lemon Inside-Out- The Everyday Legerdemain Of Mind The provisional \"denouementw--one way or another-f a situation with which one tends to be identified, doesn't exhaust the psychic potential through which the situation acquired its meaning and charge. The elements of the situation may be resolved or dispersed; but the psychic"},{"pageNumber":895,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV structure of identityequations through which it was organized as meaning-content, has not been changed. Indeed since all such meanings depend upon, reflect and reveal that psychic structure to itself through real occasions, they only serve in themselves to reinforce that structure regardless the given \"outcome\". Thus in the case of our bus-chaser* the psychic potential inhering abstractly in lemon isn't exhausted through discbarge across the \"synapses\" of a particular configuration; the persist- ence of the secondary psychic structure! (of ego-identification patterns) resurrects the whole potential in the combustive ashes of the moment: in case (a) the exhilarating circumstance of having barely caught the bus harbors the worm of ambiguity within itself immediately; there's still the chance that the lover or awaiting businessmen might be missed, or the \"deal\" in either instance fall through. The abstract ego-model, haunted by an inbuilt lack in the discrepancy between its \"mandatory\" specificity (i.e. finitude) and the indeterminate value of whole-being identity against which it borrows for its infinitely-dcient Standard, interprets such lack through definitional emptiness of the tenses: the \"no longerY'/\"not yet\" of past-and-future, on the horizontal cross-beam of which the Vertical self-reflector is chronically crucified. Thus the inverse psychic potential contained phenomenologically in \"lemon\" (as well as every other intelligible whole or ideoform quality) remains abstractly suspended in the identity- atmosphere; all mirror-values of the phenomenological field hover about, springloaded through the persistent tension in the unresolved psychic complex. In case (b), the definitive statement of \"soumess\" covering a universe in that determinative moment, can hold its \"absolute\" rule no better than its more favorable counterpart; the essential void-being through which the psychic structure is elaborated, steals away the victory fiom every symbolic claim-to-being. Immediately the converse potential of \"refi-eshing jubilation\" insinuates its shadowy continuity as a reviving possibility: one can still hail a cab, grab a bicycle or steal a car depending on the preemptive character of the identity-equation. The ratio in the proportional expression of meaning-range for the psychic value of any given quality, is constitutionally unstable as a function of the identity-construct; it is in continuous flux owing to the fact that its \"parts\" are coinhering aspects of a whole, so that the specific (symbolic) identity-value assigned a highlight phase in that ratio is inferentially identr9ed with, and charged by an equivalency to, the tem it serves to negate by contextual emphasis. Thus the ~ymbolic character of the (psychically surcharged) phenomenological field, exhibits the same quality as the self-referring statement; such behavioral identity demonstrates a real equivalency. We may return to our initial observations regarding the ideoform character of the phenomenological field. All cognitions and perceptions at the primary level are immediate, abstractly-unific intelligibilities through all contributoryfeal~res; each such apprehension borrows its coherence and abstract unity against the indeterminate \"selfhess\" of the consciousness it reflexively represents. Each such intelligible whole announces its unific presence as provisional relief, in negation of the potential coherencies through which it is conditionally-existent (i.e. the identity \"book\" is made as sacrificial negation of the contributory properties possessing equal unific coherence in potential--the paper, the marks of ink forming identifiable letters, the grainy material of the cover, the green desk blotter against which the book is hed, the odor of mahogany specifically contributing to the atmosphere in which \"book\" is apprehended...). Thus all such unific identities are, as a function of cognition, mutually inverse identities."},{"pageNumber":896,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The primary \"selfiess\" of the intelligible whole (\"book\") as a function of cognition borrowing against the indeterminate identity of consciousness, and the essential negation through which that determinable whole is drawn into identiiied relief, ally all forms of perceptionkognition and every phenomenological quality unimpeachably to the self-referring statement (i.e. the \"first person categorical negative\"). And the whole paradox of the \"first-person categorical negative\", as we've seen, derives from the initial (complementary) postulates of being, one stated fkom the point-of-view of Absolute and the other stated fkom the conditional point of view: \"perfect seIf-congruence and infinite continuity even under all conditions\" and \"perfect self-congruence and infinite continuity in finite tams.\" If we are to understand the problem embedded in every project of identity, whether aed in terms of \"reality creating\" or simply as a mundane statement of goal orientation, we must come inevitably back to the self-reference paradox and thus to the very question of identity itself: We are reminded of the earlier observation re the Mystery Traditions' perennial insistence on hmhg all questions of siddhi, occult or super-normal efficacy in the overriding context of the primary question-of-being: \"Who Am I\"? and thus who stands in creative relation to what reality?

By how much do the \"Sassani\" and the \"Pleiadesi~ls\" et al. qualie as teachers to this bumpkin-backwater planet, and by how much are they dragging along behind them certain unresolved presumptions of their own, such that (we may display the bad sportsmanship of pointing out) each separate source confesses in its own way how it proceeds hence to c'teach'y from a very problematic background of its own?

Across The Dream Divide: Reflections In A Godin Pond Returning to the question of the saki or power of the nature-pattern, we may now understand just \"what becomes of theproblematic component which still seems to be present and operative through the very orientation that brought us to this magnified efficacy\". As accomplished \"reality creators\", we shall have materialized our heart's goal(s) focused and enforced according to the previous instruction, so that---technically spealung-everythmg essential to the operative definition of the ego-ideal should be set in place. We have what we want. The proportions in the symbol values of all psychic qualities have correspondingly shifted (the birds are chirping out the window, a smogless azure sky smiles down over the city, a gentle breeze caresses satisfied wildflowers in a porcelain vase of fulfillment, the lemon-yellow wallpaper of the room appears intensely a-peeling ...) While circumstances have changed, and a correlated relabeling in the (self-symbolizing) ratios of all psychic phenomenology has been registered, the basic psychic stnrcture through which the drive was conducted has-* we've seen-not changed; rather it is always reinforced by its own correspondences. In proportion as one side of this self-reference gestalt is intensified, the obverse or m-r-negative is comspondingly magnified in its own domain. The reason that this is so, remember, has to do with the relation of the identity pattern to the whole-being value against which it borrows. This means that the Balance of whole-being equilibrium (identity as inznite continuity, which homogenizes to equipotential uniformity) is brought as the fruing standard against every ratio in the proportional distribution of polarized identity-values on the finite scale. In the change of ratios to the side offirlfillment (in tern of finitizing identity-patterns) the \"positive length\" stretches while the negative length proportionately shrinks. These respective lengths are created by proportional identity-investment in the first place, however, so that tilting the scales in favor of the \"positive\" phase in this sense only generates the counter-value of an equivalent negative phase against the unqualified Standard of Whole-being identity. (Remember, attachment of identity to a delimited model in the effort to achieve \"infinite self-congruence in linite terms\" is the mechanism that sets in motion this comparative measurement, and it is authorized by phraseology of the Limiting hypothesis itself.) Therefore we're obliged to recognize that the prevailing success ratio framing the \"waking\" status of the identity model doesn't exist in itself, in its own right--it's precisely here that the reality creator's thesis goes out the window forever (cf. \"Big Spin\"). That prevailing dayZight success ratio is reflected across the \"equilibrium trajectory\" or \"special limit set\" of the asymptotes differentially mirroring the waking state and the dreaming state toward one another, in unclosing cross-reference.

Thus the most successful \"reality creator\" imaginable is haunted by contrary dream-im- ageries that can't be shaken. In the reality creator's fknework, there's no reason for their frrrther existence; they should have no independent life. The \"Freudian dustbin\" is superfluous; yet it demonstrably persists. The conventional argument would plead a special case, i.e. that the dutW reality creator hadn't yet rid himself of those unenlightened vestiges of doubt, guilt, fear and co. on which the negative dream-potentials continue to feed. However' in any given instance this is not-necessarily--the case (to a significant degree); rather, it is the continued unrematked existence of thepressure of identity-investment itseIf, which provokes a compensatory countercharge against the whole-being standard. Thus sewnot-self continue to move around inside one another' ambigu- ously participating in one another's reality without respite. Noting that, with every fonn of identified attachment there is a proportional displacement of (mirror-obverse) ratios in the dreamdomain, it's now necessary to evaluate the content of that resultant dream material-not by some 3ungian identification of archetypes, which is true enough on its plane, or by Freudian recognition of repressed contents and verboten wish-fulfillments which also has merit in its own workshop, but with reference to the general measure such dreamcontent makes relative to the degree or intensity-value of identification on the \"daylight\" side. More Reflections In A Godroon Pond Understanding dream-content in general to be just such a reflection of the-varying- ontological \"pressure\" generated through investment of whole-being value (Identity-ofkollscious- ness) in a delimited term, we may expect that content to mirror aproportional exaggeration; for, weighed against the dorm whole-being standard, any style of limiting or limited identification constitutes a highlight \"exaggeration\" of the representative term. A compensatory exaggeration in symbolic language would tend to present a distortive countenance, one disconcerting to--and taking startling liberties with--the preferential egocountenance; it's for this reason dream-content is so often given to mocking or self-parodic imagery, expressly nonsensical typologies making hash of daylight \"sense\", and in general is classified as \"surreal\". Without resort to psychiatrically"},{"pageNumber":899,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV recalled-or fancifuily reconstructed-incidents in the early formation of parental identification pattern (which may have anecdotal value, or convey marginal help by a kind of rough parallelism) we may acknowledge the classic presence of self-destructive, anarchic or adversarial imageries in the dream-content of the most \"successful\" of subjects, as proportional redress of the operative degree of tension in the pressurized identity-equation. We may swiftly read the implication; regardless the degree of \"goal\" success, technical ftlfillment of the abstract ego-ideal or realization of valued aim (or because of it), the subject continues to incarnate sheer existential uneasiness; for the \"project\" which merited his concern to begin with, is always symptomatic representation of the unresolved complex woven of entwined sewnot-self operators. That complex remains, and continues to dominate behaviors, beliefs, drives and desires regardless the technical realization of symptomatic \"goals\". The \"reality creator\" is nothing special, just a case in point. Upbraiding Our Entwined Reflections In A Godel Pond Because the sifted dream-content with its often ferocious fonns and discomfiting, contrary countenances has been recognized in various of history's occult/spiritual traditions as just such a compensatory \"adjustor\", that content has often been actively sought as oracular counsel- as if its divining pool were the appropriate medium for recovering nature's nocturnally-manufac- tured remedies, good against daytime's woes and debilitating identity-investments. Such dream-antigens, however, have a reputation for proving ... tricky. It's generally supposed that the \"treacherous\" element enters in through dream's inherent ambiguity; but this isn't really the case (a sufficiently-astute Oracle or practiced Pythoness can negotiate through the ambiguity so as to accurately assess its \"message\"). The trick clause has to do with the fact that the ordinary dream imagery is generated against the initiating disturbance of daylight identity-invest- ment to begin with. Therefore, if dream's compensatorily exaggerating imageries are taken literally as advice for antidote, we're likely to find shamanic personifications of demons, bbremedial\" practices of ritual mutilation or prescriptions for stringent self-denial in some fom. Indeed this is the direct or indirect source of most religious and (traditional) spiritual practices having to do with extreme austerities, penance, ceremonial dramatizations of repugnant \"passions\" and hellish \"morality\" plays etc. The basis for many body-negative yogas may be located here as well; for the \"waking\" dreamscape imageries of the Astral medium are equally charged with mimr-obverse counterparts of the daytime psyche, so that the balancing \"antidotal\" forms presented there are hardly impartial but take their features fiom influence of every positively-valued item of the conscious identity pattern. The technically \"compensatory\" factor dwells amidst the matter of dream, just as \"fire\" technically compensates \"water\" though you wouldn't want to boil away your bath just to drain your tub---but the symptomatology of guilt dwells there with it, and inevitably comprises a part of its equation since all such counterbalancing imageries are only products and rejections of the unresolved (secondary) processes of problematic identity-formation. Once and for all: the power of Resolution does not dwell with the subconscious or unconscious. All the \"subconscious\" can do is manufacture fonns of technical compensation which you would no more necessarily want to consult and literally implement than you would want to blow up your house to rid it of mice--though that would technically compensate the \"mouse\" problem well enough. 884"},{"pageNumber":900,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV If the-shiftiug-compensatory balances between consciousness and subcon- sciousness furnish us the image of mirroring bars divided into mutualty offsetting ratios between sewnot-self, why may we not recognize the image of equilibrium in a single bar simply divided in half: 50150 gives us a neutralizing balance in which the squaring-dance of sewnot- self settles into suave self-cancellation, and the drive of \"dilemma\" slows to a halt. This is, after all, what the yogic traditions recognize as the indispensablesattvic quality. What matters, then, that this bar be \"mirrored\" in the dream-domain? They (the bars) remain simple equivalents. Inferentially, what becomes of the distinction between \"conscious\" and \"subcon- scious\"? As we shall see in part IV of this essay, the polarized currents through which the ideotypes of the identity-processes are patterned (thoughts, perceptions, feelings, cognitions) may achieve the likeness of such a balance only in a special way; this is due to the fact that the respective currents do not have equivalent charges in their functions through the mind-body system. This implies the requirement of a specific ratio between the currents in order to achieve the model Balance of our ideally-divided bar. The Sakti Of Our \"Homesick Blues\": Subterranean Tunneling Toward Our Surface Self-reference Residence In the meanwhile, though, we may follow up our question regarding the behavior of the manifesting Saki ofthe nature-current on the basis of what we've learned about the \"subconscious\". We may have recognized already the actual origin of those---50metimes distressing-events which enter our experiential domain as if unbidden, in the above observation that the subconscious forms belonging to dream-life establish a technical compensation relative to daylight identification patterns, without in any way amounting to aresolution of the inbuilt tension of those patterns. Indeed those subconscious fonns only mirror the degree of tension embedded in the springload complex of the ego-psyche. If, then, as all good reality-creators have if the thoughts and intents which you hold in consciousness comprise the patterns of your ultimate experience, it's necessary to recognize the totality of what's implied in any given thought as afimction of the identity-profile, i.e. as an operator of whole being identity-investment committed to a finite term. Now look again at our formula: \"Experience is a functional gauge of the specific proportion in the energy pattern of one's identity-profile, between Whole-being value and the orientational stress of those psychological mechanisms through which one provisionally adapts to that Value.\" This asserts there's a virtual psychic pressure generated, in one-to-one identity equations with terms formulated in thefirst place as symptomatic expressions of the self-negative psychic complex (i.e. the self-reference paradox knotted by \"parental\" identification patterns into an irresolute ratio of sewnot-self operators). The magnirude of the resultant pressure, is a gauge of the comparative weight of identified emphasis (generating a proportiona1,finitizing compression of the selected term) against the implicit referent of whole-being value. The greater the functional pressure, the higher the intensity-value permitted the compensatory factor (formulated with respect to whole-being value). This accounts in general for the \"explosive\" kind of experience suffered by our Central Park jogger; the experience remains the expression of apJychic equation4erefore it continues in"},{"pageNumber":901,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1V some fundamental way to reflect the basic identity pattem, in this thesis as well. \"Experience\" in the Southern Crown teaching is no more the result of \"happenstance\" or \"accident\" than it is for the dutiful reality creator; yet unlike the reality creator we don't have to suffer the fatuous implication that a given subject experiences disaster owing to her active wish or desire for same, her \"hidden shameful\" lust after the calamitously verboten etc. The obedient Sakri of the nature-pattern transcribes the compensatory forms of the dream imagery, as the unenlightened equivalent of wholesome Resolution. Just as ''the dream\" gives the technically compensatory form without resolving any- thing, so the thorough nature-current (based on the prototype circle, remember) knits together both daylight and nocturnal parts of the coinhering \"charges\" belonging to the symptomatic identity- pattern. In this way it obligingly serves the habit of your continued intention, thus bringing you genie-like whatever you will by consistency and unremitting parallelism of direction; at the same time it doesn't fail, in its thoroughness, to serve the balancing factor as measured against a constant Whole-being Standard, necessarily brought forward in lieu of enlightening Resolution as an exaggerated swelling fkom the side of the dreamdomain to offset the pressurized disproportion of your daylight identity-investment Let's evoke once again a passage from Part I: \"The specific quotient of pressure (describing the psyche's unique adaptation to the gauge standard of whole-being consciousness) gives the differential that accounts for the resultant discrepancy in experience between people doing apparently the 'same things'. The more acutely the encompassing holismsf-being is denied or repressed (in fear of its commanding subsumption of all identified parts) the more pressure its continued unresolved Presence exerts, the more truly dysfunctional the strategies of psychological adaptation. Experience corresponds much more to that quotient than to any particular thought-con- tent, which may or may not reflect that value.\" Therefore the real point to the relationship between consciousness and experience rotates inevitably back around again to the central question of the Self-reference paradox. It oscillates unerringly toward its own \"state attractor\" comprising the primary term of reality, rather than to the secondary and symptomatic products of that basic Enigma. Now we may identi@ both this classic paradox of the logic embedded in self-reflection (i.e. conscious self-reference) and the transformation behaviors of all systems fkom pranas to giraffes, as belonging equally to the polar forms taken by the primary Proposition of Beiq-which may be stated, depending on whether we \"quote\" fkom the pointsf-view of consciousness-absolute or from the position of the prototypal point-limit, as respectively \"infinite self-congruence and homogenous self-consistency even under all conditions\", or \"infinite self-congruence and homoge- nous self-consistency infinite terms\". Such variations of expression seem opposed, and therefore irreconcilable on the surface. We may ask, is there a place where these expressions meet, so that their \"opposition\" is only seemingly so? Is there a juncture of mutuality where in fact they're resolved as varying expressions of a unitive Idea? Before addressing the \"self-reference\" paradox as such, it would be helpful to examine these noetic roots of the general self-reference theme. In this way we establish a firm foundation in understanding such questions as \"whose Reality is it?\" \"of what does the 'creation' consist?\" \"what is 'determined'? what is 'fi-ee'?\" \"what is the real latitude of fkeedom?\" and \"Who's on first?\""},{"pageNumber":902,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV In Tolerantly Totaling The Toll In The Whole Toleration Of Limit First, then, is there a \"place\" where the primary expressions of Being (that which is issued by Limitlessness, and that propounded by Its authorized Limit) indeed meet so that their \"opposition\" is only seemingly so? If there is such a place, the Greater would certainly seem obliged to accommodate the lesser. Since \"limit\" is the dependent prototype of Absolute, it would appear overbearing to expect such qualification to meet its Maker on Its own unqualified ground. (However, just such expectation has been proposed, in one form or another, through various of the historical traditions both religious and philosophical.) In fact we find it's the insistence of limit that it enjoy \"absolute continuity and infinite selfcongruence on its own delimited ground\" which furnishes the resolving term--and necessarily so, since it couldn't be expected of limit that it surpass its inherent qualification toward that which, by definition, it could never be in-itself; while the constitutional dependency of limit on Absolute shows a derivative correspondence which does not similarly debar the Latter fiom llfilling the term of the former as an expressive adjunct of Absolute (such an adjunct has been referred to descriptively as \"bangles\" in the Hindu tradition, \"ornament\" in Hebrew etc.). Owing to the eternal allowance bestowed on limit (Akash) by the all-permissiveness of Absolute (consciousness), the Latter may not enter straightway into--dnd therefore violate the chaste integrity sanctified to-the former so as simply to negate its restrictive non-accommodation directly. Obligingly accommodative as Absolute (all-potential) necessarily is, by that much does the prototype of its creative potential necessarily invert or negatively-reverse that value as the test of Absolute-all-accommodation, precisely in the form of restriction and the non-accommodation of contractile limit. Therefore, though techni'cally Absolute-like \"the lizard kingW-can \"do anything\" and may directly disperse the term of limit as much as do ought Else in the halls of its own Infinity, since its all-permissive void being precisely grants the test-hypothesis of Limit as creative prototype of limitless potential it would hardly be sporting of Absolute to call the challenge off by simple forced entry, expansive habitation (infinitely greater than the capacity of limit to bear) and thus by -what would amount to--an instantaneous dispersal. For one thing, Absolute's all-potential would eternally suffer the ghost of \"denied\" Limit haunting the commodious Premises! Finitude would come back and back like Hamlet Senior, seeking justice on its own behalf. Indeed at Infnity (Absolute's very own venue) it would have to be granted the dignity of its own premise. We may note in passing that, in the creative process generated through Limit with respect to the Absolute from which it derives, the potential of just such a peremptory violation of the one by the Other (so as to homogenize the upstart term of limit into a dissolving mist receding to a recumbent Mnity enjoying Its dreamless sleep) is necessarily given its spurs as well; just such a \"reflective light\" of Absolute, generated on the basis of Limit's restrictive presence (and therefore obliged by that term) comes to prosecute the hypothesis of Negative-being as a negation of the premise of Limit. It becomes a hypostasis in the presence of creative limit, precisely that hypostasis driving the proposition which glirnmeringly \"occurs\" to Absolute on the brink of Its accommodative manifestation, as to the greater Efficiency involved in busting-up the very basis of Limit \"at the start\" so as not to suffer its antinomial insolence. Since \"creation\" gets rolling ahead of the premise (as a refIective light or hypostatic"},{"pageNumber":903,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV postulate of Absolute, such a premise necessarily occurs afier the fact and has some major part of \"limit\" in its constitution), the effort to intercept and cancel Limit \"at the beginning\" becomes in practice the will to interrupt the creative pattern at any point in its progress rather than allow it the grace of its implicationsfiee of such mirror-resi-ce as is extended by the Contrary Light This Contrary Light, a kind of bastard byproduct of Absolute-and-relative born of the first \"collision\" between their \"contrary\" values may justifiably be termed reactive; it comprises a kind of subliminal reflex of Absolute (infinite consciousness) just as It emerges from the dreamless sleep of uninterrupted Homogeneity to the dreaming-potential of interruptive Limit. It bears a strong resemblance to one's first, dawning impulse to assassinate the alarm clock hammering bells inside the morning brain. Carrying considerable \"charge\", such a reflex Light (emanated fiom a subliminal sub-state of Absolute necessarily deriving its conditional character through the interruptive presence of Limit already floating on the dreambed of All-potential) extends its continuity by borrowing against the infmite homogeneity and self-congruence of Absolute, as do all other existents4nly the premise it wishes to thus \"absolutize\" by achieving an infinite consistency-of-being involves the removal of Limit, unqualified termination of the tern of Restriction itself. This Light is called Reversal in the Lurianic Qabala (see inset, Decocting The Qabala Of The Ari) and is said to ascend immediately toward Absolute in a Straightline upon Striking the stage of Restriction in the Desire-to-Receive. Because it is called Straightlight, it is identified as belonging to the side of consciousness and will. Because it reflects backward and \"ascends\" immediately toward Absolute it is clearly distinguished fiom the reflective Light of Straightline known as Ruach, or Spirit, which also strikes the limit of resistance in the 4th stage of Receival but which is induced thereby to a-lign an ideoform pattern by reflex angulation and reverberative mirror-regress known thereafter as Curtain, and comprising a Return to Absolute by the indirect- therefore accommodative--route of Emanation belonging to the patterning circuit or Circle-dance of Logoic Creation. Such reflective and circuitous emanation thereby incorporates (and so honors) the term of Limit as the conditional pattern-of-being, drawing forward and expressing the implications of created limit toward the Ideal of Divine Resolution summing the Logoic Order and purpose. Such Logoic Order at the heart of the Circle or circuit, in fact apotheosizes that Means of reconciling the \"respective\" premises belonging to Absolute and relative alluded to above, when it was suggested the enabling factor was to be found in the insistence of Limit rather than the assertion of Absolute: i.e., \"infinite consistency and homogenous self-continuity in conditional terms. \" The \"finitking\" Order of the Logoic pattern gives precisely the class of measured and exacting conditions whereby the resolving ecstasis between finitude and infinity may be modeled.

This first of all confers a legitimate metaphysical function upon \"time\" rather than dismissing it (in the manner of many \"gyanas\" from Zen to Krishnamurthi-ism) as an inferentially-inexplicable delusion to be dispelled, rather than an operator to be employed through the truly more harmonious form of alliance. (The idea of \"time\" as an acceptable ally is treated more extensively in \"The Big Spin7' essay, part I1 of \"Motto In The Lotto\".) Secondly, it serves to show that in the Zoroastrian viewpoint the Negative principle is not on equal footing with the Positive or holistic principle \"from the beginning\", since Ormudz (Mazda) clearly sets the terms for battle as well as for the field of Resolution. Ahriman's allotted \"time\" doesn't coexist at infinity with the Being of Ahura Mazda; the ground of contention (and thus the contextual framework wherein Abriman may advance the negative viewpoint) is finitized, and hudz is clearly shown to be the Authorizer of such a term. From this spring two more mighty implications, to further our reassessment of the underpinnings of \"Western philosophical dualism\": in denominating a finite term of resolution, Ahura Mazda (or the goodlcreative principle) decisively regulates the mechanism of that \"stereop- tic\" focus wherein bifurcated perspectives are adjusted, drawn together and their angles aligned toward the limit-point in the resolving ratio of balance disclosing how the lesser principle (Ahrimanic denial) can only reflect the proportionally-unitive relation of the greater (Ormudz affirmation) in devotional correspondence with the Whole (Shervan) ... Both Principals in the equation to be resolved, hudz afE.nnation and Ahrimanic denial, are coinvolved in the chief factor of negation distinguishing the creative potential of limit (arguing its validity in the face of Limitlessness); thus each of the Principals ends up as the variable proportion in a ratio determining the correspondence of each ontological \"proposition\"4dress- ing the dilemma of finitude's internal negation of infinitude with respect to the unqualified whole. Of these respective proportions \"Love\" and \"the positive\" are equated, and termed \"greater\" in acknowledgment of the innate residency of the creative limit-proposition through the lovingly permissive amplitude of infinity. The Greater, incorporating the potential of (finite) \"negation\" through the loving all-permissiveness of absolute, configures the unitive continuity of consciousness around the finitizing factor (the Mother, Akash) as a qualged expression of creativiry. Thus it is necessarily given as aproportion in an overall, determining ratio rather than as the unconditional Whole (the all-potential Value of which it positively represents and \"champions\"). It is reflected in the lesser and a posteriori (Ahrimanic) proposition of \"cancelling the negation\", an internal contradiction which is allowed the limit of its expression in supportive augmentation of the Greater or Love-value which grants it as an instance of the limiting term itseIf4ough the lesser (Ahrirnanic denial) takes its motivational drive from the Influence of infinity. In this case the infinitelunitive continuity of consciousness is configured around the finitizing factor in the form of a reactive qualification, coiling about the \"negation\" of limit like a snake as if protecting infinite's integrity at the expense of infinite's all-permissive potential. Since this is employment of the function of Negation \"on behalf' of the Whole against its own delimiting term, it comprises an internal contradiction. It is essentially anti-creative, but necessarily incorporates the value of negation belonging to creativity in order to overthrow it. Thus, such a reactive configuration of conscious abundance negating or denying the umbilical connection"},{"pageNumber":906,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV to (integrally-permitted) finitude is conceived as unlove, steals from that very term for its charac- teristic mode, originates nothing of itself, humorlessly prosecutes an internal contradiction with regard to its own reality and so is called \"lesser\", constituting a variable proportion in the overall ratio giving the comparative and inclusive correspondence with whole-being value. A Phrlosophic Geneology On The Genial Lallations Of Logos/Anti-Logos, Treating How The Lion Shall Rondelet With The Lambdacism (This Concerning The Laterally Lallate Ellipse Of Frater Perdurabo) If the greater proportion is the Mazda-like, positivdactive expression of Absolute abundance in the form of creativity, it is the \"creator\" value of consciousness and corresponds to Logos. If the lesser proportion is the Ahrimanic-like, negativelactive expression of Absolute abundance (in the form of a contrary commandeering of the interior negation-part supportive of creative conditionality) it is the Nilistic contraction within consciousness pulling away, in denial, against the creation and corresponds to Anti-logos. Rather than being dualistically oppositional terms in the strict sense of discrete values, they coinhere, have interdependent originations and thus jointly participate in a conditionality-of- being giving them as proportions in an overall ratio of correspondence. Whereas the Greater (Mazda) proportion positively represents the Whole in affirmation of Its all-potential (permitting internal \"negation\" by the finite) the lesser cannot represent the Whole in equal measure since it proposes to negate the tm of that eternal potential. Thus the Greater pennits and accounts for even the existence of the Lesser, in a way which the Lesser can never similarly permit nor account for the existence of the Greater (since the greater represents the Whole positively and directly as Its internally consistent expression, while the lesser represents the Whole negatively as Its proposed modifier and complete substitute). Thus the Greater proportion known as Logos doesn't stand in total opposition to the Lesser known as Anti-logos but rather accounts for it, includes it as a covariant proportion in that ultimate Equation with the Whole which the Greater positively assays, and values the \"contribution\" of the Lesser in a way which the Lesser, known as Anti-Logos, simply can't reciprocate. The intent of Anti-Logos is always, at least surreptitiously, to cancel out the creative incorporation of (finite) negation by consciousness, while the will of Logos is always that of finding a means of integrating and thus redeeming the \"contribution\" of Anti-Logos. Anti-logos is in opposition; but Logos accounts for, and takes into account, Anti-Logos. The delicate relations of these proportions are entwined through the creation. They've been identified as \"the life-instinct\" and the \"death-instinct\" (for example, in the biological economy they may be recognized as the proportional balance of parasympathetic and sympathetic systems, the relations of aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms etc. such that, when properly coordi- nated the greater of the pairs, for example the parasympathetic system, is able to optimize its organization of the immunology function-yet when the balance tips disproportionately to the side of sympathetic-system function the aggravated emphasis on protracted anaerobic metabolism encourages the corresponding elements to cancel out or tear down the \"dysfunctional\" Whole, rendering it progressively immunosuppressive and disabled to the point of extinction. In a \"perfect world\", the response to stress or imbalance wouldn't produce conditions in which the \"solution\""},{"pageNumber":907,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV to imbalance was to destroy the mechanism of balances completely; but Thanatos has found a way, in this creation, to be included while functioning in its unbridled state as a strict antagonist to the whole. (The sympathetic or fight-flight system is engaged for \"combative\" situations, while the parasympathetic is the sedative part essential for digestive processes, optimum immune efficiency and chief in proportional emphasis when integrating through the consciousness-system.) The Whole ultimately allows the resolving, equilibrative \"say\" to reside with the positive; proportional emphasis is placed upon \"the greater\" in order to adjust the relationships in an equation of--suitably collapsing-equivalencies with Unity, just as Phi is the only geometric proportion in which a three term ratio reduces to Unity: a:b:c=a:b:(a+b). How Ahura Won The Scrimmage By Calling Time This is an important point to understand: it may be objected that we've rung in a superficial term to \"prove our case\", i.e. the renowned Golden Proportion, since Mazdaism by itself seems not to make such reference in its appointment of \"time\" as the limit-set in the field of resolution. (For more of time, light etc. as limit-set in the field of resolution see \"What Is Physics?') However, the very assignation of \"time\" as the venue of such resolution between apparently dichotomized terms requires us to recognize this ultimate denouement as aproportion; proportional assessment must confer a superior relationship of correspondence between the \"greater\" value and unity, since the ascription of objectively equal weight to the terms inferentially seals the triumph of the \"lesser\" (or negative) principle so that it succeeds in having \"its way\": an equalizing apportionment (direct 50150 assay) cancels the tern to zero while implicitly endorsing the value of Negation against the prolific creativity (and innate validity) of manifestation since the directly-equivalent terms stalemate one another: their direct equivalency produces a static zeroing or inert equilibrium definitively silencing the mechanism of ratio, which alone secures the contrasts indicative of creative appearance. But this cancels the term of finity as well; the \"triumph\" of Ahriman would thus implicitly be guaranteed, for a 50150 apportionment banishes the projected finite ground of resolution in an annihilative e&g of oppositional values at Infinity. Thus the negative proposition of Ahriman would succeed in coexisting at infinity with that of Ormudz, the creation would be stilled in accordance with the ant@athetic value expressed through Ahriman so that, by inference, Ahriman wins wherever He can be placed upon equal footing. All Ahriman needs is equal footing, not superior status, to iriumph over Ormudz the Good principle; for such \"equal footing\" is indeed dualism, as the conventional accusation against Mazdaism has it. \"Equal footing\" succeeds in cancelling the creation upon an Infinite (and therefore unresolvable) ground, where positive and negative indeed float in Eternal indistinguishable equivalency. Yet the express stipulation of Zoroastrianism is that the battle of the principles be given afinite limit in which to resolve itself. Its venue of resolution is therefore the field of time; this ensures that the creative Term of Limit, and therefore the innate \"validity\" of finitude, will not be violated in the process; if the term of creative limit is conserved. Ahriman's \"solution\" (annihilative cancelling and lapse to indistinguishable infinity) can't be honored and has no ultimate justification. At the same time, conservation of finitude requires expression of the Resolution of \"contending\" principles as some ratio in the balance of charges, as we've seen. This means however that the Zoroastrian stipulation re afinite time for the accomplishment of Resolution infers and requires the apotheosis of a proportion, some ideal geometric harmony for the optimizing of a Mean."},{"pageNumber":908,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Such \"Mean\" is of course given in the Golden Proportion. Thus we're perfectly justified in our insistence that the Mazdaian stipulation of \"time\" or finite limit as the venue of Resolution declares Onnudz S authorify and proprietorship of the controlling termjPom the beginning. Historical commentators have not undeistood the principles involved, have wholly and chronically overlooked the key (of what today carries over as the Parsi religion) in the apparently negligible cosmogonic \"anecdote\" re the stipulation offinite limit or \"time\" as the ground of Resolution. Zoroustrianism is not a dualism. (The Manichean \"heresy\" which followed upon and borrowed against Zoroastrianism may be considered a philosophical dualism if only by default, in that it doesn't include so subtle a pronouncement on the ultimate metaphysical weight distributed amongst the respective principles.) The insistence upon the finte term in Zoroastrianism not only demonstrates sufficient honoring of the innate validity belonging to the principle of limit (so as to secure the relationship of Love between consciousness-absolute and the creative field, conserving the sacred legitimacy of the latter); such honoring of the \"finite\" auromaticalZy ensures against the ultimate anti-creative or negative victory of Ahriman, which is the postulate of \"infinite equal footing\" or \"eternal dualism\" mistakenly attributed to Zoroamianism as a whole, since any finite resolution of the contending terms requires a ratio in the distribution of weight to their respective values both in order to conserve the term of \"limit\" and to resolve the elements to unify (rather than to the eternally-irresolute stalemate of an annihi1ative-m merely dispersive--exxing of principles without hope of coherent integration). It Isn't So Much Matter That Matters, As The Matter You Put Your Mind To Thus we arrive at our next great implication, namely that the creative tenn of limit or manifestable finitude-although correctly identified as the basis of materiality etc.--is not itserrhe culprit! It is not in itself the negative principle, as it has so often been misidentified (and is still today, even in esoteric philosophies otherwise holding some charm and not a little merit, as that of \"theosophy\" which despite the excellence of the Bailey materials still points to \"matter\" as chief villain in the cosmic scenario--thereby conforming to the Manichean deviation, with neither notice nor declaration-of-alliance.) But since that cosmic scenario is one of consciousness with an ancillary plot revolving around the factor of \"fiee will\", it ought to be more clear than it apparently is that consciousness is the determinant in the proposal of values \"positive\" or \"negative\", therefore its interpretive relation to matter is the paramount idol to be examined. Nor are the merits of that interpretive relation necessarily what they're conventionally supposed; the discrediting or devaluation of \"finitude\", \"matter\" etc. is often taken as the convenient model for such interpretation, so that \"negative orientation\" is equated with material orientation per se just as \"positive orientation\" is accepted in summary as anti-materiality, contra-finitude etc. However, as we've seen here, the \"dualism\" involved in interpretive consciousness doesn't break evenly around matter/anti-matter orientations; otherwise the Sassani \"philosophy\" might indeed seem operative, ultimately, as an arbitrary choice of \"meaning\" pro-or-con with respect to the experiential field, to \"limit\" and \"matter\" in general. The yogi who polarizes by interpretation \"away\" fiom finitude and the physical field, or conversely the sensualist who polarizes strongly toward it, might equally be considered arbiters of (equiva-"},{"pageNumber":909,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV lently-projective) meanings against a \"neutral field\", choosing their respective realities ex nihilo in Bashar fashion. But, as we've seen, the relation of con- sciousness to the postulate of \"limit\" or creative finitude is stickier than that. Their umbilical relation generates certain archetypal stress values around the form of that relation. More hangs in the balance of the resultant \"interpretations\", than an arbitrary equiva- lency or counterchangeable identity of terms. It is not the question of finitude or \"mat- ter\" that generates positivelnegative meanings, sec- ondary interpretive values etc. (for then \"positive\" and \"negative\" really would have no basic signifi- cance, the principles of Mazda and Ahriman would be players in a relativistic dualism of arbitrary con- sciousness projections...). Rather, it is the interpretive orientation of consciousness itself with respect to the proposition of finitude that generates fundamental questions of positivelnegative value--4.e. is the given orientation of consciousness educive of apositive or negative resultant as the \"meaning\" devolving fiom its relation with finitude? \"Meaning\" then isn't projected upon finitude by consciousness, in Bashar-style, but arises in the interpretive orientations generated between consciousness and the creative field carrying respective implications assessed against the integriw of that relationship. The Ahriman orientation obviously violates the integrity of that relationship even though it's based on it, depends fiom it and has no existence outside that relationship--therefore the Ahriman orientation generates an innate meaning for the Logoic pattern of Resolution (indeed, its \"meaning\" is that of Anti-Logos) insofar as it is internally contradictory by character. Conversely the Onnudz orientation is in congruence with, honors and conserves the integrity of that relation- ship--therefore the Ormudz orientation likewise generates an innate meaning (not an arbitrary projective meaning, of ultimate equivalence with the Ahriman-meaning) for the Logoic pattern of Resolution. From this we may draw two important conclusions. The Light of Reversal cogently described in Lurianic Qabala, while not further specified as such in existing redactions by Chaim Vital is clearly equatable with the negative principle as a conscious interpretation toward the factor of creative limit; it is thus the equivalent of Ahriman in Zoroastrianism, and is properly identified with Lucijier in Judeo-Christian tradition (Lucifer means Lightbearer, so that the identification of Reversal with a phase of Straightlight in Lurianic Qabala secures their correspondence). It is the Anti-Logos. At the same time, the unequal and non-equivalent generation of meanings--by the respective orientations-through the relation of consciousness with the creative field, demonstrates that the Sassani philosophy (of equivalently-projective meaningsfi.om consciousness to the creative field) participates in the implicit tendentiousness of the Light of Reversal for which a sufficient Victory is secured in the direct one-to-one equivalency of terms (where everything's equal to"},{"pageNumber":910,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV everydung else in the sense of absolute \"weight\" or truth-value, since everything's ultimately arbitmy). That's what Ahriman wants: \"hey, it's all just equal. That's fair, isn't it?\" * Is Matter Mirrorly A Maze, Or An Amazing Matter Of Minimist Gaze? There is, then, an optimum Way in which the value corresponding most directly to absolute becomes encoded, as cross-key patterns of resolving tumblers to the finibied Lock of physicality. In this sense, those esoteric teachings which inferentially depict the Abysm of Existence as a Questionmark configuring a Rebus, an anfkactuous maze of matter and of daedaiian energy- paths constituting an omnipresent conundrum of--and for--consciousness, take their justification fiom this aspect of the Mystery; the perennial Teaching certainly conkns by unanimity of overall Form against the streamlined \"wisdom\" periodically outcropping hm our brush with sages who insist the Puzzle-approach (of progressive exercise, esoteric study and investigation of planes) is superfluous, and indeed unbecoming of a Reality which is always nothing other than Us and thus presents itself wholly, without cryptography, in the immediacy of every personalized Presence so that all one need do is cultivate non-problematic bare atrention in renouncement of the complicated forms. This is the gist of most \"zens\", \"gyanas\" and their variations (i.e. Krishnamurthi-ism); for the source of the slight \"misapprehension\" embedded in this approach, see \"Initiates' Comer\", A Critique Of Jnana Yoga etc. We must side with the perennial wisdom-teachings, in insisting that the run of sages agreeing with the \"bare\" assessment described above have emerged into manifestation with a blind-spot blocking apprehension of the background angle fiom which they have approached. It remains necessarily true, therefore, that long prior to any \"simple lapse\" into uninterrupted \"witness consciousness\" certain threshold realignments and transdimensional adjustments of the mind-body form (locked into its typical anisometric focus through stylistic patterning of perceptual/cognitive learning models) must minimally be made so as to render practically available the uncovered convergence-point or common denominator void locus of interactive variables--representing the factor of conscious indeterminacy itself as the volitional root of all impression, psychic charge and influential phenomenology.

Without recognition or acknowledgment of the qualitative transition of this juncture, the \"esoteric school\" remains incomplete and fails to incorporate precisely that tenn of wisdom for which the standard Sage model emerges in the over-strained effort at compensatory emphasis. Without recognition or acknowledgment of both the Presence and the transitional Meaning of an Abyss, there is inevitably presented a linear extension and persisting application of the very same seeking processes thus-far descriptive of the curriculum; the same exercise of mechanical technique, experimental \"muscle building\" of the subtle faculties etc. is the inevitable recommendation at such an invisible juncture as well so that the teaching remains uniform bottom-to-top ... and, by doing so, unwittingly demonstrates a ceiling to the usefulness of the teaching and its informing philosophy altogether. All such esoteric teachings are modeled after interminable pilgrimage, in their corre- sponding philosophies. They may be identified as such. Their tacit form is the absolutized asymptote4e eternal \"approach\", always in-the-process of arriving, always in the mid-motion of getting there, advancing, closing-in yet with no theoretical room for a denouement, no sense of completion except as a provisional transition-state to progressively \"higher ground\". Whereas we affirm that \"progression\" is a suitable model for all educative forms \"below the abyss\", we must insist that there is an altogether different Standard and hallmark of orientation to be understood when assaying that discontinuous threshold Crossing. For at this juncture the real signijicance of \"absolute becoming encoded as cross-key pattems of resolving tumblers to the finitized Lock of physicality\" takes on a critical and decisive aspect. At this juncture the compara- tively naive notion of \"denouement\" as something that must come at the logical end of a given sequence (a notion which holds the lesser teachings in permanent hypnotic thrall) is kindly requested to bow out. At this juncture the \"steps\" of matter, the Jacob's ladder of the DNA code (with its filamental Moebius-twist into the multidimensional subtlety of variable-option etheric patterning, i.e. the chakras and meridians etc.) have been modified in their habituated \"sequences\" by appropriate occult exercise, made to forge alternative energy-keys to the plexiform locks of mindbody biochemical tumblers all under the guiding ideotype of \"going\"; the changes educed in taking those methodical steps, however, have resulted in the development of a \"next step\" which"},{"pageNumber":912,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV is tricb indeed, and which if one is not watching where One is going will be conveniently interpreted as a step-in-kind and not taken with redoubled caution by soberly-intensified consciousness as a threshold Moment quite dzyerent in kind, and not continuous with the modifications-of-matter that \"led up to it\". For this step is, properly, the jumping-off-place for Consciousness itse& and such a transition is of a qualitatively different sort. Maw it all the more seductive (and even fatal, for schools continuing to coach such a step as just an advancement of the preceding sequence) is the circumstance that the requisite mind/body alignment-intensification must in all cases succeed in establishing the given ego-psyche at the same juncture where the void value of consciousness necessarily shines through and illumines the cognitive domain, like Light through stainglass. Thus the light shing through the tesselated panes of glass may easily impart the quality of consciousness to the intervening forms. The stainglass forms, decoratively distributed in a spiral asymptote, seem to \"lead\" directly to some sequence limit of \"most brilliant\" consciousness (since the colored panes--the subtle and gross forms-dct as variable filters, they appear to configure consciousness as a matter of \"degrees of light''4.e. they extend the notion of \"sequence\" as if it existed now in the verypresence of consciousness, was led directly or coaxed by consciousness as a dzflerential Presence rather than as, previously, a tacit absence toward which the pilgrim's progress was continuously gauged and djusted). Therefore without adequate recognition or acknowledgment of the tral~svalwtive char- acter of the Abyssal transition, the illusion of seqmtially marching \"across the abyss\", of ''reaching the far shore\" and continuing on across the perspectivally-convergent Ground of Absolute Itself toward Its own ever-receding Horizon etc. may be carried on inde~tely, as it is with the esoteric traditions of most yogas, of the Soul Travelers, Eclcankar, Sufism and the Sound-current et al. Therefore the Model school of the Mystery Tradition ought necessarily to have two major phases, one teaching fiom the conventionalized (and thus accessible) point-of-view of Progress, below the Abyss; and the otherCor those very few who reach it-teaching a discontinu- ous adjustment with the value of consciousness-absolute in ItseZfso that It ceases definitively to function as the Carrot at the end of the stick but rather Remains as the Miform essence, beached on the still shore with the ebb and comparative recess of all cognitive strains and filters, serving as the Common Ground through which the form, sequence, code or pattern of any plane, dimension or world may be resolved thereafter without \"moving fiom the spot\". It's for this reason that we identify the Mahayana school of Tibetan Buddhism as the best available example of a complete Model from the traditions (though it has ceased functioning as such in modern times) with its two distinct phases, the preliminary Way of Means and the greater Way of Ends. The only school of comparable completeness (beside the ancient Egyptian initiatic tradition, which isn't publicly available in its entirety to study) is that of Lurianic Qabalism; but that teaching hardly survived its Teacher intact (see panel insert). Seeing Through The Ideotype That which distinguishes, describes and accounts for all mindbody patterning configu- rations, all phases and operative intensity-values (the relative efficiencies, alignments, integrations and density-properties of all metabolisms, instrumentations and circuitry) is the governing ideotpe. We've had occasion in this and other T-Bird essays to discuss the ideofonn character of existence. The ideotype is the guiding idea fpology for the given focus of rnind/body patterning processes."},{"pageNumber":913,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Thus we may say that the similarities and differences fiom time to time, place to place and culture to culture with respect to styles of perception, modes of behavior, general syntactical construction of the field or cognitive \"grammar\" are a function of the prevailing ideotype in each case. The typifying structure of Western consciousness with its verbaVanalytic left-brain emphasis and corresponding, isolative modes of perceptionkognition is a reflection ofthe prevailing typal influence. The traditional Eastern configuration of mind/body processes, or classic ~ibal forms of consciousness, reflect the right-brain emphasis indicative of an overall ideotype orientation. Within each such general orientation may be identified local adaptations of type, specific configu- rations of mind/body process indigenous to geographical and historical zones enriching the type with endless variation. Anthropological comparison shows that the \"commonality\" of the human family hosts a great range of actual cognitive, perceptual and behavioral modes; and each such aggregate indicative of a time, place or culture configures a \"complete\" worldview, not simply in the sense of conceptual interpretation but in terms of what and how things may be experienced altogether. Beside the distinctions in organization of brain-function readily discerned by these comparisons, we must acknowledge there are deep variations in the overall patterning of the rnindlbody economy, the functions of immunological response, differences in the relationships between waking, sleeping and dreaming states, even operational differences in what the worldview (guiding \"cosmology\") allows to be done, either as \"nonn\" or as \"exception\" (as when tribal cultures allow the possibility into their universe of influencing, controlling or affecting others \"magically \" at a distance, by psychic \"spirit\" transmission; or when Western technological cultures \"permit\" only those influences-at-a-distance which emerge as technological extensions, servo- mechanisms of the gross physical appendages modeled after the--allowable--range of their motions). The ideotype is then the overall, abstract unitive Praenomen (in the sense of the \"first independent element of a namew--in biology, this is usually the generic name); it is the inclusive, purely noetic intelligibility fiom which all implications of mind-body configurational variables issue, and are functionally patterned. AN patterning processes for the mind/body form of a given culture are weaned as expressions of the governing ideotype so that behaviors, cognitions and perceptions broadly conform to the requirements of that type and reinforce its standard in a \"self-fulfilling\" manner; the cultural variation of the ideotype is the Cognomen, the qualifying ''surname\" for the general global ideotype. Subcultures within the culture may elaborate orienta- tional \"worldviews\" or specialized angles of their own, thus further modifying the general type as an Agnomen or qualifying addition. This is relatively easy to understand, in that there's obviously a general Typology for the planet which furnishes the overall ground of agreement permitting personalities fiom very disparate cultures to identify common features and shared phenomenologies supporting a basis of (minimal) communication; at the same time, there are obviously specialized modifications of the general shared typology which make it progressively dzflcult to agree upon details, interpretation, orientation, permissible and impermissible behaviors etc. (as when the Aztecs had to be trained to perceive the approaching ships of Montezuma on the waters, since they had no precedents for the particular form-in the same way, \"earthlings\" are having to be trained to perceive UFOs by actual cognitive shifts and mind/body realignments, since these modem Montenuna-vessels ordinarily occupy a portion of the perceptual spectnnn long concepmally filtered and focused by opaque-screen"},{"pageNumber":914,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV format in such a way as to be recessed, fiom earlier infant-availability to enculturated adult-imisi- bility). Taking into consideration the sum of what may survive a culture to be studied (the art, literature, philosophical treatises, architectures, military gear, styles of agriculture and technology, trade, traces of empire, calendars, mathematical modes etc.) and correcting as much as possible for cultural projection, a changing form identifiable as the ideotype may be traced in the profile modulations fiom Greek to Roman civilizations, fiom medieval to Renaissance times, fiom the Age of Enlightenment to concurrent overseas models such as feudal Japan or the Ming dynasty. Thus the ideotype may be grasped as a summary cognitive grammar or abstract Word enunciated as cultural, societal or racialfit and loaded with local adaptations, characteristic mind/body codes, keys of apperception, stylized archetypal masks and shared ontological principles tailored to diverse cosmogonies honoring the requirements of time and place. The ideotype may be understood as the coherently adjustive variable of a global grid-pattern: the \"pattern\" aspect comprises the versatile extensionality of the nature-field, or creative limit; the \"variable\" part expresses the indeterminacy belonging to the void-locus of such extensible representation, the petaled zero-low of hazily overlapping coordinates composing the calyx of consciousness (folded like paper of an origami flower as universal substance--and ultimate referent-for all such representative world-form). The ideotype is the Void-Word, the Logos of the projective field. The void-variable portion diagrammed into the grammatic architecture comprises the resolving Pleroma or univer- Savcross-cancelling juncture between \"subject\" and \"predicate\" establishing consciousness as the volitional dweller-in-the-midst, capable of enacting elastic polarization-alignments through divers styles of cognitive conjugation permitted by the common (void-variable) value of convergent and coinhering pattern coordinates. It is that which enables both aborigine and scientific \"atomist\" to perceive a given rock in the outbush, incorporated in the one case however as magnifying mazelike topology of a self-involutive spirit quest through dreamtime and in the other as target boulder of a cobalt-bomb experiment. The meaning and function for \"rock\" is given by the ideotype; yet in no case is it an arbitrarily projective meaning on a neutral or indifferent field, for each hctions as an equation of relative harmonyfinharmony in the correspondence-relationship between whole being conscious- ness (the power of the volitional void-variable) and the representative pattern-of-being. Each (differential) interpretation of \"rock\" expressive of the particular ideotype gives the characteristic psychic coefficient for that relationship. And Now, A Word Through Our Transpondor Having identified our contextual \"ideotype7' as a kind of Word, it should be apparent there's a \"higher octave\" of the ideotype. Here we'll find the full value of everything implied when it's said that consciousness locates the Means of reconciling the \"two\" characteristic statements of absolute and relative, by honoring Limit's stipulation that it enjoy \"infinite continuity and congru- ence in its ownfinite tenns.\" The chief sigmficance of ideotype is that of a meta-cosmic Word, a Logos in the sense of primary creative issuance. This draws us to its full value for which all planetary, cultural and subcultural versions are local adaptation under conditions of perspectival \"obliquity7'. It's the Grand chord fiom which echo our tribal ideotypes (Pharaonic Egypt, the Tang dynasty, Holy Roman"},{"pageNumber":915,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Empire, Vedic India) in turn composing, in various keys, mindhdy harmonics of the \"familiar\" dimension. Such principal value of the ideotype is rooted in the Ground of Being. We've come to recognize that Being is an apodictically conscious quality, predicating the primary Selfhood of existence. The meta-cosmic ideotype taking its immediate infusion from that Being, necessarily renders the multidimensional process in its totality as the venue of Self-cognition. The ideotype (as primary, Logoic value) gives the summary abstract pattern or whole- being Statement declaring compositional elements of a Great Way wherein absolute-being may enact and fulf2.I its implications through finitized forms of expression. It \"speaks forth\" basic ontological principles, in configuration-spaces and personifying patterns giving variable combina- tive features of all worlds, planes and dimensions. It proclaims the modeling fiamework for representational qualities and (psychically-surcharged) properties through which consciousness may assess itself in differing degrees and modes: as its own apparent antithesis (un-consciousness), affirming itself by the \"indigenous\" resource of Negation thereby using its effectual absence as a teleological lure; as vital-subconscious units, processes and patterns enwrapping itself in the form of an extended function without reflexive awareness of the function; and as universal integration of all hierarchies, worlds and planes in symmetrizing order and potentially-whole resolution through a commonfcoaxial Pleroma coincident, in principle, with Itself, thereby coming to itself as a form of awareness able to reflect upon its own presence indirectly or directly, and to feel itself reflected in every cognhble thing. Such ideotype in the meta-cosmic sense of Logos draws directly on the whole-value of Being; therefore the whole-value of Being is its only occupation, informing its functions through every style, representative expression or patterning combination no matter by how much it may appear to \"deviate\" across the sights of some resultant perspective. Whole-being value comprises its essence, aim, meaning and the heart of its eschatology; it is the tem of identity between consciousness and the phenomenological fields, so the psychic equations expressive of that integral relationship necessarily assert representative and symbolically-allusive meanings in orientation to a common referent, of which they are the form and function. All The World's A Stage, All The Players Mirrorly Man-erisms It's for this reason that, fiom the extrovertive and literalizing \"perspective\" the meta- cosmic pattern may appear to be a giant stageplay where all the players run about in random independence excited over something \"out there\", beyond themselves pointing and gesturing and gibbering toward each other or past each other so that the audience tends to follow along the trajectory of each divergent digit into a space of hanging incompletion, all cul-de-sacs and abrupt breaks, vacant pauses in a ragged air of arbitrariness-irregular termini posted with questionmarks and contradictory roadsi p... Yet that same stageplay, by mystic retroversion into the dream sense of symbolic appearance reveals itself as character variations on a single theme, indefinitely interconnected and complementary models of a configurational interface synchronously adjusted and symmetrically self-compensating in all motions and relative gestures on a global scale so that--regardless the literal direction toward which an actor may be oriented--all lines and trajectories constitute mutually"},{"pageNumber":916,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV mirroring references of their own (integrally-intensified) Unity as the field and expressive identity of Whole-being value itself. Thus the meta-cosmic ideotype is universal Logoic qression bequeathing all worlds, planes, dimensions and states within its Transcendental Bailiwick through the dowry of a common Term, a unitary Form of thematic, structural and symbolic consistency under all conditions even of maximum variety and day-glo differentiation so that they all cohabit at infinity, participate in one another no matter how \"objectively distant\", serve a mutually-regulatory order and exist as a single Function of uncountable versions and parts. Owing to this deep formal commonality through which dolphin, homo sapiens, gorilla, whale and bipedal reptoid share the same potential of self-reflective awareness, one need fear no longer to raise the Shade of anthropomorphism and boldly invoke its classificatory power as with the Man-like Tree of Life since \"anthropomorphic\" needn't sirmifv a self-centered projection on dissimilar things but may allude instead to a shared Logoic structure as readily modeled to the nth degree of accuracy on the Pattern of Man, as anything else. Straining The Murk From Merkaba The ideofom character of Logos accounts for the nascent Order within the chaos of limitless potential; indeed it limits the notion of \"chaos\" to systems of intelligible unity so densely integrated and extensively copenetrant at a given saturation-level they're diacult to discern through the available perspective. Therefore \"chaos\" invites creative filtering of a facultative grid-ne-network able to model a dynamically consistent, stylized self-representation sifting conformal elements of its pattern as coherent refrence of unity. For this reason, \"chaos\" signifies a kind of provisional \"concealment\" of hidden order (or ordered hierarchy) within the amorphous admktme; its state doesn't justify an identification with anarchy, as the variability of its \"internal relations\" remains a potential coherence owing to the abstract-ideoform chamcter of its constituents. The relationships that emerge fiom it are inevitably relationships of correspondence, not combinations with arbitrary referents as if fixed by a rootless whim of \"meaning endowment\". Such relationships emerge with implication, as soon as coordinative networks for cognitive functions preliminarily align properties in perspectival reliej strings of related material are pulled along so that grouping by affinity multiplies in intelligible aggregates, without laborious modeling of \"pieces\" as if chaos were an atomistic dust of inwardly unrelated potential. This is the sense in which the static \"Throne\" in Qabala breaks a fiagment (isolates a holonomic \"area\") from itself that's hurled into the Abyss, transforming Throne into the dynamic Chariot of Merkaba. One end of it stays above the abyss (i.e. maintains its relationship with abstract unitive wholeness imparted through absolute spirit-being); the other sifts progressive order from the admixture of chaotic elements below until the Word-pronouncing upon that emergent order-is stimulated to discharge from the High Ground as Intonation of wholeness through and upon the declared elements of cosmos. The order thus represented, comprises the code by which all delimiting potential of consciousness serves, configures and ultimately comes to Real-ize the eternally self-same Void value of (hitless) absolute Identity. It's the means by which that Identity confums itself identical under all conditions, the only One in an exhaustless universe of potential company."},{"pageNumber":917,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV A Logoic Mood-Ring: OM'S Ohms In The Omphaloskeptic Circuit Thus all energies, states, entities and 'elements through which the dimensions are organized and interact, are by nature psychic qualities. As ideoform representation of conscious wholeness, they serve to characterize that wholeness to itself in expressive form; as such symbolic surrogates of wholeness, they pack unthinkable \"numen\"--they purport in their conditional being to account for consciousness, substitute for or satisfactorily serve the complete equivalency of conscious wholeness, so that qualities configured as noetic intelligibility or ideoform abstraction at the same time give the interpretive valuation of consciousness in tones of charged emotion. The innate quality of the manifesting field-of-being with all its energies, powers, properties and dominions is that of psychic aflectiviry; the world is the emotional depiction of consciousness to itself, deeply involving the value of its identity-from which is required an indispensable investment, in order to impart unity to contingent terms--and the heaving of its heart in order to distill the most refined verisimilitude and loving correspondence from the profusion of representative potential. Tbis describes what the Process of the World most-intimately Is. There's a variable mood that runs through and informs the components of creation; its energies are an assessment of the comspondence, the net degree of harmony/inharmony '%thus far\" accomplished in securing the Identity of Absolute-being even under all (Lovingly-allowed) condi- tions. Such multiplied mood is the essential means by which Identity encounters its correspondences in conditional tenns, from the point of view of Perspective and as adaptation of Its etemality of unconditional Love (the motive consequence of Its being an infinite Self-conformance, homogenous congruence and Self-identical agreement through all possible qualities, and In-itselfjince all such qualities are comparative expressions of Itself). Symmetry-Breaking At The Line Of Scrimmage: Roughing The Even-Handed Field Ref Multidimensional states of the meta-cosmic ideotype configure their complex, coinher- ing potentials as varying projection-angles of an (indeterminately extensive) geometry; they live out mirroring psychic cosines, in coherent equations with reference to the abstract whole. Their vehicular presence may be imaginatively grasped as a kind of Crystal matrix, through which whole-being is reflected in prism facets each \"line\" of which is itself a (representative) whole. Geometry signifies, first of all, ideal relations. Though the term refers to the practical concretion of real magnitudes to be measured and modified (like mountains and aqueducts) it takes its primary being as the purely noetic function of number, abstract and ideal, prior to any appearance in comparative materials. \"Geometry\" is a statement of indefinitely extensive yet lam sponta- neities, of co-implication and involvement as when Euclidean postulates produce the five sacred solids or uniform polyhedra uniquely fulfilling the special conditions of symmetry for an organically nested order. Forced against an abstract wall, Plato's geometrizing God would characterize Himself as a dimensionalking system of diflerential aflnities, mapping allowable flowlines as keys to the governance of combination and interaction sifting cosmos from chaos."},{"pageNumber":918,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Geometrized spaces with their characteristic rhythms, rates, ratios and coordinative number-values establish modes of interaction interpretable as the several \"force-fields\" of nature.

For example, wave-pattern behavior-iight, water, air, flame--observed through the 3rd-density lens, describes an ordering geometxy of form such that only integral values and their sub-multiples may characterize conditions of the medium (waves don't propagate through water in uneven/fhctional states regardless the size or shape of the container). Such a property is a numerical characteristic; it isn't a \"function of the medium\", since the medium is a condition of number. And number is clearly a noetic value (i.e. purely ideofom and intelligibly abstract, a power of consciousness). The neter (noetic standard) of Number underlies the sensuous topology of the given, formal order. Our \"known\" physics has puzzles, and these puzzles are explainable with reference to an informing symmetry; such a symmetry may be variously mapped by superposition upon the elements to be resolved, so that in elastic rotation around the phenomenalized field an implicit geometry of many phases and facets is noetically \"re~onstructed'~. Any geometry of x dimensions expressible as a complex number equation (real and hughmy components) may be embedded in or expressed as a geometxy of n number of dimensions. In this way structures having varying properties in the coordinative fiamework (with respect to the exclusion principle, spin angular momentum, charge, coupling constant etc.) may be resolved on the scale of an abstract higher-di- mensional geometry integrating the comparative values to an inclusive symmetry. Many such physics-puzzles are modernly \"explained\" through demands of an underly- ing symmetry effectively governing the number mysteries of integer, half-integer and rational-h- tion charges etc. At the symmetrizing unification-scale \"arbitrary\" parameters reveal their necessary logic as the expression of a constant zero-sum referent, the universal product of symmetry-conver- gence. The next reasonable question to ask of these resolving consistencies, is how to explain the presence of such a consistent order itself? as if the universe clearly preferred it, though it's not at all clear how it manages to meet the requirements for that preference. Considering such an order emerges through resolution of strict number values in geometric symmetries, it should be apparent the complex pattem-consistency is reflective of some purely noetic type. The habit of the relativistic approach is to expect the emergence of geometry Porn the interaction of forces and fields (which continue to be taken as givens); the operative worldview of quantum theory has borrowed the relativist habit while having to behave as if forces and fields reflect a purely abstract, underlying geometry det enninative of their values--that such values are qressive of the governing geometry, and reassemble its likeness when properly aligned. With what do physicists actually deal, in their \"strange\" world of isospin mirrors and anyons (eidetically uniform particles, indistinguishably interchangeable), discrete spin-values and discontinuous quantum jumps, the abstract cubism in the uniform displacement of quark charges, construction of ideal straightline in the Regg trajectory hm the complex components of the e field, the harmonically progressed intervals in the tables of atomic number and planetary orbits etc.? All such phenomena allude to an informing noesis. The thetic regulmity in the mapping of harmonic"},{"pageNumber":919,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV correspondences and ordering ratios, the fidelity with which essential number values and geometric forms display translation-invariance through \"real\" and \"abstract\" space tend persistently to disclose an informing noetic typology, not itself subject to the differential erosion of forces or irregular modifications worked upon the compound things by flux-fields of space and time but rather modeling the abstract infrslstructures of those fields. Why The Whole Won't Part With Its Parts, Though It Parts Them To Depart From The Whole Certainly, such scholastically-exacting symmetries, regular Euclidean foms and inte- gral relationships mapped in the measurement of waves and field properties tend to evaporate against the emergent continent of broken topological contours comprising the (variegated and richly-irregu- lar) patterns of cognitive experience coordinatively assembled through their ideal values; the noesis of such powerful geometries tends to be suppressed in the tangible profusion of perceptible magnitudes, though its presence winkingly recurs across aggregate zones of focus roughly recapitu- lating, in the pits and marks of macroscopy, those ideal congruencies inspiriting the whole-when, for example, the spiralic twists in antler and condyle, cochlea and conch, the Fibonacci whirls of galactic clouds, pinecone clusters and floral bracts arrest the eye, and wonderment at the hexagonal exactitude of beehive or quartz rouses question of some Mason presence having origmally put calipers and compasses to the scheme. Through all such glimpses and momentary angular sightings (rounding the surprising curves of the macro-order), the noetic field persists as a coordinative harmonic neither spatial or temporal, visual or aural in essential character but constitutive of all such properties and perceptual conditions according to the pattern of rhythms, ratios and interactive angles aligning perspectival identities of the typal grid-network (in this way all the regularities and recursive relationships of being whether expressing periodicity or the nonlinear limit-shape of \"attractors\" etc. testify to and obey an ideofonn grammar, which therefore encodes meaning and intelligible value as afinction of its representative unity). The meta-cosmic Ideotype is, then, the whole of the Order which characterizes and endows every expression or perspectival power of that whole. Every such expression participates in-and-as reflection of the whole, representing its value as the resultant equation of a universal convergence-locus. Every such locus, representative of the whole, while reasonably a \"part\" owing to its conditional angle reflects and recapitulates the totality as a universe-in-itself, accommodating an indefinitely extensive pattern-conelation through the irreducible referent of its being. It's for this reason such a totality has been identified modernly as the holonomic order. The character of every such locus as participatory pattern-index, ensures an endless mirroring regress of the whole within the part and part within the whole. Logos warrants order as the indeterminately extensive and summary conelation of combed and wded patterns, integrating geometric values as psychically meaningful potentials in correspondence with the Whole. For this reason the universe is a living Being, ubiquitously big, extending innumerable tendrils and feelers as if growing toward itself from countless angles, shooting forth antennae and stalks, pods and appendages in subtle feedback of sensitive self-modif~cations from system to system and world to world as it becomes the World for which it was endowed. The ideoform Whole, as ultimate Referent of every partial or perspectival thing and Model mirrored through every form, is necessarily greater than its parts. The greatness it enjoys relative to its parts, derives from its"},{"pageNumber":920,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV immediate correspondence with the groundsf-being, or consciousness absolute, as the ideal term of resolution between finitude and infinite. Therefore while it presides as the typology of all pattern and form within the himework of its multidimensional field, it claims the distinction of the Greater in that it participates uniquely in, reflects and shares the essential being of Absolute. The prototype and informing spirit of Order, its essence partakes of the formless Spirit of consciousness itself. As such, it necessarily lays claim to the key of Resolution between the \"two\" primordial statements, that issued by Absolute pledging \"infinite continuity and congruence even under all conditions\", and that tacit declaration of Limit wherein it vows \"infinite continuity and homogenous self-con- pence on its own, finite terms\". Having Ha& Ready, Set, Go The peculiar or paradoxical position into which this seems to place the Logoic ideotype may appear 'knfunfathornable\", so that the tendency at this point will be to take the conventional religious attitude on the matter and fall back before the impenetrable Mystery, or follow the logic of lesser esotericisms that insist we've struck the pons asinonun of the Unknowable. As unknown, mysterious or unknowable as this Point may be to traditional religions and esotericisms, however, it doesn't seem to afford much problem for set theory. So we may as well consult the latter, and forget the Superstitious genuflections of the former, if we want to have an easy time comprehending the basic position and character of the Logoic proposition In set theory the Omega sign R stands for Absolute Insnity; by definition, this is \"inconceivable\". (Simply consider the Omega to represent here what we've previously denomi- nated \"consciousness absolute\", \"intelligent infinity\" etc.) All ordinals less than SZ (the forms, orders and values which participate in and share the Being of R) possess some conceivable property of R; also dl conceivable properties of Omega are carried by the ordinals which are less than the total (inconceivable) value. The SZ Omega value, represented as it is by the last Greek letter, is nonetheless not part of the sequence. It isn't defined by relativity, comparison or juxtaposition; therefore it is not, properly, an ordinal. The system of ordinals (formal, patterned properties-of-being represented by the order and consecution of number-value) gives participatory modes and derivative functions of the Being R; it reflects and refers to that Being, extending toward the Being through such reference. As such it epitomizes the asymptote, exhibiting the variable which extends toward unity at infinity and which approximates such unity but which has an infinite extent to go before coinciding with that over-horizon infinity. For this reason, however, the asymptote is \"in secret\" already equivalent with that toward which it moves, since securing such projected coincidence and homogenous identity requires an intervening infniity of closing approximations. It's therefore the exemplification and expressive function of the very infinity toward which it moves, and which it apparently covets in the unrequited gesture of its insatiate reference. This asymptote or ordinal extension toward Absolute-being (Mnity) possesses within itself all the ordinals; though the asymptotic curve exhibits the implication of khity, as an ordinal it contains all orders and dimemiom, all forms and finite qualities holonornically ingathered to compose its ceaseless \"going\". Now recall: S2 is transcendent to the totality of ordinals. Yet, since every ordinal less"},{"pageNumber":921,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV than R possesses, contains or reflects some conceivable value or property of Q the requirement arises for an ordinal that embodies the essence of the conceivability of R--that of being transcendent to or greater than all the finite values of ordinals. Thus the finite ordinals (n) necessarily participate in the universal ordinal w, which in set theory is a 6mfinite qression. Is this universal ordinal w, itself finite? No. Is it the simple equivalent, or absolute identity, of R? No. Does it possess and exhibit the same value-of R which is its essential value relative to all finite n? Yes. This is the Ideotype. This is the meta-cosmic Logos, as the expression and Order of Absolute. May this postulate of \"set theory\" be visualized? Yes. There's a schematic that illustrates it well enough in a rough-and-ready way (whether or not it's ever been considered by the \"set theory\" set). Simply imagine that a blank white page is \"Absolute\". Nothing on this page suggests limitation (if we banish the borders in imagination). We can't determine whether its whiteness and blankness is the total absence of everything or the totalpresence of everything (as when all spectra of light add up to \"white\"). Now place a dot on the page. The dot represents the all-potential of limitless absolute-being, i.e. precisely the capacity for Limitation. As a point it's unextended, thereby representing limitation in an \"absolute\" way. As an unextended point, however, it constitutes the basis of potential extension. In the midst of Infinity there's no apriori or preferential bias, no \"handedness\" for such extension. Therefore we may imagine the extensive elaborations of the point in terms of projective radii, non-preferentially arrayed in complementary equivalencies (lengths are arbitrarily \"long\"; they may extend to infinity and still be fimctions of the initial delimitation). Now however we've established another value for the point-limit. As the universal locus of convergence for all its predicate radii, the value which it sums is necessarily zero; all differenti- ated, diametric axes cancel in a theoretically-saturate rotation of contimousperpendi~~~la~ties. The provisionally-distinguished or contrastive radii persist in potential while rendering an eternal, wholesale cancellation of charge, weight, valence, contrast or bias of any kind. Self-evidently, the realization of such value only occurs at the common juncture, the uuiversal locus of symmetric self-cancellation constituting the initialpoint of departure. Since all dimensionalized extension may be summed to a point, the point condenses everything which may be understood in terms of \"limit\". Yet the value it manifests as the median of an unqualified symmetry ceases to convey any part of finitude whatever, even while possessing and summing all the potentiality of \"property\", condi- tionality, qualifying attribute or identifying modulation. Viewed in this way, it petitions acceptance as a transfinite expression. The only \"problem\" with such an easily-visuaiizable scheme is that, in itself, it doesn't help us understand how Absolute may preserve the sanctity of finitude, the guaranteed inviolable legitimacy of the principle of limit in its own right since everything here cancels out to an infinite equivalency. .. As suggested above, the conservation of firnctional limit through a field of pafectly symmetric self-cancellation (so as to avert a stalemate or inertial settling to some static counterbal- ance-of-opposites inferentially voiding--rather than resolving--the creation) is properly repre- sented by a ratio; and as we shall see, there's a sacred proportion that steps in as a quite operational matter, to fill the potentially-catastrophic abyss between the \"two\" values. Indeed the whole \"secret\" of the Logos has to do with the means of \"reconciling\" the perennial incomrnensurables,"},{"pageNumber":922,"pageContent":"MATRIX N the unconstructable or \"irrational\" terms of Phi (the sacred cut or golden ratio figuring prominently in spiral forms) and Pi (formulating the relationship between the circumference and radii of a circle). Understanding that this is so, we should immediately consult the realficnctional model of Logos in order to see in practical terms how this resolution between the finitizing tendency of creative potential and the absolute/whole-being value of consciousness is Figured. Part IV Tube Siddhi, Or Shootin' The Transverse Curl On The BPnu Pipeline In diagram 1, we display four concentric circles touching at a common point. Each has its mot in the protorype of Limit, in this case depicted as the physical sphere. Thus each takes its ultimate point of departure from that prototype potential. The largest of the spheres, labelled Noetic, encompasses and includes the rest. The rest differentiate within it, and each is in turn differentiated within the preceding enclosure. We've already seen how the Noetic dimension of being represents the abstract unity, coherence and intelligent holism of the ideotype; and how the ideotype in its optimal form is a Logos. As further explained in the Mother Terasu essays \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness'?\", the presiding ideotype (Word, Divine Thought etc.) serves to abstract the total Means of Resolution between the mode of finitude (summed in its particular declaration re \"infinite continuity in finite terms\") and the unimpeachable Being of Absolute (expressed through its characteristic formula \"Mte self-congruence even under all conditions\"). As such, it formulates the relation between consciousness-absolute and its lovingly-allowed limit potential as the Spiritual Will to Realize the key of Resolution, and to turn that key in the lock of intelligible Potential in order to enforce every authentic claim of the parties concerned without violating the validity of One (the conservation of which is required) or the Other (the proofs for which are lovingly allowed-for, as a corollary of the continuity of the first). As a universal term essentialking all finite/expressible value permitted by Infinite-being, the ideoform Logos or noetic spirit orients with reference to the delimiting Point presence. In aligning the value of consciousness-absolute with efficient reference toward the finite end of the equation, the Logos of intelligible Means establishes a pleromatic Axis, a universal Median or abstract Line through which Whole-being may be \"folded\" without dumdmg . .. . or compromising itself (in much the way paper may be creased so as to establish an orienting convergence-pleat without subtracting from or \"cutting into\" its Wholeness). Folded through that universal Median, whole-being value configures itself as a totalizing reflex (just as folding a sheet back on itself is a reflex) illumining the coordinative counterparts of the inclusive ideolype as which the challenging presence of our point-locus \"occurs\" to infinity. (Remember that the principle of Limit, while abstract in itself, doesn't \"occur\" to infinity indifferently; it upsurges as a distinct proposition with respect to Absolute, expressible in various ways and always in some way as a passionate challenge to the comprehensiveness of Absolute: thus Limit as a prototype might posit the Question of Who merits true Kingship as the Creator-aspect of Being; it might arise as the Question of Place, i.e. where does the fbitizing dimension of Being"},{"pageNumber":923,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Diagram 1 Diagram 2 908"},{"pageNumber":924,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV have its appropriate home, to what does it legitimately correspond? How does the contractile and compressive fmitude of the Limit-principle in itself square with, or become reconciled to, the All-loving expansiveness of Being as which it was originally allowed?) The Axial Line is \"drawn\" with reference to the delimiting point presence so that its initiating trajectory stretches *om the plenum indeterminacy characteristic of the Consciousness phase; it extends (as expression of such indeterminacy) in an indefinitely prolonged gesture toward the ideal extreme of determinable limit. Thus a preferential Stake is driven through the ground of consciousness, formulated as a polarized \"grain\" of intensified seed-potential differentially align- ing--and selectively enforcing-organizational ordinances that serve to regulate flows in the Logoic relationship between finitude and Infinite (so as to furnish an enduring format of persist- ently-cohesive and intelligible order able to unfold implications of the governing ideotype, without reductively cancelling to a non-preferential equivalence at infinity). Absolute symmetry is a sign of chaos; selection-axis or preferential \"broken\" symmetry adumbrates potential order, yet retains the power of the void-term at the core of its cross-coordinates. There is no comparable bim along the resultant, transverse axis appearing on the pleromatic juncture of Line. The functional range of any given diameter on the transverse plane is, however, set by the preferential presence of the pleromatic axis; the former must be the lesser proportion of a ratio between the two, to conserve the alignment-bias of the latter. Thus the resultant projection-form of the Logoic pattern is fkquently given as a lozenge, vesica, Golden rectangle etc. Therefore polarization through the (differential) Line along its transverse axis is nonpreferential and rotationally symmetric though proportionately tize zed\" so as to generate akind of void-tube, or cylinder. In this way the pleromatic juncture becomes a refiective tube of Self-Illumination (Pipe, in Lurianic Qabala), a Line of void Light establishing a style of selection-axis symmetry as the ideotype seed potential of the Logoic pattern, framing the resolution between limit and Limitless- ness. (Remember*. Absolute symmetry is a sign of chaos; selection-axis or preferential \"broken\" symmetry adumbrates potential order, yet retains the power of the void-term at the core of its cross-coordinates.) The horizontal axis through which we may inscribe a rotational symmew in the transverse plane, represents the permissive limit in the circular distribution of pairs of opposites or complementary qualities thereby circurnscribingparti~lar fields modeling worlds and definitional \"spheres of being\". The functional restriction placed on the diameter of that transverse \"rotogra- vure\", ensures the filtrate selection or variable \"isolation\" ofparticular sets (rather than indiscrimi- nately universal sets) through any given \"slice\" or perpendicular intersection of the vertical axis; thus the vertical axis itself; preserves its presence as the resolving pleromatic juncture (Line) serving the finctional common denominator or void-locus \"extension\" on bekaIf of all the planes and worlds through which it's drawn, or more. properly, which it \"draws through\" Itself. Line To Point: \"Let Me Just Bounce This Idea Off You ...\" For the tube (\"pipe\") of Line may be said to \"convey\" something through its own medium. It draws a particular substance through the very, enabling form of its Presence, fashioned as it is or subtly crafted so as to reflect (and function as medium for) the metacosmic ideotypes pre-existing at inrnity. The ideotypes are the \"material\" of this reflective Line or radiant \"tube\" of self-illumination. This doesn't mean they literally move through the Line as water through a pipe;"},{"pageNumber":925,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1V in this case \"pipe\" serves as medium of reflection, filtering and coherently mirroring the sifted typology against the resistance-limit of the Point presence. Line of straightlight draws upon the plenum reservoir of typologies floating in eternal preexistence at intinity, and actualizes them by focal restriction (thus, Line is oriented with respect to the restrictive or delimiting point-presence, takes its cue therefrom and accepts the vehicular restriction of receival-point as a kind of valvular regulator through which it aligns, focuses, adjusts and coordinates). The reflected typologies are of the nature of consciousness-matter. They pre-exist through the infinity of consciousness as purely noetic wholes, summing the intelligible potentials as which a given fype or style of point limit arises to the all-permissiveness of Absolute. Thus the preexistent ideotypes abstractly form around the potentiating presence of modal Limit, the way a smooth and single pearl is invisibly secreted mud the infinitesimal, \"irritating\" presence of a granule. The point-potential and its descriptive typology preexist as purely noetic abstraction, generated against the continuous possible presence of such a point-interruption in the midst of Infinity. Thus the intelligent Line of Straightlight gives an enabling \"form\" to consciousness functionally reflecting (by mimetic comspondence) the abstract ideohe, independently filtered from the plenum matrix of types--the way one may hold a given idea \"kely\" in focus without having to-\"think through\" the universe of ideas in relation to which it continues to exist. It reflects the ideotype against the concentratedpoint (the eternally-expectant presence of which inrpirits the particular ideotype); the coordinative implications of the ideotype are mimoredfiom the resistive limit of the point at a certain threshold of intensified \"conceivability\", so that the point functions as vehicular medium of the typology it inspires. Therefore the Line of Straightlight (Ruach or Spirit, the Will aspect of consciousness) conveys the ideotype proper to the \"particularized\" point limit, by traversing the zone of potential wherein the resistanck-limit of the point intensifies as a real probabiliq of the Creative Largesse, until It strikes the \"region\" of that potential in which the point is sufficiently red-ized as to constitute the Prakrit or Akashic-space of \"matter\". The ab- stract delimitation as which this denuded Space differentiates from the plenum indeterminacy of Infinity, refuses to accom- modate the traversal of Line through its creative zone of poten- tial any longer, not out of opaque stubbomness+s is often the interpretation--but because it must now be accommodated on its own delimiting terms in order to Mfill its formula and that of Absolute simultaneously. Thus Line, as pleromatic representation of the Void totality of consciousness-absolute, can't \"fit\" into the region- of-being set aside for the intrinsically valid and permitted func- tion of the point-limit (now isolated-out as an indefinitely extensible Continent of drifting \"contour-space\", the prototype of matter-substance). The consciousness-matter of the ideotype reflected by the filtrate purposiveness of Line toward the inter- ruptive Point, becomes reflected ofthe resistance-limit of the"},{"pageNumber":926,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1V point functioning as impenetrable basis of nature-matter. Such reflection polarizes the volitional Line, in effect spreading a Curtain of crystal-faceted Light across the coordinative junctures specified by the anticipatory ideotype as the resultant mirror-modeling of the indeterminate point in the overflow presence of encompassing or \"surr6unding\" Line. How Fulfillment Precedes Un-fuEllment, Or, Too Much Of A Good Thing Can't Be Tokened By Graniha Therefore we may show two basic potentials of this cosmogonic or \"Logoic\" process. There exists the (inferentially) circumscribed field or spatial environs of Akash predicated on the resistive point-limit; and there is the noetic \"atmosphere\" of the Linear median of Ruach or Will of Straightline, a form of consciousness-matter-or reflectively intelligent \"substance\"--convey- ing awareness of the ideotypes as which \"particularized\" forms of the point-limit take their being. Since this Line is the abstract pleroma or universal juncture of Resolution for all polarized potentials springing from the resistive reflection matrix of the point-limit, it may be said to move or \"descend\" through the circumscribed field or potentiated \"space\" known as Nephesh (vital-soul, Prakrit), its Spirit of Resolution drawn by invitation of the ambiguous/problematic nature of the point limit (which, in its restricted character, innately requires help). This \"movement\" is the passage of Line through progressive degrees in the potentiation of the point presence, bringing its characteristic ideotype to various phases in limit's crystallization or apparent consolidation. Thus in certain early phases, the Akash or point limit of nature-matter may seem to enjoy a kind of provisional Resolution with Infinite-value brought to it through Logoic medium of Line; it may seem to dissolve homogenously into Light with the simple introduction of mutually compensatory properties belonging to its \"type\". But this is only for the earlier degrees in the progressive crystallization of its \"desire\" to realize innate validity on its own, delimiting terms. At the critical threshold phase of Receival (of the Infinite abundance brought to it by resolving Light of Line), the encouraged potentiation and intensified excitution of the point presence as it \"reifies\" the sense of its own validity-or right-to-being-from apparent fulfillments with respect to the Resolving Juncture of Line, produces a paradoxical amplification of its inbuilt quality us restriction, resistance and limit so that its ultimate phase will no longer yield an accommodative cancelling to the Light. It's here that the form of the selection-axis or preferential symmetry for the Logoic pattern demonstrates the real importance of its Supernal Logic. Because Of Meher, The Trees Of Eternity From our depiction of diagram 1, we may note how this \"prefefential\" symmetry axis is subtly crafted; for if we take the absolute \"'heart\" or midpoint of the diagram to coincide with the center of the largest, encompassing circle, a Line drawn vertically through the circular centers would exhibit a displacement reference or axial bias through the lesser circles, reinforcing the functional sense of anisometric stress ratios in those circles for which the true coordinative center was necessarily conceived above the governing median oftheir own wnes. For the largest, encompassing circle however (termed Noetic) the underlying absolute symmetry of the Whole remains intrinsic as an immediate, operative principle. It is equally plain to see that this subtle asymmetry f52shioned"},{"pageNumber":927,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV from a Model of absolute symmetry (a model reflected in each circle as an identity of the Greater, yet functionally compromised with respect to the absolute Median term) is concealed by the operative codiguration of the spheres depicted in diagram 2 indicative of our collective (opera- tional) intersection of the Logoic pattern as a whole: Here the lozenge (Tree of Life) form seems to predominate, and the absolute symmetry through which the Order is generated becomes obscured. By the Light of diagram 1, we see that the encompassing value of the Whole is Noetic; the circle generated within it is denominated Mind, simufving the degree of conscious being within the noetic whole through which thepattern of the informing ideotype comes to expression. Within the circle of Mind is generated the Psychic sphere; the psychic dimension of conscious being gives the universe of &ties, the formal correlations in the typologies projected as patterning process. In the Psychic domain all combinative potential for the operative, patterning coordinates discloses an Mective differential at the heart of form, giving variable harmonic states primary symbolic charge as meanings with reference to the Whole, before they are ever reducible to mechanical tern of an indifferently determined \"structural compatibility\" as with the dry appropriateness of \"condyle\" and \"socket\" etc. Through the Psychic sphere emerges the vital-physical sphere, in which the guidingjonn of affined types aligns the suitable structure whereby psychic states of the patterning-process may be enforced (as a self-consistent architecture of coinhering values and meaning potentials). The vital-physical sphere, generated \"within\" the Psychic, Mental and Noetic spheres, is in reality the \"granule of matter\" at the center of the pearl, around which its noetic luster was secreted. Thus though the functional presence of the vital-physical sphere is a kind of emanative reflection hm the preceding consciousness-frameworks, in itself it constitutes the nucleating point-ofdeparture and efficient instigator of the noetidpsychic patterns through which its properties are reflexively organized, elaborated and coordinatively aligned. Playing Through: Guph-in Around On The Final T, With A Nephesh Of A Niblick The vital-physical sphere, while dependingfiom the informing consciousness spheres, is itself Nephesh or nature-matter so that, taken by itself its enabling structures may appear to be a compatibility-mechanics given as product of \"natural selection\", stochastic forces etc. It is not in itself a state of Self-reflective awareness directly transcriptive of the value of whole-being con- sciousness, as are the preceding spheres. Yet it necessarily possesses its own quality of consciousness on its own tern, since as we've seen the discontinuous point limit or basis of Nephesh (vital-soul) gives consciousness to itself in the apparently interruptive form of un- or sub-consciousness. As a style of consciousness it is a domain of the consciousness unit, just as the spheres \"above\" and encompassing it. It is a power of the consciousness-unit corresponding generally to the vegetal kingdoms of nature inclusive of the crystalline-mineral states (it therefore corresponds to the vegetative or autonomic nervous system, in the total self-reflective structure). It constitutes the cross-road intersection between subliminal and self-reflective values of awareness, and is therefore symbolized in animal-forms of the nature pattern representative en masse of varying degrees in the \"hind-leg\" transition to functional congruence with the vertical-\"bipedal\"-4s modeling the (transcendent) organizational Line of the cerebrospinal column supportive of standing man."},{"pageNumber":928,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The vital-physical sphere therefore correlates with the sacral and coccygeal plexuses and the corresponding hindbrain as harmonic loci of instinctual patterns, coded drives and the maze-like repertoire of appetitive self-sustenance giving the infant-form its creatural impetus as emergent awareness in the World; the vital-physical sphere correlates as well with the solar plexrcs, which is the operative transitional juncture between autonomic and consciousness-systems co~~necting them through sp1anch.uk nerves on the one hand and vagus bundles on the other (the sympathetic portion of the autonomic nerve-networks corresponding most closely with the autonomic system, the para~ympathetic processes of the autonomic nervous system correlating more closely with the cerebrospinal or consciousness system). Thus the vital-physical sphere, though mediated by and coordinated through conscious- ness units like the others, not having the degree of consciousness in itself corresponding to the pleromatic (vertical) power of self-reflective awareness is considered discontinuous with the Noetic/MentaVPsychic spheres above it and extrinsic to systems of the soul-being proper. (The sphere of Nephesh or the vital-soul known as Malkuth in Qabah, is shown dependingfiom the preceding Sephirah like a dangling afterthought, though structurally \"tied\" by Sephiroh of Straight- light to the others.) It is not an innate structure of the atankarana (the \"inner instrument\" or essential soul-structure of Hindu terminology). Nonetheless it constitutes the basic point-ofdeparture and- in a very important sense4e raison d'etre of the Whole Tree. It represents the furthest intensification and reification of the causative point-presence (or Pralcrit of nature-matter), its deepest \"invagination\" or turning inside-out so that it seems to constitute the pri~ realify while consciousness appears subordinate to, encased within and dependent upon its resistive and inertial processes. It is a World wherein the corresponding Ideotype is reflected and variably mirrored through the transecting Presence of the Pleromatic column (establishing its resolving and convergent Line at one of several possible intersections, like a Mirroredge placed angularly on a flat picture so that fa-s are reflected more or less according to symmetric coherence); in this sense it's like all the other Worlds through which the Pleromatic Line-& its Psychic, Mental or Noetic phase--acts as plumbline of the densitydegrees.

Rather, the three hypostases Above (Noesis, Mind and Psyche) mirror the whole-sum values of their phases indirectly, i.e. in the unwhole-sum counterpart of their comparatively cooperative nature-spheres--that counterpart known as Nephesh, or the physical world, reifying the principle of resistive and inertial limit to the degree that Consciousness cannot really enter in and thereby belong to such a sphere as an intrinsic value but must mimic any such innate correspondence or belongingness by an attached identification (all the more poignant and impossible since the vital-sphere bears least kinship, in itself, to consciousness-in-itself, being many time removed through angulated and symbolic reflections within the informing worlds above). By tendency of its continuity and persistive self-congruence, descending foxms of Consciousness seek a correspondence of similitude with vital-being in reductive fashion-rather than the reflection-sphere of physical nature adductively aligning in terms of comciousness, as subjunctive mood rendering a cultured correspondence of void-conscious presence. The Secret is that, possessing a variable code-typology of elastic and alternative alignments like all the other worlds and planes, the physical sphere may be aligned through its mirroring correspondences in deeper harmony with the value of consciousness so that its symbol- pictures don't just allude to a Presence several times removed fiom it but serve directly as expressive agency of the whole-being value belonging to consciousness. In this way the structures of the \"physical world\" may constitute a compatible place for the visitation, rest-stop and refkshrnent of the soul-being innately Conscious to the degree of correspondence with the upper Worlds; it may house and shelter that consciousness, the creative attention of that consciousness, enhance the available energy of that consciousness (by adding an effective domain of Resolution to Its axis), while never again casting the post-Edenic spell of one-to-one identilied equation with its reflexively self-symbolizing terms. In this way the Physical World may come to serve as a Triple-A motel for the Whole-being value of consciousness, fke to come and go as it pleases.

Note that, if we accept the absolute center in the diagram (1) of nested circles as the locus of spiritual balance for each of the spheres respectively, we see first of all that spiritual balance resides outside the physical Wework (the smallest circle) altogether, and appears poised in the surrounding atmosphere \"above the head\". Next we find thaf for the level of Psyche, the point of spiritual balance appears at the browline of a (given) human form inscribed within its circle. For the level of Mind, that same point appears at approximately the locus of the throat. And for the encompassing sphere of Noesis itself, the central Point of which constitutes the absolute center for the system of circles as a whole, the locus of spiritual balance is established at a median corresponding to the heart of a (given) figure inscribed therein. 914"},{"pageNumber":930,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Each of these levels representing hypostatic degrees or powers of consciousness, corresponds to a World of nature-matter organized and potentiated in conformance with the value of the given level. The hypostases of Noesis, Mind and Psyche constitute a three-fold hierarchized Being of Self'-reflective consciousness, a basidly unific Identity of differentiated functions, projections, personality-expressions and degrees of awareness; the physical level enclosed by them (as though it were an enwombed seed-state) constitutes the sphere of Akash or nature matter, of variable densities and grades and representing values of consciousness-potential below the threshold value of Self-reflective awareness, i.e. un-, sub- and protoconscious potentials. Though each of the nested circular levels exists as a total potential of being corresponding to a complete World of cognate activity and knowledge, they're related to one another abstractly as with common concepts of \"dimension\" characterized by \"mutual perpendicularities\". And, though each such level may therefore be conceived as noetically \"perpendicular\" to the next, the congru- ency of kind pertaining to the first three (self-reflective) spheres as contrasted with the comparatively unlike quality of the fourth (un-conscious) sphere causes the three to bear a unitary relation of perpendicularity toward the fourth. Thus the first three hypostatic spheres may be depicted as distributively sharing a common vertical axis, while the fourth sphere associates through the horizontal as though it were their projective shadow. If we regard the first three spheres as translucent or transparent (whatever their charac- teristic \"marks\") owing to their more direct identity with unclouded degrees of consciousness and light parallel the \"upper atmospheres\", we may imagine the whole-value light of (self-illuminative) consciousness shining through them one after the other in staggered dqlay along the Vertical, collecting and casting their contributory properties in flat summation overthe horizontal plane. With respect to the physical sphere receiving the qualitatively discrete values of the preceding states in a stream of sheer superposition amss its comparatively mono-dimensional &, it appears as if all the powers and properties of the Upper hypostases are concentrated through, and occur in homogenous commonality upon, the summary matte of materialily. Viewed in this way, it's easier to perceive what the ancient initiatic traditions as well as their modem counterparts mean, when they state such perplexities as that the \"bloodstream'7 pertains to the \"astral\" state of matter etc. A Cartesian Demon Cuts A Diamond Card The appearance of the self-apprehending system to itself through the physical field of focus, should long ere now have given pause to the enthusiasms of that \"naive realism\" still prosecuted in one form or another by every modem discipline; expecting either that the given sensorium or its accompanying, cognitive fdties should render a portrait of \"the real\" in any way accurate or having a reliable degree of (ultimate) verisimilitude with \"what is\" remains, to today, what it always has been, an mwarranted article of faith buttressed by anemic \"correspondences\" of a superficially practical kind which only \"prove\" the agreement of prefigured complements within a profoundly unfathomable context. Such presumption never surpassed Descartes' \"demon\"; the cofounder of modern secular philosophy (along with F. Baco, you how) stated the probl&natic axioms forming the pons asinorurn of rational inquiry at the outset. They were as plain to him then as they should be to modem investigators now. (How do we know what we know? What grants us epistemological certainty on"},{"pageNumber":931,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the basis of contingent, a posteriori faculties and functions? How do we transcend the petitio principii of anaclitic faculties necessarily taking for granted the very datum evoked to prove its own point?) Modem investigators uniformly take their point-of-departure fiom a tacit faith, a quasi-re- ligious bottom line assumption bequeathed them comsy of Descartes' original \"special pleading\" (i.e. for a Divine all-knowing Being Who, owing to just such status, constitutionally wouldn't lie to us) only long emptied of its original conviction, the deific substance having dribbled away to the secular millennium without notice so that all which is left is the unexamined faith itself, a hollow superstructure with Nobody Home. Now we may see more clearly the magnitude of the problem involved; and we may also perceive, perhaps with happy non-expectancy, that part of tmth which still clings fiom Descartes' original solution. (Oh; did you expect Monty to be programmatically anti-Cartesian in good old \"new age\" fashion, doctrinally dubious that any part of truth could come fiom the old \"cogitors\" of the Renaissance like Francis and Rene? Well, it's not for nothing those two culprits have forenames sounding suspiciously feminine to modem ears--embedded in their \"egregiously macho\" and aggressive philosophies are many subtle reflections and soft reservations unbecoming the negative icons we've made them in light of ecological catastrophe). The magnitude of the problem, lies here: we have no way to assess the truth-value of faculties and processes which allow themselves to be perceived only through prefiguration of their ownpattern. It's for this reason that we've modernly settled on pragmatism alone to rule on \"truth''. And, as we've seen, pragmatism alone doesn't account for the actual truth-value even of things demonstrating experimental domesticability; we see more clearly now how empirical links do not equate in one-to-one correspondence with the phenomenological whole (as when we may activate memories and emotions by electrode stimulation of brain-lobes, yet are no nearer understanding the experience of consciousness thereby). We see the ways in which factors of phenomenological process strobed to operations of our pre-patterned faculties may yield a coherent \"discussion\" of reality in terms of those faculties (as when cause-effect reality perfonns technologically according to our equations; or \"renonnalizable\" mathematic operations yield magical correspondencessf- agreement with \"real\" behaviors of forces and fields); by the same token, we perceive just as plainly how reality continuously surpasses the zones through which we may conduct an intercourse of mirror-agreements between process and pattenaing faculty. On the other hand, in light of our preceding metaphysical examination of the subject (taking its pointsfdeparture in the Noesis of reality, yielding apodictic4erefore irreducible- values assessed fiom the commondenominator Being informing and filtering through the interstices of relativized faculties), we may find again our rightful measure of agreement with Descartes ' original assessment: we may renew our confidence in the authentic co~~espondence between conditional faculties and prepatterned functions with respect to Being (i-e. truth-value) while enlarging the mework immeasurably in which we may exercise that confidence. Indeed we may agree with Descartes that our sensorium and reasoning faculties etc. participate in the Reality of Divinity (Self-evident or apodictic Tmth) so that ultimately, given sufficient self-correction or balance, they may yield reliably-accurate correspondences with that Reality (i.e. \"God\" would not-4timately-lie to us); for we see the way in which all processes and functions regardless how complex or ranging in interpretive faculty comprise coordinative elaborations and projective expressions of basic ontologicaI principles. The ontology behind and informing those functions is immediately accessible, not primarily as reflex activity or self-assess-"},{"pageNumber":932,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV ment of those functions but owing to their derivative participation in whole-being value. Once the \"mask\" of their filtratelfocal operations is penetrated (through threshold realignment of their coordinative operators congruent with the Resolving Void-value, or axial pleroma, fiom which they issue) the Spirit of that piimary value endues the blessed Beholder with the immediate power of discrimination (buddhi, in the Eastern traditions) whereby the conditional may be clearly distinguished hm the unconditional. There is then no further question as to whether the ground of assessment proceedsfiom relativistic and conditional faculties toward some approximated \"truth\" wholly dependent on their configuration to begin with. All relativistic and conditional faculties are illuminated in their fundamental derivation fiom the Ground-of-being (this lifis the burden of truth-value hm their conditional objects altogether); their ontological continuity and principial correspondence with that Ground is rendered Self-evident. This form of Self-eident knowledge is primary and irreducible; it's that which the term \"apodictic\" ought essentially to mean, therefore it isn't just an intellectual certitude-+ when we say the effect of oxygen on iron is \"self-evident\"--rather it refers to the wholly-convincing and transparent certitude of Being when the Self of Being and the Beingsf-Self are exactly identical, without anything at all \"left over\". A Return To Goodly Form In this way we may return to diagram 2 wherein the composite configuration of what we know as the human form and its corresponding field demonstrates how the facultative continuum of that form-yielding processes according to the type of an homogenous plane, apparently participating in and composing the flat venue of that plane--takes its Being in an extended Reality; how the appearance of its own processes ad functions maps itself as compound-synthetic resultant of a refZection grid stylistically filtered, focused and aligned across an in- forming network of ontological projection-fields (flow- ering intensive meta-physical qualities \"procedurally\" in the manner of budding dimensional perpendicularities sprung one fkom the other so that the resultant projection- grid of faculties and functions represents a complex background of \"right angle\" turns coinvolved upon itself in folding fashion giving goniometric specifications for the sum). Each such \"system\" of the reflected human form (apparently coexisting across a single shared field) may now be understood according to the qualiw and ontologicalfinction it represents through the self-configuring plane of cognition; it may be identified as the (progressively modulated) projection of a discrete valuesf-being, carrying that value forward and preserving the integrity of its character in function and form even as it becomes modeled by (and measured to the specifications of) a succession of implied values giving bloom to their own qualities, that \"clothe\" the ontological principles fiom which they derive thus nesting each within the other and summarizing as they go until the first (noetic) value is braided through the vehicular whole, according to the composite configuration-dynamics of the resultant projection grid."},{"pageNumber":933,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Holding to the conceptual model of diagram 2, then, we may understand how esotericists can say the circulatory system/bloodstream of the human form corresponds to the \"astral\" state of being (esotericists may come to an inkling of what they've meant as well). More than that, such model gives a productively different basis for the classification of systems germane to the human form. While noting, on aggregate, conformable wholes paralleling the discrete systems mapped by modem bioscience from its angle, it becomes possible to identlfy and correlate such interacting wholes according to a hework which values them fiom subtler perspective. Thus their general outlines may retain recognbble shape with the analytic research of science (as they should, if there's an essential correspondence amongst the vertically collated levels), while exhibiting lines of relationship not apparent at the physical level but revelatory of higher-order_fimctiom. These non-ordinary lines of relationship make more apparent the integral purpose or overall meaning of the biophysical pattern; more than interpreting the combinative possibiities of immediate mechanical structure, the kinds of configuration disclosed from the \"vertical\" angle exhibit informing organizations of a general value typology (deeply related to what Lord Verulam meant when exhorting the science of his Imtuuration to discern the form of things). Since the form of things belongs to an order outside quantification per se, and indeed grants the criteria by which tabuli of \"quanta\" may make any spiritual sense at all, the failure of the resultant scientific epoch to make any \"sense\" of the injunction toward form in its wholesale embrace of Baconian empiricism accounts for the general quality of cancerous proliferation and randomizing coverage-for-itsswn-sake characteristic of the scientific ethos presently; it accounts as well for the dislocation of bbblarne\" in contemporary misreads of Bacon's intent, as well as average misapprehension of the scope of his understambg and overall character of the philosophical magnum with which he intended to christen the ship of Science depar!jng from the hand-built pier. Subsequent history has obscured that essential subject of form, allowing it to languish as though tiptoeing away from the cloud of incomprehension surrounding its quiet desuetude; yet this is precisely the part of natural alchemy, the sprite of esotericism belonging integrally to the Lord Chancellor's (overall) thought which has thus been hid away like an embarrassingly dotty relative, impossible to explain to the neighbors, so that its very existence is scarcely suspected. If however we were to return to the fateful scene of the initial deviation, we might catch the presence of form ere it's med again in rounding the historical comer; and, by adhering to the logic of diagram 2, we might renew an ancient appreciation of its central place in any classificatory scheme expected to correspond to the most coherentlunilied degree of overall spiritual apprehen- sion. A Transdimensional Assembly Line And The Vehicle Of Cognition Since the horizontal \"shadow\" of physicality falls fiom displacement through the vertical axis belonging to the hypostases of consciousness, we may see first of all that \"physical\" processes encode basic psychic functions. They must be understood above all as patterns of cognition. The basic organs of cognition are coordinated in systems of \"knowledge\" and \"action\", the former belonging to modes of perception and the general sensorium, the latter to overall motor functions. Therefore all the reflectively-analyzable \"concrete\" processes whether digestion, respi-"},{"pageNumber":934,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV ration, reproduction, circulation or perception constitute integral modes of cognition. The aim, purpose, meaning, activity and order of the biophysiological processes and functions is that of cognition; they inform cognition, support cognition and indeed encrypt the very patterns corre- sponding to the \"psychic grillage\" aligning intelligible coordinates of cognition.* Note therefore that, on the horizontal axis where the vital-physical field is reflected, the innermost circle depicting the physical zoneper se is compounded of patterning coordinates actually corresponding to states and planes dimensionally discrete along the vertical axis. This implies, then, that there is no physical world \"in itself', or rather that such a world is the resultant compositelfocal alignment of sentient domains along an axis perpendicular to the projection plane through which its grid-network models itself as the \"thousand things\". We may extract further implications from this diagram. First of all, the enclosed (innermost) circle of the horizontal plane represents what we ordinarily know of the material world. From the perspective of this schematic, it's obvious we ordinarily perceive only thephysical part ofthe aggregate material world; equally as obvious, there's more to the material world than this physicalized cross-setion exclusive to our general perception. Informing the physical system and comprising intrinsic elements of its composition (as if guiding, adjusting, regulating and generally \"advising\" its processes) are nested gradations of patterning coordinate-states reflecting the relevant qualities of conscious hpostases, projecting their respective standards of Influence \"through the perpendicular\". Thus we may easily see that the \"most-physical\" focal grade of the material world as a whole, is informed by \"etheric\" states of matter conveying values of the hypostases in correspon- dence with the respective Worlds to which each such hypostasis belongs on the vertical axis. The immediate \"current\" of etheric-material process informing the compound physical projection field is therefore one which reflects, conveys and is inspirited by the value of Psyche; it imparts gffined influence giving the symbolic charge as which physicalized structures are coordi- nated, and reflect their ultimate significance back to the \"cognizing subject\". In turn this current is informed (at virtual \"right angles\", within the fbmework of the vital-physical field as a whole) by processing currents organized according to the characteristic pattern as which the material order of perceptions is projectively aligned. The pattern---ling ratios, rates and coordinative harmonics corresponding to the given \"type\" of the cognitive field--constitutes the intelligible gestalt of Mind which is their Life: the meaningful, directorial coherence underlying the continuous organization of wholes. Therein is directly implied the character of the basic mind/body current informing the rest; inspiriting the organization of wholes is a unitive we, an abstract/ideofoxm standard reflective of the essential idem@ as which the order of patterning coordinates aligns itself; such standard is * We've encountered the subtleties involved in this definition before, when it was noted that the Sorcerers' Way of Castaneda's \"Don Juan\" closely parallels our hierarchic insiience here in claiming that the whole mindbody process is that of a \"bubble of perception\"; we have elsewhere lodged our preference for expressing it in terms of a vehicle of cognition. This isn't semantics. It reflecu a deep difference in the estimates of respective \"paths\". There is something very much of the vital, still, which clings to the Sarcerer's insistence on the premiere value of perception. It hauls in the whole realm of naturematter per se, in its definition. It is the business of the Sorcerer to \"perceive worlds\". It is the business of the Magus to \"know Being\".

This principal etheric-material current reflects and conveys the value of Noesis fiom conscious domains of the vertical Axis. Versatile Virtues And Variable-Option Appointments On The Luxury Dash Of The Cognitive Vehicle We are now able to perceive a general purpose and function for the mindbody form along with its organs, nerves, currents and instruments priorly unavailable to the physical faculties alone. With help of diagram 2, it becomes plainer that the interrelated systems process an overall power of cognition having ideofonn, patterning, formative and structuring parts. What we perceive of \"the world\", inclusive of that mind/body form beheld according to its own agency, is the projective resultant of a stylized ordering of properties proceeding fiom ontological ground, the \"objective\" part of which is modeled at an angular intersection representative of; but subtracted fiom, the immediate totality through which noetic holisms and abstract congruencies of the participating principles are endued. This implies there are variable ways in which idktmcture processes of the resultant, objecthized pattern may be given; the informing principles may be modeled in combinative alignments begetting alternate libraries of living symbols, lighting themes of the Cognitive grid-network through its own incandescent filament. Like shadows of the same object cast by differently angled light sources, some may appear similar to one another though slightly displaced by subtle gradations, and projecting distinct qualities; while others may seem exotically different or of altogether separate character, as if belonging to another order of existence without reference to the former. We may perceive glowworms and galaxies, Madasqar tigers and New York taxi drivers; but we may, with the merest displacement of a few coordinative threads, apprehend principial powers of our own processes in projective terms of Titan towers, palaces of the moon and glowing nightseas, devas of the wood and undines of the lake, mirror-world corridors in a fungal maze and phosphene elementals floating witch-webs of geometrized silk over shivering meadows of dew ... Understanding this self-modeling variability as a basic factor of the Being which is noetic before it's comparatively \"material\", we may grant abstractly the existence not only of that standard anatomy/physiology given to the Grey faculties but of other, \"complementary\" systems or alterna- tive perspectives through which subtle meridians as well aspranic flowlines and fields may emerge, as viable depictions of processes or powers screened out of the \"flat\" anatomical texts printed hm strictly physical plates but naggingly present (if ordinarily unaccounted-for) all the same; and we may appreciate the unexpected availability of practical means for realizing such abstract potential perceptually, so that \"rumored\" states and rarefied planes of function needn't remain a matter of inference fiom ambiguous results measured by a merely material gauge. It may now be understood that, by the \"material\" field of the mindtbody form we mean not only the known vital organs, the plexuses and ganglia, endocrines and exocrines but the rarefied subtle flowlines of a coherent energy-network parallel the physically focused centers-the chakras and nadis of an extended system having its own perceptuaVcognitive correlatives securing its estate"},{"pageNumber":936,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV on its own self-characterizing plane. There is a stylized vital-physical field of focus (the one we \"know\"); and, tuning the next level of coherent adjustment, the cross-section panels and capillaxy pressure-pumps of the corporeal form dissolve hard edges favoring the general halation of a phosphorescent flow-field, surrounding and enveining the lingering shadow of fleshly tubing. In turn a subtle adjustment of mindbody alignments may be made, so that the self-representation it educes on its own behalf polarizes previous pulpy folds and lines of fuzzy glow into complex mazes and regressive mandalas of flowering wheel-geometries, generating oddly understandable picture symbols of the soul record. Systems And Integrated Circuits: Knowing Maintenance Requirements Of The Cognitive Vehicle, - And Where To Get Spare Parts Just as we may say that, taken as a cross-sectional \"whole\" on its own perspectival plane there is a collective current (representative of the total system of innervated organs) known as the vital-physical, we may acknowledge the presence of additional dimensions to the general body- mind; informing and organizing the projected \"phase space\" of the vital-physical current is the fZui&atety current of material ether, and, inspiriting the formative force of the watery current is the patterning,fluidaity current of material ether. Imparting ideoform coherence and abstract organizational unity to the airy patterning current, is the radiant/Fety current of material ether. As we've seen, these participatory currents (extended muitidimensionally through the total \"material field\") generate a composite reflection-space through which their processes are modeled to a common perceptual configuration or shared, convergent cross-section appearing as an homogenous substance of standard elements; therefore the systems which are categorically identified through locus of strictly vital-physical perspective, differentiate \"on the same plane\" in rough correspondence to the dynamic enclosures marking their discrete existences \"behind the scenes\" through the multidimensional projection fields. In this way we may say t. though all the current systems are mutually modeled in biophysical materia, the vital-physical current in itself (through which the stylized focal field is mnemonically \"digested\" and structurally encoded to a duplicable consistency of type) corresponds specifically to the digestive system of the material form. Similarly we may say the fluid-watery ether, while corresponding to a discrete level in the overall material-form processing, is reflected in and encrypted as the circulatoty system. The fluid-airy current corresponds to, and is encrypted as, the respiratory system; and the radiant-fiery current correlates with, while being encoded through, the \"generative\" system (as employed in esotericism, an overall term for which there's no exact correspondence in neuroanatomy, signifying the nervous systems in general and relating them, through the endocrines they administer, to the creative and reproductive forces of the physical being). Since each such etheric-material current feeds into, informs and serves as coordinative reference for the others while existing \"in its own plane\", we'll see the ways in which organs and processes categorically allied with a particular neuroanatomical complex appear as participants in, and serve to mss-correlate, the work of the other systems. The vital-etheric currents patterning grades of matter into (variable) composite apper-"},{"pageNumber":937,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV ceptions, comprise in sum the breathing/pulsatory matrix of the physical vehicle. Their circulations give knowledge of lemniscate meridians linking hemispheres, crossing sides and segments in functional translation (and integral correlation) between mirroring moments of the whole. Just as stylistically perceived systems of the physical nerve-network describe comple- mentary distributions of sympathetic ganglia lateral to the spinal column, and parasympathetic bundles fore and aft about that column, so the infeeding energy-currents coordinatively modeling reflex apperception of those networks loop around, cross back-and-forth over one another in throbbing lines of memory-laden light, filaments dense with codes streaming hm stars, suns, moons and planetary chakras only coinherent, without spatial or temporal separations while loaded in the glowing threads--such circulating patterns or snaking lines of subtle connectivity flowing through, and composing the convergence-locus of, the physical vehicle, give angular intersections for cosmic congelations of influence woven through the chakra webs in changing tones interpretable as astrological markings for vital, behavioral and psychoemotional tendency. The immediacy and essential non-separateness carried in these radiant courses, encode matter (physically measurable by distance, velocity, the Doppler etc.) in tern of geometric harmonies giving the net of factorial figures as a living architectonic jewel often emblemized to subtle vision as a summary tiara, shield, badgelike crest or glowing bar. Such circulations in the sequencing lights of the etheric-material field are, as we've seen, transparency-projections across a comparatively horizontal plane ofpavers belonging to conscious hypostuses at dimensional \"right angles\" to one another and, collectively, to the physical field. Atmospheres of the informing hypostases (Identity, Mind and Psyche) invariably produce behavioral flows of the physically focused plane out of their own, characteristic \"breath- ing\" patterns. Down Through Depths Of Feeling; We Float In An Amphibious Vehicle That which is known in the traditions as the Countenance of Microprosopus, is equivalent to the projective ego-soul or inspiriting doer-personality. It enacts the \"human\" in the physical field of focus. Its correspondent affinity is with the Form World, the \"astral\" realm of Psyche. It's that aspect of the hypostases more nearly integrating with the corporal degree of mind/body organization; it aligns most deeply into functional congruence with the complex of vital chakras through which the sensiblelolfactory physicality of the life-patterns is coordinatvely filtered and resolved. The hypostatic ego-psyche is the self-reflexive Soul of Atziluth (the Form World), corresponding to the \"feeling\" astral state. It draws toward a qualitative intensity-value dehble as an emotionally charged identity enrichment. In so doing, it mobiiely aligns along the inbuilt banks of stress-states belonging to its value typology, as a signature circulation of currents sweeping the resistance-limit of nature matter (corresponding to that world) into conformal streams of geometrized webbing. The whorled glow as which that webbing grid-weaves a probative self-inquiry through mists of an (obliquely filtrate) astral light, is reflected in resume under the inversion sheet of swarming scales where Earth's ocean-surface separates land from mirroring leagues of dimming light tapered to astral-like depths wherein corals and anemone, phosphorescent infusoria and jukebox protozoa, delicately structured blobs and glowing squiggles of a bioluminescent sealife"},{"pageNumber":938,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV retrace early signatures of the informing Worlds in a phantasmal euphoria and spirally-distractive abysm. Such webs of nature-matter serve to polarize frameworks of psychic affinity, on behalf of the soul-presence to whose typologies they confoimally respond. In general they format networks of repeating tendency as self'-representative memory patterns, all-absorptive in corkscrew intensi- fication toward threshold values in the alignment of succeeding phase-space potentials (adumbrating orders of implication through mirror-angled media modeling modes perpendicular to the inspiriting psychic current). If the vital-physical circulatory patterns describe a kind of lemniscate periodicity and self-enfolding, the psychic pattern-circulations preceding them outline paramehic values through which the periods and cycles of cosmic physical rotations are extracted. Such parametric values disclose the essential fonn as which all rhythms, ratios and indicative rates discharge. The periodic rates as which the matter field self-organizes may be minimally charac- terized as quantitative. The abstract form through which such cycles are structured must be characterized as qualitalive. The modern approach to an understanding of such form (properly belonging to and issuing fiom the Form World) derives fiom the study of state attractors. Catching Ka@as In A Butterfly Net-The All-Attractive Lotus Floats In Hoor-Prabiti's Soft Parade An attractor is a point or zone of function toward which the elements of a given system collectively tend. There are periodic attractors (electron orbits are an example) and chaotic attractors (plotted as a state space of unstable periodic orbits, having a minimum of three dynamic variables or perpendicular \"degrees of freedom\", without retracing of trajectory but with proximal, upre- dictable repetitions occupying distinct preferential regions of the phase space). The steadily identifiable zones of the demarcated phase space of chaotic attractors are \"held in place\" by what are known as static variables comprising stable parameters4.e. certain variables which become coordinatively fixed and remain set as constants through the life of the system, such as driving rate or velocity, length of rods, tension or tensile strength of coils etc. While scientific study of attractors tends to remain quantitative, the secret life of the attractor form is qualitative. How may we understand this? First of all, it's been observed that attractors yield repeating shapes of at least suggestive correspondence, as with a Rorschach: they seem to outline cognitively reminiscent patterns, as those of a cat or butterfly (commonly, the proximal windings or repetitions plotted through the perpen- dicular axes of an attractor-time/motion etc---generate a tom with brachiating appendages, like paddles or flippers elliptically rotating from the central self-similar \"lozenge\"). Though analyzable into a nonlinear ensemble of cycles, the aggregate repetitious pattern isn't that of cycle, sequence or periodicity in the temporally anticipated sense. The repetitions of the Form under consideration give descriptive limits, map behavioral extremes or defining parameters as which the manifestation of the form may be expected to respond while keeping the shape of its attractor. When first reviewing this non-ordinmy consideration of form (affective and qualitative, rather than strictly quantitative) we might well fear we're in the presence of some confused"},{"pageNumber":939,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV literalization of an abstract model or conveniently graphic representation, as if an aborigine might expect the quixotically \"butterfly\" tracing of a chaotic weathermap to lift off the chart with fluttering wings. We've discussed elsewhere, however, the way in which apparently graphic and purely spatial geometries may be expressed in serially tonal terms of rhythm, ratio and mnemonically organized harmony generating the perception of ordered unity through a temporaiized ecstusis. (Musical fifths and fourths are graphically equivalent to proportions of the logarithmic spiral.) These translative equivalencies should indicate that the involved rates, rhythms and proportions are purely noetic, i.e. they possess an abstract intelligible existence able to take form in variable ways and indeed composing the complementary states as which they're tangibly cognized. Viwl representation of such noetic or purely ideofonn values may claim orgarhiional kingship (since the grasp given by that means possesses an inclusive immediacy only retrieved by mnemonic synthesis across time-like orders of organization); yet it doesn't validate one mode as against another. Rather, the fact of that \"regency\" ought to show how the visible form bears continuous correspondence and relation of symbolic kinship to all the forms of organization as which its patterning ratios may be exploited. This is why the ancients, the alchemists and the spiritual scientists of yore perceived in the form of a \"lion\" not only the literal creature but a treasured natural librcny of formulae concealed in its dimensions, traits, physical harmonies and proportions giving the secret relationships linking space, time and Eternity. It is this to which Baron Verulam referred when exhorting in Novum Organum that the new scientific philosophers were mandated to determine the governing fonn of the thing so as to extract the essence through which all shared traits open the alchemical door of counterchange and transmutation; having not been understood on this single point regarding form, the Whole of the Vision held out for Science was fatefully distorted and interpretively reduced so that he may be blamed in some eyes for the subsequent objectification and estrangement of the modern era Cultivating Perceptual Fields With Share And Attractor Being in aposition to better understand what's meant by fonn, we may profitably identify the \"breathing\" pattern of the organhtional current emanated fiom thepsychic hypostasis through comparison with its analog attractor; the latter may be recognized as a recovery-through abstract reconstruction of variant, periodic behavioral ensembles--of some governing ideotype possessing immediately-visualizable representation. In this way we may ask ''what is a lion?\" and get a whole different perspective, with its characteristic constellation of answers, than was formerly permissible under aegis of differing criteria. We may find in the \"lion form\" the special type of an attractor, i.e. a tendency-of-being or ensemble of subset harmonics, proportions, cycles and ratios of coordinative distribution plotting a behavioral phase-space of preferential extremes marked by stable parameters over time. What's more, this \"lion\" necessarily encodes some certain existence-potentiality for the beholder (since all such complex attractor states arise as apprehensible form on the order of the anthropicprinciple, where one can \"know\" something only by its constitution of and as' some reflex of the \"knower\"). Therefore \"the lion\" is objectively real and is also the living symbol of a given range of one's own being-potential; this \"lion\" is not only constituted as an immediately-apprehensible"},{"pageNumber":940,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV presence through visual organization of an ideotype, but \"occurs\" in quiet form as a network of ratios, proportions and harmonics contributing periods and subcycles of one's own experienced life-processes, with its psycho-emotional ranges and alternative ex- tremes. The ancients were able to \"see\" creatural forms through immediate gestalts of stars, and across temporalized rhythms or objective cycles of the star- P-. Let's assume then, that the \"imagistic\" attractor gives sufficient schematic representation of a real Psychic form from which energic patterns of the corresponding Hypostasis emanate. If the \"butterfly\" should turn into a \"caterpillar\", or for that matter a \"cat\", there may be presumed a transformation in the character of the limit set (or convergence-locus) around which the rotations are plotted. The form of the psychic flow-pattern exhibiting the given extremes, maps out general- ized ratios of an internally self-similar harmonic. The form projects a network of coordinative properties, maintaining a dynamic configuration of variables as stable identity-pattern (i.e. an indefinitely enduring limit-congruence) through its typifying set of static variables, or parametric guidelines. Such static variables fix the form, and ensure its self-similar persistence amidst a nonlinear flux of uniquely aligned \"initial conditions\" (nonrepeating junctures of coordinative confluence, issuing through an unpredictable interaction of dynamic variables contributing n degrees of fieedom to the determining state). Static variables in the realm ofphysics may be identified as a magnitude like that of the Planck constant. Getting A Fix On Static Variables Ordinarily such a constant isn't considered an instance of a static variable belonging to a state attractor, simply because the context in which it's exploited hasn't had occasion to ask what it might be the variable oj. Its fixity and reliable constancy is taken for granted as a background value, and implicitly regulates the interactive properties of dynamic variables such as velocity and time, or energy and position (by the indeterminacy principle, the product in the measurement of complementary variables such as energy and time can't exceed the Planck constant). In the psychological realm, the presence of the \"static variable\" is approached across a comparative sampling such as that which identifies transcultural \"common denominators\" in the Jungian archetypes etc. In the realm of biophysical processes generating reliably-repetitious orders of percep tions, the static variable may be identified in the minimal cycle of em states underlying regulation of brain patterns, general synaptic discharge and myoneural measurements. Though examples of the \"static variable\" fkom such diverse domains give an impression of differing parametric types for different fields, the diversity is in the appearance. The same static variable which reproduces the Jungian archetype across cultures independent of time, place or"},{"pageNumber":941,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV conditions of diffusion, informs the constancy of neurochemical processes reproducing reliable images, identifiable sounds and tastes; and that same static variable accounts for the persisting value of the Planck constant. The stable parametric value of the governing fonn establishes the asymptotes (gravitating convergence loci) of the given system; The asymptotic \"pressure points\" of the Form give the defining borders beyond which the probabilistic approximations of participatory elements cannot cross, nor be in complete agreement without forsaking the goveming pattern and appearing in the presence of another order altogether. Such an asymptote is the value c for the physical system. It too is rarely considered as candidate for a static variable, since within the defining terms of the physical system it appears to be a \"constant\" without competition. Again, the question is seldom asked, of what could c be a variable? The value of the Heisenberg Indeterminacy principle itself is another such variable. (These \"different\" static variables--the Indeterminacy principle, Planck constant and lightspeed--are interlocked and refer to the same -biking, parametric texm or asymptotic limit-set.) The Colossus Of Cross-Rose At The Great Divide It is owing to asymptotic constancy of the static variable for the governing form, that a line may be drawn giving the limit shape of an attractor representative of a total life-pattern. Such a line is familiar to behavioral dynamics as the equilibrium trajectory or special limit set (usually assigned the value c). The special limit set may represent quantitative magnitudes such as the physical constants; but it may also represent the condition of psychic states-for as we've seen, a common \"static variable\" infonns the descriptively diverse parameters of physical, biochemical and psychological \"realities\". It may therefore function as the discontinuous dividing line between c and supraluminal velocities (4); but it may also signij5, qualitative distinctions, such as the discontinuous gap between conscious and subconscious states, waking and &earning etc. These quantitative and qualitative domains aren't that separate on the fkontier borders of physicsfpsychical research, since the mirror side of the asymptotic c divide is speculatively attributed to negentropic or synergic orders of organization ontologically as well as temporally \"preceding\", and influentially informing, the entropic field. Such a realm would be the shadow source of \"precognitions\", often rendered in the symbolically masking material of dreams anciently held to be Oracular. Due to the asymptotic constants (Pi, Phi, c, h etc.) holding the shape of the given field, stable definition is allowed the mirror counterpart reflected across the resultant equilibrium trajectory, or special limit set. The defining ratios established through regnant fixity of the form (with its characterizing \"static variables\") determine an order of inverse/compensatory ratios and complementary values across the asymptotic Divide. Such inverse ratios, on the \"mirror-negative\" side, comprise certain keys or relative \"solvents\" to the psycho-physical knots characterizing the delimited fixity of the \"familiar\" order (e.g., 3rd density focal-field). The locked-up interface Form, taken as a whole, gives the model of an overall Balance based on the prevailing integral degree in the allowable resolution of tenns for one side of the equation. That is, the established constants on our \"familiar\" side giving reliable properties and proportions of our taken-for-granted world, fix the limit of resolution amongst polarized operators belonging to the vanishing-point perspective of all positive-time asymptotes."},{"pageNumber":942,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The tendency is to identify exclusively with that \"side\" of the total system, for which there is no independent resolution or ultimate congruence of terms (the exclusive positive-time asymptote ensures such limit-for example, as the figurative ring-pass-not of c, keeping the polar terms infnite masshero mass eternally shy of their equivalence at infinity). This is why the locked-up interface Form of the total system, modeling mirror-compo- nent values of +A&At across the c divide or special limit set, may supply a type of provisionally \"resolving\" balance which the polarized tenns of a single side can't furnish on their own. Ordinary identity equations fix the whole-value of identity on one side of the Divisor (e.g. that of the positive-time asymptote). This is the manner in which everyone tends generally to be identified, at the 3rd density level. It's easy to see by this that the pons asinomm of the asymptote fixmishes the upper limit to any effort of resolution, or transcendent seif-congruence through the polarized factors of anisometric manifkstation in itself. The total, locked-up interface Form supplies a kind of compensating Symmetry which a single side alone necessarily lacks Unaccustomed as 3rd stage consciousness is to recognizing the fact, it does not belong exclusively to one side of the equation; rather, the mirroring sides of the asymptotic divide (defined by the static variable of a given Form) participate in, through and as afimction of the Whole-being value of consciousness. A single thought problem, perhaps in practice with its coupled exercise, will demonstrate the point. Dream-Snorkling Through The c Of Love (Navigating Negative-Time Nidrm) When for example we think of the s@ limit set (\"equilibrium trajectory\") as dividing conscious from subconscious or sleepldteamstates, we share a psychological analog of the discon- tinuous \"zero-infinity \" stasis of physics where we find allowable mass-existence below lightspeed and above lightspeed (tachyon etc.) but an unoccupied nomansland at lightspeed, across which neither positive-time nor negative-time energylmas may step. Simiiarly, we may enjoy waking cognitions \"above\" the asymptotic dividing line and dreaming cognitions \"below\" the asymptotic dividing line, but the precise moment of transition tiom one mode of being to the other seems chronically elusive. The passage fiom wake to dream or dream to wake seems similarly discontinu- ous, comprising a nomansland that appears consciously uncrossable. Yet we appear on either side of the border, 'hakbg up\" relatively speaking in diurnal life or dream-consciousness. If in practicing certain techniques such as \"yogic nidira\" where we Will to hold onto the transitional \"moment\", we're sure to cultivate, by-and-by, a certain facility in reminding ourselves to look where we've just been, so that the instant of the \"discontinuous\" transition-point is abbreviated and we may \"notice\" we've just emerged into dreaming conscious- ness fiom a lapsed moment of wakefulness, or conversely that we've just awakened fiom a nearby dreamstate still vividly clinging to the lids of dawning consciousness.

The polar extremes don't exist independently in the first place-waking states and dreaming states are modes of consciousness, and their exact equivalence with the commondenominator transitional medium is weal to begin with. In the same way, the conventional value c is distributed through an axis functionally equivalent to the obsewer-no matter that it has a finite value attached to it (e.g. 299,792 kps); everything falling along the null-line trajectory is self-congruent, non-separate, instantaneous and in£initely continuous. In itself it comprises an absolute (thus its function as asymptote, which everything may approach but nothing short of Itself may touch). Its limit-value is established only in coordinative relation to factors polarized through its resolving axis. Thus its given limit value is, as a constant, a static variable. And as we how, a static variable is a value set at a given \"time\", which may be changed. The Codependent Soul-mate With Which One Can't Be Satisfied Thus the mirror values facing across the border of the \"equilibrium trajectory\", estab- lished through governing constants of a given Form, furnish countercharged properties technically in balance with their polar counterparts. The \"anima\" of one's waking identity has an \"animus\" reflected toward it &om the dmmstak. The point-like processes of the em field distributed over collapsible probability-waves in positive spacetime, reflect across cancelling counterparts in nega- tive spacetime where their statistical \"deBroglie\" distribution turns out to be the non-statktical negatively entropic wavestate of a minoring, magneto-electric field; the centraking point locus of positive spacetime becomes invaginated, as it were, into the point-at-infinity of a counter-Euclidean space comprising the teleological growth-locus of an infinitely regressive orientation of envelopes whorled 'round its phantom \"Pascal line\" (given precisely as deBroglie-style distribution-patterns in positive spacetime). Yet these mirror modes exactly depend on one another for their properties. In that sense we may say their form-fitting counterpart cwatues are incidental, a function of the setting established through thefixedparameter or static variable. While it's true that the face of the anima presented in my dream corresponds by compensation to the \"animus\" descriptive of my chiseled psychic formations, it's thereby necessary to accept the counterpart countenance in its oneiric form regardless whether it dests as hoyden or harridan! Given the persistence of the fixed factors derived fiom static variables locking the familiar psychic Form in place, the accessible \"keys\" for resolving the problematic format are confined to counterparts generated in relation to weak integral values to begin with. If the index of integration is already low on one side of the equation, the minor ratios of the counter-values generated \"across the divide\" will be equivalently low, if oppositely charged. Th& my strategically-masculine animus is only given the \"ExCalibur\" of a solution from the mirroring lake of dream, extended on the arm of a mediocre Morgana. In the same way, the \"predictable\" forms of matter generated in the linear accelerator, or theoretically extrapolated according to the constants, mold their traits around the common point of departure or perspectival angle through which atomic behaviors display their \"familiar\" modes. The predicted Z appears as a 2, the W shows up as a W in conformance with the conventional contour-sketch in the curves and crevices of which they fit quite nicely.

A stylized behavioral \"cross-section\", it need be kept in mind, is an angular slice through a representative locus of contributory properties; while that \"slice\" bears a necessary relation to the whole which models it, it shouldn't be confused as a one-to-one correspondent of that whole. The reliable consistency of traits such patterning may present on its own behalf over a selective range, derives its high-wire confidence from just that necessary relation it bears to the whole; the blurred margins at which any closed cluster of traits begins to melt in inconsistency, are an equally necessary expression of the non-equivalence between the whole and that stylized self-representation (or cognitive grid-network) coordinately aligned out of its plenum potential. The energetic \"observer probe\" of micio-order distances obtaining amongst forces and fields, jw-popping a predictive bedlam of particles through Heisenberg rules of its own self-modi- fication, is based upon the ontological \"angle\" as which observer perspective actively integrates the coordinative matrix. The psychically focused \"angle\" sets the terms of the static variables. The implications of the coordinative angle fixed by the parametric constants carry through from known to unknown magnitudes, from \"close\" or behaviorally accessible domains to the projective vanishing-point of remote potentialities; and the \"unknown\" areas are obligingly contoured along one salient edge by the shapes of puzzle-pieces conforming to hightight features of the focal field. Angling Along The Right Track, But Tracking Along A Right-Angle Owing to the idea that every attribute is a stylized articulation of values patterned through endowment of the whole, every attribute--known and unlcnown-kars representative relation to that whole. Thus, as we've had occasion to note time and again, the existence of any attribute regardless the artifice of the projective pattern of which it's expression, isn't ultimately arbitrary but appears in a particular way, forming a necessary bond with its plenum ground. Since all possible attributes embody this same relation regardless their contingent correspondence with one another, a \"universalized\" means of resolving their (perspectivally contrastive) differences according to a coordinative \"common denominator\" may be found for any given field of focus. That Means, while reflecting their common and necessary relation to the whole, will always bear characteristic markings of the coordinative perspective through which the field is assembled. It will give the universal \"formula of resolution\", but in number values very characteristic of the particular field. Thus our physicists apply a standard of Symmetry to the orders of forces and fields \"found\" through selfconfiguring correspondence of the shared perspectival grid. And this standard is not simply a relative, contextual expression of the given perspectival locus without merit on other ground; it has universal value and finds applicability elsewhere, in other \"local\" frslmeworks, owing to its derivation (not from the conditional traits of any given field but) from the common relation between all stylistically-representative patterns and the whole from which they're wordinatively mixed. There are several implications involved here. First of all, the approach toward Unification taken by quantum physics, while employing a version of the universal symmetry map, makes use of that map only upon one essential \"plane\""},{"pageNumber":945,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV (regardless the number of additional \"dimensions\" they have to count in order to straighten chirality, integrate gravity etc.). That one plane is the \"given\", delimited field of focus still accepted according to naive realism as \"the world\". Regardless the number of added dimensions, the \"allowable\" plane of behaviors remains basically monochromatic, oriented in one (entropic) direction thus taking the order of spacetime itself as an underlying given against the background of which all forces and fields operate. Organization along the \"perpendicular\", for example on the axis longitudinal to spacetime, remains at least formally verboten on the slim excuse that it makes \"no sense\" or is meaningless relative to spacetimesrganized forces and fields (of course! that's why one must ask what new sort of \"sense\" such longitudinal influence would yield over-above the tautological expectations of the ordinary spacetime field). The unification Symmetry such physics expects to achieve through the particle accel- erator is, therefore, a chimera; though symmetry is a correct principle, the perspectival cross-section is being taken for the Whole so that the resultant \"symmetry\" of the cross-section will constantly leak, and betray the intrusion of hidden values emanating fiom that Whole which can 't be found in the self-displacing directionsfdentation. Force As Function Of The Field (Rather Than Feel As Function Of The 4s) Acceleration in the \"direction\" of the projected, monoplane unification scale can only amplify a hear energy toward logical implications extrapolatedfiom that linearity-it can only hasten toward its own self-frustrating pons asinorum, where all the mass in the universe would be needed to push the donkey of atomic positivism over the ultimately resistive precipice of its lightspeed limit. Configurational attributes of the posited \"supersymmetry partners\", generated in as- ymptotic approach toward the graelcup of the Planck constant, would only arise in the manner of the other symmetrized forces (e-g. the weak and strong force): as mirror co~tion of the perspectivally-held world of common electric charge, chemical valence thresholds, the experimental coupling constants, the phenomenon of Faraday screening etc. While it's true therefore that the expected \"supersymmetry\" partners (or some such structures) would exhibit the validity of the Symmetric principle, the application of that principle in the displaced direction of the identified monoplane remains simplistic (Penrose, for example, by applying \"homogeneity of the twistor function\" to an analysis of lightwave helicity interprets afundamental asymmetry for the given field of spacetime). In the same vein, the geometry of spacetime continues to be accepted as thefunction of interacting forces (thus linear acceleration bends spacetime, as gravitational mass, toward its upper limit); whereas the evidence of unification theory suggests another tack in relation to spacetime geometry ought to be considered more profitable, i.e. that which accepts the properties of forces, fields and the configurational dynamics of spacetime itself asfunctions of an underlying noesis4.e. an abstractly presiding geometric pattern accounting inclusively for the perspectival relations through which the unified field polarizes according to a coordinative scale, contrastively distributing its potential across the faceted model of a focal reflection-axis."},{"pageNumber":946,"pageContent":"MATRIX N Were these implications to be correctly accepted, modification of spacetime geometry toward various aims would be sought in another direction. Rather than bending entropic spacetime to its tightly-squeezed limit, the implicit symmetry distributed across the reflection axis would be invoked by other means (such transcen- dental symmetry includes the negentropic domains, of which the countersign \"supersymmetry partners\" are only shadow projection coaxed across the divide to the entropy zone through ambitious bending of the co-implied halves of the limit set equation, as when a metal strip is squeezed between the fingers so that a shadow of the upper part is cast over the lower part). Invoking of the implicit symmetry distributed across the reflection axis can be done by two mechanical means, one strictly technological and the other biophysical. Mass-Assembling The Energetic Coordinate Point This is possible due to a fact which we can now identify: the order of mindhody alignments through which the behavioral fields of spacetime are coordinatively projected, corre- spond to a goveming ideotype determining the prevailing polarization-phase and index of potential resolution for patterned terms of the cognitive domain. Those mind/body alignments, conforming to patterns of the governing ideotype, crystallize the static vananabIes as which the \"state attractor\" (giving fonn to the cognitive field) is held in place-thus functioning as guiding organizational matte of all subcycle syndromes, patterns of periodicity and self-similar recursion as well as establishing the behavior zones or allowable extremes contributing to the characteristic mindhdy state. Thus the very same cognitive/perceptual factors which serve to lock the value c and the Planck constant in place, align coordinative harmonics giving the governing degree of potential \"resolution \"forpsychic components of the 3rd density complex (i.e. the functional resistance-bar- riers between \"male\" and \"female\" charges, passivelactive ratios etc. Similarly, the Planck constant gives the coefficient of resistance in the process of quantum change.). The coordinative alignments establishing \"static variables\" locking the physical field in place, belong to the mindhody Axis perpendicular to the projective field. That coordinative axis enjoys a transdimensional relation to the stylized \"spacetime locus of cognition\". The specific fixating locus generated as product in the alignment of coordinate variables along the (transdimen- sional) axis, is known as the Coordinate Point. (This is the same as Castaneda's \"assemblage pointw--since Southern Crown has taught theoretical and practical knowledge of the coordinate point years before Castaneda's book first appeared discussing the identical subject of the Assern- blage Point, independent corroboration of the non-ordinary truth of both teachings may here be located.) Identical Nuclear Particles, And A Particularizing Nucleus Of Identity The strictly mechanical means of acquiring practical relation with the Symmetry of the reflection axis (special limit set) has to do with \"quantization of the observer\". This is a problem in state-vector theory explored by Von Neumann in the '40s. Quantidng-postponing general state-vector collapse through--observer perspective, involves integrating the observer into the"},{"pageNumber":947,"pageContent":"MATRIX N quantized system (i-e. an enclosed em field etc.). The energy-multiples obtained through plasmas, superconductors and caduceus coils have (secretly) already been proven to Solve for--or simply transcend--the problems involved in hear acceleration. The special properties educed through modified dimensional geometries of coils and conductors include that of arryons or identical-often fiactional-charges, the nature of which end-runs the Pauli \"exclusion principle\" for matter-parti- cles through variant subtotals on accelerated windings exponentially amplifying the energy-and thus, by proportional equivalency, the velocify-of a \"fixed\" field. Nonlinear energy-acceleration according to such altered dimensional geometry, differ- ently distributes the resultant mass; this is due in part to the identical character of anyons organizing the phase space of that mass. At a critical threshold of acceleration the indistinguishability of particles contributing to the sumsver amplitude of forces produces the effect of a virtual zrunslu- minal \"flash matrix\". The effect is similar to the phenomena pertaining to the closing angle of a shearwave or the rotation of the background starfield, except in those cases lightspeed isn't violated because the magnitudes are considered \"unreal\"; in the case of anyons however the quantities involved are real quantities, multiplying to real energy-magnitudes yet owing to their indistinguish- ability able to represent a spacelike separationdistance or distribution pattern beyond the linear limit of lightspeed to bridge. The subject of \"anyons\" is treated more extensively in \"What Is Physics?\". The second mechanical means of invoking the implicit Symmetry distributed across the reflection axis, that of the biophysical, affects a similar \"unlocking\" or modification of the static variable; rather than converging mutually accelerated magnitudes toward the Wh* locus of the spacetimeltimespace fields, the biophysical method modifies the mindhody coordinate alignments through which such static variables are initially locked in place. The simplest example of the biophysical method is \"yogic\" style breathing (see Charger Breathing section). It should be evident fiom this that the system of static variables as which the familiar world-dancing to the calls of the established constants-IS held in place, corresponds to the nuclear-lockin of the kundalini coil situated anatomically proximal to the perineum. Intermundorum So significant a principle is this, that is shall be resumed and expounded in the following section. A hint of its enlarged application (ranging from dilemmas of psychological and spiritual development to problems in physics) may in the meanwhile come fiom illustration of what's meant by the \"governing shape of the state attractor\", the ''prevailing integral degree\" in the allowable resolution of terms and the corresponding \"inverse ratios\" of the mirror-negative form given by shape and integral degree of the attractor. b Let's presume an attractor has a whole value of 10 emblemized by an unbroken bar; and suppose further that the ratios of ordering tendency it exhibits in the development of its phase-space yield a proportion two to eight, visualizable as a corresponding segmentation of the bar. In physics terms this may indicate the proportion of points tending toward the limit set of a basin attractor, and those tending toward the non-attractor of a separatrix; or the probability distribution in the overall systemic function of an equilibrium point as \"attractor\" or as \"vortex center\". In psychological terms it may represent the prevailing proportion in the operative ratio of malelfemale components"},{"pageNumber":948,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV for the given personalitycomplex (vividly analogous to the pairs attractor/non-utzractor, or attractor/vortex point). Were one looking for the balancing point between the proportional values, one could either slide the dividing line of the bar to symme&c center; or one could introduce a counterbal- ancing bar exactly divided by mirroring proportions. The former choice immediately modifies the type, implicitly changing the static vari- ables or parametric values of the total form thus renderkg a completely cliff-t (and inert, self-cancelling or non-evolutive) system. The latter choice establishes a kind of \"balance by artifice\", as when dream-images manufacture compensatory types mechanically imbued with the precise countercharge to waking identity-values. There is nothing intrinsically noble or \"spiritually essential\" to such types and such images. The dream material of anima and animus has no sacrosanct standard attached to it; it is all automatidcompensatory adjustment strictly gauged in relation to the prevailing arbitrary ratios in the \"daylight\" economy of the given psychic complex. Thus if the personality is manifesting an operative proportion of two-to-eight male to female values through the particular identity-equations, dream life will dredge spontaneous mirror manufactories disporting just the inverse ratio, usually to the chagrin of the one recovering the night's contents on rising. The latter choice thus gives the solution of \"balance\" in relation to factors as they are; it \"plays it where it lays\". The problem with the former choice is stasis; the problem of the latter is mtifce, as when a reprobate presumes to assuage the \"guilt complex\" masking his real psychic imbalance by doing austere (not to say absurd) penance for protracted periods, only to aggravate the unchanged urge of his postponed drives. Both \"solutions\" appeary in various forms, through the spiritual and philosophic traditions. The basic dilemma bred by both, has a definitive solution which also appears (less commonly, and usually in partial form) through certain other traditions. That solution is given in whole form, in the following section. Thus when a \"butterfly\" appears to psychic vision, in dream, trance, normal waking- consciousness or non-ordinary astral states, it doesn't signify merely the literalized \"stage\" in a cyclic process fiom larva to pupa to free-winged form; it constitutes a psychically resonant pattern modeling the limit-extensors of a given ontological potential within the life process, or range in the repertoire of available behaviors under the governing type. The proportions, resonances, subtones and harmonic relationships engendered as line and color, shape, motion or sound variably symbol-code for elemental energy currents modulating a recursive range of cognitions, styles and behaviors. A given \"state attractor\" or (astral) fonn tends to order a fixed field in the compound grid-network of apperceptive processes aligning a framework of focus. Eagles, ants and organelles, conifers and hedgehogs configure a common domain of Identity according to variant, coordinative proportions each yielding characteristic symbol-equa- tions in the resolution of elemental terms, while encoding the distribution of those terms in behaviorist subcycle patterns. The image of a \"butterfly\" or impression of a \"cat\" (e.g. in dreamlastral media) constitutes an intelligible whole pertaining to a specific focal field, in general the one familiar as"},{"pageNumber":949,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"material reality\". At the least, the reco-ble forms and images of dreamlife intelligibly clothe certain states and qualities in terms of the delimiting domain of known, waking circumscription; all such identifiable images constitute that specific waking range, make the latter what it is in terms of their symbolic proportions and subtone resonances'even though such qualitative hfkstmcture is subliminal relative to ordinary waking mind. Prevailing harmonics in the cycles and ratios of the given form (its value as an attractor coding information of extremes and means for coinvolved patterns or typal homologies), become telescoped into a kind of grid-filter imprint for the structural positioning of spatially correlated features tunning whole systems of cosmic congruencies into the symbol-silhouette of a \"solid\" creature or thing, reconstituted as such through the focal plane of waking cognitions. Thus a \"cat\" may encode a universe of shifting emotional nuance patterning storms and lightnings, stealthy currents curling into squalls whipping winds after their own tails and yet, when the dreamdust of its twinkling staramposition is wiped from the eyes of the waking state, it appears as the familiar furball tiny in its tiny comer in a world of typhoon enormity and dwarfing skyvault detatchrnent. Such projective structure, generating the given form through a web of coordinate linkages and coherently superposed types (thus integrating it through a process of regularized alternation and cyclicity) continues the function of the form in context of the temporalized and spatially apportioned world. It operates quietly as the qualitative pattern symbolically encoding a typifLing range of psychic apprehensions. Some such structures constitute intermediate forms (even in the context of waking consciousness), i.e. forms which straddle states and focal fields; certain forms comprise organiza- tional bridges between compound focal states, and thus between veritable worlds of cognition. It's for this reason \"shamans\" can be escorted by literal, physical birds, deer, mice and moths over threshold zones of regnant apperception into alternative domains-of-beiig. Animi Repetere Another common biophysical method of strictly mechanical character, is the related yogic-style format involving types of concentration. Concentration exercises, regardless their divergent features or the varying traditions from which they spring, all have as their essential aim the significant modification of pattern-coordinates holding the nod range of attention in place. Though the manner in which we perceive, think etc. is often taken for granted as the invariable \"given\" of unalterable physical structure, small application toward forms of concentra- tive exercise proves this a fid presumption; it soon becomes apparent that nod modes of perceptionkognition are habituated means for triangulating the required magnitude of attention. The way visual or auditory focus moves in and out of alignment with (mutually-invertible) impressions, the manner in which thoughts take form and discharge through consciousness or speech-patterns assemble themselves, becomes challenged as to exclusivity wherever the quotient of concentration informing such activity is volitionally altered. Whether attention is fixed on external or imaginary-internal object, repetition of a mantram or prayer, the subtle draw of breath through the nostrils etc. the altered type and degree of concentration required soon demonstrates its effect upon the habituated processes; it becomes progressively apparent that common rhythms of conscious thinking, the rates, cycles and subliminal waves compounding standard states of mind or sensible apperception represent characteristic but changeable ways of locking the cognitive pattern in place. Mechanical alteration of such flows and"},{"pageNumber":950,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV intensity-values through focal modulations of a regular type, gives swift intimation of the underly- ing--and unsuspected-reliance upon variable coordinative factors for persistent perception of \"the world we how\". The interdependence of all such processes linking cliches of the \"internal monologue\" with cliches of focal apperception etc., shows itself readily-enough in the way modified concentra- tion alters the breathing pattern and vice versa, or the way in which sustained fuzz-focus of the visual field disengages thought-process fiom the accustomed \"density\" and rate of its ordinary track locked into enforcement of the standard stereopsis, so that '%inking\" begins murmuring in a medium of variant viscosity. Virtually any such mechanical modification of the standard cogni- tivehiophysical modes will serve to prove the point and, with Mer practice, serve as well to induce alternative alignments of a sustained type suitable for a range of non-ordinary experience adjusted to a \"density\" of cognition varying from the norm (implicating a rosary of related reorientations in terms of conceptual integration, affective identity patterning and focal-coordinate alignments with respect to protean perceptual gestalts). Thus concentrative breathing, mental or sensory focus, sustained body posture or formal body movement have been at one time or another recommended as means of addressing the subtle factor of the \"fixed variable\" functioning as subliminallwordinative lock-in for the standard field of reference in order to nudge, budge or uproot it in favor of a more unitive mind-body potential. Virtually any means of mechanical m&cation through biophysical channels will serve the purpose--except the practice of modifying thought content. Content With The Form; Or Claiming Expense Taxis On The Zero-Two Form With No Visible Means Of Transport This may--should--come as a great surprise to all those accustomed to accepting teachings on \"positive thinking\" (whether of the Ernest Holrnes, Christian Science or Setb/Bashar variety) as existing on a par with the conventional repertoire of yogic and esoteric means. However, as we've suggested elsewhere (\"Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality\" etc.), the content of thought is precisely a secondary consequence of the standard lockin-pattern of focal adjustment to which we're inured by enculturation. That content reflects its variable, polarized range on a strictly horizontal plane. The extremes of its orientaiional alternatives are subliminally fixed and locked in place the way dynamic variables in a state attractor are governed and ultimately defined in their interactions by the quiet presidency offixed variables. The whole extent of the efficacy involved in standard thought content lies in the shift fiom \"negative\" to \"positive\" orientation. Such \"negativity\" or \"positivity\" necessarily functions, by inference, as a means of relatively rejecting or relatively accepting the modes of identification available through the determinants of the standard pattern. No amount of sffinnation will change that pattern itseK for the required phraseology in which any such -tion is embedded participates in the same rates, rhythms and reflexes of cognitive \"density\" holding the consensual order in place. Certainly one can verbally suggest-for example-- awakening in the dreamstate., but unless one has managed to modify the concentrative integrity through which such verbal \"decree\" is imparted (i.e., by smuggling it down through progressively subliminal strata of the murmuring mind poised on the brink of dream, where its coarse grammatical shell soaks and dissolves leaving"},{"pageNumber":951,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the non-verbal kernel of intent), its voice invariably discharges at the surface level without linkage to the coordinative means that might awaken the will it preempts. Such aflhative \"content\" is, in the effective case, merely used as the means of fixing intent through a convenient vehick-able to detahi its threshold coherency past the common point of dispersal-long enough to pass down corridors of consciousness toward regions where the vehicle is now quaint as an abandoned Electra by the side of the road, but where the conserved integrity of the intent may function as seed to impregnate the ground for more \"contemporary\" yield. Thus the \"voice\" initially addressing itselfthrough content of the verbal instruction-\"I am awake within the dream\"4s that of the matter-of-fact math professor of the daylight mind; yet the \"voice\" respondingly awakened within, at the &earning level, in self-efzexive upsurge out of the Intent conveyed by the quaint coach of that daylight persona, is more the muttering of the Mad Hatter than the reasonable oratory of a Carroll Dodson. The whole original \"content\" (the fustian professor \"ego\" clothed in characteristic verbal tweeds) may be viewed as the vehicular interpre- tation of a given form; such \"content\" having served the furthering of a kind of Intent implicitly transcendent to the governing form, necessarily keeps faith with the spirit of the Intent by holding its threshold integrity past the usual limit permitted by the form. In this way the whole original content (fustian professor clothed in verbal tweeds) effectively subordinates its guideline form to an overriding Intent requiring integraI modification of the fonn. Read slowly: Intent authorizes \"content\" to modifv that form in which' it's ordinarily conveyed, so as to transpose the intent successfully to the Other Side. Thus \"I am awake within the dream\" becomes a content, repre- sentative of the whole \"fustian professor ego of verbal clothing\", utilized in a non-ordinary way as concentrative vehicle maintaining the kernel of conscious coherence a bit ahead of its ordinary dispersal-limit into the dreamzone- serving as efficient instrument for mod~fing the fonn in which it was origrnally framed, as expression of an Intent reaching beyond its normative context (ordinarily acting to fix the form in place). Is the reader keeping this reeling Tarantella of content, context and intent perfectly straight as he &IPS empathetically toward sleep, perchance to &earn some ji-enzied personification of the principles? Therefore the whole original content (fustian professor of participial tweeds) functions according to a consciously-assumed Intent requiring modification of the very fonn permitting and holding together the initial content; the content-vehicle which starts its engine at one end in the person of the antiquarian prof. thus finds itself at the other End in fulfillment of its conveyed intent, not in the familiar shape of the Professor but as Alice bewilderingly confronting strange new contents integrated through a very different (dream) form. Why Hypnosis Flunks Its Subconsciousness Exams In the same way, \"non-ordinary\" effects apparently generated by content of the verbal command issued through a hypnotist are not ascribable to the literal value of the phrase alone but owe their efficacy to the modified medium in which the order is received. As we know, that medium is induced in the subject by a strictly mechanical means of concentration. The fact that, alone amongst the non-ordinary states of consciousness the hypnotic state shows no EEG modification thus suggesting it takes place at the level of or is most like ordinary waking consciousness, might recommend to superficial observation the sufficiency of thought content of the strictly ordinary type, in inducing non-ordinary modes. This \"fact\" is, however, not as extraordhmy as it may first appear; more than anything, it demonstrates the insuffciency of EEG monitoring in accounting for--or registering4e range"},{"pageNumber":952,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of variables actually involved in questions of consciousness states. While EEG patterns indicate relative functional emphasis through the vertical distribution of gnomon strata (Beta corresponding to predominant cortical activity, Alpha to midbrain dominance, Theta and Delta to the deeper dream-and-sleep states of the medullary centers ad brainstem etc.), they fail to discriminate a type of horizonral shift in functional ratios-ofemphasis between left and right brain hemispheres when unaccompanied by corresponding \"descent\" (or downward retraction) through the brain-mind layers. Such a shift is hallmark of the hypnotic state, in which right-brain gestaltism is made to prevail through concentrative modification (fixed focus on a metronome motion, monotonous repetition of instruction) thus deemphasizing left-brain linearity, subjectlobject dichotomization and related means of abstract distancing, separative self-enclosure etc. The \"dreaming\" mind isn't just a function of one set of lobes, or the expression of a specific mind/brain locus such as the medullary. It is a compound condition, and one of its indqmsable components is the hemispheric emphasis of the right-brain. The condition ordinarily apprehended as \"dreaming\" takes place through basal brain lobes in a recession of the \"cortical storm\" down the brainstem, and proportional activation of the right hemisphere as fixed-focus linear emphasis of the left brain (ordinarily dominant in daylight identity pattern) correspondingly disperses. However, a dream-like condition of hypersuggestibility may be enstated without the subject succumbing to actual sleep and dream, in the proportional shift of hemispheric emphasis to the right-brain without concomitant slippage of cortical activity in recession toward the medullary lobes. This dreamlike condition is properly known as hypnosis. It is a modification of the consciousness-states induced by purely mechanical means. Verbal content is strictlysecondary, a way of directing attention, and has no transfw- mative value in or by itself-witness the numbers of people in any sufficiently large sampling who simply do not take the verbal directive as a concentrative injunction; without the respondent concentration, the verbal command by itself is perfectly ineffective. (Castaneda's \"heightened awareness\" is a type of hyper-suggestible hypnagogy induced by repolarized bio-magnetic align- ments. Traditional tribal cultures, oriented with proportional emphasis on right-brain patterning processes, exist normally in \"hypnagogic\" state accounting for the charmed fluidity and haunted psychic resonance of the identity-profile, merging indistinguishably through totem and fetish etc.) Reality-Creation As Interior Decorating (Or, I mink If You Put The Lamp In The Opposite Corner We Won't See The Mouseholes, Therefore IAm Certain We Won't Need A Floorlength Curtain) While it's true that any form of verbal affirmation, positive thinking etc. has apotential for concentrative induction, the ordinary flow of the induced \"concentration\" is--constitution- ally-& the standard direction. The Sahi of the concentrative arrow will certainly take the intent embedded in the preferred thought-content and run with it; therefore change can be--and is- wrought through regular return of the attention to protracted dwelling on a given idea, mood, feeling, desire or concept. It is for this reason we routinely deny only the efficacy of such prescribed means for"},{"pageNumber":953,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV transforming the total context, away fiom the hework in which such content continues to fix the range of experience without being properly identified as a variable system of rules rather than iron-bound laws. Indeed we've implicitly relied on this characteristic of the nature-current to nourish, coax and unfold the plenum seed potential engraved through the pattern of a given thought imbued with a sufficiency ofbasic Identity-value (thus in our above experiment in \"reality-creating\" we suggested effort be expended only on those goals or objects in which one really had some identity-investment). Therefore it's always possible to change the arrangement of one's psychic \"furniture\" within the total (implicitly set) context. One may change orientation fiom negative \"denials\" to positive \"affirmations\" and, with consistency and persistence realize an accurate reflection of such change in the types and qualities of experience magnetized to one's personal purview. (This is hardly the revolutionary idea or major metaphysical breakthrough as which it's touted by its acolytes, whose enthusiasm for the \"new\" notion only identifies them as beginners in the work of true spiritual transformation-helpful perhaps to other beginners a few cobblestones back on the turnoff road toward Oz, but scarcely consequential otherwise. The magnitude of attention perennially paid them is only index of the chronic condition of \"beginner\" characterizing a majority of incarnative souls.) One may, theoretically, through a pure form of the model, fill a sad empty house with bright ornaments, a bustling family, two cars in a builton garage and pets for every family member, yet the tacit background context of \"the house\" remains. Changing the charge on content fiom negative to positive succeeds in vibrating the preferred meaning as a potentiated intent across the threads of implicated force belonging to the nature-current; thus the dull finish on the familiar surface may acquire a lustrous patina, the bleak may become comparatively shiny. In the ideal case, every kind of positive inflection for a given set of conditions may be realized-dssuming the \"affirma- tions\" drawn up for the occasion aren't the repressiveprotestatio~~~ of a severe complex (as they usually are) in which case a peculiar admixture of positively-anticipated results and subliminally dreaded consequences appears as the realistic product What inevitably remains intact and grossly unnoticed regardless the relative \"purity\" of the result is the governing set of coordinate variables, firing the field wherein all such conventional content discharges as \"my\" identity-pattern unthink- ably rich in codomable verisimilitude of a self-confirming type. Preserved untouched through all such -on are the habituated mindhdy align- ments, focusing and locking in place the total fiamework wherein such content may be considered at all meaningful or central to the identity-pattern in the first place. The whole range of content fiom which one necessarily extracts the matter of the affirmations, remains held in hypnotic thrall by such persistingthabituated alignments; the whole range of content is only a fiurction of that configurational form. If we ask where the meanings come jFom with which that (comfortably familiar) content is imbued in the first place, we'd have to see such meanings convey only tautological sense as consequential expressions of the relative form conserved through mind/body alignments around the static variable. The subtlety of the variable is such that the fiamework as a whole is chronically taken as a constant. Thus the only \"movement\" conventionally contemplated is a movement that takes place between the allowable extremes of the \"given\" context, the cognitive field \"we know\". We only accept our viable options as transpiring within the house, in the manner of one who's born and lives his life in a single domicile so long he can't imagine what it would be like elsewhere, nor can he contemplate any prospect of moving (except fiom room to room). The limit of \"positive"},{"pageNumber":954,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV thinking\", \"personal reality-creation\" and the list of afkmtions should now be more apparent. We may decree \"I deserve a happy family life\", \"a thriving business\", \"a summer vacation home and another Ferrari\" ad infiniturn: and, should we succeed through such afhnations in proportion- ately quelling the comsponding doubt, the padlei undercurrent of guilt etc. we may \"impress\" the Sakii of our personal energy configuration sufficiently to enlist the nature-current at large in a concerted direction magnetically attmting the necessary elements of our aim. The entire underlying structure through which \"I\", \"deserve\", \"family life\", \"summer vacation home\" etc. derive any meaning at all, isn't however effected or touched but to the contrary only enforced, subiiminally reaffirmed and its particular \"stock\" heartily invested-in once more without question. The underlying structure of current processes and mind/body coordinate alignments whereby an \"I\" is strategically nucleated over-against a field of potential \"others\" challenging the temporalized integrity of that \"I\", remains unquestioned, is never touched, persists as the governing mechanism through which such intentions acquire any meaningfulness at all, underwrites and reinforces all the activity organized about such intents and is reinforced in turn by the resultant response-patterns conformably reiterating--and inferentially endorsing-its bracketing premises. You're Enlightened If You Think \"IAm\" (Or, There's One Born Every Minute) We may imagine some such afEmation as \"I am enlightened\", \"I am at perfect peace with myself ', \"I am identified universally and am in complete harmony with the cosmos\" ... but we must at least muse in passing why such simple methodology was never recommended by, say, the Buddha..Perhaps he simply didn't have the counsel of Ernest Holrnes (one always wants to write John Holmes, for some reason). After all, as opposed to the merely mechanical means recommended above for shifting alignments with respect to the \"static variable\", the network of aflimations possesses a real content charged with meaning, and isn't meaning, we ask, the fundamental value by which the psyche is engaged in the first place? Why the ostensible \"superior virtue\" in a set of exercises which, being purely mechanical, seem utterly lacking in the central nourishment of meaning otherwise able to effectively enlistthat other commodity identified as indispensably valuable, i.e. the value of Identity itself? In answer we need merely note that the above-hypothetical~tions, veritably bristling with easily-identifiable meanings, nonetheless enshrine all the standard orientations and implicit conventions governed by mind/body alignments through the \"static variable\" (locked-in coil of the kundalini nucleus, for those who prefer Eastern mystic nomenclature rather than Western science-ese). Certainly these afhnations refer to states posited as intrinsically outside or beyond the normative context; such states can be concepruaIized within the standard framework. Yet the Sakti of the nature-current is very \"faithful\"--as we've had occasion to mention before-& its role as the Dog fetching its master's newspaper; it will only retrieve the familiar paper, the one written in the same language as that employed to issue the command. The master may effect a changeup in the content of the command, \"authorizing\" the Sakti to fetch a neighbor's paper written in Farsi; but the target meaning of the intoned content isn't selectively significant to the Sakti as it may be"},{"pageNumber":955,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV - to us. The retrieving Dog listens to the infection in the voice, the style of the command, takes its cue from the overall implications embedded in the sentence-structure and phraseology, for it's shy of strict meaning-specific orientations in it- self. Rather, it recognizes the JW meaning as belonging to the form which serves to structure and impart special resonance to the content to begin with. Thus the Saki is always actually responding to the total form subliminally serving to shape the context of the meaning-content, when it moves to bring a mirror correspondence of our reigning mind configuration. In that sense it's quite punctilious; it is strict in a blindly-faith- fid but subtile way regarding implicated nests of meaning informing the target content of the \"pre- ferred\" thought or feeling. It acts on implicit meanings within our motives about which we'd generally rather not know. At the very least (i-e. simplifiing- away all the practical psychological tangle actu- ally carried in a given idea or \"affirmation\") we may say that Saki necessarily acts on all the subtle infrastructure if typoZogica1 meaning encoded in the content, so the range of implication involved in locked-in assumptions of \"me\" and \"you\", \"self' and \"other\", \"subject\" and \"object\" gets embroidered just as readily and even more consistently by the current-considering how much less ambiguous are such primary presumptions relative to their secondary psychological twists. Therefore if, given the ideal case, I should \"succeed\" through my affirmations in realizing my \"identity with the cosmos\", my nature as \"always already enlightened\" etc., such \"success\" can only come in the form familiar to the context. It can only come back as exemplifi- cation of the precise cognitive phraseology (with its implicitfied variable) that authorized it. Thus \"my\" enlightenment will not be Enlightenment, my \"identity with the cosmos\" will not be Identity with the Cosmos but some self-representation of the idea caving forward all \"my\" implicit and unresolved ontological assumptions: it may be served up to me by the Saki of conventional monetary reward, the glorifLing respect of my peers, the sudden consistency of success in finding a parkingspace (even in downtown Los Angeles) ... but all such reflections of the initial intent remain conditional manifestations of that whole subset of presumptions coded into the command; they'll invariably bear the mark of the informing-unresolved dualisms and polarized tensions indicative of the standard lockin range through which \"thought\" manufactures the meaninghl contents-in-ques- tion to begin with.

Don't Board The Beamship Without A Complete Change Of Under-Ware Of the several mechanical means here mentioned of making a true qualitative shzp to a more innately-unitive coordinate alignment (through modification of the static variable), it must be submitted that the least satisfactory and most dangerous is that of the purely technological, as described by arrangements of coils and conductors actually shifting the geometry of the operative phase space. This is the \"Merkaba\" mode of the so-called flying saucer vehicle, the \"time machine\" etc. It is least satisfactory for the simple reason it forcibly induces a coordinative unlocking of biophysical elements, through the exclusively material polarity of the mind/body form, resulting in the subject's being propelled into novel mind/body realignments in conjunction with alternative psycho-physical patterns having no necessary or organic correspondence to willed changes in cognitive orientation. This is a haphazard method of unlocking, disturbing or completely unsettling the timecoordinates of the personality, the biomagnetic keys and current patterns organizing the effective cognitive \"space\" of the being so that the psyche is or can be alarmingly dislocated (cf. the ill-fated Philadelphia Experiment etc.). Even where the shifts are induced under greater technological control so that the psyche isn't overtly disturbed, the lack of organic correspondence between the objective-mechanical means of poiarkation and the induced realignments in the subject's own system persists as an undesirable factor. Unlike the biophysical mechanisms of breathing and concentration etc., in the case of strictly technological means there's been no preparatory ground in the practiced alignment of the unlocked \"lower\" (vital-physical and etheric) centers, with the amplified energy-potentials of the higher (psycho-emotional) centers. This means in effect there's no accustomed, quietly awaiting pattern of harmoniously- integral elements prepared to greet the unleashed magnitudes of energy and psychic charge in the transitional chaos of confluent realities. The real danger doesn't lie so much in disintegrative disruption of the mind~body vehicles, as in the unaccustomed openness to empty potentials of the cognitive form; where no wholesome/integrated alignment through coordinative adjustments along the cerebrospinal axis has taken place, the psyche so recently accustomed to+bituated-deflection in overall orientation through vital-physical centers now finds itselfin abruptpassive orientation to the deeper magnitudes of its own being with which it has little-to-no formal practice, or history of volitional (and thus organic) acclimatization. In effect, it blindly confronts dimensions of its own cerebrospinal axis which are technically empty or unused owing to lack of practiced alignment through organiclbio- physical means. These exposed, empty dimensions of the Will (cerebrospinal axis or, multidimen-"},{"pageNumber":957,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV sionally, the susumna) constitute magnitudes of potential relative to which the psyche is as yet quite passive. Indeed its only \"conception\" of these greater conative dimensions now comes in the bewildering fom of changing m.nd/body states, modified apperceptions and feelings, all relatively incoherent except through Procrustean interpretation of the carryover cognitive format Where the psyche is essentially passive to such exposed dimensions of its own volitional \"track\" (no longer insulated by the biophysical barrier or filtrate energy-net of the ordinary \"Earth grid\"), it is inordinately vulnerable to the usurpation of that volitional instrument by forms of intelligence consciously functioning in-and-through those denserhicher states. In the \"higher\" densities of mind/body alignment the distinction between individuated smmnas is not so pronounced and the barriers not so intensified by exaggerated forms of cognitive polarization. This state of affairs may be fine when the imposed Influence is imparted from Positive Zones of higherdimensional alignment; but it is not-so-fine when the imposition is effected from zones of the negative hierarchy (see \"Channeling, UFOs And The PositiveMegative Realms Beyond This World I, 11 and III\"); and, according to the modifling modality in question, it is most likely in this technological case to emanate fiom the latter rather than the former, since potentiation through (and fiom the direction of) the vital-physical centers is the characterizing methodology of the Negative being. Again, we may refer to the (true) case of the Philadelphia ExperimentMontauk Project and in particular the strange case histories of the Cameron Brothers, for a telling example. The general concept prevailing here is: \"ifyou don't know where you're going in this vehicle, we 'II tell you\". Apostases From The Seats Of Learning; Or, How The Streams Of East And West Split North And South The above concepts shouldn't be entirely foreign to those who're familiar with several classic yogic injunctions against \"dehiscing\" the energetic pod of the susumna-and-centers from the bottom up, without concomitant 'adjustment from practiced contemplation through agency of the \"higher\" centers. Such injunctions may be considered informal rules for the inexistent \"instruction booklet\" on the mind/body form; they refer to the principle that the obedient behavior of the Sakti-current invariably magdies, and multiplies many times the various implications of, whatever objectsf-focus the flow of attention may turn it toward. The \"higher centers\", led by the Ajna or Third Eye, encompass and serve to regulate the \"lower centers\" according to the more holistic valuessf-being in much the manner that-physically--the pituitary gland is denominated \"master\" of the endoqine system and serves to regulate hormonal metabolisms of the extended complex. Where the order of concentrative opening begins through the tan tien or abdominal zone of the vertical centers, which technically is a kind of accumulator for subtle energies, the danger of disproportionate amplification relative to psycho-somatic properties of those centers is correspond- ingly enlarged and submits an additional degree of difficulty to the total equation. Although this methodology is quite characteristic of the greater Oriental tradition apart fiom the Hindu cultures, classic Buddhism and Taoist philosophies incorporate mitigating modes of moral observation, forms of insight-meditation and a simple surfeit of vital responsibilities (a preemptive methodology not to be under-credited!) in controlled irrigation of progressively-higher"},{"pageNumber":958,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV centers from burgeoning aqueducts of the lower. Derivation of the various martial arts practices from meditative modes of the Oriental Temples (Shaolin etc.) is well known. And, whereas proper conduct of martial arts training is obliged to incorporate all cautions and spiritual injunctiok springing fkom the hermitage source, it's also common knowledge that, where the basic object of the esoteric practice shifts and swells in its own right to a sufficient raison d 2h.e the danger enlarges that the point of the original practice will be obscured along with the injunctions. Thus the Oriental schools of \"mysticism\" including branches of the Martial arts, taoist and buddhist forms of \"magic\" etc. tend to align in order of technical \"vulnerability\" with the Western traditions of the Mystery School, similarly ushering the spiritual aspirant through the introductory door decorated with sigillae of the (more accessible) vital drives. The original object in each case is to secure spiritual success the more thoroughly and completely by engaging the aspirant at the magnetically-intensified zone of his immediate concerns, enlist his energy and attention hm the familiar point of view so as not to discouragingly exhaust them in grappling with abstractions for which he has as yet no similar enthusiasm or rapport. Bottoms Up: On Rite Use For The Cup Of The Mystery Scole Time and again in the history of these traditions we find the initial spiritually-oriented schools splitting, branching into subdivided and often competitive \"lodges\" or b'temples'y, many of the offshoots based on a reordering of priorities featuring some intermediate or secondary objective of the Parent school as the chief goal (install'-, as it were, some strictly local deity in the place of presiding god). In the case of the latter, these branch streams of the basic spiritual tradition may be influenced in their autonomous drive by invisible (extradimensional) blandishments of the Negative hierarchy, sometimes overtly as when the hubris of the self-installed new-order hierophant is addressed My by subtle voice instructions hm \"offstage\", sometimes covertly as when such would-be hierophant awakens from dream without exact memory but with \"a good idea\". It is under such (historically repeating) circumstances that traditional streams of instruction bifurcate and diverse into myriad branchlets each purportedly representing the root tradition, some faiW to the inspiriting ideal but some most certainly of differing dedication to a diverted goal, i.e. martial supremacy for its own sake, magical hegemony over the elements and over man himself etc. In the latter case the specialized emphasis on lower-abdominal concentration, vital- physical energy accumulation and accompanying instinctual enhancements characteristic of the originating school within a transcendental mework, becomes \"streamlined\" as the exclusive province of strictly mechanical techniques, the complex of common motivations indicative of every neophyte being by inference preserved intact (so that, as the powers associated with the hara in itself become progressively enhanced the corresponding \"mental\" polarity of the basal brainlobes- reptilian hindbrain-becomes proportionately enflamed in its characteristic enthusiasms without mitigation or modification). Naturally, since the \"antidote\" to such contretemps depends in the final analysis on the sincerity and acumen of the student, even those technically \"positive\" schools of the spiritual traditions, East and West, may randomly produce a solid candidate for the negative hierarchy--this is inevitable, given large-enough volume, and simply \"comes with the tenitory \" here and elsewhere."},{"pageNumber":959,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV This is, after all, how such schools and traditions manage to manufacture the embarrassment of competitive hierophancies in the first place. This is how legitimate and spiritually oriented martial arts schools may spawn individual or group autonomies lighting out in the \"dark\" direction on their own. Though it's not common knowledge at the popular level, given a sufEciently high competency or technical degree of initiation in the martial arts there intercedes a phenomenon well known at such deeper levels, wherein the practitioner-regardless the \"style\", positive or negative orientation of school etc.4~ petitioned by the type of insistent \"off-stage\" or subtle voices alluded to above, enticing toward what in the Star Wars saga would be termed the \"dark side of the force\". At this stage should the practitioner affect to resist such blandishments, a negative envelope of reversed fortunes and downtumed circumstances seems mysteriously visited upon him until such time as he succumbs ... or, until such time as he finds the means on thepositive side of the coin for overthrowing the factor within himself allowing the continued attachment to his person of that \"negative presence\". This latter eventually constitutes a higher initiation of its own, and may be considered equivalent to a \"crossing of the abyss\", transcending the \"dweller on the threshold\" etc. in counterpart Western traditions. That's Why They're Called ''The Heavies\" In the same way, the Western Masonic, Qabalistic, Rosicrucian and Templar initiatory schools (et al.) have acquired a kind of overall \"negative\" reputation with certain \"conservative\"- largely, fundamentalist Christian-critics, a reputation which has a quaint basis in fact wildly distorted by commentators influenced by said mossback element. The \"basis in fact\" is this: given the general point-ofentq or chosen orientation of the Western traditions (dating back at least to ancient Egypt), there arises the same initial introductory dwelling on forces and processes corresponding to the lower-abdominal centers. (In the case of the Western Mystery schools this has been, until very recently historically-speaking, an inferential rather than direct concentrative emphasis; such schools largely mediate the activation of such centers through use of corresponding symbols, thus seeking to ''sublime\" the impact of their awakening with psychidnoetic keys.) As a consequence, the same potential for deviation in approximately the same proportion characterizes the profile of these mystery schools, as was shown to be indicative of the Eastern taoidmartial arts orders. Therefore we have the typical bifurcations of Scottish Rites Masonry and British Free . . Masonry, the Rosicrucianism of the Marhmks and the Rosicrucianism of the Golden Dawn, and innumerable variations or purported representations of the DemolayA'emplar tradition In the case of some such variants and autonomous branches, the founders and followers certainly took the \"cue\" fiom amplified vital-physical tendencies unmitigated by loftier motives or more perdurable stand- ards, heeding the blandishments of negative internal whispers without skipping a beat and so orienting their (deepest and most secret) motives toward a strict securing of temporal power. These latter thus become dedicated to physical wealth, political, social and economic supremacy and even a kind of controlling metaphysical ascendancy over all \"uninitiates\". Owing to the respective qualities adhering to the resultant, bifurcated orientations of these mystery schools (often bearing the very same name, remember), it is inevitably the negatively- inflected branch which leaves its mark, deposits a camouflaged but nonetheless evidential trail owing to the gross physicality of its overall aim and orientation; by contrast, those schools which"},{"pageNumber":960,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV preserve their positive spiritual inflection intact, seldom leave gross evidence of their existence or clues to the Business about which they labor, of a type liable to fall within the fhmework-of-atten- tion of any uninitiate public, simply because such schools conduct the dominant portion of their real work on the subtle planes to begin with, take their aims and goals in those planes, deposit their light \"marks\" in those planes alone and leave it entirely up to the potential ripeness of the real spiritual candidate to locate the address of their unadorned physical Door. Thus the only version of the perennial Traditions which attracts any publicity at all, tends to be the one working most deeply in the material medium (shared with the public as the only realm the latter knows). The sole activity of those sources detectable beneath the political-economic camouflage, is necessarily that of the Negative tradition-for the tread of the Positive is so light and gentle in its inward progress that it tends to leave no impression at all for edification of the gross senses. In this way it's almost assuredly the activity of the negative mystery-school branches which our \"fundamentally\" dedicated protagonists detect when they declaim upon the \"godless-satanic\" character of those Mve factoti behind the notorious Ordo Seclo rum... since such fuadamentalist minds are only able to deploy the detection equipment of the gross senses to begin with. Although, as MT has always volunteered to commend, such fundamentalist watchdogs are often actually more acute in detecting the catspaw presence of the Antagonist than their \"occultist\" counterpart, for the accelerated paranoia of the former always acts as psychically-sensitive geigercounter unerring (and spookily-uncanny) in upturning authentic clues completely overlooked by the allegedly \"trained\" eyes of the initiate. (How many initiates, subscribing to the so-called positive orientation, are aware of the camouflaged Tree-of-Life presence in the commissioned painting adorning the wall of the U.N. \"meditation room\"?) Initiation Machines Of The Negative Hierarchy (Or, Are You Sure This Is The Holiday Inn?) It becomes easier to see how the strictly technological alteration of the \"static variable\" belonging to mind/body coordi- nates locking the physical world in place (e-g. through scalar electromagnetics, ambient field propulsion and other proposed \"saucer\" modes), would tend to serve a predilection toward negative polarization-alignments. The inevitable induction of vital changes in the chakra-coordinates through biophysical coupling to the electrostatic field, exerts its transiting impact most directly on the lower centers mediating vital processes of the being in themselves (the remaining chakras along the vertical axis, while uniformly vital-etheric within the given hework, mediate successively \"astraI\" and \"mental\" zones of the mind/body form). In this way the vital-abdominal and corresponding medullary regions are magnified in intensity and sum influence over the remaining structures, exacerbated in the attractive power belonging to the given \"identity investment\" of the 3rd stage personality-complex, and imbued"},{"pageNumber":961,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV with de facto unitive hegemony in aligning all faculties and forces toward themselves. In the normal 3rd density mind/body structure there is inevitably instituted a practical polarization \"top to bottom\" as an orientational stream of deferential reference so that the \"superior\" cerebral and abstract-cortical faculties k placed in implicit service of the psycho-emo- tional (limbic) system and both are deferred toward serving vital-abdominal drives or coded survivalist patterns of the hindbrain, in this highly amplified case the orientational tendency becomes \"absolutized\" owing to the superior power of volitional control imparted by mechanical means to the virtual void-locus opening of the hara, or abdominal tan tien. The additional \"degrees of Mom\" introduced by the symmetrizing effect on the vital-physical geometries (allowing a multidimensional convergence-alignment and amplification through such facultative coordinates) enters the \"orrlmary\" personality structure into a preemptive condition of chaos resulting-practi- cally--in a bewildering superposition of familiar and unfamiliar, fantastical and \"normative\" states (cf. the report of the Cameron Brothers hm the Philadelphia Experiment-despite the objection of detractors who don't know any better, these are true accounts insofar as the heightened] memories of the siblings serve). Yet it's precisely this chaotiduusettling condition which signals uncoupling of the multidimensional mind/bocly alignments orienting the void-locus coordinate point, fiom normative ktion through the ideoform \"static variable\" (maintaining hypnagogic constancy of the Planck scale, Einsteinian lightspeed etc.); it's precisely the threshold domain of this condition which signals concentrated reorientation of vital-etheric coordinates through inten- sified congruence along the cerebrospinal void-axis, so that the volitional factor is especially awakened, denuded and faced in the specific direction of (chaotically magnified) abdominal potentials. As we've noted above, the actual \"emptiness\" of that axis through the higher centers (necessarily unpracticed in volitional activity from such levels), plays into the hands of higher-di- mensional intelligences already practiced in the occupation of grades corresponding to that very space; given the subtle imposition of such Influence, and a hyper-potentiated aptitude for exercising extraordinary volitional control relative to vital-physical programs and survivalist-oriented patterns of the hahindbrain complex, there's imparted virtually-irresistible momentum in the direction of aggravated self-aggrandizement, aspiration toward metaphysical power brokerage--and thus, veritable enslavement after-the-fact to the blandishments of Negative-hierarchy control. It's for this reason that invisiblelextradimensional as well as corporeaYemissary repre- sentation of the Negative Hierarchy continuously encourages strict technological advancement through manipulation of Earth-based military and scientific orientations; under the premise of furnishing what such personality-structures want in terms of personal and professional advance- ment, hegemony in the power-race, control over refkctory factors of the natural and social order etc., the Negative hierarchy promotes the exploration and manufaca~e of what is in general saucer technology, i.e. the dominant type of technology characterizing development in their own higher- density worlds. The reason for this now becomes apparent: the \"saucer\" isn't what it appears on the surface. It isn't just an advanced means of getting hm \"here to there\" in space andor time; it isn't simply a superior way of out-maneuvering the aerodynamic competition. Properly understood, the \"flying saucer\" with its electrostatic modification of biophysical and vital-etheric field alignments, is an Initiation Machine of the Negative Hierarchy. The aspiring pilot or passenger (or abductee) steps foot in such a vehicle for what appears to be an empyrean cruise, and is instead subjected--all"},{"pageNumber":962,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV unknowingly, in most cases40 an authentic initiatic mindhody repolarization-alignment necQ- sarily emphasizing, by virtue of siructural requirements of the purely technological approach, a negatively-directed current polarizationj-om the higher cerebdchakra centers and volitional axis in deferential service-orientation toward the vital&stinctual, power-and-survivalist centers. The fact that such initiations do not \"take\" in all cases, is tribute to some spiritual-psychic development on the part of the given personality which inhibits complete \"succumbing\" (and which, in certain cases, may even serve to \"redirect\" the amplified power-potential). Before the reader finds anything too glamorous or perversely \"attractive\" about this sort of initiation (technological induction is so much swifter and simpler, you know), let it be noted that in the majority of cases a true conscription to the negative hierarchy is not expected or anticipated by the Negative perpetrators, who look on all such \"candidates\" in any case as contemptibly beneath them; rather the \"initiate\" is exposed to such vital amplification/modulation more in the spirit of fattening-the-calf than in the sense of \"readying for higherdimensional Glory\". The additional vital-physical reserves generated through the pram vehicle are simply vampirized; minions of the negative hierarchy \"potentiate\" the vital reserves of the subject only so the subject may be de-vitalized through psychic or biochemical extraction of hormonal energyes- sence. It's necessary to note here that not all \"saucers\" are of the strictly negative variety. There are counterparts at certain levels of the positive hierarchy (cf. Positiv~egative Realms etc.); in such cases however we emphatically point to and take agreement with the Ra material on the subject: saucers of the positive hie~ar~hy are seldom seen, almost never participate in those scenarios known as Close Encounters (either of first, second, third or fourth variety) and become progressively \"tangible\" to certain subjects (only those with a real background affinity for same) as a natural correlative of the subject's independent spiritual development Posit-ion Tells Where You Are, But Negat-ion Tells Who You Are Another important factor need be noted here as well; in the purely technological form of changeup in the state attractor for the system as a whole, nuclear potentials are directly and mechanically modified by cancellation of sum-over forces around the scalar moment (as in the superposition of identical phase-dislocated em waves); this permits an artificial \"pumping\" of gravity-potentials and mechanical alteration of alignments in the nucleus. Such technological \"bypassing\" of delimiting (vectorial) valence-potentials of the shell, allows a kind of direct bench-engineering of magneto-gravitic and electro-static states; it opens a remarkable energy-latitude virtually at the discretion of arbitrary mental decisions. But there is just the problem. This is a basically \"inorganic\" way of coupling to longitudinal phase-states allowing \"verboten\" motions transverse to ordinary em signal propagation (i-e. in the direction of lateral time movement, either forward or back in time). As with aU such deracinated mind-meddling in Mother Nature's Works, this availability merely magnifies the potential for throwing innumerable- and now muitidimensional!-things arbitrarily off: By contrast, the biophysical means of mechani- cally modieing the static variable through realignments of the coordinative Locus (i.e. through practices of breathing, posture, concentration etc.) display the distinct virtue of approaching the"},{"pageNumber":963,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV problem \"organically\". Where persistence in practice leads to success, such purely mechanical but organic means succeeds just as well in modifiing nuclear alignments, potentiating variable biogravitic and em organizations etc. but with the additional virtue of having done so with at least minimum coordinative agreement amongst the related parts of the actual whole. Rather than promoting a simple extension of the piecemeal approach already preached by the fiagmentism of conventional science, the biophysical model of mindhody modification relies at least minimdy on the organic wisdom of the whole. And it does so not by bpassing the vectorial valence-mechanism of the electron bond, but through enhancing the effectiveness of its action. Just as the technological means necessarily relies quite strongly on positive-ionization in plasmas etc. so as to emte direct nuclear engagement, the counterpart biophysical means conversely relies on magnified negative-ionization potentials through the somatic system. As we've described elsewhere (Charger Breathing etc.) negative-ionization is associated with strong oxygenation of the system; this is accomplished through changing the proportion of C02 to 0, in the bloodstream, and may be done either through amplified breathing or by way of certain concentrative methods. Negative-ionization is classically associated with enhanced vitality and alertness; the weather-patterns and climatic atmospheres tending to promote it, are coveted. Briefly reviewing what we've described more completely elsewhere, negative-ionization increases the overall/available information pattern of the system. This is due to the additional orbital electrons comprising the \"anion\" (\"anion\" is negative-charged particle; don't confuse it with \"anyon\", which is identical particle). As Charon has suggested, the \"electron\" is only a point-particle to experimental limits; in fact the compass of its organic exchange-patterns suggests it has, or acts as medium of, negentropic properties. We suggest it conforms more to Eddington 's \"locus\" made up of superposed magnetic moments; by Einsteii structural calculations for the quantum shell, it might be considered to conform topologically to a magnetically braided toroidal attractor-state with vanish- ingly small \"navel\", corresponding to Charon's singularity with event horizon specifying a dimensional-thresholdlthrough-the-loo- for phase-conjugate properties. Across that threshold, virtual photonic exchange operations \"tunneling\" amongst space-like separated particles would continuously take place with no information-loss due to conservation limits of the singularity. The Moebius-twist belonging to this (dimensional) right-angle across the electron space would bring all such synergic information-patterning into direct alignment with the atomic nucleus, fiom the \"inside-out\" as it were; the interior of the nucleus would thus be identified as continuous, through a dimensional perpendicularity, with the \"outside\" space structuring the electron shell having its coherently superposed waves exactly coinciding with orbital multiples of e. All the phase-conjugate (and thus time-reversed, negentropic) properties of the electron infktmcture space would then be recognized as contributing vital information-coding to the strong-and-weak forces governing nuclear composition~alignment. Enhanced negative-ionization (as with Charger Breathing etc.) would self-evidently serve as exponential amplifier of such organic information potential. The non-ordinary amplification of information exchange may then serve, in Lavoisier manner, to promote biomolecular transfor- mations through modified nuclear relationships corresponding to truly gestalt patterning processes, producing far-reaching potential for molecular combinations and advanced biochemical structures largely unknown (at the normative level) but constituting electrolytic/hormonal keys for higher dimensional mind-body alignments (coded for cognitive, perceptual, behavioral and somatic"},{"pageNumber":964,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV chauges in the overall system). These changes draw of course on the inbuilt, pre-coded wisdom potential of the total mind-body being. They're not induced through rootless caprice of the manipulative mind left to its bare technological devices. Indeed we may desdbe the nature-intelligent organization of some higher dimensional phase space, in the lattice-bonding of molecular ions generating topologically the type of self-cancelling em grids denuding the purely scalar moment in the case of Bearden's pulsed magnetic vectors. In the case of the organic molecule, information patterns of a holistic and far-reaching type coded across ion bonds and communicated directly through the resultant mag- neto-gravitic potentials of the \"exposed\" scalar state space, would serve to catalyze extensive realignments of a morphogenic and multidimensional order completely beyond the grasp of mechanically-induced means taking their effective point-of-departure from idiosyncratic menral priorities alone. The superiority of the organic model is every way evident. Two Basic steps, With A Right-Angle Turn Between Them (Or, Why You Can't Just March Up The Staircase Of Spiritual Accomplishment With Your Eyes Shut) Drawing on the wisdom of the most complete and altogether cogent spiritual traditions, it must be recognized as well that the biophysidorganic model of mechanical transformation is in itself inadequate for authentic Realization It constitutes a step; it is usually given as a preliminary step whereby the necessary mechanical modifications of the mind/body form may be made, enabling nonordinary availability of cognitive potentials through willed changes in the \"static variable\" (i-e. modification of the contributive patterns giving triangulation-values of the Coordinate Point, which sets typal limits for the hmework of focus, sensory-motor orientations etc.). Therefore a certain minimum success in the biophysidmechanical aspects of the Work, makes possible a magnifica- tion of the overall potential readily available for the Greater Step of conscious reorientation. Such conscious reorientation requires an intelligent inquiry of the being into fundamental values of existence; it may be summed in the &vana abstraction: \"Who Am I?\" Since such a question-mecessa~ily-has meaning for the ordinary state of mind as well, the mistake may easily be made that such inquiry can be successfully conducted at the nonnative level. That level, however, is chronically inadequate for the sustained degree of intensity or quotient of concentrative fixity needed to obtain the requisite perdurable value indicated by the place-of- honor assigned such Inquiry. The ordinary level of chronic physical focus globally presumed as \"the real world\", has already locked-in the limit of resolution for the complementary terms of cognition before the fact. In order to infensz%i, overall potential for the quotient of resolution, the contributive components of that lock-in must be modified. This is the proper place for what we identify here as thefirst step: biophysical practices of a purely mechanical type such as exercises of breathing and concentration etc. In order for coordinates fidng the range of perception and cognition to shift so as to alter the pot&ial quotient of resolution for cognitive faculties, the very rates and rhythms of thought to which those faculties are chronically coupled must be modified. This corresponds to the stage in Buddhism known as absorption, in Patanjali yogi as stilling the \"modifications of the thinking principle\", in Alchemy as \"fixation of the volatile\". Such targeted equilibration in the fluxes of chronic thought-patterns (to which all forms"},{"pageNumber":965,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of perception and cognition are mechanically adjusted) imparts the requisite stilling of the interior monologue enabling awareness to address the implicit question-of-being more directly, without discursive mediation of the ordinary conceptual processes. This is still an expression of the purely mechanical part of the practice, and buddhism (for ;hstance) recognizes that a very conscious and volitional investigation of the total Ground must ultimately be conducted. Tbis brings us to a less known or understood dimension of the Practice, one in which the tendency of the thinking process to persist is allowed and accommodated as legitimate self-endowed means of engaging the fundamental Inqujl. Thus it is possible to have a clarified form of awareness and to engage the thinking faculty in ongoing Insight into the ultimate character of being; what's mandatory in relation to awareness and the thinking process is not some permanent \"extinction\" of the necessary modes of either, but a modification of the implicit \"static variable\" or fixed coordinate reference (and its related typology) setting the normative limit of Resolution for both. Thus, 'Wdcixg\" must continue in accompaniment of an intensified form of awareness, but through a medium of cognition coordinatively aligned in such a way as to furnish a densedricher field of potentiated Being-value. In this way rhythms, rates and overall patterns of the thinking process become harmo- nized to a threshold degree of potential resolution, below the Initiatic minimum of which no such Insight-resolution may be accomplished (owing to the indigenous turbidity of the prevailing medium). In a true state of overall value-intensification induced through biophysicaVmechanica1 practices of the first step, thinking may take its point of departure fiom a critically different quality-of-being, as expression of the informing factor of Identity largely relieved of the discursive pattern-formations of preferential identi~nghdentrrcation. Free fiom serving strictly as a function of identi~cation, thinking is allowed to serve the whole-being value of Identity more directly. The very state in which thinking discharges, then necessarily returns a decisively different quality; rather than forming impressions restricted to flat, one-sided surface values parading linearly through the monologous circuit (for instance), the process of thinking now tends to exhibit a type of translucency whereby the obverse and complement of every polarized impression spontaneously gives itself to the overall item of cognition. Think@ then thinks through things rather than toward or on the surface of things. In this way awareness and volition are furnished an optimized medium for authentically-penetrating insight. (The domain of the pun, visual or verbal, gives light expression to the connotative bleed-through facility imparted by processes of cognitive intensification, and often laces even the casual communication of adepti as a jocular--if disconcert- ing--type of \"zen-pointing\". Finnegans Wake is a master's thesis on the genre, and charac- teristically assays to join that generator-of-groans to the most ecstatically comprehensive insight/overview on Being.) Such insight comprises the distinct second step of spiritual development, a step which is necessarily discriminated fiom the mechanical approach of the first and proceeds by an altogether different means. Ordinarily the two steps are improperly telescoped into one, the second being confused with features of the first which seem manifestations of intensified awareness but are in fact contingent reflections of changed coordinates not necessarily allied to volitional value at all."},{"pageNumber":966,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1V Part v Our description of the Hypostatic Currents is here resumed; the whole precedingsection was devoted in a sense to the Psychic Hypostasis alone, while the remaining Supernal Hypostases are summed in a paragraph each.

It accounts for the worlds and their planes, properties and powers as Self-expressions of an ejective overjZow imparting influential pressure to each successive density-potential, the next geared to move fiom modulations of the informing field in accordance with its own requirements. Thus the Light of Noesis reflects on the general hypothesis of matter-limit, as through an antinomic medium keeping coeternal company with Its gnostic value; and It's reflected in that medium as a type of ideoform unity burgeoning with abstract implications, the seeds of which push toward the gestatory power of reflective Light as the irrepressible patterning tendency of Mind. In turn the living configuration as which the current-atmosphere of Mind breathes out the reflective holohedry of the world pattern, possesses overflow pressure of a unitive intensity sufficient to awaken the matter-field (degree of resistance limitation) correlative with the \"angle\" of Psyche. In tun, the currents of the three Hypostases serve to influence, organize and regulate characteristic cycles of the compound vital-etheric stream through which the fdtrate order of the physical structure is perceived. Thus the \"physical world\" is in itself a reflected format of the nature-current without"},{"pageNumber":967,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"indigenous\" inhabitant. The conscious Hypostases (Identity, Mind and Psyche) align indirectly, in conjunction with loci of the vital-etheric current, through processes of identification adapting the ideotype by preferential affinity for the leisurelyflinear examinations unique to that field. As we've seen, the vital-etheric current hamits values belonging to the Hypostases, through an organizational axis which may be considered \"mutually perpendicular\" to all three. The (horiz0ntal)plane of that axis descriptively constitutes the physical field; and it has been illustrated above how lights of the Hypostases, appropriately modified at each level by the nature current of their corresponding Worlds, reflect through one another and into the vital-etheric field imparting formative influence for successive \"nests\" in the organization of phase space potential landscaping the configurative grid-network. Rather than thinking in terms of derivative patterns already locked into place at removed levels of focus (e.g. the physical atom and molecule, biochemical nerve networks etc.) body-intel- ligence must accustom itself to the sensitive presence of a weblike hfhstructure of folded space with an elemental life of its own, and tending to gestalt organization of every \"far flung\" force as non-local collaboration upon the universal gyre identifiable-through its own stylized fonnat-as DNA. The gradations differentiating \"type\" and patterning process of matter in this multidi- mensional field witness to the hegemony of consciousness, as resultants of the Hypostases aligning through and resolving at discrete levels. The Currents And Their Corresponding Systems: Working For The corporate ~hble While Reporting To The Department Supervisor Thus the fiery aspect of the vital current represents the phase of direct receival for impressions of the presiding typology, reflected fiom light geometries composing atmospheres of the \"approaching\" Hypostases. The fluid-airy phase of the current interprets the presiding typology as lineafonn networks of allowable connectivity, linkages for variable modelings of the plenum \"field geometry\". The fluid-watery phase of the vital current catalyzes the affinities coded into the geometrized state space; and the solid-earthy phase of the current settles into place the resultant, static variables for the coordinative grid lock-up fbmg the field of focus as a stylizedkubtractive topology of perspectival modeling (rendering all the familiar perceptual qualities, reconstructive evidences of submicroscopic \"vector-fields\" and behavioral parameters etc.). These elemental current processes of the vital-etheric field, each reflecting some aspect value of the Hypostases and together compounding the focal state of \"matter\", correspond as we have seen to integral systems of the stylized physical pattern. Each such system is \"operated\" by its correlative breathcurrent, through the multidimensional convergence loci of the chakas (physically interpreted as the plexuses and related ganglia). The radiant-fiery current corresponds to the nerve-networks and overall \"generative\" system; the fluid-airy current corresponds to the respiratory system; the fluid-watery current corresponds to the circulatory system; and the solid-earthy current corresponds to the digestive system. What we \"know\" of each system is, of course, its composite stylized appearance through interpretive mediation of the cognitive grid-network (configured by the breathcurrents collec-"},{"pageNumber":968,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV tively). Thus while they appear to coexist on the same physical plane, each functions through and mediates the value of a discrete \"dimension\" in the etheric patterning process. For example, while the generative system represents the glandular processes and nerve-networks coding vital informa- tion of the biochbcal being, what we \"see\" of it 'is a stylized rendering aligned through all four systems and currents chieflfinctioning in and through the radiant current-state of the etheric field. Its principal purpose is that of \"interpreting\" the governing ideowe as a key for the preferential alignrnent/regulation of nested state potentials configuring the etheric current-field. (We perceive through the resultant alignment; fields and energies do not exist as we perceive them. According to our epistemological pro&, however, neither do such properties bear no necessary relation to values of which we can have knowledge, or with which we can share an intuitive understanding--since the most \"fanciful\" perceptual demesne springs from a rigorous ontological uniformity.) It should be kept in mind that, when consulting our epochal table of classifications ahead, the physical organs, processes or systems cited in conjunction with a correlative \"breathcurrent\" of the vitavetheric field come to us ''already\" as a reflective composite of the currents Me functioning as evidential emissary of a specific stream. Each such lobe or system represents its correlative current through the composite field, so tbat while--for example--the prefkontal cortex exhibits functional correspondence to the ideoform character of its radiant-fiery current (as a focus for symbolic, conceptual, abstract and anticipatory thinking etc.), it assembles categorical service for the fluid-watery current under which it's cited since it sits at the end of a sequence receiving organizational work from the striate cortex and limbic systems. Conscious And Subconscious Channels- Enweaving The Thought-thread While the composite activity of the (multidimensional) breathcurrents weaves the centers and systems paralleling what we perceive as the physiological processes en masse, those processes are worked through two principal agencies, that of the nature-field and that of the consciousness-axis. Thus the composite activity of the breath-currents serves to coordinate, align and preferentially assemble the correlated \"sheaths\" mapping the network of autonomic nervous systems as a whole; and, while remaining in itselfa function of the sub-conscious nature processes only indirectly related to noetic light values of the conscious Hypostases, serves just the same to configure the collective vehicle of those hypostases in the form of the cerebrospinal axis or conscious nerve-networks. We may imagine this most easily as the Sakti of the nature current constructing, out of its own densely rich and versatile substance, a vertical tube with \"portals\" for the convenient billeting of the conscious hypostases \"on their way through\". Across the coordinative portals of that axial tube, the hypostases shine light of the informing ideotype from their respective \"angles\", producing a convergent ray in adaptation of the ideotype to a stylized configuration reflecting in and through the streams of Sakti-current (preferentially highlighting the angles and confluences of their courses). The resultant pattern of highlight properties defines a grid-network of processes feeding an overall, cognitive function (we say \"feeding\" advisedly, since such metabolic work is the chief business of the structuring current). The thinking, perceiving and range of cognitive behaviors characteristic of the resultant pattern (the physical world \"we know\") are identified expressions of the informing ideotype. As"},{"pageNumber":969,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV products of the conscious hypostases focused through the \"physical field\", they represent modes of knowing coordinatively organized across the subtlelsubliminal \"pivot\" of the void-variable. The current processes through which their self-consistent grid alignments are ordered, are themselves polarized expressions of a unitive void field; that cruiial void-factor itself, however, is only available to the self-reflexive faculty as its unique expressor, so that the fulcrum of change alone able to enforce or to modify the ideotype remains out of range of the nature-field in itself, belonging exclusively to the Conscious axis. The active thinking and behaviors issued is expressions of the ideotype, are necessarily generated through responsive agencies of the coordinative Sakti-current (aligning field geometries in servo-mechanical reflection of the typological \"angle\" given through identity values of the consciousness-axis). Thus the patterns of thinking, feeling, doing and perceiving are continuous issue as energy-events of the Sakti current. Mind-body processes organize and encode around the qualities represented through such meaning typologies; activation in thought or behavior lights up the extendedfield as a configurative modification tending, by intensity, to map reality in the image of the thought. Thoughts and feelings of sufficient intensity or coherence do not merely pass through the nature-field as a flicker of transient distortion (i.e. as a \"contrail\" in the aura, or an electrified jet streaming into the magnetic ambience). Such feelings or such thoughts, especially when expressed as speech or behavior, or surcharged with prolonged brooding, represent the sum coordinative activity of the Salcti current holonomically \"personifi.ing\" the thought as a charac- teristic, configurative code of the field-geometry through which it operates. It concentrates the code of that geometry to an intensified seed-presence, ultimately sowing the general field as a range of formative potential reflective of the cultivated value and curving all parallel potentialinseminated through the general ambience--in conformance with itself, to the degree of its organizational unity; or conversely, deforming into alignment with some similar patch of energy-potential possessing higher quotient of ordering influence. In this way the mindlbody processes of the autonomic grid network, comprise the coordinative sakti pattern expressive of the informing ideotype; the field of perception is ordered and aligned through this elaborative network in accordance with values of the type. Magical Mirror Magnetism And The World \"Out There\"; What's In It, For \"Me\" Then what of the extended field itself? Is it the great questionmark, the unknown eternally inapprehensible save through some modeling mode akin to the a priori \"categories\"? The field fiom which conformal perceptual alignments are elicited (as if such objects existed in themselves, \"out there\") represents the extended density-potentials displaced around the concen?ratedpleroma itself, constantly sown-like an ontological garden-with thought-seeds impressed from patterns of the mind/body grid. Such seeds are always germinating, according to factors of coordinative timing, into bushy magnetic sprouts of pullulating potential progressively enlaced through an abstract identity-network carrying forward the signature identi~cation of the conscious axis, twining 'round the mesh of magnetic couriers and correspondents forward'ig all other such signatures thereby ordering, through non-local medium of the enfolded state space, a complex of fecundated hows related by affinity to value requirements of the inseminating thought.

The blue-green in the feather of a parrot; the iridescence in a midnight rainpuddle bouncing points of reflected neon; the diamond splash ofjetty-reef or waterfall., the rust and dun-gray tangle of a junkyard, or the flicker of fireflies in atwilight orchard--every quality, hue or cognizable form serves to symbolize and objectively reflect the nuance in a thought, the range of tones and tendencies embedded in every available feeling or conceivable idea on the pemonal and collective scale; and all the types of experience, the cachet of events and sigillae of circumstance incorporating those display-values of the peacock world, render the narrative of all that's contained, denoted or connoted in the available range of thoughts personal and collective. We may characterize this magical-mirror process as \"magnetic\", without subscribing to secondary or derivative models as of the electrician's field, or imputing to the general ambience some petitio principii begging the question as to how such ambience may be known \"in itself', apart fiom a givenlstylized grid enforcing the manner of its interception. As an extension of the density-potentials through which the common denominator pleroma of the mindhdy axis cosmi- cally projects, it may be said that everything intuitively available for the Being of the one is potentially available to the cognate being of the other. The \"magnetic\" quality imparted, by the given thought seed, to the field through which its sown (and finally harvested) as reflective experience yielding the wealth of encoded potential, is minimally descriptive of a value of identity. Even em events of the physical field may be productively understood and reinterpreted in this way. When we think of the generation of \"magnetism\" or production of \"magnetic lines\", we are referring to the type of a parallelism in behg and behavior that's essentially repetitious, self-reproducing, eidetically enforcing of itself, classically self-similar and tending toward confor- mal alignment of everything with it. The \"magnetism\" we may recognize as flowing through the general field, is expressive projection and elaboration of the value of Identity as it implicitly tests its \"self\" hypotheses in propagation over nmnels, cross-courses and snaking convolutions of the seething ground. The alignments, modifications and cancellations amongst occelated signature- prints compounding self-echoing waves of the overall field, are indices of the average strength or intensity of the respective identity patterns. We may \"see\" these things more directly by a yogic art of inwardness; but even this \"seeing\" is the product of an interpretive instrumentation (the atankarana) generating all such visions as representative signature and symbol according to crosscut stylizations of a coordinative perspective. Any such inward witnessing takes place as through a \"veil\", no matter how compara- tively refined and accommodatingly gauzy. The decisive name of what's beheld is, in any case, no more the obliged product of such witnessing as it is of any physical or gross-sensory approximation. The intuitive (and immediate) identity-of-correspondence between the \"witness\" and anything at all of which it may be the witness, is sole grounds for understanding and accurately identifying the nature of what's \"known\"."},{"pageNumber":971,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Since We Just Knew You'd Ask: Straightening Out The Lightning-Flash Of Fohat The Light operating through vehicle of the conscious axis, is that of Fohat. The tern Fohat in theosophy has come interchangeably to mean the creative light of Dhyans Chohans (angelic intelligences, certain forerunners of Man) and the kundalini-sakti or serpentine electric force known to yoga as the encoiled nature-intelligence situated proximal to the perineum. In this context, we identifjl Fohat as the principal Noetic Light lent the Conscious Hypostases fiom that Light of Infinite (the \"more than Luminous Darkness\") in which all beings and events preexist a fullness beyond discrimination or non-discrimination of qualities. Fohat has been identified first of all as the mysterious principle mediating mind and matter; the \"mystery\" of this mediation has been given ample description in the \"Mother Terasu\" essays, especially Part 11 of \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness'?\" Here we characterize it as the chief vehicle of consciousness-matter, as distinguished fiom nature-matter (as we'll see, the reflective light of nature-matter contoured according to the noetic properties shown through it by Straightlight of cosmic Fohat, operates the vehicle of the autonomic system in the mind/body form). Light of Fohat is identifiable as the Self-luminous instrument of Logos, or abstraction in the formulated Means whereby Infinite and its allowable finitude are to be \"reconciled\". It is the unitive Light reflected without intervening \"instant\" fiom the homogenous sameness of Idkite, which, in its abstraction of that unity fiom fullprior inclusion of all satisfied selves fhtefully reduces the state of Being fiom the value of Absolute so that \"resolution with the finite\" comes in the form of an open proposition projected to be realized4us its emanative behavior, issuing the fields in which such resolution is to be \"civilly discussed\" and at the same time formulating the contrastive grounds through which the terms of finitude may be conceded essential requirements of their own quality thereby magically potentiating unqualified Absolute with a kind of (ultimate) enrichment It couldn't claim according to the strict preexistence of Its progeny. (Indeed in this way Absolute shows itself to be Absolute, e.g. by eliciting qualities and conditions out of its all-accommodative amplitude it \"ought not\" to be able owing to strictly definitional standards establishing the candidacy for Absolute: \"eternal prior satisfaction\", \"completion without lack\", \"puissance that can suffer no infhity within its nature\" etc.) Fohat is the vehicular presence of Clear Light, itself without modification and claiming no conditional quality as first reflection of Infinite, while transmitting--at the same time-all the ideoform unity bearing upon Infinite in constitutional aspiration after an expressive field \"of its own\". Such ideofonn unity represents the essential manner in which ''things\" abide through infinite; by abstracting the ideoform unityfiom Infinite--holding it up to the Light as a transparent value with its own independent legitimacy apart fiom the general Satisfaction of its identity, at Infinity, with Absolute-that finitizing quality may be reflected through Fohat as the abstract proposition of finitude/delimitation toward the resistive Point-limit (thetically comprising the granular \"irritation\" at the heart of infinity enduing the point-of-departure for conditional existents, that opportunistically reifies with the exclusionary abstraction of Clear Light fiom the absolute- ground-of-being so as to contrastively offset the generalized principle of \"matter\", or circumscribed Akashic Space fiom which the ocean of Infinity apparently recedes). In this way Clear Light (the noetic Self-luminance of Fohat) reflects the principle of"},{"pageNumber":972,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV ideoform abstractionfiom its abidance in Absolute, conveying it as the Idea-proposition of a Satisfactory Form secreted around the permitted suggestion of the point-limit at Infinity, and toward the fateful state of Limitation-in-itself comprising the impenetrable pons of resistance to the dissolving all-accommodation of Absolute--like a creation mound or islet of self-isolation under withdrawal fkom the Surrounding Sea. Fohat, or the Logoic vehicle of Clear Light, reflects the Idea-typology of a holistic pattern predicated on the proposition of iinitude, and fashioned in such a Way as to comprise a promissory grounds for integrating the specific Existent of finitude with the general Well-being of Infinite. Understanding this, it becomes clearer what the creative Sakti actually is; in contrast to the provisional definitions furnished by theosophy in a haste to bring broad concepts of virtually- unknown things to a greater mass of humanity, we recognize a subtle distinction between Fohat--as the \"mysterious mediator between mind and matterw--and the nature-intelligence or cosmic vital-matter of the Sakti. Knowing the consternation such variant use of the term is liable to cause those theosophists who 've struggled long and hard already in mastery of the conventional definition, we may move to placate the disturbance somewhat by noting the formulaic nature of the term so the divergent usages may come down to a matter of which phase of the formula is being employed It may be noted that Fohat can be rendered QabalasticalIy in two signijkant ways, each of which gives internal testimony as to its particular use. IfFohat is rendered FWMlT with the \"t \" as Teth (see \"Motto-in-the-Lotto '3 its value is 3 1.3 1 being equivalent to AL or LA both ofwhich may sign13 vog nothing or non-being while AL refers to divinity, we may say this phase of the formula suggests the SC usage: the presence of HAD or the point locus in its mi& indicates incorporation of the preexistent potential for limit (\"Had\" means '7imit\" in Persian) as luminous-ideoform seed or Logoic Type of a Resolving Pattern having elaborated the thesis of restntnction and resistive inertia (or opacity) into the abstract sum of the seed-type but not in itseIfactuating thatpotentiaI+--In itself it remains lucid (void), clear light of the Divine. It is equivalent to Thought in the most un$c and whole-being sense. Rendering Fohat as FYHAT with the '2\" as Tav, we get the value 418 which is the numerical equivalent of Abrahadabra, the Word of the Aeon or Logoic formula--as such it is the manifsting, 'konjuring\" or magickal phase of the term whereby all the limit-potential of existence comes into being. In this phase it may be understood in the conventional theosophical sense; the Manifestation of Akasha is--by theosophy-Fohat or divine Energy. On the different planes-so explain the texts--it 's known as aether, air, fire, water, electricity, ether, prana, Ahha as the Astral Light, Universal Soul, Matrix of the Universe, the Mysterium Magicum, Prakriti, sea offire, atomic matter,fiely serpent, evil serpent, pregenetic matter, divine thought or energy (Sakti) as manifsted on any plane of the cosmos, the interplay between Spirit and matter, the Shakti of Adi, Anupadaka, Atma, Buddhi, Mental, Astral and Physical (Ether). The Daleth of the HAD in thefirst term is 'ffolded under': absorbed or masked (the ideal point locus of being is invisible and non-manifested in the manvest field, just as Egyptian architecture based itselfon the dimensionality of volume rather than on the thetic-nondimensional poinr). \"Daleth\" signifies \"oar\" as entrance-point or locus of a creative cornucopia. That entrance-point is concealed in the Manifstation, and on& 'kzppears\" through its coordinative representations in the relative field. The Tav of the 418 formula indicates the Manifsted or volumetric-representational center, just as a cross (T-cross, e.g.) extentis an implicit \"center\""},{"pageNumber":973,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV elementally through the cardinal coordinates. This latter, manifesting phase of the formula (Abrahadabra) shall continue in all SC texts to be called Sakti according to traditional usage; theosophy equates Fohat and SaRti in the latter sense, while we prefer to distinguish Fohat fiom Sakti in the sense of the first numerical formula, 31, therebyjkmishing an idenhifiable term for the ideoform light in itself; ontologically prior to its reflection ofthe 4th stage of resktance-limit wherein it renders the reflex geometric coordinate-fields of Sakri. Fohat conforms to Straightlight, otherwise known as Light of Straightline (Rwh, Spirit-being in Qabala) while Sakti and kundalini-sakti correspond to Nephesh, (nature-soul or vital being, Sephiroh of Circles in Qabala). Why We Don't Fall For The Fall Sakti is itself the plenum patterning potential dzflactedfiom the resistance-limit ofAkarh under unitive Light of Straightline (Volitional Void-value of the conscious Hypostases). That Light superposes a preferential format of \"shape integrals\" implicit in the reflected ideotype, upon the plenum potential of the patterning phase-space. According to the degree or given value-index of the ideotype, the patterning processes of Sakti conformally align to abstract impressions superposed across its plenum field-ppressing operative potentials not immediately indicated by the func- tional degree or value-index of the ideotype, and angularly highlighting those operators which correspond. Interestingly, this simple analysis shows two important things, relevant to the Resolution of perennial \"problems\" of cosmogony, theodicy etc. (which are no better \"answered\" by channeled or self-invited flying-saucer voices than they have been by the historical roster of inept earthly officiants). First of all we see that this \"reflective\" apparatus is interpretable in tern of a kind of \"fall\", whereby the ideoform passage of a governing Light through progressively displaced and distorted values of a patterning geometry encourages the reciprocal occluding of that Light so as to further modify the magnitudes efective2y available through the ideotype. At the same time, we should be able to see fiom the description that there is--and can be--no actual \"fall\" at all. The apparent distortion in the Sakti-current or nature pattern as it accepts and further molds the available range of its informing Light, is simply the function of relative perspectival angle (superposed by coordinative keys of focal alignment projected from available magnitudes of the ideotype). The state of the vital-soul or Nephesh remains global throughout, with only variable elements of its Sakri-components provisionally \"recessed\" or steeped in shadow. In effect it is the Volitional Light of Straightline (Ruach) itself, as expressive vessel of the conscious hypostases, that interpretively projects the angle and thus determines overall degree of displacement functionally aligning the cognitive grid through which its hypostases must sub- sequently function, according to greater or lesser measures of Identity-investment (the greatest measure of identity-investment being donated by the Psychic hypostasis or individuated atman most easily understandable as yourself). It's for this reason that Sephiroh of Circles (vital-soul or Nephesh, the principle of Akash etc.) is clearly depicted in Lurianic Qabala as never extending below the Daath juncture (i.e. the Abyss between Macroprosopus of the Supernals, and Microprosopus of the \"created worlds\"). The Creation never suffers a literal \"fall\"; the Sakti never really descends into the infernal worlds, the Shekinah is never actually exiled in the desert of manifestation where the wandering tribes of Israel"},{"pageNumber":974,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV seek their Creator amidst the sand and brush. Nonetheless everything suffers a \"conse!quence\" as if it were literally so--and this owing to the angular displacement between Straightlight (Fohat) and Circles (Saktz] generating an apparent Parental discrepancy regarding means and mode in the Alignment of Resolution between finite and Tnfiriite-a discrepancy which is, however, just as clearly the product of a mirroring mechanism whereby the minutest interpretive \"distortion\" between the ideoform vehicle of Volitional Straightlight and the permissive limit-value of Akash (finitizing void-space) becomes reflected and magnified--by runaway exponential extension and deductive enacting--through the obligingly impressional Matrix of the Mother's speculum facets, the shimmering crystal-net of Her global unity approximated in rectilinear geometries. \"Binding By Striking\": The Lovesong Of Ike And Tina Luria (Or, Why Humanity Tends To Belong To A Dysfunctional Family) To Fohat is theosophically attributed a kind of \"serpentine\", zig-zag motion; for this reason also it's often equated directly withkundalini-s&. But we may see this exact zig-zag motion depicted as the so-called Lightningflash incandescing the connective Paths of the Oh Chaim (Tree of Life) diagram introduced by Lurianic Qabala These countercrossing paths linking circular Sephiroh are ascribed to Ruach4pirit- and the Sephiroh of Straightline. The interposition of a linear gap between any pair of Circular Sephiroh is attributable to the initial cosmogonic description wherein the ten Sephiroh of Circles (Nephesh or vital-soul of theQanskrit-Mulaprakn'tr) are comprehended entirely within the fhmework of roor andfirst rhree stages of Straightline Sephiroh; the fourth Stage of Straightline, unable to penetrate and subsume the corresponding limit of Restriction in the parallel stage of Vessels (circular Sephiroh) enters a critical phase called \"binding-by-striking\", which in effect replaces the fourth stage of Vessels in the Circular Sephiroh with a phase of Curtain4e noetic Light of Straightline, \"bound\" to the logic of literalized limitation in the fourth stage of Circles which it \"strikes\", thereafter reflects all implications embedded in the cosmogonic encounter by extending its own fourth phase, as mirroring Curtain, across the \"abyss\" into and as the field of manifestation or \"created realms\" of Microprosopus. It shadows and repeatedly echoes the initial encounter \"above the abyss\" (in the realm of the Supernals) through all the Sephirothic phases \"below the abyss\", thereby reflecting the presence of the ten Circular Sephiroh at each Sephirothic junction comprising extension of its own last two phases below (its third phase above still b'trailing\", as it were, from lack of transitional fulfillment to the fourth phase above-+ incidentally answers an unanswered question hanging from redactions of Lurianic Qabala, over which presentday Qabalists mumble and swiftly slur as a \"verboten\" subject of inquiry out of deferential obsequy to the Qodisheh of old Isaac-4.e. if the Curtain of Straightlight extending below the Abyss is expression of the \"rebuffed\" fourth stage of that Light, how is it that the third stage of Straightlight makes its reappearance as the World of Yetzirah before it strikes the fourth and last stage of the extended Tree, as Assiah? Time's up--the answer is, because the third Stage above was \"left hanging\" as it were, owing to the inability of fourth Stage to fulfill itself immediately by entering in and directly subsuming the Vessel of Receival for Circular Sephiroh. Since, as Qabalists well know, the Kether of a succeeding World is the Malkurh of the World above, Straightlight could not complete its third phase above since that third"},{"pageNumber":975,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV phase would have required a Ketheric point for its fourth phase in which to ground itself--which, as we see, is impossible owing to its being \"locked out\" by fourth phase of Receival in Circles, above. Any other \"answer\", hasn't understood the question.) Non-Qabalists should get sufficient gist of this littie discursive entree to the subject, having read the non-technical exegeses of these self-same principles previous-in this essay, the Mother Terasu treatises etc. None of the MT expositions owe their insight to a study of Lurianic Qabdism in any case--any more than Luria's original eqositions were indebted to reading knowledge out of their own unwritten texts! The origin of insight is the same in bothvrimary, not secondary. Elucidarion of Lurianic Qabala rrs well rrs all other mystic andesoteric teachings, derives its efficacy in these pagesfiom initiatic wisdom always seeing directly with Subtle Eye, and the awakened heart of direct Intuitive howledge. As another great Qabalist has sad it has really nothing to do with being merely '7eanted': This is why the lightning£lash of Fohat seems to \"skewer\" the reflected spheres of nature-matter as on a zigzag shish kabob. In fact it doesn't penetrate the degree of Restriction in nature-matter at all, but rather carries the reflection of the latter \"forward\" into the mirroring modes of creation as a kind of rippling Pool for imaging of the informing Ideotype. Superficially, it would seem that the Circular Sephiroh (the phases of Akash) are merely inerf and that therefore all the intelligence codes and instruments of action attributed to the nature pattern are, indeed, the property of Noetic light, as it's the latter which seems to move and be mirrored in angulated flux across a resistively stationary field. The Mother's Version (In The Ongoing Custody Suit) Shifting to the viewpoint of Prakrit (Circular Sephiroh) however, we recall perhaps fi-om the Mother Terasu treatises the way in which the Point-limit of matter has a motive and kind of consciousness of its own4ough in itself this consciousness is un- or subconscious, it's inspirited with the drive toward Conscious wholeness as the quintessential expression of the power in that wholeness. There is (an at least) rudimentary soul and tendency-to-realization in the delimited void-point of matter. Opaque in itself, it's an empty opacity which therefore employs the very feeling involved in its aspirational self-surpassing to extend sensitive tendrils of core identification along the coordimtive fabric woven, by reflection of no& light, off its own delimiting presence. All such fundamental units of nature-matter are, then, modes of Absolute Itself in Its apprehension of potential Limit within Itself; the unitive ideotypes imagistically woven about them by reflection of noetic light are therefore recognitions or identifications within Absolute of the specific potential each such unit brings to It. Each unit, imbued with and endowed by blessing of the Whole and inspirited-in degree-by consciousness of the whole, comprises the effective agency operating coordinative counterparts of its contractile limit through identification along the rejexive light channels enwrapping and \"clothing\" it. While the noetic light of consciousness-mat- ter imparts the ideofoxm qualities by which the nature-field may be known, it's the inbuilt vitalistic tendency of nature-matter itseif(the rudimentary consciousness-unit) through which the lineaments of that light are functionally engaged and electrically aligned, as autonomic operatives of a vibrant life pattem. There is, then, Light and Life as the ancients have reiterated, unified and fulfilled by Love. We may clearly distinguish between the noetic Light of Fohat, and the electric light of"},{"pageNumber":976,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the sakti-current though they are ''two sides\" of a single stream of Bliss-love Being. Fohat is Light of consciousness-matter pertaining to the transdimensional axis or, physically, the central nervous system. Sakti is Operative of the reflected light identifiable as nature-matter, pertaining to the spheres or enveloping Worlds of that axis and correspondhg physically to the autonomic nervous-systems. When, through \"yoga\" etc., the Sakti seems dciently harmonized in its polar currents to converge upon and \"move through\" the Central Channel, it remains nature-force throughout--though the yogis indiscriminately attribute to it a type of Divine Spirit consciousness exhibiting the unfolding intelligence of the vital-codes formerly enfolded through it. In conjunction with the cerebrospinal axis or conscious channel, the awakened kun- hlini-sakti has the opportunity of being directly regulated and guided by a type of Oversoul consciousness functioning through Fohat or noetic Light (i.e. the Archangelic intelligences, superior Hypostases etc.) meeting and manying it through the Common course. This depends preeminently on the type of (indispensable) mediation afforded through embodied \"emissary\" or representative soul-presence of the Psychic Hypostasis--the incarnate consciousness we conventionally mean by \"I\". We must examine more closely just how this works. Faculties And The Hypostases In conventional anatomy, the peripheral nervous systems are a direct extension of the central nervous system; the autonomic nervous systems are less direct branches of that central system. Since the senses are associated with the peripheral nervous system, we may say they have a direct relation to the central nervous system or conscious channel; at the same time, the senses are physiologically linked, in a \"mysterious\" way through the \"black box\" of the reticular formation, to nerve-bundles of the autonomic processes. Esoterically this corresponds to the ancient fact that the senses are emissaries of the conscious channel, and operate the autonomic coordinates of the subconscious channel. Consulting diagram 2 once again, we may note that the systems of the \"physical body\" are compound projections of the values belonging to Hypostases discretely distributed in mutually- perpendicular relation along the \"vertical\" (multidimensional) axis. Thus the faculties, senses and - - systems perceived on the comparatively \"flat\", horizontal plane, comprise composite contributions of the projective hypostases collectively and represent discrete values of a particular Hypostasis individually. Vision is not, then, the perception of physical objects essentially; it functions first through its own vital-etheric plane, that of the radiadfiery current, as receptor and transmitter of the noetic value belonging to the Identity hypostasis; as etheric-current operator of the structuring field of physicality (hsiah), Vision encodes the basic ideorype as which its imagistic network is to be elaborated. Vision, being the primary \"sense\" (owing, as we've shown, to the comparative immediacy of its unitive apperception), coordinates the operations of the others, and supervises the specific o~ganizational qualities belonging to the others; the other senses operatefirn ofal through the value-typologies and organic agencies peTtaining to the faculty of Vision. Just as Vision corresponds to idea and the Identity hypostasis, Hearing corresponds to the patterning implications conveyed through ideoform code and thus to the hypkasis if Mind. Though its correlated (vital-etheric) current is therefore the fluidlairy breathstream, Hearing first of all operates in and through the radiant/fiery medium belonging to the regnant faculty of Vision."},{"pageNumber":977,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV The faculty of taste corresponds to formative implications carried in the patterning typology and thus to the Psychic hypostasis of the Form World; its principal operation (from the same, radiant-fiery breathstream) is that of organizing by implied affinitiedantipathies, which it serves through its own fluidwatery current. The faculty of Smell and the sense of Touch correspond to structuring values of the structuringfield itself, i.e. the \"physical world\" giving the resistance-limit or density quotient for matter in the sense ordinarily assumed. These faculties have no corresponding Hypostases. Indeed they emblernize the property of Akash or nature-matter per se, and are related only indirectly to informing values of Consciousness-matter distributed through Foh of the vertical axis. The faculty of Smell functions first of all fiom the common plane of Vision or that of the radiantlfiery current, and is processed through all the regular channels or breath-streams modified therefrom. Its own corresponding medium is the solidearthy breath current of the vital-physical vehicle (informing the ordinary flux field we identify with \"breath\"). The sense of Touch, while ordered and imbued with correlative meaning through the preceding breath-streams, does not function from levels of the infeeding currents themselves but operates immediately through solidearthy agent of the vital physical vehicle. These subtle observations are directly paralleled by the fact that, in terms of \"monodimensional\" physiology, all faculties but the sense of touch are processed through the thalamus (a lobe associated chiefly with vision). Faculties And The Autonomic Currents (Also, Fixing A Few Holes In Acupuncture Points Etc.) We've previously recited the correlation of etheric breath-streams with the reflexam- posite systems of the gross physiology. The relation of sense faculties to autonomic systems is thus plain, since they're linked through their respective etheric-current processes. Vision, corresponding to the radiant-etheric current, is therefore associated with the generative (nervous and hormonal) systems of the gross physiology. Hearing, corresponding to the fluidairy current, is associated with the respiratory system of the physical vehicle. Taste, corresponding to the fluidwatery current is associated with the circulatory system. The faculties of Smell and Touch correspond to the solideatthy current; they are therefore related to the digestive system of the physical vehicle. The regulatory operation of these autonomic-physiological processes by the correspond- ing sense faculty, is functional expression of the general order of influence obtaining between the conscious and subconscious systems (i.e. consciousness-matter of Fohat or the central channel, and nature-matter of Sabi and its autonomic currents). The sense-faculties are related, remember, through the peripheral nervous systems to the central nervous system. This means of course that the sakti-currents (breath streams) of the autonomic processes and--ultimately--the gross physiology are organized and coded in their interactive patterns by noetic values of the dominant ideotype. They are not fixedindependent structures of objectivized matter at all (as if the nervous systems and physiological processes had just a single set form through which consciousness was condemned to operate); they are, on the contrary, variable and elastic response pattern encoding flexible coordinates on behalf of a consciousness virtually pledged to change and subliminally dedicated to upward development, in progressively higher degrees of"},{"pageNumber":978,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV integration or alignment-intensity. Herein we're shown a very specific etiology; it possesses specific implications regarding the primary order of influence in the perennial debate between mind and body, the direction of flow in the organization of processes as well as the character of the directorial agency, and suggests also the most effective fulcrum for inducing beneficial change. Because of this, the reader will note in the following Table of Mind/Body classifications how the conventional wording-and thus, the informing concept--has been advisedly changed in such matters as acupuncture meridians, where for example it's classically stated that the liver \"controls\" the faculties of vision and motor functioning. While we honor the validity ofthese correspondences and subtle connections, the scope of the context in which we integrate them obliges a real reestimation of the ways in which they're discussed. Thus we would say, under the general heading, that subtle values of \"the liver\" encode and convey correspondences relative to primary noetic values belonging to the sense-category \"vision\", and volitional values involved in efferent currents of the motor faculties. The choice of wording from the advisory concept, depends on direction of approach to the given field to begin with. The science of acupuncture begins from the physical angle; manipu- lation of yu points mapped across the body exhibits demonstrable connection to far areas and to faculties, senses and systems supporting psychic properties (mood, feeling, thinking, perception). As with neural stimulation of certain cortical areas in the parallel domain of occidental science, evidence suggests a causal connection: when a physical zone is triggered, a corresponding mental or motor trait arises in response, so that the one seems to mandate the other. Indeed we can identify a conditioning influence encoded in currents, meridians and nerve-networks of the body; yet that matrix of conditioning is aligned and locked in place to begin with through value typologies emanating from factors of the consciousness-systems (the central and peripheral nerve networks and their corresponding \"sheaths\" or subtle vehicles). Such typologies key the processing currents through which correlated faculties and functions enforce the given values; habituation of such currents to patterns of the prevailing ideotype lock faculties and functions in place, generating persuasive sets of loci or coordinative crossroads for vital-etheric networks (serving to condition coaxial alignments whereby consciousness takes expression in the field of Action). Bugging The Programmer: When The Variable For \"Virile\" May Only Be Read As \"Viral\" How Do You Fecundate The Format Without Fatally Infecting The Program? Considering our description of ordering current-processes and their corresponding values, the reader should have questions regarding the ways in which we practically perceive. If, for example, the reigning principle of our mind-body patterns is the ideotype, focused through the conscious axis according to its own lights and decreeing the basic value-of-existence as Noetic, why is it this quality seems secondary and subjective in practice, recommends itself least as the ordering principle of life and appears thoroughly subordinated to material properties? How is it things don't seem to convey the subtlety ofpsyche, but the inert resistance of an objectively-opposable world? The answer to these significant questions, has to do with a trick clause in the currently governing ideotype. Suppose, just on speculative whimsy, that you were in charge of \"loading\" the content-value of the ideotype the way we learn to program software of a computer. Let's say you"},{"pageNumber":979,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV spent a lot of quality free-time loading in programs which allowed consciousness to float through brilliant seas of its own self-evident nature, manufacturing kaleidoscopic ranges and landscapes fantastique wherein Mind might enjoy its native elusiveness, its dazzlingly shapeshifting faculty, its power of sounding any imaginable tone without restriction or prior qualification ... including those potential tones that resonated to values of resistance and inertial opacity giving the contrastive exhibition of what consciousness constitutionally isn 't ... Let's say you're the Wiz who concocts a clever program based on these apparently paradoxical values, turning out new lines of software specifically designed to task the powers of resolution to the tolerance of your \" e. What is the devilishly ingenious device behind these new kinds of program? Suppose we were furnished software through which we were to operate, encoded with instruction that the native character of such software as idea-typology was to be speciiically subordinated to one particular idea-typology, i.e. that of the non-ideative, objective and inerthesistive nature of the program itself? Suppose the uniform and indivisible character of the software as abstract idea-typology had coded into it the antinomid idea of a dualistic division between such unitive value and its apparent anti-value, the dualism itserffumishing-and firnction- ing as--the anti-value, so that existence in the fke-variable form of mind through Illimitable Void-conscious Being was counterposed against one of the chief qualities allowed admittance through that fke variable. Such counterposition or seeming competition between the fke-variable factor of noesis and the conditional character of concrete existence automatically compromises and so subordinates the very spirit of the ideotype, the essential soul of the ike-variable, blindering it with dualistic extremes confining its freedom to a restrictive venue of contingency-options. Clever program, no? The question then becomes, how does (or can) the conscious rnahfiame work itself out of the inbuilt knots and selfkipping snares of the program? Transfmed By The Past, Fixated On The Future- Mailing Mind As Matter With Plenty Of Return Postage And A Self-addressed Envelope Something very much like this takes place through the m.nd/body processes described above. Noetic Light (Light of Identity) hm the Conscious Axis enters into play with the saki current through locus of the third eye/crown-physically, the complex of patterns enfolding the pineal gland--by reflexively illumining its processes. Rather than steadily modeling the etheric nerve-currents in unitive light of the conscious axis (by giving the Whole-being value of Identity itself as their consistent organizational object and having them conformally aligned with it, by taking it as their Common Denominator) the noetic light is apparently deflected \"offside\" through its zone of interception with the polarized currents; it's apparently captured in their operations, as if its self-illumining character had been peremptorily appropriated for the highlighting of aims and objects of their own. That noetic Light, entering at the third-eye, seems immediately absorbed by the energies operating the two-eyed stereopsis of anisomehic vision, and expelled through actions conforming to the displacement-orientation of exteriorized value commitment (in identification with projective qualities assessed as to their proximal \"unity\" according to purely prehensile measure- ment). Owing to the literalizing character of such processes, noetic light is so subordinated to the relative projection patterns of the Sakti-current that it tangibly displaces out into the general"},{"pageNumber":980,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV field as them, absorbed through and as the coextensive nature streams becoming,+agmented-oflits consubstantial alignment with the Axis of Identity and embedded in tattvic tides, floated along vital conduits so as to light internally the configurative fields of all the creatures cutting phases and angular facets to the central Self-conscious axis (or transdimensional Line), like the flame inside a jackolantern. Since such Light is in its own nature One and indivisible, the \"fragments\" into which it seems to be pulled by identifications of the naturecurrent are ultimately illusory. This is why such literalizing processes may be attributed to Maya, the Play of Illusion in Hinduism. At the same time, however, the actual wholeness belonging to such apportioned units of noetic Light-value loans a thoroughly convincing and tenacious quality to the patterns apparently conscripting it. Even for the myriad entities lacking degree of integration equal to alignment with the self-conscious axis, the unity of the light-value imparting cohesiveness to the reflected silhouette of their sensuous operations instills a vital confidencesf-identification that brooks no flicker of doubt, giving Nature on balance the sure-footed narcissism of a Cat. In this way we may think ofNoetic Light as streaming in on Mind-born rays of its creative seed-state, lighting up interior pmcesses of the psycho-physical form through efficient agency of the \"thirci eye\" and flowing along channels of those processes in irregular emission into streams of the nature field. Light of noesis seems conformally to \"attach'' itself, by its internally illumining power of identity, to vital energies involved in hormonal manufactory and chemistries of the nervecomplexes so as to run the balance of the body and selectively \"light\", while aligning, the sensory-motor systems ordering the network of experience. This whole and indivisible Light appears divided up and eventually scattered, like pieces of the Osirian body or the Lot of clothing, into elemental appendages and adornments-of-identifi- cation marking haughty flourishes and features of the nature-kingdom with all its host of creatural \"rabble\". Light of noesis issues intermittently, in bursts ofvariable interlocked cycles, along streams of exteriorizing identity directly through the pineal, out through the sense f8CU1ties and motor functions, through pores and radiations of the skin surface, from cerebral or sexual activity, from excitations or exertions of the heart, moresr-less intensely through the chakracenters according to degree and orientation of engagement and in waves of emission from palms or soles of feet. All beings of the nature-pattern, while subsisting \"beyond time\" as consciousness units presenting specific ontological \"posers\" to intelligent infinity, receive their coordinative frame- works and contextual enthusiasms hm qualities of identification patterned, aligned and projected through Median agency of the self-reflective Axis; since all such beings take fonn as \"embryonic\" states of the Self-conscious state, organized from elemental aspects of the thought-structures and feeling tones emitted as \"complete\" expressions of self-reflective agency, it's appropriate in one sense to view the human vehicle as the \"future\" form of all aeatwes and entities of the elemental kingdoms presently furnished habitable networks-of-identification hm the exudate and radiant vital-electric overspill of nature oriented man. By the same token, all states, qualities, entities and forms constituting objectssf-perception in the nature-field may be symmetrically considered \"past\" predications of man. The presently available Whole-being potential characteristic of the very state of Self-re- flective consciousness, is not the value presently realized; rather, conditional qualities of color, odor, texture, creatural being and elemental ergos monopolize the apparatus of attention for the majority Soul in incamation, so that the tendency of the potentiated Vessel of Whole-being is to look back"},{"pageNumber":981,"pageContent":"MATRIX N upon itself, to4 effect--dwell in contemplation and absorbed consideration of the states and qualities from which it has emerged, to brood over the creatural values from which it's woven its body and that have thus been assimilated as facultative agencies and facilitating instruments of itself. This symmetric temporalization betvieen \"past\" and \"future\" states of the same essential consciousness-unit represents the necessary lag time between integration and thorough introjection of the strings of elemental properties associated with phyla of the nature-field (the apprenticeship-tefiain of flowers, fawns and faery-energies), and understanding of their integral value--the one being a function of the causal body summing all levels of apprenticeship in the nature-field while furnishing the vehicle of emergence for the consciousness-unit aligned to fullscale partnership with the Self-reflexive axis, and the other characterizing a function of the Whole-being value potentially available through that optimal axis. Therefore while your presence as a \"human being\" and all the creatural kingdoms composing your \"human environment\" seem to transpire on the same plane, in an homogenous context, they do not. In perceiving the patterns of nature you're in fact viewing the cinema-presen- tation of your own past. You're looking out on \"past\" states of the consciousness-unit which you are, both figuratively and literally. The current vitality of your own identification-patterns reaches out, from your \"present\" state, into the nature-kingdoms modeling modes and manifestations of your past (i.e. out of your characteristic, ideative amplifications and preoccupations). Physical And Spiritual Time: Not So Much A Matter Of \"Telling Time\", As Of Time Telling You Thus the \"world we know\" is not just a spatially organized hierarchy of kingdoms, a kind of pyramidal foodchain with 'cself-conscious creatures\" on the top; it's a compound field of temporal striations apparently informing and serving to organize a \"single\" space-which, as we've seen, is a telescoped composite across a \"horizontal\" plane, of densities and dimensional levels vertically distributed in projective perpendicularity to one another and jointly to the physical field. There is, then, not oniy a horizontal \"temporality\" in terms of linear directional flow pointing an arrow entropically \"one-way\"; there is a vertical stream of temporality flowing through the transdimensional Axis. This may be considered a kind of spiritual time. In its approach to b'intersection\" with the horizontal (physical) plane it coincides with the pole of itselfthat's relatively \"past\", in term of spiritual time; considered at the opposite pole, or in progressively higher phases of ascent toward that pole, its towering verticality marks transdimensional states and stages considered relatively \"future\" with respect to lower phases and to the nether polarity coinciding with physical-time expression. Horizontal Time The lower polarity of the vertical axis (intersecting and feeding the compound, \"hori- zontal\" or shadow plane) constitutes a kind of \"past\" state in spiritual time, and may be considered relatively un-integrated-all existent unities distributed in mutual relation through that field take their organizational point-of-departure from angles displaced to greater or lesser degree porn the central-unifying Axis, so that the average quotient of tension amongst unities for which the resolving value of the axial Denominator isn't available tends to be maximized. The quotient of resultant"},{"pageNumber":982,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV fiiction is proportional to the ordering degree of tension, so that a state of overall entropy seems to characterize this pole at which unitary complexes are obliquely organized (with respect to their mutual and resolving axis). Even the agency of Self-reflexive consciousness itself is, as we've seen, organized through (projectively displacing) focal-coordinate alignments in relation to the \"physical\" polar- ity-which makes itsfunctional presence a general expression and exemplification of the entropic nature-field. Its alignment of identity is set at an oblique angle with respect to its own-potentially available--axis. It's this specific, focalcoordinate alignment which orders the energies of the conscious ID-pa#erns in such a way as to displace them through the extended field, imparting elemental qualities and affective implications (embedded in typologies of the patterns) to mirror coordinate attributes assembling the description of the nature current For this reason, the light-pat- terns weaving identification phases of the nature field run entropically in an apparently one-way dissipation stream. The \"future\" oriented mw for the horizontal axis, considered isolated and in-itself, seems strictly degenerative so that everything would appear to decay toward progressively less ordered states. Vertical Time On the other hand, we've seen that the temporal arrow for the vertical time axis moves toward a \"future\" when aimed in the upward direction; the \"future\" along the vertical, spirimal time axis is oriented in a direction diametrically awayfiom the physical field of optimallyYoblique alignment/organization. Thus the \"future\" in terms of spiritual time is progressively more ordered, increasingly integrated and directly aligned in congruence with the central-resolving Axis. Since that Axis represents the value of self-reflective (or univetsalized) consciousness, higher degrees of integration congruent to its essential value represent deeper phases of Conscious realization. Just as the horizontal arrow of strictly physical time seems to \"unzip\" in the future-ori- ented direction, so the vertical mw of spiritual time seems to zip up in the \"future\" direction. This of course gives us a more cogent view, in terms of the natural science, of those perennial scriptural references characterizing the \"future\" 'for strictly se~lsuous existence as Death, while the \"~e\" for the Being in spirit is contrarily characterized as Life-everlasting. More than this, however, it gives us a way of understanding a certain inbuilt mechanism for the achievement of whatever truth may lie at the core of such injunctions. Idea As \"A Being\" Of Being, And \"A Being\" As The Being Of Idea First of all, we've seen how the \"entropic\" field of nature tends to be organized and projectively patterned in the first place on the basis of ideorypes (generated through the centraUver- tical axis of Self-conscious soul being as thoughts, moods, feelings, desires and intents) command- ing a suf5cient threshold degree of identity-value. This seeding of the nature field with luminous filaments of encoded identity-value, is in itself a necessarily synergic or negatively entropic process. There's been persistent effort in certain areas of science to detect a negenfropic phase of the nature-pattern; it seems the clever confection of processes entropic in themselves but \"driven far fkom equilibrium\" or topologically twisted, for example, so as to account for the evident ordering"},{"pageNumber":983,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV function in growing and evolving things, provides but pale simulacrum within thermodynamic limits of those truly negentropic powers exhibited by the enchanted renewals and regenerations of nature. From our present viewpoint we may see that the authentically neg-entropic bctions of life derive not fiom processes on the strictly horizontal plane', but rather arise through a multidimensional matrix of \"vertically\" ordered elements integrated through whole-being value of the initiatory ideorype. The life patterns of a chick-in-embryo, of a pumpkinseed, the spores of a fungus or the odds-defying endurance of a proton, are inspirited fiom the inside-out; all such seed-potential of the nature field is built up \"in secret\", hm within, taking life and light fiom the subtle states and an ultimate integrity fiom the abstract unity of the informing type. Spatially configured entities of the physical field are therefore ordered fiom internal sequences of a spiritual time process. The priorities of sequence in this zone of time, have to do with intent rather than structure, organizing abstract value of the identity investment rather than rigidly-locked rotations of inevitably repeating cycles (this state of affairs may be identified in, and accounts for, certain basic anomalies of quantum physics--see \"What Is Physics?\"). From this we see that the organidon of forms and entified fields in the nature-pattern is product not only of an authentically negentropic process; it's product as well of a type of knotting or entangling of the noetic light-value belonging to identity of the Conscious axis, provisionally committed in identification to signature codes of the coinvolved planes (carrying forward seeds of sentient quality and coordinative agency subtly folded through a given self-conscious thought, desire, feeling, motive or belief). We're familiar with the apt metaphorical resonance between an abstract idea, sentiment or image and some creatural \"quality\" imparting to the perceptual field an enriching parallelism of type-* when a behavior exudes a \"spidery\" character, or a personality known to daylight consciousness appears with tailored appropriateness as a dragonfly in dream. Such rich analogical relationship between abstract and concrete, the qualitative and quantitative--in effect giving psychic, emotional and ideative meanings an immediate vocabulary of real images--exists in the first place owing to the complex creatural character of every idea as living estimation of the coordinate whole, and the ideoform character of every creature (in expressive registry of being-val- ues through pickup networks or unitive impressional webs of the coordinate whole). Their happy interparticipation isn't simply the homologous result of existing in the \"same kind of world\". I Don't Care What He Says: It's Still Hard To Believe \"No Fat Chicks Allowed\" Sums A Philosophical Case Every Bit As Much As The Timaeus Self-conscious thoughts, possessing a threshold intensity-value of idenfity and of will- converted fiom the gathered energy-capital of desire--aren't just heat-exhalations of the head; they're composed by and through the same interaction of coordinative centers making up the mindbody complex. They express ratios in the relative contributors of each chakra zone, ganglionic axis or cross-road cluster in the patterning processes of the overall form. They're therefore the interpretive representations of the universe of that form. The mind/body form of the Self-reflective being, so we've seen, isn't some speck in an indefinitely large field but a nested pattern of polarizing networks distributed through the common, transdimensional Axis or universal Pleroma comprising the Emanative Line of Logos. Each actuated"},{"pageNumber":984,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV thought, mood, belief or desire, as representative expression of the total fonn in its visible and invisible parts, is therefore a kind of stylized microcosm of that universe (regardless how apparently meretricious may be the thought-content in itself).

Rather than belonging to the class of \"insubstantial subjectivityw--as it would seem fiom the ordinary invisibility of the dimensions through which it's active--each such thought is packed with seed-potential of the planes and worlds where it's really formed; each grabs the abstract geometry indicative of compositional coordinates for the world or plane and inscribes the adapta- tions of each in a common \"cotyledon\" ofmemory traces, made magnetically secure in all its phases and density-transitions by virtue of the noetic light-value serving as substance of its persistent \"self\" reflection. All such seeds, sown through the ground-of-being as bounty of a consciousness conceptually aware of itself, come to fhition in due course according to coordinates of cosmic and personal timing. If, however, the soul-being is continuously linked by threads of identification to the resultant nature-processes and psycho-active qualities presented in the pattern of every objectivized form, the question might well be asked whether the organicpersistence of form (so \"self-evidently\" desidle to those who value manual life and the mutually-supportive realms of nature) necessitates a hidden though potentially undesirable consequence: that is, the persistent attachment of the psyche by bio-adaptive affinity of its own thought-forms, to creatural cycles and the nature-realm in general so that buddhistic woes of the bodily existence are thus all-unknowingly maintained, being leashed to the rack of the Wheel-of-LSe and clueless as to the self-inflicted cause. Negative Response To The Nature-link (Or, Loaning A Whole New Dimension Of Meaning To McLuhan9s \"Extension-amputation And ~Srnbing\") This question isn't novel; know it or not, it has been and is being asked quite seriously as the ultimately-serious consequences of the conclusions generate the range of orientational allegiance factoring out as perennial philosophies or fixed theologies East and West, as well as the Positive and Negative lines of development growing like beanstalks out of the 3rd density medium itself into respective, higher density worlds of implication. The Negative response to the proposition, we've characterized in detail in other essays; it may simply be summed as the decision to adopt an artificial insularity of \"seihess\", suitable to synthesize a \"chill\" identity emotionally neutered with respect to (potentially self-wounding or seditiously imbalancing) passional attachments and so seemingly distanced hm \"organic\" iden- tifications, yet by just that magnitude of distance estranged fiom the real resolution or emotionally melting denouement of unity-recognition and releasing acceptance; as substitute for such recogni- tion and in the face of an ongoing identification with powers of the manifest field exacerbated by the denial-gap, the Negative decision consolidates 'round a kind of universal dominance wherein lingering links of identification may seem satisfied through subjection of every form-holding a \"piece\" of the subject-portrait-to the imperial Identity of the \"completed\" (because perfectly"},{"pageNumber":985,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV uncompromised) self. Positive Response To The Nature-link: Remember The AGammo(ne AKA-nuttin')* Initiated Interpretation from Positive side of the Perennial Mystery Schools, on the other hand, recognizes the ultimate cul-de-sac character or final irresolution embedded in any such orientation. (If we ask why Initiated Interpretation should forward such far-sighted vantage on its side, of which the negative seems comparatively incapable, we'd advisedly refer to former SC essays in which the relations between \"higher\" degrees of Initiation and \"lower\" for Positive and Negative poles were characterized as respectively open in the one, closed and constitutionally dissembling in the other, since the Negative hierarchy wishes to mask from the lower stages of \"self-serving\" servitors the higher-order goals of cosmic annihilation substituting for the ultimate West inadequacies of identity-abstraction and distancing. The \"final solution\" for the negative interpre- tation of existence regarding persistent bondage to the tarbaby identification patterns of life, is liquidation of the very ground continuously catering such compromise--see Essay VI.) Initiated interpretation returns attention instead to the negatively entropic processes whereby the nature field is built out from primary patterns of Identity-commitment; it would remind that such psychic symbol-projection, encoding creatural forms and bio-magnetic states of the nature field, results from self-representative modes of ideative reflection emanating hm the Conscious Axis. Rather than the Conscious Axis being immediately aware of--and in congruence with-its Absolute Void-value of Identity comprising the irreducible Selhess of Being, it chroni- cally broods over mnemonic states of the nature-pattern hm which it functionally emerges and reflects.

These are the drives, instinctual cla-, biological imperatives as well as the more ambiguous potentials of sheer sensory experience coded into the hindbrain and corresponding plexuses of the abdomen. The \"past\" states of the Conscious Hypostases, imbued with indirect Light luridly illumining the configurative codes for nature-entities displaced--in their aeonic apprenticeship- fiom direct alignment with the Consciousness Axis, call out for the Attention of that Axis so that their \"future\" being in the form of hypostatic powers will send more light through Psychic agency in the committed shape of concem, desire, belief, interest, allure etc. Such \"past\" states of the Hypostases, as consciousness-units elementally integrated through the nature-field and indirectly illumined, in degrees, as sentient gestalts by pattenzing coordinates angularly related to the Conscious Axis, carry forward their very existence on deep subconscious drive for direct fulfillment values of Whole-being light. Thus they call implicitly to their future \"self', or the fundamental Identity of that light in the form of the Conscious Hypostases.

In this way the apprenticeship transmigration of the rudimentary consciousness-unit through increasingly complex realms of the nature field (as described in \"What is 'Christ Con- sciousness'?\") traces a cumulative spiralic memory-path enriching itself through continuous recourse at deeper degrees of integration-potential commensurate with the additional complexity of the superadded \"tum\".

It may move from pranic energy-charge to grazing cow, working itself up through amoeba and housecat; the comprehensive form as which it may incarnate itself, in penultimate magnification of informing light-value to the Transition stage of Self-reflexive Soul complex, is that of the causal vehicle (or Soul body--known anciently and referred to here as the \"breath-soul\"). Be-cause (HADIT), The Night (NUIT) Was Made For Lovers (RA-HOOR-KHUIT) The breath-soul is a kind of summary record and functional distillate of everything the nature-field represents; it's a universalized \"score\" and impressional repository of all the life-func- tions coordinatively rudng through and as the nature-field. It is therefore a model and vehicle of the autonomic totality of manifestable life. It is not itself the Psychic Hypostasis or Soul-being--that Event awaits one more transitional phase, through the magical exchange-pleroma, once the consciousness unit has served its definitive apprenticeship as the breath-soul or causal vessel. Having accomplished this over eras of \"time\", it may indeed make the lapdissolve transition into coincidence with its own future self, becoming basically identical to the self-reflective Being of the Conscious Hypostases while effectively functioning as the Psychic hypostasis, or microcosmic soul-being--now operatively aligned in identification with its coordinative soul-vehicle or causal body made up of \"past\" states as a consciousness-unit apprenticed to the nature patterns. As we've seen, in that auspicious condition (''your\" present state) the Psychic hypostasis or soul-being of the Conscious Axis remains provisionally unaware, in direct manner, regarding its status as Consciousness but rather broods upon the impressional matrix of \"past\" states, that is, it dwells for some time in exclusive contemplation of the nature-worlds, of exteriorizing sense-expe- rience rendering symbols and self-representations through pattern of the pranic field etc. Thus the soul-being perpetuates unconscious symbiosis with that field, by drawing clear light fkom its own axis in displacement through identification-patterns illumining the relative realms as reflective maintenance of their courses. Consciousness-units of pre- and sub-conscious grades align and \"focus\" through such illumining coordinates in oblique orientation toward ideal (Whole-being) value of the Conscious Axis. This entire discussion of course presumes the constant supervisory presence of the Conscious Axis to begin with, contrary to present specdative ideas re material evolution which look on the cerebrospinal form of self-reflective consciousness as a dependent development and late-comer. Rather than iron-out all the tangZes of petitio principii and false presumption in the evolutionary scheme, let's leave it for now with the digestible idea that the necessmy Presence of the 111-Consciousness Axis as orientationalfiamework and model through all migratory appren- ticeships in the sub-conscious nature fields, may be accounted for by stating such Presence needn't be physically embodied at all times of Earthdevelopment; it may \"hover \"suspended in the subtle planes, and all its symbolic energy-emanations possessing a degree of intensification past a given threshold standard may manifst through some physicalizedfield where it doesn 't yet dwell in itself: Now we may understand why the sense faculties, organs of perception and action etc. don't--at present--directly yield self-evident testimony to the noetic or ideative character of reality"},{"pageNumber":988,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV insofar as such faculties are connected to and run by the conscious axis through which noetic light-value discharges: though noetic light issues at the \"third eyep7--by physical correspondence the pineal gland--it is displaced through the senses, through motor activity and the manufactory of hormonal complexes suited to run the sexualized'vehicle; it emanates out of the chakra centers, hands and feet, the navel and reproductive organs, the pores and skin dace but it tends not to illumine any such organs or functions in accordance with their noetic nature. All this is due to the fact that noetic light of Identity is mediated, when reflected through the Psychic Hypostasis, by interpretive apparatus of the causal body or breath-soul--the Psyche's subtle vehicle of the nature-patterns through which it's operatively aligned and oriented. Living With The Noetic Type Of \"Materialityw, Or Putting Up With The Down-cycle The noesis of the consciousness axis is certainly drawn on, through Psychic function, in the case of evgr concept or sense-impression, any act or speech; yet the noetic character of any such act or impression tends to be obscured owing to the practid employment to which the life-codes have been put. Noetic light-value is engraved, through space of the Akashic record composing the \"matter\" of the Soul vehicle, as mutually supportive memory impressions expressly filled-out according to the instruction of obliquity, whereby the patterning coordinates of the impression strategically emphasize the kinds of cognitive \"anisomerism\" masking symmetric void-value in favor of ratios stressing ''surf&e contours\" of highlight sensation. If we recall that the noetic seed-idea transmitted by Clear Light of Identity takes shape owing to the patterning coordinates implied therein, and that such coordinates infer the fonn as which governing stress ratios are to organize the ultimate structure, then we may say that the impressions of the A& enforcing autonomic nature-codes are such that the noetic instructions of the informing ideotype specify the subordination of noetic values to the masking stress ratios of stylized relief-structures. The value .of idea itsex is subordinated to the \"idea\" of physicality. Thus in processing the various sense perceptions, cognitive functions and L .~ior activi- ties, the Psychic Hypostasis duly \"rises\" through the conscious axis bringing noetic light-value to bear in the coordination of forms. Yet it rises up \"out of' the passive repository of impressions engraved in autonomic functions of the soul-record, where noetic light is committed by patterns of identification toward dominantly structural interpretation of form. The \"nature-field\" is efficiently locked in place when the strongest and most consistent of these codes predominate. Physically, we may think of Psyche functioning right out of the cerebrospinal column, but effectively sheathed by conditioning memory-patterns of the cortex claiming its committed values of identity through biochemical codes, so that it tends to conform its immediate whole-being value to identification circuits displacing its axial self-congruence (i.e. through preferential subcor- tical zones and corresponding ganglia of the vegetal. plexuses). Considered multidimensionally, we may describe the seed-impressions of the Akash as-effectively-nucleating the noetic value of the informing ideotype, enwrapping it with succes- sive obscuring turns of its own patterning coordinates and finally encasing it in an impressional \"rind\" of structural codes corresponding to a most pronounced physicality. Indeed, pronunciation of the term of physicality is precisely the praenomen such codes are designed to effect, through governance of the sensory-motor keys."},{"pageNumber":989,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Since the causal vehicle (karanu sarira or the subtlest body of Vedanta etc.) patterns the \"successive\" phase space of the vital-etheric geometries, a parallel order is rdected through the organizational currents of the \"physical\" breath pattern. The essentially noetic current of the radiant-fiery phase is, by reflective instruction, subordinated to its own current-modifications. Though the successive phases of the currents should properly be viewed as enveloped each within the other, beginning with the all-enclosing sheath of the radiant-fiery current and ending with the subordinate \"core\" of the vital-physical current, the practical order is exactly opposite. In effect we may say that the proper order is mimred \"below\" as in a pond, its comparatively vertical axis reflected upon the contrastively horizontal plane comprising the composite physical level only inversely, the \"light sources\" by which it's mirrored being bent and distorted in such a way as to nest the current-reflections insideout with the physical envelope exteriorized and the noetic seed-value thoroughly nucleated and obscured. This in fact describes the kundalini apparatus, traditionally the magnetic current or \"serpent-force\" coiled \"at the base of the spine\" through translucent report of subtle vision, and said to be the mechanism responsible for locking the physical fi-amework of focus in place. Thus in present (3rd density) practice, the mental and noetic--or ideative--character of being seems internalized and invisible, insubstantial and purely \"subjective\", while the resistive inertia and opacity of \"physicalized\" existence seems selfkvidently real and objective, descriptively exterior and \"up front\". The kundalini code transcribes, in pre-chemistry language of the structuring field of matter, the balance of elements formulaically engraved as nature impression in the autonomic sum-state of the Akash, or subtle soul vehicle. Though the breath-soul corresponds by degree of refinement and grade of matter to the Psychic field (the Yetziratic world) and is thus the quintessential instrument of Fom, it \"contains\" in its impressions the reflected Light of Mind (patterning process) and Light of Noesis minored through its rippling curls. Co~espondingly, its causative seed-energiesproject coordinative instruc- tions into the succeeding state space, for the enweaving of cognitive structure aligning all infeeding variables to a \"physicalizing\" focus. The state-space of such structure is the phase of nature-saki known as kundalini. In this way we may characterize the existence and function of a processing circuit in the mindlbody form. The Circuit Inside You, Or The \"You\" Inside The Circuit From our diagram (3), we locate the central presence of the causal body (breath-soul). Various traditions variously describe it; confusion in the apparent divergence of descriptions (hm Vedantism to theosophy, Mahayana buddhism to Golden Flower Taoism) may be avoided by realizing that all such descriptions where authentic, spring hm an Inner Vision which however is not necessarily constituted by the same inner faculties or governed by the same alignments of the faculties, ratios of the \"qualities\" etc. hm case to case. Whereas theosophy tends to describe the causal \"lotus\" in terns of petaled bracts one within the other corresponding to the extended chaba.~, Vedantism tends to characterize its linga sarira as a concentric set of spheres situated in a subtle \"cavity\" of the physical heart organ. It is also identified in the Castaneda material as a small glowing orb within the enveloping \"egg\" of the human form. The difference in descriptive characteristics is actually superficial; it is a telltale function of the particular subtle \"angle\", with its identifiable"},{"pageNumber":990,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \\ ASTRAL CAUSAL 6 ETHERIc (KU N DALI N I) Diagram 3"},{"pageNumber":991,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV set of inner instruments aligned according to precepts of the practice, that elicits such signature embroidery for attributes which are actually uniform. Such \"attributes\" refer to cornmonprinciples; and the \"appearance\" of such principles in descriptive terms according to the variant modes of slaying, is strictly secondary. Our description here is based as always on Initiated Insight, opened to the primary organ of Intuition and variously perceived by experiment with filters of the inner faculties in different arrangements so as to be well versed in both universdchangeless principles and the diverse perspectives of the traditions. The advantage to the student of these present teachings in terms of the comparative texts should be apparent. (For an account of the processes through which such stages of Initiation were taken and faculties developed, see \"What Is The Mother Current?\" and \"T-Bird Meets The Phoenix\" Part w.1 The causal body in our diagram (3) is represented by the convention of concentric orbs. Each orb concentrates a universal principle so that-- with Vedantist vocabulary-we have an \"individuation\" of cosmic prabit, of cosmicpranas, of cosmic chitti etc. The Psyche of the Form World (astral state) is coordinatively aligned through this \"individuated\" seed-universe or micro- cosm. This is the vehicle of Microprosopus, concentrating the values of Identity, Noesis, Intuition, Mind etc. from the triadic Countenance of Macroprosopus (for more on the philosophical implica- tions of these values, see section of Liber A1 vel Legis, The Mother Book). Those basic values are elabarated into the impressions or mnemonic codes of the ocean of chitti (the ''thinkhg principle\"), configured through the Akashic space with its pranic geometries of shimmering-kaleidoscopic network maintaining steady triangulation of the void locus comprising litation-orb of ahamkara, or the \"principle of egoity\". In this way we see that basic geometric coordinates composing patterning potentials or subtle prams of the Akashic space, efficiently \"constitute\" the Psyche (or focused self-repre- sentational emissary of the Supernal I.D.) as the centrally-referred convergence radix in the alignment of extension fields latently useful for the filtering of perceptual worlds. The elaborated \"ego\" or centraking self-reference of that-representativejwesence acts as the efficient trans- former of pranic geometries (shimmering like mist from the Akashic field) into specific seed-im- pressions giving pattem and mnemonicfocf to the ideotypes, through processes in the distribution of Identity-value according to curiosity or desire. Such impressions or samskaras make depositional marks that, in totality, comprise the \"ocean of chifti\" (in other modes of symbolic self-representation, this \"ocean\" is characterized as a glittering star field, each star a radiant seed-impression comprising an entry in the ledger of the soul record that indicates an outstanding balance). Stirred movements in this \"ocean of chitti\" are awakened impressions or renewed activation of the mind-forms, efficiently the cognitive product of ego (ahamkara) focused through its coordinative cross-references in alignment with variable states and worlds claiming its interest or attention. Waves or \"rays\" ofpram in the fonn of these impressions rise through the general mist overhanging the \"ocean of chitti\", like beams from a lighthouse bent or distortively curved by covering fog. Thepram or geometrized emanations of the mind-forms, carry noetic light with which they're seeded in the reflective form of subtle pattems activating the mirror-instruments of manas and vgnanas, or \"mind\" and \"intellect\" composing orbs of the asrral sheath. (This is the \"mirror\" of the traditions, on which it's insisted not a speck of \"dust\" should settle.) In practice, the colorful"},{"pageNumber":992,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"dust\" of the impressions flows in a continuous pranic current of variable intensities, forming droplets making up volumes in the stream that turns the agency of mums like a paddlewheel. Manamayakoshu and v~nanamayakoshu (mind and intellect sheaths) act as instruments of attention and selective focus under influence of the \"impressions\" and their radiant pranic streams. Thus we see the spiraling mists of the rays or prank emanations rising fiom the causal body (diagram 3), curling around and composing the involuted folds in the subtle \"sheaths'y of mind and intellect. The ego-soul or Psyche triangulatively \"fixed\" through the causal body, extends up through the axis of pranic flow (we may say this takes place \"within\" the cerebrospinal column of the physical being, as long as we understand &it the physical structure is itself a compound impression reflectively projected by filtrate processes involved in these very \"steps\"). The Transdimensional Organ-grinder Of The Monkey-mind In the standard case of 3rd density consciousness the prams that influence the astral sheaths of mind and intellect are predominantly coded in such a way as to tend toward focal alignment with the etheric fielddensity. The typologies carried by geometrizing coordinates of the pranic streams organize their creative principles as specific ratios of emphasis; each factor of creative processing is assigned a specific \"value\" according to the informing type, so that (for example) in the case of etheric-physical alignment the presiding typology subordinates the noetic value within the cognitive event to formative and structural values---o1eauing in essence that the formulated fascination with relativized contrasts and tensions of contour-emphasis will override all self-evident immediacy of the cognitive datum as ideoform uniw, or abstractly self-constituting identity pattern of purely conscious character. The tendency for cognizing the extended field-of-being (through the various modes of stylized self-representation) is projectively organized as a perception employing the patterning processes as structuring \"organ\" holding all respective values in proper alignment. Each ontological principle within the informing type is therefore represented, according to its assigned \"ratio\", by a corresponding organ or pa#erning instrument. The noetic or idea-value of the given typology is paralleled by the organ of vision, within which the principle of noesis will express itself optimally under the circumstance of being subordinated to fom and structure. The mind-value of the given type is paralleled by the organ of hearing, within which the paneming principle will express itself optimally under the circumstance that it effectively dominates the no&, and is subordinated to form and structure (\"hearing\" is less immediately like an ideative event than \"seeing\", which gives the perception all-at-once as a spatial unity rather than primarily as a temporal sequence that has to be mnemonically synthesized). Therefore, the patterning typology in \"sound\" compromises ideoform immediacy as a compound memory-event \"stretched out\" in time. Concurrently however, the pure synthetic abstraction of \"sound\" is compromised by its subordination to aflective values given through structural resistances, according to the predominant psycho-physical typology. The form-value of the given type is, in turn, paralleled by the organ of \"taste\", within which the affective principle of psyche itself will be expressed optimally, under circumstance that it effectively dominates the ideal and mental and is subordinated to structure. (\"Taste\" with its sweet and sour qualities gives the type of a strong a.ty/antipathy, characteristic of the emotional polarizations claiming identity-commitments of the Psyche.)"},{"pageNumber":993,"pageContent":"MATRIX N The smcture-value of the given type is paralleled by the organ of smell and the sense of touch, within which the principle of resistance-limit will express itself optimally under the circumstance that all previous values of the processing typology are subordinated to it (thus the ideative value of vision is given the resistance-limit of vanishing point perspective etc. as a function of smcrure within that faculty). Note that touch is the most immediately sensate and tangible of the faculties; it tends to set the Standard for what qualifies as \"real\" in the physicalized world of perception. \"Smell\" is the most invasive of the faculties since it has a direct visceral influence. How The Elephant Got Its Ears; How The Lynx Got Its Tail, The Parrot Its Larynx, The Lemur Its Parotid, The Protide Grew Peepers And Man Got His Walking-papers In this way, Psyche seems to \"flow\" in identified conjunction with the streams of pattemingpram emanating from dormant record of the Akash, or heart-vessel (causal body, breath soul). The activated coordinates of the pattern tend to align corresponding complexes making up the several \"organs\", mediating the principles within the presiding type and rendering such principles as faculties in various elemental ratios. Thus the \"organ of vision\" is chiefly a radiant-etheric eye of processing cuxrent-values, coordinatively integrated with and through the succeeding principles and faculties. The \"organ of hearing\" is chiefly a radiant-etheric ear of processing current values, moderating the ideotype while emphasizing the patterning life-stream to which it corresponds--the fluid-aip-and coordinatively integrated with and through the remaining elemental streams and faculties etc. While there's a tendency to view the sense faculties as essentially passive, simply receiving impressions and processing them according to interior activities with which the conscious being seems to have nothing to do, in fact the facuties are actively organized and process their characteristic impressions hm subtle engagement of their coordinative attributes. The pointillist marrk of rods and cones is actively aligned through a sensitive variability of function in order to filter, organize and stylistically \"impress\" the pattern perceived according to requirements of the presiding typology. The extended field of perception abides as a surcharged region or pregnant space of superposed geometric potentials corresponding to the potentials of the pranas constituting the interior mind-body circulation; units in the states of pre-, sub- and unconsciousness focus through such extended field-potential, taking cues of alignments and receiving webs of coordinative light-rays from emanative \"angles\" oriented through the Conscious Axis. Thus all the creatures and things of the extended nature-field take their own specific perceptual \"instructions\" for the assembly of \"a world\" from ideotype requirements patterned through the central, Self-conscious Median. On the other hand they are \"beheld\" through direct operation of the ideotype, as stylized self-repre- sentations structurally \"separated\" into an exterior-objective panorama of creatures and things. How \"Will\" Shalt Show In The Masked And Shadow-Places The active engagement of perceptual coordinates (such as the variable alignment of \"pixels\" in the rods and cones) through agency of the Psyche, expresses subtle presence of will operating the ideoform \"spirit\" of the identification typology. We are not, however, ordinarily aware"},{"pageNumber":994,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of a volitional component to the primary process of perceptual registry (we may be aware, of course, of the intent involved in shifting our eyes or \"focusing\" the direction of sounds through the ears, but the actual event of perceptual registry seems purely passive and mechanically impersonal). Owing to the spontaneity of the volitional component in this case, we aren't aware of its active presence in the adjustment and alignment of facultative coordinates; the Psyche may seem passively aware that it perceives, during the event, but it's unaware that it volitionally tunes the act of perception. This is due to the fact that every phase of existence is a coinherence of passive-and-active values, in variable and changing ratios. The ahhic space of impressions seems fundamentally passive, a repository of mne- monic marks; yet the seed of activity coexists throughout its engraved expanse in the form of the noetic identipvalue nucleating each curled-up symbol glyph. In the same way, the act of perception through the sense-faculties seems largely a spontaneous process relative to which the Psyche abides as passive \"subject\". Yet even in quasi-subliminal states where the subject merely \"drifrs\", paying scarce active attention through any facultative portal, a minor-key component of volitional \"inter- est\" persists in functioning at the door of every available domain. As with the Tai-chi symbol of countercharged colors, there's alternately major and minor contributors in each hue indwelling one another; thus even in instants where the visual window is all-but-glazed-over and opaque to alert impression, a faint psychic outrider enforces influential pressure hm the ideotype-tendency flowing forward on pranic streams so that Will, mounted on its ideotype charge, in effect always answers the call-to-arms and engages the coordinative keys of the sense-faculties (no matter how dreamily or distrszctedly). There is then a type of Will with major active charge (the ordinary consciousness-of- volition); and a type of Will with minor active charge, as we find in the subliminal ordering of sense faculties and the \"involuntary\" motor functioI1S---the latter being identified in yogic Hinduism as Iccha-sakti, or vital-will apparently functioning directly through the nature current. \"Will\" In Nature: Setting The Proper Attracior For The Play Of Shakti The quality of Iccha-sakti is traditionally located in the abdomen; and, while we may identify a type of \"volitional\" imperative informing activity of the nature-cmnt as a whole, it's necessary to discriminate both the inherent drive belonging to \"empty\" consciousness-units composing thepreconscious matrix as well as the elan-vital characteristic ofthe aggregate Nephesh, fiom the root of conscious Will playing in the nature field by displacement-extension through the Central Axis. Thus we find that the vital-etheric breath currents, operated through sensory patterning of ideotype values projected from the conscious channel, accept the \"will\" of the governing typology according to its conscious origin regardless the subliminal character of the conditioning processes. That ''will\" is reflected through--and passed along as-ture codes organizing inter- action of the vital-etheric breathstreams, serving to coordinate \"physical\" phase space geometries. The composite systems of the physical projection, each enacting ratios of the informing current. according to dominant value of the \"breath\" to which it corresponds, consequently embody behaviors that aren't really fixed but rather are firnctions of a \"static variable\", set by Will"},{"pageNumber":995,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV conducting the authority of the given ideotype. These composite systems, as we've seen, are the generative, respiratory, circulatory and digestive systems along with their corresponding endocrines, plexuses and ganglia. Thus the ideoform \"senses\" regulate impressions coding the extended autonomic nerve networks. Each such subconscious system functions according to a set-but secretly variable-lati- tude of processing harmonics; the characteristic rates, rhythms, and ratios of their metabolisms reflective of the governing ''attractor\" impart an overall tendency holding the purview of a particular \"world\" in place. Such typal, processing patterns serve to align, reinforce and regularize the perceptions of which they're the extended coordinates. The matter of \"your\" physical metabolism-familiar as circulation and digestion etc.4~ therefore actually a stylized, reflective self-representation of the means by which \"physicalized\" impressions and sensory-motor values are filtered, aligned and coordinatively maintained in the first place through a perpendicular multidimensionality of life- functions. From the viewpoint of the \"physical\" perspective itself where the whole apparatus is \"stood on its head'?, it may indeed appear as ifthe autonomic processes and their visceral correlatives order and regulate the experience of sense, the dispatching of \"thought\" and \"feeling\" etc. This is why it was advised some pages back that our upcoming Table of Correspondences, while correlating factors such as chakras and acupuncture meridians, can't be presumed to ditto the spirit by which certain of those systems are described (i.e. the \"liver\" doesn't control eyes and vision, the motor centers etc., but rather its physicalized functions, associated plexuses and subtle nerve currents transcribe, regulate and reinforce by tendency the coordinative architecture processing the \"type\" for vision, hearing, taste, touch and smell as well as the allowable range of \"motor\" activity. This implies, of course, that the chakras and nerve currents subtly ananging infrastructure variables for the \"world we know\", possess alternative potential for producing perceptions and prehensions). How The Heavenly Hypostases Match Up To Current Conditions We now see how each of the \"senses\" processes the governing typology through the radiant-fery current, mediating idea and the cohering value of identiry; through the fluid-airy current plotting pattern-networks implied in the idea; through fluid-watery current combining such net- works in stress-tensor infrastructures drawing form to the forefront; and by solid-emthy current organizing fod affinity into enforcing strucfure (reflectively identified, or \"re~onstructed'~, across the monodimensional plane of physical perception as valence-bonds for molecular combi- nation etc.). Each such current is reflected through the compound order of the physical field as, respectively, generative, respiratory, circulatory and digestive system, so that-& effect--the locus of physicality is represented in the compositelsymbolic structure of the human form as the abdomen. The \"perception\" that appears to take place through physical eyes, fleshly ears etc. is the result of the multidimensional nature-current, corresponding primarily to the vagus branch of the autonomic nerve-networks, aligning ideoform coordinates in inverse order and nesting the resuitant, composite current \"code\" as a nucleated coil proximal to the abdominaVpelvic complex. The Psychic Hypostasis, functioning through the Conscious Axis, is practically aligned"},{"pageNumber":996,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV with this kundalini coil (corresponding to a ganglionic rootcluster at the perineum) mediating autonomic and central systems; its perception of a \"physical world\" is due to its effectual functioning through the lower chah and subtle correspondents of the nerves operating the Kidney/adrend complex (the lowest or muladhara ehakra in the yogic system is, indeed, frequently ascribed to the kidneys and the adrenal glands). The Psychic Hypostasis is, as it were, slumped far down in the \"seat\" of the central axis so that it's thrust forward into conformal alignment-or \"close fit\"4th the lower extremities and abdominal complex. Sexual orientation and pressurized reference \"low\" and \"forward\", is the physiological concomitant and representation of this practical vital congruence of the Psychic Hypostasis. By contrast, the Hypostases of Noesis (Identity) and Mind remain* present 3rd density circumstances-unincamate and at a greater remove from direct alignment/functioning through autonomic loci; they remain \"above the abyss\" of rnicrocosmic/iicamative focus while functioning indirectly, through organs and plexuses of the \"physicalized\" form corresponding by current to their respective values, as monitoring agents. Mind holds out the factor of Balance to every thought and action generated through the ego-psyche; and Noesis holds out the Whole-being value of Identity as implicit standard over every act of will or desire. How Compassion Comes Filtered Through Holy Cheesecloth (Or, Why Jesus Weeps Long-distance) The indirect character of their presence and function through cerebral and cardiac centers, is evident in the practical Questionmark surrounding the reality of Spiritual themes, and in the ease with which the psychic \"ego-soul\" is able to steer the material vessel off course. At the same time another consequence of this comparatively oblique functioning, not so well known, has repercussion of a peculiar sort that makes the \"malfeasance\" of the incarnate Psyche much more a reciprocal responsibility than even \"higherdimensional\" sources are sanguine to claim: the comparative dearth of direct experience as the Mental or Noetic Hypostasis in a recalcitrant framework of function like the \"physical\", has resulted in those \"avatars\" (primarily commissioned to bring such Hypostases forward toward the physical, as Their more direct representatives) failing perennially to \"fuse\" with physical reality even when technically \"present\", in such a way that complete empathy with the physical condition has generally evaded even those expressions of the \"avatars of compassion\" etc. Therefore counsel and instruction emanating from such Sources, while at all times Worthy and Venerable in some sense owing to the sublime/sacrificial character of the agent, has not been optimaliy compatible with real requirements of the incamative frzunework. Thus we've been insufficiently prepared to accept the idea that such a hmework is experimental, changeable but according to codes of its own requirements, and that therefore the Key to the lock of physical existence doesn't exist as an infallible possession of Eternity, hovering overhead and occasionally brought down for \"our\" edification as if this were all just a littie test question for which the Guardians already have the essentially-correct answer. The conundrum of incarnate existence has all-too-often been presented in just this way, owing to the childlike character of the--quite anaclitic---~~nsciousness billeted here but owing also to the comparative unripeness of time, historically speaking--it's this same unripeness of time which accounts for the lack of empathetic correspondence in essential, harmonious congruence of Noetic"},{"pageNumber":997,"pageContent":"MATRIX N and Mental Hyposrases with the servitor centers of \"physicalizing\" expression, up till now.

Thus far this Event has been successfblly heralded by the Mother accompanied by Her functionary the Mahachohan; it remains to be seen whether avatars responsible to the Hypostases of Mind and Noesis can or will follow suit, according to the Coming Cut of the Cards. Perceiving By Heart-Beat; The Median Is The Messenger: X-tensions Of Man We may see (from diagram 3) that the Psychic Hypostasis, \"ensouling\" the vessel of the causal body as previously explained, slips forward as if conforming to the glove of a physical- abdominal \"fit\" by virtue of the extension, into vital-etheric currentpatterm, of codes configuring circulations of the breath-soul. Indeed the breath-soul, corresponding to and in proximal alignment with the heart of the physical form, has a natural pulsation; it exhibits a kind of \"systolediastole\", an expansion/con- traction or \"breathing\" in and out which is source of its ancient name. This psychic respiration or rhythmic pulse is the Eye of the \"blinking god\", i-e. the Hypostasis focused below the abyss which suffers alternate phases of relative consciousness/unconsciousness, sleep and wake. The \"blinking\" or pulsation characteristic of the causal body is a function of the essential finitude involved in the patterns of identification deposited as codes in the akashic memory-record of that \"center\". Finite forms of identification (of the type cham&nzm . . g psychic \"spells\" of incarnative focus) are necessarily contingent and variable, compound flux-states having a limited \"warranty\"; the parts tend to wear down from waking \"use\", become fatigued or fail altogether owing to complex fiction so that periodic resf replacement and renewal is called for. These alternating phases make up incarnative interwals where the identification-pattern are periodically \"put to sleep\", refreshed and renewed according to fruitfi~I recombination of their parts. Such soul-intervals are paralleled in physical incarnation by phases of waking, dreaming and dreamless sleep. The soul-body mediates all such cycles and patterns. Thus its pulsatory \"respiration\", the breathing-pattern or heartbeat of its form comprises a kind of trans-temporal periodicity; its breathing in and out generates the circulating streams andpranic-flowchannels awakening, unfold- ing and aligning all the enfolded seed codes patterning nature-fields as functions of the (governing) ideotype. In diagram 3 the coordinative codes of the breath-soul are depicted as emanating-out and informing the vitalletheric field, in alignment rotations that effectively invert the natural order subtly enfolding the etheric systems. This virtual eversion of the order within the physical breathstream places the structuring phase in practical ascendancy, as we've seen, and accounts for the lockin nucleation of invaginated \"turns\" in the etheric spiral as if a ghost sheath curled up, insideout, within the primary pattern and settled into mirroring fixity at its root From the etheric root and repository of these impressions (called kundalini), the b-guide and are guided by the prevailing typology into a configurative consistency representing a \"vital-physical world\" through stylized perceptual apparatus.

Thus the ego-soul (Psychic Hypostasis) aligned with the conscious channel according to focal triangulations of the causal body, receives sensory impressions of its own keyed-in alignment typology throughfunctiond integration at the abdominal locus, where the composite result of etheric-current activity transmits an aggregate impression to the informing breath soul (causal body). It is the configurative pattern of the causal body which is actually \"seen\" when physical manifestation is experienced. Since the causal body or breath-soul is essentially the same as Castaneda's Assemblage Point it may be inferred from principles of the aforesaid material that an induced change in etheric-current patterning (due to cognitive \"escape clauses\" in the typology taken advantage of by the ego-soul etc.) would be received by a parallel shift in coordinative alignments of the breath-sod. In fact this is the case. Yogic vision registers this overall coordinative shift or modification in codes of the causal body as an illdon, or change in radiant ratios, of its projective \"centers\" or astraYetheric chakras. The Castaneda material, reporting from vantage of a different \"style\" of alignment than that of the conventional yogas, describes such a shift in coordinative current-ratios as an apparent displacement of the relative \"position\" of the causal body itself with respect to its physical counterpart. Psyche's Place In The Circuit, As Emissary Of The Transcendental Hypostases (Who Hang Out 44Above\" The Whole Scene Making Rude Remarks) Psyche is illumined to varying degrees in its attention through activation of the breath- soul, kept churning from impressions aligned with vital-etheric current activity (itself processing perceptions and cognitions according to typal consistencies projected by pranas from the causal vehicle). From diagram 3, we see how a multidimensional circuit is maintained in this manner. The etheric nucleus (kundalini-coil) summing and stabilizing autonomic current-pat- terns, is impressed like a wax seal from psycho-active values organizing its configuration space out of coded contents of the breath-soul-floating, like the proverbial mind-borne lotus, on the murky lake of the \"astral\". The perceptual content thus aligned to its \"solid\" value through common inversion-ingress of the kundalini nucleus, is never a raw representation of \"some- out there\" but is necessarily endued with sufficient significance to quaIifL as \"psychic\" impression in the first place owing to the affective and associative charge it necessarily bears (as product of processes primed by types of identity-orientation, idbed with committed light-value). Such charged impressions, received through summary \"kunlialini\" code (correspond- ing, in the invaginated and \"exteriorized\" representation of the physical form, with cerebellum and medullary centers) convey potential meaning to the Psyche through stimulus of the informing breath-soul. 983"},{"pageNumber":999,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Although, as with the conventional biomedical model such impressions seem \"pas- sively\" received, there remains on the metaphysical model a countercharged \"jot\" of volitional presence in all such perceptuaycognitive registry. The point of contact/transition between autonomic currents of vital processing and the causal vessel, occurs on the \"exterior\" map at the abdominal locus; the major key produced by receptive \"indwelling\" of the vital-physical centers causes the Psyche to recline amidst a largely subliminal processing, while the minor key spillover of attention hm more active enjoyments maintains a murmuring \"boil\" of pre-conscious alertness, a submerged periscope of will amidst the miscellaneous mackerel trawled by mindlbody net of the subconscious currents. From this flip-flop- ping bounty of impressions the minor key presence of will continuously sifts and sorts, inclined to the iridescence of one \"species\" of impression and pushed hm another. When a particular, \"bidding\" impression attracts an adequate interest-level of Identity, attention grabs it by its thrashing \"tail\"; the subliminal churning in the abdominal net produces a sufficient quickening of light value, kindling some central soul-of-identity through will, that the ratios of passive-to-active components in the brooding thought process undergo an interchange. As the preferred impression associatively suggests an active line of thinking, it consoli- dates into a thought fype possessing some threshold measure of central significance to the regnant identity-value. Along with related feelings, emotions, desires and the implied background of symbolic links the quality of thought, buoyed by the proportional injection of active will, seems \"fished up\" out of the general abdominal reservoir of churning impressions and is landed onto the \"deck\" of the causal vessel.

At the causal locus of the heart, Psyche nurtures its cluster of seed-ideas (coded with characteristic impress of basic identity-value), quickens them to proportionally active magnitudes of meaning and purpose and in this manner further engages nature processes of the breath-soul in engraving coordinative keys and dimensional tracks corresponding to psycho-magnetic linkages or latent lockups.

Correlation Of Currents, Centers And Systems In Compositing The Flat Physique; How Lovely Lights Become A Carnal Lump (Or, Where \"Before\" Looks Decidedly Better Than \"Aphtha\") So far we've seen the way processes of perception, thinking, emotionality and memory, conventionally ascribed to events transpiring in the brain, are the result meta-physically of a subtle life-current engaging each aspect through a discrete \"plane\" and pranic grade, producing a composite apparently arising across a uniform field. We may better understand the correlations from the physicalized \"cartoon\", on the homunculus model. We know from modern neuroscience as well as acupuncturederived disciplines gaining currency in the West, that zones of the brain4 or instance--map the extended human form across the cortex; that the ears, fingers, feet and genitals as well as other areas not so anatomically defined configure microcosms of the whole. Findings on the brain, in particular, \"officially\" sand@ the Southern Crown habit of pointing up parallels between gnomon strata of the organ and the physical structure in toto. The cortex, as most mame cephalic representation may stand for the brain-mind as a whole; the limbic systemhidbrain corresponds, analogically and structurally, to the thoracic region of the mindhdy pattern; and the medullary/cefebellar loci parallel, in position and function, the abdominal/pelvic zones of the body in extenso. Thus when we describe, tbrough Initiated report, the efficient imagination of striate current-patterns processing contributive values through the multidimensional complex, we're narrating the assemblage of a qualitative efect. We're describing the interaction of currents which in themselves are constants of any such physicalizing focus, but which in the modeling case of 3rd density resolution exhibit characteristic ratios and mws of emphasis assigning values to variable terms. Thus the currents borne by abstract-ideative impulsive technically responsible for the typology of the whole, are efficiently subordinated (in terms of aggregate efect) to patterning processes of the succeeding current-issue4.e. the general mentalfiamework absorbing the idem- type. Mind-modulations in the coordinative keys of that current become subordinated, in tum, to the affective values forming psycho-active flowlines of the pattern; and that formative issue is sublimated pari passu to its technical successor, so that sequencing keys and defining cycles (encoding structural consistencies for \"vehicularizing\" affective elements) are locked into chemical rivulets conformally adhering to topological curves of the memory-banks.

The patterning value of the processing currents corresponds to the temporal portion of the brain, and by extension the respiratory system of the mind/body fom. An Amplification On \"Breath\" Respiration with its variable rates, rhythms and ratios (CO, to 0, etc.) patterns the aggregate influence or mental disposition for affective processing/interpretation of sensequalities and associations; it gives the gestalt of elements \"metabolizing\" the network of impressions according to the mental matrix, interpretive of the ideotype. The sensequalities (associated in their patterning stage with the temporal lobes) are-* we've seen-variably composed functions of the presiding ideotype; therefore the metabolic medium through and as which they're processed, regulated by interactive breath-currents epito- mized in signature rhythms of thepbsical breath, enacts the aggregate mental \"take\" on that type, determinative of the cognitive value as which the sense impression will be received. We know for instance that our mental cfisposition influences our overall feeling, which may be clinically indexed in the breathing pattern (panic and hyperventilation are the most obvious examples). Breathing, owing to its fundamental processing of life-current properties (pH levels etc.) is the biophysical function instrumental in ordering and monitoring the overall efficiency of the life systems. According to the relative efficiency of that processing pattern keyed by mental disposi- tions, perception will comport variable tendencies of response and reaction \"as if\" the objects of perception contained these qualities in their own right (rather than as a range ofpotential, specifically elicited according to the presiding gestalt of mind/body perceptual patterning). Thus with a preponderantly \"acidic\" constitution owing to relative metabolic imbalance, we may \"perceive\" a particular sound as unusually appealing, even appetitively necessary as if a tonal craving corre- sponded to some \"food\" for our disturbed digestive requirements; or the sight of some object, usually innocuous or \"neutral\", suddenly engenders nausea owing to the interpretive \"tint\" of its perceived hue etc. The respiratory system, ordinarily considered a &ctly autonomic function, is nonethe- less the subconscious process most directly regulable by will; it is the most immediately amenable to overt mental direction. Such linkage points to its equation with the patterning value of Mind. Not only does it faithfully correspond to the patterning \"grasp\" or aggregate determination of mind as an autonomic function; it submits that function most directly to the self-conscious desideration of Mind, as when we will to mod@ or hold the breath.

This is in fact the case, as we shall see. Indeed according to our characterization of the brain-body model as a compressive, monoplane representation of the multidimensional mindbody current process, we should expect to find all the strata and functions effectively \"invaginated\" therein (so as to produce the aggregate material impression) suitably represented and recapitulated in the micro-anatomy of the physical form, and its homunculus the physical brain. This proves to be the case; drawing on most recent findings of biochemists, neuro-anato- mists and other scientific types converting simian sacrifice to isotopic tracery and biopsy panel, we find a suggestively parallel \"route\" mapped through byways of the brain. A Deft Adeptus Adaptation Of New Exoteric Findings To Old Esoteric Windings (A) First stage in the processing of perceptions is the striate (vimat') cortex. The perception arises as rudimenta~~ impression, giving for example no more than the position and general orientation of a line. This reflects, in compound physical terms, the actual point-of-origina- tion through the vertical axis, in the radiant-fiery breath current conveying value of the ideow. The impression processed by the striate cortex is at its optimum abstraction as a unific, coherent generality (this is of course in relation to values Iposition, angle etc.] belonging to \"succeeding\" states of the pa#erain% current energy4ut we must recall, we're viewing the process \"hm the bottom of the well\", so to speak, giving us its reflection au rebours as fhr as the derivative brain-map is concerned). The striate cortex traces an anatomical route to the posterior parietal cortex, responsible for registering spatial information; spatial relationships are analytically processed along that route. \"Spatial relationships\" are, of course, characteristic of the most abstradideofo values, given the elements of structure and fonn being processed. The posterior parietal cortex transmits information to the principal sulm (furrow in the brain convolutions) of the prefiontal cortex (see 0. The hippocamp (also C) is COM~C~~ to the posterior parietal cortex by a spatiallydiscriminative function. So far, then, we see that the posterior-parietal and visual cortices along with their characteristic functions correspond quite reasonably, in their reflective and secondary descriptions, to attributes assigned the radiant-fiev current by initiated report-correlated with etheric paths of the generative system (pineal gland and gonads, nerve-networks); with the faculty of vision and the organ of the eye; and with the noetic value of the ideotpe. (B) Second stage in the processing of perceptions (in terms of the monoplane composite) is located through the inferior temporal lobes; this is where, biomedically, the aggregate pattern of the impressions is organized. By anatomical location, the lobes are associated with the ears; esoterically, \"sound\" is recognized as embodying the principle whereby pattern emerges fiom ordering numen of the ideotype. Since the physical structure of things is organized as the \"reflection at the bottom of the well\", the material lobes are identified in all sense-organ patterning--the principle esoterically ascribed to \"sound\" is perceived to participate in memories and associations involving vision, hearing, taste and smell."},{"pageNumber":1003,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Any of the senses may be disturbed by abnormal electrical discharges in temporal-lobe epilepsy. Such pathology indeed serves to disrupt the \"physicaiizing\" order of interaction in the pattern-directives, so that intimations of informing processes (reflexively represented by the lobes et al.) are given by inference in the dreamlike.states and splices of de'ja vu that invade the reality-hework of the percipient. Properly interpreted, the dreaminess or stuttering \"repetition\" of an event is sign of the disruptive intersection fiom the physical focus of consciousness, upon the twilight states and pre-conscious processes actually taking place transdimensionally along the vertical axis and-usually--only intercepted in composite physical format Activity in the processing of sense-information through the inferior temporal lobes, corresponds by physical reflection to thepuid-airy current of the vital field; the etheric precursors of auditory faculty and otic organ, operating subtle nerves and plexifom pathways of the respiratory system; and the patterning value of mind. (C) Third stage in perceptual processing focuses4 terms of the monoplane compos- ite-on the limbic system or \"-midbrainw and that posterior forebrain subdivision known as the diencephalon. The diencephalon is composed of thalamus and hypothalamus. The thalamus is in turn a paired structure of ovoid organs comprising the greater part of the lateral walls belonging to the third ventricle. It acts as a central relay station for signals sent along primary sensory-path- ways, distributing them to specialized receival centers in the cortical area The various sensory signals laterally connect to the reticular formation of the midbrain and brainstem enroute to the thalamus, contributing impressional modifications to its arousal level. The brainstem regulates electrical activity governing the degree and intensity of attention, the quality of awareness and the gradations between wake and sleep. An associated function of the thalamus furnishing non-specialized passage to the cortical areas, is that of the dzme thalamic projection system active in immediate fluxes of focus, in degree, quality and intensity of attention etc. At the reflective level of physical representation, the brainstem itself is structural testament to the meta-physical idea that the organs of perception are processed through, and are regulative of, the patterning agencies of the etheric-nerve currents infonningthe autonomic systems. The reticular formation is known biomedically as a kind of black box, receiving autonomic nerve networks through one end and sensory projections through the other; though physical science appends a questionmark to the occasion, it's diagrammatic of a relational fact. The hpothalamus portion of the diencephaion is associated with the autonomic nervous system (e.g. as a lobe or electrochemical complex mediating emotions of fear and anger) and contributes a regulative function toward various internal processes including those that govern wake and sleep. Nuclei in the thalamus associated with limbic structures pass fibers to the anterior portion of the fiontal lobe known as the ventromedial prej?ontal cortex; the sulcul areas of the prehntal zone are linked with the hippocampus of the limbic system, responsible in part for consolidating ongoing associative networks of affective impression processed by the ventromedial cortex. This prefiontal zone acts as common receptor and synthetic agent coordinating the ensembles of associations, basically through a system of inhibitory controls, unifying their contributions fiom the sections in which they're formed. Sulcul areas of the prefiontal cortex are linked as well, through the hippocampus, to the posterior parietal cortex (see A) responsible for processing spatial information of the sensory impressions; the hippocampus furthers the parietal function as a discriminator of spatial relation-"},{"pageNumber":1004,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV ships, as in the fixing or comparative location of objects. It processes information of the inferior temporal lobes (see B) as flective response-pattern; it's responsible for integrating the received impressions in terms of interpreted emotional value, imparting the unifj4ng psychic charge of \"affinity\" (e.g. assigning variable values of attraetion/repulsion, associative pleasure or pain, of comparative like and dislike). As a locus of spatial discmum& . . 'on (in determining coordinative orientation of objects etc.) the affective agency of the hypothalamus gives that operation as an instance in the function of selective recognition. We may say that, carrying forward the primacy of the Conscious magnitude fiom the vertical axis, evidence at the reflected \"physical\" level testifies according to its character as to the actual inexistence of mechanically-behavioral or objectively indifferent processes of perceptual registry; such taken-for-granted functions as the way we scan, perceive and identify a given object in the room, are organized on purely psychic grounds. Each such act is charged with @zed potential constituting the whole focus of activity as a sentient and willed operation, a disrriminative grid of feeling and emotionally meaningful differentiations. Asurcharge On The Axcess Of Hypo-thelemic Action Just as the hippocampus processes sensory impressions in terms of emotional response, we've seen the way in which the hypothalamus (regulating glandular activities through the pituitary) assigns response-governing emotional value to sensory inputs. It's here that the linkage of the hypothalamus to the sympathetic portion of the autonomic nerve networks through messenger hokons, keyed by interpretive response to sense impressions, @lays the reflection of processes conducted through subtle currents of the vertical axis upon the \"horizontal\" plane of stylized physical representation. Thejluid-watev current of the subtle system, mediating the faculty of taste and organ of the tongue, processes that phase of the informing ideotype organizing values of its aflned or psycho-emotional potential (tendencies of empathetic correspondence, \"tastes\" of pleasing and displeasing qualities etc.), and contributes to its overall consolidation as mnemonic impression. It im~artspsy&ic coherence to the general pattern, according to orientational identity-values carried in the type (i.e. those \"instructions\" requiring inertial and resistive fonns of \"physirali7ed\" perception identifying with bodily being, effdvely subordinating noetic structuring process et al.). It functions principally through the circulatory system and its innervating plexuses (physically interpreted), in conjunction with the respiratory system and related of the fluid-aiv current. Involvement of the representative 'physical\" stmctwe-hypothalarnus-with func- tions regulating hunger and thirst etc. indicates correspondence and symbolic parallelism in the affined proc.esses of physical and emotional appetite, psychic and somatic desires, cravings, attractions and aversions. Indeed the \"hypothalamus\" may be considered fleshy-tissue token of our observations above, regarding the unity of symbolic and instrumental prehensions, the immediacy of metaphoric value given through the quality of any \"object\" (as wh&we may compare a person's mind with a sieve). The amyg&la of the limbic system functions as switchboard of the nerve-circuits, connecting by reciprocal paths to all the senses; nuclei of the amygdala project fibrous reticulations to the hypothalamus, thus linking the complex of senses to systems interpretively integrating both discrete and aggregate impressions through psycho-active values."},{"pageNumber":1005,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV According to regulatory biochemistry of the system corresponding to emotional quality and level (serotonin, dopamine etc.) the hypothalamus acts through releasing-factor hormones on the pituitary in production of adrenocorticotropic hormone, stimulating production of hydmcorti- sone in the adrenal cortex (seated athwart the kidneys) and modulating epinephrinehorepinephrine levels. The kidneys and adrenals are associated esoterically with the \"lower\" chakms of muladhara and svadisthana, through which the Psychic Hypostasis is given to integrate and \"residentially\" function, in forward displacementlextension from its resolution zone of the conscious or cerebro- spinal channel. Thus the Psychic Hypostasis corresponding to the Fom World (and \"astral\" plane), is reflected in formative cunrents of the etheric network regulating processes \"physically\" projected around activities of circulatory and limbic systems, mediated by hpothalamus governing sympa- thetic responsepatterns focused through kidneys/adrenals which are...p hysical loci of the subtle plexuses housing the Psychic Hypostasis. The stress of such psychic focus and coordinating activity (\"ego\" as organiiwional instrument) with respect to organs and systems chiefly associated with the sympathetic nerve-net- work, indicates a characteristic emphasis setting operative ratios in the proportional interaction of sympathetidparasympathetic systems. Since the parasympathetic branch innervates deep viscera conducting ruminative proc- esses of digestion presided over by the cholingeric system, it's chiefly sedative; it is thus closest, in tern of autonomic functioning, to the more tranquil or sattvic, balanced spirit of the central nervous system (-mm). Proportional emphasis and preferential, smctural connection between the Psychic Hypostasis of the conscious axis and the sympathetic or excitatory nerve networks, gives the preponderant emotional balance characterizing projection of the ego-psyche into physicalized expression. It shows that, in its present state it is not optimally structured for conducting ratios of autonomic interaction fborable to more direct alignment and harmonic self-congruence with the Conscious Axis. Rather than exhibiting preferential ratios of alignment through afferent currents medi- ating deep processes and tranquil states of the mind/body form, the clear structural emphasis favors efferent flows of the fightlflight alert system dilating capillaries of the muscle and surhce tissues, while constricting vascular networks of the deep organs. This produces a consistent \"pressure\" of surface displacement, as if \"leaning forward\" anxiously into the perceptual zone of projective and symbolically-mediated experience. It's for this reason that yogic processes of relaxation, deep breathing and redirection of attention \"inward\", are implemented; they establish a counter-conduc- tivity tending to alter the autonomic ratios of interaction in favor of theparasympathetic, correcting for the psychic \"parallax\" of bifurcatm%/outward two-eyed orientation and serving to resolve such tension through unitive common denominator of the central channel. A Trained See-horse From The Hypno-Campus: Riding The Nag Of Negation Through The Caliente Gates Note that the amygdala itself, transmitting general sensory input to the hypothalamus, is fomator of positive associations. Thus it tends to submit a primary, positive impressional organization to a lobe serving a principal function of negation. The value of negation, derived from void-being and integrated preferentially by structure through the brain-mind system (see Logos/Anti-Logos II) is itself valid and indeed indispensable."},{"pageNumber":1006,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Its agency is located preponderantly in lefi-brain functions of cognitive and verbal abstraction, the disruptively reordering artifice of linearity, the faculty of divisive \"distancing\" etc. The \"working memory\" of theprefi.onta1 cortex, chiefly responsible for the objectively focused ego-presentations we largely identify as \"one another\", was described as an associative complex operated through mediation of assorted inhibitory controls. Such inhibitory controls are operatives of the principle of \"negation\", and are therefore self-evidently quite useful. The prehntal cortex is the immediate \"I\" that coordinates elements of associative, psycho-sensory synthesis hm other zones of the brain, employing them as symbolic information for short-term behavioral adaptations and ad hoc relearning; it functions admirably through negation processes of the void-variable (\"chaotically\" presiding over all such patterning functions) forming and reforming by spontaneous tailoring of behavior to knowledge, concretely acting--by regulation of motor functions through the principal sulcu.s---on abstract concepts, through thetic modalities of planning, anticipating etc. with respect to the temporalized negation of \"future\" and with reference to the nugatory tense of the \"past\". As the agent of symbolic information and representative modes of knowledge, as well as anticipatory actions (such as turning one's back to run for a struck ball, in the direction one expects it to drop) the prehntal cortex exemplifies the psychic employment of the principle of negation in modeling affective cognitions and behaviors. (Indeed, properly understood, this practical operative of the principle of negation shows why we're not b'robots\" of mechanistic behaviorism.) Though such functions serve, they may be overemphasized and given organizational \"lead\", as they are in the general enculturated case. As we've seen, the hypothalamus intercepts first positive impressions as praetorian guard and vigilant veto, thereby assigning clear priorities. The hippocampus, which serves to carve the psychic space of our sense perceptions, does so characteristically through operations of negative reinforcement. Indeed its spatially discriminative faculty is at the root of that-thetic-division between \"internal\" and \"external\" space giving orientational charge to the primary polarization \"self\"/\"not self\". It's symbolically appropriate that the hippocampus is, in shape, like the \"seahorse\" fkom which it takes its greco-medical name. Just as the figure of the seahorse curls into a contractile kind of questionmark, so the existential \"doubt\" introduced through the hippocampus serves the figurative and somatic contractions manifesting as self-recoiling of the ego-self, and translated repercussively in terms of coiled kundalini reflected right down to the energy-spring of ATP molecule, the knots of body-armor and subtle constrictions of the chakra centers.

Down Memory Lane @) Fourth stage in perceptual processing focuses on the basal forebrain, cerebellum and medullary centers. First of all it's important to note that this system of mind-brain loci corresponds (by coordinative inversion of hierarchic current-principles toward the composite field of physical focus) to the earthy-solid stream of the vitaVetheric breath current. The earthy-solid flow-field is the modified phase in the overall noesis of the vital ethers correlated with the principle of structure."},{"pageNumber":1007,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"Structure\" signifies the process which translates copenetrant field geometries through their most stable, \"polyhedral\" extension (emblemized in sacred geometry by the furthest exteri- orization of the dodecahedron, as nearest rectilinear approximation to the initiating sphere fiom which the five special \"solids\" are sprung); the abstract coordinates of this pre-patterned phase space give the specific stress-tensor gradients generating \"energy-dynamics\" in the fom of characteristic complementary forces, serving to lock in affined potentials coded throughprana-ized hfktmcture geometries of the fluid-watery current phase etc. This lock-in is the regulatory stabilization of a cyclic or mutually-reinforcing pattern of persisting repetitions (e.g. \"far from equilibrium\"), giving the habituated feeling of reliable consistency and relative predictability. As such, it's a consolidative stage in the overall processes of memory, itself pervading every state and level of the mind-body whole. In this sense it apotheosizes the function of memory, as if we could view this phase in the projective synthesis of the physical field as uniquely belonging to and embodying \"memory\"--even though as a function it appears at corresponding levels of cunent-process through each of the planes and worlds. The basal forebrain is, therefore, first of all associated with the stage mnemonically encoding and consenring the foregoing stages in the ordering of sensory-motor impressions. It's chiefly identified with secretion of a neurotransmitter that infiuences the structural order of synapses, crystallizing the product of infeeding activities as memory pattern through sensory-cir- cuits of the cortex. Such circuits act as guideline-tendencies thread@ the coordinative interplay of ongoing perceptual processes; multidimensionally-i.e. if we separated-out this composite, physically representative picture into its component \"etheric\" elements-we'd find this to be an analog of the coded kunddini-lockin at the energy-nucleus parallel the perineum, comprising the matrix mem- ory-impression transcribing and \"reporting back\" to aggregate mnemonic marks in the akashic space of the breath-soul, and serving as regulatory tendency in the variable interaction of infeeding breath-currents. Tracing the processes strictly according to their physical representation and monoplane \"summary\", we may identify the memory-impressions guidmg ongoing activitylresponse as structures of perceptual tendency infused with affective value, being both product of, and subject to, varying psychic interpretation. Owing to the fact that specific ontological values common to the field-of-being are encoded through all such ideofom variables, the latitude of psychic interpretation actually embedded in perceptual experience can never warrant the bumptious dictum \"you create your own reality\", as we've thoroughly shown by now. The actual processes giving rise to potential mis-perceptions typical of that half-truth, should be apparent to the careful reader. Acefyicholine is a neurotransmitter found throughout the nervous-system, and concen- trated particularly at neuromuscular junctions (serving the memoly-functions of activity-aote that Mallcuth of Assiah in the Qabaliic system, the ultimate outcropping of mnemonic process, is called Action). It's a chemical of the cholingeric system. Just as corticotropic hormones and the adrenalines were associated with activity of the ~ympathetic nervous system, so the neurotransmitter acetyl- choline and the cholingeric chemistries are associated with the parasympathetic. Recall that the parasympathetic system, through its characteristic neurotransmitter, is the \"sedative\" branch of the autonomic nerve networks chiefly involved in the dilation of deep blood vessels optimizing digestive activities of the abdominal plexuses and organs. Its comparatively relaxative influence, inclines parasympathetic activity toward the tranquil equipoise characteristic of self-congruent alignment"},{"pageNumber":1008,"pageContent":"through the conscious axis. Proportional emphasis on the parasympathetic nerve-network is sine qua non of higher- dimensional awakening, which takes place only through threshold intensities of psychic alignment with the central nervous system, or Conscious channel. The fact of the cholingeric system operating memory-functions of the basal forebrain, illustrates first of all the intimate link between this synaptically smcturing phase (engraving sensory-impression as mnemonic tendency) and the attribution of its corresponding earthy-solid \"breath\" to the digestive cmnt system; and it suggests as well the deep, \"meditative\" or comparatively tranquil phases of mind/body process such as rest and sleep that are necessary for the consolidation of memory-impressions. It's well known that excessive sympathetic activity impairs the processes of long-term memory formation .and retention; it should be apparent by inference that meditative states and spiritual practices serving higherldeeper alignment through the conscious channel, depending as they do upon a ratio proportionally favoring parasympathetic dominance, are by that token conducive to intensified degrees of memory-integration--5211d, that such memory integration is itself a hallmark and function of the deeper mind/body field-coherence productive of both conventional and spiritual genius (i-e. the power to perceive beyond the norm, and to exist beyond the norm). A specific structural complex of the basal forebrain possessing webs of sensory-motor fibers known as the striatum, has been modeled biomedically as likely neural locus for the formation of habit-patterns. Habit patterns are of course abstractly compound, reflex behavioral memories just as recollected sights or sounds are abstractly simple cognitive memories. And The \"Hand That Rocks The Cradle Award\": To Those Legions Of Behaviorists Who've Manful& Labored To Determine Over The Years, Regardless The Cost To Specimens, \"What's Love Got To Do With It\".,. The basal brain stmchm above the medulla oblongata known as the cerebellum, is physically associated with the coordination of sensory inputs to complex muscular response-pat- terns. (Here too we understand the designation of the field of Assiah and its corresponding sphere Malkurh, ascribed to the basal brain centers and abdominal/digestive loci, as the World of Action). The cerebellum is a principal stratum of the mind-brain, operative--and emphasized--during infancy and early childhood. In physical terms, this zone of the mind-brain is chronologically kt to be developed, but is not (as some commentators have it) the first to be activated. All the strata, lobes, levels and \"planes\" of the mind-brain are present and active through thepre-natal \"breath\", much less the moment intake of the vital-physical breath occurs. It's just that the cortical and mid-brain components are subordinated, in manifestation of characteristic activities, in service of the early vital-learning functions associated with instinctual reservoirs of the hindbrain/lower abdominal centers (and parallel svadisthana-muladhara chakras). Indeed this orientational downflow of operative strata in deferential reference toward the vital functions is conserved throughout development, and characterizes polarization-alignment of the spiritually \"masked\" 3rd density field altogether. Emotions and the power of conceptualizing are put in service of survivalist drives and reproductive imperatives, even if those imperatives are subsequently disguised through the more abstract, mnemonic self-reproduction and survivalism of"},{"pageNumber":1009,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the ego-ideal. Owing to cerebellar involvement in learning associated with sensory-motor coordina- tions, and in light of its functional emphasis in infancy, \"findings\" of the antiseptic sciencelab reiterating what's ever known by natural maternity are understandable: early deprivation of contact, caress, varied movement etc. is positively related to poor adaptation in terms of both physical and emotional growth. As any real parent might have informed the medical minions carefully stunting growth and thwarting life in a plastic cage, simple actions of nurture, of touch or comforting tone, of rocking or swinging impart to infant consciousness the indispensable love and enveloping caress-of-being comprising confident transmission underwriting every success in adaptive orienta- tion, vital-bearing and relational mastery. Demonstrable stimulation of or feedback through the cognitive and emotional centers, testifies to their unitive participation-md the requirement to represent or sponsor them in behavioral parallels--even at the early \"medullary\" or \"hindbrain\" stages of development. Moving Through e-Motions; Meaning Of The Molecular Dugpa-mean* The so-called pleasure centers (anterior hypothalamus, septal structures of the limbic system etc--see C) respond to the comparative attention or deprivation accorded the \"lower\" centers (which encode the vital-patterns comprising built-in desire tracks, and the innate drive to exercise ideoform life-tendencies toward m- behavioral orders and coherencies of per- tion). The caudate nucleus of the forebrain under the cerebral folds, is also involved in coordination, initiation of movement etc. Dopamine, the neurotransmitter of the caudate nucleus, stimulates its function from the substantia nigra in the basal brain. Deprivation of dopamine (e.g. due to neuronal deficiency in the substantia nigra) is causally related to Parkinson's (a disease of motional impairment). Conversely, a chemical excess of dopamine is causally connected to schizophrenic symptoms; significantly, schizophrenia is marked by severe paranoia and fear, by anxiety and painful cognitions, contractile response-patterns and so forth. (Indeed modern case histories of schizophrenia and its variations the \"multiple-personality disorder\" etc., inevitably show early abuse, childhood traumas, deprivation or parental impairment of some type.) Psycho-emotional coordination of movements focused through these \"early\" sub-cere- bra1 zones, is therefore represented in the presence of a chemical molecule the operative balance of which inversely effects conditions of motion (Parkinson's) and emotion (schizophrenia). It should be noted that, contrary to earlier biomedical models, it's not a \"content-carrying\" function of the biochemistry but a shucmral function of the dopamine molecule which serves to account for its * The obscurity of the pun here forces another belaboring of a slight witticism, rationalizing that any deeper insight imparted thereby may offset so excruciatingly earnest an exercise.

Only if the \"content\" of the molecule were significant in terms of \"information\", would the inverse relation characterizing its comparative contexhrPI benefit remain a puzzle. As signal stimulatorltransmitter, \"dopamine\" simply conveys-ad indeed em- blemizes--the existence of an operative interrelationship between categorically discreted functions, so that \"physical\" and \"psychic\" orientations can't be taken as expressions of a Cartesian dualism at the structural level; it is, in its reflective physical terms, a fimction of the tattvas or elemental flows of balance. If \"content\" were somehow carried in the biochemistry like bookpages in a library rather than manifesting as the variable resultant of structural alignments (e.g. as letters the presencesr-absence of which give the conditions for forming different words), the absurdity of some inflexible reciprocity between mental health and physical coordination owing to the invariance of \"message content\" would have to be contemplated, the two \"symptoms\" would invariably be coupled by a smooth transposition of operators and would occur together every bit as much as salubrious mental and coordinative-physical adjustment went together. Krishnamurthi, for example, would also have to be a schizophrenic.* Willing The MindIBrain Pain Drain The respective (motional and emotional) systems are specifically linked, as noted, in the cross-correlation between cerebellar centers and medullary functions, and the zones of pleasurelpain in the midbrain limbic system. The key regulatory functions focused physically through the hypothalamur~ovemhg hormonal flow of the pituitay-along with the reticular formation serving to adjust metabolic balances in temperature and appetite, degrees of waking, sleeping and levels of awareness, suggests how hdamentally important are the formative factors of vital-stimu- lation, love response and afktional care in the aggregate \"positive\" or \"negative\" influence over psychic organization. It indicates how signrficant are such values relative to the resultant optimum of mind/body integral harmony and happy adjustment; for the hypothalamus is itself divided into anterior and posterior sites of pleasure and of pain, respectively (we've already seen the way in which \"positive\" information is submitted for monitoring to the \"negative\" regulator of the hypothalamus). At the same time, the associative activity of the hippocampus links that lobe to the formation of long-term memory patterns (constituting features of an overall identification-index, in that \"who you are\" is a function of preferred repetitions and reinforcements laying more durable sets of tracks); the depth, growth and mnemonic enrichment of regulatory functions implied in that activity, and indicated by participation of the cholingeric system-associated with tranquil states - * The existence of the letters G-0-D and the letters PO4 demonstrates the common presence of the English alphabet, and its requirement for their respective spelling; but it doesn't imply an insauction for assembling the one out of the other.

Again: a jet Wine and the fuselage of an aircraft are certainly united, slruchnally, by the rivets holding the latter in place; yet the laxity of a workman leaving a bucket of bolts in the exhaust is bound to cause a malfunction of flring--nor does such a turbojet malfunction owing to the inappropriate presence of rivets in the one instance, imply a corresponding absence of bolts in the fuselage so that the craft flies apart at the seams simultaneously."},{"pageNumber":1011,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of the parasympathetic complex--in structural coding of memory synapses seems haunted by the lowering shadow of a shiftable \"ceiling\", since the hippocampus is largely hown as an organiza- tional locus idenwing conditions of deprivation orpain (as is the amygdala--see C). This seems to tell us what types of formative experience tend to impress us most by conservation as long-term memory pattern, in our current 3rd stage condition of mind/body alignment-yet the \"evidence\" of such effect needn't be taken as any more permanent description of an immutable objective fact than the currently \"fixed\" notion that this is an inevitably entropic universe. Indeed it's just another example of functional emphasis, and of the variable \"charge\" assigned the central value of Will in its coinherence through relatively active or relatively passive phases (as with the reversible countercharges of the Wu-Wei symbol). Referring to the more extensive description given in Logos/Anti-Logos Part II, we find that the initial \"positive\" registry of perceptual information+orresponding to anterior sites of the hypothalamus, e.g.-relates to the essential self-identity as which all phenomenological content is indiscriminately given, in its existential immediacy (most purely exemplified in infant consciousness); the submission of all such \"positive\" input to the negative monitorjposterior hypothalamus, e.g.4~ simply expression of the irreducible void factor of being separated-out into specificfi~~:tionai stress as a reflexively inhibitory and \"negating\" watchdog of secondary, survivalist factors attaching to the positional state of contingent instrumentality (cf. the work of hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex et al.). The function itself is perfectly legitimate. Its relative emphasis in engagement of the principal, \"active\" charge of will at passive levels, serves a balance which becomes \"negative\" by inflection, overwhelming and burying the positive immediacy and self-identity of being so that an operative ceiling is placed upon the overall memory-function and thus the governing degree of mind/body integration etc. Relative settling of the kundalini monitor parallel the sacrum, gives the concentrated (or inversely-nucleated) case of the extended etheric currents processing psycho-active energy hierar- chies as mattes of \"material\" perception. Its minoring coil sets required correlations for a multidimensional current-pattern, focusing a Through-the-Looking-glass style of self-apprehension (namely the fleshly features we iden* as the objective case, rendering glowing clusters and electric geometries of its own subtle network as an ovoid mass of pulpy convolutions housed in a calcium crate) at the same time determinative, by just that token, of the relative proportions and emphases mapped into the operative flow-lines of the physical assemblage. Kundalini configures the efficient condition, through its transdimensional turns, for the adjustive adaptation to spacetime \"norms\" established through medullary and abdominal centers at correlated points of the mind/body vehicle (in telescoped physical signatures). Fixation of the focal field in terms of material spacetime according to enculturation processes, takes place through that very polarized correspondence between the subtle nuclear regulator at the sacnun, and the cerebellar or deep-brain strata enlisting the allegiance--and influencing orientational direction-of the \"superior\" psychic correlatives of midbrain and cortex. Subtle locus of the \"serpent-fire\" sums a complex weave of internested ethers repre- senting emanative functions of one another and encoding the coordinative composite, while serving to hold it \"in place\". Such etheric linkages regulate perceptual, cognitive and psycho-active keys, adjusting ideoform modes of self-symbolization with behaviors reliably related to a developed-if reflectively abstracted-pleasure index.

Recall the radiant ideofonn Light pattern is involved in the deep nuclear core of the kundalini coil, and is correlated with the physical mechanism of hypothalamus/pinedpituitary so that disturbance or dislocation of the encoded typal patterning-index of the kundalini regulator for the multidimensional coil immediately disturbs the relation between the etheric processing currents of perception and of cognition (associated with the noetic-generative [ideative], mental-respiratory Cpatteming], psychic-circulatory [formative] and physicaldigestive [structural] fields organizing and setting ratios of function, patterning harmonics of the elemental media for \"perceptual\" metabolism etc.). Since each such field is correlated with a psychic or brain-mind center, the relations and delicate chemical adjustments amongst their encoded patterns must undergo an aggravated realign- ment; this accounts for the \"trigger\" effect of the dopamine molecule in cases of schizophrenia etc., an effect otherwise unaccountable in terms of overpopulated receptor sites given the specific if unpredictable \"times\" in the onset of symptoms etc. Part VI The following section gives a guideline Table of Correspondences, linking processes of the Life-current described above with systems and centers belonging to disciplines enjoying cmeacy according to one or more traditions. Now that the relationships have been satisfactorily traced and processes described, relating the ways in which pattems of the physically focused field represent--by reflexive self-symbolization-the telescoped composite of Hypostatic foci integrated through the spiritual breath-current (emanatively expressive of inbuilt ontological factors), the work of the several disciplines may be compassed on the whole-being basis of a scientiific esotericism according to a true hierarchy of cause. Tbe functional correlation between higher-order currents and the lobes, glands, ganglia, senses and organs of the \"physical fonn\", as well as mediating agencies of cfiabas, acupuncture meridians etc. (gaining greater currency in occidental circles as the objections to asiatic wisdom erode) must gradually lead to an integrated spiritual medicine and overall divine science successful in superior measure to the degree it grounds itself in direct orientation, practical alignment and first-person understanding of the regnant requirements of Soul. This millennial Table, seed of a functional universe, is divided into two cross-related columns, or (depending on limits of the publishing foxmat in which the reader presently finds it) two succeeding but cross-referred sections. One section is labelled the column of Fohat, conscious- ness-matter, and represents the function of Light-value fiom the Hypostases as described above acting upon the respective organs, centers and systems through the conscious axis; and one section is labelled the column of Kunddini, nature-current (according to Southern Crown refinement of the basic theosophical descriptions) representing the function of reflective energies correlated with the causal vehicle or breath-soul, and associated with the autonomic systems just as Light of Fohat fiom the Hypostases is associated with the central nervous system. Notably, the list of \"conscious\"/\"subconscious\" centers and psycho-active processes overlaps on certain items (e.g. \"liver\" and \"gall bladder\" appear under both Noetic columnar headings for Fohat and Kundalinq; in all such cases, thefunctions are differentiated whether or not"},{"pageNumber":1013,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the respective sites for the complementary workings within each center or organ are indicated. This reflects the varying degree of differentiation obtaining for forms of the given Agency in any particular case, and is grossly reflective of the specialized \"intensity\" with which such con- scious/subconscious powers focus through and employ the particular site, the quotient of coordina- tive congruence between their respective functions at that site etc* The whole System being variable according to \"spiritual time\" density equivalence (e.g. the correspondences cited here, take their point-ofdeparture in 3rd density styles of rnindhody organization), it must be kept in mind that application toward such a system in light of the superior wisdom taking account of its effective interactions necessarily serves \"in the long run\" to mod@ vehicular relationships as they initially obtain. (This is in theory no different than the kinds of refinements made in the automotive industry where, over a period of time, improvements in the llnkage and closer gear ratios are innovated so as to conserve the system, improve its overall perfonnance and reduce aggregate wear from friction etc.) Suffice here to relate that the ancient yogic science notes a \"division of labor\" in its chakra systems, whether or not the given school reifies the discernible differentiation as a dualistic set of parallel centers: the chakras are described running down the front over the sternum and in general alignment with the vagus nerve (a part of the peripheral and cervical nerve-networks belonging to the autonomic system) and, at the same time, nuzning a twin string of \"subtle lotuses\" up the back in general conjunction with the cerebrospinal or central nervous system. Thus we may find-- our Table of Correspondences--the power belonging to the Hypostatic intelligence as consciousness-matter mediating Noetic Value, operating through the posterior hypothalamus and dorsal pituitary; while the power belonging to the Hypostatic intelligence as nature-matter mediat- ing Noetic value, functions through the anterior hypothalamus and ventral pituitary. In the overlap of operators with respect to \"liver\" and \"kidney\", on the contrary, we find their discrete participa- tions discriminated chiefly by function rather than zone (describing the locus physically identifiable as \"liver\" in terms of the operator Fohat, we find it characterized according to acupuncture study in its relation to nerve-networks governing peripheral motor activity and the neuromdar system; describing it in tern of the operator t 'kundalini\", we find it characterized in correlated acupuncture and biomedical terms as the physiological purifier of the bloodstream etc.). Indeed the millennia1 innovation of our Table of Correspondences takes more than a minor share of its uniqueness fi-om this feature of its classificatory order: discriminating the operative presence, function and participation of conscious/subconscious \"emissaries\" through systems and centers of the mind/body form, can only secure over time an accelerated respect and reverential expertise relative to the real subtlety and sublime comprehensiveness of even the minutest mode materially considered. An entirely revolutionary conception of the character of \"health\" and \"well-being\" is bound to come about, and an altogether-superior wisdom regarding the practical manner of their attainment. Not only the ways in which mind and emotion affect physical function * ~lso, the fact of the physical systems being telescoped or stylistically compressed structures perceived \"horizontally\" by a tacit multidimensionality of summary focus, necessarily produces the effect that an organ or system chiejly ascribed to a particular value-level (e.g. Form, Structure etc.) will nonetheless appear at times to be doing double service under another categorical heading.

Finally, understanding of the interrelationships and hierarchic requirements of such systems will serve to place the very Art and Science of Spiritual Realization upon an unimpeachably sound basis (so to speak), eternal proof against the perennial fauxpas of unripe practices breeding more superstition than substance, yet flaunting an unearned endurance owing to earlier absence of any universal Discipline or truly Divine Science (forestalled in its Birth by the fateful distortion visited on the seed of Bawnian science) that might have interrupted its protracted imposture.

The liver is likewise correlated to regulatory functions of the neuro-muscular system, is involved in peripheral motor activity (through motor centers of the brain, cf. prefiontal cortex) and applies to muscle tone as well as to that of tendons and ligaments.

Yin Water organ-meridian system, called \"Basis of Life\", \"Root of Life\" (cf. Qabalistic Yesod, \"Foundation\"). Kidneylyin water organ-meridian is considered \"immortal\" owing to its involvement in genetic regulation and control (chiefly through the adrenal cortex, see below). Its function focuses overall determination of the vitality-level; thus it's regarded as principal factor regulating longevity, and the general mindhdy life cycle. The renal kidney of Western physiology reflects this hypostatic function in quantified terms through its regulation of acid-base (pH) balance in metabolizing electrolytes (urinary tract excretion or resorption of minerals, unused testosterone and estrogen hormones etc.); homeostatically optimizing blood!tissue fluid compositions through recycling and excretion of waste products, removal of excess water and metabolites from blood Yin Water organ-meridian system includes the adrenal glands, i.e. cortex and medulla regions situated atop the kidneys. The adrenal medulla produces ndtenalineinoradrenaline (cf. development of sympathetic nervous sys- tem on nature-side). The adrenal cortex is an endocrine gland. It produces steroids regulative of metabolic, reproductive, excretory, immundefensive and mineralizing functions. Hormones of the adrenal cortex participate in regulating sugar metabolism through action on-the pancreas; others by direct secretion into the system influence gonadotropic hormonal generation, wherefore the asiatic model ascribes to the adrenal cortex the power of presiding over \"ancestral energy\", i.e. the sperm and ova. The Yin Water organ-meridian system is said to store ching, the vital essence. Ching is a subtle reserve energy and nerve tonic; its accumulation is a type of vital-potential charge, as is paralleled in the yogic system of energy-accumulatiodstorage through the abdominal locus etc. The kidney organ with its parallel plexuses and meridional networks is considered the main reservoir of"},{"pageNumber":1017,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV ching, or subtle vital-energy, for the whole bodily-being. Both the adrenals and reproductive glands are given as part of the \"kidneys\", in the asiatic model; thus ching is the vital essence involved in secretions manufactured or stored by those glands, and presides in general over the reproductive physiology. Through polarized relation of the Psychic Hypostasis (functioning in identified corre- spondence with the breath-soul, projectively displaced from the spinal axis and concentrated into the abdominal locus) the spinal cord is energized, and brain directly vitalized, by kidneylreproduc- tive centers. Thus the locus ofpsychic balance is efficiently determinative of overall available energy of the system according to polarizations of afbitylantipathy (reflected quantitatively in blood lactate, detoxification bottlenecks etc.), the relative integration of charge potentials (quantified in terms of electrolytidion regulation mapping flow-patterns, values of bio-electric and magnetic coherencelalignment) and aggregate circulatory maintenance. Ching of the kidneyNin Water organ-meridian system governs the lumbar region of the back and the skeletal system as a whole inclusive of teeth, marrow and bones, furnishin% the vital-essence or subtle lifeforce sustaining their cycles and activities; its infusion of the bone marrow makes it a key factor in blood production, immunological resistances etc. It imparts vital strength and flexibility to the spine, knees and joints (rheumatological implications should be apparent; the co~ection of viral disease and progressive, elastin decrepitude of the collagen in connective tissues as well as the immunological impairment of kidney function, co-presence of anemias etc. through various rheumatoid abnormalities indicate the appropriate line of holistic inquiry). As a vitaking lifeforce or subtle essence, ching is associated with pubescence and the regulation of hairgrowth. The asiatic model for the kidney-meridian system reveals that it \"opens into the ears\", and is thus responsible for energizing the hearing faculty. In this connection the parotid facial glands, as psycho-emotional centers holonomically involved by resonant correspondence with affective regencies of the abdominal loci, as well as mandibular and maxiliary nerves linking parallel regions with the paired ears and glands, are duly integrated as aspects of the overall complex (see Mental value, Thoracic region above--note lalana chakra, storage of bindu or nectar of the subtle essence). While the kidney-meridian system is characterized as principally YidWater, as all exemplifications of the Wu-Wei it possesses Yin and Yang components both of which in their various harmonies are efficiently responsible for operative energy-magnitudes and vitaldistribution assignments over the whole mind/body complex. Yin- value applies through actual tissues, hormones andfluid of the kidneys, gonads and adrenals etc. Yang-value of the meridional system applies to the quotient of vitality effectively surcharging and generated through those components of the kidneylreproductive complex. The psychic value associated with \"kidney Yin Water organ-meridian system\" is that of will, and the principle of courage.

Small Intestine: Yangjire organ-meridian system. Bacteriological environment whereby nutrients are analyzed of impurities, compounded and processed for absorptive assimilation through the system. Its regulatory function is related to the pituitary gland, the hormones of which conduct metabolic and energy-levels, psycho-emo- tionalladaptive responses and resistances, sexual functions and behaviors; thus the production and absorption of basic nutrients essential to structure, is affected or substantially influenced by hormonal correlations and meridional relationships whereby the small intestine participates as function of, and in monitoring capacity over, the process of vital-emotional balance (thus the emphasis often placed in \"esoteric9~ction regarding vigilance over mood and emotion while eating, digesting and assimilating). Correspondingly the Small Intestine is involved in the assimi- lation of ideas, thoughts and concepts, through those processing/coordinative patterns as which they pass into encoded bio-psychic and physical life-structures.

In that capacity the liver-organ and meridional systems serve the qualitative organization of formative constituents (e-g. amino acids, proteins), building out the specific typologies of sexual and genetic \"profile\" with reflex on the immune function (identifica- tion of \"self '/\"not self' operators etc.). Thus the iiver/meridional system is responsible for production of essential protein factors in the blood plasma: coagulation proteins for blood-clotting"},{"pageNumber":1019,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of damaged vessel-walls; albumin for regulation of water exchange between tissues and blood; immune system complement (eleven sequentially interactive proteins which variously-enhance phagocytic attraction to antigen-antibody complexes, release inflammatory agent and serve to modulate other complement interactions); globin; a component of oxygen-bearing hemoglobin pigment; cholesterol (essential for sexual function) and fat-carrying proteins. Amino aciak are sent to liver from absorption in smd intestine (qv, Value: Structure) where they're recombined into proteins, urea, liver-manufactured \"non-essential\" aminos and glucose. The liver system also serves the catabolism of hormones. Both liver and kidney (qv, Value: Form) mediate detoxification functions for the bloodstream. Liver modifies the chemical structure of various absorbed substances, making them water soluble and prepared for excretion inbile. Bile transports waste from liver, and aids fat catabolism/absorption in the smd intestine. (Oxygenated blood from hepatic artery and nutrient-rich blood from portal vein, is processed through liver into hepatic veins--thence to posterior vena cava circulating deoxygenated blood to right atrium of heart [qv Value: Mental].) Gall bladder: through small tubular cystic duct branching hm bile duct, bile produced in the liver is passed to gall bladder for storage and concentration; when food from stomach moves to duodenum, gall bladder expels bile content into duodenum by contractile influence of gastrointes- tinal hormones secretin and cholecystokinin; bile emulsifies fats and oils from food content in the duodenum. In the asiatic model, gall bladder enhances strength of muscles especially in legs, by relieving muscle fatigue in association with lymphatic detoxification processes.

Life-organ-acupuncture: Lungs-Yin organ-meridian system dominated by Metal energy; governs Ch'i (subtle energy field). Cellular respiration and that of pores, skin etc. is regulated by lung meridian. Heart-Yin Fire organ-meridian system. Heart is regulative locus of rnind/psyche/emotions, in the asiatic system said to be the \"Master Organ\" in which Shin, Spirit, resides. (Note the Hebrew letter Shin signifies Spirit.) Lungs are principal respiratory organ serving C02 elimination, and blood/body oxygenation. Heart is chief organ of circulatory system respon- sible for pumping blood to lungs and throughout body. Greater portion of heart is composed of specialized muscle, the myocardium. A thick muscle wall (septum) divides the four-chambered heart into leftlright cavities, each half having an upper chamber (atrium) and lower (ventricle). Blood is conducted to atria or ejected by ventricles, through large blood vessels emerging from top and sides of heart. Veins (vena cava) conduct body's deoxygenated blood to right side of heart (see liver under Value: Noetic). Blood entering right atrium moves to right ventricle, where it's pumped by pulmonary artery to lungs for oxygenation and C02 elimination. Oxygenated blood from lungs is conducted to the lep atrium through pulmonary veins, drawn to the left ventricle and distributed throughout body. Drumbeat maintenance and modulation of the circulatory pattern is attributable to the heart's \"pacemaker\", located atop the right atrium. Electrical impulses of the sinoatrial node conducted both by heart muscle and specialized nerve fibers, regulate heartbeat sequence in the"},{"pageNumber":1020,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV atridventricular systole (contraction-phase), and diastole (relaxative-phase). The atridventricular systole is induced by electric-sinoatrial impulse, spreading hm atria to atrioventricular node. Complex resonance patterns, of consmctive or destructive interference-modulations variably proportional to biosphericfrmfields, are conducted in the continuous translations of mechanical-to biomagnetic-to-piezoelectric energies for the overall system through oscillatory beat-phase rhythms, organized via hearthing interaction.

Splenetic func- tions include pancreas (insulin etc.)--thus, pancreatic gland. Also, A&enal medulla. Spleen oversees the digestion, absorption and distribution of nutritive substances and fluids; in conjunction with kidney sharing regulatory role for fluid circulation, spleen conducts a coordinative process for overall gastrointestinal function. Its lunar and tidal correspondences are reinforced through a subsidiary aspect of general fluid-reguiation, i.e. its role in regulating quantity and quality of menstrual blood. This is reflex of its participation in lymphatic system; it combats infection on behalf of irnmunofunctions by production of xenophobic antibodies, thephagocyres and lymphocytes that gobble foreign microorganisms; the spleen has lymphatic tissue made of these phagocytes, lympho- cytes and red blood cells. Spleen serves the function of ehinahg worn-out red blood cells. In the fetus itproduces such cells, a job postnatally assumed by the bone marrow (however in the case of bone marrow diseases such as thalassemia, the spleen may resume its--prenatal--task of red blood cell production). In the asiatic model, the spleen participates in extraction of Ch 'i (vital-energy) from digestive processes of stomach, and serves meridionally to conduct ch'i to the lungs. In conjunction with lungs (qv Value: Mentar) which also extract vital-ch 'i through respiration, the spleen is efficiently in charge of overall tonicity and physical vitality; limb-muscle development and maintenance; and those flesh-building processes conducted continuously throughout the body. This overall vital function is augmented by digestive and hormonal processes of the pancreas. The pancreas is a gland, composed of both exocrine and endocrine tissues. It's primarily made up of exocrine tissue, in which are embedded nests of endocrine cells (islets of Langerhans). Digestive enzymes are secreted by exocrine cells into ductile networks converging to form the pancreatic duct; the pancreatic duct merges with common bile duct transporting bile fiom the gall bladder, to form the ampulla of Yarer--a small chamber opening into duodenum. Digestive enzymes (of the pancreatic exocrines) are catalyzed by other duodenal enzymes, and serve the digestive functions of catabolizing carbohydrates, proteins, fats and nucleic acids. Pancreatic exocrine tissues serve to neutralize stomach acids entering the duodenum, through bicarbonate secretion. Endocrine cells in islets of Langerhans secrete hormones insulin and glucagon into surrounding blood vessels, serving"},{"pageNumber":1021,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV to regulate blood glucose levels. Adrenal medulla produces adrenaline/noradrenaline, same sub- stances generated by sympathetic-system nerve endings (development of sympathetic nervous system, nature-side).

Etheric nerve-current: VitaVearth-went (imparts structure). Life-organ (acupuncture): Large Intestine. Stomach. Yang Earth organ-meridian system. Biologically, the systems through which food is catabolized into nutritional constituents, passed to small intestine (qv Value: Vital-physical, Fohat column) for bloodstream absorption. In the asiatic model, the ch 'i (vitalenergy) is extracted fiom food content along with action of pancreas, then passed via meridional network to lungs for blending with respiration ch'i (surcharging air-anions etc.). Combined ch'i is conducted through lung meridian in circulation throughout mindtbody complex. The Yang Earth organ-meridian system is responsible for building and conditioning striate (voluntary) muscle, has a direct influence on fluid metabolism and, through digestive processes, conditions functions of lips. saliva etc. We've come to see that the mincvbody processes through which we practically exist, and by which an intelligible world comes-to-be, are functions of a hierarchic process; that the elements of such hierarchic process, while mutually influential and sensitively responsive on an acute/reciprocal basis, take their point of departure in a very specific Value of the diversified operation--so that, for example, the only ''competition\" or \"contention\" involved in their interac- tions (mental, psychic, physical) stems fiom the interpretive refictions mediated through relative foci of those processes. Whether Reality is ultimately vital-physical, atomic, energetic, spiritual, archetypal, ideal etc. is not a conveniently \"unresolvable\" question suited for categorial embalming in the Syntopicon--at a minimal, initiatory threshold in the integration~alignment or ongoing intensive function of those processes, they themselves achieve a hallmark lucidity cooperatively conductive of a common \"answer\" for the myriad questions such services may have meanwhile engendered; the virtue of such an \"answer\" supplied by the total, cooperative interaction of processes at a threshold level, lies in the inescapable fact that it's qdictic-it is self-evidently true since it's no longer product of a specialized emphasis in function (i.e. left-brain styles of cognition) but whole-being harmony of function, integrated through and as expression of a common-unitive Ground. All modes interpretable as energetic, biological or subtle-atomic constitute compositor functions of apsychic integrity, excited on behalf of a perceptual-cognitive hmework; perceptions and cognitions are models of the informing ideowe; and the ideotype is engaged as a principal function of Identity, representing the value of whole-being consciousness addressing the delimiting venue of its creative prerogative through \"transtransfinite\" mediator or \"universal ordinal\" of the Point-locus. Therefore the question of \"reality\" altogether doesn't depend nor has it ever depended upon secondary processes of reflexive creativity or interpretive expression enabled throughed symbolically mirroring--the ontological constants. Those secondary processes are not rightly understood through any comparative evaluation of their contents, the \"considered\" products of their"},{"pageNumber":1022,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV activities in themselves etc. but only insofar as they uniformly characterize and functionally enable immediate apprehension of the whole-being ground they celebrate (e.g. either in puzzling panto- mime as in 3rd density, stentorian operatic allusion as in 4th density, self-closed pictorial or \"mandalic\" parable as in 5th or immediate Self-exclamatory fashion as in 6th). Thus all such creative, cognitive and perceptual processes along with their bewildering amazonian networks of supportive energy-grids must be known in term of the Ontology they express, not in deflective and distractive terms of conditional ontoIogicaI interpretation (the latter clearly distinguished and distinguishablefi.om the Former as reflective content, rather than as essential Form-essential Form permits the free-flow of all interpretive contents without falling to the reflection, in consistent maintenance of its integral being as Void-value bending all contents back in genuflective acknow- ledgment of that Mothering Source). Thus we can never resolve the conundrum-of-Being or recline like Vishnu on the Lotus-bed of our Origmal Nature, by any mode of \"reality creating\", by manipulative modifications of powers and potentialities-powers and potentialities \"built into\" the aggregate Pattern in any case on the basis of ontological Propositions, or primordial principles, that never yield nor mold into conformance with such secondary functional potentials since they preside Immaculate in Eternal Conceptual Support of them (if, in this peroration, you hear faint echo of the Enunciation of the Virgin to Bernadette at Lourdes, i.e. \"I am the Immaculate Conception\", the allusion is no accident This statement, so \"heretical\" to the Church Fathers protecting their velour flanks at the time, was perfectly sublime Expression of the Spiritual Truth-of-Being outclassing by a billion- light-years the dire negative-cast predictions Intoned by Orion-wunterfeit at Fatima). Locating the Source of our condition, then, obviously can't be done by painting alternate versions of its unsolved symbols! (So goodbye, ye host of misbegotten busybodies hm Elsewhere.) We must favor the earlier discussion given here of Ontological principles, settling first of all around the spiritual Point-proposition of being. This Coordinate Point (Castaneda's assemblage point, remember, is not essentially different from SC's coordinate point except according to contingencies of respective practice) is the root and foundation of our whole spiritual geometry, and is therefore the Reality behind all architectural geometries in general whether ofAssiah or Briah etc. The fixity of this point is noetic, or ideal. It is the still Point-of-being by definition, not by infinitesimal corrections of the measuring rods. (Similarly, all geometry arising hm the \"point\" is first of all noetic; the straightness of Line in spiritual terms is given ideally, a function of the ontological proposition: \"infinite continuity and homogeneity in finite terms\". Its ideal character doesn 't mean it doesn 't exist; rather, its existence is first of all ideal-again, it's given definitionally rather than asymptotically by the standard of \"rigid rods\" etc.) Such fixed, centralizing point isfirnctionally a locus, as we've seen (the collector or state-assemblage of all possible coordinates, vectors etc. for a given field). Its existence is precisely analogous to, and underlies in fact, the celebrated Self-re+rence paradox-and here's where we may locate the Place at which we must mount our concerted assault on the Citadel of Being, so as to resolve its mystery permanently and not provisionally. We've seen already that this fixed poidcenter, as the coordinative locus of being enrooting the whole self-reference paradox (embodying the proposition \"infinite continuity\" etc. \"in finite terms\", on behalfof the Absolute proclamation \"infinite continuity\" etc. \"under all conditions\") occasions the Creative overspill of Chaos. It presides at the cosmic percolation of Tohu 'v 'bohu. Examining these spiritual fhcts more closely, we may now close in on the great Metaphysical Calculus whereby the"},{"pageNumber":1023,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV basic Questions-of-Being may be addressed at last on their own terms, so as to find surcease in the Arms of their Real Mother (relieving them with the Lullaby of their inbuilt harmony). The Point-locus is not an objective coordinate in itself but a persistent reference; such point-presence is not only indefinitely displaced thrbugh the whole of being: it's referenced by such coordinate displacements, coming to expression as variable ratios and proportions of self-consis- tencylself-displacement. It therefore hctions (in evocative and not-unsuitable modem tenns) as a Strange Attractor. The strictly geometric point (i-e. the nondimensional origin of \"geoW-earth, \"metry\"- measurement) is a function of the median focal resolution which always displaces in two directions, the infi@tely Great and the infinitely Srnall-between those variables of mutual displacement an apparently \"fixed\" objective reference may be established; this is simply due to varying rates-of- change in the compositor elements of that focal field (i.e. stream and stone, the flights of birds, the background glide of starfield and the erosion of ridges--simply put, we don't stake our architectural foundation on a quagmire ... unless of course we're selling Florida real estate by mail). The \"fixed point\" produces a finite emulation of the self-referred locus-of-being, which isn 't contingently predicated through its own displacement-field but is coordinatively referenced through that field; the self-referring character of such a prototype locus generates varying ratios and proportions of prevalence between the two conditions (self-referred locus and \"fixed point\" representative) depending on \"qualifiers\". This is the condition that makes its variability chaotic, not-linear. In terms of Dynamic Logic, the truth-value of the self-reference is expressed as some replacement-value for itself; it substitutes for itself or represents itsevthrough the coordinates of its own locus. Its qualifiers are its symbolic self-representsrtives. Insofar as it negates itselfthrough its qualifiers, it establishes an oscillation between proportional values malung itself a Strange Attractor. And it continuously negates itself since the coordinates through which it's referenced are replacement or representative (self-symbolizing) values. Onlyp as 0.5 doesn't oscillate. (!4 spin is fermion value--stable matter particle.) The fluctuations and interchanges described by this process give the psychic factor informing, and accounting for, all the states of perception and cognition, the hide-and-seek . . displacements of relieflrecess c- the variable modes of sense; the mental modelings and moody rotations of the thinking process; the incessant masques-of-identity swapping conscious for subconscious partners across the theatrical threshold of dream.

The coexistence of such changeless serenity, as ifthe hub of the Wheel had been found, in continuity with the incessantly-rotating spokes of self-modifving activity as is modeled through coordinative equations of the Point-locus, has indeed been represented across the spiritual traditions in various forms as the Holy Grael, the Summum Bonum, the coveted identity of samsara/nirvana- and, so problematically self-contradictory has the doubledemand of the ideal proven both in theory and practice, that historical solutions from whatever source seem always inferentially to sacr@ce one side, no matter how subtly, in favor of the side left standing.

At this point we'll review what those key issues actually are, stripped of sectarian accretions and iconographic accumulations so that it becomes progressively apparent how \"changing the reality configuration\" in terms of preferred features and idealized qualities is ever only a distraction from the central challenge of aligning and amplz@ng the integral Fom (out of agencies of those projective features) in orientation mud the Ontological constants- thereby recovering Identity with and through the perdurable Term of all changing venues, in essential rapport with the apodictically-consistent Common Denominator of all seeming diversity."},{"pageNumber":1025,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV If the-shifting-compensatory balances between consciousness and subcon- sciousness furnish us the image of mirroring bars divided into mutually offsetting ratios between sewnot-self, why may we not recognize the image of equilibrium in a single bar simply divided in half: 50150 gives us a neutrmliring bake in which the squaring-dance of sewnot- self settles into suave self-cancellation, and the drive of \"dilemma\" slows to a halt. This is, after all, what the yogic traditions recognize as the indispensablesoric quality. What matters, then, that this bar be \"mirrored\" in the dream-domain? They (the bars) remain simple equivalents. Inferentially, what becomes of the distinction between o conscious^' and Lbsubcon- scious\"? .,the polarized currents through which the ideotypes of the identity-processes are patterned (thoughts, perceptions, feelings, cognitions) may achieve the likeness of such a balance only in a special way; this is due to the hct that the respective currents do not have equivalent charges in their functions through the mind-body system. This implies the require- ment of a specific ratio between the currents in order to achieve the model Balance of our ideally-divided bar. Therefore the real point to the relationship between consciousness and experience rotates inevitably back around again to the central question of the Self-reference paradox. It oscillates unerringly toward its own \"state attractor\" comprising theprimary term of reality, rather than to the secondary and symptomatic products of that basic Enigma. ...prop ortional assessment must confer a superior relationship of correspondence between the \"greater\" value and unity, since the ascription of objectively equal weight to the terms inferentially seals the triumph of the \"lesser\" (or negative) principle so that it succeeds in having \"its way\": an equrrlizing apportionment (direct 50150 assay) cancels the terms to zero while implicitly endorsing the value of Negation against the proiific creativity (and innate valid&) of manifestation since the directly-equivalent termsstalemzte one another: their direct equivalency produces astofic zeroing or inert equilibrium definitively silencing the mechanism of ratio, which alone secures the contrasts indicative of creative appearance. But this cancels the term of fin& as well; the \"triumph\" of Ahriman would thus implicitly be guaranteed, for a 50150 apportionment banishes the projected fmite ground of resolution in an annihilative exxing of oppositional values at Infm&. Thus the negative proposition of Ahriman would succeed in coexisting at infinity with that of Ormudz, the creation would be stilled in accordance with the antipathetic value expressed through Ahriman so that, by inference, Ahriman wins wherever He can be placed upon equal footing. AU Ahriman needs is equal footing, not superior status, to triumph over Ormudz the Good principle; for such \"equal footing\" is indeed dualism, as the conventional accusation against Mdism has it. \"Equal footing\" succeeds in canceUing the creation upon an Infinite (and therefore unresolvable) ground, where positive and negative indeed float in Eternal indistingukhable equivlrlency. Yet the express stipulation of Zoroastrianism is that the battle of the principles be given afinite limit in which to resolve itself. Its venue of resolution is therefore the field of time; this ensures that the creative Term of Limit, and therefore the innate \"validity\" of finitude, will not be violated in the process; if the term of creative limit is conserved, Ahriman's bLsolution~' (annihilative cancelling and lapse to indistinguishable infinity) can't be honored"},{"pageNumber":1026,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV and has no ultimate justification. At the same time, conservation of finitude requires expression of the Resolution of \"contending\" principles as some rrrfio in the balance of charges, as we've seen. This means however that the Zoroastrian stipulation re a fhife time for the accomplishment of Resolution infers and requires the apotheosis of a proportion, some ideal geometric harmony for the optimizing of a Mean. Such bbMean\" is of course given in the Golden Proportion. Thus we're perfectly justified in our insistence that the Mazdaian stipulation of ''time\" or finite limit as the venue of Resolution declares Onnudz's author& andpmprietorsh@ of the controlling tenn from the beginning. The insistence upon the finite term in Zoroastrianism not only demonstrates safficient honoring of the innate validity belonging to the principle of limit (so as to secure the relationship of Love between consciousness-absolute and the creative field, conserving the sacred legitimacy of the latter); such honoring of the '%nite9' autont(LtiCah'y ensures against the ultimate anti-creative or negative victory of Ahriman, which is the postulate of \"infinite equal footing\" or \"eternal dualism\" mistakenly attributed to Zoroastrianism as a whole, since anyfinite resolution of the contending terms requires a ratio in the distribution of weight to their respective values both in order to conserve the term of \"limit\" and to resolve the elements to unity (rather than to the eternally-irresolute stalemate of an annihilative--or merely dispersive-exxing of principles without hope of coherent integration). Our key postulate here of course, is that a solution mq be modeled. Given the existence of a viable model, keys to the functional correspondences of the model, a suitable initiatory practice incorporating those functional features and the essential starterdough of a resonantly-inductive entrainment (by spirituaVpsych0-somatic superposition hm the Living Whole-being Exemplifi- cation of such valued Pattern, understood in the traditions as Saktipat or Gum-Kn'pa, Hierophantic Transmission etc.) there is no further reason humanity should remain in the dark, no reason it should seek its solutions as if they existed \"outside itseIfY, hm Elsewhere-no reason the implicit universal Conundm of the traditions should seem to remain unsolved. What the mystagogue and professional seeker alike love most to conserve as sacrosanct \"eternal verity\", is the \"mystery of it all\", the convenient b~owableness\" of everything--which of course if they were really to honor same would stop them dead in their tracks, and shortcircuit the very thing for which they invoke that Grand Impenetrability in the first place, i.e. their safe vocational fixation in those saleable trade items and inexhaustible features of the Search itself. Our model is given below. The reader need only know its functional correspo dences. Thus, when we speak of the basic \"Model of 10 total units\", we are referring to the Co d ousness Axis, the multidimensional Pleroma or Common Denominator of Spirit-Identity Itself (known variously as suswnna, or citrini withinSusmna, thepoteau mitan in voudoun, the Maypole in Celtic rites and, secretly, the Bole of the Christmas Tree with its electrically lit chakra-ornaments, in the modem commercial ritual of capitalized potlatch). The value denominated Hot with strength-value 3 per unit, corresponds to the portion of autonomic or sub-conscious nervous systems known as the sympathetic; in Hindu terms this would be the fiery or rajasic gunam related to pingala, and the agni tattva (fight-flight etc.), thus we call it \"hot\". The value denominated Cold with strength value 2 per unit, corresponds to theparagmpathetic or sedative system of the overall autonomic complex. In Sanslcrit parlance this would be the tamasic or waterylearthy quality related to the subtle-lunar nerve current i& and the varuna tattva; thus we call it \"cold\". From the respective unit-ascriptions"},{"pageNumber":1027,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV we may note the uneven distribution of proportional strength or emphasis between \"hot\" and \"cool\" systems, just as a flame is more compelling than pond-water. At the same time we note the central nervous system or consciousness-axis necessarily receives the equilibrative Gunam or quality of sattva, related to susumna and the element (or tattva) of Akash. As a start, the only other thing the reader need know is that the ratios in respective strengths of function between hot and cold (sympatheticlparasympathetic systems) with respect to the Whole-being Model of the Conscious Axis, may be modified with the modification of breath-- in the breathing practices given at the beginning of this Organum for immediate benefit of all. (A) Model has 10 units total Hot: Strength value 3 per unit Cold Strength value 2 per unit Hot value: 3011 0 Cold value: 2011 0 In order for hot and cold values to break symmetrically (50150) over 10 unit model, one can't just divide each by half--that would give a 1511 0 ratio hot to cold. How many units of cold value to hot value would be required to break symmetrically? You'd need 6 units of Cold, giving total strength value 12, to 4 units of hot giving total strength value of 12.50/50. Let's see what we obtain, against the ideal case, by calculating \"real\"-4.e. operative- proportions, giving ratios realistically representative of the current operative condition or level of integration/'balance indicative of the general mind-body \"formula\" in 3rd density: \"right now\", one functions on: 4 units of cold (4 x 2) = 8 strength value, to 6 units of hot (6 x 3) = 18 strength value Mirror Reversal-complementary (Non-Abelian) symmetry: 8ux2s.v. = 16+8=24 2u x 3s.v. = 6 + 18 = 24 (Note doubling of the ideal strength value 12) Suppose we attempt the simple-symmetry formula by splitting the number of Model- units evenly: 5u x 2s.v. = 10; 5u x 3s.v. = 15. An equilibration to that proportion can be given in two ways, both of which reflect a compensatory ratio set over against the existing proportion in anti-commutative fashion, which does not however establish the appropriate ratio of balance strictly within the proportions of the existing system. Example I: 5 x 2 = 10; 5 x 3 = 15 (see above); what's required in compensation is: 7u. x 2s.v. = 14: 3u. x 3s.v. (hot) = 9. 14 + 10 = 24; 9 + 15 = 24. Note that this doubles the ideal s.v. product of 12. We've \"canied over\" into the subconscious domain for technicallycompensatory values. Example 11: (+) 1 1 iu x 2i (cold) s-v. = -22/(&)9iu. x 3i (hot) s.v. = -27. -22 -(+I 0) = 1U-27 -(+15) = 12. Note in this case, the value of the Model as a whole had to be doubled in total units, rather than the product of strength values. Such compensatory equations don't constitute a true resolution within the system, but mirror counter-adjustive properties of a compensatory stress-disequilibration in complementary terms. The values of such terms would have to be integrated to the prevailing proportions of the real systems so as actually to modify those proportions. The non-commutative reflection-equations give dream-values, show the forces, pres- sures, tones, qualities and psychic properties displaced into desire-forms and fears, phantasmagoric illustration and symbol-condensation by the continuous off-set \"slide\" of operative ratios in waking-consciousness codes around the stable, proportional harmony (6 of cold, 4 of hot). This is the actual sense of Jung's Shadow, Anima.Animus, the Freudian \"wish-fulfillment\" fmtasies of the dream mind etc. It accounts for the often disturbing contents of the offsetting or symbolically"},{"pageNumber":1028,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV compensating foxms. They give the haunting condition for the complex network of countervalues produced by continual displacement of the consciousness-system as a whole around the optimum ratio of resolution (i.e. between \"hot\" and \"cold\", sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems with respect to the whole-being value of thi: conscious axis). They don't depict terms to be incorporated as they are in order to complement and offset or \"cancel\" the prevailing disproportions of the consciousness-systems, though this has been thefiepent historical interpretation, as when spiritual practitioners assume a rigid counter-pleasure in the form of severe austerity, penance, withstanding of pain and discomforts artificially prolonged etc. This interpretation of \"complemen- tary\" values as are to found for example in dream-content, gives us the \"good medicine must taste bad\" philosophy--but it's based on a misunderstanding. Those displaced compensato?y ratios and proportions that pop up in symbolic-configuration through dream content mirroring real experience etc. do not recommend a straight regimen of repair, and shouldn't be taken as such. They portray distortion values reflecting& stress-compellsatory fashion--the prevailing ratios and operative harmonies-of-proportion characteristic of the consciousness-system (central/autonomic) as a whole. They indicate psychic qualities and ratios-of-harmony that must be redressed, assimilatedproperly to a satisfactory summmy proportion strictly in tenns of the real system, a ratio-of-balance in itself optimum to the system (rather than requiring, or generating, shadow-form compensations fiom stressdisplacement values carrying over terms that won't go evenly into the conscious equations). Such dream equations are: Example I, Example 11. Now let's consider the implications of our preliminary modeling in terms of Dynamic Logic. (For those unfamiliar with dynamic logic, it's advisable bt to consult our inset across-the-way wherein we find the MT-adaptation of a good summary description given in the February, 1993 issue of Scienm American.) (B) Total Truth value possible is 1. This is represented for the consciousness system as a whole in the constant @, which gives the only 3-proportion that reduces to One: a.b:c. Therefore value (1) isgiven hereas 1:1.618. cf, Let's now make a statement S which will function as typical of the identity-equations - formulated at the 3rd-stagddensity level, presuming the Whole-of-being as active correspondent of the identification. S: \"This form of Identity embodies cf,, 1-61 80.\" It declares its truth value is complete, whole, equal to 1. Assessed in relation to the impartial Truth of the actual constant, we fmd such declaration of S to hold on 0.4 truth value (it's only 40% me). How true is S? Its truth value s is given as 0.4; thus it's 40% true, which is 0.4:0.6472. Since S posits its value at 1-61 8, we can only take it at the dzflerence between the two values. Since their difference is 0.6 (60%), S is untrue by -06% or .9708 in relation to <P (.9708 + 6472 = 1.618, @). If we model this in two cross-referred statements, S and T, we may calculate successive pairs of values from an initial pair (s, t): S: S is astrue asT is true; T:Tisastrueas S is false (sc14s-t); tcl4t-E 1 *I)) Plotting them as plane coordinates, geometric figures known as dynamic system amac- tors tend to emerge. \"Escape-time\" diagrams on the same order as the suggestive images of the Mandelbrot set may be obtained hm initial representations by calculating the steps required for given value-pair decimal expressions (s, t) to exceed a threshold value e.g. just greater than one, then plotting the coordinate point (dt) in a color coded to the required number."},{"pageNumber":1029,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Dynamic Logic TNth Values in classic logic: I and 0. Statement P with truth value p, which is I or 0. P and not-P, the statement's negation. If P is we, then not-P is false with a truth value of 0--and conversely. This statement is falsen: P says the truth value (p) of this sentence is I -p. If the truth value of P is p, then the truth value of not-P is I -p (i.e., I4 = I; or I -I = 0). This is fine, if P and not-P have separate references. But if P and not-P participate in a sey-reference, P and not-P are inextricable. They're identities. P is then stacing the truth value of P is I -p (i.e. the same as not-P). Then if the truth value p is 0, p equals 1-0, which equals I. It's self negating. If the truth value p is I, then p = I -I which equals 0. Again, it is self negating. It constitutes a perpetuallunresolved oscillation between Zero and One. (Only a truth value p z.05 is stable, as we'll see below.) This is the result of the expression of a unity in finite terms. The infnity implied in the expression as a self-reference, or self-closed illimitable unity, polarizes a contrastive subdivision as vehicle in the extension of that unity to the infinidindeterminate degree. All values fluctuate between Zero and Unity (as we've seen, Zero and Unityare the same); all numbers (differentials) are fluctuating ratios of unity, and are therefore fractional decimals of 1 : .05, .25 etc Truth value p in the self-referring mode needn't equal I -p. This only prevails in classical logic P may have a truth value p of 25% true (i.e. p = 25). Now, if p4-p rather than = I -p an immediate revision of p's truth value requires an assessment of p at .75 (I -25). However, if p is now -75, the formula p-l-p requires an immediate reassessment to -25 ad infiniwm. In the process of funher assessing the truth value of statements about statements, (two statements P and Q with truth values p and q) nonrepeating or aperiodic fluctuations may be produced cascading into chaos. Also, cycles of specific recursions or numerical periodicmes may be generated. \"I, sentence P, say sentence Q is me.\" \"I, sentence Q, say sentence P is false.\" P is p = q. Q is q = I-p. If truth value q is I, then truth value p is I. But Q says truth value q = I+, i.e. 1-1, which is 0. If truth value q is 0 then aYth value p is 0 etc (I 4 = I). If however p- q and q-I+, then we may give fractional values to truth values p and q. If p = -06 and q = -07, then spontaneously p = .07 and q = .04; spontaneously again, p = .04 and q = -03. Again p = -03 and q = .06 then back to the starting point p = .06, q = -07. In dynamic logic theory, one may take two self-referred statements which are at the same time mutually referring (the coinherent polarization factor in the self-referring proposition-of- being actually implies that all resultant dualisms are just differentiated self-references, mutually referred as countercharged complementaries to the nth degree a la the Tai Chi symbol ). As we learn in LogoslAnti-logos Part 11, all cognition is primarily self-referential; every object of percep- tionlcognition is an immediate ideoform unity borrowing against the selfhood of Identity as an immediate self-representation and reference."},{"pageNumber":1030,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV What's the truth value of S? s = 40% Suppose S were of the form of the Self-negation (self-referring statement fkmed in the categorical negative, as in classical logic: \"This statement is false\".) Owing to its self-repre- sentational character, the form of identity which posits totality does so, in golden braid fashion, as an immediate reductive removalfiom the totality; the phenomenon of infinite regress belongs to this order of self-modifying and auto-adjusting reflex (\"I'll remember this moment--and I'll remember that I'd remember this moment, and I'll remember that I remembered that I'd remember this moment\"...). That which is constituted as a positive identity borrows against the whole being value of absolute (permitted owing to its unique character as void) and invests the quality of holism in conditionally modeled terms. Refer to our previous analysis regarding the ideoform quality of perceptiodcognition, through which the abstract unity of self-identity organizes identities consis- tently conformant and intedy homogenous through all contributory terms. From those discus- sions, you'll recall the important point that the tendency-to-Enbfy isn't a falsification of pure \"process\"; patterning processes are organized thn>ugh unifj.ing loci imparting intelligibility, cohesiveness, consistency of identification through compound modes and over variable behavior- factors. The subjective identfication of \"entity\", of coordinate and localized wholes within the field of perception corresponds to real functional wholes as a sympathetic recognition. \"Cat\" takes its point-ofdeparture as an organkdonal unit of coherent./selfcongruent identity, constituting an oblique displacement-locus borrowing against the total consciousness axis of which the self-reflective percipient is efficient \"triangulator\". The organizational field of pattenzing processes configuring the consistent, centralizing self-identity of cat represents a func- tional angle of intersection with reference to the total vertical axis of the (multi-dimensional) consciousness pattern; the ordering system of correspondences through which it arises is modeled as some distortion angle of the total mind/body Standard. The consciousness unit superintending the organization \"cat\" as inquisitive expression of sentient identity-patterns (for purposes of memory cross-reference), assumes the field through which its perceptual characteristics are ordered, as an intersectant and subordinative correspondent of the Whole-being model (the cerebrospinal or--multidirnensional--conscious axis) through the constant reference-fkmework of which it is attracted, compared, associated, rotated ... and throughthe pleromatic axis of which it is \"transferred\" to another orgmhtional complex in the elemental kingdoms representing some greater degree of intensification, coordinative alignment and angular correspondence to the vertical Model of the Whole. Thus the identification of organizational wholes in the perceptual field isn't just an \"entifying\" overlay basically fals'iing a borderless pattern of pure process, but correlates by \"empathetic correspondence\" and likeness-of-unitive being to viable organizational wholes, dis- crete identity-complexes establishing provisional (unitive) continuity and coherent \"entity\" through a defining context. What the \"process\" extollers are trying to identify (so as to avoid its internally- contradictory pitfalls) is the conditional limit which \"entification\"--the Being of Noum-seems to impose upon an overflowing reality provoking control-crisis, anxiety and the intolerably fluxing ambiguities in the profiles-of-identification made through imitative ego-rapport with such mislead- ing \"entities\". However, it isn't the \"entification\", or recognition of (provisionally) discrete and functionally unitive identities in the cognitive field which underwrites the celebrated and problem- atic crisis of ego-identity; it is the degree of commitment and intensity-of-belief with which the whole-being value of Identity authorizes its correspondence or one-to-one identity-equation as a"},{"pageNumber":1031,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1V representative profile (the \"ego-inventory\" etc.). This is the point at which statement S, fully qualifying itself as equivalent to Whole-being value (1, or a), nonetheless extends itself as available candidate for the internal-negation paradox of the self-referring statement Indeed the more completely and one-sidedly the value of Whole-be- ing identity is invested in a representative pattern or surrogate form, the more completely does it become the \"self-referring statement\" flatly declaring the whole of itself false in a complete reversal. However, as we've seen, everything derives from the investment of whole-being Identity imparting an identifying/unitive selfhood to objects and patterns in the perceptual field. Therefore as we find in the system of \"fuzzy logic\", no such statement of identity can be wholly falsified or falsifying (in classic logic remember, if it's true it's automatically f&; but if it's false it's true). It is more consistent with the reality of the case to insist along with \"fuzzy logic\" that some percentage of the self-negating statement must be true (and thus, some percentage false). The understanding established here regarding primary participation of the whole-being value of identity in provisionally defining the selfhood-values of forms (secondarily segregated--by negation-* not-self, which nonetheless in non-Aristotelian fashion can never realize A # non-A), gives us the philosophical justz$cation underlying the otherwise seemingly \"fanciful\" proposition of fuzzy logic that the truth value of statements can befiactional rather than all-or-nothing. Therefore, what if S (\"this form of Identity embodies a, 1 :1.618\") were of the self-reference type of statement? This statement, incidentally, goes for any thought, feeling, perception, emotion, behavior or cognition a person generates. Therefore it's aprototjpal statement, and one should recognize it as being the actual if implicit statement behind all that one says, is and does; for everything is a form of identity, embodying some ratio in the characteristic interaction of mind-body variables--nervous systems, brain-hemispheres etc.--and thus some specific degree or intensity-domain of commitment to whole-being identification through the given, representative form. As we learned in \"Why You Don't Create Your Own Reality\", it is the totality of multidimensional mind-body processes through which the characteristic typologies of thought, desire, behavior etc. are patterned, not just specialized lobes of the brain. Thus every such thought, behavior etc. is a type of identity-equation generated through comesponding ratios in the interactions of \"hot\" and \"cool\" systems with reference t-d borrowing against4e whole being Standard of the constant (conscious) axis. Just as the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous systems aren't really separate fiom the consciousness system but are specialized subdivisions of it, the ideal proportions in the Constant 0 demonstrate the harmonic identity and ultimate unity of the segments with the whole. Given that the characteristic \"cut\" of the governing typologies divides the nervous-systems in variable ratios that oscillate around the resolving 0 standard interaction (most perfectly aligned in congruence of identity with the conscious axis), we may recognize the kinds of thoughts, behaviors and feelings typifying a humanity unresolved by the -5 (50150) net in the ratio of balance between \"greater\" and \"lesser\" systems as reflective of \"malaligned\" properties, to one degree or another, exhibiting representation-identities the contributory patterning ratios of which don 't go evenly into One (the Whole-being value of the Conscious Axis), but fluctuate across the psychic \"special limit set\" or \"equilibrium trajectory\" separating wakefulness fiom the compen- satory counter-ratios of elemental dream composition. Thus if S as a self-referring statement embodies an implicit negation, we may \"weigh\" its relative truth value on these fuzzy-logic scales: Statement S, has a truth value s; not-s has truth"},{"pageNumber":1032,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV value 14. If, as we've suggested, by weighing the contributory stress-ratios comprising the thought-statement-identity equation-against the Total TNth value 1 (expressed by proportion 1 : 1.6 18) we find the statement to hold at -4 truth value, then truth value s of S is 40%. Yet, as the auto-negating function of the sew-referential dent, S tells us to substitute the truth value of not-S, i.e. 14. Thus we find that, rather than its truth value being 0.4:0.6472 (@ x 40%), it is immediately dislocated to 0.6:0.9708 (@ x 60%, 0.6 being its \"untrue\" value; or 1-61 84.647 = 0.971). Yet again, if 0.6:0.9708 is its truth value, we must reflexively substitute -6472 and back again ad idbiturn, in the same way that classical logic forces a perpetual oscillation between 0 and 1. (Dream-cornpensation and back again etc.) When, however, we attempt to apply the 0.5 (50150) equilibrium value in the standard manner, we obtain only a stagnant product--no more equivalent to as a whole-being proportion than any of the previous values (@ x 50% = 0.8090; 0.8090 + 0.8090 = 1-61 8, a). Indeed this is the \"spacedork\" solution, accounting for the peculiarly infantile proportions described by \"abductees\" etc. with regard to their diminutive hosts: The spacedork-body has the propor- tions of the human infant, because there is a secret spiritual statement encoded in those pro- portions. The ratio between body divisions above and below the navel renders an overall symmetry to the proportional harmonics of this fetal type. And the geometric value carried by Symmetry corresponds to just that general, global equilibration and harmonic canceifation of all polar identity-mode potentials through restorative alignment-or turnabout repolari- zation--in positive congruence with the Con- scious Axis. Indeed this represerzZs the very, %I- perior\" power of balanced abstraction said to recommend the given cerebral emphasis of the spacedork type, in confrontation with the mil- lennial requirement of detaching from committed firation to asymmetric, cognitively bblop sided\" perceptual purviews. Why then do we find the higher-density Source-selves of those 4th density dorkotypes, apparentiy reverted to the anisometric or proportional harmonics of the human form? For, just as the fetal-dorkotype suggested in its proportions the nonmanifest value of abstract-symmetrical cancelntion, so the human form equally suggests the priuciple of manifestation owing to the ratio between body divisions above and below the navel (in the adult) that specifically defines a Golden Proportion, or unconstructible equation of angularly contrastive values--the very requirement of manifestable perceptions. At the developmental juncture where we're faced with the b'tumingwall\" of consciousness (i.e. as previously explained, when encountering the inherent bankruptcy of desire-objects in manifest form) would it not seem more correct to opt for the highly Symmetric pattern of the fetal-style proportions--indeed, just as the spacedorks initially did? The answer"},{"pageNumber":1033,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV to this, is telling. The prototype form of the dorks' own Source-selves, gives the message: though it may initirrUy seem so, the object in the recovery of Consciousness is not the unqualified withdrawal from patterns of the creative field. ~h&e are \"coeternal\" with Conscious- ness and indeed themselves encode, in the form of the Logoic Ideotype, the means of correct application to the coinvolved creations so as to align them--ultimately-& helpful congruence with the informing, Conscious value from which their manifestations emerge.

We must ask, then, how the organic ratio essential to pa#erning contrasts (exemplified in @) may be reconciled with such symmeby-equilibrium as is needed for homogenous self-con- gruence in neutral void-value, equivalent to the required standard of consciousness? How may the terms be resolved, when the self-referring character of any substitute value or representative equation participates in the dynamism of perpetuaVunstable oscillation, or settles into the unsatis- factory stasis obtained in the inert equilibrium of -5 value applied by convention for s? We seem to be back at the spiritual doorstep of the traditional dilemma, where the only \"solutions\" flux between a ceaseless \"going\" (in inexhaustible exploitation of the manifest pattem---subtle or gross--by synthesis, syncretism or asymptote) and an inertial \"withdrawal\" or static balance as with inte- riorization and mutual cancelling of polarized sensory-currents to the quiescence of a ''yogic\" tetany . The core of the problem may now be located in its conventionally flat treatment; despite the \"multidimensional\" properties occultly assigned the nervous systems, their subtle centers and currents, there seem to have been no serious consideration paid the sigzllficance of their respective intensity values aside fiom a tabulation of descriptive qualities. The polarities seem consistently treated as equal-and-opposite, regardless the tradition and its characteristic ccsolution\" with respect to that standardized treament No real homage seems to have been paid their hction as ontological representation, a factor which immediately assigns proportional charge to the polarized comple- mentaries so that certain qualities or ratios-of-value segue more smoothly and by consonant correspondence (or homologous continuity) with the whole-being axis owing to their positive correlation, some less so owing to their contrastively negative correlation. For example, \"love\" and \"fear\": in the manifest field each tends to arise as a relative"},{"pageNumber":1034,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV expression of identity investment, thus each tends to be correspondingly compromised with reference to its potential whole-being equivalency as a representative value. Yet this doesn't place them on equal-ifspposite footing. The former bears a relation of correspondence to whole-being by similitude, therefore permitting segue through bference (fiom the familiar, to the self-con- pent and ultimately intimate); the latter bears a relation of correspondence by proportional Negation (in which case either duplicitous substitute correspondences are enacted so as to ape whole-being value through self-insular, distancing \"neutrality\"; or permissive proportions are established by reactive learning-adaptation, through ongoing identity investments). Therefore the equilibrium value -5 must be viewed in another way. Expressive equations of consciousness (\"substitute\" identity-equations) must function as symbols incorporazing the .5 value us elemental operator, working through appropriately scaled intensity-assignments--rather than as operators symbolizing the .5 value according to hidden intensity-assignments firnctioning distortively with respect to whole-being vdue.

Proportionate redistribution of intensity-value to the side of parasympathetidacetylcholine balance and negative-ionizationlalkahity stress emphasis may be established through a discipline of true spiritual Intent involving mechanical exercise on the order of Charger Breathing (changing overall ratio of CO, to 0, in the bloodstream), and a regimen of insight meditation/ontological inquiry on the lines of Magnum Organum using SC study-materials of the Wce and Ray of Intelligent Activity (Mother/Mahachohan) as quickening source texts and long term metaphysical companion-guides. Though the unitlstrength values chosen for our demonstration may seem arbitrary, they possess interesting characteristics of their own serving to invest their minimdinteger status with more than casual property. In the employment of their specific values, we may discern certain solutions serving to relate and reconcile classic pairs and seemingly irreconcilable systems hm antiquity, i.e. the decimal and duodecimal system, @ and II as in the decagon etc. The regular decagon or ten-sided polygon reconciles II with @ geometrically, since it may be inscribed within a circle having a radius 1.61 8 x the decagon edge-length. Subdividing the decagon with radii into ten equal 36\", 72\" and 72\" triangles, the longer edges of each triangle are 1.618 x the length of the shorter edges. It gives the Symmetric void-resolution of polarized identity factors--an equivalency with the \"equilibrium trajectory\" of the Conscious Axis.

Looks like the Marshall is back in town ... Our feature article this month is the first of a multiple-installment essay penned by none other than our Channeling, UFOs ... etc. polemicist in response to the inqujr of H.J. several months ago in the LETTERS-TO-THE-EDI- TOR column re the \"Who, What, When, Where, How and Why\" of the \"negative beings\". In order to understand how an ostensibly benign providence can--and does--allow for the existence of truly negative beings (i.e. spiritually negative personality-expressions fully con- scious in the direction of their preferred orientation and so beyond psychologically \"subconscious\" reactivity) it's necessary to understand something re the How and Why, the character, quality, purpose and destiny of Existence altogether. How may we understand what \"negative beings\" might be when we're vague re principles of positive being--and the possible significance adhering to either designation. To bring light to this basic concern, let's resort for a minute to what is by now a standard fiction scenario. We're all familiat with the storyline about some futuristic utopia, in which citizens are supplied their every want and catered their every need automatically by a self-maintaining machinery, a cybernetic source centrally installed by a race or intelligence long removed from the scene. No one really knows how this incredible wish-fulfilling machinery was established, or exactly when; its origin is clouded by time and the inevitable myth-making process; nor, more significantly, does anyone really care-for as long as all wants are automatically fulfilled from cradle to grave (an extended and self-satisfied passage, in this fiamework) no one ever has sufEicient incentive to question it. Obviously, the basic characteristics of finitude and therefore of potential division and deprivation are present; beings exist the corporeal condition. But this potential is never strained. It's never drawn out in any of its darker implications so as to require examination into its character, since the hungers of its delimiting orifices are satisfied virtually before the fact. As a consequence, the deeper potentials inherent in that condition of centralist self-enclosure are never activated. There is no stimulus \"permitted\" of a sufficiently acute or protracted disturbance to excite the motivation. Such a familiar \"fiction\" is virtually identical to the real state of existence established through previous Logoic pattems. What are \"previous Logoic pattern\"? If we've thus far followed Mother Terasu's cosmogonic and metaphysical analysis in the ongoing series \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness'?\", we should be familiar already with certain basic principles informing the concept of Logos. Everybody's Heard About The Word \"Logos\" of course is an ancient designation found, in one form or another, in all traditional cultures regardless their separations by factors of space and time (certainly many of these"},{"pageNumber":1037,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV parallel originations could never have borrowed against each other). This suggests something of universality inhering in the idea of Logos, or Word; and indeed we may identify the basic sense of \"logos\" as that not only of sound, but of intelligible sound. Word isn't just utterance but' is implicitly meaningfir1 utterance possessing identity, coherence, reference and internal self-consistency. We may think of the Chladnipattems created by variable vibration of randomly-distrib- uted granules on a conducting plate with a tuning fork. The sound visibly marshals symmetric arrangements, distinct geometries shifting and kaleidoscopically reforming with variations in tuning vibration or angular position of the contact. This coherent sound-patterning, or Word, may be conceived as \"declaring\" coordinates of a subtle energy-network sifting interference planes in alignment of a stylized perceptual grid--a basic system of compound foci \"triangulated\" through allowable variations within a key vibratory range. Such an energy-network would be distributed (with respect to this unitive range) as a coaxial pattem of interlocking fields fonning a nested order of dimensions, states and psychically meaningful or self-re>rring values. The homogenous extension or drawn-out \"seam\" through which such vibrational pattern issues, serves to align an identity-axis as common medium moderating, unifling while extensively surpassing the properties of provisional identity-investment polarized from its resolving juncture. It assumes the functional thread of self-reflective Consciousness focused in or through any zone of the vertical structure, according to variable patterns of perceptuaVcognitive alignment. (For an extended discussion of this \"Logos\" or cosmogonic pattern, its implication with respect to worlds, states, energy physics etc. consult the ongoing essay \"What Is 'Christ Consciousness'?\".) The Word Is The Bird, Oh Oh The Bird We may say any given, Logoic expression constitutes one such key range in the unitive identity of a patterning complex. It may be modeled as a multidimensional crystal which, in its ''frozen\" form, displays a transparency of coinvolved planes and stylized facets describing the extensive limits through which any arrangement within its worlds may be conducted. Each Logoic framework is, ultimately, an ideofoxm pattern; each such pattern may be summed as an experimental screen through which primary Conscious value potentially awakens to Itself, according to conditions more-or-less efficient as a test of Its Absoluteness under ultimate challenge of Its own all-permissive power of creative delimitation. Thus each Logoic pattern furnishes the cosmic venue of such test. Each such pattern establishes the conditions whereby that test is conducted in practice. Each such pattern serves to distill the lessons inherent in its own organizational potential. Such lessons are conserved as seed impressions, abstract-ideoform residue of all that \"takes place\" within the allowable framework of the Logoic whole. This residue serves to supply the underlying premises and initiating, motivational momentum of the \"next\" Logoic pattern in the line of progression. This brings us back to our utopian scenario. Let's suppose thaf in the Mework of the pattern previous to and thus \"underlying\" our own Logoic pattern such utopian situation actually characterized the condition in which beings existed. The basis of finitude and limitation, as previously noted, would certainly be operative. All beings would polarize to mutual appearance through common denominator of the universal convergence-axis; as a consequence, all beings would wake up to a \"vehicular\" condition of centralist self-reference generating systems of interdependent faculties and functions. At the same time, there'd be a kind of biophysical parallel"},{"pageNumber":1038,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV of the \"automatic\" machineries operating within this utopian context. The stylized limits of a \"physically\" focused existence would be compensated spontaneously by the overall translucency in which such state was practically conducted. Conditions of \"limit\" and nascent enclosure are here merely formal points-ofdeparture for intenelated fuzictions, equally available, taking meaning fiom an instrumental power to bridge potential gaps, close potential fissure$-of-being by spontaneous psychic economy. In this previous Logoic pattern such mediating mind-body powers aren't masked; their very existence isn't in question as is the existence of similarpsi forces, telekinetic powers etc. within our Logoic framework. In context of the previous pattem (underlying and informing ours) such physical faculties modeling potentially opaque planes of barrier and limit tend to be overtly supplemented, unquestioningly supported by the natural coexistence of energy-fields and related instruments immediately available to fill the breaks or lags othemise intervening between a desire and its \"distant\" object. Imagine what a whole world of beings would be like, equipped with taken-for-granted faculties such as those exhibited by sorcerers of the Castaneda saga, where no distance was too great to seal, no barrier too tough to be pierced. This condition of the previous Logoic pattem existed since it hadn't yet \"occurred\" to Creative Intelligence to decisively mask the void-character of its own nature or whole Identity; the various interpenetrating fields through which beings functioned didn't yet screen but basically conducted one another according to a connective program. As with our \"fictional\" scenario, however, this gratuitously permissive and self-fulfill- ing order of things didn't supply sufficient pressure to provoke the development of latent poten- tial-4.e. those necessarily recessed dimensions of the Being comprising the marrow and \"morrow\" of the total pattem, the resolving magnitudes of Identity and spiritual insight whereby the value of the Whole is directly recovered and functionally known beyond the focused terms of Mest life. Thus the calculus of particular inefficiencies belonging to the previous Pattern may be located in just this idyllic condition of automatic formal fulfihents nnullifying the need of decision, short-circuiting the centrality of will. We may find echoes of this previous Logoic pattem in the myths of Eden, of Guyomart and Yggdrasil. Development in this context proves agonizingly slow, if at all. In this way the underlying preparation of the \"succeeding\" Logos incorporates the idea of a more potent and efficient catalyst (cf. our favorite channeled Source, the Ra material, for a preliminary discussion of \"catalyst\"). The requirements for such an ultimate or resolving Awakening, are of course already understood. If You But Knew-it, You Had-it What's ever required is a threshold intensification of alignment and coherent, instru- mental integration (congruent with the conscious axis) in order that the value of consciousness take precedence over identification with any instrumental complex or field. \"Edenic\" conditions such as those of the previous Logoic pattem or present 4th density existence (see Channeling, UFOs ... etc. issues 0ct.-Nov. '89, 7NTC for discussion of the \"densities\") in which the subject overtly enjoys a kind of easy \"tentacular\" connectedness of organized energy-physiologies with the greater whole, do not in themselves furnish the degree of integral intensificatiodalignment drawing Consciousness into contemplative precedence over the linking psychic network. The requisite degree of whole-be-"},{"pageNumber":1039,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV ing intensity involves fully potentiating the critical void-symmetry between manifest and non-manifest phases of the psychic whole (rather than simply within the manifest context of the perceptual field, which' is strictly a function of mechanical agencies requiring only the excitation of cognitive coordinates to the limit of adjustive parity between specific and implicit values, between particular and abstract--i.e. recessed-proper- ties). This latter situation describes the minimal, governing basis of the previous Logoic order as well as the current state of 4th density existence within our own hework; in itself it represents the degree of being-in- tensity correlating the focal field with fixed awareness of the psychic mid-zone, where imagination toes the balance of perceptuaVcognitive process in a waking- dreamstate. By contrast, the principal set of require- ments invokes a necessary quality of Insight that is never automatic, and may never serve as the gratis background of any field of existence (though its \"place\" is always reserved within every Logoic pat- tern); it comprises the pznpose of the creative process altogether, depends on the variable value of will and therefore nets a quality of being, a dimension or \"mag- nitude\" of consciousness which can be considered new (rather than strictly preformed and waiting like sets of faculties on the shelf, through the field of \"eternal potential\"). In order for any such requirements to be realized there must be a factor of ficient stimulation to catalyze a commensurate interest-level for consciousness; there must be something that accelerates the desire of consciousness past the easy venue of its instrumental fulfillments, upping the ante on its identity-investment to the degree that all substitute or symbolic satisfactions become progressively inadequate to prevent the inevitable upsurge of the underlying desire, i.e. realization of the self-identical and infinitely congruent value of Consciousness itself. For this reason the present Logoic pattern (the one for which we display inferential concern since it's the only one we \"know\") advisedly incorporates a crucial \"adversarial\" factor. The most efficient means by which to install adversity into the manifest framework is to strategically mask certain values of instrumental agency, methodically recess certain magnitudes of functional connectedness that parallel-by representation or self-symbolizing approximation--the underlying unitylimmediacy of Whole-being value. The process by which this is accomplished, is understood with reference to the \"rota- tional\" alignments and scrambling keys of the multidimensional life-current and its mutually adjustive foci as described by analogy with the Rubik's Cube in Channeling, UFOs ... etc., and which may be found characterized as the cosmogonic activity of the Saki or autonomic instrumentality of Consciousness in What Is The Mother Current?, May '90 issue.'

This \"descent\" of the primordial Sakti or serpent-force (so-called because of its hissing, sinuously electric effect when roused to notice) proffers a kind of \"temptation\", then, to the isolated ground of focus through which consciousness is fixed by subtle subconscious equations of preliminary identity-commitment. The nature of such \"temptation\" is precisely to accept the part for the whole, to focus down upon an instrumentally-restricted field of perception through stylistically delimiting coordinates and lock in the whole value of consciousness (through which any such field complexly polarizei) to an objectively triangulated model of the totality. The temptation is to equate the totality (i.e. Consciousness itself) with a locally modeled rej;lection or symbolic self-representation, on a one-to-one basis. If You But Had-it, You Knew-it It goes without saying---^^ we'll say it--that this is the significance of the serpent- tempter in the garden of Eden. The apple represents the modeling of wholeness, which is literalized and accepted as satisfactory substitution for the whole-consciousness~ugh the act of intimate participation; the gesture of \"biting into\" the apple is equivalent of buying the equation of identity being inferentially offered. The invitation of the encoiling, dowdlowing serpent winding across the bole of the Tree of Life-4.e. cerebrospinal axis, the central channel4s precisely that of intimate identrtcation with a fals@ing abstraction. \"Intimate identification\" is signified by the act of actually ingesting, thereby incorpo- rating or \"introjecting\", the fragmental piece; this \"concrete\" or literalist act is at the same time a falsifying abstraction since it results in the real disappearance or removing \"abstraction\" of the whole (consciousness, modeled by the apple) fiom overt recognition. \"Eve\" bites the apple since by perennial symbol the female gender stands for the Sakti, i.e. the autonomic/subconscious processes. This however shows that ancient initiates meant to demonstrate, by their Edenic parable, the innocence of the initial \"fall\". Rather than being the guilt-generating process of inherited culpability into which it's been distorted by power-politics of religious institutionalism, this initial \"fall\" is plainly depicted as a no-fault assurance claim against any such personal liability! The equations of \"part for the whole\", which procedurally focusdown and delimit consciousness through an ingenious network of mutually filtering coordinates rotated at oblique~ultidim~ional'y.bles across the cerebrospinal \"bole\", are in this initial process of stylistic screening conducted by the collective impersonality of subconscious identity-invest- ments; they are more the product of a deep impersonal soul experimentation in which a whole life-wave of potential consciousness-units is submitted to testable terms of a provisional identity commitment, the whole-hearted buying of which is indispensably crucial to the ultimate validity of the experiment! It is then a \"Divine setup\" from the beginning, over which--in its formative or extroverting phases--the subject-mind has no effective choice. The point of such an experimental pattern is indeed to develop the faculty of \"choice\", i.e. to bring the respective merits of Conscious"},{"pageNumber":1041,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV whole-being and its substitutive identity investments into progressively clearer contrast so as to constitute a true subject of Discrimination (\"buddhi\" in Eastern terminology). This fact, however, should immediately lead us by clicking-intuitive connections to the necessary presence of negative potential (or conscious evil) in the context of this Logoic pattern. For if, as has been explained, the object of the pattern's \"masking\" element is to draw consciousness to the crisis of self-reflective discrimination, we must infer that Consciousness is innately capable- once faced with the clear terms--of opting for an informed continuation of the (reductive) process of ego-identity every bit as much as it is able to submit the organizational term of ego-identity to resolving implication of the greater Whole. Such an informed continuation of centripetal ego-identity, however, necessarily com- prises a qualitatively different proposition. It entails the continuation of self-enclosed egoity as a conscious or fully willed (deliberate) modality. It is therefore \"fk\" of its initial and motivating innocence through primordial subconscious equations. In the same way because it is, from that ideal juncture, a conscious or willed determina- tion founded on clear comparison with the Holism of Being revealed as an earned disclosure, it's henceforth deliberately prosecuted in all its negative implications on that Ground. It may thereafter use and function through the fielddenergies of instrumental holism, made available on the basis of that threshold intensity in the kindling of integral Recognition. \"Wait a minute!\" we hear many (previously educated in theosophies and esoteric spiritualities) protest at this point: \"I've been led to understand that, once the mind is brought to perceive the virtue of Whole-value Consciousness the very blessedness and clear superiority of that noumenal truth automatically causes all nominal 'alternatives' to pale into dysfunctional insignifi- cance! Now I'm being told that mind has no such obligation, and is not necessarily persuaded to the point of being overwhelmed and definitively talked out of all further egoity by the seIf-evident superiority of the Whole-conscious Truth?\" That's right. \"Then how can this be?\" Hidden Worm-HOLES In The Cosmic Apple The perennial conficsion lies partly in the old esoteric parables and metaphors them- selves. We've heard over and over again how Bacchus was shredded by the Titans, how Osiris was thoroughly dismembered and scattered to the far comers by Set etc. These handy types for the polarized focudforeshortening of available Conscious magnitude, obviously infer that Conscious- ness (the my-hc \"hero\" whether Dionysus or Adonis, Hiram Abiff or Christian Rosenkranz) is Itself somehow hgmented and literally partitioned in the cosmogonic process. This is not, however, strictly true, and only yields to a more \"philosophic\" or expository description. We have in fact already seen in our present characterization how consciousness comes to its \"fragmental\" identities not by an internal self-division but by investment of its whole-value Identity in one-to-one equations with contrastively modeled terms. Consciousness is not, in the present 3rd densiry state, directly aware of its own indivisible whole-value due to reductive identification with abstractly isolated terms or descriptive features (i.e. the myriad qualifying \"predicates\" to its singular Subject-self); it has effectually invested its undiminished whole-value in such delimiting magnitudes, thereby loaning the quality of wholeness or self-sufficiency to them. Since it's a borrowed value of wholeness and self-sufficiency, of course, all such abstracted"},{"pageNumber":1042,"pageContent":"MATRIX 1V magnitudes of identity-investment are provisional, and owing to their practical conditionality continuously participate in processes of synthesis, polar interchange, reversal or general mutation. Precisely because of these habituated identity-investments in which a conditional model is equated with the unconditional whole, however,'there9s developed through the record of every soul a history of practiced afinity with such patterns. As Exhibit A, reflect on how dear is identification with the pettiest point of one's own ego-profile (a type of inventory in itself simply a habit-pattern of cumulativelchangeable items taken to correspond to the \"I\" on a one-to-one basis). Even understanding this, it's hard to follow out any reasoned assessment of what's \"petty\" since the tiniest item by proportional measure supports an extravagant subjective architecture, complexly mapped with daedaiian implication across the whole psychic maze. This obvious reluctance to dissociate the \"I \"-ness (or Self-coming to itself) of conscious- ness from the inventory of its chronic ego-profile punctuates the existence of an ongoing if covert romance, i.e. precisely the devotion of Love--the emotional correlative of whole-value conscious- nessdoward conditional patterns of identity consistently proving to be sources of sufering and consternation (owing to the real lack of correspondence between their reductive dimensions and the limitless whole-value of Consciousness itself). Note To Sub-head Skimmers-Here's The Good Park Guilty Love, Forbidden Romance! This romance takes much of its provisional pleasure fiom its covert character (i.e. such an actually verboten equation between incompatibles takes place below the dace of self-conscious apprehension, so the sources of suffering men 't clearly identified as attributes to which the seifness of Consciousness is attached; therefore there inevitably arises, in the psychic \"chancery\" of every soul, a delicious confusion of pleasure with pain owing to the self-same origin of both qualities as polar expressions of the committed Love-nature). This equation becomes a satisfactory surrogate of the Love-nature to the dedicatedly negative personality-expression; for such an orientation learns to \"compartmentalize\" the inextri- cable strand of pain in iniiction of suffering, so as to regulate the refkctory realm of Other as servitor of \"pleasure\" or satisfaction-fulfillment to the ego-self. This committed investment of the Love-nature doesn't automatically evaporate when (as may happen at a critical degree of integrationhlignment with the conscious Axis) it's recognized such an insular abstraction as the ego-self with its inventory of identified attributes owes its continuity to a confused equation with Whole-being value. On the contrary, single-minded devotion to such sealed self-definition characteristic of the negatively developing soul simply finds unex- pected grace in the critical gratuity that painful hgmentisms of delimiting identity-investment are not a defining feature of consciousness itself? The \"I\", so the ego-soul discovers, is not in fact defined by or restricted to an actual LLevent\" in consciousness that has taken place, such as an internal subdivision that has to be \"repaired\". Rather, the exploitable fact is that consciousness itself is forever whole, and may makeis pee to make--provisional identity-investments in insularly enclosed, abstract ego magnitudes proven to possess their own unique pleasures and possibilities (pleasures and possibilities, moreover, found under psychic searchlight to derive"},{"pageNumber":1043,"pageContent":"MATRIX N precisely from the furtive character of their implicitly verboten equations between incompatible orders of Being). Having added the dimension of knowledge-recognition to this previously subconscious state of things, the devotedly negative personality proposesprecisely to have its cake and eat it too. It may at the same time benefit by an explicit whole value of consciousness, newly abstracted from painfully-ambivalent ego equations while having available to it the expanded densities of energy- organization compatible with its recovered \"cosmic\" proportions; and may persist as well in the mode of manipulative projection formerly characterizing subcomcious psychic equations, now Nly known under the conscious whole-light so as to enjoy a will-of-the-wisp evasiveness with respect to ordinary contradictions of the delimited ego-identity (between the poles of which the conventional ego is periodically crushed). It's for this reason that, once posirively-polarized consciousness comes to the glorious gateway of the Paradise state (i.e. 4th density mind/body existence) it nonetheless detects a persistent negarive presence in that range as well, where it would not necessarily have expected so contrary a condition of psychic polarity to survive. This extension of the adversarial proposition past mere accentuated survivalisms of (selectively-screened or stylistically masked) 3rd-density existence, brings forward an important set of implications for the present Logoic pattern discussed in our next installment."},{"pageNumber":1044,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV arshpll Telema by Marshall Telemachus PART II In part I of LogosIAnti-logos, the question was asked regarding why such a thing as \"negativity\" in the spiritual sense of evil is allowed, and we discovered that previous Logoic pattems existed (prior to the present one we identify parochially as Reality) through which the lesson was learned re easy fulfillments of instrumental needs in the context of a given fi-amework of Identifi- cation. Such comparatively easy access to the inbuilt mechanical means of achieving these fdfihents, had the unanticipated effect of diluting the drive toward full \"recovery\" of Absolute- value (belonging to Consciousness per se) as the whole of Identity independent of perceptual and experiential venues. Although the true object of the Creative potential of Being is never modified, it is critically masked by just the circumstance of mechanically-effortless fulfillments satisfying struc- tural conditions of interdependence belonging to the given Logoic pattern. Ironically, the. gratis character of the instrumental \"enforcements\" or functional parallelisms of Unity and whole-being Identity on a finite scale serve to obscure the basic requirement of the Creative pattern, i.e. that of functionally recovering the whole-being value of Identity directly. Such an obscured object nonetheless remainsthe basic purpose of any Logoic framework since the limitless value of Absolute infomy inspirits and serves as the unitive organizational basis for any such wework thereby drawing all potential consciousness Imits (through inbuilt structural drives and modeled correspondences) toward the ultimately-irresistible amplitude of their own, awaiting Wholeness beyond any delibiting definition or profile of identification. Awakening across the whole of the Self-reflective axis, such a realized value of Consciousness would then constitute a kind of novelty or actual \"addition\" to what otherwise remains a preexistent plethora of potential covering all bases in \"advance\" without prospect of surprise. Each such awakened \"addition\" to the irreducible value of Conscious Whole-being then comprises a net increase in the available power by which the Creative can \"up the ante\" on Its Logoic expression through a projected framework. The \"sum\" of learning derived from the pattems through which the wave of consciousness-units works is ultimately netted and drawn in as the cumulative residue of nature-impressions deposited in the Eidetic record, to be incorporated in the succeeding Logos according to a \"refined\" pattern serving ideally to resolve the roughness characterizing the \"highest polish\" of which they were formerly capable; and whatever bouquets of Consciousness were blossomed in the course of that conditional learning enter into and enhance the numen of Intelligent Whole-being presiding over and as the next Logoic Issue. The harvested \"successes\" in terms of Oversoul consciousness are merged into the Value of Being to which they collectively correspond, i.e. the ineffable Whole-being Intensity of Absolute, where (as far as can be told) an absolute increase in Conscious \"capacitance\" meets the moveless Eternality of All where nothing Ever takes place--nothing comes or goes, rises or falls"},{"pageNumber":1045,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV that's not already anticipated to the degree of profound needlessness. (It is then out of such happy Gratuity the ineluctable principles, processes and prospects of the succeeding Logoic pattern propaiwe-) The Trouble With Paradise What the slow-drawn satisfactions in the lazy \"Southern afternoon\" of that former Logoic pattern served to obscure, then, was the ultimate Requirement of Whole-being awareness awakened beyond delimited identification with any functional hework; thus if one such me- work already served (at a given point of selfconscious \"upsurge\" in the context of untested soul-identification) to satisfy structural requirements with minimum effort or sharpened concern on the part of the personality, the need to dig more deeply into the character of spiritud Requirements with respect to Existence altogether was proportionately damped. The wisdom of recovering the Whole and direct value of Absolute spirit-consciousness beyond the delimiting horizon-lines of even the most contextually \"satisfactory\" of fields, tended to be lost to a consciousness only vaguely bothered by its own greater Themes at the tapered margins of apprehension. The advisability of reclaiming directly the value of whole-being Consciousness good as negotiable currency in any plane, state or dimension of being--comprising the universal Key for any bework of cognition- seemed constantly undercut and deprived of the critical degree of necessity that would bring its latent business to a visible boil. We found out last time, therefore, how it was determined that the best way to bring those recessed dimensions of ultimate spiritual Moment to the fore was to maskcertain critical magnitudes of instrumentalfirnction within the fi.amework of the Logoic field. By functionally recessing or \"screening\" fiom direct availability those powers, properties or facultative keys which served to suavely bridge all potential disjunctions of the polarized field, instantaneously weld all nascent separations appearing through the cracks or contrastive properties of \"space\" and \"time\", the crucial factor of adversiw would be potentiated and drawn forward as a central concern of conditional existence. In the \"former\" Logoic pattern of things, the polarized manifestation of the field of experience necessarily produced an order of centralizing self-reference through which were organ- ized the vague outlines of a venue modeling \"separation\", \"disjunction\" and delayed satisfactions immediately 'Piled in\" or vividy compensated by intervening networks of energies and their corresponding, facultative systems serving to link or elliptically join diverse coordinates. Such a \"former\" Logoic order was the basic field of experience into which the fieshly-awakened cell of self-reflective consciousness practically stepped; and it corresponded in the general \"density\" of its energy-saturation and interlocking, instrumental grids, to the present state of 4th density-being as characterized in this (present) Logoic pattern. Thus it may be seen that, in the former pattem, what we know of presently and are familiar with as our current 3rd density state of self-reflective consciousness didn't exist. 4th density wasn't earned, but was given gratis as automatic birthright'of the selfconsciously awakened unit (certain parallels with the religious myths of \"Eden\", etc. are quite clear). In the former order of things, what we know of as mineral level (1st density) and vegetablelanimal level (2nd density) were directly linked with the human level .of self-reflective consciousness presently characterized as 4th density, in which the unity, kinship, identity and spiritual wholeness of all things was immediately evident and comprised afirnctional datum. There was no intervening level (what we"},{"pageNumber":1046,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV presently know of as \"3rd density\") in which functional data centered on the problematic postulate of \"infinite separation\", \"self-isolation\" and \"irreconcilable distinction\". Thus in order for the present Logoic pattern of the densities, dimensions and worlds to come about as a \"progression\" on the artifice of leacning, it was necessary for the levels of organization to be dropped a whole-stop from the principal demesne of the \"self nucleating\" psyche first angling into the created realms. The innate variability of the compound focal coordinates through which dimensional grid-networks were practically polarized, was drawn upon to functionally screen critical magnitudes of potential from direct cognition at a certainhreshold-level of conscious resolution. In this way the \"first\" level to which the unit of consciousness would practically awaken as a fkshly self-reflective psyche, was that of strongly polarized and stylistically filtered 3rd density. The process of \"screening\" by which the third stage of development is polarized-out between what are now 2nd and 4th densities respectively, effectually reduces the \"richness\" of a given volume. 'This means that the saturation-level of a volume with respect to the co-involved fields or patterning coordinates optimally possible, is practically filtered so that a critical magnitude is reduced to indirect participation. Such indirect or \"oblique\" alignment strategically limits the instrumental properties cognitively available by convention, so that taken-for-granted abilities of psi-force, elastic powers of the subtle \"tissue-capsule\" characteristic of a 4th density state are systematically screened and retired to the sidelines where they constitute ambiguous twilight modes - capable indeed of being doubted altogether. 3rd density, then, comprises an artificial reduction in available state-intensity of the total (multidimensional) system focused to a highly stylized, masked framework. How may we understand this \"reduction in intensity\"? How would such a thing manifest itself as a practical matter? Why The Phenomenology Of Being Is Un-becoming We may compare the subjective state of the infant in 3rd density to the primary being of 4th density. Through this instructive comparison we can question ourselves as to the manner in which infant consciousness initially apprehends its own presence. First of all we have to slip beneath the canvas of enculturation covering the \"adult\" mind; for that mind perceives the subject by schematic self-representation or modeled artifice. We must forget apprehension of our \"self' through imagistically diluted extremes of the abstract tenses, flickering between a determined \"past\" and indeterminate \"future\" being. We must forget the conceptual, verbal-abstract language by which we isolate objects of perception to a reductive, piecemeal linear focus schematically \"distanced\" fiom the digital grasp by which they're instrumentally oriented and gauged. We must recognize that the perception, cognition and experience of qualities through the manifesting pattern is first of all a selfaisclosure, a revelation of the potential modes by which being makes itself known. The gooiness of maple as it oozes down the countertop, the pliabiliw and floury grit of dough, the visual and tactile resistance in the angularity of a chair, etc. are not first of all modes through which some category antithetically polar to ourselves is indexed; rather, the phenomenology of all experience is aparticipatoly pattern \"lighting up\" the inexhaustible modeling of the selfhood that experiences. One's perception of the ball across the woolly rug, the lamp out of reach at the top of the table, is not first of all a defining expression of removal and identity-sepa- ration or contrast. There is no imagistic internal \"self' (juggled between the inexistent-abstract"},{"pageNumber":1047,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV tenses) which comprises a distinct \"subject\"; that ball and that lamp occur in the immediacy of the selfiood of awareness; that selfhood occurs nowhere and at no time other than in the non-temporal- ized present. Such a \"present\" state is not then a tense'but a totality through which any temporalizing polar abstraction arises, and upon which the tenses converge (rather than \"flow through\", in the conventional sense of a stream or directional arrow). The subject of apprehension (or \"self\" of awareness) is practically constituted through the patterns of perception and their elicited qualities contingently occasioningthat Presence. All such phenomenological \"unfolding\" serves to comprise the condition of the subject, so that the experiencing \"self' can be none other than the sensations and impressions by which it immediately comes to itself. No sensation or impression, while contributing to the immediate upsurge of the \"self ', completely absorbs and accounts for that self-presence. Such presence is given through and as the impression but isn't contained by it and so flows over, around and indeterminately beyond it. The specificity of the \"object\" as which the self is given, is complemented by the indete-y of its total presence which is neverportrayed and so continuously escapes the conditional terms by which it's phenomenologically defined or \"interpreted\" to itself. In flowing over, around and infinitely beyond the given phenomenon, the value of awareness through which it arises implicitly comes to and closes with itself: It is then, by virtue of its immediate awareness of the phenomenological field, implicitly aware of itself: And even though this awareness later becomes interpreted by abstract reflection in terms of an objectively outlined subject (the self-image etc.) it exists initially as a simple and dTicient awareness without compul- sive, correlative object. Conventional academiaviews the infant psyche as exclusively vital; it describes the state of infancy as a bundle of primitive drives, a rudimentary register of physical sensations. This misconception is only perpetuated by commentators such as Kenneth Wilber who attempt to straddle the line of academic acceptability and vanguard \"human potentials\", managing thereby to improve neither. Such effort to integrate the conventional academic description-produced through the parsimony of standardizing consensus-with principles of \"alternative\" perception only serve to falsify all the coinvolved considerations of the Field, proving merely that those like Wilber had prematurely cashed in their chips on an initial insight so as to parlay quick gains into consensual validation (rather than waive early rewards for the depth of original investigation required to do justice to a Topic that doesn't conform, in its implications, with precepts gathered to support a variant psychological system). Indeed to propose that infant cognition begins as exclusively vital-physical is a petitio principii; it accepts without reflection the \"basal\" reality of vital-physical being and the primacy of \"material\" sensation as if that were something more substantial than a concept. It already implicitly declares the \"basal\" reality from which everything else must dependently spring, so that any hypothesis taking this academic convention for granted has already cast its lot with the prevailing viewpoint regardless where it purports to \"lead\" fiom there. It must be recognized that an emphasis on medullary activities in infant stages evidencing early efforts toward mastering coordination and balance with respect to drives or appetites of the vital nature, is not equivalent to the presumption that early childhood is strictly \"material\" or vital-physical. Vital-physical being is a \"doctrine\"; material sensation is conceptual. It is a complex self-reflective pronouncement on being, not a primary observation on being. It reflects certain values"},{"pageNumber":1048,"pageContent":"to which the psyche is instrumentally conditioned. Prior to the \"taking\" of such instrumental conditioning, the infant psyche makes no such sophisticated discrimination. The contents of its impressions are ideoform; the whole-value of percipient-identity instills the processes of perception as tendency toward the discriminative cognition of unities. It's The Thought That Matters Isn't the \"debate\" between realism (phenomenalism) and idealism part of an intermina- ble philosophical history-fiom Plato and Aristotle through Hume, Berkeley, Kant and the existentialists-which, if anything, gives tacit philosophical proof toward an arbitrary equivalency in the assumption of viewpoints leaving the whole field more a demonstration of mind's double-vi- sion (particlefwave dualism etc.) than a casebook in the dialectic triangulation of truth? Not really. Phenomenal realism and epistemological idealism have never stood on equal footing regardless who championed what at any given time. There's an uncrossable paradox standing in the way, like a one-way mirror that seems to have two sides but permits reflection only over a single surfhce. There may seem to be a sphere of sensations and impressions \"first\" which becomes subsequently interpreted according to a profusion of conceptual models; yet the idenhi- cation of any such sphere as a primary or irreducible datum is problematic. The discrimination of an impression or particulate phenomenon is a synthetic and complex act. It requires an analytic faculty and a unitive faculty. The identification of any such theoretical \"sphere\" is therefore an ideative function in the fhst place. Do you see how there's no equally compromising implication attaching to the \"criticism\" that the determination of idea likewise requires analytic and unitive faculties? On the other hand, naming idea as the operative principle is a class of observation belonging to the charmed circle of general self-reference (i-e. a system monitoring itself, a categorical negative applied to itself) which manages to aErm itself either through affirmation or negation. It tends to funnel everything eventually toward that same pons asinom where all paradoxes and problematic postulates come to rest as peculiarities of mind, i.e. the condition of conscious existence. It belongs to the same irreducible Circumstance that produces the Klein bottie and Moebius strip; the Escher paradoxes; the indeterminacy principle; and the curious finding of physics that, \"counter-intuitively\", there can be no parity between observational quanta and the observer (i.e. the \"observer\" must remain at the level of classic description where there is \"already\" an operative order of instruments and intentions, an indivisible macroscopy of intelligible form without reference to any substructure since a \"quantized\" observer, taken strictly as a function of the probability-wave, keeps the state-vector in indejinite suspension preventing the calculations that collapse it. The \"subject\" or observer-consciousness cannot be co-opted to the order of \"materia\". For apparent, special-order exceptions in \"abnonnal\" physics which prove extensions of the case, see \"What Is Physics?\"). The postulating of \"objective independence\" (i.e. the world is first of all \"matter\") only aflrms psychic inherence, in a way that the proposal of an ideoform reality clearly avoids with respect to the apotheosis of phenomenalism. One must ask in what manner the \"persuasive\" physical evidences of bedrock resis- tance, inertia, opacity and dzxerential pressure characteristic of the \"material\" category occur in the first place. The sensation of resistance in our fingertips as we squeeze a chunk of anthracite, doesn't assemble itself piecemeal as an \"effect\" from an infinitely divisible set of rudimentary"},{"pageNumber":1049,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV impressions ad infinitum. Whether we postulate the sensation as a product of \"neurological processes\" or quantum-screening etc. we haven't succeeded in accounting for it in the least, since we haven't accounted for the reductive data; what is the essence of \"quanta\", \"neurological process\" etc.? They are at best self-representations of8 process through which their very descriptive potentia comes already patterned \"behind the scenes\", so that they can only be known through the field they constitute (i.e. they could be wholly dissimilar to the patterns they prepare toward perceptible configuration as a function of observer-consciousness). Regardless how we observe and classify the processes of phenomenalism objectively, however, their spirit-4.e. the essence of their expression--is that of a unitive self-disclosure instantaneously yielding meaning, internally self-consistent quality and value as a function of observer-consciousness. There is the strong a priori or essential tendency of being toward unity, internal self-congruence through all contributory qualities, the disclosure of value with relevance to the observational process, and meaning as a term of psychic coherence. A Meaningful Matter Of The Un-likely Likeness: Mirroring The Reflective Term Such meaning isn't an abitrary endowment, or capricious injection into the experience from some fieefloating quicksilver spirit. Meaning emerges organically, as a function of the very values through which its phenomenology comes to expression. For instance, the basic state of psychic indeterminacy comprising background allowance and eliciting-agent of all-variably determinable-meanings through the cognitive field, doesn 't subsist as a noncomittal presence without integral part in the specific, phenomenological development (like an arbitrary labeler of sign or charge); rather, it constitutes an effective framework for evaluative reference prior to any consideration of contrastive qualities in the phenomenological field. We may understand it in this way: Psychic self-apprehension takes the implicit form of an siF, indeterminacy; a differential ambiguity; an objective imprecision or subjective constancy; an insubstantiality and continuous seIf-surpassing (as opposed to rigid fixity). Thus the ideotypes of \"inertia\", \"resistance\" and \"opacity\" charac- teristic of material phenomenalism, take their being as contrastive potential through the selfchar- acterizing qualities of a Psychic reality. The types of \"material phenomenalism\" are given as the internal potential for self-negation4r theoretical self-contradiction-belonging to the unrestricted potentia of Psyche. Such \"material\" typologies are therefore contrastive with that value-in-itself by content (i-e. substantivelinsubstantial, resistivelfluid etc.); while they are necessarily given as that value by form, and are therefore indistinct from it: the charmed order of general self-reference. They are psychic categories (without any way around that fact), ultimately ~ymbolic to the presiding conscious Standard of ideal self-congruence and uninterrupted Self-continuity, or homogenous identity. The most \"fhgmental\" and \"primitive\" impressions (in the reductively-diagrammatic sense of categorial minim) are characterized by the strong inbuilt tendency to \"group\", cohere, differentiate into a unitive phenomenology outlining the persistent presence of the whole-value of identity. Through the informing spirit of (unitive or whole) abstract-indeterminate Identity consti- tuting the being of percipient-consciousness, the infant psyche continuously turns up provisional"},{"pageNumber":1050,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV identities in the phenomenal field. Such impressions are ideofonn from the beginning. Whether they later become complexly identified and differentiated by secondary processes as \"material\", it is no such petitio principii to recognize them as functions of idea; for the phenomenological field disclosing itself through the differential focus of percipient-consciousness persistently organizes by tendency toward wholes, unities, coherent values, integral qualities (i.e. qualities disclosing a unitive meaning or distinct intelligibility through diverse contributing properties). Such ideoform process is pre-reflective, and therefore primary, because it doesn't depend on and is prior to the abstraction of a distilled conceptj?om the field of impressions. Rather, that field unfolds in immediate ideoform manner without having to be \"assembled\" (except secondarily, through subsequent conventions of learning calculated to extract specific, prehensile categories); it merges and emerges through fluctuating focus toward discrete typologies, interchang- ing, overlapping and unstably shifting perhaps but immediately given to patterned ensembles without reflective reconstruction or piecemeal constitution. In this primary field of the infat psyche there has yet to be made the type of conceptual and thus abstracting, artificially differentiating reduction through which a \"physical\" world is filtered; thus there's no exclusive, stylized fixation of the delimited coordinates-of-attention toward mechanically instrumental cues. Perception isn't limited to narrowly qualifying objects. Becoming As Little Children Again (Re-member \"Me\") If we could recover awareness of the childhood psyche directly (as is possible through initiated consciousness) rather than rely on standardized categories taken for granted in the manner of naive realism, we'd find ourselves back in a world where the outline of the \"3-dimensional\" pattern (later drawn forward) exists through a men- struum of superposed impressions, subtle lights and phantom forms never acknow- ledged by the conditioning \"mind of encul- turation\" walking in and out of the room in the person of various agencies. We'd find that there was not only a medium of perception through which the defining terns of a later \"objectivity\" could be modeled, but a general flotational expanse cross-cut with numerous dimen- sional powers and properties; through the informed reflection of Initiated conscious- ness we'd be able to identify patterns, ener- gies, fields and forces belonging to various levels of the mindhody whole having meaning and specific significance for vari- ous levels of development."},{"pageNumber":1051,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Thus there would coexist in, through and on the patterns preened for 3-D objectivity a fiesco of perceptible content belonging to the symbolizing psyche, and having very deep long-term meaning with respect to the developmental overview of the infant-subject. Though the psyche at the developmental level of the infant would be unable to recognize it as such (perceiving its fom nonetheless as vividly as any other through the general phantasmagoria) it would belong pan' passu to coexisting levels of higher mind and supersod consciousness presently hovering \"above\" the incarnate plane, and not so integrated with it in direct manner as the operative vital-soul of the infant. It would nonetheless (through reflective inspection of Initiated awareness) disclose the intelligible presence and interaction of those related dimensions of higher consciousness currently \"superin- tending\", by evidence of organizing symbols appearing on and through the field of impressions, the timed cycles of souldevelopment carrying the incarnate destiny forward as merited guidelines. The relative \"saturation\" of the self-same spatial Wework to so high an initial power of multidimensional patterns and fields, correlates this primary condition of the infant psyche at 3rd density level with the unscreened factors and potentialities characterizing 4th density (and therefore the initial self-conscious wework characteristic of the previous Logoic pattern). If the infant psyche is, by simple virtue of its passive presence, the recipient of so much extra-normal information at a subjective level (i.e. the percipient level which would remain inaccessible to adult intelligence \"sharing the same room\"), why then isn't it equally available to activating forms of extranormal function-4.e. powers of positive production such as psychic photography or telekinesis--having an objective dimension and theoretically observable in the shared context? . Aside fiom a few anomalies that wind up more often than not \"reported\" in the Enquirer rather than discussed on Nova, there seems to be sparse exterior evidence that the infant \"inhabits\" such an initially enriched world abutting 4th-stage saturation-intensity. The character of incarnation at the 3rd density level is such that, during the phase of infancy when the percipient-consciousness is still vehicularly \"unstructured\" enough to experience phenomena of the contributory dimensions, it is at the same time functionally focused through a group of coordinates which suspend it in receptive configuration across the field of a fixed psychic form (Sheldrake's biomorphic field etc.) organized as behavioral standard or regulatory network of the collective pattern. Thus the infant is in effect held in the embrace of the parental model, and is selectively influenced at the psychic as well as overt-behavioral level to organize its voluntary functions in confomance with a highly standardized, prefigured typology. The higher dimensions of the soul-being at this stage are not yet integrated, through specific glandular sites and plexuses of the mind-body form, in sufficiently direct alignment with the incarnated portion of the vital psyche or desire-being to bring active or self-initiated values of mind, intelligence and will into operation; this phase of development awaits adolescence or the onset of puberty, to take place at its fullest available station with respect to present permissible potentials of 3rd density existence.* *Poltergeist phenomena are known to erupt at this biological juncture (i-e. erratic nonordinary behaviors of common household items not nailed-down, in proximity of some pubescent presence often \"victimized\" by the behavior). This may be understood as indicative of roughhansition between the phase of passive prepubescent inherencein the \"denser\" overall medium (or multidimensional extension) of being, and the encultumion processes through which a more active phase of will is meant to acquire its \"initiative\" at the cost of screening unaknowledged potentials from the consensual format. Owing to the denials, repressions and projections involved, the volitional component is (angrily) displaced and estranged into the objectivized phenomenon as if it were acting with independent \"disobedience\" to the norm. 1036"},{"pageNumber":1052,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV This doesn't mean the infant psyche has no mind, will or intelligence; but mind, will and intelligence are received through the patterning coordinates as indirect magnitudes at this stage, so that their \"active\" phases are engaged through thoroughly receptive forms of instnlmentation. They're absorptive and imitative, conforming subliniinslly to the pressure of that direct& active aspect of the consensual field summarizing the collective form of will in a 3rd density mework and conveying it through the elaboration of every subconscious and autonomic channel. Exercise of the voluntary or cerebrospinal channel in the hfht state has a distinctly passive cast; the \"active\" or voluntaristic element of the conscious presence (which is in fact irreducible and indispensable) is confined to the mode of \"receptivity\". Wi is equal to a reflex of the active, instrumental pattern describing the behavioral latitude of the bracketingpsyche-or operative ideotype-of the \"physical\" dimension. Thus it isn't that the infant is strictly describable as a bundle of primitive drives and vital-organic response patterns; rather, its voluntary side seems observably limited to such traits since its \"active\" phase hinges on prevailing organizational patterns already defining the allowable forms-or functional combinations40 be drawn fiom overall potentials coded through the mind-body centers as modes and field-alignments theoretically subject to the volitional dimension of the being. From the outset, then, the infant psyche is behaviorally influenced through overall typology of the field to collapse the coordinates of perception upon an instrumental 3-space or cross-sectional \"sheet\" of allowable identity-patterns, congealing an opaque surface fiom an engulfing matrix of saturation-density. In this way the infant is held in, and embraced by, the basic identity of the collective (parental) world-view with its accompanying functional implications, without fully succumbing to it by \"personal appropriation\" (that would require a more central and integrated value of Wdl than is available in the early stages). Instrumentally and as an \"extroverting\" faculty the infant-con- sciousness is quietly regulated, patterned and adjustively coordinated by summary fields composed of pfevailing types, habits, beliefs and conditioned limits. Having as yet to completely identify with such typologies (and their correlative networks of field-organization, instrumental emphasis etc.) on a one-to-one basis, the infant psyche is at the same time able to straddle a \"private\" world of perceptions, properties and forms; such unsanctioned fonm and fields, becoming progressively isolated from the processes of consensual validation or shared meaning, are proportionately neglected in their potential for coherence and organizational \"grammar\". They remain at the rudimentary level. How We Become Magicians, Shamans, Sorcerers Or Insurance Salesman This comparative \"desuetude\" or unobserved neglect is variable according to culture. Much of what we come to identify (through our psychological disciplines etc.) as dysfunctional stages of cognition experimentally moving in gradual adjustment with the \"reality principle\", are in fact signs of viable psychic organizations or alternative grammars of cognition merely kept at the half-formed stage, unable-owing to the prevailing pattern40 emerge into higher orders of consistency and instrumental integrity belonging to \"consensus\" reality."},{"pageNumber":1053,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV There is, through all phases of development, a distinct focusing toward identification with thefirnctional. Yet, what's \"functional\" possesses a greater latitude of interpretation than is generally conceded. There are styles of \"experimental\" apprehension (involving distinctly mechanical learning) that may take place while the psyche is yet absorbed in phenomenal self-disclosure as an implicit, constitutive description rather than as a deliberate masking and inversion of that mode. Some of these are known to us by cultural interpretation as \"magical\" modes of childhood thinking. Such interpretations come to us with unstated judgments thickly clinging as distortive filters, prejudicing our perceptions before the fact against whatever merit may abide in an activity of mind which is, after all, innate to the degree that we find it uniformly in childhood development and independently in tribal cultures etc. Through these fonns of cognition, perfectly instrumental in themselves though poised midway in the primary phase where phenomena are basically constitutive seIf-discIosures, there's the persistent pressure toward tipping the balance in favor of manipulative or utilitarian identifica- tions as a sacrifice of Ouroboric continuity rather than in supplementation of it. Such pressure is of course most pronounced in modem, Western patriarchal culture, so the scales are tipped most decisively in such context. Identification is progressively focused through the drives and appetites; the perceptual field and its unfolding phenomenology become extended representation (or \"sym- bol\") of the modes most intimately involved in such mechanical states. This is the basis for the Freudian \"libidinization\" of form in dream symbolism, surcharging every item as anthropic representative of some (appetitive) concavity or convexity, voluptuously everting one into the other. The tendency of the psyche toward the \"Freudian\" is afitnction of cultural descrip- tion, then, not a datum of it. At the modem extreme of this educative process, the absorptive selfdisclo- sure of phenomena collapses on the inshu- mental limits descriptively \"boxing\" phenomena as a function of prehensility. Phe- nomenology doesn't evaporate as a psychic self-disclosure, but becomes deemphasized or subordinated as an apparent incident of organic measurement. Where the fleshly tis- sue of the limbs, the lips, the fingers comes to an abrupt end on the apparently empty air, there the evidence is accepted of a real gap or fateful disjunction of being, dividing the presence of the \"percipient\" from the psy- chic modeling of perception. The readiness of such acceptance represents a practical equation of identity between the self-reflec- tive psyche, and the forms of biological in- strumentation describing the cognitive field according to the most mechanically-fore-"},{"pageNumber":1054,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV shortened agencies of stylistic measure (i.e. the prehensility of \"thumb and forefinger\", the span of the footstep or reach of the am etc.). Owing to the tight lockin of this instrumental identity-equation, a functional emptiness installs itself; a protracted hunger is generated, that is only secondarily ascribable to organic need but which basically originates in an internal disparity aggravated through the soul itself. L'Entre Nbant, (Mon Armure) In this way a significant value of negation is generated through the phenomenological field, efficiently incurred on the basis of instrumental identities; it soffly surrounds impressions as a factor to be calculated into all subsequent \"considerations\". This term of \"negation\" (a particular conjugation of the essential void-value or Common Denominator of Being) interposes a practical key of perception whereby a kind of \"objectivizing\" distance or compositional abstraction may be accomplished. In order to become functionally familiar with the myriad modes of the phenomenal field so as to cultivate increased \"reliance\" on the active or voluntary side of the sensory-motor coordinates (i.e. to bridge the gap of satisfaction that inevitably opens between mouth and breast, etc.) learning takes the form of mechanical identification-patterns; such patterns necessarily nullz> the immediate impression-formerly sufficient in itself-and instead proceed to model it across a synthetic arc of anticipation. In order to understand this process and its significance, we must ask how it is weperceive something \"simple\" like a 3dimensional block. It is of course taken for granted that this block, only three sides of which may actually be seen at any given time, possesses six equal faces forming a structure of length, width and depth. In order to represent this to ourselves as a simultaneous image, we may organize it as a perspectival transparency as with those drawings of a Necker cube. We therefore believe we \"know\" all sides as an expectant transposition of form, securing our knowledge of the figure; but the fluxing ocular inversion of the Necker cube should alert us already to the fhct that a complex psychic interpretation is taking place wherever we model a dimensional object. Does the object \"actually\" OCCUT in the manner of the schematic transparency by which we represent it to ourselves? Obviously the image is an effect of our perspectival orientation, and the \"angle\" by which we \"pick it up\" makes of the object a stylistic convention fiom the beginning. Haven't Picasso and Gris et al. modernly shown us the alternate potential of an object provisionally released fiom the constraint of focal perspective and allowed to present an arbitrary cross-section of planes, ktionated angles and multiple perspectives (showing clearly that a \"simple object\" such as block, pitcher or guitar has nofixedfom in Being whereby perspectival angle or orientation may be equated with truth, feality or reliable reification)? If for example a single face of the cube displays the figure of a clown, the perception of \"block\" itself will first of all be one of myriad disconnected forms, individuated objects conjured whole and complete through varying angles taken by the infant-psyche one isolated impression of which will be that of the clown. If the infant likes the image of the clown and \"wants it back\" even when the cube is turned in such a way as literally to make it a \"block\" to present perception of the desired image, a learning process must take place which-4x1 effect--efficiently eflaces the imme- diate presentation of the figure. Its innately ideoform character as an intelligible whole must be unfolded in its fuller implication."},{"pageNumber":1055,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Thus mechanical rotations performed arbitrarily on the object reveal their psychic character as an emergent equation is made through the graduated perspectives. The present (arbitrary) angle at which the impression is given finds itself in a psychic suspension, saturated with the abstract potential of various other angles; that potential, once disclosed, clings like an aura to the irnpressional object effectively negating its previous preemptive claim on the value of identity. The force of identity suddenly flows across the sensory impression and gathers to it, through the permitting mode of negation, the abstract potential produced in the presentation of all alternative angles in which the cube was modeled while retaining identifiably common traits. Memory And Imagination, Moderated By Will (The Play's The Thing) The retention and psychic \"matching\" ofthose unific or ideoform traits (i.e. color, shape, size, texture, odor, sensation) of course involves the process of memory. \"Memory\" however is not a new faculty arbitrarily rung in or introduced as an ad hoc means of assembling a larger picture. Memory is afunction of the primary, ideoform character of perception. The abstract unity through which any given phenomenon tends to be disclosed, is a value innately transcendent to the infinite possible subdivisions or alternative syntheses that might be made through the constitutive coordi- nates of the identified object. Such an organizational, abstract unity may therefore be transferred offany incidental object-impression that occasioned it, precisely because it is a transcendent value (i.e. it is never limited as one-to-one identity equation with any concrete phenomenon. Thus the phenomenon is wholly characterized by and appears as such an immediate, unitive abstraction; but such abstraction is never similarly reducible to exhaustive identity with any given phenomenon). This ability of abstract-unitive identities to exist in their own right, independent of the compound phenomena that may occasion them, translates functionally as a persistence. The persistence of an impression past its immediate, phenomenal disclosure is a function of its abstract unitive identity and takes the form of a general or categorical abstraction. It does not necessarily possess \"recollected features\" though such specifying forms and features may be abstractly evoked as well. In its basic value it abides as a persisting, undifferentiated potential having specijic identity independent of features but abstractly associated with \"defining characteristics\". In this way the variant phases of the block are \"memorized\"; the immediate perception of the block no longer gives the \"whole\" identity to that Psychic Presence through which it occurs, but becomes \"partial\" with respect to the memory-matrix in which it's now suspended. This has the return effect of \"finitizing\" the sense of identity belonging to percipient-consciousness (con- stantly taking its cues fkom the \"modeling\" of phenomenological disclosure). The psyche accepts a deepening sense that its immediacy through the phenomenal field is limited, functionally restricted and therefore not \"whole\". It attaches increasingly greater importance to the synthetic modeling of the \"block\" which takes place through the abstract identity-matrix of memory, for such compound reconstitution of the object as a fully conceptual entjw is made with respect to mechanical agency-\"grasping\", \"manipulation\" etc. performed by sensory-motor coordinates---the applied \"measurements\" of which efficiently introduce the value of negation (as limit, restriction and unfulfillment) in the first place. The perspectival perception of the block is implicitly enhanced by a general-nonspe- cific-image possessing all the potential observed through its mechanical rotations. Thus it is an"},{"pageNumber":1056,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"object in its own right\" (i-e. a thoroughly imaginary abstraction) existing through a 3-space of calculable relationships and anticipatoly behavior. The fact of its \"imaginary\" character doesn't deflate its predictability, but regularizes and enhances it--since imagination is first of all the constitution of a given, behavioral field through the defining tams ofperspective. Imagination is a natural corollary of the fact that every pheno- menological venue is ideoform from the beginning. Imagination is afunction of the coordinates through which the patterns of cognition are generated. \"Idea\" implies the abstractly rational, the coherent and uniform (even the \"idea\" of chaos is a rational, intelligible abstraction furnishing a coherent standard that may be uniformly applied to a class of phenomenon). Thus the synthetic unities of imagination made upon the immediate ideoform character of things present provisional \"versions\" or practical extensions, assumptions and implications re that ideal self-coherence and uniformity. The behavioral field discloses mechanically predictable and repeatable patterns. It reveals consistencies, selective traits or properties that persist. It is subject to a certain degree of functional certitude or confidence. The speciJic degree of this certitude or confidence is a product of actual \"rearing\" and has deep implication with respect to the given, resultant psychology, the fomtion of the \"personality\". This in turn has direct bearing on the central theme of this essay re the prospect of distinctly \"positive\" and \"negative\" beings. Babes Don't Live By Bred Alone From the viewpoint of \"scientifically acceptable\" evidence implicitly taken from the physical perspective, we may note that research identifies (out of the gnomonic or triple-striate, vertical structure of the brain) the basal lobes of the cerebellum as the systems emphasized in early learning associated with the coordination of complex movements. Deprivation of contact or of stimulating motion, caress or care at this critical stage is verifiably related to poor adaptation in terms of emotional or physical development. This in turn is direct testimony to the--quite human or nonclinical-fact that values involved in rocking, touch, nurture and so forth comprise for the embryonic psyche an indispensable envelope of love to replace the cushioning amnion; they're the means by which a necessary confidence is instilled (laying the ground-floor on which the psychic edifice is raised) in terms of adaptive orientation, relational security, inquisitive heartiness etc. There is then, in the earliest history of psychic development, an immediate interaction with respect to the emotional centers; their involvement is required even at those stages pragmati- cally identified with medullary and hindbrain operations. (Again we must identi@ the misleading linearity involved in developmental descriptions carried over, by such \"human potentials\" com- mentators as J. C. Pearce, from physically-fixated research kitchens [subsidized by grants from the consensus reality of Western culture]; the simplistic linear model adapts with corroborative ease to outdated spirirual principles and their descriptive implications similarly derived from the waning era of the patriarchate. The scientific evidence must here be corrected according to its own implications, in order to short circuit the otherwise self-perpetuating loop between secular and spiritual versions of the same patriarchal mold+f. What Is 77ze Mother Current? May '90 issue). Physically, the values of pleasure and well-being may be identified with the anterior hypothalamus, the septal centers of the \"emotional\" or limbic system etc. These key sites experimentally respond to the relative attention or deprivation accorded faculties of the \"lower\" or vital centers (i.e. the basal brain or medullary lobes correlated with abdominal plexi through the"},{"pageNumber":1057,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV extended spinal axis, in which are bioenergetically printed those vital patterns composing the psyche's inbuilt \"desire-tracks\", its drives toward exercising innate tendencies of order, perceptual and behavioral regulation). As would be expected, the development of \"hand-eye coordination\" isn't exclusively associated with subconscious centers and autonomic response patterns; research indicates that fkom the substantia nigra in the basal brain, the neurotransmitter dopamine stimulates the operation of the caudate nucleus beneath the cerebral folds of the forebrain which is likewise associated medically with coordination and the initiation of movement. Through evidence of this relationship the intimate connection between coordinate and emotional centers becomes more apparent, deeply significant to the cross-roads of development associated with early stages of nurture and weaning. Deprivation of doparnine (linked to fewer neurons in the substantia nip) is causally related to Parkinson's Syndrome; conversely, an excess of the same neurotransmitter is involved in schizophrenic symptoms. Schizophrenia bears the emotional symptomatology of fear and paranoia, anxiety, painful cognitions and contractile dissociated response-patterns. The common term \"dopamine\" shows the complex non-linear interaction and structural correlation of the systems. Similarly, the structure of the hypothdamus in the midbrain implies the importance of developmental experience with respect to significant patterns of behavior related to vital life and its regulatory balance. The hypothalamus performs a key adjustive function in supervising master- gland control or hormone production of the pituitary; it serves to regulate the processes of eating and drinking, wake and sleepin conjunction with the reticular formation of the hindbrain---tern- perature stabilization and myriad other metabolic requirements. The fact that the hypothalamus is neatly divided into pleasure-pain loci at its anterior and posterior lobes respectively, suggests the deep significance of early care with respect to positive or negative influence on general psychic organization, level of adjustment, integral harmony and creative enrichment. We'll see in later installments how the primary integral harmony and love-continuity of Being, optimally descriptive of the mindhody whole and its world-patterns, is incorporated in an inversion of values by those negative learning situations conducted through extremes of functional deprivation, uncompensated stress etc. An understanding of this persistent presence (if operatively perverse incorporation) of the Love-value in the network of psychic adaptations, leads directly to an understanding of the nature, significance and even purpose of the spiritually Negative Beings for the overall Logoic pattern. Imagine That: The Null-Category Comes Between US (Un frei And Sicherheit; Urngang And Seitenabweichung; Uberschau And Sicht; Ubersicht And Sinn; Uberflus And Sinnbild; Uberlegung And Sichtung) The primary \"selfhess\" (the whole-value presence of Identity) through which cognition experiences the life-pattern, is the basic unity-of-being applied toward and informing every phenomenon. The tendency-to-coherence of an impression reveals the psychic nature of existence. At the same time, the abstract character of that unific value (behaving as the variable focus of superposed coordinates) carries with it the significant potential of negation, as when an \"identity\" is cognitively secured and drawn forward by negating alternative identities that might be made--and which potentially reside--upon or across its characteristics."},{"pageNumber":1058,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV This same abstract-unitive selfhess of being may be applied to being; in this way awareness may be denied the initial intimacy of its phenomenal identifications. This is what happens when an experimental identity-equation with instrumental limits, imposes a functional negation between the facultative \"drive\" and its object The object is negated in the immediacy of its intimate identity (the proto-samadhi of infancy) and reconstituted as a concept possessing a certain \"prehen- sile ver~ati1ity'~-4.e. it can now be \"grasped\" according to attributes that aren't immediately apparent but which are confidently anticipated through mnemonic synthesis and imaginative projection. Thus the infant, looking for its vanished clown, can pick up the block and rotate it till the image delightfully reappears. \"Concept\" is a variable abstraction which always surpasses the discrete presentation of any given object, while incorporating the object ideally in a pattern of affective prehensions (i.e. instrumental relationships surcharged with the psychic value through which the object was appro- priated in the learning process). Therefore it depends on the function of memory and is inseparable fiom it. \"Memory\" is in turn the negation of the sheer phenomenology of the object, in favor of an imaginatively enriched phenomenology containing operative potential, i.e. all the possible positions, relations and behaviors clinging as an undifferentiated-abstract \"atmosphere\" according to the defining coordinates as psychically synthesized. The implicit versatility or elastic variability of the abstracted memory-pattern, indicates the inherent presence of the imaginary component; imagination represents experimental degrees of hdom within the terms of a defining (mnemonic) pattem, the ''limits\" of the particular abstraction. The appearance of concept and memory therefore \"permit\" and underlie the appearance of language, i.e. the representative abstract of consensual communication. At the same time, our understanding of language in terms of the memory-function (i-e. as a conceptual abstraction surcharged with the imagimy variable) helps us identify the reason why researchers into braidmind behavior find that memory and language are organized through meaning rather than as a mechanical operation of syntax and word order. This spiritual description or \"phenomenological metaphysic\" given here, also supplies the ontological foundation for understanding why researchers have similarly discovered that learning isn't a matter of merely recording, as when it was supposed that a learned operation or response-pattern was coded as a simple, linear neurological track in specific labordifferentiated brain sites; that it is, rather, acts and their aims or outcomes which are represented in the \"motor cortex\", so that an adaptive variability of neurological patterning expressed through alternative movements and muscle-groups may be exhibited in the prospect of any particular action. \"Aims\" and \"outcomes\" are apprehensions, anticipatory values surcharged with intenf purpose and imagination-4.e. they are concepts imbued with meaning, volitional import and the abstract-operative potential distilled as memory. Thus the variable pattenzing of biochemical activity is a function of idea. Identification through the instruments of biomechanical patterning draws the value of negation forward, as the interpretive discrepancy between desire and its object. This intervening value of negation (upon which the temporally cancellating pattern of memory is abstractly stretched) diminishes immediate alignment of the force of identity with discrete phases of the perceived phenomenon; it suspends spontaneous identification through any present, constitutive (phenomenological) mode and defers"},{"pageNumber":1059,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV identification to the imaginary field in which the given object becomes embedded owing to the self-cancelling power of negation. It is through the value of the imaginary that the object is now given as bristling with prehensions, i.e. its variable positions, states and functions, potentialities, interpretive magnitudes and abstract indices of mekgs and intents. Placing this element of imagination between the \"sensory-motor\" and \"preoperational \" period, the value of a null category (a purely imaginary potential) presents itself; the null category secures the implication of that dawning internal division between the whole-value of Identity belonging to percipient-consciousness, and its constitutive phenomenology. The null category is a function of the instrumental discrepancy between the prehensive intents of Identity, and the identified object. Tbe null category acts thereafter as cancellingprefix to every phenomenal modeling of \"selfhood\". Such a categorical Negative treats the phenomenon in the manner of the self-referring statement, i.e. as a proposition of \"not-self '. Not-self is therefore an oxymoron, although it comes as a practical matter to characterize the variably shifting bound- ary-line of \"experience\". The status of \"not-self' appearing through the unitive ''selfhess\" or abstract identity of an object, imbues the phenomenal range with a dzrerential power. This differential power is in general what \"concept\" contributes to the process of ideoform cognitions, i.e. the value of \"selective preference\" whereby qualities are sorted after the fact according to interpretive qffinity. Thus human psychology with its inventory of attached (but detachable and interchange- able) traits is born. Owing to the null category which attaches--or potentially attaches--to object existence, the factor of awareness flowing over, around and beyond the constitutive objects of its field is differentiated by an absolute marginfiom those states; the transcendent aspect of awareness is left as an ambiguous indeterminacy, an empty presence. Yet it is clearly a constant term, a persisting and self-homogenous referent of the fluxing field of form. Its \"persistent indeterminacy\" seeks to defne its persistence as fixity, and its indeterminacy as the sovereign fluidity or \"freedom to determine\" belonging to the variable adaptive power of its instrumental prehensions (the body, with its volunmy functions and appendages). Its desire to secure its identity through the abstract va%ary of existence (in relation to \"not-self ' inventories in the phenomenal field) is then first of all en£lamed by the dzflerentiation that occurs through provjsional identity with instrumental limits. Seeking Transyl-dental Surfeit: Tepedly Biting Into The Heart Of Ego-Vladation, With A Seven-Fold Sanguine- Artery At Stake (Seibenhurgen, Or, Seibedgestirn) Differentiation is the principle of form; awareness necessarily seeks its own identity through form, since its desire takes its point of departure from the factor of differentiation. Thus it proposes to identify itself in the mode of object-existence, as a \"self' having the same values and properties as the delimited forms of \"not-self' in the phenomenal field. At the same time it exists as an abstract-indeterminate presence, and that value has to be calculated into the account. The \"transcendent\" component of whole-value awareness, then, becomes associatively identified with a nonspecific but finite, delimited-abstract \"self '. It becomes to itself an ideal object. It is the familiar \"I\" in the form of the ego, contrasted with the fluctuating field of \"not-I\". However, the persisting emptiness of this fmitized \"object\" is even more excruciating than the vague undiffer-"},{"pageNumber":1060,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV entiated emptiness of the subject-presence. Its sense of abstract self-containment creates a void, a hungry hole in Being that desires to be filled. The same term of negation that nullified the \"selfhess\" of the phenomenal field, interposes the reciprocally-invertible (or alternately cancelling) power of selection informing the enriched status of object-existence as mnemonic concept. Freed fiom rigid context in the perceptual field, such abstracted objects in the form of conceptualized memory-properties are accumulated over against the \"observational constant\"; they supply the potential traits that may be patterned as identity-constructs suitable to fill in qualifying predicates to that empty subject-\"self'. In the immediacy of their being all such memory-patterns serve as constitutive occasions of the \"selfhess\" of awareness, along with everything else; but by content they enlist the null category to deflect the value of identity toward selfdivision. In this way the empty \"I\" differentially draws to itself, as terms of psychological preference, a formal profile of provisional characteristics or ideal attributes: \"I am.... what?\" (i.e. \"I am... firechief, hungry, running, a shortorder chef, unappreciated, a civil servant\" etc.). Even the most rudimentary and thus object-specific of such identifications, i.e. that of the equation with the \"body\" and physical existence, is self-evidently psychic in nature when considering the metaphori- cal use to which every objective property may be put without explanatory preface; \"sourness\" for example is not just an experienced sensory quality without being at the same time a value capable of characterizing a whole range of strictly psychic unities such as events (\"the meeting went sour\"), personalities (\"'he had a sour disposition\") or states (\"it had a repellently sour atmosphere\"). Thus even though such qualities may serve secondarily as predicate characterizations (i.e. \"I am... the body\") that very service identifies them first asficnctions of consciousness (i.e. the \"self-being of existence is... incompressible, consolidated, a value of density\" etc.). As primary functions of consciousness, their phenomenological qualities occasion the presence-to-itself of awareness; every apperception no matter how ''unique'' is a self-modeling mode of the common Referent. The latter value is practically lost however through deep linear divisions of enculturation leaning heavily toward the \"patriarchal\" left-brain, and academically sanctioned (in knee-jerk fashion) through clinical descriptions of the learning process which tacitly favor and reiteratively coax out the \"materialization\" of the body-world as the \"real\" fiamework of the ghostly-internal subject (i-e. through such \"observations\" re the stage of ambiguity during transitions fiomprimary process to body-image or axial differentiation in which there's \"still a confusion between lingering elements of a 'material' self, and a world yet inspirited with 'psyche' and 'intents\"' etc.). Thus the strict analytic division between the ghost-image of the \"subject-self' and the assuring physical neutrality or \"indifferent materiality\" of the world is merely one experimental way of \"resolving\" the innate coinherence and identity between phenomenological disclosure, and the ''selfhess\" of awareness which informs it and to which such disclosure refers. Yet it is a \"way\" that necessa&ly carries forward and sanctifies certain unresolved tensions. The differentiated \"self' takes to itself a quasi-objectivity through its inventory of identity-predicates; its abstract indeterminacy as the value of awareness is conserved, through the emptiness haunting every dry-ideal category. The impossible \"perfection\" of the category (banker, worthless, beloved, just, villainous) lies precisely in that provisional investment of the whole of identity in a delimited abstraction, a thetic model. The abstractness of the categorical model and the wholeness of the identity invested in it, chafe against the defining limitation of the term. Nothing ultimately fulfills it. All its \"objective attributes\" may be obtained in experience-i.e. an \"actor\""},{"pageNumber":1061,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV may get his Academy Awards and every role he ever wanted, as well as all the public praise possible, and still there is no equivalency at all between the whole value of identity infusing the empty category of selfdescription, and the \"things\" that would purport to prove or flesh out the abstraction. The abstraction remains empty; no \"thing\" Mils if. There's ultimately only an ongoing testimony to the innate shortcomings involved in instrumental identity-equations authorizing technical (or object-specific) fulfillments. Such testimony is the condition of the ego, thoroughly characterizing the psychological profile first formulated in the \"masked\" condition of 3rd density existence. Since it's the \"otherness\" of existence (the ambiguous null category illusorily everting self-reference as the ccnot-self 7 which steals away the definitive victory ideally residing in the absolute coincidence between the \"self' of awareness and its empty object-category, it isfiom the field of \"other\" that the ego-self seeks to secure the verifying denouement. It requires that \"otherness\" in its responsive, self-conscious form (the object-correlative of the responsive selfcon- scious being of the ego self) to furnish the \"final\" validation or closing correspondence that constitutionally slipsfiom the self as the \"otherness\" of being. The \"seeking of parental approval\" for example, is one common or easily-identifiable instance of the more general project of validation, which is the real basis of ego-psychology (rather than the \"id\" or \"superego\", the will-to-power, etc.). \"Validation\" is the more accurate and complete characterization of the ego-project, since the ego doesn't always need or look for \"approval\"; indeed the disapprobation of \"sigtuficant others\" may be what it \"requires\" for its specific psychic structure, as objective cordhation or validation that (for example) its \"worthlessness\" thoroughly and infinitely characterizes it."},{"pageNumber":1062,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV Why ONE'S Awakening Tends To Be Rude (Though There's No Need, To Tselem On The Beauty Of It) From the manifest continuity and phenomenal coinherence characteristic of self-con- scious being in 4th density (the primary point of departure of the ego-soul in the previous Logoic pattern), awareness \"falls\" into or wakes up as the progressively polarized and dichotomously insulated ego-psyche of 3rd density--the point-of-departure for the present Logoic pattern. Identi- fication through instrumental limits (and the pain or disturbance associated with discrepancies that appear in the sense of \"self' outlined along the contours of those limits) furnishes the efficient means by which the nucleated ego-image becomes the characteristic fixture of 3rd density. The functional depth or mnemonic enrichment that has to take place in order to provide object-existence its operative compensations (i.e. the bare percept of \"plate\" as a joyful sufficiency- of-being, progressively dissolved before the prehensility that draws its contents closer to the mouth), at the same time serves to intensify the divisive impression forming around the \"tenses\". The temporalized \"alloy\" of the learning pattern abstracts the value of memory as a separately honored agent. It becomes the operative basis of the \"independent\" ego-self (i.e. that persisting self-image or identity-abstraction that can be detached fiom the immediacy of its instrumental prehensions and their objects so as to provisionally ovemde, by an imaginative or synthetic continuity, the \"break\" in being manifested through that operative polarity). This has medical parallel in the idea that the hippocampus of the limbic system linked to formation of long-term memory-pattern is, like the amygdala, identified as a site through which values of pain and deprivation are processed. Thus there appears a \"tear\" in Being along a dotted line of intermittent discontinuity and discomfort. That tear shows ragged ridges between the forms of instrumental identity, and their conformable objects. The accent of this tear with its mismatched edges, serves to reinforce and deeply secure the differential commitment of whole-value identity; its unity is dedicated to a divisive contour. In this way the required factor of Adversity is installed as a key feature of 3rd density. Thus 3rd-density is justified as an addition to the levels of the \"previous\" Logoic pattem; its \"masked\" or selectively filtered, reduced-down character magnifies the values of \"~ction\" and \"tension\" to a catalytic degree. Self-awareness is necessarily intensified along a particular line; significantly less in the way of instrumental parallelisms with the \"wholeness\" and \"continuity\" of Being may be taken for granted. Awareness ispractically amplified along the self-conscious contour of a basically fictive magnitude, i.e. ego-being. We have seen how the value of the \"imagii\" is a basic component of the instrumental pattern, so that the \"fictive\" character of ego isn't in itselfa demerit. \"Ego\" operates as an expedient; through the extreme polarization and differential contrast created across the masked landscapes of 3rd density, the factor of ego operates a very intensified value of self-consciousness. The acuteness of the divisions and discrepancies that accompany vital weaning in the learning stages of functional attachment, arouse a sharply defined self-sense awakening to a type of existential concern. The magnified modes of \"survivalism\", the \"reproductive\" stress that underscores existence through a medium screened fiom automatic caretakership, produce an aggravated self-sense of highly individual \"inquisitiveness\"; the early compulsions to \"survive\""},{"pageNumber":1063,"pageContent":"furnish the momentum for an awakening intelligence or self-conscious acuity that flows around and beyond those first concerns on its innately transcendental stream, moving always toward forms of awareness (only fully polarized in an environment screened fiom direct/instnunental continuities with whole-being value) that optimize the fact of self-consciousness in itself, inquiring directly into the very nature and destiny of everything altogether. This intensification of \"Self '-inquiry to a potentially transcendent degree on the basis of sufficient initial momentum, is-* we've seenltot a marked characteristic of gratis birth through an unmasked sphere instrumentally optimized in congruence with whole-being unity and (int'imately interconnected) void-permeability. Motto Limned In Invisible Lemon On The Lintel Over The Door Of Third Density: Death Is Just Nature's Way Of Saying \"Keep Moving\" Understood in this way, \"ego\" (even the acute ego-form characteristic of 3rd density) isn't basically an improper or delusionary mode predicating \"status\", judgmental contrast or categories of inferior/superior. \"Ego\", understood in context, is an organizationalfunction. It's the expedient self-refereat of instrumental order. It's the efficient, thematic catalyst for formulating the coordinate harmonies of the mind/body whole in the context of 3rd stage stylization; it gives the psychic values of those instrumental limits polarized into extreme, \"3-d\" relief. Its ccshortcomings\" in tans of the grossly-physical functions with which it's identified, serve to \"keep the edge\" on being so that a relaxation of aggravated Inquiry into existence can't be long sustained. For 3rd-stage existence, the efficient terminus of identity in close congruence with functional limit makes all \"projection\" or imaginary prospect beyond such limit an opaque door, uniquely introducing a style of blunt ''termination\" collectively revered as Death. Ultimately then, as the psychic implication of such \"limit\", it is death which gives the ego its defining tension; it is death which maintains the restless stimulation to self-inquixy, and keeps up the pressure at the provisional \"boundaries\" of consciousness. Ego operates as an organizational function, then, within the context of extreme polari- zation and a conceived antinomy of countercharged values. Thus in mediating the order and coordinate harmony of its multidimensional pattern, the expedient self-reference of ego represents a peculiar challenge; its singular work is that of formulating the implications of separatism, self-insularity and acute opposition on the ground of an encompassing holism and integral unity- of-being . The only real question arises, then, as to how that formula is to be drawn up in every given case; will the implication in the face-off of those values promote service toward the smooth integration of a socially harmonious whole (the given unity of a \"group\" composed of such diversified and contrastive cells), emphasizing traits of cooperation and forbearance, justice, equity and balance? or will it suggest values of \"social\" order, regulation and control based on the furtive privatism available to such a-literalized-quantum of isolation as the self-encoiled ego wherein the inflations of subjectivity grow sovereign in their solipsism, and harmony is defined by the degree to which the field of \"other\" can be coerced into definitive subjugation to the deified self? Over many turns of the wheel, the ego-soul strategically focused in 3rd-density Me- work is furnished the pressure-cooker conditions in which the faculties may be used on a creative"},{"pageNumber":1064,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV thrust aimed at pushing back just the existential barriers of limit formulated by those faculties, in their restrictive identification. The limits of its instrumental identities become virtues to the ego-faculty, as it's drawn along the haunting cwe of the questionmark-of-Being toward deeper forms of perception, functional integration and coordinate harmony. Existing on and through the very ground of the indivisible Whole, the ego is nonetheless operatively screened from direct cognition of such unity; from the fact of this primcny intemal division or apparent \"antinomy\" appearing across the holism and continuity of being, the ego works through all the tensions and motivating ambiguities embedded in the apparent \"opposition\" of integral complements. For 3rd-stage ego, the creative coinherence of such polarized complementaries appears as incessant alternation through obligatory forms of one-at-a-time identity and delimiting focus. The psyche of 3rddensity continuously rotates on the counterchanges of those complementary charges, securing deeper integrities and finer forms of coherence through the available method of applying that (implicit and informing) unity-of-being toward the synthesis of contrastive tenns. To the dichotomized 3rd-stage ego, the underlying unity-of-being takes the form of synthesis; thus the innate presence of creativity, internally pushing the 3rd-stage psyche to higher modes of self-comprehension, exhibits a characteristically dialectic profile. ww 6 by Hidc Trumpel HAL 0.

By virtue of the spiraling, creative dia- lectic of 3rd density awareness the indivisible unity-of-being is approached and progressively approximated as an asymptote; all of this is simply due to the fact that the point-ofdeparture of the ego-psyche at this stage, is an instrumentally pre- sumed dualism. Through this filtrate, highly styl- ized mode, the multidimensional mind-body pattern takes on very defined and specialized forms of integration. By permission of a variable ratio of harmony and interaction amongst mind-body ten- ters and their current processes, the psyche at this level accomplishes unique blends of creative in- strumentality. The fine eye of a painter, the trig- ger-reflexes of an athlete, the deep-emotional chords of a musician all serve over the course of the Wheel's turning to \"tighten the focus\", en- hance the awareness (through the preliminary practice of \"specialized interest\") and--bevita- bly--to draw the spark of self-conscious kindling along the updraft of its creative aspirations toward the common point where all considerations meet: on the very, Interrogative ground of that con- sciousness itself. For finally (and at last, ideally) all the magic and cumulative accomplishment in the creative intensification or integral upgrading of"},{"pageNumber":1065,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV the ego pattern in 3rd-density context, betrays the emptiness or \"non-finality\" of its self-defining object The most celestial rendering of the Gates of Heaven by the greatest artist imaginable, has only succeeded in producing the provocative outline of a potential; it has given the Soul another unfulfilled image of itself, so that all the ratification or reward that might devolve upon the subject as artist has, in the meantime, been undercut and brought to nothing in advance through the revelatory inroads made along creative lines-of-inquiry in the very content of his work. The content precipitated by creative self-investigation of the psyche ultimately shows up the emptiness of the form through which it was pursued, i.e. the object of ego-validation. Ego Intent, And Spiritual Intent: Meeting The Soul's In-tent Revival With A Four-square Samekh From such an ideal point foxward, the ego-self is naturally confronted with the prospect of placing the balance of the Being along another axis altogether; implicitly, then, it confronts the prospect of transference to another stage of consciousness (such a stage necessarily corresponding to another and higher density of existence). It becomes self-evident that no further advance along the dialectic continuum of creative inquiry in the standard ego-context will serve. Some value of real discontinuity suggests itself. The ego-soul stands implicitly at the crossroads juncture present- ing a higher-order antinomy4.e. the dawning alternative between fundamental modes of being based either on the value of Ego-intent, or the informing ideal of Spirirual intent. This alternative involves a tacit substitution of aims, having real revolutionary implica- tion For all ego-aims (including conventional \"religious\" motives that serve the same formula) share a common element that identifies them uniformly as belonging to one, invariant project: regardless whether the \"ego\" seeks the identity of saint or sinner, beloved or despised, billionaire or pauper, the underlying intent of all ego-activated \"doing\" is that of validation. The ego intends, through whatever \"medium\" or incidental ideal, to resolve into definitive coincidence with itself, so that it is in effect self-substantiated. The unsupported emptiness of the ego-being proposes to receive the infinite support of its own personally-valued terms, regardless the obvious contingency and conditionality of any such term. In order for such definitive resolution of the being to be made, the polar terms of the ego necessitating such \"resolution\" in the first place must be aligned like mutually reflective mirrors. It is the (internally subdividing) polarization process belonging to the self-reflective faculty of egoconsciousness, which has produced the disparate tenns of the equation in the first place, i.e. \"self' and \"other\"; thus the resolution of \"perfect coincidence\" and self-consistency-of-being implicitly proposed through the ego-project, requires the smoothly reflec- tive conformance of the rehctory value of \"other\" to an infinite degree. A 3rd-stage psyche of a given threshold value of creative integration is sufficiently \"unified\" around a particular quality, no matter how conditional in itself, as to be able to identify the deep futility of the ego proposition. There is no denouement to the project of ego-intent. Let's say, for example, that aphilosopher such as \"J. Paul Same\" illustrates the integral achievement of this threshold potential for insight; thus he's able to make the declaration re the \"utter futility of the 'human project\"', having in this case however confused a psychological pronouncement for an ontological impasse. His \"ontological\" description is in fact no such thing; he's very studiously outlined a closely observed dialectic of ego-psjxhology, so that his celebrated"},{"pageNumber":1066,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV \"pessimistic\" conclusions are pessimistic on behalf of the ego only! (thus far...but as yet no farther, for the French team). The rising standard of Spiritual intent, however, presents another prospect altogether. Wherever the juncture is met at which this standad presents itself as an authentic alternative, the soul may truly place itself at the disposal of a completely different Principle. TrZillSfening to the basis of authentic Spiritual-intent, the ego doesn't evaporate, burn up in the Spiritual Sun or fade like a mirage. Rather, the ego procedurally places itself upon another Footing, where, by virtue of the integral hannony and functionally unified value-of-being already achieved at a threshold level, it renounces the Wity of \"self-substantiation\" in favor of the magnified apparency of Whole-being Value in fact informing the patterns through which the \"ego\" is reflected. It orients itself according to a completely different set of considerations. Under aegis of Spiritual intent, the aim of \"ego\" (as organizational function) is that of aligning all forces, faculties, instruments and acts in congruence with Unitive Void-Being, so as to senre unlimited awakening into Identity with that Value. Correctly grasped, \"spiritual\" intent is not just another subhead in the cataloguing of ego-intent. Spiritual intent is a distinctly different subject. There is only ego-intent, or Spiritual intent. Spiritual intent in its viable form doesn't belong to the same plane of values as, for example, the idea of \"God\" which Castaneda's Don Juan correctly proclaimed to be just another item on the table of the \"tonal's\" inventory, along with the napkins and fork. Spiritual value is the only category which can be itemized along with the others and yet not belong in the same group. As an \"aim\" or \"object\", Spiritual intent is ultimately the only proposition that serves to belie the delimiting objectivity embodied in the very notion of \"goal\". For it is spiritual intent alone, understood correctly only at the moment of soul-ripeness, which represents the revolutiomuy prospect of placing the \"ego\" upon an entirely different basis, orienting its function about a Principle which to be realized charges exactly the ego's coinage for the service, turning its contour inside-out so as to empty it of both its ordinary principle, and its usual \"interest\". The intent of \"Spirituality\" can do this because, although it appears as a subject amongst subjects, it's the only one which when realized is inclusive of while surpassing them all, \"spiritu- ality\" is a matter fiom which nothing is ultimately excluded, not physiology or philosophy, law or medicine, life or death. It isn't another item amongst them, but the Common Denominator into which they all go evenly in the end. Thus the realized value of Spirituality is, uniquely, the ground of resolution where all problematic postulates come to heel (i.e. \"heal\"). Hangin' In There, Man...How Ego Rides The Bucking Brahma Verily Where Its At, Man As might be expected of so long-suffering a postulate, the standard orientation of ego doesn't give up the ghost as soon as attention authentically turns toward the prospect of SpiriruaI intent (however that is practically conceived in any given case). With a fateful resolve the ego makes its leap, entering a twilight path the destiny of which winds over the Midnight horizon across a shadow territory, wholly unlike the well-lit roads of the ego's own passage. To endure the innate uncertainty ofthe situation, ego draws on the threadbare comfort ofthe \"familiar\". There is therefore a great deal of actual overlap in making the Transition. In practice there is no clean break between orientations. The features of ego-intent persist well into progressively unfamiliar territory; what's"},{"pageNumber":1067,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV in fact discovered is that the very ground of spiritual value may be reached, the environment supportive of a whole new orientation claimed ... and \"ego\" in its persisting, non-transformed patterns may still be much in evidence! This indeed is a fact of \"spiritual practice\" which isn't so well known as it ought to be. Why is that? Let's review our definition of \"ego\". We've seen that it isn't a status but an organizational function. As such a function, ego isn't an \"entity\" or definable center located in a particular lobe or organ. 3rd density ego is a cultured configuration of systems and centers; to hold it in place as an artifice of \"reflective triangulation\", a specific range in the ratios and defining harmonies of the mind-body systems is secured by coordinate \"lockin\" (i.e. the fixity of the kunddini-nucleus patterning the multidimensional interaction of current-processes). In order that it standpee above the threshold divide of Whole-being Awareness as a volitional preference, however, all that's required is (1) its conservation as a pattern of the \"soul-record\" (a given condition of the enduring medium of that record, requiring no special act or attention); and (2) the intentional commitment of Identity technically intensified to a formal parity with the integral void-continuity of Being-which in itself can simply be the mechanical consequence of mind-body realignment in orientation toward spiritual values. If, in reading the above, the reader infers fiom this that \"ego\" doesn't automatically vanish as viable candidate for identity-investment after the \"fixed\" stage is surpassed at which it's technically coded, the reader has read correctly. If the reader also recognizes that this contradicts conventional wisdom re the automatic dethronement of \"ego\" as central value upon achieving the unmasked stage where its illusory character is exposed, the reader has followed with high \"com- prehension\" marks on his spiritual SAT scores (\"Sat\" as in the Sanskrit Being rather than \"Scholastic Aptitude Test\", you know). This should help account for the curious fact that there can be negative \"spiritual\" beings (in the case of such beings there is no true transference in orientation to \"Spiritual intent\"; nonetheless magnitudes of \"spiritualized\" void-value are technical& available to the mindlbody system of sufficient threshold harmony, regardless the continuity of its orienta- tion--simply as a function of the ''k variable\"); similarly, it can help explain the demonstrable (but conventionally \"unallowable\") fact that those technically polarized to the Positive-& orientation toward the value of Spiritual Intent-may seem quite able to \"hang on\" to the formally antiquated ego identity as a quixotic after-image, a furtive but sometimes-visible holdover. How can this be? If we've seen thus far that \"ego\" is ht-of-all an organizational function, it must be tacitly recognized that its existence is more formidable than that of a mere excrescence, i.e. something dispensable once its \"fallacy\" is identified. The prominent, high-profile identity function of 3rddensity ego, once permitted in the \"revised articles\" of the Logoic constitution makes a legitimate entry into the sum of real constituents that, due to their very existence through the validating force of Spirit-being must thereafter be taken into account, can't be arbitrarily expunged--and about which something must ultimately be done. If for example ego should find itself \"displaced\" (i.e. shifted to a cognitive context in which its authenticity as central referent of experience is critically challenged), it still persists as an impression imbued with the Legitimacy of its basicfunction. It will not disappear. It doesn't just \"dissolve in the face of God\". It doesn't \"get lost\" (how many times have we heard someone proclaim \"I've lost the ego\"!) Rather it displays an operative continuity, without however being automatically aligned with a proper object, Its relative orientation to the Value (i.e. \"Spiritual intent\") commensurate with"},{"pageNumber":1068,"pageContent":"MATRIX IV that Ground, depends on the practice by which it was brought there. In any case, there is nothing automatic about its fit integration to that Value. The intensif;cation of mvareness naturally accom- panying the meed context, flows through everything alike including the ego-function. The requirement remains; something musf be done with that function, under conditions of that intensi- fication. Otherwise it could just as easily assume such ''suffusion\" as mandate for its own Expansionism according to persistent habit, the Way seemingly cleared through loss of its \"opaque\" quality in the rebalanced context. All of this, if there is failure to recognize \"ego\" as a volitional consequence. Traditional interpretation ends discussion of \"ego\" with its identification as an illusion. Like a mirage then, it should disappear upon approach. It's for this reason that initiated \"dissatis- faction\" must be expressed toward the traditional account of \"ego\". Ego doesn't quaver on the air like a passively-received impression, an hallucinatory image. \"Ego\" is the specific organizational function that accounts for the disposition of will in 3rd-density context. What's established by will, must be resolved through will. Therefore the dqosition of \"ego\" is never automatic. \"Ego\" must do work, in order to be integrated satisfactorily into any context according to intent. Therefore it must do work if it would be compatible with the Whole-being Value to which it's been introduced. It must engage a proper volitional mode so as to reorient its function about another principle, if it would phase into congruence and harmony-of-identity with the Value that subtends it. The work it must do, is always categorically the same. It must work on behalf of the Whole. It cannot just \"proclaim\" it It must do it The \"ego\" is the Doer.
