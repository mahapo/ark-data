We’ve had regular comments to the effect that every is - sue is better than the last, which is really grat - ifying (although a little daunting to keep up with expectation!). This issue we seem to have developed a theme about contact with ‘non-human intelli - gences’. We’ve got got an exclusive interview with one of the best scientists investigating fringe topics, Dr Jacques Vallee. We profile cryptozoologist Loren Coleman, and also have an article from Colm Kelleher and George Knapp on the infamous ‘Skinwalker Ranch’ in Utah. On top of all that, we also have an in - sightful piece from Margaret Starbird on Mary Magdalene – Margaret’s work has reached a new audience lately after her books were en - dorsed in Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code. A growing number of advertisers have been contacting us, and so you’ll notice a fair amount of ads in this issue.

R e searchers have found evidence that meditation can alter the physical struc - ture of our brains. Brain scans of study participants revealed that experienced meditators had an increased thickness in parts of the brain dealing with at - tention and processing sensory input. Surpris - ingly, the brain increase is more pronounced in older rather than younger people. “Our data suggest that meditation prac - tice can promote cortical plasticity in adults in areas important for cognitive and emotional processing and well-being,” says Sara Lazar, leader of the study and a Harvard Medical School psychologist. “These findings are con - sistent with other studies that demonstrated increased thickness of music areas in the brains of musicians, and visual and motor areas in the brains of jugglers. In other words, the struc - ture of an adult brain can change in response to repeated practice.” The increased thickness of grey matter was found to be 4 to 8 thousandths of an inch, which is not particularly much. “These increas - es are proportional to the time a person has been meditating during their lives,” Lazar notes. “This suggests that the thickness differences are acquired through extensive practice and not simply due to differences between meditators and non-meditators.” Buddhist ‘insight meditation’ was used, rath - er than traditional ‘om’ mantra chanting. Par - ticipants were a mix of amateurs and others who had been meditating for decades. They all meditated an average of about 40 minutes each day. Measuring the slowing of breathing rates determined how deeply the participant was meditating. It was found that the deeper Study suggests meditation increases brain size The Benefits of Meditation the meditation, the greater the changes in brain structure. “People who [practice ‘insight meditation’] quickly realise that much of what goes on in their heads involves random thoughts that of - ten have little substance,” Lazar said. “The goal is not so much to ‘empty’ your head, but to not get caught up in random thoughts that pop into consciousness.” Lazar is cautious when asked whether medi - tation may help slow aging. “Meditation may help slow some aspects of cognitive aging . . . but it’s important to remember that monks and yogis suffer from the same ailments as the rest of us. They get old and die, too. However, they do claim to enjoy an increased capacity for at - tention and memory.” E g yptology is stunned by the announcement of the first tomb to be unearthed in Egypt’s Valley of the Kings since Tutankhamun’s in 1922. Estimated to be about 3000 years old, the tomb is not that of a pharaoh’s, but could be for members of a royal court. Inside the undecorated single-chamber tomb are five wooden sarcophagi with painted funeral masks, sur - rounded by 20 alabaster storage jars with Pharaonic seals. “It could be the gardener,” joked Otto Schaden, head of the U.S. team who excavated the tomb. “But it’s somebody who had the favour of the king be - cause not everybody could come and make their tomb in the Valley of the Kings.” Controversy surrounds the discovery of the tomb.

The government has been fighting since 1999 to ban the practice, but the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the New Mexico church can legally import and use ayahuasca for religious rites until a final hearing is held. It is the first religious freedom decision under Chief Justice John Roberts, who quickly decided the government should stay out of a church’s religious practice. Roberts wrote that federal drug agents should not have been al - lowed to confiscate the church’s ayahuasca tea. Roberts was skep - tical of the government’s zero tol - erance position and believed they were demanding too much. Roberts highlighted that fed - eral law allows the use of peyote by the Native American Church. “If such use is permitted...for hundreds of thousands of Native Americans practicing their faith,” Roberts wrote, “it is difficult to see how those same findings alone can preclude any consideration of a similar exception for the 130 or so American members of the UDV who want to practice theirs.” “This is not a case where reli - gious groups are asking for immu - nity from public laws, but merely for an important check on the gov - ernment’s ability to interfere with religious practices,” said Melissa Rogers, visiting professor of re - ligion and public policy at Wake Forest University Divinity School. UDV is a mix of Christianity and indigenous Amazonian sha - manic beliefs, specifically the con - sumption of ayahuasca. According to the UDV’s website, use of aya - huasca is limited to ceremonies, and abuse of the drug is consid - ered sacrilegious. In the United States, there are about 140 UDV members.

Dr Jacques Vallee has long held a reputation as one of the most stringent researchers in ufology, and over the course of four decades he has contrib - uted probably more than any other researcher to our understanding (if you can call it that) of the UFO phenomenon. Also, the more recent investigation into the ‘Skin - walker Ranch’ in Utah by the National Institute of Discovery Science confronted many of the same problems that Dr Vallee has dealt with in his research, most notably the difficulty in studying a phenomenon which seems able to interact, predict, and ‘trick’ those who attempt to observe it. Both of these features re - inforce the difficulty of study - ing anomalous experiences – from UFO sightings through to paranormal events and mysti - cal experiences. By modern standards, the only way of ‘proving’ such occurrences is through employing the ‘scientific method’, displaying re - peatability and significant results. However, that method has been developed, by and large, as a way of studying the physical world. If we are dealing with an outside ‘intelligence’ in any of these experiences, capable of interacting with the experimenter or manipulating their results, things are not so simple. In his book Messengers of Deception , Dr Columns GREG TAYLOR Columns GREG TAYLOR Vallee recounts that when discussing this problem with a military person, they suggest - ed that in the above situation one has moved beyond a situation conducive to scientific ex - perimentation, and one should contemplate employing intelligence-gathering. That is, if an intelligence is manipulating results, then the ex - perimenter needs to employ new methods to get around this problem. As interesting as this debate is, however, it doesn’t address a major problem – that of con - vincing others of the ‘reality’ (in the softest definition!) of the phenomenon. Even providing a substantial amount of indicative evidence – as parapsychological researchers have, from Dean Radin in The Conscious Uni - verse , to Jessica Utts’ statistical analysis of the Stargate remote- viewing program – has not been enough to persuade or - thodox scientists (and funders) that there is something here which challenges the modern scientific para - digm. Perhaps the key then, is to have as many of these people as possible actually experience ‘border’ phenomena. Benny Shanon, a cognitive psychologist who is recognised as one of the world’s authorities on the scientific investigation of the ayahuasca experience, points out that he feels it absolutely necessary that one must engage with the expe - rience, rather than study it ‘from the outside’ – as many scientists would have it: What was further clear was that one cannot study the ayahuasca experience without exten - sive first hand acquaintance with it. After all, it would be strange to study dreams without having dreamt oneself, or to investigate music without having listened to various kinds of music. That is not to say that Shanon disregards sci - entific analysis of the phenomenon. His work on evaluating the ‘universals’ behind the experi - ence has been groundbreaking, and he presents his scientific work within the necessary frame - work. However, at the same time Shanon feels that we should be willing to step beyond a cold analysis, and feel free to come to conclusions which may stretch into the metaphysical realms (albeit at the personal level): Objective scientific analysis is indispensable for the gaining of further understanding of the non-standard cognitive phenomena ayahuasca presents. At the same time, however, to have had ayahuasca and remain the Western European that one had been beforehand amounts to hav - ing missed some of the most essential and most precious things that the ayahuasca experience can offer. With this, however, one finds oneself outside the domain of cognitive psychology. One is led to the province of philosophical reflection and metaphysical speculation as well as to realms which are very personal and as such are beyond the context of public discourse. I have to admit though that I disagree with Shanon on whether the ‘philosophical’ side of the discussion is beyond the context of pub - lic discourse. No doubt, you won’t find it in a peer-reviewed science journal. But I also feel that the sharing of experiences, the place - ment of the phenomena within a historical framework, and speculation on possible ori - gins, may be a helpful way of advancing. If we lock our research within the modern scientific paradigm, then perhaps there is no way of un - derstanding these phenomena which by their very definition are outside the confines of our current knowledge.

To remove any confusion I should perhaps clarify that the ‘gnosis’ model (small g) I am talking about is not the same as original Gnosticism (capital G). This latter is based around the ideas found in the Nag Hammadi texts, which broadly speaking sug - gest that the physical plane is an abomination conjured up by one or more fallen angels who challenged God’s supremacy, and that it is our job to release ourselves from its illusions by achiev - ing Gnosis. By contrast, many modern gnostics seem to think that experience of all realms, both physical and nonphysical, is illusory. For them, gnosis in - volves recognising that we are part of the Ultimate Unity and discarding the illusion of indi - viduality, which should allow us to escape the illusion completely and reu - nite with the Source. This modern gnosis model seems to be increasing in popularity. And whether or not its various adherents accept the evidence for individual soul reincarnation seems to hardly matter, because for all this will still only be a diversion at best, or a complete illusion at worst. I have now discussed these matters with a variety of gnostics, and while some seem quite comfortable with considering Columns IAN LAWTON IAN LAWTON themselves superior to any sources of ethe - real wisdom who are still labouring under the illusion of individuality, others become some - what uncomfortable when confronted with this inherent assumption in their worldview. The sources of ethereal wisdom to whom I predominantly refer are those encountered during interlife regression. My take on these sources is that they regularly display such profound wisdom that to classify them as la - bouring under delusions, or as being part of some horrible conspiracy – ei - ther of which any true gnos - tic on the earth plane can see right through – smacks of no little arrogance. I have also shown repeatedly that we have every reason to assume that the evidence of what are now thousands of inter - life regression subjects can - not be blithely written off in total as deriving purely from subjective imagination. But not only that, I have yet to find any gnostic who can provide a proper answer as to why their worldview makes any rational sense when considered from the broadest of perspectives. I and many others maintain that the Source manifests the entire universe, in all its nonphysical and physical forms, in order to experience. But I also maintain that the reason why so many spiritual worldviews are misguided is because they fail to appreciate the fundamental duality that lies at the heart of Rational Spirituality: that is, that we are part – indeed holograph - ic representations of – the Source, and indi - vidual souls on a reincarnatory journey, all at the same time . As such it is by and large our duty to do our bit for the process of gaining collective experience for the Source. And we clearly would not do this if we achieved gnosis at an early stage and were able to reunite with It straight away. Indeed, I have argued that the whole concept of reuniting with the Source is to some extent misplaced, since we always have been and always will be integral to It. Nevertheless, further consideration and discussion of these issues has led me to believe that there is an important additional implica - tion of the fundamental duality of our simul - taneous soul individuality and unity, to which I have not previously paid sufficient attention. Yes, from a reincarnatory perspective our pri - mary objective should be to learn how to bal - ance out a variety of experiences over many lifetimes. But we should also appreciate that recognition of our oneness with each other and everything else brings an important added perspective. How can we judge the plight or actions of others, or fight to gain material or political supremacy over them, when they are us and we are them? How can we threaten and wipe out other species, or decimate our rainforests, or wreak havoc on our planet’s delicate ecological and atmospheric systems, when all of these things too - whether ani - mate or supposedly inanimate - are us? Once we appreciate that everything is unity , it gives us a whole new and vital perspective. The beautifully symmetrical corollary to this from the individual soul perspective is that we should not engage in such activities because, in broad terms at least, we have all been in the situations that others face at some point in a past life – or if not we will be at some point in the future. Of course, the full achievement of such ideals in our daily lives is extraordinar - ily difficult if not impossible, and even our fail - ures add to our experience. But this does not lessen the importance of attempting to pursue them both individually and collectively.

Unlikely. In the letter he wrote on the day of his death, he described the pains that were racking his body. It was not that he was im - mune to pain, as he said, but that the memory of his blessings made his pain bearable, and even drowned them out from his awareness. “Every pain is easy to despise,” should not be taken too literally. As a doctrine to be memorized by the disciple, it had another job: to reinforce the rhetoric of the right attitude we should adopt. Every pain is easy to despise is a mantra to repeat, a goal or ideal posture to imagine, and its function is to help set the right attitude toward pain. Epicurus had poor health. As a consequence, he was proabably a close observer of his mind- body interactions. He probably noticed (as modern studies show) that the experience of pain is influenced by attitude, emotion, and at - tention – the “placebo effect” shows that belief and positive attititude work as well as drugs. Of all things, Bertrand Russell once noted, believing is the most characteristically mental . Belief is the least likely kind of thing we would ascribe to matter. We are not tempted to think that door knobs have bad attitudes or rain - drops believe in God. Nevertheless, mere be - liefs, in placebo experiments, produce benefi - cial psychophysical effects. Sometimes they can be startling. I’ll give you an example. Ipecac is an emet - ic that stops stomach contractions and causes nausea. However, when some Harvard experi - menters gave it to patients and told them it was a new anti-nausea medicine, the patients experi - enced relief. Belief in the power of the medicine was sufficient to reverse the physiological effect of a chemical agent. The medicine itself had no power, all of which lay in the belief. Epicurus would have been pleased; the Harvard experi - ment supports his confidence in our latent ca - pacity to “despise” pain. Suppose we grant that humans can reverse the normal effects of Ipecac. Does it stop there? What are the limits of human capacity? The truth is that we do not know and probably do not want to know. If we can disable chemical Michael Grosso is a teacher, author, and painter, whose interests span psychical research, metaphysical art, the parapsychology of religion, and, primarily, philosophy. He received his Ph.D. in philosophy, and studied clas - sical Greek, at Columbia University. He has published books on topics ranging from life after death to the mythologies of endtime. He presently lives in Charlottes - ville, Virginia, where he is affiliated with the Division of Personality Studies of UVA. Michael’s most re - cent book is titled Experiencing the Next World Now , which surveys the evidence for life after death and shows how personal experience can convince you it is real. A ccording to the Greek philosopher Epicurus, attitude is the key to happi - ness. The technical term is diathesis , “posture” or “disposition.” The philo - sophical art of happiness consisted of monitor - ing and rearranging one’s attitudes toward life. But what does that mean? And why attitude ? This is a curious word with a lively history. The original sense springs from the fine arts. In The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary under attitude we read: “the disposition of a figure in painting, statuary, etc.,” or, more gener - ally, “the posture of the body proper to or implying some ac - tion or mental state.” Attitude implies a disposition to think, feel, or act in a certain way. Life with attitude then is life lived resolutely, in a directed way, which is the sense of the word we will focus on. But to return to philosophy: the ancients recommended at - titudes that lead to a happy life. Attitudes express the whole person, so an at - titude is more than belief; it’s the disposition to act on belief. And more to the point: attitudes can be consciously reshaped, and must be, ac - cording to the old masters, if you hope for a flourishing life. Cities, nations, empires assume attitudes. America embodies its attitude in the symbol of the eagle, a bird of prey. Michelangelo’s David is a great artistic expression of attitude: a symbol of Florence, proudly posed – and poised – be - fore the world-Goliath. For the old Greek or Roman sage, attitude is something you cultivate, nurtured, and train. Attitudes can be personal; or have sweeping historic significance. Borrowing the atoms of Democritus, Epicurus formed a new attitude toward nature. Rejecting the prevailing belief that the violence of nature was caused by the gods, he gave naturalistic accounts of lightning, thunder, earthquake, plague, and other natural calamities. He expelled the gods from nature along with some unnecessary obstacles to the psychological peace of humanity. Earthquake, storm, plague and the rest, are not sent by gods we have of - fended; their occurrence is due solely to impersonal laws. This struck a new attitude toward nature, free from ter - ror and superstition. Unfortu - nately, even in 2005, after Hur - ricane Katrina, some Christian fanatics publicly proclaimed that God sent the monster storm to New Orleans to punish the in - habitants for their sins. Some Christians have yet to learn the more intelligent and humane attitude on this subject recom - mended by a pagan philosopher three hundred years before the birth of Christ. Other Epicurean precepts seem false or paradoxical, but less so when understood in relation to attitude.

It featured the Greek words To Mega Therion or ‘The Great Beast’, which was the name Crowley had adopted for himself. This convinced Leary of something that he had recently come to suspect; that he was a ‘continuation’ of Aleister Crowley and that his role in life was to continue Crowley’s ‘Great Work’, that of bringing about a fundamental shift in human consciousness.

Leary was the ex-Harvard professor who preached peace and love, adopted the mantra “tune in, turn on and drop out”, and led the exploding psychedelic movement. In the five years that followed he had been repeatedly arrested, imprisoned, had escaped from jail, been smuggled out of America by terrorists, was kidnapped by revolutionaries in North Africa, escaped again, fled to Switzerland, been jailed by the Swiss and was currently living a nomadic life moving between different Swiss Cantons under the protection of an exiled French arms dealer. Nixon had called him “the most dangerous man in America” and had sent John Mitchell, his Attorney General, to Switzerland to try and obtain his extradition. Leary’s life was playing out on such a grand, dangerous scale that it was tempting to believe that he had been somehow selected by the hand of history, and that great deeds were expected of him. His identification with Crowley began in earnest after Leary took an acid trip in the Sahara desert with an English beatnik artist and writer named Brian Barritt. Barritt was, in Leary’s words, “a fucking genius”. “Brian is an English Untouchable,” Leary wrote in 1971. “His shadow falling across the path of the middle class is enough to contaminate twenty lives. He is highly toxic. Brian is ancient but not old. He has put as many drugs as possible into his body for thirty six years and is obscenely healthy, diabolically wealthy, and looks about twenty. He intends to maintain this state for an indefinite period. He is not going to die; they will have to kill him.” Leary and Barritt first tripped together over the night of Easter Saturday and Sunday, 1971. The pair drove from the Algerian coast to a place called Bou Saada, on the edge of the Sahara. ‘Bou Saada’ means ‘City of Happiness’ and it was rumoured to be a very magical place. Leary had to collect some belongings from the Hotel Caid, where he and his wife Rosemary had previously stayed. These included the foreword that he had written for one of Barritt’s books, Brian Barritt, in 1974 (left) and 2001 (right)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"March 2006 | S ub Rosa 18 S ub Rosa | March 2006 19 and some of his wife’s clothes. It was the clothes that they were primarily interested in, for there were tabs of Orange Sunshine acid sewn into the hems, and some high quality Afghan hashish in the heels of the shoes. They ate the acid, and some hash, and drove out into the endless dunes until they found a dried up riverbed. Here they sat on the ever shifting, pepper-fine sand and watched the sun set while they waited for the LSD to hit. A full moon rose. Night fell on the desert. “The sky was on fire,” is how Barritt later described the trip that followed. “Massive galactic spaceships blinked into being, golden vessels with the faces of Egyptian Gods on their prows, gliding between life and death. [ . . . ] Beauteous cities glide by composed of materials not yet invented, towers twisted skywards. Through a window a woman with the face of an angel and the body of a spider was chatting me up with her eyes . . . ”. Leary, meanwhile, seemed to be performing some form of ceremony. He was pacing up and down reciting the alchemical phrase solve et coagula . Even by Leary and Barritt’s standards, it was a memorable night. But the trip included a few synchronicities that seemed to indicate that there was more to it than just a string of imaginative hallucinations. At the start of the trip Barritt became aware of a hooded man in the middle of a dust devil or a whirlwind of sand. He had a scroll or manuscript that seemed to be important, and which was linked to the Elizabethan magician and alchemist Dr. John Dee. Dr. Dee was one of the leading scholars of his day, and a man who played a leading role in the development of the science of navigation. He was also the court astrologer to Queen Elizabeth I, and he used her horoscope to choose the day of her coronation in 1558. He possessed what was believed to be the largest library in Britain, until the local townsfolk, believing him to be an evil sorcerer, burnt it down. He was also a spy for the Crown, and was sent on intelligence missions in various other European countries. It seems fitting, therefore, that he used to sign documents with the code ‘007’. Dee was also an alchemist and deeply involved in occult studies, even though these practices were extremely politically dangerous in the religious turmoil of the times. He became involved with the thief and grave-robber Edward Kelly, believing that Kelly had the ability to hear spirits and demons. Over many months Dee transcribed the information that was channelled ‘through’ Kelly, and the result was a body of magical work, including the language of the angels, that is known as Enochian Magic. A year after their trip at Bou Saada, Leary and Brian discovered that, in 1909, Aleister Crowley and the poet Victor Neuberg conducted a magical ceremony at that exact same riverbed in the dunes outside Bou Saada where they had taken LSD. Crowley and Neuberg summoned demons by invoking nineteen ‘calls’ that had originated with Doctor John Dee and Edward Kelly. Enochian magic was integral to Crowley’s magical system, and it was Dee and Kelly’s angelic script that Crowley was invoking at Bou Saada.

Mescaline was used, as was sexual magic, with Neuberg at one point buggering Crowley at an altar in a makeshift stone circle and dedicating the act to the god Pan. When the day came to invoke Choronzon, the demon of chaos and the abyss, Crowley did not remain outside the magic triangle. Instead he deliberately sat inside it. The pair would have made quite a sight as they performed their strange works amongst the shifting Saharan dunes. Crowley was dressed in a long black hooded robe with a revolver around his waist. Neuberg, with two tufts of dyed red hair twisted into horns, sat watching in a magic circle created for his own protection, and made notes. Crowley instructed Neuberg that, whatever happened, he must resist any attempt from the demon to be released. The invocation was completed, three pigeons were sacrificed and, according to Neuberg and Crowley’s accounts, Choronzon appeared. The demon possessed Crowley and began to taunt Neuberg, pleading to be released. They later claimed that Crowley/Choronzon began to change shape, appearing to Neuberg in a string of forms including an old lover and a snake with a human head. It begged the poet for a drink of water and promised that it would sit at his feet and obey him if it was freed. With Neuberg distracted by the dazzling images materialising before his eyes, the demon gradually dribbled the fine sand on the magic circle, slowly erasing it. Then the entity that possessed Crowley’s body rushed at Neuberg and, according to The Confessions of Aleister Crowley , “flung him to the earth and tried to tear out his throat with froth- covered fangs.” Fortunately, Neuberg had been armed with a consecrated magical dagger and managed to fend the beast off. Choronzon was banished, leaving Crowley lying naked in the sand. With the ceremony over, the magic circle and triangle were erased and a fire was lit to purify the place. Leary and Barritt were astounded when they discovered this, a year after their desert trip. That they had been at exactly the same riverbed was coincidence enough, but the cowled figure inside a dust devil that Barritt had ‘seen’ matched Crowley’s description of his possessed self. Crowley, who had been wearing a black hooded robe, described the demon possessing him as being a coagulation of forms that “swirl senselessly into haphazard heaps like dust devils”. The fact that he had been using a manuscript of the work of Dr. John Dee, which had also appeared to Barritt, pushed the incident way beyond coincidence. There were many similarities between Timothy Leary and Aleister Crowley, and this had not gone unnoticed at the time. Andy Warhol, for example, had commented on it. They had both come from repressive middle class backgrounds, and both rejected those values to found liberated and hedonistic religious sects. They both put great value on sex and drugs, and there are strong parallels between Leary’s Millbrook commune and Crowley’s Abbey of Thelema on Sicily. Crowley was dubbed the ‘wickedest man in the world’ during his lifetime, while Leary was called “the most dangerous man in America” by President Nixon. Crowley’s commandment ‘Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be The Whole Of The Law’ has similar libertine values to the commandments of the League of Spiritual Development, a “personal religion” of Leary’s invention, although Leary’s were softened to disallow controlling others. Both wrote re- interpretations of the Tao Te Ching . This is an indicator of the similar size of their egos, as the Tao Te Ching is arguably one of the most complete pieces of text ever written, and there are few who believe that they can improve on it. As Robert Anton Wilson demonstrated in Cosmic Trigger , there are many parallels between the “Starseed Features Features THE HIGH PRIEST AND THE GREAT BEAST THE HIGH PRIEST AND THE GREAT BEAST I Have America Surrounded Timothy Leary was a brilliant Harvard psychologist who was sacked from his research post because of his research into LSD and other psychedelic drugs. He went on to become the global figurehead of the 1960s drug culture, coined the phrase “tune in, turn on and drop out”, and persuaded millions of people to take drugs and explore alternative lifestyles. However, the impact of his work has been so controversial that it has completely overshadowed the man himself and the details of his life. Few people realise that Timothy Leary’s life is one of the greatest untold adventure stories of the twentieth century. He was jailed in California in 1970 and promptly escaped by shimmying along a telephone cable over the pris - on fence. He was kidnapped by armed revolutionaries and was rescued by terrorists. He was blackmailed by an exiled arms dealer and imprisoned on four continents. He betrayed the ‘drug culture’ by collaborating with the FBI, and he came close to murdering two US Government officers. He was chased around the world, from the Algerian Kasbah to European High Society, with the highest bail in human history on his head and the US Attorney Gen - eral snapping at his heals. Yet through - out his adventures his life remained a hedonistic blur of drugs and orgies, and his friends included John Len - non, Aldous Huxley, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. Timothy Leary led a life of unflagging optimism and reckless devotion to free - dom. It was, in the words of his goddaugh - ter Winona Ryder, ‘not just epic gran - deur but flat-out epic grandeur.’ This will be the first time that the full story of that life is told.

There are also parallels between the decline of each man’s life during their later years, and on the people, such as John Lennon, whom they have both influenced. They both had wives named Rosemary. Leary started to think of himself as a ‘continuation’ of Crowley, as opposed to a ‘reincarnation’ as it is normally understood. There were strong parallels between Dee and Kelly, Crowley and Neuberg, and Leary and Barritt, and Leary saw himself as part of a line of sorcerers that reoccurred throughout history. This was something that Crowley appeared to be aware of, although he believed that he was a reincarnation of Kelly, rather than Dee. (From what we know of Crowley, it is not surprising that he would wish to associate himself with the one considered to be the most evil!) Leary believed that he was playing out a ‘script’ for a regular transformative current that repeated itself throughout time. These ‘scripts’ existed in a similar manner to a song. A song only exists in time, not space, but it still exists enough for patterns, harmony and meaning to be detectable. Indeed, ‘time’ was the key here, or rather the change in the qualities of time that could be detected under LSD. There were moments during a trip, Leary believed, that his awareness outgrew the normal, unstopping, linear flow of time. After all, just as a two- dimensional drawing can only be properly observed from three-dimensions, so time, the fourth dimension, should only really make sense from a fifth dimension or higher. The expanded awareness of LSD seemed, on occasions, to give just such a higher perspective. From this point otherwise invisible patterns and currents in history became apparent. Leary’s belief that his awareness had gone beyond the linear flow of time is actually not as absurd as it might seem at first glance. There is a growing consensus amongst scientists that, while time itself is real, the perceived onward march of time is an illusion. As Einstein once famously wrote to a friend, “The past, present and future are only illusions, even if stubborn ones.” Writing in The Scientific American (Vol. 15 No. 3 2005, p82) Paul Davies concludes that, “The passage of time is probably an illusion. Consciousness may involve thermodynamic or quantum processes that lend the impression of living moment to moment.” He then goes on to note that, “It is possible to imagine drugs that could suspend the subject’s impression that time is passing.” During this period Leary was writing a book about his jail break called It’s About Time , and he would later end his autobiography with the exact same words. The book was later renamed in a direct homage to Crowley; it was published under the name Confessions of a Hope Fiend, a title chosen to consciously reference Crowley’s Diary of a Drug Fiend and Confessions of Aleister Crowley . Shortly afterwards Leary was kidnapped at gunpoint in Afghanistan, brought back to America and placed in solitary confinement in Folsom prison. After making a deal with the FBI that destroyed his reputation amongst many of his hippy followers, he became an evangelist of personal computers and the Internet. He died of cancer on May 31st 1996. According to William Burroughs, “Tim changed the world. It may be another century before he is accorded his rightful stature. Let his detractors shake their heads, a hundred years from now.” It is certainly true that a re- assessment of Leary’s ideas and his impact on There is no figure from the second half of the twentieth century who has a better claim on the continuation of Crowley’s ‘Great Work’ than Dr. Timothy Leary our culture is long overdue. There are those who believe that Leary was successful and did bring about a fundamental and lasting shift in human consciousness for millions of people. There are others who believe he should take the blame for the problems and disillusionment that ended the Sixties dream. But one thing is clear: there is no figure from the second half of the twentieth century who has a better claim on the continuation of Crowley’s ‘Great Work’ than Dr. Timothy Leary.

In May 1955, aged 16, Dr Vallee first sighted a UFO over his Pontoise home. Six years later in 1961, while working as an astronomer, he wit - nessed the destruction of tapes which had re - corded the tracking of unknown objects orbiting the earth. His interest in the UFO phenomenon became a career (of sorts) when he joined with Dr J. Allen Hynek in researching the UFO phe - nomenon for the U.S. Air Force’s well known in - vestigation, Project Blue Book. His contribution to the field was recognized by Steven Spielberg in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, in which the French scientist played by François Truffaut was modeled on him. Since the 1960s, Dr Vallee has written a se - ries of ground-breaking books on the UFO phe - nomenon. His 1969 book Passport to Magonia was instrumental in changing the perspective on anomalous sightings and experiences, as he set forth the hypothesis that the phenomenon was simply the latest incarnation of something which had been happening throughout human history (explained in past ages as fairies, demons, and signs from God). Dr Vallee’s rejection of the ‘nuts and bolts’ explanation of UFOs (as inter - stellar spaceships) gained him a hostile reception from some parts of the research field, leading him to describe himself at one point as a “here - tic among heretics.” In 1979 he again challenged the ufological community with the publication of his book Messengers of Deception , in which he warned against the dangers of UFO cults, gov - ernment deception, and the trickster nature of the phenomenon. Dr Vallee continues to investigate ‘border phenomena’ in his own time. He also serves on the scientific advisory board of Bigelow Aero - space in Las Vegas, Nevada. SR : Many thanks for taking time to talk with us Dr Vallee. First off, the obvious question – you with almost no financial or logistical resourc - es. The few scientists who are still actively in - volved are forming a new version of the old “Invisible College,” communicating privately to stay away from the sensationalism that has tak - en over the field. As for what remains of the organized groups, they are not playing the role of disseminating information, conducting field research or encouraging critique and open de - bate. They are little more than lobbies for a particular point of view. This is a pity, because periods of low UFO activity like the current one present the best opportunity to do quiet research. By centering the whole discussion of the phenomenon on highly-charged, but poor - ly-researched issues like Roswell and abduc - tions, ufologists have lost credibility, alienated the scientific public and opened the floodgates to hundreds of Internet sites where the wild - est rumors circulate. No wonder serious re - searchers are going underground! SR : To set the record straight – from an au - thority in the field, to those less conversant with UFO research – what are the three top cases we should be devoting attention to, in your opinion? Conversely, what are the cases wasting time and resources (from your com - ments above, I’m guessing Roswell is one of them?). Cover Story Cover Story DR JACQUES VALLEE DR JACQUES VALLEE Ufologists have lost credibility, alienated the scientific public and opened the floodgates to hundreds of Internet sites where the wildest rumors circulate haven’t published any books since the Dimen - sions/Confrontations/Revelations trilogy, and your fascinating memoir of the early days of UFO research, Forbidden Science , in the early 1990s. Have you been involved in UFO research over the past decade, and if so, do you plan to write any more on the subject? JV : True, I haven’t published any UFO book since Fastwalker ten years ago, but I have pub - lished several books on other topics, dealing with technology, finance and the history of the Internet. I am finishing an English translation of a novel called Stratagem , which has just been pub - lished in Paris. In the current situation I find it easier to say what I have to say in fiction form. SR : Your fiction novels have actually been some - what overlooked, at least in the English-speak - ing world – you have of course previously won the Jules Verne prize for science fiction writing. The plot of Stratagem appears to have many au - tobiographical elements (UFOs, trips to Brazil, contacts in the technology world, mention of manipulation by intelligence agencies) – do you find that fiction-writing allows you somewhat of a ‘cathartic’ release from your thinking proc - esses, free from the strictures of presenting a reasoned argument (as in a non-fiction book)? And, when can we expect to see Stratagem in the English language? JV : A non-fiction book about paranormal phe - nomena has to describe the available facts and to explore potential hypotheses, but it does not let you develop a complete scenario. In a novel like Stratagem , we can explore one interpretation of what is happening, from beginning to end, and see where it can lead, through characters that are fully involved. This suggests completely new ideas. I have a complete English translation, but I have only begun the process of looking for a U.S. publisher. SR : What are your thoughts on the state of ufology in 2006? JV : It’s a mess. There is valuable research going on, but it is carried out by individuals working The Infamous Pentacle Memorandum"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"March 2006 | S ub Rosa 28 S ub Rosa | March 2006 29 JV : I am not comfortable with the idea of basing the reality of the phenomenon on a few so-called “best cases.” We have to start from a global as - sessment of patterns in a large number of cases where common misidentifications have been screened out. To that end, I have developed a family of four com puter catalogues from several parts of the world, under a new standard for - mat. This requires a major effort but fortunately the tools of database development have evolved rapidly in the last few years. Roswell, in my opinion, is a blind alley. It is a major tactical mistake to base the argument for UFOs entirely on a case that has so little scientific evidence and so much ambiguous and conflicting testimony surrounding it. SR : You first became aware of possible govern - ment manipulation of UFO sightings when you discovered the ‘Pentacle Memorandum’ among Allen Hynek’s papers in 1967. In Messengers of Deception you warned of the dangers of how shadowy groups could manipulate large groups of people into believing certain things and prop - agating the message. The story of Paul Benne - witz, among others, has been a sad validation of your warning. In the modern day, when ru - mours can spread around the globe within min - utes, how is it possible to ‘keep a lid’ on hoaxes and misinformation? It would appear the well is a little too easily poisoned in the Internet Age (perhaps another validation of the advice you received in Messengers of Deception to leave the ‘useful idiots’ to their games and work quietly in the background?). JV : My primary concern, like any scientist work - ing in the field, is to avoid wasting time on pe - ripheral cases and spurious events. That was my initial motivation for calling attention to the fact that serious manipulation of the UFO belief was going on. The military may have had legitimate reasons to plant false UFO stories, for instance to protect the secrecy of certain prototypes: that is none of my business. But it becomes my business when ordinary researchers are used as amplifiers for fake rumors, as was the case in the Bennewitz affair. SR : In the past couple of decades there has been a convergence of multiple strands of re - search, pointing at perhaps one common expe - rience underlying shamanic experiences, UFO sightings and ‘alien abductions’, and Near Death Experiences. Researchers such as Ken Ring, John Mack, and Rick Strassman have all come to conclusions that seem to parallel the ‘Magonia hypothesis’ somewhat (although Mack framed the idea in terms of Henry Corbin’s ‘Imaginal’ world). Considering that you and John Keel ‘pio - neered’ this line of thinking in the 1960s, do you find anything of interest in these more recent lines of research?

We have a long way to go in exploring the connec - tions between high strangeness UFO reports and the parapsychological experience. SR : On those connections – you were a mem - ber of the scientific advisory board for the Na - tional Institute of Discovery Science during the investigation of the so-called ‘Skinwalker Ranch’. The recent book by George Knapp and Colm Kelleher (featured also in this issue of Sub Rosa ) on this investigation featured a great deal of an - ecdotal evidence for anomalous craft, strange beings and poltergeist-like phenomenon. From your point of view, do you feel this investigation was a success, and were there any aspects that were of particular interest to you? JV : I am still a member of that Board, now restructured under Bigelow Aerospace, so I feel bound by the non-disclosure agreement I signed. SR : In considering research into this type of phenomena, is it really possible to approach it via the strict protocols of science? Science itself has become so entrenched with physicalist phi - losophy and the concept of the dominance of humanity – is it a suitable method for studying a phenomenon which may be capable of intel - ligently manipulating observations and results (the ‘trickster’ element often spoken of in the paranormal)? It seems to me that any number of situations – if consciousness can affect reality (and therefore influence test results), if we are within a Matrix-like virtual environment, or as you say that UFOs may be a kind of control sys - tem – then the scientific method may not in fact be the best way of investigating.

And of these, Mary Magdalene is pre-eminent, mentioned first on seven of eight lists of women who ac - companied Jesus. The Gospel narratives are remarkable for their time, a period when wives were treated like mere property – a plow or a chair – and divorced with amaz - ing ease, a period when women were even denied the right to bear witness in court cases. In fact, we discern that the earliest Chris - tian community, relying on radical teachings of Jesus, was surprisingly egalitarian, honoring women in ways unprecedented in their time. In his epistles composed between about A.D. 50-60, Paul occasion - ally mentions Christian women leaders and states that the broth - ers of Jesus and the other apostles who were his earthly companions, including Peter, are now traveling around with their “sister-wives” (1 Cor 9:5). From this inadvertent statement we glean the astonish - ing information that the earliest leaders of the Christian movement traveled as missionary couples, not as pairs of men as we have been inclined to believe. Although the Gospels do not state that Jesus was married, there is no definitive statement any - where in the New Testament that Jesus was celibate, and in Judaism, the norm was mar - riage. According to the very interesting study by Dr. William E. Phipps, entitled, “The Sexu - ality of Jesus,”(1996), Hebrew had no word for bachelor at the time when Jesus lived. I believe that a very important aspect of the ministry of Jesus was his intent to re-establish the partnership paradigm based on the ancient model of “Sacred Marriage.” My personal con - viction that Jesus was married and that he and his wife modeled the hieros gamos as the “ar - chetypal divine couple” rests on the Passion narrative in the canonical Gospels, beginning with the anointing of Jesus by a woman. This significant event was followed by his torture, death, and resurrection, a powerful sequence of events that closely parallels that of numer - ous ancient mythologies and liturgies of pa - gan “bridegroom gods” similarly sacrificed and resurrected. As Jesus was reclining at the banquet table in the town of Bethany, a woman carrying an alabaster jar of precious ointment approached him. She broke the jar open and anointed Jesus with its contents, precious unguent of nard. Then, as her tears fell on his feet, she dried them with her hair. This passionate story was so poignant that it survived for a generation in oral tradition and is one of only a very few stories included in all four of the Gospels that were eventually declared canonical. What was it about the story of this anoint - ing by a woman that was so powerful, so un - braced, and elevated the status of the Femi - nine during his short ministry. These familiar scriptures delight us with stories about wom - en: one widow gives alms to the poor in spite of her poverty, while another sweeps her house in search of a lost coin. Jesus rescues an adulteress from stoning, heals a woman declared “unclean,” and raises the daughter of Jairus from the dead. Mary, sitting at the feet of Jesus and listening ardently to his teachings, is declared to have “chosen the better part,” while her sister Martha is worried about preparations for dinner guests. Courageous women stand near the cross mourning the crucified Lord, while his male apostles appar - ently cower in hiding.

Starbird’s book asks if we recognize the “Sacred Bridegroom/ King” sacrificed for his people, how can we fail to celebrate his beloved Bride – the Mary called “the Tower” – the Magdalene? Amazon U K Amazon U S Starbird And The Sacred Feminine Margaret Starbird has written extensively on both the idea of the ‘sacred feminine’, and also the possible marriage of Christ and the Magdalene. These themes became household words in Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code , and so to did Starbird’s name as the best-selling author explicitly mentioned her book. Here is a selection of required reading from Margaret Starbird: forgettable? Jesus himself proclaimed that wherever the story of his anointing was told, it would be told “in memory of her.” And yet, most people do not even remember her name! Over the years, the unnamed woman who anointed Jesus at the banquet became identified with Mary Magdalene and later was branded a prostitute, a slander which may have derived from the association of the ritual anointing with pagan rites in which the anointing of the sacred King, once the prerogative of his royal bride, was later performed by a hierodule or “sacred prostitute.” Since Neolithic times, the anointing was associated with nuptial rites in cults celebrating the “Sacrificed Bridegroom.” In the liturgical sequence, the Bride and Bride - groom representing fertility deities were typi - cally united in marriage amid widespread re - joicing and revelry. Later the Bridegroom was tortured, mutilated, executed, and entombed. Then, usually after a liturgical pause of three days, the Bride returned to the tomb and found her Beloved resurrected in the garden, a rite celebrated throughout the Near East in the cults of Tammuz/Ishtar, Osiris/Isis, Baal/ Astarte, Adonis/Venus and numerous other divine couples. The entire Hellenized Roman Empire was conversant with this liturgical rite so obvious - ly repeated in the Gospel stories. The word Christos means, literally, “the anointed one.” John’s Gospel states in two places (11:2 and 12:3) that the woman who anointed Jesus was the sister of Lazarus, and it is this same Mary who was conflated with the woman called “the Magdalene” in the early Church. Clearly it was THIS Mary – “the Magdalene” – who performed the final stage of the an - cient ritual, returning with her women com - panions to the tomb to mourn the death of the “Sacrificed Bridegroom” and rejoicing to find him resurrected in the garden, where she embraces and tries to cling to him (John 20). The Gospels deliberately frame her as “Bride” in rites already familiar to the citizens of the empire. Following the Crucifixion, the Roman pun - ishment for sedition, legends tell that Mary Magdalene carried the Holy Grail to the shores of Gaul, arriving in about 42 A.D. with her friends and family in a boat with no oars, fleeing persecution in Judea. Embedded in the core of this body of legends that survive in southern France is the memory of a pre-ado - lescent child, allegedly a servant of the family from Bethany; she appears to be between the ages of nine and twelve and her name “Sarah” means “Princess” in Hebrew, yet legend styles her as a servant.

This legend of a surviving child lies at the core of the bloodline heresy that cannot be proven with facts, but that echoes poignantly through - out medieval European folklore and art – the myth that a royal child descended from Jesus and Mary Magdalene was born after the Cru - cifixion and carried to safety in Gaul. Like Isis, the goddess/consort who bore a child to Osi - ris after his death, the legend seem to attest that Mary Magdalene carried the royal seed of the Davidic line into her exile. The “lost princess” belongs in the realm of legend, a story too dangerous to be told as fact, but one that contrives to confirm the marriage of the “Christ-couple” at the heart of the Christian mythology.

No, he’s not Bigfoot (sure, he’s got a bit of facial hair . . . but that’s where the comparison ends). But he has been in pursuit of the legendary ape-man – as well as numerous other ‘cryptids’ (uniden - tified animals) such as the Loch Ness monster, the African ‘dinosaur’ Mokele-mbembe, and ‘Mothman’ – for more than four decades, and has conducted his almost life-long search as a genuine scientific enquiry.

Even skeptics recognize his position: “Among monster hunters, Loren’s one of the more reputable,” says Benjamin Rad - ford, who is the managing editor of Skeptical Inquirer magazine, the mouthpiece of the ultra- skeptical organization CSICOP. Born in 1947, Coleman found his lifelong vo - cation at an early age: At 12, in 1960, I was reading the books of Charles Fort, which gave me an “open-mind” and “ques - tion authority” attitude when I saw a Japanese movie about the Yeti, entitled “Half Human.” I went to school and asked my teachers what they knew about the Abominable Snowmen. The answers I got were very unsatisfactory, so I be - gan reading and researching all I could on Yeti, Bigfoot, Sasquatch, lake monsters, and more.

His first cryptozoological arti - cle, “Mystery Animals in Illinois”, was published in 1969. In 1975 he co-authored his first book, The Unidentified , with Jerome Clark. Creatures of the Outer Edge, again with Clark, followed this in 1978 (both have just been republished in 2006 as a double-edition book, with a new introduc - tion, by Anomalist Books.) Loren Coleman has since authored more than 25 books and over 500 articles, with his 1983 classic Mysterious America being one of the most popular books ever on the subject of cryptozoology and Fortean topics. What makes Loren Coleman stand out from the field – lon - gevity withstanding – is his rigorous application of scientific principles to the hunt for cryptids. When asked in an interview whether he had a firm belief in the existence of any particular cryptid, Coleman replied: ”Belief,” per se, is the realm of religion and other faith-based systems. As a cryptozoologist, I accept or deny evidence based on an examination and in - vestigation of the data. If a pattern of credible, good evidence exists, I begin to accept the possible reality of a cryptid. If it does not, I reject it, and move on...

His close ties to the media have persisted throughout his career: he has served as a consultant for various televi - sion features including “Unsolved Mysteries,” “Ancient Mysteries”, Animal Planet’s “Twisted Tales,” and Discovery Channel’s “In the Un - known.” Coleman was asked by Sony to assist in the publicity for their 2002 movie The Moth - man Prophecies (directed by Mark Pellington, and based on the book by John Keel), which ended up involving numerous press conferences, and over three hundred radio interviews discussing the factual background to the 1966-1967 events in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. The studio also had Coleman and author John Keel appear in their documentary, Search for the Mothman . He has also written columns for various publica - tions such as The Anomalist and Fortean Times , and is the “go-to” man for the press whenever there is news about anomalous animal sightings or discoveries. However, Coleman is quick to dispel any talk of him being the focal point for cryptozool - ogy. Instead he sees himself purely as the inves - tigator; the collator of evidence: “The world of Bigfoot studies does not revolve around me; it is about the people out there and what they are finding,” he told Henry May in a recent inter - view. “As an investigative journalist, as a field cryptozoologist, and as a scientist interested in cryptozoology, it is more significant to me to have interviewed hundreds, if not thousands of eyewitnesses who have shown me tracks they found, casts they have poured, and photos they have taken.” Beyond his interest in cryptozoology, Cole - man also has an interest in sociology and the impact of the media upon public psychology. As well as his anthropological studies he also studied sociology at the University of New Hampshire and received a graduate degree in psychiatric social work from Simmons College in Boston in 1978. In his 2004 book The Copycat Effect , Cole - man explored how the media’s hyped coverage of murders, suicides, and tragedies (“If it bleeds, it leads”, is how Coleman describes news cov - erage of such events) has a negative impact on our society.

Coleman considers this a tragic flaw of the information age – and that the media must address this problem in order to stop the perpetuation of more violent acts. His experience in sociology also crosses over into his cryptozoology fieldwork – when con - ducting an investigation Coleman doesn’t just interview a witness. He talks to their spouse, their co-workers and friends, to get a read on the person’s state of mind. “When I interview witnesses, I have to evaluate their credibility,” Coleman has said. “You have to put yourself in these people’s shoes . . . how they’re feeling.” Coleman’s interest ‘outside the box’ of zo - ology plainly tags him as a person who thinks scientists should broaden their horizons a little.

In his interview with Henry May, he pointed out that financial gain was not a motivating factor for him. “Material things are unimportant if you can have fun and be on an adventure everyday, and that’s what my sons and my cryptozoology have given me,” he said. “In that way, at least, cryptozoology has made me one of the “richest” humans on earth.” When asked for the highlights of his long career in cryptozoology, Coleman points to his examination of the ‘Dover Demon’ case of 1977, and a 1999 search of Loch Ness with his sons Malcolm and Caleb. Beyond those, he also says finding apelike tracks, and hearing the screeching sounds of an unknown animal during the 1960s were “formative searches.” There’s no doubt though that the pinnacle of his ca - reer would be to find incontrovertible evidence for an 8 feet tall ape-like creature, with very large feet, which is said to roam the forests of the United States.

The alleged Skinwalker curse that surrounds the property provides a blanket explanation among the Utes for the smorgasbord of bizarre activity that’s been seen on the property for more than a century. In late 1994, the Gorman family purchased and moved onto the 480-acre ranch that had been abandoned for almost seven years. The family was looking for an idyllic spot where they could raise their eighty registered black Simintal and Angus cattle for auction. The Gormans were experts in the artificial insemination of cattle and in the manipulation of bloodlines to produce purebred, show-quality animals that routinely sold for many thousands of dollars each. This was no casual ranching operation: the Gormans took it personally if even a single animal was lost during a year. Within a few months of moving onto the property the family began to see strange yellow lights moving among their cattle, above their home, even outside their windows. Valuable cattle began to disappear without a trace. Others were found dead, butchered with precision by unknown forces, often missing internal organs and drained of blood. Who was killing their prized livestock? Neighbors with a vendetta? Or could the mysterious surgeries have some sort of connection to the unidentified lights that were so often seen at night in the Gormans’ pastures? At the same time the family saw huge wolves that made fleeting appearances over a period of weeks and then disappeared altogether. They saw Bigfoot-like creatures prowling their property, heard the ominous growls of large but unknown animals, and were nauseated by overwhelming musk odors generated by unseen beasts that caused cattle, horses, and dogs to cower and panic. Simultaneously, the family encountered silent flying refrigerator- shaped objects that seemed at home on the ranch. As the weeks passed, they experienced Poltergeist activity in their home. Doors would slam open in the middle of the night. Areas of their pasture would suddenly light up after midnight although they could never pinpoint the source of light. Objects would disappear from their home and end up in the washing machine, the microwave oven, in tree branches, or other unusual locations. They routinely observed bright-blue baseball-sized orbs that effortlessly maneuvered around their property and had the effect of dimming the lights in the ranch house whenever they came close. The family witnessed strange clouds filled with exploding silent lights above their home, like scenes from a Steven Spielberg movie. They heard disembodied voices laughing and mocking them in some an unprecedented and courageous scientific undertaking, a study that is every bit as interesting as the strange events that unfolded on the allegedly cursed acreage. The National Institute for Discovery Science was, and is, a unique organization. Created and led by billionaire visionary Robert Bigelow, the purpose of NIDS was to apply the full force and precision of scientific methodology and technology to investigate anomalies. Anomalies here include the elusive unidentified flying object field as well as investigation of unexplained paranormal phenomena. Hunt for the Skinwalker , published in December 2005, is a blow by blow account of an in-depth investigation by NIDS into a ranch in rural Utah that appeared to be a Grand Central Station for all manner of weird and bizarre phenomena, some lethal and others just downright scary. The ranch is located in an out of the way part of North-East Utah known as the Uinta Basin. It is a beautiful, if barren, area with a population of devout Mormons living side by side with several hundred members of the Ute tribe. The ranch in question is essentially surrounded by the Ute reservation.

What we were not told was that the origins of the sickness may already have been here and suspected for a quarter of a century. This illuminating exposé of the threat to the nation’s health reveals for the first time how Mad Cow Disease (a.k.a. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) has jumped species, infecting humans in the form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), and may be hidden in the enormous increase in the number of Alzheimer’s cases since 1979. Detailing the history and biology of Mad Cow Disease, Brain Trust discloses how an investigation into the mysterious deaths in a group of cannibals in a remote part of the world evolved into a research program in the United States that may have had unforeseen and frightening consequences. Exposing the devastating truth about Mad Cow Disease and a new theory of the possible consequences of a little-known government research program and the potential national health catastrophe that may be the result, Brain Trust inoculates Americans with an effective cure: the truth.

They heard metallic banging when they went out for walks at night, as well as the muffled sounds of gigantic machinery emanating from the ground. Tom Gorman began to crawl around in the dead of night in chilly winter conditions trying to catch whatever perpetrator was killing his cattle and conducting such a ruthless exercise in psychological warfare against his increasingly fearful family. Gorman’s teenage kids, who had been straight A students, began to bring home Cs and Ds in their report cards. As time went on and sleeplessness began to catch up with the family, they began to huddle together in the living room of their homestead, sleeping together for safety in case something came out of the darkness to attack them. One time as Tom Gorman lay in the freezing snow watching for any unusual activity, he saw a silent miniature version of the F-117 aircraft moving slowly above the snow as if it was searching for something. The silent craft was no more than twenty feet above the ground and was emitting some dazzling “disco-like” lights on the snow. After Tom stretched his aching bones, the craft suddenly turned towards him as if it heard the sound. It then slowly flew out of his vision. On another quiet evening Ellen Gorman was shadowed by a huge black triangular craft that paced thirty feet above the car as she drove fearfully towards her homestead. Throughout 1994, and continuing on through 1995 and 1996, the Gormans were stalked by something that they could not explain. Something that invaded their privacy, killed their prized cattle and seemed to be able to anticipate their every move. Ellen Gorman began to believe that whatever “intelligence” was on their property could read her mind and seemed to be toying with her in a calculated attempt at driving her insane. In summer 1996, after Tom Gorman lost his three favorite cattle dogs when they were incinerated by a small, blue baseball sized flying orb that appeared to be under intelligent control, his family eventually wore him down and persuaded him to sell the property. The family just wanted to get away from the nightmare that was terrorizing them. In August of 1996, NIDS purchased the property and the Gorman family gratefully moved to another location about 25 miles away where they could begin to catch up on sleep, and stop having their lives subjected to such a continuous, brutal series of nasty attacks. In summer 1996 NIDS hired several mainstream scientists, including a veterinarian, as full time research employees and together with a 16 member science advisory board culled from the top levels of government labs and academia, began the process of creating a laboratory of the paranormal on the remote ranch in Utah. Tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment was deployed on the property and a command and control center was set up staffed by scientists round the clock.

Vanishing and mutilated cattle. Unidentified Flying Objects. The appearance of huge, otherworldly creatures. Invisible objects emitting magnetic fields with the power to spark a cattle stampede. Flying orbs of light with dazzling maneuverability and lethal consequences. For one family, life on the Skinwalker Ranch had become a life under siege by an unknown enemy or enemies. Nothing else could explain the horrors that surrounded them -- perhaps science could. Leading a first-class team of research scientists on a disturbing odyssey into the unknown, Colm Kelleher spent hundreds of days and nights on the Skinwalker property and experienced firsthand many of its haunting mysteries. With investigative reporter George Knapp – the only journalist allowed to witness and document the team’s work – Kelleher chronicles in superb detail the spectacular happenings the team observed personally, and the theories of modern physics behind the phenomena. Far from the coldly detached findings one might expect, their conclusions are utterly hair-raising in their implications. Opening a door to the unseen world around us, Hunt for the Skinwalker is a clarion call to expand our vision far beyond what we know. were fully funded to the tune of millions of dollars, they were staffed by full time professional scientists and they employed several seasoned investigators. This impressive intellectual and financial firepower was then brought to bear on the mysterious Utah ranch. Within a few months, beginning in late 1996 and continuing through early 1997, NIDS scientists were confronted with a litany of terrifying incidents including the brutal killing of a calf in broad day light, encounters with large creatures that left few tracks and seemed to be more ghostly than real, unusual hovering orbs of light, bizarre phenomena that were visible with night vision technology but invisible to normal eyesight, and spikes in magnetic field intensities that seemed to coincide with other strange happenings on the property. In the case of the dramatic killing of a calf on March 10 1997, NIDS forensic pathology research Amazon U S Amazon U K uncovered startling evidence that the calf had been killed in broad daylight and that several different sharp instruments had been used during or after the killing. In addition, something had completely removed all the blood from the calf, without leaving even a drop of blood on or near the animal. The complete removal of every drop of blood from an animal in broad daylight with a couple of eyewitnesses only a few hundred yards away was truly a spectacular feat of derring-do for anyone who has tried to field dress an animal in the middle of the wilderness. NIDS scientists witnessed the same mysterious flying orbs that the Gormans had described, as they moved silently around the property in the dead of night. These incidents were tracked faithfully using the latest scientific technology as they hunted their elusive quarry around the 480-acre property. It was like chasing phantoms. No two incidents they encountered ever seemed alike. The kitchen sink was being thrown at the scientists, and the challenge was to try to capture the endless series of strange happenings either on film, on video or on one of the scientific instruments that were deployed on the property. Thus began an exhilarating exercise in tracking something that was exhibiting all the hallmarks of intelligence; an elusive trickster that appeared to be a couple of steps ahead at all times. Something that could leave an occasional calling card in the form of a brutally ripped up calf carcass, unusual tracks in the snow, tantalizing infrared images, or that could wantonly destroy surveillance equipment while leaving insufficient physical evidence behind that might constitute a smoking gun. Although the trickster often brutally killed animals, humans apparently were spared. Regardless, NIDS scientists were never sure what would come roaring out of the darkness at them as they silently conducted night watches on the remote Utah property. NIDS researchers hunted their elusive quarry month after month while also exploring a range of alternative explanations including unknown natural phenomena or even hoaxes might be responsible. Were there hallucinogenic plants on the property? The answer is no. Was the Utah ranch a playground for testing exotic military toys on unsuspecting people, including holographic technology? Was it an experimental arena for the testing of advanced assassination (by silently killing cattle) techniques used by special forces? Was the ranch a paranormal meeting place for all kinds of cryptids? Was there a dimensional “portal” located on the property? As the team methodically eliminated some of the more mundane possibilities, more and more exotic hypotheses for the high strangeness seemed to assert themselves. As the ‘hunt for the Skinwalker’ unfolded, the search ultimately led some of the scientists to begin looking at reality in a whole new way. They began to ask the question: is it possible that exotic concepts in physics like multiple dimensions, or traversable wormholes, or string theory, or brane multiverses, might have some counterpart in the real world here on Earth?

Hunt for the Skinwalker draws on the bizarre experiences documented by scientists to ask some very fundamental questions about the nature of reality. Our book came about after one of us, Emmy award winning investigative journalist George Knapp, was allowed on the Utah property beginning in 2002 to report on some of the bizarre activity that had successfully operated under the radar since 1996. His two articles, entitled Path of the Skinwalker , were published in a Las Vegas newspaper in 2002 and quickly found a worldwide audience as tens of thousands of paranormal enthusiasts eagerly downloaded the narratives. George’s articles broke the silence on the NIDS research which had been conducted in near-total secrecy for several years. The newspaper articles were the inspiration for Hunt for the Skinwalker , which describes the unprecedented scientific investigation of anomalous activity, an effort that evolved into a multi-year contest of wills between technology and the “trickster”. The book is also a wake up call for science about the potential importance of studying anomalies and about the possibility that human understanding of the nature of reality seems poised on the cusp of fundamental shift. These studies may be the doors that open up new avenues of discovery – and in doing so, all of what constitutes reality may have to be re-examined.

A billionaire businessman interest - ed in the search for alien life hears of the high weirdness, and buys the ranch outright, send - ing in his own professional team of scientists to study the phenomenon with magnometers, infra-red binoculars and video cameras. They see beings crawling out of ‘portals’, beasts with glowing eyes hanging from trees in the dark of night, and even have telepathic messages from a UFO-like entity invade their mind. A ny Hollywood producer reading a movie script with that for a logline might start salivating. But, unbelievably, the story is true (well, they would probably just start drooling hearing that fact). In Hunt for the Skinwalker , investigative journalist George Knapp and molecular biologist Colm Kelleher tell the story of the so-called ‘Skinwalker Ranch’, which has reached almost legendary status in recent years among ‘border experience’ researchers due to the small amount of publicly available information about it. Not that Knapp needs to employ a great deal of investigative nous for this book, as his co- author Kelleher was the lead scientist involved in the research, so one might therefore call this the official version of what occurred. The book is divided into three parts. It begins with Part 1 - “The Hotspot”, telling the story of rancher Tom Gorman (not his real name) who bought the 480 acre property in the fall of 1994, as well as sharing some of the related history of the location (including Native American myths and fireside stories of occult Masonic influences). If you live alone on farmland somewhere, this isn’t the best book to be reading late at night. The Gorman family catalogued a nightmarish range of phenomena, which included the deaths of both their livestock and the family pets. ‘Flying refrigerator’ UFOs are seen (a curious echo of Vallee’s research in Brazil?), unkillable foul-smelling beasts turn up regularly, and even a ‘portal’ in the sky opens up on numerous occasions. Part 2 - “The Investigation Begins” continues the tale from 1996, when billionaire real estate entrepreneur Robert Bigelow bought the ranch as a ‘live laboratory’ for his newly formed National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS). NIDS had been created with the express intention of supporting scientific investigation into ‘border sciences’ - the paranormal, UFOs etc. Kelleher recounts his first visit to the ranch (on which he was to spend many months), and then goes on to list a number of strange experiences witnessed by members of the NIDS team. These events bring some credibility to the Skinwalker Ranch story, with the word of reputable scientists and former law enforcement officers lending support to Gorman’s anecdotal account. Ultimately however, despite the long hours and scientific rigour devoted to the investigation, the NIDS team were unable to come up with much evidence of note – at least, I don’t see skeptics changing their opinion based on what is offered in Hunt for the Skinwalker . Nevertheless, the first two parts of the book will be gripping reading for those not familiar with the story of the Skinwalker Ranch. For those who have kept up with the story via the Internet (with necessary filtering of outlandish rumours), there won’t be a lot more to learn beyond the facts delivered by George Knapp in his earlier 3-part “Path of the Skinwalker” article for the Las Vegas Mercury (available as PDF files from www.huntfortheskinwalker.com). However, the third part of the book, “Aftermath and Hypotheses”, is worth the price of the book. It delivers the thoughts, feelings and conclusions which the NIDS team came to on the basis of what they witnessed, and also explores possible models and theories for what is happening. Parallel universes, imaginal realms, Vallee’s Magonia...all are mentioned, which means here we have another book pointing at cross-overs between various fields of research such as ufology, shamanism and consciousness. Hunt for the Skinwalker is certainly a gripping read, one of the few books of late which I’ve found myself continually picking up during the day to read ‘just one more chapter’. However, after waiting so long for some official word on the Skinwalker Ranch research, I was also disappointed by the lack of evidence which resulted, and also some of the methodology. Colm Kelleher points out in the Preface: In addition to eyewitness testimony, we obtained an intriguing body of physical evidence to support many of the accounts described in the book. We compiled photos and videos and accumulated reports of demonstrable physical effects on people, animals, equipment, everyday objects, and the environment. If this is the case, it’s a shame that more wasn’t shared with the reader. A few colour plates, or even tabulated or graphed data, may have helped in raising the story from feeling like a modern urban legend, into its rightful place as a fascinating scientific investigation. Some extremely interesting magnetic fields were recorded in the wake of anomalous phenomena occuring on the ranch. Why not describe these in more detail? Likewise, a couple of times in the book one of these ‘physical effects on people’ is off-handedly mentioned – blood noses. This sounds intriguing, so why not share more about the circumstances under which it happened, etc.? Obviously, Hunt for the Skinwalker is intended as a popular read, so I may be perhaps asking for more than is required – if so though, I hope some hard data is released at some point in another form. Beyond that criticism though, I was also perplexed by a number of things about Hunt for the Skinwalker Colm A.

At one point, the NIDS investigators and Gorman give chase to an entity in the middle of the night, and witness it sitting in a tree. Gorman promptly jumps from the vehicle and unleashes a round from his rifle at it. Was this ‘shoot-to-kill policy’ – against an apparently intelligent entity – agreed with by NIDS? It would seem so, as no criticism is levelled at Gorman for his actions. Indeed, the fact that NIDS kept Gorman on at the ranch as caretaker is also a strange decision – one of the first examinations of the Gorman story would have to consider the hoax explanation. To avoid any further ‘contamination’ of the investigation by this possibility, Gorman should have been excluded when the research began. To be fair, the authors do give some reasons, such as that the paranormal events may have been ‘attracted’ to him in some way. But overall, this is a nagging problem throughout the book. The tabloidish descriptions of Gorman throughout the book (a proud man, a simple man, a great rancher, a man with “the perfect eyesight of a trained marksman”) only further inflame the skeptical mind...it’s almost as if the authors need us to believe this man, so they lavish praise on him. Ironically, in describing why the Gorman’s bought the ranch, they sometimes actually throw doubt on his background...it was to “get away from the busybodies and the closed community that kept prying into their lives”, to escape the rumour mill of their previous small town life. These privacy problems were probably more to do with their Mormon background, but in all I finished the book with grave doubts about the Gormans’ side of the story - though I have to say they were redeemed somewhat by the support lent by NIDS investigators in the second half of the book. All in all though, Hunt for the Skinwalker is an important chronicle of one of the few scientific investigations of a paranormal hotspot. It will be an eye-opening account for those new to the subjects of the Skinwalker Ranch and ‘border experiences’, and will no doubt also serve as a topic of great debate within the ‘discovery science’ research community. Kelleher and Knapp sum up the investigation well in their concluding remarks in the book: T he investigation of the phenomena at the Gorman ranch was an ambitious if unconventional example of what science is supposed to do. Explore the unknown. Ask questions about the unexplained. Poke around and see what happens. Honest inquiry into unanswered questions is – or should be – a textbook definition of what science does...But finding answers is not always part of that definition even when engaged in “normal” science...though we can eliminate a few of the hypotheses – hoax, group hallucination, and tectonic strain theory – there is simply insufficient data to be able to select a likely solution to the events. Part of the difficulty in this scientific investigation was the ‘trickster’ element so often described in paranormal events – as if an intelligence is making the decisions as to what is observed and when, which is hardly conducive to the replicability and hard objective results required by science. As mentioned, I do have my doubts as to this book’s ability to change any skeptic’s mind on the matter, but hopefully further data from the investigation will be forthcoming in different forms. In the meantime, those interested in these phenomenon will be able to scan this chronicle for items of interest to their own research. And if a Hollywood producer doesn’t option the film rights on this one soon, I’m going to have to get a bank loan and snap it up myself – an unbelievable story.

Alford T h e nature of Egyptian culture, religion and mythology have been hotly debated within both the realms of academia and within mainstream society since the opening of the first tomb. The complexities of Egyptian myth have led to many differing interpretations and none have really proved comprehensive in their decoding of the many levels of mythology. The prevailing key for interpretation has been a solar interpretation of the myths and while this has offered some impressive insights it has always left more questions unanswered than it solved. In The Midnight Sun Alan Alford takes a different tack; he believes that the key to the nature of Egyptian society and its mythology is found not in a solar tradition, but within its creation story. While he does not devalue the importance of the solar sphere within their traditions, he shows clearly that it must be differentiated from the creator role that has been traditionally associated with it and only by placing it back in its correct context Reviews can a full appreciation of the Egyptian world view be gained. This may seem dry and theoretical, but Alford’s decoding of Egyptian mythology is one of the most complete and comprehensive that has been published. By using the creation myth as an interpretative key he has been able to open up many areas of Egyptian mythology which had been at best perplexing, at worst undecipherable. He offers a whole new paradigm of Egyptian theology and philosophy which has startling ramifications. Through his model we gain a deeper understanding of the nature of Egyptian myth and a far more credible explanation of the significance of the pyramids and mummification. We also gain a more perceptive insight into the relationship between the king, his people and the ‘other world¹ and we start to appreciate how the Egyptians achieved what they did. To top off this fascinating exploration, Alford uses this new interpretation to explain the mystery of the empty tomb within the Great Pyramid and show where the real tomb – probably still intact and holding greater treasures that that of Tutankhamun – lies. This is a superb book, meticulous and comprehensive. While it may prove heavy going for those who do not have a background in Egyptology, its significance should not be underestimated for the scholar or layman. If Alford¹s interpretation is correct, he has not only overturned the major philosophical edifice within Egyptology, but solved some of its greatest mysteries and perhaps even uncovered the true missing tomb within the Great Pyramid!

Sweet Mother Mercy Yachay W hat would you get if Simon and Garfunkel met up with the Vio - lent Femmes during an ayahuasca ritual in the South American jun - gle? The result might be Yachay, a two piece acoustic group which incorporates Peruvian tribal sounds with fine acoustic guitar work and well-constructed harmonies, Yachay ca me into being in 2003, when gui - tarist William Ward met up with percussion - ist Jeff C urnutt in the Peruvian jungle. Both had recently given up playing professional gigs in favour of spiritual advancement through im - mersing themselves in shamanic experiences within a native setting. Ironically, their chance meeting led them full circle and back to their starting point. Curnutt and Ward’s shamanic experiences with ayahuasca, in particular the icaros facet (sacred songs sung by the tribal shamen dur - ing the visions), opened their eyes to the vital importance of sound vibrations in the creation of reality. Yachay’s music is thus grounded in the most primal of sounds – driving acoustic guitars and percussion, mixed with vocal harmonies – designed to add as many positive musical vi - brations to our current reality as possible. Sweet Mother Mercy consists of eleven tracks, which are sung in both English and Spanish, as well as some chanting in Quechua. “Pach - amama” leads things off nicely with just such a chant mixed over a delicate guitar riff initially, before the music amps up into a more rock- oriented sound. “Construyo un Feugo” sounds like a Mexican Violent Femmes cover band (an overly simplistic description, but a good way to ‘visualise’ it). “Diosa” is an absolute standout, a slow burner based on an understated guitar riff, while “Corazon Sonico” is everything the previous track isn’t – lightning finger work on the acoustic guitar lights this track up. Towards the end of the album, “Shield” brings off-cen - tre timing and riffage to the party...in fact, if the guitar was put through overdriven amps it would sound distinctly prog-metalish. To find fault in the album is mainly to find fault with Yachay’s whole approach to creating music. At times I felt Sweet Mother Mercy could have benefited from bigger production – some - one like Daniel Lanois would be perfect for widening the landscape behind the songs. I also think the percussion loses a bit in the recording process from when Yachay plays live, and could definitely benefit from high quality engineering and production to let it drive into the listener’s consciousness with greater ease. On a few occasions, the harmonies could have been tighter, and perhaps a couple of ex - tra acoustic instruments would have given more variety to the sound. But that goes against what Yachay is – stripped down, primal, and as close to the source as possible. For lovers of World Music, or just ‘real music’ in general, this is well worth a listen. Reviews R eviews www.yachaymusic.com Solomon’s Treasure Tracy R. Twyman Amazon U S Amazon U K W i th interest growing in the content of Dan Brown’s next novel – ru - moured to be titled The Solomon Key , and apparently exploring the Masonic inf luence on the founding of the United States – readers are likely to see a number of titles which reference these mem es. One of the latest is Solomon ’s Treasure by Tracy R. T wyman, former editor of Dagobert’s Revenge magazine and a regular writer on topics including secret societies and ‘alternative history’. Twyman has been active in researching th ese topics since the pre- Brown days though, so one could hardly des cribe her as a bandwagon-jumper. As mentioned above, Solomon’s Treasure is grounded in the facts surrounding the invo lve - ment of Freemasonry in the founding of the U.S. However, it uses this simply as its launching point, and hea ds more specifically into inves - tigating the correlation between the esoteric doctrines of Masonry and the economic prin - ciples that underpin the American economy. The obvious link to most is the strange iconog - raphy found on the dollar bill, such as the all- seeing-eye and unfinished pyramid. However, Twyman goes far beyond this case only, with a detailed exposition of the development of money and economics through history (though thankfully, not into the actual fine points of economic theory!) At less than 200 pages, one would think this book might be a bit short to discuss such an involved subject – however, there is a lot of in - formation to get through, with Twyman packing as much as possible into every page. After in - troducing the topic with the familiar dollar bill, she runs through an esoteric history of financial affairs, from King Solomon through the Knights Templar, and up to the present day Federal Re - serve. The theme throughout is that money is a magical creation, a talisman which requires reli - gious faith to work correctly. Twyman equates the creation of money by the Federal Reserve, and its exponential multiplication through the economic system, to the alchemical creation and multiplication of gold from lead – the ‘Great Work’ . Along the way she reveals numerous fascinating instances of ‘hidden history’ which are sure to keep the reader intrigued. As with most ‘ hidden history’ genre books though, there are problems. Some solid refer - encing would have benefited the book, as some claims are made that are simply wrong (as far as my knowledge extends anyhow). For instance, in Chapter 1 T wyman says that all but one of the designers of the Great Seal were Free - masons ...when the evidence (a gain, as far as I know) shows that most of them in fact were not. If I ’m wrong about claims such as thi s, a ref - erence is required to s et me straight. This ref - erencing should also extend to the etymological word associations by Twyman, as it’s difficult to tell if she is theorising or simply repeating established fact. T oo much is made of number coincidences as well, such as the 13 engravers working for the Treasury (corresponding to the Great Seal’s preponderance of the number 13) . However, there is also much to like about this book. Despite my complete lack of enthu - siasm for the history and workings of monetary systems, the book kept me engaged , and also enlightened me at times on aspects of hidden history which even I wasn’t aware of, despite researching similar areas. Twyman has taken an original line of rese arch in the hidden history field (money), and made the su bject her own."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"March 2006 | S ub Rosa 76 S ub Rosa | March 2006 77 D ean Radin, respected parapsychology researcher and author of The Conscious Universe , returns with a new book this April. Entangled Minds equates quantum entan - glement (‘spooky action at a distance’) with psychic phenomena such as telepathy, clair - voyance, and psychokinesis.
