I hope you get as much enjoyment from reading the magazine as we did in putting it together. Please feel free to contact us with your thoughts about our new baby. And it is a baby – each issue we intend to add more content and new features to this newborn. I hope you stay with us as we watch it grow. Why the name, I hear you ask? Well firstly, because it just popped into my head without any logical analysis, and I always tend to trust my intuitive side (on the odd occasions when it graces me with its presence). Secondly, I find it very apt: the name originates in the Roman myth of Cupid giving a rose to Harpocrates (the baby Horus) as thanks for his ability to keep a secret. The Romans decorated the ceilings of banquet rooms with roses to remind guests that what was spoken within was ‘sub rosa’ (under the rose) – that is, in confidence. Certainly, the magazine is not about secrecy – I hope it finds its way into the hands of as many enquiring individuals as is possible. But throughout the ages, it has been necessary to talk about our subject matter – hidden history, esoteric traditions, and new paradigm science – in hushed tones, due to the extreme personal danger that came with such heretical views. And while these days we may not be burned at the stake, there is still much opposition from both organised religion and orthodox science. So in the spirit of the past we meet here, within the pages of this magazine, ‘sub rosa’. Also, with our dislike of following the well- beaten path, we are trying new things with Sub Rosa . If you have a constant Internet connection, you’ll find you can click on links within this PDF and be taken to that page in your web browser. If you are interested in any of the books, CDs or DVDs we mention then simply click on its image and you will be taken to the relevant page at Amazon. Also, for those with broadband connections, you can click on movie or audio icons where applicable to access that content (for example, click on the “What the Bleep DVD” icon to view the trailer). The design of the magazine is by the abundantly talented Mark James Foster, of Artifice Design. I’m your host, Greg Taylor. And each issue we’ll have contributions from some of the leading lights of the ‘alternative’ scene – this issue you’ll find columns by Ian Lawton and Michael Grosso, and a great piece by Philip Coppens on the legendary Terence McKenna. Needless to say, it takes quite a bit of work to put together a magazine like this, so we look for - ward to working with any sponsors who might wish to be a part of the project. We will soon be releasing a rate card for advertising within the magazine – please contact us if interested. I believe that we’ve got the beginnings of some - thing great here – fascinating content, beautiful design, and best of all it’s free. Read on, and feel free to send us your feedback!

Nata - lia Demkina – known as the ‘Girl with X-ray eyes’ – says that she can also spot internal injuries just by looking at a photograph. Tests in London and New York led to mixed conclusions. British scientists found evidence to support the girl’s claims, but a test by the Discov - ery Channel in the US found that she could not sat - isfy the conditions set to indicate a successful trial. Demkina correctly picked four out of seven medical conditions, which was marked as a failure by the investigating team. However, Nobel Prize winner Brian Josephson criticised the American tests, say - ing the criteria for a successful trial was not based on scientific principles. “The initial decision to consider a score of 4 hits out of 7 as ‘failure’ when the probability of getting such a score is less than two per cent (i.e. odds of 50 to 1 against) is hardly in step with normal scien - tific practice,” Dr Josephson said in a report on his website. He also questioned the motives of the in - vestigating team, as they were lead by well-known skeptics Paul Wiseman and Ray Hyman, who are both affiliated with the Committee for Scientific In - vestigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). “Wiseman, when questioned about this, ap - peared to know about the 50 to 1 statistic, but would not accept that the cutoff point had been set wrongly,” said Dr Josephson. “He admits that the result is ‘interesting’, but is then quoted as saying: ‘At best, she’s done this a lot and she has a real ex - pertise at being able to look at people and make rea - sonably accurate diagnoses.’ Perhaps realising that this statement might not quite convince, he goes on Nobel Prize Winner Disputes CSICOP Testing Procedure ‘X-ray’ Girl Causes Controversy to suggest that perhaps Natasha cheated, a handy way to evade the issue.” Dr Josephson made his feelings clear: “Ma - nipulation of concepts such as ‘failure’, and the abuse of statistics, are commonplace in the world of propaganda. Is that what is happening here, or honest science?” More recent tests have supported Dr Josephson’s claims, with researchers at Tokyo University finding that Demkina does seem to have some paranormal ability – although they dispute the idea that she has ‘X-ray eyes’. The latest experiments were carried out by Pro - fessor Yoshio Machi at Tokyo University, who spe - cialises in studying anomalous human abilities. “We did a whole range of tests, and the strangest thing was that we found she could also use her abilities on photographs, even on tiny passport photos,” Dr Machi said. “She was able to look at them and apparently see what the problem was. Her ability is not X-ray vision, but she definitely has some kind of talent that we can’t explain yet.” (Source: www.ananova.co m and www.tcm.phy. cam.ac.uk / ) Photograph © 2004 Andrew Skolnick"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Sub Rosa | June 2005 3 News News Briefs A South American archaeolo - gist has claimed that a group of about 50 drawings of gi - ant figures, recently discovered in the hills of Peru’s southern coastal desert near the city of Palpa, pre - date the nearby Nazca Lines by four centuries.

A geologist and an engineer have claimed that the true message of the Kensington Runestone may be concealed by a secret code. The piece of rock, found more than a century ago, is considered by some as evidence that Norwegians beat Columbus to the Americas. It was found by farmer Olaf Ohman, and bears an inscription that places Norwegians in Minne - sota in 1362. Carved in runes, the message reads: “Eight Goths and 22 Norwegians on an exploration journey...10 men red with blood and dead...14 days journey from this island...year 1362.” Orthodox historians claim that Ohman authored the inscription himself, and say that the language on the rune stone is too modern and some of the runes are made up. However, geologist Scott Wol - ter says that tests prove the stone had been carved well before Ohm - an found it. “If this is a hoax, he lied to his two sons, he lied to his family, lied to his neighbors and friends and lied to the world.” Wolter says that he also found one of the so-called invented runes in a medieval text, refuting the ex - pert’s view.

Wol - ter and Texas engineer Dick Nielsen believe that two crossed runes may be a pointer to a concealed code. “Maybe they’re saying, ‘Pay atten - tion to me,’” Wolter said.

Despite intimidatingly bad reviews, I faithfully attended the showing of The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy at my local movie theatre – knowing full well that it would be an impossibility to recreate the literary and comic genius of DNA on the big screen. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that his books have been a formative influence on my personal philosophies. That’s not to say I agree with everything he had to say (Adams tragically passed away in May 2001, aged just 49). He was an atheist; I’m more of a deist (though with a strong thread of Gnosticism thrown in). And later in his life, he became a vigorous defender of science. I, on the other hand, think sci - ence needs to be challenged regularly – for reasons which I’ll outline below. A number of Adams’ miscel - laneous articles, unpublished writings and mus - ings were released to the public in the post-hu - mous anthology The Salmon of Doubt . The topics range from the benefits of whisky to the dangers of climbing a mountain dressed in a rhino suit; the tone from zany to serious. And as would be expected of an avowed atheist, more than one of the essays delves into the subject of religion. In the essay “Is There An Artificial God?” (actually a transcript of a 1998 speech), Adams queries the sanctity of religion as a topic of debate and criticism: Religion...has certain ideas at the heart of it which we call sacred or holy or whatever...we are used to not challenging religious ideas, but it’s very interesting Columns GREG TAYLOR how much of a furor Richard [Dawkins] creates when he does it! Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it because you’re not allowed to say these things. Yet when you look at it rationally, there is no reason why those ideas shouldn’t be as open to debate as any other. I couldn’t agree more. I might qualify his com - ments by saying that, in my opinion, the reason for the sanctity is because the topic of religion is one which affects a person to their deepest core - their philosophical framework and worldview has often grown out of that very subject. That certainly doesn’t make it exempt from debate – we could only wish that more people challenged the Nazi ide - ology before it reached critical weight – only that we should at least recognise the reason behind an individual’s sensitivity to the subject of religion. What really surprised me about the senti - ments expressed in this speech, however, is that just a few pages earlier in an article titled “Turn - coat”, Adams had expressed his disgust at a co - median making fun of scientists – recalling it as the moment when he “fell out of love” with the idea of making fun of science (which he read - ily admits was a part of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy ). The comedian had just told the joke about why aeroplanes aren’t made of the mate - rial which the virtually indestructible ‘black box’ is made from: The audience roared with laughter at how stupid scientists were...but I sat feeling uncomfortable.

There was no way of deconstructing the joke that didn’t rely on the teller and the audience complacently conspiring together to jeer at someone who knew more than they did. It sent a chill down my spine and it still does. Actually, it’s quite easy to deconstruct the joke to its basic humour: irony. We rely on an inde - structible piece of equipment within an object to help us understand why it was destroyed. I certainly don’t feel like I’m laughing at science when I react to that joke – although I do laugh at scientists or authors who might feel that it would be wrong to do so. So why did Adams react so strongly? What this illustrates is that Adams is wrong in saying that only religion has this untouchable sanctity.

To be sure, religion takes a large portion of the cake when it comes to that topic. But so does modern science – and if you don’t believe me, try raising your personal doubts about Darwinian evolution, the age of the Sphinx, or the capabilities of the human mind with the relevant groups of scientists. Science needs challenging, and all topics should be fair game. If you’re a scientist and you’re frowning right now, then I rest my case. Our knowledge of the Universe and ourselves can only grow when we live in doubt about all claims, fringe or orthodox.

Nor have I any idea whether James Randi, who in 1996 set up a million dollar prize for anyone who could demonstrate any psychic, supernatural or paranormal ability, has that kind of money. After all, he is a showman first and foremost, and his supposed “prize” funds his ego far more than any serious scientific research. But if I did I would have no hesitation in putting it on the table as a spiritual counter-challenge to him and his sceptic colleagues. However, I would not take Randi on in the paranormal field of telepathy and telekinesis, as fascinating as these phenomena are. Instead, I would lay out my battlefield using a combination of modern research. First, I would make the argument that modern theoretical physics has amply demonstrated two key facts: that there exist multiple non- physical dimensions about which we can only speculate at present; and that even our supposedly “physical” realm is merely an illusion, because in fact there are no fundamental “building blocks of matter”. Instead, at the subatomic level we have nothing more than minuscule packets of energy whose rate of vibration determines whether or not they are measurable in the “physical” dimension. For those who are not familiar with the concepts of quantum mechanics and string theory, all I will add is that this is genuine accepted science – albeit science that needs much more work – and not fringe speculation. Second, I would use the evidence of near- death experiences to argue that consciousness Challenge To Columns IAN LAWTON exists independently of the physical brain. The best cases involve the recall of obscure objects or events in operating theatres or other environments that simply could not have arisen by pure guesswork or chance, and which are subsequently independently verified. In all such cases the subjects were at the very least unconscious – which according to conventional science should mean that they were incapable of forming and then recalling coherent mental models – and in some they were in deep coma, had been deliberately rendered completely brain dead according to all three medical definitions, or had even been pronounced dead and were lying in a mortuary for three days! Third, I would evince the evidence of children who spontaneously remember past lives to support the principle of reincarnation. Again, the best evidence in this field involves cases in which the investigators were able to get involved early enough to be able to test the verifiable recall of the subjects under properly monitored conditions. And that is before we even consider the quite incredible evidence of children who have birthmarks or other defects that correspond exactly to the verifiable wounds that caused the death of the past personality they claim to have been. Fourth, I would back this up with the evidence from hypnotic regression into past lives. Although much of this can be argued to be flawed, there still exist a significant number of cases in which, once again, the details subsequently verified are Without exception these debunking attempts are reductionist and simplistic in the extreme The Sceptics A Spiritual"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Sub Rosa | June 2005 9 Columns IAN LAWTON so obscure that they could not be the product of guesswork or chance. Some of the best cases are in fact little known in the West, because they come from Australia. Now, necessarily I have had to summarise the available evidence here to a ridiculous degree. Any sceptic could pull this summary apart with ease. But in my latest book I have documented all the prime material, and have examined all the paranormal as well as materialist explanations. In this latter context I have analysed all the attempts by the usual suspect sceptics – members of CSICOP such as Paul Kurtz, Martin Gardner, Susan Blackmore and Richard Wiseman – to debunk the evidence that has been collated in these different fields. And I have to report that this latter exercise is none too demanding. Without exception these debunking attempts are reductionist and simplistic in the extreme – in fact laughably so – and make no attempt whatsoever to address the full range and depth of the various aspects of evidence presented in the now tens of thousands of cases of near-death experience, and of spontaneous or hypnotic past- life recall. Indeed, the real alternative to a spiritual explanation is downright fraud right across the board – and even most sceptics would accept that this is not a tenable proposition. That is why I use this ensemble of modern evidence to argue that, at the start of the twenty- first century, we finally have enough material to develop a rational spiritual worldview. One which on the balance of probabilities – and while accepting that we do not yet have all the answers – is a far more logical way of looking at the world than that put forward by the atheist western intellectual elite.

At the start of the twenty-first century, we finally have enough material to develop a rational sp iritual worldview to contain serious distortions. So, my challenge to any materialist sceptic is this. Take a look at the evidence I have presented. Make a genuine attempt to provide a rational, materialist explanation for all of it, rather than just any bits that you might like to cherry-pick because you think they provide easy targets. If you succeed, then I cannot give you a million pounds, but your reward will be to sleep easy in your bed, safe in the knowledge that your materialist worldview does stand up to the closest intellectual scrutiny.

There were signs of worldviews in transformation. The belief that apocalyptic change is possible goes back to the Hebrew prophets, and to Zoroaster, where the idea of true novelty was born. The same expectations of renewal still haunt us at the dawn of the 21st century, except that today science is the keystone to the New Jerusalem. In this column — this is the first — we’ll ring some changes on the “new paradigm archetype” (a way of talking about our perennial passion to “Revise the Big Picture”). Not to be shy about grab - bing the metaphysical bull by the horns, let’s start with a book that puts mysticism on the map of neu - roscience. What (the late) Eugene d’Aquili and Andrew Newberg have done in The Mystical Mind (1999) is provide authoritative speculation on how the brain might mediate mystical con - sciousness. This is important because if some scholars are right, mysticism is the living core of all religions, and even prophecy and shamanism may be seen as derivative by comparison. Much to their credit, d’Aquili & Newberg re - sist the temptation to reduce mystical experience to “neurochemical flux.” They acknowledge the primacy of consciousness. They call attention to what may be the most interesting, if not the most important, psychological experience. They then try to integrate it — nonreductively — into the latest brain science. This brings mysticism in - side the camp of science; and by rhetorical magic makes it more “real” and “legitimate.” Using imaging technologies to monitor the brains of advanced Buddhist and Catholic nun meditators, they found that some parts of the brain were excited to greater activity while oth - ers were selectively inhibited. By willing to empty one’s mind of all thoughts, a part of the brain that helps distinguish subject from object, self from other, is damped down, creating an experience of unbounded consciousness. It appears that mystics are very clever. They have discov - ered how to manipulate their brains in order to experience pure unitary consciousness; a state described as ineffable, beyond all rational efforts, and ( nota bene ) intrinsically bliss - ful. This whole evolutionary ploy is startling. As soon as the brain gets smart enough, it turns around and figures out how to transcend itself. The mystic is drawn to enter - ing these seductive states, at first transiently, of undifferentiated consciousness. Plausible neuropsychological accounts show how mental training may induce this. This may be one of the finest achievements of our species — the experimental discovery of the mystical mind. Several approaches to inducing such states are known.

But meditation — the persistent stimulation of the prefrontal brain — remains the old standby for most sailors of the sea of spirit. The good news is that a pro-active stance before the mys - teries is possible; a kind of science, if you will, of inspiration. Many believe that mystical experience is the common core of the great religions. They argue that it would be wise to rally around the central unifying experience of humankind. Instead of divisive doctrine, they suggest, let us seek unitive experience. In light of the current global conflict between Bush’s Christian messianism and Al-Qaeda’s anti-infidelism, talk of exploring the mystical core of religion may seem utopian, but then so did countless great ideas that often came haltingly before their time. Some experts think mysticism is pathologi - cal or regressive. Others see therapeutic indica - tors of higher reaches of human development, as for example in Buddhism, which revolves around methods of inducing nirvana, a mystical state of consciousness. Mystics enjoy intuitive knowledge of immor - tality, according to Bucke’s Cosmic Conscious - ness . The fear of death vanishes placed against the brilliant light of eternity.

Schoch studied the erosion patterns on the limestone body of the Sphinx, analysed sub- surface weathering patterns via seismic surveys, and compared the climatic history of the Giza area. His conclusion was stunning: the Great Sphinx was not only built before Khafre’s time, but that its origins must go back into the fog of pre-history, at the very least to 5000 BCE and perhaps even earlier. Schopenhauer once wrote: “Every truth passes through three stages be - fore it is recognized.

Perhaps this ancient tale should be taken as fair warning that the Sphinx does not look kindly upon those who attempt to solve her mysteries.

Sub Rosa : The ‘Age of the Sphinx’ debate has been one of the great archaeological controversies over the past fifteen years. A lot of discussion has ensued since the water-weathering theory was first put forward. Could you update readers on where we are currently, and if your view has changed at all in response to contributions from other researchers, such as Gauri and Reader? Cover Story Schoch : Independently of my work, and independent of each other, the geologists David Coxill and Colin Reader have each confirmed my core hypothesis regarding the age of the Great Sphinx, namely that the earliest portion is older than the common modern Egyptological attribution to the reign of the pharaoh Khafre, circa 2500 B.C. Some of the critics continue to suggest ad hoc and geologically unfeasible and unrealistic scenarios to maintain the traditional dating, but as I discuss in the appendix to Voyages of the Pyramid Builders , their arguments are not sound in my opinion. The real issue is not if the Sphinx is older than Khafre, but how much older and the significance of this greater antiquity. SCHOCH TO THE SYSTEM ” “"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Sub Rosa | June 2005 17 SR : Having said that, your theory remains controversial and is not accepted by most orthodox Egyptologists. Someone commented on MSNBC’s “Cosmic Log”, that if we can work out Martian history based on a robot’s observations, then surely a group of geologists should be able to figure out a consensus concerning the age of the Sphinx. Why do you think this hasn’t happened yet, and considering this - will it ever? How do you go about removing any shred of doubt about your findings? Schoch : I would disagree with the basic premise of the question. Science, ultimately, is not an issue of consensus (although generally that comes along at some point), but a matter of gathering data and cogently analysing and interpreting it. At any given time, the majority can be wrong, or the majority can be right. It is the nature of science to doubt and question the accepted wisdom. Scientific “truth” is not arrived at by a committee recommendation. In the case of the Great Sphinx, whenever I have presented my data and analyses, most geologists have found it compelling, but I don’t expect them to publicly “endorse” it without pursuing their own field studies, and the typical geologist does not have the incentive, time, money, or interest for such. Egyptologists, on the other hand, with a vested interest in the status quo, continue to search for ad hoc alternative explanations to explain away the data. For my part, I plan to continue the research, gathering ever more data that bears on the age of the Great Sphinx. SR : You mentioned the Sphinx update in the Appendix to Voyages of the Pyramid Builders - in the rest of this book you take a step away from the field of geology into some of the more controversial areas of archaeology, with a focus on pyramids. Has archaeology always been a topic of interest to yourself, or is it simply an outgrowth of your work with John Anthony West on the Sphinx at Giza? Schoch : Archaeology and ancient civilizations have always been an interest of mine. I began studying ancient coins when I was twelve. I was involved in local archaeological digs in Virginia as a teenager. I used to skip classes during high school to walk a couple of blocks to the local public library and read Plato, Suetonius, Josephus, and other ancient writers. In college as an undergraduate I started with an interest in archaeology, but got sidetracked into anthropology and geology. I’ve never lost my interest in archaeology, however.

I would also comment that Newgrange and many other structures, including good true pyramids in Egypt, are today in such ruinous condition that it is easy to casually dismiss them as not pyramids but simply “mounds.” SR : Moving to another archaeological controversy that you’ve been involved with, you’ve visited the enigmatic Yonaguni underwater site off the coast of Japan a number of times. What’s your current view on the structures there - artificial or natural? Schoch : I believe that the Yonaguni structure is natural, with the slight possibility of some human use and possible subtle human mod - ification of what is primarily a natural feature. There is independent evidence of ancient human habitation on Yonaguni Island, but that is a far cry from “proving” that the so-called Yonaguni Mon - ument is an artificial human-made construct. SR : While on the topic of Yonaguni, I was bemused when the controversial Horizon documentary (which attempted to debunk Atlantis theories, and in particular the work of Graham Hancock) used your testimony about Yonaguni to discredit Hancock’s theories, but at the same time ignored your geological expertise when it came to the Sphinx argument. Did this bother you at all? Schoch : Sure it bothered me. It doesn’t quite strike SR : The book looks at the distribution of ‘pyramid cultures’ around the world, and brings up many arguments for diffusionism - especially in regards to the New World (countering the standard Bering Land Bridge theory). Have you kept up to date with the latest work by Silvia Gonzalez and do you think that this provides solid supporting evidence for your own research? Schoch : You are referring to the research by Silvia Gonzalez suggesting that at least some of the first Americans may have come from Australia (possibly via Polynesia and Japan). Based on the evidence as related in the media, I think she makes a good case. This is exciting material and I welcome her findings; yes, her work is certainly compatible with my research. More and more evidence is accumulating to support widespread transoceanic diffusion in ancient times. SR : Do you worry that including structures such as Newgrange as ‘pyramid structures’ weakens the case put forward by Voyages of the Pyramid Builders , and perhaps leaves the book open to easy - or at least superficial - attack by skeptics? Schoch : I think of it as a superficial attack by skeptics who will attack anyway. One thing I learned from the Sphinx controversy is that a certain ilk of skeptics (the “debunkers”) will attack whenever they feel their paradigms and the status quo are questioned.

The New Book: Pyramid Quest Schoch : I have met and spoken with Dr. Hawass many times, enjoying a meal and his company on more than a few occasions.

On the brink of its release we’re happy to provide the publisher’s synopsis of the new book: Pyramid Quest: Secrets of the Great Pyramid and the Dawn of Civilization by Robert M. Schoch, Ph.D. and Robert Aquinas McNally The geologist acclaimed for re-dating the Great Sphinx at Giza sets his sights on one of the true mysteries of antiquity: the Great Pyramid of Giza. What is the Great Pyramid of Giza? Ask that basic question of a traditional Egyptologist, and you receive the basic, traditional answer: A fancy tombstone for a self-important pharaoh of the Old Kingdom. This, Egyptologists argue, is the sole finding based on the data, and the only deduction supported by science. By implication, anyone who dissents from this point of view is unscientific and wooly- minded, a believer in magic and ghosts. Indeed, some of the dissenting ideas about the Great Pyramid do have a spectacularly fabulous ring to them. Yet, beneath the obvious terms of this controversy, a deeper, more significant question arises. How is it that the Great Pyramid exercises such a gripping hold on the human psyche – adding cryptic grace to the back of the dollar bill and framing myriad claims of New Age “pyramid power?” Pyramid Quest uses the rigorous intellectual analysis of scientific inquiry to investigate what we know about the Great Pyramid – and develops a stunning hypothesis: This ancient monument is the strongest proof yet that civilization began thousands of years earlier than generally thought, extending far back into a little- known, almost-forgotten time. In tracing that story, we come to understand not only the Great Pyramid itself but also our own origins as civilized beings. Read our own review of Pyramid Quest later in this issue.

On an informal basis, Dr. Hawass has never denied me access to the Sphinx enclosure. To bring in equipment and pursue formal studies, that is another matter, and not appropriate to discuss further here. I do not believe, however, that Dr. Hawass is trying to stifle research; rather, he has many considerations besides the purely scientific that he must take into account before he can approve of permits. SR : In closing - is the possibility of more recent heavy rainfall an alternative option in explaining the erosion on the Sphinx? What about the quality of the limestone? Schoch : The paleo-hydrology of the Giza Plateau has been elucidated by the work of geologist Colin Reader. We now know that the majority of water run-off, affecting the western and southern walls of the Sphinx enclosure, ended with the quarrying work that took place during the construction of the Great Pyramid, circa 2550 B.C. This means that the earliest portions of the Great Sphinx finest for building purposes, but is not of as poor quality as some writers have suggested. I believe that the oldest portions of the Sphinx must date back to pre-dynastic times, although the Sphinx was repaired and reworked (including a re-carving of the head) in dynastic times. Corroborating the pre-dynastic dating, I stand by my analysis of the subsurface weathering under the floor of the Sphinx enclosure, which by my most conservative calibrations (that is, those that would give the youngest date for the initial carving) indicate a date well prior to dynastic times. Robert Schoch in the Sphinx enclosure (photograph © Caroline Davies) must predate the Great Pyramid. Therefore the traditional dating for the Sphinx, which places it after the Great Pyramid, is wrong. The question is not whether the Great Sphinx is older than the traditional dating, but how much older. Yes, I am aware that it can still rain on the Giza Plateau, even with occasional flash floods (although quite rarely). However, in my assessment the extent and nature of the substantial surface weathering and erosion seen on the walls of the Sphinx enclosure and the body of the Sphinx is only compatible with an initial date for the quarrying of the core body of the Sphinx that is significantly older than the Fourth Dynasty.

Most of the hallucinogenic research had already been performed in the early to middle parts of the 20th century by academics. If anything, McKenna was a child of the 1960s, graduating from UC Berkeley, majoring in ecology, resource conservation and shamanism – a typical Berkeley 1960 degree that was soon abandoned by the university where some suggest a whiff of cannabis can still be sensed on campus. With his diploma in hand, McKenna set off for India and later the Amazon, where he studied the native hallucinogenic drugs used in various South American shamanic traditions. The specific Profiler THE HYPER-DIMENSIONAL AMBASSADOR W hen Terence McKenna was diagnosed with a brain tumour in May 1999, he asked the doctor whether his life of experimental drug taking might have contributed to the disease. His doctor stated that there was no evidence to say it did, but that there was suggestive evidence that cannabis might actually force brain tumours to shrink. McKenna wryly pointed out that this “suggestive evidence” must be erroneous, as otherwise he would never have developed one.

But study in the field implied student participation; rather than being caught up in the 1960s Western drug culture, here McKenna was confronted with the origins of the drug cult. Thus, at La Chorrera, at the urging of his brother Dennis, he allowed himself to be the subject of a psychedelic experiment which he claimed put him in contact with The Logos: an informative, hallucinatory voice nearly universal to the visionary experience.

But though they were scientists, they were not reporting to other academics; they were reporting to the general public about the growth, use and knowledge that these plants could teach humanity. That the Amazonian town of Iquitos is now a major centre for the “hallucinogenic tourist” is largely the result of McKenna and the following he created, with a goal to witness a native drug culture, rather than the consumerised Western equivalent of it. The drug experience in its native setting was not about pleasure; it was about knowledge acquisition. It was not about escapism; it was engaging with Nature and looking into the mirror. Terence McKenna has been described as humanity’s first ambassador to the hyper- dimensional inhabitants. That is not necessarily true – he was however the first to be sent back from that dimension with a message to the Western world, from those denizens. McKenna advocated the use of drugs, and particularly organic hallucinogens, specifically ayahuasca, which contained DMT. McKenna furthermore believed that his experiences through DMT were real and spiritually significant – they were not hallucinations; they opened a doorway into another dimension. DMT was a substance native to the brain and ayahuasca played with its normal operations, thus ‘opening the door’ for a limited period of time. It allowed the mind to enter another dimension. Once on the other side, McKenna stated that the shamanic explorer would find other forms of life in the universe. With the rising popularity of UFOs, McKenna began to preach that this phenomenon was linked with his ‘hyperspace’. The DMT experience was similar if not identical to the ‘abduction experience’, in which he believed the hyperspace creatures which he called ‘machine elves’ were seen as aliens in UFOs. It was merely the latest realisation, after their manifestation as faeries, elves or angels. McKenna mapped the history of drug usage, specifically of DMT and psilocybin, arguing that both drugs had been used throughout the ages in humanity’s effort to enter that dimension and speak with these otherworldly creatures. He believed these denizens had helped humanity throughout the ages. The extraordinary and anomalous wisdom that had often gone into ancient monuments (from the pyramids in Egypt to the equally enigmatic giant constructions in Middle and Southern America) might have been inspired and facilitated via knowledge from these denizens: giving shamans specific information on building techniques – like these denizens had given the shamans specific information on other subjects, specifically medicine.

He extrapolated from this premise towards our current society, whereby he felt that people whose life was devoid of the hallucinogenic experience were not truly ‘human’: the liberating and wisdom- receiving experience of ‘the trip’ was absent, making them more like cattle, more easy to manipulate by leaders – in short, they were not enlightened. He framed these findings in the context of various mystery traditions, which preached that through specific techniques, some of which were drug based, the initiate was ‘reborn’ as an ‘Illuminatus’, an enlightened being – someone who had seen the divine light of hyperspace. From his very first experiences, the denizens of hyperspace had given McKenna a mathematical formula which became known as ‘novelty’ and ‘Timewave Zero’. At first, McKenna had no apparent use for it. It was said to be a system that showed how ‘new things’ – novelty – would spring about in our timeline. Time itself was a fractal wave of novelty – the output from this wave. Time was thus built around a series of new ideas and paradigm shifts: events that changed the world. The problem was how to anchor the formula in our calendar – where the wave would collapse into a zero point. After some study, McKenna decided that the anchor should be on December 21, 2012 AD, which he later also identified as the end-date of the Mayan calendar. The Timewave has remained a subject of intrigue after McKenna’s death, specifically with the September 11, 1999 attacks and the December 26, 2004 Asian tsunami. McKenna argued that 2012 would be an “eschaton” – a tremendous collapse their gods, then this was not evidence of physical contact. McKenna believed that the shamans of each culture might have entered ‘hyperspace’, where they made contact with an intelligence that had been around for a long time. The various cultures, across time and space, that contacted it, would come away with the same message. His historical study included an analysis of our modern era, where ‘true drugs’ had been outlawed, but substitute drugs such as cigarettes, caffeine and sugar were widely available. McKenna found the notion of outlawing a plant absurd, and he viciously indicted the societal power structure that made possession of hallucinogens a capital crime, while peddling refined sugar to children and subsidizing tobacco and alcohol production. The latter had addictive qualities and negative health effects, whereas his drugs – specifically DMT – had never shown any addictive quality. Nevertheless, it was a Class A drug. In Food of the Gods , largely the conclusion of his historical studies, McKenna advanced the startling theory that the evolutionary track leading to the development of modern humans was sparked by the consumption of psilocybin mushrooms by cavemen. We would not have been ‘us’ without the mushroom. Specifically, he argued that psilocybin produced an enhanced visual acuity, theorising that primates who lived in areas where the mushrooms thrived, gained an evolutionary advantage in hunting. The mushrooms stimulated the verbal centres of the brain.

Though that might indeed be the purpose of the Timewave, the denizens did not anchor it in our timeline – McKenna did. Hence, the 2012 anchor is not a certitude, but only a theory. Though the Timewave does largely coincide with significant events that the Western media reports on, no scientific classification of what comprises novelty on a global scale means – nor how to time it. Did the world change at September 11, or when Bush decided to invade Afghanistan? And though it enthralled the media, was it truly a global event? And does it matter whether or not humanity does change, or merely that the event that might change humanity happens? These questions remain... McKenna was a prolific speaker: if chosen as an ambassador by the denizens of hyperspace, their choice was excellent. McKenna combined a unique voice with a specific, intriguing method of delivery, whether in public or in private. Many of his phrases were used by shamanic-inspired popular artists, from The Shamen to Eat Static and Shpongle. I had the pleasure of meeting McKenna twice and briefly corresponding with him. At our first meeting in July 1995, I was largely sceptical of the man behind the message, classifying him in a category of people who say a lot, but with little of any true value. But his public lectures and interventions, as well as private discussions, quickly revealed that McKenna was very glossy, but with a most intriguing core. He was a man of many layers; for most, he was a man prophesying the benefits of drug usage. A smaller group realised that he did not see drug usage as a recreational activity, but considered the drug user as a priest, maintaining the sacred bond between us and the Otherworld – the Logos – God. A small circle realised that by following in McKenna’s footsteps, they would be able to retrieve real knowledge from that dimension. But it seems that by 1999 McKenna was tiring from constantly travelling and his missionary work, and contemplated retiring from the public eye. Perhaps it was merely temporarily, hoping to surrender himself more to the exploration of hyperspace, rather than talking about it. Does a priest merely have to talk about God to his flock, or have private time to seek out the divine as well? On May 22, 1999, McKenna’s 52-year-old mind exploded. Non-drug induced hallucinations cut in like shards of glass; taste and smell were bent out of shape; and he was swallowed up by a labyrinth that, as he later put it, “somehow partook of last week’s dreams, next week’s fears, and a small restaurant in Dublin.” Then his blood pressure dropped and he collapsed, the victim of a brain seizure. Like John Travolta in the movie Phenomenon , McKenna had achieved a physical condition that allowed him access to another dimension – but it would also be a fatal one.

Death had never been a specific topic for McKenna. The door to hyperspace had swung so many times... But having been given a “finality”, he realised that living in the knowledge that one will die, made life rich and poignant. He said: “I could see the light of eternity, a la William Blake, shining through every leaf. I mean, a bug walking across the ground moved me to tears.” McKenna realised that given a limited amount of time focused the brain: “If most people took it seriously, a hell of a lot more would be done with more attention to quality and intent.” He had always assumed he would see 2012, but now wouldn’t. “Very few prophets live to see their prophecies – Joachim de Fiore didn’t, Marx didn’t.

My fans don’t understand any of that stuff, and my critics don’t understand much of it either. So we all just have to put up with it until it clears itself out of the way.” But at the same time, he did not want to make his death into an event, like dying on the net or entering discussions about cryogenics. “I think part of what death is about biologically is reshuffling the gene-pool. If genes were to last forever, death would never have entered the scheme of things.” Until the end, he continued to think and preach...

The Penrose-Hameroff quantum conscious - ness hypothesis proposes that quantum compu - tations in microtubules inside the brain’s neurons convert pre/sub-conscious possibilities (mani - festing as dream-like quantum information) to particular information (choices, perceptions) by a type of quantum state reduction, or collapse of the wave function. The reduction itself — an in - stantaneous event connected to the fundamental level of reality, as suggested by Penrose — is a conscious moment. A sequence of such moments gives our stream of consciousness. Quantum computation differs fundamentally from classical computation, utilizing quantum super-positions of information bits (quantum bits, or qubits, e.g. both 1 AND 0) which communicate/ interact by non-local entanglement, another strange quantum behaviour. The mechanism of reduction (conversion from quantum to classical) which produces the solution to a quantum computation is a big question — the so-called collapse of the wave function. In technological quantum computers an external measurement will cause reduction.

In the film, fourteen top scientists and mystics — including Dr Stuart Hameroff — give their take on how new research into consciousness and quantum mechanics verges on the mystical. Features THE QUANTUM MIND OF STUART HAMEROFF suggestion of self-collapse due to an objective threshold (objective reduction) is based on the idea that super-positions are separations/ curvatures in underlying space-time geometry, that these separations are unstable and will reduce to one particular curvature/separation after a specific time t . The larger the separation/ superposition, the faster it will self-collapse (and the more intense the experience). SR : Is the concept of ‘qualia’ — defined as the properties of sensory experiences which are incommunicable and only accessible by direct experience — one which provides a fundamental challenge to the physicalist worldview? Is it time that we considered ‘information’ as something as ‘real’ as the physical world? SH : I would say qualia are a challenge for physi - calism, but physicalists tend to trivialise the nature of qualia. Australian philosopher Frank Jackson’s famous ‘knowledge argument’ about Mary (the colorblind vision neuroscientist who knows everything about color vision but lacks the actual experience) frames the question well. I disagree with the physicalist answer which states that when Mary DOES gain color vision and ap - preciates qualia she has merely gained new infor - mation, or knowledge. I don’t equate qualia with information; I think that approach is a bait and switch. Interestingly, quantum information is not really information (it’s a misnomer, actual sign - aling cannot occur). Quantum information may confer qualia. Some say the universe is made of information. David Chalmers’ ‘dual aspect theory’ says that such information has both a physical aspect and an experiential (qualia) aspect. This is similar to what William James had said, and Bertrand Russell’s neutral monism, in which an underlying entity gives rise to both physical and mental qualities.

But when the metabolism driving quantum coherence (in microtubules) is lost, the quantum information leaks out to the space-time geometry in the Universe at large. Being holographic and entangled it doesn’t dissipate. Hence consciousness (or dream-like subconsciousness) can persist. SR : In your review of Christof Koch’s book The Quest for Consciousness , you say: “Consciousness occurs in dendrites, and the results are conveyed elsewhere by axonal spikes.” What exactly are you referring to as ‘consciousness’ at the dendrite level? I have this view of consciousness as being the sum creation of many individual actions/reactions at the microscopic level. So are you referring to discrete conscious experiences (e.g. dendritic reaction to sensory input), or to some other ‘action’ which amounts to an individual’s ‘total’ consciousness? Apologies for the confusing question. SH : The conventional view is that the neural correlate of consciousness is in networks of neurons connected by chemical synapses — axons to dendrites — which are serial, though you can have parallel lines of serial connections. Axonal depolarisations, or spikes, are relatively easy to record, and are robust. Therefore the view is that spikes are the currency of consciousness. However the vast majority of actual processing occurs in dendrites (numerous dendrites per neuron). Electrophysiological correlates of consciousness (e.g. gamma EEG, coherent 40 Hz) are produced by dendrites, and dendrites are interconnected by gap junctions (forming what I call hyper-neurons) which actually DO account for gamma EEG/40 Hz. John Eccles and Karl Pribram have said that consciousness occurs in dendrites. I agree, though I think dendritic webs, or hyper-neurons are the actual site. A hyper-neuron may include tens or hundreds of thousands of gap junction-connected neurons. The quantum state may extend through the gap junctions so that quantum computations in the collection of microtubules within the many dendrites of a single hyper-neuron at a particular time mediate consciousness.

I got intrigued by how the chromosomes were precisely separated by mitotic spindles — microtubules. I thought the microtubules must be processing information to account for the spatial precision. Then it was discovered that neurons were full of microtubules, so I assumed consciousness must extend downward into neuronal interiors to include microtubules. But another layer of information processing was just more computation. Someone asked — “Say you are right. How would that explain qualia?” They were right. I couldn’t. Then I read Roger Penrose’s The Emperor’s New Mind , suggesting there must be quantum mechanisms at work in consciousness, specifically objective reduction. But he lacked a structure for his quantum computing by objective reduction in the brain. I thought microtubules might be the structure he needed for his quantum computing, and his objective reduction the mechanism I needed for microtubules. We hooked up and published our model in 1994/95. We’ve been attacked ever since but are still kicking, generating testable predictions which thus far have held true. SR : Well, focusing on that for a second: as a scientist who works ‘outside’ the paradigm, do you encounter much ‘unfair’ resistance to your work? That is, some form of persecution (entirely separate to spirited and intelligent debate)? SH : Persecution is a bit harsh, but yes, the conventional wisdom proponents are more interested in protecting their turf than honestly I think psychedelic altered states are like consciousness except the boundary is pushed more into the quantum phase considering alternatives. But it’s much better to be criticised than ignored. On the other hand skepticism is good (there are a lot of whacky ideas floating around — I just think ours is not one of them). But the skeptics should be as skeptical of the conventional dogma which is extremely weak. The title of Roger’s book The Emperor’s New Mind, aimed at artificial intelligence (or maybe specifically at Marvin Minsky), was the perfect example. Roger called their bluff. Artificial Intelligence is naked, haughty and pretentious when it comes to the question of consciousness. SR : You (or your theory) recently came in for some criticism from Scientific American’s resident skeptic, Michael Shermer. In your reply to Shermer, you said: “Pre-conscious (unconscious/ subconscious) information exists as quantum super-positions — multiple coexisting possible actions or experiences — which, upon reaching a specified threshold at the moment of consciousness/self-collapse, choose a particular action or experience.” This seems to border on the mystical, with reality basically being created by particular actions and choices. Do you feel that your research sometimes bridges a gap between science and religion (or perhaps more correctly, the ‘numinous’)? SH : I’m not an idealist, like Bishop Berkeley or Hindu approaches, in which consciousness is all there is. Nor am I a Copenhagenist in which consciousness causes collapse (and chooses reality from a number of possibilities). But somewhere in between. Consciousness exists on the edge between the quantum and classical worlds. I think more like a quantum Buddhist, in that there is a universal proto-conscious mind which we access, and can influence us. But it actually exists at the funda-mental level of the universe, at the Planck scale. SR : Seeing we’re heading for the religion end of things, what about the debate over the ‘consciousness’ of other organisms (e.g. paramecium, plants, fungi, dogs, dolphins etc).

Or are we all capable? SH : Only in the brain are microtubules arranged so that a large number (e.g. in hyper-neurons) will be isolated in superposition to reach threshold in a reasonably short time. A paramecium might have a moment of consciousness every hour or so (though it would be difficult to maintain isolation for so long); we have 40 conscious moments per second. SR : You talk about the action of anesthetics in selectively erasing consciousness. Do hallucinogenic substances also act at a similar level (though not necessarily erasing consciousness)? SH : Consciousness exists on the boundary between the quantum subconscious and the classical world. I think hallucinogens promote the quantum state in their receptors (there is evidence to support that) and other proteins including microtubules. I think psychedelic altered states (and dreams) are like consciousness except the boundary is pushed more into the quantum phase — multiple coexisting possibilities, deep interconnections, distorted reality, sheaf logic, timelessness...and (for psychedelics) more conscious events per classical clock time, and more intense experience. I read with interest Michael Shermer’s skeptical criticism of the surprise hit film What the #$*! Do We Know? (Whatthebleep? to its fans) in which I appear. The film attempts to link consciousness with the weirdness of quantum mechanics. As the best candidate for such a connection, Shermer cites (then attempts to refute) a theory put forth a decade ago by British physicist Sir Roger Penrose and me. We attribute consciousness to quantum computation in structural proteins within the brain’s neurons called microtubules. Though Shermer correctly describes microtubules — part of the cell’s cytoskeleton — as scaffolding, they also actively organize intra-cellular movement, transport and neuronal synaptic plasticity (the apparent cornerstone of learning and memory). How are such activities organized? Pondering the amazing feats of unicellular protozoa which swim, avoid predators, learn, find food and mates and have sex — all without benefit of a single synapse — the famed neuroscientist Charles Sherrington surmised a half century ago “of nerve there is no trace, but the cytoskeleton might serve”.

The states of microtubule protein subunits (bits in a microtubule computer) are regulated by quantum mechanical (van der Waals London) forces in intra-protein non-polar pockets, suggesting that microtubule subunits could act not only like classical bits, but also like quantum bits (qubits) in quantum computers. To debunk our theory Shermer cites an as - sertion in a book by Victor Stenger that the prod - uct of mass, velocity and distance of a quantum system cannot exceed Planck’s constant. I’ve not seen this proposal in a peer-reviewed journal, nor listed anywhere as a serious interpretation of quantum mechanics. But in any case Stenger’s assertion is disproven by Anton Zeilinger’s ex - perimental demonstration of quantum wave behavior in fullerenes and biological porphy - rin proteins. (Skepticism should cut both ways, Mr. Shermer.) Nonetheless I agree with Stenger that synaptic chemical transmission between neurons is completely classical. The quantum computations we propose are isolated in micro - tubules within neurons. Classical neurotrans - mission provides inputs to, and outputs from, microtubule quantum computations mediating consciousness in neuronal dendrites. But the brain seems far too warm for significant quantum states, apparently running into the problem of decoherence. (Shermer conflates the strong Copenhagen interpretation of the measurement problem — that conscious observation causes wave function collapse, with decoherence — in which any exchange of energy or information with the environment erodes a quantum system.) But recent evidence shows that quantum processes in biological molecules are actually enhanced at higher temperatures. Moreover biological mechanisms within neurons (actin gelation, laser-like metabolic pumping, plasma layer shielding and topological quantum error correction in/around microtubules) may preserve quantum states in microtubules for hundreds of milliseconds or longer at brain temperature. Is there any evidence for the relevance of quantum states/processes to consciousness? Well, general anesthetic gases selectively erase consciousness while nonconscious brain activi - ties continue (e.g. evoked potentials, control of autonomic function, EEG). The anesthetic gases act in the same intra-protein non-polar pockets in which quantum London forces control protein conformation. This occurs in a class of receptors, channels and other brain proteins including cy - toskeletal structures. And the anesthetics do so by forming only quantum mechanical interac - tions, presumably interfering only with physio - logical quantum effects. It is logical to conclude that consciousness occurs in quantum pockets within proteins throughout the brain. Shermer also conflates the Copenhagen in - terpretation with the dualist quantum mind proposal of Sir John Eccles.

Rather, conscious - ness is collapse. More precisely, consciousness is a particular type of self-collapse proposed by Penrose involving quantum gravity (cur - rently being tested). Pre-conscious (uncon - scious/subconscious) information exists as quantum super-positions — multiple coexist - ing possible actions or experiences — which, upon reaching a specified threshold at the mo - ment of consciousness/self-collapse, choose a particular action or experience. Such conscious moments are calculated to occur roughly 40 times per second. Shermer closes by advising researchers to look for emergence of consciousness at the neural level and higher. This has been precisely the tack taken by armies of scientists and philosophers for decades, and the result is nil. Consciousness is ever more elusive. The prevalent paradigm — that axonal action potentials and chemical synaptic transmissions are fundamental units of computation from which consciousness emerges at a higher-order network level — force-fits consciousness into an illusory, out-of-the-loop epiphenomenon. While this might be true, the prevalent paradigm is also incompatible with the best electrophysiological correlate of consciousness — synchronized gamma EEG (“coherent 40 Hz” oscillations). The latter, it turns out, is mediated by coherent activities of neuronal dendrites linked by electrotonic gap junctions, windows which link adjacent neurons (and glia) into large-scale syncytia, or “hyper-neurons”. In 1998 I published a list of twenty testable predictions of our model (which, unlike prevalent emergence theories, is falsifiable). Several predictions have proven true (e.g. signaling and action of psychoactive drugs in microtubules). To explain the extension of quantum states among many neurons throughout the brain, I Features THE QUANTUM MIND OF STUART HAMEROFF Stuart Hameroff M.D. Professor, Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychology Director, Center for Consciousness Studies The University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona also predicted that neurons connected by gap junctions mediate consciousness, subsequently validated by gamma EEG studies.

However, it looks set to return to the limelight in 2005 with the release of Robert Schoch’s latest book, Pyramid Quest (co-authored with Robert Aquinas McNally). The blurb reads: Pyramid Quest uses the rigorous intellectual analy - sis of scientific inquiry to investigate what we know about the Great Pyramid – and develops a stunning hypothesis: This ancient monument is the strongest proof yet that civilization began thousands of years earlier than generally thought, extending far back into a little-known, almost-forgotten time. The book begins with a recap of Schoch’s introduc - tion to the Giza Plateau, via John West and the age of the Sphinx controversy. This chapter illustrates the difficulty in catering to two audiences – one which is quite familiar with the story, and the newcom - ers who need an introduction. It serves its purpose well, moving along at a brisk pace while filling in the necessary blanks. Schoch and McNally then move on to outlin - ing the orthodox view of Egypt’s early history, with a particular focus on the development of monu - mental building. This history includes interesting sidenotes, such as Schoch’s personal opinion that the anomalous shape of the Bent Pyramid was a purposeful design from the outset, and the revela - tion that the Great Pyramid exhibits solar lighting effects during important seasonal events. We are then treated (or is that subjected?) to a discussion of the various unorthodox theories concerning the Great Pyramid – from power plant to water pump, Cayce to Hoagland. Each is treated fairly – Schoch and McNally explore each idea with open-mindedness, but ultimately are skeptical on the basis of quite solid evidence. This analysis provides one of the key learning experiences in the book – that throughout the ages, humanity has imposed their own meanings upon the Great Pyramid. This is summed up succinctly later in the book: “Working less with a microscope than a mirror, various thinkers, writers and philos - Pyramid Quest: This history includes interesting sidenotes, such as Schoch’s personal opinion that the anomalous shape of the Bent Pyramid was a purposeful design from the outset Robert Schoch and Robert Aquinas McNally"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Reviews Sub Rosa | June 2005 41 Buy from Amazon U K: Buy from Amazon U S: ophers have attached their ideas to Ancient Egypt and the pyramids.” Pyramid Quest agrees with the orthodox view of the construction capabilities of the Egyptian civi - lisation. Schoch provides evidence to show that it was well within their ability to build a monument even as grandiose as the Great Pyramid. He also squashes Sitchin’s “Vyse Forgery” claim for the Khufu quarry marks, although he remains open- minded to the possibility that the 4th Dynasty Khufu may have been named after a more ancient personage: It is apparent that building the Great Pyramid didn’t require helicopters, levitation, extraterres - trial help, or divine intervention...but answering the question...does not necessarily mean it was done during the time of Khufu or even during the Old Kingdom. This statement is the fulcrum upon which Pyramid Quest pivots – from an agreement with the ortho - doxy and a dismissal of most alternative theories, the authors then present their own alternative case: that “Giza isn’t the birth of something new...it is instead the full flower of something old.” Relying heavily on the contentious geometric and astro - nomical analyses of Livio Stecchini and Thomas Brophy (respectively), Schoch and McNally go on to outline their hypothesis that Giza has astronomi - cal and initiatory roots which reach back deep into pre-history. While the ideas are fascinating and a worthy read, I do have my reservations. It would have been far more appealing if the book had skipped the chapters devoted to madcap pyramid theories, and instead provided far more detail on both Fred Wendorf’s team’s astronomical analysis of the truly ancient Nabta Playa site, as well as Colin Reader’s excellent geological investigation into the pre-4th Dynasty attributes of the Giza Plateau. Both serve as serious support for the book’s thesis. Brophy’s claims, on the other hand, need to be published and debated properly before being given the absolute credence they are in Pyramid Quest (for example, the authors write – without batting an eyelid – that “the builders of the Great Pyramid were still keep - ing track of the galactic centre millennia later, and by means of the shafts emanating from the King’s and Queen’s Chamber”). Also, where is Schoch? When he begins discuss - ing his own geological opinion on pyramid struc - tures, such as his dismissal of the geopolymer theo - ry of how the Great Pyramid was built, it makes for fascinating and educational reading (as does his opinion of the Face on Mars). Instead, throughout much of the book he serves up other’s opinions – a real lost opportunity in my eyes. It also has to be asked: what happened to the thesis of Voyages of the Pyramid Builders ? This is certainly no sequel, as both the major threads of that book – diffusionism and catastrophism – are not addressed in Pyramid Quest , and the construc - tion of the Great Pyramid is not linked to either of those ideas. It seems a strange follow-up, consid - ering the interest generated within the alternative community by the previous book. The (voluminous) appendices add to the value of the book, with numerous sub-threads of pyramid history, speculation and measurement available for the curious reader. One wonders how much could have been worked into the more logical progression of the book itself though, to help give more context and meaning to the quite diverse amount of mate - rial provided. All in all, Pyramid Quest is written well and provides a good grounding in both the orthodox and alternative views of the Great Pyramid. Those new to the subject will find much of interest in the book (although they could also invest in Giza: The Truth by Ogilvie-Herald and Lawton, and Secret Chamber by Robert Bauval for a comprehensive overview of the history of Giza). However, I think more informed readers will be disappointed that the book does not go into more detail on the already-established evidence supporting alternative theories, and that Schoch himself doesn’t play a more key role in this. This is the difference between Pyramid Quest being a ‘popular read’ on the subject, or one that will challenge the status quo in any way – and I feel that is a missed opportunity."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"June 2005 | Sub Rosa 42 Reviews R obert Schoch must be a masochist. For more than a decade, Schoch has put his professional reputation on the line by bravely claiming that erosion on the Sphinx at Giza points to an earlier construction than officially recognised. For his intellectual cu - riosity, the Boston University geologist has been pilloried by orthodox academia - though in the intervening years no truly impartial investiga - tion has been launched to settle the issue, despite the extraordinary implications of his claims. Not content to be the arch-enemy of Egyp - tologists, Schoch has now written a book titled Voyages of the Pyramid Builders, an investigation of ‘pyramid cultures’ around the world which examines whether they had a common source. It’s like Schoch thought swimming with sharks wasn’t exciting enough, so he decided to throw some blood in the water as well. Because behind the idea of a primary pyramid-building culture lies one of the dirtiest words in all of academic archaeology: hyper-diffusionism. And walking hand-in-hand with that word is another, even worse: Atlantis. That’s not to say that Schoch is talking At - lantis in this book. But the shadow of Ignatius Donnelly looms large whenever the subject of hyper-diffusionism is raised. In his massively influential Atlantis: The Antediluvian World , Donnelly put forth his thoughts on world-wide cultural similarities: I cannot believe that the greatest inventions were duplicated spontaneously...in different countries. Donnelly displayed immense erudition and depth of learning, but little in the way of critical thinking. His careless linkage of disparate themes was largely responsible for the massive amount of literature on the subject of Atlantis - most of it worthless.

Voyages of the Pyramid Builders begins at Schoch’s ‘home base’, the pyra - mid (and Sphinx) plateau at Giza in Egypt. From there, Schoch and his co-author Robert Aquinas McNally proceed to survey pyramid-building cultures through history and across the globe. Readers new to the subject, who may only be fa - miliar with the Egyptian pyramids, will find this brief summary of great interest, considering the global spread of cultures mentioned. In this section we also unfortunately find some of the weaker arguments in the book, and I can only assume critics will take delight in de - constructing some of it. For instance, Schoch in - cludes structures such as Newgrange in Ireland as indicative of a pyramid-building culture...I’m afraid I find my own house looks more like a pyr - amid than Newgrange does. However, there are at least reasons given for the selection of New - grange, and it should also be noted that Schoch includes it in a section titled ‘Pyramids or Not?’, indicating that this is more speculation than fact. Nevertheless, it leaves the rest of this fascinating book open to critical panning due to the seeming absurdity of this particular claim, at least at face value, for the casual reader. The following chapter surveys the mythical foundations of pyramid building, and the strangely similar concepts across the globe. Schoch notes the astronomical component via cardinal and stellar alignments, as well as the preservation of interred bodies via mummification. The practice of ritual sacrifice is also mentioned as a commonality between many pyramid constructions. Chapters four to six then change tack away from the central subject of pyramids, and inves - tigate the peopling of the New World. Chapter four presents the current anthropological data on the entrance of humans into the Americas, as well as introducing the idea that other contacts were made in the intervening years between the original migration and the arrival of Columbus. The subsequent two chapters then delve into the heretical idea of trans-oceanic influence in detail, the first discussing possible contacts across the Atlantic, and the second across the Pacific. Readers are likely to find these two chap - ters extremely interesting. Schoch and McNally present up-to-date information on the latest re - search in a multitude of disciplines pointing at trans-oceanic contacts, including biological (e.g. intestinal parasites), archaeological (Old World-style copper tools) and anthropological (blow-pipes). Much of this will be new to most readers, and is perhaps the core of the book for the more experienced reader on diffusionism. My only caution might be one I’ve learnt from personal research - that diffusionism is not the only mechanism for cultural similarities and archetypes...others being areas such as astron - omy and the Jung’s speculative idea of a ‘col - lective unconscious’. But most of the evidence cited here is rock solid, and surely challenges the current paradigm. Interestingly, these chapters seem to pivot the book away from its apparent focus - the pyr - amid-building culture - and towards a more gen - eral summary of diffusionism and the cause for migrations. As mentioned above, there are three chapters which deal with journeys to the New World, which are followed by a chapter on how (transport and navigation) these people may have traveled, and then two chapters on cata - strophism and the possibility that cometary im - pacts have had a major influence on the (relative - ly) recent history of Homo sapiens.

To do that, more at - tention must be given to linking building and architectural techniques, and direct ‘pyramidal’ influences between cultures rather than simply broad evidence for cultural diffusion. Also, the link to Sundaland deserves far more attention, as without more evidence it is more a ‘possible’ than a probable’.

For those yet to be introduced to the Darko world, the movie follows a strange sequence of events which begin with Donnie Darko (Jake Gyl - lenhaal) encountering a man-sized rabbit named Frank, who tells him how much time is left until the world will end - and it’s not long. Is Frank a figment of Donnie’s troubled imagination, is he a spirit guide, or something else altogether? These are the questions which you will be asking yourself even after you walk away from this movie. To de - scribe much more of the plot would be to spoil the experience - it’s a worthwhile (if confusing) jour - ney to take with a fresh brain, ripe for warping. This new Director’s Cut does offer some further explanation via the inclusion of formerly deleted scenes. Kelly also offers the viewer some excerpts from the book that Donnie finds in the film - The Philosophy of Time Travel - which give handy clues as to what is happening as the movie progresses. Nevertheless, you’ll still probably need multiple viewings, or a trip to the movie’s official website, to help fill in the majority of the blanks (though some will remain). Also included is the ubiquitous commentary from Richard Kelly and good friend Kevin Smith ( Clerks ). It’s always great to hear the director com - menting on the movie (so often left to an actor or producer), to really get a feel for the production of the movie and how their particular vision evolved. And the vision shown by Kelly on Donnie Darko is superb, from a beautifully sequenced introduction to the main characters at the school, to Donnie’s menacing interludes with Frank the bunny. The Director’s Cut also changes some of the backing soundtrack, which can be a little off- putting for the serious Darko fan as the musical se - lection of 1980s music was crucial to the vibe of the movie. The original version of the movie featured the opening audio of “Killing Moon” by Echo & The Bunnymen, which set the tone for the movie perfectly (to my ears anyhow). However, in the Director’s Cut Kelly has replaced this track with “Never Tear Us Apart” by INXS. Thankfully, Gary Jules rendition of “Mad World” remains with its visual collage as in the original release, as this is probably one of the most exquisite audio-visual combinations I’ve had the pleasure to experience in a movie. A second DVD features a production diary, with B-roll footage of the movie-making process and an optional commentary as well. A storyboard to screen featurette also gives a good insight into how the original vision translated to the screen. Docu - mentaries on the Donnie Darko fan base included on this disk were not as appealing to me, although there are a few laughs to be had via “#1 fan” Darryl Donaldson’s piece (don’t be fooled folks!). There’s little to dislike about the new package, and for the serious collector of movies the Direc - tor’s Cut always offers a little more prestige than the original - although in this case original fans might like to stick with the original experience. As a fan of the movie myself, it’s a welcome ad - dition to my collection. I’m always up for a bit of brain-bending though, so disregard my review if you like your movie experience to be simple and sugary. However, for the discerning movie viewer with esoteric leanings, this is a great purchase.

Titled Supernatural , the new tome is said to investigate the “greatest riddle of human history” – the sudden development, some 50,000 years ago, of the qualities which make us human, such as religion, sophisticated symbol - ism, and innovative thinking. Hancock’s quest takes him on a journey of ad - venture and detection from the stunningly beauti - ful painted caves of prehistoric France, Spain and Italy to remote rock shelters in the mountains of South Africa where he finds a treasure trove of ex - traordinary Stone Age art. The clues lead him to travel to the depths of the Amazon rainforest to drink the powerful plant hallucinogen Ayahuasca with Indian shamans, whose paintings contain images of ‘supernatural S teven Spielberg returns to one of his fa - vourite subjects with the upcoming War of the Worlds . Spielberg, the director of E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind , says that while his inner self prefers movies about benevolent aliens, “the audience in me wants to make War of the Worlds . For sheer excitement, nothing comes close to warfare between the hu - man race and an extraterrestrial one. It’s bigger than life.” The movie, which took only 10 months to make (and just 72 days to shoot), stars Tom Cruise and will open on June 29. Likely to be the sum - mer blockbuster, the movie is the third major ad - aptation of the 1898 H. G.

Scientists at the cutting edge of consciousness research have begun to consider the possibility that such hallucinations may be real perceptions of other ‘dimensions’.

Could it be that human evo - lution is not just the ‘blind’, ‘meaningless’ process that Darwin identified, but something else, more purposive and intelligent, that we have barely even begun to understand?

I have delved in the bones of Mother Earth, And tended goats on hillsides. I have been poor more often than not, And happy, by and by. I will flow into the sea one day, Yet still I have my source. My home is Caledon of old, Beyond the wall of turf and tree, Raised in folly by a Latin hand. What need for temples and icons of gold? We have the hills and sheltered glens, The crags whose weathered faces, Have glowered in the mists, Ere your paltry lands rose from the waves. I have been an otter playing in a burn, And a kestrel on the wing. I have been a wolf howling to the gale, And a hermit in a hidden cave. I have sang the song more often than not, And died, by and by. I will flow into the sea one day, Yet still I sing my source. My home is a hut of wood and thatch: You might sneer at this hovel, But you would not dare. My wife, of royal blood and true, Would slit you ear to ear, Before you finished. We value manners highly here. Care not a whit for snide politeness. I have been a single leaf, On a mighty rowan tree. I have been a single stalk of wheat, And the scythe which cut it down. I have known my name more often than not, And cried, by and by. I will flow into the sea one day, Remembering my source. We are a gracious people, Who save our insults for battle, Or for true friends over ale. Cross us at your peril, As the ghosts of old invaders will tell. The day they sent the Legion North, Was a time for singing songs, And whetting blades. I have been a mist upon the mountains, And a winter wind through trees. I have been a snowflake on the hearthstone, And the sunlight on a window pane. I have loved more often than not, And lost love, by and by. I will flow into the sea one day, A long journey from my source. I have been a sword that broke in battle, And a child born a King. I have been a single word, And the thief who took your gold away. I have learned more often than not, And tried, by and by. I will flow into the sea one day, To join, at last, my source.
