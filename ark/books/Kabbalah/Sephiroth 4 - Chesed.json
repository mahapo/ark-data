The previous Sephiroths were unobtainable by the human existance. Chesed as imbodied b y the symbol of Zeus or Jupiter is the King of the Gods we know. This energy is acutally the begining of organisation, Law and Order in our rational universe. Chesed is the energy of intelligence, the first time we can comprehend the Sephiroths at all. Before this level we would go mad trying to take on the spiritual energy of the Supernal Triangle of Kether , Chokmah and Binah . Actually there is no path from the 3rd to the 4th Sephiroths showing the break from the higher energies to the lower ones we can understand more completely. The only path available from Chesed is back to Chokmah the first Male energy in the Supernal Triangle . The other paths from Chesed are down to Netzach across to Geburah and diagonally to Tiphareth . This is the begining of the Gr eat Central Wheel of the Tree of Life, where all the Gods of the Ages dwell. This wheel traces the \"Star of David\" and is a very powerful Symbol. The missing top six point would be the hidden Sephiroth of \"Daath\" not shown on the Tree of Life. The bottom point is that of Yesod and the four remaining points you can find for yourself as they surround Tiphareth . So Chesed represents the first taste we have of the energy of the Tree of Life as it decends.To get to this level we would actually have to travel from the base at Malkuth the 10th Sephiroth all way up the Tree to this the 4th energy. The Way can be traced using the paths between the Sephrioths (remember they are represented by the major arcana of the Tarot cards) The accepted way of energy flow from Malkuth to Chesed is via Path 32 (The Fool) through Yesod then Path 30 (Judgement) via Hod through path 27 (Star) Pa g e 1 of 3 Qabalah - Chese d 4/14/2002 htt p ://www.beachaccess.com.au/mer lins/Qabalah/Chesed.html"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Move to the next Sephiroth passing Netzach via path 24 (Temperance) ente ring the centre of the Tree at Tiphareth then onto path 22 (Hanged Man) turning at Geburah and finally taking path 19 (Hermit) to end at Chesed . This is an accepted way of the Adepet, alth ough you can trace your own paths and move through the enregies anyway you choose, this is the way of the human student of The Tree of Life. An interesting path is that of the Messiah, which is a spiritual rising only up the central pillar of the Tree of Life. From Malkuth up path 22 (Fool) through Yesod again but now via path 25 (Devil) to Tiphareth then up path 13 (Empress) to get to Kether . If you examine this c hoice it is one of first blind faith (Fool) then very extreme temptations (Devil) then finally elightenment (Empress). A very difficult way and a choi ce not to attempted by those weak of faith in themselves or their God. Actually many take the 25th path (Devil) selfishly wanting the power of Tiphareth with destructive results and eventual madness. Those that try this path and return have a long hard road to return to the natural Way and mo ve up the accepted paths of the Adept. But they still can attempt th e climb again and have the knowleadge and experience to possibly hold to the way this time.
