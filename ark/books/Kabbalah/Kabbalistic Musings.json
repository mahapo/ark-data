I wish to express my gratitude to Professor David Biale, who first approached me about preparing these lectures, and to Professor Daniel Boyarin, who followed up by extending an o‹cial invi- tation on behalf of the Program in Jewish Studies at Berkeley. The time I spent on the Berkeley campus was a turning point on my journey, both personally and professionally. The goal of my lectures was to illumine the nexus of time, truth, and death elicited from the symbolic imaginary of the Jewish esoteric tradition known by both practitioners and scholars as kabbalah. The inspiration and framework for my exploration, however, was the rabbinic teaching that the word emet, “truth,” comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet: alef, mem, and tau. 1 These letters serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time: past, present, and future. Accordingly, I dedicated each of the three lec- tures to one of these letters, with the aim of elucidating the corresponding aspect of temporality. In revising the lectures for publication, I have added two introductory chapters. The first outlines the philosophical sources that have shaped my own hermeneutical understanding of time, which, invariably, entails a temporal understanding of hermeneutics. The second offers a concep- tion of temporality, culled from a wide range of kabbalistic texts, that serves as the backdrop for the specific analyses in the three chapters on alef /past, mem /present, and tau /future. I drew the material for my textual reasoning in the lectures almost exclusively xi Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page xi"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"from two anthologies that can be viewed as the bookends of the earliest period of kabbalistic literary activity, the twelfth to the thirteenth centuries: Sefer ha-Bahir and Sefer ha-Zohar, the former also transmitted as Midrash Rabbi Ne h uniah ben ha-Qanah and the latter as Midrash Rabbi Simeon ben Yo h ai. The choice of these pseudepigraphic texts—here I bracket the complex question of multiple layers of composition and redaction discernible in the literary landscape of both works, though it should be clear to the reader that I presume in neither case the existence of an “original” text that may be recovered or reconstructed by the canons of critical scholarship—is deliberate: the midrashic disposition exhibited in the bahiric parables and zoharic homilies provides a particularly useful prism through which to consider a narratological conception of temporality that defies the doc- trinaire distinction between truth and appearance, reality and imagination. To elucidate this point fully I mention a comment made by Theodor Adorno in a letter written April 19, 1939, to Gershom Scholem, thanking him for send- ing a copy of Die Geheimnisse der Tora (1936) . Adorno said of Scholem’s translation of a zoharic passage in this work: “The extract you have translated is an inter- pretation of the history of creation as a ‘symbol.’ However, the language into which the symbol is translated is itself a symbolic language, which calls to mind Kafka’s statement that all his works were symbolic, but only in the sense that they were to be interpreted by new symbols in an endless series of steps.” 2 Adorno correctly understood that in presuming the parabolic nature of truth— an orientation that resonates with the symbolic imaginary proffered by medie- val kabbalists—Kafka closed the gap separating fact and fiction and thereby opened the horizon of textuality to the measure of incommensurability, the limitless limit that delimits the interpretative standpoint from which a reader may summon a hermeneutical criterion of objectivity that avoids the extremes of absolute relativism, on the one hand, and relative absolutism, on the other. Critical to abiding in the sway of this stance is the discernment that language, poetically conceived as inherently metaphorical, is always a gesture of transla- tion, a joining of disparate sign-codes rather than a harnessing of similar ones. 3 In the particular cultural ambiance of medieval kabbalah, language performs this function by expressing the inexpressible, rendering the invisible visible. The symbol, therefore, brings the unknown into relation with the known, but with- out reducing the difference that binds the two incongruities into a selfsame identity. 4 The obfuscation between story and event displayed in Sefer ha-Bahir, and even more extremely in Sefer ha-Zohar, represents an embellishment of the rabbinic parable to the point that one can no longer distinguish between signifier and signified, mashal and nimshal. 5 In the kabbalistic mind-set, there is no gap between signifier and signified, for every nimshal becomes a mashal vis-à-vis Preface xii Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page xii"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"another nimshal, which quickly turns into another mashal, and so on ad infinitum in an endless string of signifiers that winds its way finally (as a hypothetical con- struct rather than a chronological occurrence) to the in/significant, which may be viewed either as the signified to which no signifier can be a‹xed or the sig- nifier to which no signified can be assigned. To those familiar with post- modernist theory, such a blurring of the distinction between mashal and nimshal will resonate with the challenge to the modernist faith in epistemological cer- tainty based on fixed meaning and identifiable essences. In semiotic terms, one can meaningfully posit that speech (the linguistic gesture expressed as the ver- bal gesticulation, graphic inscription, or mental avowal of word-signs) has a terminus, but semiosis (the interpretation of those signs) is infinite. The impos- sibility of presence—the rallying call of postmodern hermeneutics—is insepa- rable from the impossibility of absence inasmuch as there can be no presence but in the presence of absence, just as there can be no absence but in the absence of presence. 6 The notion of the inherently symbolic nature of language, and the further assumption regarding the linguistic nature of reality, raise the possibil- ity of a hermeneutic buttressed by an alternative conception of temporality, one not necessarily privileging a linear conception of time that imposes upon the researcher the historicist presumption that a cultural phenomenon is best apprehended by viewing its historical context synchronically. In the third chapter in this book, the first of the lectures, I explore the para- dox of beginning: to begin, the beginning would have had to begin to be the beginning it is to be, but if this is so, then it would not be the beginning it must be if it is the beginning of what it is to be. The mystery of doubling is encoded semiotically in the opening letter of the first verse of the genesis narrative that begins Torah, beit, the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet, the cipher for number two. Beginning is symbolized by beit, but before beit is alef, the mystery, pele, 7 that points to the origin that precedes the beginning. The first, which is the head, is shrouded in the veil of the second, the twofold nature of secrecy that lies at the time-root; the two come to fruition by the third letter, gimmel, the bridge that connects alef and beit and thus makes possible the bestowing of the gift, the overflow of divine effulgence from the phallic potency to the vaginal vessel, mythicized as the son connecting father and daughter, the upper and lower manifestations of wisdom. In the fourth chapter, the second of the three lectures, I turn my attention to the letter mem, the thirteenth of the twenty-two letters, situated, according to the rabbinic dictum briefly mentioned above, in the middle of the alphabet. By focusing on the letter that signifies the middle, one is, needless to say, well placed to reflect philosophically on the nature of the middle. Like the begin- ning, the middle exemplifies the character of doubling, for to speak of the mid- Preface xiii Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page xiii"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"dle one must be muddled in the middle, that is, one speaks of the middle only from the standpoint of the middle. In this respect, meditation on the mem affords us a model of repetition with difference, the eschatological mirroring of creation, moving from beginning’s end to end’s beginning, returning from middle to middle. In the fifth chapter, the last of the lectures, I investigate the letter tau, the final letter in the alef-beit and thus the obvious demarcation of the terminus, manifest on the temporal plane with the in/temporal experience of death—if one can speak of death as experienced. The letter assumes as well the character of the seal of the word for truth, h otamo shel emet, the “signet of truth.” This double function of tau opens a path that illumines the juxtaposition of truth and death, which underscores that truth is most fully disclosed in the inevitable eventuality of the singular (non)event of death — the moment that is always never the same. In/through death, one discerns that change and permanence are not antinomi- cal; quite to the contrary, the time of death beckons the death of time, viewed through setting permanence and annihilation at opposite ends of a spectrum; in the death of time is not the time of death but an awakening to the chronic truth that what persists is what changes, what changes is what persists. 8 In the space- time world of differentiation, dichotomies are posited pragmatically to allow a natural order: light followed by dark, left opposite right, above distinguished from below, within differentiated from without. In death, however, the truth of the world of unity is disclosed—a truth predicated on discerning the coinci- dence of opposites, that is, the mystical insight that in ultimate reality opposites are no longer distinguishable, for they are identical in virtue of being opposite. Death allows truth in its ultimate (non)appearance to be seen, the other com- prising its other as the same other that is other to the same, untruth rooted in the very heart of truth. It is precisely from this identity of difference that one may glimpse the difference of identity, the weave of time’s being becoming the becoming of time’s being, each moment ephemerally enduring, the past per- sistently approaching the present of its future passing. 9 The ruminations on time contained in this book well forth from the dilemma, acknowledged by many who have walked this path before me, that it does not seem possible to experience external events and objects temporally unless we presuppose an inner sense of time, but if we presume the latter, we cannot be confident that we are experiencing the former—temporal objects can be constituted for consciousness only because consciousness comports itself temporally. How can consciousness constituted by time, and thus always in flux, account for the persistence of intentional contents of consciousness as identifiable subjects of experience? Edmund Husserl, who dedicated so much of his life to pondering the human experience of time, ably captured the wider Preface xiv Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page xiv"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"issue underlying this puzzle when he wondered in his Amsterdam lectures of 1926 if we can “overcome the paradox of our doubling [Verdoppelung]. ... We are fated as human beings to be the psychophysical subjects of a mental life in the real world and, at the same time, transcendentally to be subjects of a tran- scendental, world-constituting life-process.” 10 As the following citation from Barry Dainton illustrates, even contemporary physicists, utilizing a different methodology, have been forced by the dint of their speculations to acknowl- edge the inherent di‹culty in thinking about time that Husserl formulated so well: “Immanent flow is such a pervasive feature of our consciousness that it is hard to think of anything that does not possess this feature, time included, for not only do our thoughts possess it as we think them, but so do any mental images that we call up.” 11 The supposedly distinctive capacity of human beings to live in this state of “doubling” as immanent and transcendent subjectivities is facil- itated by the “transcendental power of imagination”—in Martin Heidegger’s locution, a “spontaneous receptivity and receptive spontaneity,” 12 a metamor- phic power that unsettles binary oppositions, rendering the real unreal, the concrete abstract, the somatic symbolic. “To render Time sensible,” wrote Gilles Deleuze, “in itself is a task common to the painter, the musician, and sometimes the writer. It is a task beyond all measure or cadence.” 13 The time of which Deleuze speaks is not “time as Chronos,” that is, time measured in accord with the repetition of events, but “time as Aion,” 14 that is, the “form of empty time” that fractures the “I” and dissolves the self, 15 the “demented time” that is “out of joint,” the event of difference that ruptures chronology, the discontinuous duration of the continuous present, 16 the immeasurable time of the force of becoming, the “pure immanence” of the indeterminate life 17 that for all time remains predictably unpredictable. 18 Hopefully, the path I set forth with the words that follow will make something of the phenomenon sensible and thus lead the steps of another to the place of temporal doubling, the middle wherein beginnings end and endings begin.

Is to-day nothing? Is the beginningless past nothing? If the future is nothing they are just as surely nothing. Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass (Un)doing Time in Time Un(doing) In my time, many a time, I have heard myself and others speak of a lifetime. This compound dis/plays the juxtaposition of life and time so elemental to our way of being in the world: what most impresses our thinking about the life-that-is- passing is the passing-that-is-life, a passing that lies at the root of our rootless- ness. We are perpetually cast in the mold of temporal beings, always, it seems, being in time for the time being. Time flies, runs, flees, passes too quickly, too slowly, and yet at the end of day—invariably the beginning of night—the question persists: where did the time go? The seemingly trite wording of the query should not be overlooked: the emphasis is on time’s going, that is, one attempts to take hold of the passage of time. From the philosophical position known as temporal realism, and according to the somewhat more sophisticated theory of four-dimensionalism — the hypothesis that material reality consists of spatial and temporal parts, that objects persist in spacetime through the manifold combinations of perdurance, endurance, presentism, and eternalism 1 — it is the “progress of events, the com- ing to pass of one thing after another, and not just a timeless tapestry” that grounds the distinction between past, present, and future and thereby accords legitimacy to the proposition that time is real. 2 Stated less technically, the sign- posts that mark one’s entry into and departure from the world are temporal in their comportment, birth at one end, death at the other. Nothing, it would 1 1 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 1"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"seem, is more basic to the scripting of the egological narrative—the I “am” of what “is” 3 — than the time it takes one to die, an insight familiar to the philo- sophically attuned from Heidegger’s infamous notion of Sein zum Tode, being- unto-death — the (not)being that is(not), present all too pervasively in its absence. 4 Interestingly enough, this philosophic discernment, often considered elitist and removed from mundane social reality, is supported by archaeological and ethnological evidence from the dawn of human culture indicating that Paleo- lithic humans were acutely aware of the temporal nature of existence. Anthro- pologists have even argued that the ability to view time in its twofold dimen- sion, the present as an outcome of the past and as a platform for the future, is one of the principal ways in which Homo sapiens is distinguished as a distinct species of primate. 5 Even in preliterate societies the preoccupation with tempo- rality—specifically, the quest to commemorate time and thereby overcome the ravaging aspect of mortality—was concretized in rituals that celebrated birth and death as the bookends of life’s journey. Although these rites might seem “primitive” to the critical eye, ideationally they were no less sophisticated than the most convoluted postmodern discourse that depicts human temporality as caught between recollection of the beginning anticipating the end and antici- pation of the beginning recollecting the end. Robert Lauer, a sociologist by training, astutely observed: Indeed, if one were to write a history of concern with the temporal, one would find oneself compelled to probe into the primordial consciousness. Even at the most primitive level of human life, we have evidence of human awareness of and concern with temporality. . . . In the mythical consciousness of the archaic human, there was an inner sense, an intuitive grasping, of the temporality of life .... Human awareness of and concern with temporality is particularly evident in our unique concern for the dead — a distinctively human trait that has apparently characterized all people in all places and in all times. 6 Besides maintaining a concern with temporality from time immemorial, humans have also been compelled to inquire about the nature of time. What sense of time is conveyed when one speaks of a lifetime? No sooner spoken that another question suggests itself: How does one distinguish the time of telling from the telling of time? To discourse about time is to be caught in a circle: one cannot speak of the being of time except from the standpoint of the time of being, nor of the time of being except from the standpoint of the being of time. As Julia Kristeva noted in her exposition of “the experience of time embodied” (l’expérience du temps incorporé) in the thought of Marcel Proust, “Whether we are lost Chapter One 2 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 2"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"in time, losing time, or losing our lives without discovering anything in death, we are made of the same substance as time because it defines the boundaries of our speech. Speaking about time while time passes is a problem that circles in on itself, producing a painful cyclical motion in which the problem disappears in order to attain a rapture beyond words—and beyond time.” 7 In the effort to discern time the mind comes to the rim of reason, the limit of language. Aristotle, it will be recalled, lucidly laid out some of the paradoxes that arise when one attempts to account for time—paradoxes that, according to Simplicius, the sixth-century Neoplatonist, were not successfully resolved by either Aristotle or his expositors. 8 Many centuries later, in Die Grundprobleme der Phänomenologie, the text of a lecture course delivered at the University of Marburg in the summer of 1927, Martin Heidegger offered the following assessment: “No attempt to get behind the riddle of time can permit itself to dispense with coming to grips with Aristotle. For he expressed in clear conceptual form, for the first time and for a long time after, the common understanding of time, so that his view of time corresponds to the natural concept of time.” 9 The first of Aristotle’s paradoxes renders the very existence of time impossi- ble, since something whose parts do not exist cannot itself exist—and in the case of time, its parts do not exist. The past is no longer, the future is not yet, and the present cannot be considered part of a larger whole, for, in the absence of past and future, time is dimensionless, an instant with no measurable dura- tion and consequently erased from the imprint of memory in a flash, (be)com- ing in passing. The second paradox deals with the impossibility of determining whether the present, ostensibly the bridge that links past and future, is always the same or always different. If the former, there would be no way to establish simultaneity so one could discern a pattern in the unfolding of temporal events; if the latter, there would of necessity be absolute simultaneity, the coincidence or “compresence” of all moments in the present, and hence “nothing would be before or after anything else.” 10 Plotinus began his treatise on eternity and time on a similar note, remarking that “we think that we have a clear and distinct experience of them in our own souls, as we are always speaking of them and using their names on every occasion. Of course, when we try to concentrate on them and, so to speak, to get close to them, we find again that our thought runs into di‹culties.” 11 But surely the most celebrated passage enunciating the dilemma of determining the nature of time appears in the Confessions of Augustine: “What is time? Who can explain this easily and briefly? Who can comprehend this even in thought so as to articulate the answer in words? Yet what do we speak of, in our familiar everyday conversation, more than of time? We surely know what we mean when we speak of it. We also know what is meant when we hear someone else talking about it. When then is time?

If I want to explain it to an inquirer, I do not know.” 12 To articulate the character of time is to freeze the river in motion, but the river thus frozen is not the river one set out to freeze. In the history of Western philosophy, Zeno’s well-known paradoxes are based on the assumption that movement as such cannot be comprehended without contradiction. 13 Extending this point to the issue of time more generally—an extension justified by the seemingly inextricable link between motion and temporality—it is impossible to delineate in word or concept what is constantly on the way to not being what it has become. In Augustine’s own words, “At the moment when time is pass- ing, it can be perceived and measured. But when it has passed and is not pres- ent, it cannot be.” 14 To (be)hold the time of flux, one would have to stop the flux of time, but if one were to stop the flux of time, there would no longer be a time of flux to be(hold). The conventional triadic division of time offers the illusion of a temporal trajectory traversing through one fixed point to the next in a linear pattern, but the experience of the flowing currents of time, swerving this way and that way, cannot be accounted for on the basis of spatially-con- ceived instants, momentary units that are measurable, decipherable, commin- gled yet discrete. As Simplicius put it, “As to what time may be, then, to this question hardly the wisest would be able to find an answer.” 15 In the course of the passage of much time, the same sentiment has been expressed by many of the finest philosophical minds. To mention two examples from the twentieth century, Alfred North Whitehead wrote: “It is impossible to meditate on time and the mystery of the creative passage of nature without overwhelming emotion at the limitations of human knowledge.” 16 Heidegger, too, observed: “Although we constantly reckon with time or take account of it without explicitly measuring it by the clock and are abandoned to it as the most commonplace thing, whether we are lost in it or pressed by it—although time is as familiar to us as only something in our Dasein can be, nevertheless, it becomes strange and puzzling when we try to make it clear to ourselves even if only within the limits of everyday intelligibility.” 17 Heidegger, however, provides a method to deal with the aporia, a path to cut through the ostensible obstruction of having no path: “What we need first of all is a many-sided orientation toward the time phenomenon, following the clue of the traditional time concepts. After that it becomes pertinent to inquire in what way the interpretations of time from which these concepts have sprung themselves took sight of the time phenomenon, how far they took into view the original time phenomenon, and how we can achieve the return passage from this time phenomenon first given to the original time.” 18 The appeal to multi- vocality, therefore, is a stepping-stone to attain the “original time,” which Chapter One 4 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 4"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Heidegger further identifies as the temporality (Zeitlichkeit) that is the “ontological condition of the possibility of the understanding of being.” 19 I shall return to Heidegger’s thought subsequently; it is adequate to note that he belongs to the class of philosophers who believe in the possibility of establishing the “true” nature of time. In Unreality and Time, Robert S. Brumbaugh reasonably challenges “the notion that there can be any single nature of time, to which the law of contradiction will apply as it does to substances or flowing qualities.” “We are,” he contin- ues, “dealing with a complex sequential relationship which will not exhibit any property of quantity, or quality, or relation, or modality. The assumption that we can find a suitable model, formal or mechanical, to serve as a paradigm fails as well.” 20 The second part of this statement accords with Heidegger’s petition to assemble multiple views on the nature of time expressed by thinkers through the course of time, but the justification for this venture, specified in the first part of the statement, underscores the significant difference between the two. For Brumbaugh, polysemy is a consequence of aporia; for Heidegger, it is the impe- tus to slash through the aporia. Brumbaugh identifies four analyses of time that have been operative in occidental metaphysics (beginning with Plato) and attempts to show how none is adequate to deal with the complex phenomenon of time. 21 Although no single conceptual model, whether derived from mathe- matics, physics, or philosophy, is su‹cient to explain time, Brumbaugh does not consider the quest to do so meaningless. To treat Brumbaugh’s work in the manner it demands and deserves lies beyond the scope of this chapter, but su‹ce it to say that he builds on Whitehead’s insight, which bears similarity to Husserl’s, 22 in understanding time to be a directional process constituted by irreversible “patterns of concresence” rather than self-sustained, intermonadic moments sequentially strung on a time-line. 23 The relevance of Brumbaugh’s perspective to my own imaginal thinking about time will become apparent later. For the moment let us return to Augustine and consider more carefully the context of his remark cited earlier. The reflections on time in book eleven of the Confessions come directly after the a‹rmation of the Christological doctrine of creation by the eternal Logos. Significantly, Augustine’s musing on the first verse in Genesis, “In the begin- ning God created heaven and earth,” precedes the discourse on this creed. Augustine notes that although he knew only Latin and not Hebrew, he would have understood the truth (veritas) of these words even in Moses’s own Hebrew, for truth “uses neither mouth nor tongue as instruments and utters no audible syllables,” and thus it can be stripped of any particular linguistic attire. 24 One cannot fail to note the ironic twist in Augustine’s thought. The scriptural truth that the medium of creation is the word of God finds its ultimate Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 5 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 5"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"justification in an intuition beyond the Logos in its ocular and verbal represen- tations. The only way to transcend the word, however, is through the word. To support his point exegetically, Augustine cites the words attributed to the voice that spoke from the clouds to Peter, James, and John while they were witness- ing the transfiguration of Jesus and his standing in the company of Moses and Elijah: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him” (Matt 17:5). Augustine detects here a reference to the mystery of incarnation, which he expounds in temporal terms: “Therefore it is clear and evident that the utterance came through the movement of some created thing, serving your eternal will but itself temporal [quod creaturae motus expressit eam, serviens aeternae volun- tati tuae, ipse temporalis] . And these your words, made for temporal succession, were reported by the external ear to the judicious mind whose internal ear is disposed to hear your eternal word.” 25 The “eternal word” (aeternum verbum) by which all things were created is identified as Jesus, the beginning (principium) that is wisdom (sapientia) , the silence (silentio) apprehended by way of the “inner ear” (interior posita) , the temporal instantiation of the eternal will. The word, the instrument of creation, is described, therefore, as temporal but also as coeternal with God. Insofar as the Logos participates in the divine substance, its “true eternity” and “true immor- tality” are set in diametric opposition to “time and change,” 26 and hence we cannot speak of the word as a “transient utterance” (transitoria voce) ; 27 it is, rather, the primordial saying voiced in the “simultaneity of eternity” (simul ac sempiterne) : “You call us, therefore, to understand the Word, God who is with you God (Jn 1:1). That word is spoken eternally, and by it all things are uttered eter- nally.” 28 Speaking that has no inception or terminus, no succession or inter- ruption, is not a speaking with which we are familiar, a speaking determined by change and mutability, 29 a speaking sounded in time, which is inaudible with- out transition and movement; only eternal silence can be spoken eternally. The speaking of the Logos, consequently, is “successiveness which never has any constancy.” 30 How can that which is without constancy lay claim to being suc- cessive? If nothing is constant, there is nothing to succeed, and with nothing to succeed there can be no successiveness except perhaps the succession of incon- stancy, though this, too, would depend on the constancy of succession. This paradoxical quandary illumines the fact that, for Augustine, the mystery of the word made flesh problematizes the alleged antinomy between time and eternity, motion and rest. 31 On the one hand, the word is coeternal and thus not subject to generation or decay; on the other hand, the word transpires in time, the incarnation of the word bespeaks the temporal manifestation of the eternal will, always in and of the moment—indeed the momentum of the moment is conceived from the vantage point of the enfleshment of the flesh beyond flesh, Chapter One 6 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 6"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"the envisioning of the image beyond image, the “immanence of infinitude in the finite.” 32 On this basis we can grasp why Augustine exegetically links the mystery to the verse “Today I have begotten you,” ego hodie genui te (Ps 2:7), a verse that was already applied to Jesus in Hebrews 5:5. God’s eternity is char- acterized by a today that “does not yield to a tomorrow, nor did it follow a yes- terday,” that is, the today is the fullness of a present that has neither past nor future. 33 To speak of the word being born “today” signifies the begetting of what is coeternal with God, the eternal coming-to-be of what has everlastingly been. The incarnation semiotically encodes the a/temporal transition from immutable to mutable that makes temporal creation on the part of the timeless God possible. 34 The transition cannot occur in time since it is the process that provides the very conditions for time. Alternatively expressed, the word eter- nally begotten—clearly a stumbling block to reason since the eternal cannot be begotten nor can the begotten be eternal—is the ontic source of temporality. It follows, then, that there cannot be a time when time did not exist, nec aliquo tem- pore non erat tempus. 35 In the Word, “everything which begins to be and ceases to be begins and ends its existence” precisely because it is the “eternal reason [aeterna ratione] where nothing begins or ends,” 36 the eternal law (lex aeterna) that manifests the reason (ratio) of the timeless deity in the transitory world. 37 Augustine opines further about this matter in his explication of John’s statement concerning Jesus, “They sought therefore to seize him, and no one laid hands on him because his hour had not yet come” (Jn 7:30): He was waiting for the time when he would die, because he also waited for the time when he was to be born. The apostle, speaking about this time, said, “But when the fullness of time came, God sent his Son” (Gal 4:4). That is why many ask: Why did not the Christ come before? To them it must be answered that the fullness of time had not yet come, inasmuch as he, through whom times were made, regulates [them]; for he knew when he ought to come. . . . Finally, when the fullness of time came, he who was to free us from time also came. For, freed from time, we shall come to that eternity where time is not. And there it is not asked, when will the hour come? For the day is everlasting and is not preceded by a yesterday nor closed out by a tomorrow. . . . And so we ought to love him through whom times were made, that we may be freed from time and fixed in eternity where there is no alteration of time. 38 The hour of Christ’s coming is designated the fullness of time, the “everlasting” day that is “not preceded by a yesterday nor closed out by a tomorrow.” The mystery of incarnation embodies the temporalization of the eternal—the time- less being through whom all times are made—that yields the possibility for the Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 7 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 7"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"eternalization of the temporal, the possibility for the human being to partake in the fullness of eternity realized in the simultaneity of the ever-recurring present that “flies so quickly from future into past that it is an interval with no duration.” 39 Precisely because “nothing is transient” in the eternal, the “whole is present” therein. 40 Augustine thus writes of God’s dwelling in the “sublimity of eternity which is always in the present,” 41 a state that is before all things past and beyond all things future. Nothing in time can claim to be present in this way since “all past time is driven backwards by the future, and all future time is the consequent of the past, and all past and future are created and set on their course by that which is always present.” 42 By contrast, the moment of eternity, the eternal moment, “occupies no space,” for there is no “tension between past and future” in the present of divine activity. God does not suffer human con- sciousness’s “distension” of time, the “stretching in feeling and in sense- perception” from past memories to future expectations. 43 Even for human beings the present is privileged as the mode in which all perspectives on time are apprehended, that is, memory of past experiences, perception of present sensations, and expectation of future events are discerned only from the pres- ent. In a sense, then, the only time that is real is the present. In Augustine’s own language, “Perhaps it would be exact to say: there are three times, a present of things past, a present of things present, a present of things to come. In the soul there are three aspects of time, and I do not see them anywhere else. The pres- ent considering the past is memory, the present considering the present is immediate awareness, the present considering the future is expectation.” 44 Augustine challenged the customary way of referring to three temporal tenses, for, in his opinion, past and future are only “real” as they are experi- enced in the present—in the one case as recollection and in the other as antic- ipation. In a move that had major ramifications in the history of philosophy, especially in the philosophical phenomenology formulated by Husserl, Augustine, following Plotinus, identified the soul as the place of time or, to be more specific, time is defined as a quantity in the soul (distentio ipsius animi) . 45 For Augustine, therefore, human experience of time is not linked to external space, a mode of temporality that he ascribes, in a passage in De Genesi ad litteram, to the angels, incorporeal beings not situated in space who nevertheless perform acts in a temporal sequence. In that context, the angelic beings are positioned between the Creator, who is beyond all time and space, and corporeal beings, who act in time and space. 46 Even though human beings are corporeal bodies located in space, their temporal comportment nonetheless is non-spatial (and hence angelic) inasmuch as the locus of the measure of time is in the immate- rial soul and not in external matter. If we divest Augustine’s view of its theological language, we recognize it as Chapter One 8 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 8"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"a philosophical foundation for Husserl’s phenomenology of time. On this score, it is of interest to recall the words of Jean-François Lyotard, “From book XI of the Confessions Husserl reads off the phenomenology of the internal consciousness of time. In this book Augustine sketches from below a libidinal-ontological con- stitution of temporality.” 47 Leaving aside the provocative characterization of time in the conclusion of Lyotard’s remark, for our purpose what is most significant is the recognition of the impact of Augustine’s demarcation of the soul as the site of temporal constitution on the phenomenological conception of time proffered by Husserl. Time, for Augustine, is indicative not of external objects but of the psychic mode through which these objects are represented in the human mind. The measurement of time, accordingly, applies to what endures in the consciousness of the present, not to the stream of past or future events. 48 That the soul is the locus of temporality is underscored by the empha- sis Augustine placed on the narrativity of recalling the past as well as predicting the future. Although he did not articulate it fully, Augustine seemed to have grasped the intractable link between the tempo of time and the narrative struc- ture of human consciousness exemplified in our inability to conceive of time in the absence of narrative or narrative in the absence of time. I will return to the more fully developed version of this theme in the thought of Paul Ricoeur later in this chapter. What is crucial to underscore here is that, for Augustine, even though the human soul is the ground of time, as it were, the character of tem- porality embraces a paradox that is, in the end, an inscrutable scandal to reason, a paradox inscripted most peculiarly in the incarnation of the eternal word in the body of Christ. We may gauge Augustine’s insight into the incomprehensibility and ineffa- bility of time better if we consider his thoughts on encountering the proposi- tion that “God is truth” (Jn 14:6) in the eighth book of De Trinitate. When the mind hears that truth, it sees the light of God (1 Jn 1:5), but this intellectual vision, occasioned by internal hearing, 49 is ephemeral, an instantaneous know- ing of interminable truth that is subject to neither critical inquiry nor rational analysis. 50 Augustine instructs the reader: “Do not ask: ‘What is Truth?’ [Jn 18:38]. For at once the mists of bodily images and the clouds of phantasms will obstruct your view, and obscure the brightness which shone upon you at the first flash when I said ‘Truth.’ Remain in it, if you can, but if you cannot, you will fall back into those wonted early thoughts.” 51 In the continuation, Augustine answers his own rhetorical question by noting the lamentable state of the human predicament, which prevents us from persisting in the luster of everlasting truth. The decisive point is the a‹nity in Augustine’s thinking between the texture of time and the contour of God’s truth: Just as one cannot ask about the proposition that God is truth, as this truth is grasped intuitively, Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 9 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 9"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"so one cannot ask about time, as the truth of time, manifest most pristinely in the nunc stans, the moment that becomes eternally in the ephemerality of being, is not rationally discernible. Prima facie, the comparison might strike one as dubious, given the unequiv- ocal distinction Augustine draws between the fixity of eternity and the muta- bility of time, the constancy of God and the variableness of creation, 52 a per- spective that can be traced conceptually to Plato’s exposition in the first hypothesis of the Parmenides that the One, the ultimate principle of metaphysical unity, does not come to be and is thus not a “tensed being,” subject to the fluctuations of time. 53 Any attempt “to taste eternity” when one’s heart is “still flitting about in the realm where things change and have a past and future” proves futile. 54 The logic underlying the binary opposition is transparent: A being that suffers generation and decay, the law of the temporal order, neces- sarily changes, but the simplicity of the divine being—characterized variously by Augustine as “that which is” (id quod est) , “what truly is” (id quod vere est) , “true being” (vere esse) , “being itself” (ipsum esse) — cannot be subject to alteration and thus cannot be affected by ephemeral occurrences. 55 Moreover, every existent being must be either that which truly is or ontically dependent on that which truly is. Hence, the being that truly is comprehends everything in its own being; and since that being is simple and immutable, it must contain everything in an eternal present that precludes complexity or alteration. Therein lies the crucial difference between time and eternity, but also their point of contiguity: “In the eternal, nothing is transient, but the whole is present. But no time is wholly present.” 56 For Augustine, eternity is not infinite duration, for infinite duration, though infinite, is duration nonetheless and is consequently measurable; the eternal, by contrast, must be immeasurable, the absolutely timeless as opposed to the unendingly time-bound . 57 Augustine’s analysis of time leads him to the con- clusion that the moment itself, the only temporal tense we can a‹rm as real, is analogously without duration and hence incalculable. The present time, which can never be the time of presence, is the eternalized instant that “is not a dis- tention to immeasurability but is rather its outside,” in the manner that silence is outside, and thus still part of, the province of language. 58 Eternity, therefore, is the perpetual reappearance of what repeatedly disappears, a present that has no past or future, memory without memorable imprint. 59 Significantly, Augustine describes his intellectual vision of God in these very terms: “So in the flash of a trembling glance it attained to that which is. At that moment I saw your ‘invisible nature understood through the things which are made’ (Rom 1:20). But I did not possess the strength to keep my vision fixed.” 60 In spite of the seemingly incontrovertible divergence between eternity and time on philo- Chapter One 10 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 10"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"sophical grounds, in theological terms—that is, in the language of faith—the one informs us about the nature of the other; to see the light that is God, one beholds with the mind’s eye the flow of time in the flight of eternity. Echoing the Augustinian position many centuries later, Kierkegaard surmised that the “moment is really time’s atom, but not until eternity is posited, and this is why one may properly say that eternity is always in §n étÒmv ̧ [the moment].” 61 Augustine’s quandary, as Husserl correctly understood, is a matter of inter- pretation, not experience, that is, the di‹culty of determining the nature of time lies not in suffering the events themselves—“we all know what time is”— but in giving an adequate “account of time-consciousness, to put objective time and subjective time-consciousness into the proper relationship and to reach an understanding of how temporal objectivity — and therefore any individual objectivity whatever—can become constituted in the subjective consciousness of time.” 62 In a similar vein, Wittgenstein observed that what is perplexing to the mind is not the phenomenal experience of temporal duration as such but discerning the “kind of statement” (die Art der Aussagen) appropriate to articulate it. 63 The reasonableness of the distinction notwithstanding, the telling of time— recounting events in an extending and purportedly continuous chain of remem- brance and anticipation—is not easily separated from the experience of time. But what is it that we experience? Having thought through the labyrinth of log- ical puzzles connected to reflection on the nature of time, Augustine holds fast to the conclusion that it is inexact to speak of three tenses, since neither past nor future exists independently of the present; thus, if one is to accord meaning to the customary way of speaking about time, the three times will be interpreted as three aspects of the moment, “a present of things past, a present of things present, a present of things to come. In the soul there are these three aspects of time, and I do not see them anywhere else. The present considering the past is the memory, the present considering the present is immediate awareness, the present considering the future is expectation.” 64 For Augustine, therefore, the true reality of time is not adduced from the measure of bodies in motion but from the distension of mind, the vital force of being manifest in the successive spreading out of the soul between recollection and expectation, 65 a psycholog- ical process that mimics the foundational mystery of Christian faith, the incar- nation of the eternal Word at a particular point in time, an historical event that summons an abiding-in-being-born rather than the passing-away that is char- acteristic of all things ephemeral. 66 In some respects, Augustine anticipated the view of Henri Bergson for whom time is expressive of the creative impulse of being, the élan vital, the “pure dura- tion,” which he contrasts sharply with measured time, casting the two in a series of antinomies—succession and simultaneity, alteration and homogeneity, Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 11 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 11"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"intensive magnitude and spatial representation. Science demonstrates unequiv- ocally the human mind’s capacity to measure time mathematically—though, in point of fact, real time is never so measured—a tendency to “empty” the “con- tent” of time “into a space of four dimensions in which past, present and future are juxtaposed or superimposed for all eternity.” In the spatialization of time, “conscious duration and real motion” are replaced—Bergson’s language is pre- cise, “replaced” and not “translated”—by the “mathematical point that has been carried over from space to time.” What we call time is but a contrived artifice that “infuses living duration into a time dried up as a space.” 67 Real duration is experienced as an unfolding of time that cannot be measured unless it is spatially converted. This experience, moreover, is not subject to articula- tion, since language cannot a‹x meaning to the temporal flow without arrest- ing its mobility. 68 Going beyond the Bergsonian notion of time as inner duration in the direc- tion of the more technical phenomenological analyses of Husserl, temporal fluidity is ascribed to the intentional structure of internal time-consciousness. 69 Husserl would have agreed with Bergson that reflection imposes the form of objective time upon an evanescent living present, but, in his mind, even the present has to be construed as a constitution of temporal intentionality striving for—though never finally achieving—a unitary object in the flux of manifold lived experiences. 70 The present is not an “impressional point” lodged between past and future but rather a “concatenation of temporal phases” composed of retention and protention. 71 I shall revisit this aspect of Husserl’s conception of time. Worth underscoring here is his acute sensibility that human consciousness displays a hybrid nature, as it both constitutes and is constituted by an ego-self 72 that is constricted within necessarily limited boundaries, embodied, as we are, in an encasing that comes-to-be and passes-away, that is, an embodiment that is of necessity mortal and thus evidently time-bound. 73 Is there anything more basic to human experience than the temporal socialization that gives scope and meaning to the span of individual and communal life? 74 “Doing time” is what we are primordially, not in the sense of chronological priority but in the man- ner of persisting in time as the evolving self (more process than substance) acutely attuned to bearing the destiny of being the being that is yet to become no more. 75 Internal Time-Consciousness and Temporal Coherence One of phenomenology’s most significant contributions to the history of phi- losophy is the privileged status accorded to time in determining the nature of Chapter One 12 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 12"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"human consciousness — and, reciprocally, the privileged status attributed to human consciousness in determining the nature of time. 76 Merleau-Ponty hit the mark when he insisted that we should no longer think of time as a “datum of consciousness,” that it is more precise to say “consciousness unfolds or con- stitutes time.” 77 The phenomenological consideration of time has as its focus the “intersection of time and human experience, where time is human and human experience is temporal.” 78 This orientation is rooted in Plotinus, whose medi- tations on time rest on two presuppositions: first, an elaboration of the Platonic conjecture that time is the “moving image of eternity” 79 and, second, a rejec- tion of Aristotle’s demarcation of time as the measure of the motion of bodies with respect to a “before” and an “after.” 80 For Plotinus, still indebted to Aristotle, determining the nature of time centers on understanding the rela- tionship between movement and distance, a relationship that is tied to the mat- ter of number. As he puts it, “Movement which extends over a distance and the distance covered by it are not the actual thing, time, but are in time. But if someone were to say that the distance of movement is time, not in the sense of the distance of movement itself, but that in relation to which the movement has its extension, as if it was running along with it, what this is has not been stated. For it is obvious that time is that in which movement has occurred. ” 81 The decisive feature of temporality is extension, “spreading out” (diastasis) , and consequently the ability to compute the duration and passage of events is central to the human experience of time. “So the spreading out of life involves time; life’s continual progress involves continuity of time; and life which is past involves past time.” 82 Unlike Aristotle, however, Plotinus locates the primary site of extension in the psychic rather than somatic domain. Hence it is proper to speak of time as the “life of the soul in a movement of passage [kinesei metabatike] from one way of life to another.” 83 To be sure, Aristotle himself was aware that our sense of time’s passage is dependent on the mental experience of movement and change; thus, as he states explicitly, when one is conscious of no change, it seems as if no time has elapsed. 84 Centuries later, Hobbes reiterated the Aristotelian conception: “As a body leaves a phantasm of its magnitude in the mind, so also a moved body leaves a phantasm of its motion, namely, an idea of that body passing out of one space into another by continual succession. And this idea, or phantasm, is that, which (without receding much from the common opinion, or from Aristotle’s definition) I call Time. ” 85 Nevertheless, it is important to recall that Aristotle understood time more precisely as the measure of the movement of bodies, not souls, in space. Time is not simply an idea or phantasm; it is the idea or phantasm that corresponds to the measure of the motion of a body periodically moving and resting in space. By contrast, Plotinus spoke of time as the movement of a soul from one state to another. Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 13 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 13"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"In the fifth century, Proclus elaborated the Plotinian perspective on time in language worthy of our consideration. Echoing the view that time is the mea- sure of things in motion, Proclus argued, “All that is measured by time either in its existence or in its activity is in the process of coming-to-be in that respect in which it is measured by time.” 86 As a necessary corollary, what moves per- petually cannot be measured by time, for it can never be said to come to be, and consequently it can have no temporal origin or end. What moves perpetually is imperishable, incomposite, and self-constituted, 87 transcending all that is mea- sured by time. 88 Following an etymology proffered by Aristotle 89 and reiterated by Plotinus, 90 Proclus defines the “eternal” (aionion) as that which “always is” (aei on), in contrast to the temporal being that incessantly comes-to-be. 91 Applying his theory of causality based on a tripartite system of participation—the unpar- ticipated (amethekton) , participated (metechomenon) , and participant (metechon) 92 — Proclus establishes two principles of being to articulate the contours of our temporal comportment in the world: “Prior to all things eternal there exists Eternity; and prior to all things temporal, Time. . . . For the eternal things are many, and likewise the temporal: all the former have an eternity by participa- tion, all the latter a time which is parcelled out. But prior to these are the undi- vided Eternity and the one Time; these are Eternity of eternities and the Time of times, since they generate the participated terms.” 93 Rather than positioning eternity and time in an antithetical binary, Proclus views both as “measures of life and movement in things”—eternity the mea- sure of things interminable and time the measure of things terminable. 94 Concerning the latter, it is necessary to distinguish, moreover, between sub- stances that have permanent duration and thus exemplify the character of “per- petual time” (aidios chronos) and others that have a temporary existence and there- fore partake only of a “part of time” (pote en merei chronou) . Insofar as transitory beings cannot be considered truly real, since true being is not subject to coming-to-be, it follows that time is the measure of that which perpetually comes-to-be, for in virtue of “its perpetuity it imitates the eternal nature.” 95 Two kinds of perpetuity are differentiated by Proclus: “the one eternal, the other in time; the one a perpetual steadfastness, the other a perpetual process; the one having its existence concentrated in a simultaneous whole, the other diffused and unfolded in temporal extension; the one entire in itself, the other composed of parts each of which exists separately in an order of succession.” 96 On the basis of this differentiation, three levels of being may be distinguished: the “impar- tible perpetuity” (aidiotes ameristos) 97 of eternity beyond time; the perpetuity of “intransitive intellection” (ametabatos noesis) 98 attributed to the intellect, the eter- nal image of eternity, time at rest; and the temporal, which is always in motion and hence is perpetual in a derivative sense. 99 Proclus speaks of three successive Chapter One 14 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 14"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"entities: the “one being” (to hen on hos) , the “monad of all being” (monas t o n onton) , which, in virtue of its absolute oneness, is beyond attribution; “eternity” (aion) , the dyad that “always is” (o aei on) ; and “the eternal” (to aionion) , which partici- pates in the conjunction of “always” and “existence” but not with the same degree of durability as in the case of eternity. 100 In contrast to the “friends of Plato,” that is, Plotinus and other Neoplatonists, who considered time an “obscure notion” linked to the motion of the soul that is measurable, 101 Proclus insists that time’s essence is more divine than that of the soul. 102 Certainly, he accepts the proposition that if something partakes of soul, it partakes of time; but for him the converse is not true, as there are beings without soul that par- take of time, and thus one must conclude that “time is beyond the soul” (chronon epekeina psych e s) . 103 Time is engendered from the desire of the Intellect, identified as the Platonic demiurge, to overflow and to fill all things, 104 and in this sense it is the imitation of eternity, though it is actualized in the physical world by the principle of self-motion enacted in the Soul. The nature of time appropriate to the Intellect is imparticipable (amethektos chronos) , that is, the monadic, and con- sequently motionless, time, for what is truly one is incomposite and hence can- not be subject to change, whereas temporal extension, the ceaseless motion that emulates the steadfastness of eternity, is located in the soul. As Proclus puts it, “Every intra-mundane soul, having movement and exercising a temporal activ- ity, will have a periodic motion, and also cyclic reinstatements (since in the case of things perpetual every period ends in a reinstatement of the original condi- tion).” 105 Psychic motion exhibits the character of perpetuity, which is associ- ated in Hellenic thought with the rotation of a sphere, considered to be the most perfect form of movement. E. R. Dodds has cogently outlined the Aristotelian principles underlying the Proclean theorem: “The physical universe is finite save in the sense that finite bodies are potentially divisible ad infinitum. ... And movement in a finite space can continue through an infinite time only by returning periodically to its starting-point. Hence the only movement which is both continuous and perpetual is a circular movement, like that of the heavenly bodies.” 106 For Proclus, the way of the soul mirrors the way of the heavenly bodies, and thus, as he further adduces, “every psychic period is measured by time”; the soul is characterized by circular motion, continuous and perpetual, and it is in this sense that time is the image of eternity. The way of the soul, like the spiritual power (dunamis) of being more generally, undergoes procession and reversion in relation to its source. 107 In his commentary on Plato’s Parmenides, Proclus reiterates this point by noting that what is nonreceptive to time applies to the One and not the Soul, “for all soul partakes in time and uses periods measured by time. The One, indeed, is superior to Soul because all Soul partakes in time, and the One will be shown now not to partake in time; but Intellect Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 15 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 15"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"also is different from Soul for the same reasons, being pure from all temporal activity, so that by means of these distinctions we are able to discern and recog- nise the three ruling hypostases.” 108 Time is understood most elementally as the measure of the motion of the soul’s journey, a narratological conception that Reiner Schürman traces to the visionary poem of Parmenides, a philosophic unveiling of truth, or perhaps more accurately, an unveiling of the unveiling, a path that “integrates conceal- ing into unconcealing,” the one way of “concealment/unconcealment, for which the word alétheia suggests our wresting ourselves away from contrary rep- resentations and the conquest of a unitary point of view.” 109 The experience of time is intimately coupled with the computation of the mythic account of the psychic voyage, 110 the verbal gesticulation that reveals the soul’s passing through the gates of night and day to cross the threshold from the “way of seeming” to the “way of truth,” the flight of mind from transient objects of sense (aisthet a ) to eternal objects of contemplation (noeton) . 111 There is much to say about Parmenides and his impact on the history of Western philosophy, but most relevant here is the point that Plotinus’s demarcation of soul as the locus for the measure of time may be viewed as an embellishment of the Parmenidean conception of originary time. 112 Needless to say, there are fundamental differ- ences; most significantly, for Plotinus and like-minded Neoplatonists, time applies not only to individual souls but also, indeed primarily, to the “first soul,” that is, the world soul of the Platonic tradition. 113 In a universe thought to be closed, limitless motion—the quality experienced in the flow of time— can express itself in the recurrent coming-to-be and passing-away of the soul, the perpetual return whither it must always have never been. The most perfect mode of temporal activity, therefore, the place where time and eternity inter- sect, where eternity is eternally temporal and time temporally eternal, is assigned to the world soul. Proclus, accordingly, asserts that “the soul with which temporal measurement begins has the whole of time for measure.” 114 This account of the interiorization of the temporal unquestionably influenced Augustine’s definition of time as a distension of the mind (distentio animi) , 115 a position that approximates the present-day emphasis on the locus of temporal- ity in internal time-consciousness. 116 In modern philosophical discourse, Kant established the foundation for the phenomenological viewpoint, or what has been felicitously called the “reflexive temporalization of time,” 117 by insisting on the “transcendental ideality” of the temporal sensibility. 118 To be more pre- cise, Kant identified both space and time as “pure forms of sensible intuition,” the “two sources of cognition” that impart the necessary conditions for the syn- thetic knowledge that shapes all human experience. Yet he accorded a privileged status to time, for space is “limited as an a priori condition merely to outer intu- Chapter One 16 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 16"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"itions,” whereas time, being linked to the inner sense, is the “ a priori formal con- dition of all appearances in general.” 119 The logic behind Kant’s assessment is clear enough: All mental representations, even if they correspond to external objects, are determinations of the mind and thus belong to the inner intuition, which cannot be understood except through the modalities of time; we cannot think of consciousness in the absence of time, nor time in the absence of con- sciousness. 120 Indeed, for Kant, we cannot account for human experience with- out presuming the unity of self-consciousness—the hypothetical construct of transcendental apperception — the “I think” that accompanies all representations and thereby holds manifold sensory data together in time. 121 “I am an object of inner sense and all time is merely the form of inner sense. . . . For it really says no more than that in the whole time in which I am conscious of myself, I am conscious of this time as belonging to the unity of my Self, and it is all the same whether I say that this whole time is in Me, as an individual unity, or that I am to be found with numerical identity, in all of this time.” 122 Time, therefore, is given epistemological preference over space as the form of intuition that pro- vides the structure of the phenomenal datum as such: time cannot be removed from appearances without there ceasing to be appearances. 123 John R. Searle captures the point succinctly: “Since Kant we have been aware of an asymme- try in the way that consciousness relates to space and to time. Although we experience objects and events as both spatially extended and of temporal dura- tion, our consciousness itself is not experienced as spatial, though it is experi- enced as temporally extended. Indeed, the spatial metaphors for describing time seem almost inevitable for consciousness as well, as when we speak for exam- ple of the ‘stream of consciousness.’ ” 124 The privileging of time would prove to have a profound impact on subsequent philosophical and scientific specula- tions on the nature of being. 125 Husserl elaborated on the Kantian position in a 1905 lecture—published in 1966 as volume 10 in the Husserliana series with the title Zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewußtseins (1893–1917) —o n his signature notion of the internal time- consciousness (inneren Zeitbewußtseins) , which deals, more specifically, with the “double intentionality of retention and the constitution of the flow of con- sciousness.” “This prephenomenal, preimmanent temporality becomes consti- tuted intentionally as the form of the time-constituting consciousness and in it itself. The flow of the consciousness that constitutes immanent time not only exists but is so remarkably and yet intelligibly fashioned that a self-appearance of the flow necessarily exists in it, and therefore the flow itself must necessarily be apprehensible in the flowing.” 126 In the flow of consciousness, which cannot be isolated from consciousness of the flow, constituting and constituted coin- cide. 127 Mathematical time, like geometric space, is an idealized abstraction, a Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 17 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 17"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"logical substructure constructed and imposed on the concrete forms of the intu- itable life-world (Lebenswelt) , the world of experience (Erfahrungswelt) , revealed from the surrounding precategorical world (Umwelt) . 128 “Immanent time” thus “becomes objectivated into a time of objects constituted in the immanent appearances . . . in the multiplicity of adumbrations of the sensation-contents understood as unities belonging to phenomenological time.” 129 In the second of his Cartesianische Meditationen (written in 1929 but first published in French translation in 1933), Husserl offered a slightly different account of the matter: The all-embracing cogitatum <of reflection> is the all-embracing life itself, with its openly endless unity and wholeness. . . . The fundamental form of this universal syn- thesis, the form that makes all other syntheses of consciousness possible, is the all- embracing consciousness of internal time. The correlate of this consciousness is immanent temporality itself, in conformity with which all the life-processes belonging to the ego that can ever be found reflectively must present themselves as temporally ordered, temporally beginning and ending, simultaneous or successive, within the constant infinite horizon: immanent time. The distinction between <internal> time itself and the consciousness of <internal> time can be expressed also as that between the subjective process in internal time, or the temporal form of this pro- cess, and the modes of its temporal appearance, as the corresponding “multiplicities.” As these modes of appearance, which make up the consciousness of internal time, are themselves “intentive components of conscious life” [“intentionale Erlebnisse”] and must in turn be given in reflection as temporalities, we encounter here a paradoxical fun- damental property of conscious life, which seems thus to be infected with an infi- nite regress. 130 The “consciousness of internal time” is made up of “intentive components of conscious life,” but these intentive components themselves can only be “given in reflection as temporalities.” The paradox is expressed in slightly different terms in Husserl’s depiction of the intentional constitution of the “empirical ego” by the “phenomenological ego” in Logische Untersuchungen (1900–1901): When I say “cohered continuously with it in unity,” I refer to the unity of the concrete phenomenological whole, whose parts are either abstract aspects ... or pieces from whose nature spring forms of coexistent unity, . . . These “unities of coexistence” pass continuously into one another from one moment to the next, composing a unity of change, of the stream of consciousness, which in turn de- mands the continuous persistence, or no continuous change, of at least one aspect essential for its total unity, and so inseparable from it as a whole. This part is played by the presentative form of time which is immanent in the stream of consciousness, which later appears as a unity in time (not in the time of the world of things, but Chapter One 18 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 18"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"in the time which appears together with the stream of consciousness itself, and in which the stream flows). Each instant of time is given in a continuous projective series (so-to-speak) “time-sensations”; in each actual phase of the stream of consciousness the whole time-horizon of the stream is presented, and it thereby possesses a form overreaching all its contents, which remains the same form con- tinuously, though its content steadily alters. This accordingly forms the phenome- nological content of the ego, of the empirical ego in the sense of the psychic subject. Phenomenological reduction yields the really self-enclosed, temporally growing unity of the stream of experience. 131 The “phenomenological whole” is located in the “unities of coexistence,” which cohere to form the stream of consciousness. The oneness experienced therein is “unity of change,” that is, unity that emerges from the constancy of change, the novelty of each instant, recurring enduringly as the present having passed in the immediate presence of what has never been. 132 For Husserl, the “presentative form of time” is the intentional structure that provides the tem- poral synthesis required for one to become aware of objects persisting through time. 133 The very possibility of comprehending a “temporal object” (Zeitobjekt) , therefore, is dependent on a “temporalizing” (zeitigend) of the original flow (Flüß) of prereflective consciousness, which constitutes the external objectivity dis- played in the duration of things that appear as well as the internal subjectivity by which the flow of consciousness itself endures. 134 In the final analysis, Husserl’s phenomenological method of the epoché—the suspension of judg- ment with regard to the actuality or nonactuality of the contents of conscious- ness—seeks to disclose world and ego without being ensnared in the traditional binary of objectivity and subjectivity. To the extent that the “world” is alive as a datum of consciousness, it coheres immanently as an intentional form of sub- jectivity in the world; analogously, to the extent that the “subject” is constituted by the structure of intentionality, it inheres transcendentally as a constructed object of the world in subjectivity. 135 In Die Krisis der europäischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale Phänomenologie: Eine Einleitung in die phänomenologische Philosophie (composed from 1934 to 1937 though not published until 1954), Husserl deals with the juxtaposition of “subjectivity in the world as object” and the “conscious subject for the world” under the rubric “paradox of human subjectivity: being a subject for the world and at the same time being an object in the world.” 136 Acknowledging that as a conse- quence of the phenomenological reduction “everything objective is trans- formed into something subjective,” Husserl is quick to point out that “this can- not be meant in such a way that through this method the existing world and the human world-representation are set over against each other and that, on the Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 19 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 19"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"ground of the world, taken for granted as actually existing, we inquire into the subjective, i.e., into the psychic occurrences in men through which they gain experience of the world, everyday or scientific opinions about the world, their particular sensible and conceptual ‘world-pictures.’ ” Notwithstanding the attempt to distance his own perspective from an idealistic reduction of all beings to mental constructs, Husserl is not able to free himself entirely from the grip of this philosophic orientation. The nucleus of Husserl’s transcendental idealism is expressed in his remark that “in the pure attitude focused upon correlations, created by the epoché, the world, the objective, becomes itself something subjective.” 137 Within the brackets of the suspension, therefore, the world is transformed into a “transcendental phenomenon,” which “is from the start taken only as a correlate of the subjective appearances, views, subjective acts and capacities through which it constantly has, and ever attains anew, its changeable [but] unitary sense .... The epoché, in giving us the attitude above the subject-object correlation which belongs to the world and thus the attitude of focus upon the transcendental subject-object correlation, leads us to recognize, in self-reflection, that the world exists for us, that is, our world in its being and being-such, takes its ontic meaning entirely from our intentional life through a priori types of accom- plishments that can be exhibited rather than argumentatively constructed or conceived through mythical thinking.” 138 But it is here that the epistemological di‹culty emerges, as we confront a seemingly insoluble paradox: on the one hand, human consciousness assumes the task of a “world-constituting subjec- tivity,” yet, on the other, it is “incorporated in the world itself.” 139 Simply put, how can the self be the agent of the construction of the world when it is a com- ponent of the world so constructed? Husserl’s resolution of the paradox depends on discerning that notions of subjective identity such as “soul” or “psychic life” belong to the “phenomena” of the world as a constituted pole of the transcendental subject-object correla- tion, and, consequently, the “I” that is attained in the epoché—a modality of consciousness that precedes the dyadic division precipitated by the structure of intentionality—is called “I” only by equivocation. 140 “The epoché creates a unique sort of philosophical solitude which is the fundamental methodical requirement for a truly radical philosophy. In this solitude I am not a single individual who has somehow willfully cut himself off from the society of mankind .... All of mankind, and the whole distinction and ordering of the personal pronouns, has become a phenomenon within my epoché; and so has the privilege of I-the-man among other men.” 141 The “I” ascertained within the phenomenological bracket exhibits “uniqueness and personal indeclinabil- ity”(the always singular “I”) but it is at the same time a “privileged member” of Chapter One 20 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 20"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"the “transcendental intersubjectivity” (one “I” among others ), the community of “cosubjects” constituting the world as “world for all.” Husserl elucidates the matter by examining the process of “self-temporalization” through the prism of the “transcendental exposition of recollection”: Thus the immediate “I” performs an accomplishment through which it constitutes a variational mode of itself as existing (in the mode of having passed). Starting from this we can trace how the immediate “I,” flowingly-statically present, consti- tutes itself in self-temporalization as enduring through “its” pasts. In the same way, the immediate “I,” already enduring in the enduring primordial sphere, constitutes in itself another as other. Self-temporalization through depresentation [Ent-Gegenwärtigung] , so to speak (through recollection), has its analogue in my self- alienation [Ent-Fremdung] (empathy as a depresentation of a higher level — depresen- tation of my primal presence [Urpräsenz] into a merely presentified [vergegenwärtigte] primal presence). 142 Husserl describes the “I” of the immediate presence of the present, which is identified as the time of the “enduring primordial sphere,” in the evocative elo- cution “flowingly-statically present,” a turn of phrase meant to traverse the polarities of stasis and motion, substance and process, thing and event. Inasmuch as the “I” of the present constitutes itself as enduring through its past, self- temporalization is said to occur through “depresentation,” that is, the recollec- tion in the immediate presence of what is no longer present, the absent pres- ence—presently absent, the present absence—absently present. In the same manner, Husserl speaks of “self-alienation” to account for the discernment of the other in the constitution of self. The “depresentation” of one’s “primal presence” into a “merely presentified primal presence” marks the shift from the singular “I” to the communal “I” of transcendental intersubjectivity, a transformation that makes possible the eidetic correlation of subject-object in the noetic/noematic field of consciousness before the distinction of subject and object, and the pre- sumed constitution of the latter as an expression of the former. Time, in its phenomenological comportment as immanent temporality, serves as the bridge that links the two aspects of the Lebenswelt, the egoic stratum of intentionality and the hyletic stratum of the universe, without reducing one to the other—the metaphor of the bridge is employed to preserve the differ- ences of what are joined together—and thereby lapsing into a contrived choice between realism and idealism. The possibility of representation is dependent on the living presence of the time of the present, but this presence embraces the past as a presence no longer present, a presence retained as the absence recol- lected in the present time projected into the future. The “continuous persis- Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 21 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 21"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"tence” of internal time-consciousness is thus glossed as “continuous change,” for only change persists in time. By the same token, in and through the stream- ing of time the self comes to be threaded together, as it were, into a semblance of unified identity by the “intentive components of conscious life.” 143 In Ideen zu einer reinen Phänomenologie und phänomenologischen Philosophie (1913), Husserl characterized “phenomenological” time, in contrast to “objective” or “cosmic” time, as a “unitary form of all experiences within a single stream of experience (that of one pure Ego).” 144 Temporality, we are told, “indicates not only something that belongs in a general way to every single experience, but a necessary form binding experiences with experiences. ” 145 In the domain of internal time- consciousness, change is invariable, the flux binding. As Husserl says in the sec- ond book of the Ideen, which focuses on the phenomenology of constitution (a treatise he kept revising until 1928 that was published for the first time posthu- mously in 1952 by the Husserl-Archives): All the unities we have discussed are unities in reference to a pure Ego, whose stream of consciousness they belong to and as whose “possessions” they are consti- tuted. And the stream of consciousness, as a totality, builds itself up as a phenome- nal unity. All my lived experiences, the successive and the coexisting, on which I focus, have the unity of a flux of time. That which belongs immanently to a flux of time possesses a perceivable, adequately graspable, unity. The unity of imma- nence is the unity of a constant flux, in the nexus of which all immanent duration and change are constituted. 146 The “unity of immanence” arises not through stringing together a series of discrete moments but through the co/herence of successive and coexisting lived experiences in consciousness, the time-flow, which is always consciousness of the present, even though that present is compresently past and future. In think- ing the presence of the present, we bring to mind the absence of past and future as the boundaries by which the present is formed. 147 This idea, and par- ticularly the focus on the concept of boundary or limit (die Grenze) in assessing the intentional character of temporal continuity, was expressed by Husserl’s teacher, Franz Brentano. 148 Describing the nature of temporal relations in a dis- course dictated relatively late in his life (February 22, 1915), he remarked: “It seems certain that we can never think of anything without thinking of some- thing as present, that is to say, however, as on a boundary line which exists as the connecting point of an otherwise non-existent continuum or as providing its beginning or its end.” 149 Our intuition of time, according to Brentano, is linked exclusively to the moment, 150 the point of the present that divides the contin- uum into potentially limitless parts that converge transcendentally in the bound- Chapter One 22 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 22"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"ary of boundless temporal determinations but in so doing allows a sense of con- tinuity between what has come before and what will come after. 151 The pre- sumption of continuity is necessary to account for the fact that intended objects of human experience appear in consciousness under the guise of the three tem- poral modes of presentation (Modi des Vorstellens) : past, present, and future. 152 Now it is true that everything which is in time is present, existing now. But never- theless it is not something existing in isolation in and of itself. It is rather continu- ing, or ending or beginning. It cannot exist without a relation of continuity [Kontinual- relation] to what is earlier or later and it is thereby connected with things which are separated from it, some by a greater and some by a lesser interval. . . . Having a finite far-ranging connection of this sort with other things is part of the concept of the present. Without this relational character it could not be conceived nor could it ever be an element of something with temporal duration and development. 153 According to Brentano, the temporal modes of presentation are acquired in an “original” experience of association, an inner perception that he calls proter- aesthesis, described in a brief excursus (dictated in 1914) on the “temporally con- tinuous” nature of the “real”—a term that alludes to Brentano’s reism, the doctrine that the object of thought must be considered a “real thing” (Reales) whether it is presented in the mind directly (in recto) or obliquely (in obliquo) 154 — as the “boundary-sensation which experiences the primary object as present” but also as “continuously manifold.” 155 On the one hand, temporal experience is of necessity constricted to a present that is isolated from past and future, but, on the other hand, the point of the present “cannot be set apart for itself because it is a mere boundary.” Brentano draws the logical conclusion: “So also per- ceiving cannot possibly exist for itself in a single isolated point in time so as to be reduced to a temporally punctual perceiving. . . . For after all, everything else that is temporal exists only in a point without existing isolated in this point— in virtue of its connection in infinitesimal transition with what is past or future.” The “temporal point,” therefore, can be grasped “without our grasp- ing any preceding or following stretch of time, in spite of the fact that the tem- poral point itself cannot be without that which precedes or follows.” The “boundary-character” of the present “allows us to recognise its belonging to something that it bounds. Yet this boundary-character requires no specific mag- nitude of extension; it does not even require the existence of any specific sec- ond point in time, however close this might be for the first. And thus the grasp- ing will perfectly well be capable of being limited to what is in the present; indeed it must be so limited already for the sake of its evidence, as also because of the infinite complication which would otherwise ensue.” 156 Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 23 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 23"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"In the terms Husserl used in the passage cited earlier, the stream, though ever- evolving, can be conceived as a “totality,” a “phenomenal unity,” a “unity of constant flux, in the nexus of which all immanent duration and change are con- stituted.” The coherence—what Husserl refers to as temporal determination, the dura- tion of a thing as temporally extended 157 — embraces a threefold noetic structure that can be accounted for psychologically and ontically. That is, Husserl speaks of three primary types of intentional experience, retention, imagination, and expec- tation, that parallel the division of time into past, present, and future. 158 In the structure of ego the three converge, as imagination cannot function without retention or retention without expectation. Analogously, when we speak of con- sciousness, it is always consciousness of the present, but a present informed by the confluence of three temporalities; indeed, what presents itself as the flowing now-point is illumined from the shadow of what has been and springs forth from the ground of what shall be. “In each primal phase that originally consti- tutes the immanent content we have retentions of the preceding phases and pro- tentions of the coming phases of precisely this content. . . . These ‘determinate’ retentions and protentions have an obscure horizon; in flowing away, they turn into indeterminate retentions and protentions related to the past and future course of the stream. It is through the indeterminate retentions and protentions that the actually present content is inserted into the unity of the stream.” 159 From this perspective it is correct to say that, for Husserl, the transcendental constitu- tion of objective time and the consciousness of temporal immanence are inten- tional acts of human imagination. 160 Making-Present/Temporal Emplacement In La Voix et le Phénomène (1967), Derrida remarked that, for Husserl, the “now,” or the “punctuality of the instant,” is a‹rmed as the “nondisplaceable center,” “eye,” and “living core” of temporality. 161 Derrida correctly noted that the now- point (nunc stans) so conceived is a “spatial or mechanical metaphor” related to the “metaphysical concept” of “self-presence,” but he has not done justice to the complexity of Husserl’s conception of the present (and thus of temporality more generally) as consisting of intermonadic moments linked in a continuum of retentions and protentions that makes up our experience of duration, an expand- ing chain extending to and beyond the “horizon of futurity.” In other words, Husserl’s nunc stans is far from being a mechanical or spatial metaphor. On the contrary, in a manner that actually anticipates Derrida’s critique of understand- ing presence in terms of an adequately given present, in Husserl’s view the liv- ing now is not a fixed point with discrete boundaries. 162 “It is evident that each time-point has its before and after, and that the points and extended sections that Chapter One 24 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 24"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"are before cannot be compressed in the fashion of an approach to a mathemat- ical limit, such as the limit of intensity. . . . A now is always and essentially a border-point of an extent of time.” 163 Acknowledging that the claim that the “flow of consciousness” (der Fluß des Bewußtseins) is a “succession” (Aufeinanderfolge) depends on fulfilling the conditions for “the possibility of the consciousness of succession” (der Möglichkeit des Bewußtseins der Folge) , Husserl nevertheless insists that it is incorrect to speak of ultimate consciousness as temporal, let alone to posit that the present moment should be considered a time-object (Zeitobjekt) that per- sists in consciousness. In his own unambiguous language: The flow of the modes of consciousness is not a process; the consciousness of the now is not itself now [Der Fluß der Bewußtseinsmodi ist kein Vorgang, das Jetzt-Bewußtsein ist nicht selbst jetzt]. The retention that exists “together” with the consciousness of the now is not “now,” is not simultaneous with the now, and it would make no sense to say that it is. . . . Memory [Erinnerung] is an expression that always and only refers to a constituted temporal object. Retention, on the other hand, is an expression used to designate the intentional relation (a fundamentally different relation) of phase of conscious- ness to phase of consciousness; and in this case the phases of consciousness and continuities of consciousness must not be regarded as temporal objects themselves. 164 The very structures necessary to the constitution of time-consciousness are “ nontemporal, that is to say, nothing in immanent time. ” 165 Husserl’s conception of the flow of experience (Erlebnisstrom) , moreover, presupposes temporal irreversibility, 166 that is, each moment displays the character of a monad that cannot be re- peated. 167 Hence, we cannot say of the past that it returns; reminiscence of the past is predicated precisely on its no longer being present. The irreversible char- acter of time precludes the possibility of reverting to the past in the present or of repeating the present in the future, but these very impossibilities facilitate the re/presentation of past and future in the present. Enzo Paci sagaciously sum- marized the “temporal dialectic” implicit in Husserl’s thought: “Since every- thing originates in present life, in this dialectic the origin as past, in passing from the origin of the present, becomes the origin as future, and therefore telos. ... We shall describe the fundamental operation of the outlined dialectic as that operation whereby, in the present, the past reverts into the future.” 168 We would do bet- ter, then, to conceive of the present time as a field that is always in the making through retention of what has passed and protention of what is coming. 169 “The further an experience proceeds,” wrote Husserl, “the more it inherently supports more differentiated protentions, ‘the style of the past becomes pro- jected into the future.’ . . . The course of the retentional branches (or the pres- Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 25 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 25"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"ent intentional content of the retentional branch) influences protention, deter- mining its content, and prescribes its sense.” 170 The field of time is unified in the protentional relation between past and future, the meeting of our expectations in the fulfillment of what has already been what is yet to come. In Husserl’s words, “Every retentional momentary continuity contains a protention directed to the following [retained stretch] and, in continuous mediation, is directed to those [retained stretches] that fol- low. Genetically put: when, again and again, continually new core data appear, the old do not just sink down retentionally; rather a protentional consciousness ‘grows,’ which advances towards the new primary data and, terminating with them, fulfills itself.” 171 As Pierre Keller correctly observed, “Husserl’s theory of time-consciousness not only attempts to mediate between the alternatives of thinking of temporal experience as consisting of intervals or of moments. It also combines an account of temporal experience, and indeed of time itself, as a temporal becoming of successively real past, present, and future experiences with an account of time that bases the structure of time in tenseless relations between events.” 172 The flux of consciousness, which cannot be known except through the consciousness of flux, exemplifies a unity of retentional, impres- sional, and protentional activities, which correspond to three phases of time. 173 The inherently temporal comportment of consciousness renders the constitutive process of imagining time genetic in its composition. 174 The province of music supplies a metaphor suitable to capture the dual inten- tionality of the stream of consciousness and its correlation with the movement of time. 175 Thus, in his 1905 lectures on the phenomenology of internal time- consciousness, which were compiled and published by Heidegger, his former student, 176 in 1928, Husserl wrote: When we speak of the analysis of time-consciousness, of the temporal character of objects of perception, memory, and expectation, it may seem, to be sure, as if we assume the Objective flow of time, and then really study only the subjective condi- tions of the possibility of an intuition of time and a true knowledge of time. What we accept, however, is not the existence of a world-time, the existence of a con- crete duration, and the like, but time and duration appearing as such. . . . To be sure, we also assume an existing time; this, however, is not the time of the world of experience but the immanent time of the flow of consciousness. The evidence that consciousness of a tonal process, a melody, exhibits a succession even as I hear it is such as to make every doubt or denial appear senseless. 177 The flow of internal time-consciousness is described as a “tonal process,” for the arrangement of notes in a melody provides an apt image to portray the suc- Chapter One 26 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 26"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"cession of moments that cohere as a continuous stream, each moment wedged between past anticipation and future retention, a present understood as the ex- pectation that lingers in the lingering of expectation. Identity is spun from the web of momentous experiences, that is, experiences lived in and of the mo- ment, enduring in their passing. “I-am . . . is as ‘I am’ in the living streaming, and this is a streaming having present and the streaming present itself.” Consciousness of self, expressed by the egological utterance par excellence, “I am,” is constituted by/in the course of immanent time, and thus it is described metaphorically in the threefold manner, “living stream,” “streaming having present,” and “streaming present itself.” The stream of time interminably streams forth in consciousness, or more precisely, the stream of time that inter- minably streams forth is consciousness. Making-present (Gegenwärtigen) , present- ing (Präsentieren) , appresence, that is, the possibility of “bringing the object, in con- tinuous original perceptions, to primal presence,” is the temporalizing (Zeitgung) that lies at the base of intentional consciousness. 178 Inner-time is thus privileged phenomenologically, for through it the world- structure in both its spatial and temporal dimensions is constituted. Consider, for example, the distinction between “immanent time” and “objective time” offered by Husserl in his account of the temporalization of the psychic: Pure consciousness is a genuine temporal field, a field of “phenomenological” time. This must not be confused with “Objective” time, which is constituted, along with nature, by consciousness. It is through the psychic apprehension that the conscious lived experiences obtain the sense of psychophysical states and consequently their insertion into Objective time, the form of Objective nature; to localization corre- sponds temporalization. Since phenomenological time, immanent in the stream of consciousness, is a uni-dimensional “constant” manifold of properties that are exactly analogous to the properties of the time which presents itself (“appears”) in the lived experiences of the perception of something physical and “corresponds” to the latter point for point, and since in this appearing time in the ultimate Objec- tivation the “absolute” world-time manifests itself, so the temporalization of the time of consciousness is an especially deep one, insofar as the latter perfectly coin- cides, in a certain way, with absolute time. 179 In contrast to the view (traceable to Aristotle) that time is to be measured as a series of isolated, interchangeable now-points, Husserlian phenomenology (in consonance with the philosophy of William James) 180 envisions the conscious- ness of time as a stream whose flow “is not a mere ‘one after the other,’ but rather a ‘one out of the other,’ a becoming according to laws of a necessary sequence.” 181 For Husserl, the unique character of temporality lies in the inten- Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 27 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 27"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"tional act of making-present, appresenting, re/presenting the present. However, the present, punctilious though it may seem, cannot present itself without the continuum that extends from past to future. Memory and anticipation are nec- essary structural elements of the stream of consciousness, for representation is not possible without retrospection and expectation. “In the impressional momentary field,” wrote Husserl, “we have the unities that crystallize and achieve prominence through particular simultaneous mergings, those [unities] that in the streaming, between the streaming [up] and streaming away, con- cretely continue to endure as the duration continually ‘builds up’ or constitutes impressional (perceptual) unities. The constitution of a unity signifies the con- stitution of a persisting present in the streaming.” 182 Time as it appears, that is, the temporal experience of temporality, embraces the paradox that only that which endures changes and only that which changes endures. “The tone and every time-point in the unity of the enduring tone certainly does have its absolutely fixed position in ‘objective’ (even if immanent) time. Time is fixed, and yet time flows. In the flow of time, in the continuous sinking down into the past, a nonflowing, absolutely fixed, identical, objective time becomes consti- tuted.” 183 I note, parenthetically, that a similar view was expressed by Hermann Weyl, a substantially less-known German phenomenologist whose work was familiar to Husserl, with whom he exchanged some letters. 184 Distinguishing between time as the “original form of the stream of consciousness” and space as the “form of material reality,” Weyl noted that the “contents of conscious- ness present themselves not as merely being . . . but as being-now, filling the form of the enduring now with a continually changing content. When in reflection we tear ourselves out of the stream and posit its content as an object over against us, the stream becomes for us a temporal flow whose individual phases are related to one another according to the relation earlier and later. ” 185 At this juncture, let me cite Husserl’s own summation of the lecture on the “exclusion of objective time” as a way of presenting his notion of internal time- consciousness succinctly: “Phenomenologically speaking, Objectivity is not even constituted through ‘primary’ content but through characters of apprehension and the regularities which pertain to the essence of these characters. It is pre- cisely the business of the phenomenology of cognition to grasp this fully and to make it completely intelligible.” 186 As Husserl put it in a manuscript entry dated March 1931 from what is known as the C-series: the “proto-condition” for the sense of being attributed to everything that exists is the “I-am,” that is, the “liv- ing streaming” of the transcendental ego, a “streaming having-present” that is the “streaming present itself.” This wakeful “I” is not an abstract subject but a “living actuality” that perforce includes the “all-encompassing world-structure.” The “concrete being of the I . . . is living temporalization with the I-pole . . . and Chapter One 28 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 28"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"what is proper to it at that level is inseparably one with that which is first exis- tent for it primarily, with the temporalized as such, or with the living tempor- alization in which the temporalized is unitarily constituted.” The “proto- livingness” is thus a “continual temporalization . . . by which all and everything that is this-moment present [das aktuelle Gegenwärtige] for me, is; but that must be correctly understood and delimited. The world that is there for me, as in the way it holds for me now, is in the now, in a temporalization that belongs to the living present.” 187 The primary task of the phenomenological method is to elucidate the man- ner in which objects of experience are continually constituted by characters of apprehension, ideal essences that inhere in the conscious I-pole. Making- present, appresenting, relates precisely to the cognitive ability of human con- sciousness to instantiate atemporal ideals through the temporal variance of intentional acts. Husserl identified this as the psychic apprehension—perhaps “attunement” would be the better word—of internal time that makes possible the constitution of objective time. 188 The latter is correlated with localization in space, the former with temporalization in consciousness. It follows (contra some interpreters of Husserl, including Derrida to whom I refer above) that spa- tiality assumes a secondary and derivative status vis-à-vis temporality. 189 Husserl’s view is reminiscent of the stance taken by Schelling—and rea‹rmed by the early Heidegger, as will be seen shortly. Schelling, in dialogue with Kant, 190 a‹rms that space and time are the “necessary conditions for all intu- ition,” one being imperceptible without the other. Although space and time cannot be severed phenomenally — space without time would be extension without limitation and time without space would be limitation without exten- sion—logically, it is possible to conceive of limitation without extension, but not the reverse, and hence priority is bestowed on time as determinative of the borders and contours of space, 191 a position that accords with Kant’s designation of time, not space, as the “universal pure intuition” that is the “ a priori formal condition of all appearances.” 192 In Erfahrung und Urteil (1938), Husserl a‹rms a comparable position, albeit in a different terminological and conceptual register. Two kinds of horizon can be distinguished for everything given in experience, a first level, which is the “internal horizon,” and the second level, which is “an infinite, open, external horizon of objects cogiven . . . all real things which at any given time are antic- ipated together or cogiven only in the background as an external horizon are known as real objects . . . from the world, are known as existing within the one spatiotemporal horizon.” 193 The hyphenated demarcation of the external hori- zon as “spatiotemporal” underscores Husserl’s discernment that the two cannot be separated in lived experience. As Husserl puts it in another passage from this Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 29 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 29"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"work, “The world, every possible world, is the universe of realities, among which we count all objects individualized in spatiotemporality, as the form of the world, by their spatiotemporal localization.” 194 The essential inseparability of the spatial and temporal notwithstanding, Husserl seems to privilege the lat- ter in its tripartite intentionality as the phenomenological ground of the inten- tional structure of human consciousness: “In this unique world, everything sensuous that I now originally perceive, everything that I have perceived and which I can now remember or about which others can now remember or about which others can report to me as what they have perceived or remembered, has its place. Everything has its unity in that it has its fixed temporal position in this objective world, its place in objective time.” 195 The emplacement in time does not bespeak the spatialization of the temporal but rather the temporalization of the spatial. Being-There/Insi(gh)ting the Moment Husserl’s perspective was elaborated upon and modified by Heidegger in his existential-analytic inquiry on time and space in Sein und Zeit (1927). The “spe- cific spatiality” of Dasein (being-there, the technical expression for human exis- tence) “must be grounded in temporality” inasmuch as the “constitution of Da- sein and its modes of being are ontologically possible only on the basis of temporality.” 196 In Die Grundsprobleme der Phänomenologie, based on lectures delivered the same year as the publication of Sein und Zeit, Heidegger, betraying his indebt- edness to Nietzsche’s critique of traditional Western metaphysics and its implicit resentment of time, 197 characterizes the essential nature of temporality by noting that the “ ontological condition of the possibility of understanding of being is temporality itself. ... Temporality takes over the enabling of the understanding of being and thus the enabling of the thematic interpretation of being and of its articulation and manifold ways; it makes ontology possible.” Temporalität, which he contrasts with Zeitlichkeit, 198 represents the determinative factor in how human beings inhabit and experi- ence the world, a major component of Heidegger’s phenomenological ontol- ogy: “It [Temporalität] means temporality insofar as temporality itself is made into a theme as the condition of the possibility of the understanding of being and of ontology as such. The term ‘Temporality’ is intended to indicate that temporality, in existential analytic, represents the horizon from which we understand being.” 199 As the title Sein und Zeit clearly indicates, Heidegger gave temporality priority of place in his hermeneutical project of thinking about being from the perspec- tive of time. His choice marks a decisive shift from the phenomenological focus on time-consciousness to an ontological assumption regarding the temporal Chapter One 30 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 30"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"character of human existence. The temporalizing character of human experi- ence, therefore, is not a consequence of the intentional structure of conscious- ness, as Husserl insisted; rather, it indicates the prenoetic manner in which human beings are ontologically situated in the world. 200 Yet in spite of this cru- cial shift, Heidegger, like Husserl, emphasizes time as the distinguishing feature of the human comportment. Recently, Alejandro Vallega has made an impres- sive attempt to consider more seriously the “figure of spatiality as a decon- structive element in Heidegger’s discourse on temporality,” that is, to view the experience of space as the “decisive interruption (Ent-scheidung) of thought’s claim to metaphysical and transcendental principles as the ground and root of the question of being that this very question will begin to be experienced in its alterity.” 201 The marginality of space accords it special significance as it “punc- tuates the development or delimitation of Heidegger’s discourse on temporal- ity. Throughout Heidegger’s book spatiality appears as a constant aporetic ele- ment in his discourse, which ultimately proves to be insurmountable. Spatiality appears not only explicitly and thematically, but also implicitly through various interruptions of the main discourse that point to di‹culties that later will lead Heidegger to abandon his attempt in Being and Time to articulate spatiality in terms of the essential temporality of the question of being.” Spatiality thus “appears as an exilic figure in the discourse on temporality, and at the same time, when engaged, it indicates issues beyond that discourse. In light of the character of spatiality as a figure of alterity and exilic thought, the alterity of the question of being in Being and Time and the exilic character of that thought are made apparent by remaining with Heidegger’s struggle for the question of being in his di‹culties with spatiality.” 202 There is much to commend in Vallega’s study; he has opened up a hitherto untrodden pathway into the thicket of Heidegger’s thinking, a pathway that takes seriously the conception of space as the enactment of alterity—the dis- ruption that opens thought to its own other. Notwithstanding the welcomed contribution and achievement of this approach, I would contend that time remains the privileged mode of experience in Heidegger’s understanding of Dasein’s way of being in the world because it is from this vantage point that the world-structure in its temporal-spatial magnitude is constituted. Consider Vallega’s own remark: “The issues of alterity and exilic thought are figured by the moments of suspension, interruption, and indeterminacy that punctuate the discussions of spatiality.” 203 The untimely use of a temporal metaphor, no doubt an inadvertent slip of the pen, points to the di‹culty for one engaged in Heidegger’s thought in overcoming the bias toward the interpretation of time as the ecstatic-horizon of our understanding of being. As Heidegger put it in his notes for the lecture series “Geschichte des Zeitbegriffs,” delivered at the Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 31 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 31"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"University of Marburg during the summer semester of 1925, human existence finds its ontological grounding in the “phenomenon of the presence of what is of concern in the authentic sense, to the analysis of being-in-the-world in its particular sense as concern, which has the mode of being of pure letting-become- present —a remarkable kind of being which is understood only when it is seen that this making present and appresenting is nothing other than time itself. ” 204 The proximity to Husserl’s language is obvious: the essential feature of time is making-present, or appresenting. 205 Heidegger, however, reframes the discussion by relating the phenomenon of presence to the disposition of concern or care (Sorge) , which he thematizes in Sein und Zeit as existentiality, facticity, and falling prey, the three- fold structure fundamental to the way of being of Dasein. 206 In Vom Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit: Einleitung in die Philosophie, a text first published in 1982 but based on a lecture course delivered at the University of Freiburg in the summer of 1930, Heidegger wrote again of the “primordial connection be- tween being and time.” He identified time as the light that illumines being and allows it to be understood as “constant presence,” the self-contained ecstasis of each instant, the present-at-hand, an occasionalist challenge to the conception of time as a continuously flowing sequence of now-points. 207 The fundamental question of philosophy, therefore, is “ what is the essence of time, such that it grounds being, and such that the question of being as the leading question of metaphysics can and must be unfolded within this horizon? ... The schema for this perspective has come into view: being and time—time—constant presence—being—beings as such—positive freedom.” The focus of the fundamental question is on the “and” in the formula “being and time.” Heidegger is of the view that in this case the conjunction does not signify an “external relation which merely juxtaposes two things,” but it points to a “primordial relation” that “must originate equiprimordially from the essence of being and the essence of time.” Hence, we may conclude that being and time are interwoven with one another. “ The ‘and’ signifies a primordial co- belongingness of being and time from the ground of their existence. ” 208 Although Heidegger acknowledges that when we inquire into time, we generally inquire as well into the nature of space, he still maintains that time is indicative of being in a man- ner not replicated by space. Drawing on traditional philosophical treatments of time — he specifically mentions Aristotle, Augustine, and Kant — Heidegger marks the distinctiveness of time in terms of the fact the human subject is the locus of time. From this he concludes that an inquiry into the essence of time is necessarily an inquiry into the essence of the human being. “ The fundamental ques- tion concerning being and time forces us into the question concerning the human being. ... When the problematic of being and time forces us to the question of man, we inquire into man not just as a being within the multiplicity of beings, but into man inso- far as time—the ground of the most radicalized ontological problem—belongs to man. ” 209 Chapter One 32 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 32"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"In “Zeit und Sein,”a lecture delivered at a later stage in his career, Heidegger acknowledged that the attempt in Sein und Zeit “to derive human spatiality from temporality is untenable.” He opted instead to comprehend Being (for which he uses the technical term ereignis, “appropriation” or “enowning”) as the extend- ing of time-space (das Reichen von Zeit-Raum) . 210 In his post-phenomenological ontology, “time-space” is Heidegger’s term for the Abgrund, the ground attained by leaping (das Sich-den-Grund-erspringen) , 211 the originary leap (Ur-sprung) , the inception and initiation (Anfang) , as opposed to the beginning (Beginn) wherein time and space transpire in their calculatedly represented a‹liation. 212 In Beiträge zur Philosophie (Vom Ereignis) , written between 1936 and 1938, Heidegger stretched the limits of language when he described time-space as “arising from and belonging to the essential sway of truth [entspringend aus dem und gehörig zu dem Wesen der Wahrheit] , as the grounded jointure of removal- and charming-moving-unto (joining) of the t/here [als das so gegründete Entrückungs-Berückungsgefüge (Fügung) des Da] .... The site for the moment and the strife of world and earth. The strife and sheltering of the truth of enowning.” 213 The translators have sensibly rendered dem Wesen der Wahrheit as “the essential sway of truth.” The continuation of the sentence, however, defies precise translation, as the poetic flourish of Heidegger’s rhetoric overflows the vessels of the German language he sum- moned and was summoned by, als das so gegründete Entrückungs-Berückungsgefüge (Fügung) des Da. Time-space lays the ground of Dasein’s relationship to being by way of the “strife and sheltering of the truth of enowning” (Der Streit und die Bergung der Wahrheit des Ereignisses). Strife and sheltering, words juxtaposed by way of opposition, 214 convey coming-together in pulling-apart, drawing a bound- ary in the giving/withholding of the fourfold (Geviert) , the rebuff of strife that enframes the sheltering of embrace. 215 The originary swerve on the path, the “essential sway of truth,” is described in words that conjure images of enrapture (Entrücken) and enchantment (Be- rückung) , the fate/decree of “there” to which Dasein must submit. In the incep- tual opening-closure, ever about to transpire, time-space is experienced as the “site for the moment” (Augenblicksstätte) , a locution that is not meant to convey the dependence of time on space, but rather the conjunction of temporality and spa- tiality in their separateness. To be/hold the site of the moment marks the “uniqueness of Da-sein” in belonging to truth as the “essential enswaying of being as enowning” (der Erwesung des Seins als Ereignis) , the “enowned encleavage of the turning between belongingness and the call, between abandonment by being and enbeckoning.” In the “hidden essential sway of time-space,” Dasein discerns the “enquivering of the resonance of be-ing itself” (das Erzittern der Schwingung des Seyns selbst) . 216 Time-space is the ab-ground, the foundation that is the “inbetween of the turning” (das Inzwischen der Kehre) , the “inabiding” (inständ- Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 33 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 33"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"liches) , which is “determined as the now and the here,” the “ originary onefold (urp- srüngliche Einheit) of space and time, that unifying onefold that above all lets them go apart into their separatedness.” 217 Time-space is the “originary essential swaying of ground” (die urpsrüngliche Wesung des Grundes) , whence temporal and spatial are dispatched in the difference of their sameness. The ab -ground, for Heidegger, is the ab- ground, 218 that is, that which is “ of the ground” comes forth as going away “from the ground, ” a grounding that does not ground except as the “hesitating refusal of ground” (die zögernde Versagung des Grundes) , an encompassing that brings into the open the enopening that holds sway, the keeping-together of what is to be broken-apart, the abiding of the ephemeral, the “self-sheltering- concealing in the manner of not-granting the ground” by “letting be un- fulfilled,” “letting be empty,” the “initial openness” (erst Offene) of the “originary emptiness” (urpsrüngliche Leere) whereby “what is ownmost to truth” is enopened in the “belongingness of time-space,” “en- ownment, be-ing itself.” Time’s Becoming/Identity of Indifference To do justice to Heidegger’s Abgrund, particularly its implications for the concep- tion of temporality, one would do well to take into account the notion of the Ungrund in Schelling’s philosophical treatises, a term he apparently appropriated from Jacob Böhme’s mystical theosophy, which is related, in turn, to the Abgrund, or abyss, of Meister Eckhart. 219 In Schelling’s post-Identity-Philosophy, the “un- ground” designates the dark abyss whence God gives birth to himself as light, 220 the “original ground” that is “ before all ground and before all existence, thus before any duality at all. . . . Since it precedes all opposites, these cannot be dif- ferentiated within it or be in any way present in it. Thus it cannot be designated as the identity of opposites, but only as their absolute indifference. ” The critical notion of indifference (Indifferenz) implies that “all opposites are broken, which is nothing other than their very non-being, and which therefore has no predicate except predicatelessness, without therefore being a nothing or an absurdity.” 221 Schelling’s objective was to maintain a sense of difference by a‹rming the unity of identity and indifference, 222 that is, a unity that embraces the disjunction of opposites coexisting as non-opposites. In Schelling’s own words, “Real and ideal, darkness and light, or however else we wish to designate the two principles, can never be predicated of the unground as opposites. But nothing hinders their being predicated of it as non-opposites, i.e., in disjunction and each for itself; whereby, however, this very duality (the actual twofoldness of the principles) is posited.” 223 God is the “nonground” (Ungrund) as the “absence of ground” (Ab- grund) , a state that is prior to all opposition and even beyond the overcoming of opposition; it is this quality that merits the term “absolute indifference.” 224 Chapter One 34 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 34"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The characterization of the Ungrund most relevant to the present analysis is elaborated in the third version of Die Weltalter (1815) in the portrayal of the “eternal life of the Godhead,” the “absolute” and “primordial being,” as a conflict between two equally primal forces, the negative and positive. This “eternal antithesis,” Schelling notes, is di‹cult to verbalize and to conceive sci- entifically, but it may be cast in a number of images, to wit, necessity and free- dom, withholding and outpouring, love and wrath, leniency and strictness, retreat into selfhood (die Selbstheit) and self-giving egoity (die Egoität) . 225 The absolute is not configured as a dissolution of opposites (or, in the celebrated language of Nicholas of Cusa, coincidentia oppositorum ) 226 but rather as their per- petuation, for divine individuality (göttlichen Individualität) is not possible without dividuality (Dividualität) . 227 Hence, the primal being, the unground that precedes all ground, is characterized as a composite of dual forces that remain distinct, “a doubling (Doppelheit) that . . . appears to us as light and darkness, masculine and feminine, spiritual and corporeal. Therefore, the oldest teachings straightfor- wardly represented the first nature as a being with two conflicting modes of activity.” 228 To say of the divine essence that it is simultaneously negative and positive is not to conflate the two to the point that difference is effaced, but rather to embrace the nonduality of oppositional forces, the indifference—a state of “nondivorce” (Ungeschiedenheit) that is not free from all difference but rather negates it (nicht eine von aller Differenz freie, sondern eine sie verneinende) 229 — through which difference is preserved. 230 “For since God is not the cause of the Other through a special volition but through God’s mere essence, the Other is certainly not the essence of God, but it belongs to God’s essence, indeed, in a natural and inseparable way. It therefore follows that if the pure Godhead = A, and that the Other = B, then the full concept of the living Godhead which has being is not merely A, but is A + B.” 231 It may very well be that the rubric “oldest teachings” (ältesten Lehren) men- tioned by Schelling refers to the secret gnosis of kabbalah, even though the pri- mary conduit of this doctrine would have likely been Böhme’s account of the Ungrund, the self-enfolding God, as both Nichts (nothing) and Alles (everything), the single will in which all creation lies, the eternal one beyond the polarities of love and anger, light and darkness. 232 A comprehensive examination of the influence of kabbalistic doctrine on Schelling is beyond the scope of this chap- ter, 233 but su‹ce it to say that he drew from the wellsprings of Jewish esoteric lore—either directly from a compilation of material translated by Christian Knorr von Rosenroth in Kabbala Denudata (Sulzbach 1677–1684) 234 or through secondary channels like Friedrich Christoph Oetinger 235 — to formulate his logic of identity and indifference, the absolute unity that arises from the belonging together (Zusammengehörigkeit) of two oppositional forces in a third that sustains Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 35 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 35"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"rather than obliterates dichotomy. 236 The interrelationship of two discrete qual- ities yields the indifference that facilitates difference of identity (A + B) as opposed to identity of difference (A = B). In the theosophic symbolism adopted by kabbalists, God is characterized as balancing two major attributes, the out- pouring hand of mercy on the right and the constricting hand of judgment on the left, the masculine impulsion to overflow and the feminine capacity to receive. God’s becoming, and the nature of being that may be adduced there- from, is measured by this balance, a harmony that preserves opposites in their opposition. In the thirteenth century kabbalists were already employing the term hash- wa’ah, which, as Gershom Scholem noted, corresponds to the Latin indistinctio or aequalitas, and the related hashwa’at ha-a h dut, “equanimous one,” to describe the lack of differentiation—or what we might call the indifference of opposites— in Ein Sof, or in the will, identified as the primary gradation Keter or Ayin, that is coeternal with it. 237 Analogously, Schelling describes the unity of the first being as “one and the same, that is the a‹rmation and the negation, that which pours out and that which holds on .... Precisely that which is set in opposition can only be essentially and, so to speak, personally, ‘one,’ insofar as it is only the individual nature of the person that is able to unite that which is in conflict.” 238 The absolute can be encrypted as “one and the same = x” insofar as it is the case that “A = x” and “B = x,” whence follows “A and B are one and the same,” that is, “both are x.” To say that “both are x,” however, does not entail that there is no difference between the “x” that A is and the “x” that B is; it signifies, rather, that A and B are both “x” to the extent that the “something = x that B is” is not identical to the “something = x that A is.” We may conclude, therefore, that God’s being “is of two different kinds; first the negating force (B) that represses the a‹rmative being (A), positing it as the inwardly passive or as what is hid- den; second, the outstretching, self-communicating being that in clear contrast holds down the negating power in itself and does not let it come outwardly into effect.” 239 Significantly, Schelling contends that the “doctrine of the unity of the divine essence in duality shows itself as profoundly interwoven with what is inner- most, even with the language itself, of the Old Testament.” More specifically, the proof is elicited from the repeated use of the plural name Elohim with verbs in the singular, and from the conjunction of the two names, YHWH and Elohim. Schelling relates this archaic pairing to a distinction between the hidden and manifest dimensions of God, an approach that resonates with kabbalists’ distinction between Ein Sof and the sefirot. 240 “YHWH,” whose true pronuncia- tion is unknown, consisting as it does of the “pure, so-called silent letters” (lauter sogenannten ruhenden Buchstaben; literis quiescentibus) , is the “name of the essence” that Chapter One 36 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 36"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"is “pure breath,” “pure spirit, or “pure will without actual conation,” whereas “Elohim” is the “name of the divine effects,” the multifaceted manifestation of that essence, spirit, and will. 241 The kabbalistic influence on Schelling is even more conspicuous in his obser- vation regarding the interchangeability of the angelic figure—the “angel of the countenance,” mal’akh ha-panim (der Engel des Angesichts) or the “angel of the Lord,” mal’akh yhwh (der Engel Jehovahs) 242 — and the divine essence. 243 Focusing exegeti- cally on the theophany of God to Moses at/in the burning bush (Exod 3:2 ff.), Schelling notes “according to the understanding of the narrator, the angel of the countenance is also Jehovah, yet both are still distinct. The meaning of the nar- ration is perhaps just that Moses was deemed worthy of a vision of that highest vitality, of that inner consuming yet always again reviving (and in this respect not consuming) fire that is the nature of the Godhead.” 244 The obfuscation of the ontic boundary between angel and God, centered about the image of the glorious angel and/or angelic glory, is a fundamental tenet of kabbalah—in its varied formulations—with roots in much older forms of Jewish esotericism that may have served as the model for the binitarian pattern of devotion appar- ent in early Christian communities that ascribed to Jesus the role of the chief mediating agent. 245 For Schelling, the intentional confusion in Scripture is proof of the logic of A + B applied to the Godhead, that is, to speak of—to imagine— the divine essence requires envisioning the essence and the other that comes through that essence but is not identical to it, an ontotheological truth that lies beyond and is the foundation of the Christological myth of three persons in the one substance of God. In line with those who viewed kabbalah as a repository of Jewish doctrine that confirms Christian belief, a strategy that gained particu- lar currency in Renaissance Humanist and Neoplatonist circles advocating a prisca theologia, Schelling adduces the trinitarian dogma on the basis of a dyad derived from the mythologic of kabbalistic symbolism. In consonance with the theosophy of Böhme, Schelling maintains that the Godhead is a “whole and undivided” unity comprising the “eternal Yes” and “eternal No,” and thus it is improper to privilege one member of the antinom- ical pair over the other. 246 Nevertheless, it is evident that Schelling ascribes pri- ority to the negating force as the primal phase of divine autogenesis, the “initi- ating power” that is the “unconditioned and absolutely first beginning.” 247 It is with regard to this issue that Schelling’s probable indebtedness to kabbalah, and especially to the teachings of Luria, is perhaps most conspicuous. In language that resonates with kabbalistic symbolism, based in turn on an earlier aggadic motif regarding the primacy of judgment vis-à-vis mercy in the creation of the world, 248 Schelling states explicitly that in the Godhead might precedes leniency, stringency precedes gentleness, and wrath precedes love. 249 Moreover, Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 37 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 37"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"in an even more precise analogue to the kabbalistic myth of s im s um— the pri- mordial withdrawal of the infinite from itself into itself to create the space devoid of itself wherein the emanation of all things in the concatenation of being will unfold 250 — Schelling contends that “what is altogether first in God, in the living God, the eternal beginning of itself in itself, is that God restricts itself, denies itself, withdraws its essence from the outside and retreats into itself.” 251 The primary gesture of God is an “originary negation” (ursprüngliche Vernei- nung) , 252 an act of severity, exclusivity, and intolerance that Schelling associates with the “jealous Jewish God,” 253 a withdrawing that exposes what remains withdrawn, a concealment that facilitates disclosure. 254 “The now active negat- ing potency is the force (i.e., the possibility) of positing the a‹rming potency .... For God is precisely in that God does not have being. God is only as not having being, in the state of involution (implicite, in statu involutionis) , which is a transport (intermediary) of real revelation.” 255 Just as Böhme (in an uncanny similarity to kabbalistic theosophy) had argued that the “great expansiveness without limit desires a narrowness and a comprehension (Einfasslichkeit) by which it might reveal itself” and thus “there must be a contraction and a clos- ing in from which the revelation may shine,” 256 Schelling maintains that the “ground of revelation” is “that which negates all revelation.” 257 Responding to the view that God is a “self-revelatory being” (ens manifestativum sui) , a stance that is the mythic basis for his own theogonic speculations, Schelling argues that rev- elation is not the “highest self of the Godhead,” for “something that is free is free precisely in that it does not have to reveal itself.” 258 The initial expression of divine freedom, the “original” and “root” force whence life begins, is not in expansion but in contraction, not in evolution but in involution, not in being seen but in being hidden. 259 “That God negates itself, restricts its being, and withdraws into itself, is the eternal force and might of God. In this manner, the negating force is that which is singularly revealing of God. But the actual being of God is that which is concealed.” 260 The mystery of occlusion, according to Schelling, is alluded to in the biblical image of God concealing his counte- nance. 261 Yet, from another perspective, the receding must be seen as an expres- sion of advancing, the judgment a manifestation of love. “The decision to reveal itself and to posit itself superably as the eternal No was one and the same deci- sion. Hence, just as this decision is a work of the highest freedom, it is also a work of the highest Love .... Priority is in inverse to superiority.” 262 We find exactly the same logic at work in the relevant kabbalistic sources: the first act is one of judgmental contraction (an idea rendered by a number of mythical images, including the kings of Edom who reigned ahead of the kings of Israel, the worlds destroyed that preceded the created world, the shell that emerged Chapter One 38 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 38"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"before the fruit), but when understood dialectically, it is a manifestation of mer- ciful expansion; thus what is temporally prior is ontically subordinate. Utilizing a distinction attributed to Plutarch, Schelling describes the Godhead—or what he calls in one passage the Super-Godhead (Übergottheit) 263 — as the “being that has no being” (nicht seyend seyn) , to be differentiated from the being that is “non-being” (nicht Seyn) . 264 Commenting on a statement from De cherubinische Wandersmann by Johann Sche›er, known as Angelus Silesius (1624– 1677), “The gentle Godhead is nothing and beyond nothing” (Die zarte Gottheit ist das Nichts und Übernichts) , Schelling writes that the “Godhead is nothing because nothing can come toward it in a way distinct from its being and, again, it is above all nothingness because it itself is everything.” 265 To speak of the Godhead as nothing is to equate it with “pure freedom” (lautere Freiheit) , which Schelling further characterizes as the “will that wills nothing, that desires no object, for which all things are equal and is therefore moved by none of them.” Of this will we can say both that it is nothing, for “it neither desires to become actual itself nor wants any kind of actuality,” and that it is everything, for it is the “eternal freedom” that “rules everything, and is ruled by nothing.” 266 In an apparently contradictory claim, Schelling delineates the primal being as “self-wanting” [sich-Wollen] , but, as he is quick to point out, “wanting oneself (Sich wollen) and negating oneself as having being [Sich verneinen als Seyend] is [ sic ] one and the same.” 267 If “wanting oneself” and “negating oneself as having being” are iden- tical, it follows that the two portrayals of the Godhead are not conflicting, that is, the highest of desires is the desire that has no object (der seine Sache begehrt) and the strongest of wills, the will that wills nothing (der Wille, der nichts will) . Similar representations of the infinite will are widely attested in the theo- sophic ruminations of thirteenth-century kabbalists — for instance, Azriel of Gerona, Jacob ben Sheshet, Isaac Ibn Latif, Moses de León, and other Castilian figures whose views are preserved in zoharic homilies, and the many subse- quent authors influenced thereby, including Luria and his disciples. 268 Keter, the “supernal will,” the aura that is coextensive with and hence ontically insepara- ble—even if distinguishable—from Ein Sof, 269 is also characterized as “noth- ing” (ayin) , 270 a designation that denotes not lack but surplus of being that is beyond comprehension, the “pure ether that cannot be apprehended.” 271 The nature of that primordial will is to will naught but itself, which is to say, to will nothing; but to will nothing is to have nothing to will, a double negation that results in the emanation of the sefirot hidden in the will. 272 The plentitude of the infinite finds its fullest expression in the emptying of the will rather than its overflowing, retreating into the nothing it is (not), inhalation preceding exha- lation, enfolding beginning every unfolding, 273 the mystical One that is so full that it is empty, so empty that it is full, the paradoxical identity of the plenum Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 39 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 39"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"and vacuum. 274 Thus, Schelling concludes, “actual power lies more in delimi- tation than expansion and that to withdraw oneself has more to do with might than to give oneself.” 275 This conclusion resonates with another aspect of Lurianic teaching that is cap- tured by the technical term sha ‘ ashu ‘ a, which suggests that the primal act of con- traction on the part of the unlimited is a form of self-arousal or bemusement (both sexual and noetic in intent), a process I have explored elsewhere under the rubric “suffering and the jouissance of becoming-other.” 276 In rhetoric remarkably similar to kabbalistic sources, Schelling comprehends the initial stir- ring in the Godhead in terms of the desire to become oneself, which is con- comitantly suffering for the sake of the other. “Suffering is universal, not only with respect to humanity, but also with respect to the creator. . . . Because all living things must first involve themselves in Being and break out of the dark- ness to transfiguration, so, too, in its revelation, the divine being must first assume nature and, as such, suffer it, before it can celebrate the triumph of its liberation.” 277 For kabbalists, the primal suffering is connected to the archaic sapiential image of God taking delight in his wisdom prior to creation, an idea a‹rmed by Schelling in response to the question of what God was doing before the world was created: “Scriptures tell in what cozy proximity wisdom already was in and around God in those primordial times. As such, wisdom was God’s favorite and found herself in the sweetest feeling of bliss, but was also the cause of God’s joy, since at that time He beheld, in advance and through Her, the entire future history, the great image of the world and all of the events in nature and in the realm of spirits.” 278 Admittedly, there is no mention of suffering in this passage, but it is obvious that what Schelling is describing is the activity of the divine in the “primordial times” (Urzeiten) of eternity, the stirring of the will in its purest freedom to manifest itself in nature and thus become actual. This self-manifestation is precisely what Schelling intends in the text just cited, in which he explicitly applies suffering to God’s revelation. 279 The path of Schelling’s thought culminates in the paradox of self-negation that marks the “first beginning” (erste Anfang) , the beginning that has no begin- ning and hence no end, the ground that never begins and thus never ceases being the beginning. 280 Placing the negating force that “is its own precisely in negation” 281 at the beginning leads to a deconstruction—or, in Schelling’s own terms, a sublimation—of the very concept of beginning and end, which, by implication, challenges the linear conception of time from past to future as well as the hierarchical alignment of space from top to bottom. Hence we first attain the consummate concept of that first nature . . . a life that eter- nally circulates within itself, a kind of circle because the lowest always runs into the Chapter One 40 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 40"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"highest, and the highest again into the lowest. . . . There is neither a veritable higher nor a veritable lower, since in turn one is the higher and the other is the lower. There is only an unremitting wheel, a rotatory movement that never comes to a standstill and in which there is no differentiation. Even the concept of the begin- ning, as well as the concept of the end, again sublimates itself in this circulation. . . . Since it did not begin sometime but began since all eternity in order never (verita- bly) to end, and ended since all eternity, in order always to begin again, it is clear that that first nature was since all eternity and hence, equiprimordially, a movement circulating within itself, and that this is its true, living concept. 282 Avoiding the extremes of either collapsing the difference between time and eternity or setting them in diametric opposition, Schelling conjures a temporal eternity that is at the same time an eternal temporality. 283 The boundless free- dom of the absolute being expresses itself in the perpetual alteration of the abyssal will within the circle of becoming, the “inner life that incessantly gives birth to itself and again consumes itself. . . . Through that constant retreat to the beginning and the eternal recommencement, it makes itself into substance in the real sense of the word (id quod substat) , into the always abiding. It is the con- stant inner mechanism and clockwork, time, eternally commencing, eternally becoming, always devouring itself and always giving birth to itself.” 284 The freedom of will, insofar as it wills nothing actual, is the “a‹rmative concept of absolute eternity,” and just as “eternal immovability” is the goal of all move- ment, so “all time, even that eternal time, is nothing but the constant obsession with eternity.” 285 There are metaphysicians who advocate a “concept of eternity completely pure of any admixtures of temporal concepts,” but this is an eternity that is “as nothing.” To speak of an “actual, living eternity” (wirklichen lebendigen Ewigkeit) requires one to posit a “constant Now [ beständiges Nun]) , an eternal pres- ent [ewige Gegenwart] .” 286 In this moment, eternally present yet not fully dis- closed—the “nonpresent” (Nichtgegenwart) in Schelling’s language—for if fully disclosed it would not be the eternally present moment on its way to becom- ing, time and eternity are held together in the identity of their indifference, “time coexisting with eternity.” 287 “Just as there is no other concept for time other than the counterplay of eternity, there is also no other concept (for eter- nal time) than that it is the eternally nonpresent.” Schelling draws the logical conclusion: “The true eternity does not exclude all time but rather contains time (eternal time) subjugated within itself. Actual eternity is the overcoming of time, as the richly meaningful Hebrew language expresses ‘victory’ (which it posits among the first attributes of God) and ‘eternity’ with a single word (naezach) .” 288 The “overcoming of time” (Überwindung der Zeit) by the “actual eter- nity” (wirkliche Ewigkeit) entails not the dissolution of time but its eternalization.

That he had in mind kabbalistic symbolism is evident from his parenthetical remark that this word is “among the first attributes of God,” a reference to the eighth of the traditional ten sefirot. Schelling also relates the notion of eternity that con- tains time subjugated within itself to the Egyptian theogonic circularity captured in the inscription over the Temple of Sais: “I am the one who was, who is, who will be.” Moreover, following Kant, Schelling associates this inscription with the divine epiphany to Moses (Exod 3:14), which he paraphrases as “I am the one who was, I was who I will be, I will be who I am” (Ich bin, der ich war, Ich war, der ich sehn werde, Ich werde sehn, der ich bin) . 290 For Schelling, we cannot speak of time in God, but we must speak of God in time: This time outside of eternity is that movement of eternal nature where eternal nature, ascending from the lowest, always attains the highest, and, from the high- est, always retreats anew in order to ascend again. Only in this movement does eternal nature discern itself as eternity. The Godhead counts and gauges in this clockwork — not its own eternity (for this is always whole, consummate, indivisi- ble, beyond all time and no more eternal in the succession of all times than in the moment), but rather just the moments of the constant repetition of its eternity, that is, of time itself, which, as Pindar already says, is only the simulacrum of eternity. For eternity must not be thought as those moments of time taken together, but rather as coexisting with each single moment so that eternity again sees only its (whole, immeasurable) self in each single one. 291 In sum, we may conclude that primordial time according to Schelling is the eternal movement of God’s self-becoming; eternity, therefore, is the temporal unfolding of the commutable form. 292 As we shall see, the kabbalists’ portrayal of the infinite’s encircled expansion suggests a similar view. Timespace and Swaying of Ground In modes of discourse still beholden to Schelling, 293 and by implication to the theosophic gnosis espoused in the secrets of kabbalah, yet distinctive of his own poetizing, Heidegger writes of the “ur-ground” that “opens only in ab- ground,” that is, the ground that grounds its being in the holding sway of its truth. 294 Insofar as the ab-ground is a “staying away of ground” (Weg-bleiben des Grundes) , the “primary clearing for what is open as ‘emptiness’ ” (die erste Lichtung Chapter One 42 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 42"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"des Offenen als der “Leere”) , it follows that enowning the ground, an originary attunement that Heidegger refers to as the “engrounding of ground” (die Er- gründung des Grundes) , must “venture a leap into ab-ground and must enfathom and withstand the ab-ground.” 295 To leap into and withstand the ground, to en- fathom the engrounded by engrounding the enfathomed, one must take hold of the ground that is grounded in the staying-away of the ground, the nameless abyss empty of content, the “subsumptive power” that resists the resolution of conflictuality, by appealing to an origin that synthesizes disparate forces. 296 It is the way of the foundation (Abgrund) to be unfathomable (abgründig) , and thus Heidegger’s only recourse for formulating the texture of time-space was to adopt a manner of discourse that, in his own words, lacks “any claim to imme- diate intelligibility” 297 —a form of expression that mimics what is to be ex- pressed, that is, the ab-ground, the “originary clearing” (urpsrüngliche Lichtung) in which the hesitating manifests itself, the “steadfastness of the sheltering that lights up” (das Beständnis der lichtenden Verbergung) , in the gifting of withholding, the concealment of disclosure in the disclosure of concealment. 298 Time-space is the source, the ur-ground, whence time and space break apart into differentiated representations that mark the determination of humankind’s historical destina- tion. 299 The “unfolding of time-space out of the site for the moment” results in the “stretching” of time and space respectively into quantifiable and calculable forms. “Belonging to what is ownmost to truth, both are originarily one in time-space, both render the grounding of the t/here [Da] —a grounding that holds to the abground—a t/here [Da] through which selfhood and all that is true about a being is first grounded.” 300 The shift in orientation (I do not say “phenomenological” for, technically speaking, the abground is not phenome- nalizable) required by Heidegger’s ontological turn is a move from the second- ary representations of time and space as corresponding but essentially distinct modes of perception to the originary attunement of time-space as a coupling of what belongs together by virtue of not belonging together. Rejecting his own earlier attempt to treat spatial demarcation as a form of temporalizing, Heidegger insists that space and time “are not only different in the number of usually meant ‘dimensions,’ but from the ground up each has what is ownmost to it—and only by virtue of this utmost difference do they refer to their origin, time-space. The more purely what is own-ownmost to each is preserved and the deeper the origin lies, the more successful is the grasping of their essential sway as time-space, which belongs to what is own- most to truth as clearing ground for sheltering-concealing.” 301 In speaking of time-space as the source, Heidegger does not have in mind an essential and original truth subject to metaphysical speculation 302 but the ground of what is “ownmost” to both temporal and spatial delimitation, “the displacing into the Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 43 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 43"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"encompassing open—an open which builds presencing and stability, but with- out becoming experienceable and groundable.” The pathway to the “transi- tional mindfulness” of the ground that is not groundable is not by way of “rep- resenting a general essence” but through the “originary-historical entry into the site for the moment,” a projecting-open into the encompassing-open by means of which one appropriates the “uniqueness and onset of the brightest removal—unto the domain of the hint, out of the gentle charming-moving- unto the self-refusing-hesitating, nearness and remoteness in decision, the ‘where’ and the ‘when’ of being-history, lights up and shelters itself from within enownment of the grounding-attunement of reservedness — this and the basic experience of the t/here and thus of time-place.” 303 To be attuned to time-space, one must enown the site of the moment, an enowning that comes by letting go, a drawing near by moving away, an opening up by closing down, an advancing forward by retrieving behind. In time-space as the essential swaying of truth, the ground that holds its ground, the ab-ground, time and space are named together in inexplicable asso- ciation. In this regard, as I have already intimated, Heidegger’s later thought has moved away from the phenomenological claim of his early work that space is derived from time. Emphasizing the point, Heidegger contrasts timespace (Zeitraum) and time-space (Zeit-Raum) : “What is meant by timespace is a deter- mination of time itself and only of time—and not that grounding essential sway that is originally a one for time and space, as in the word time-space. ” 304 In speak- ing of timespace, the span of time, time is represented as spacious and space as temporal; by contrast, time-space presumes the onefold origin (or originary onefold) of space and time that allows for separation in the manner of tempo- ralizing and spatializing determinations. Notwithstanding the critical turn in his thinking, vestiges of his older view that privileged time are evident in Heidegger’s later compositions. Consider, for instance, the key term “site for the moment,” Augenblicksstätte, which, as noted above, is associated with the experience of the ab-ground. The conjunctive grammatical state implies that we are seeking the site for the moment, not the moment for the site, and hence temporality is primary and spatiality secondary. Furthermore, Heidegger’s description of the “hint” or the “hesitating self- refusal,” which is upheld as the “enopening of what shelters and conceals itself as such,” the “self-enopening for and as enownment, which is also grounding of the human being’s “call to belongingness to enowning itself,” 305 assumes a decidedly temporal as opposed to spatial character: “Self-refusal creates not only the emptiness of deprivation and awaiting but also, along with these, the emptiness as an emptiness that is in itself removing-unto, removing unto futurality and thus at the same time breaking open what has been, which bounces back from Chapter One 44 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 44"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"what is to come and makes up the present as moving into abandonment, but as remembering-awaiting. But because this abandonment is originarily remem- bering-expecting (belongingness to being and to the call of be-ing), it is in itself no mere sinking and dying away in a not-having, but conversely, it is the pres- ent that aims at and is solely carried out into decision: moment. ” 306 In these words, one can detect a hint of a critical component of Heidegger’s notion of temporality that persisted, albeit in constantly changing forms, in the various stages of his thought: the realization that to become present, time must be absent. As Frank Schallow has pointed out, Heidegger realized that this ability of time to defer itself was not “merely an accidental feature of temporality, but rather marked its deeper origin within the polarity of revealing-concealing as the essence of truth. Temporality thereby appears less as a transcendental structure and more as a kinetic event or movement between opposites, the re-enactment of a creative process interchanging end and beginning, consummation and ori- gin.” 307 This conception of temporality is indebted to Schelling’s emphasis on time as “an elliptical rather than a linear process,” a “primeval occurrence” that is not juxtaposed to eternity. Temporality, for Schelling, “provides the interme- diary link through which the possibilities housed in the divine essence can unfold, and these possibilities in turn become concrete when specified within the delimited confines of nature and history.” 308 Time, in short, is the space within which the reconciliation of opposites within the infinite is enacted. The influence of Schelling can be discerned both in Heidegger’s reference to the originary abandonment that takes the form of remembering-awaiting, terms that have a distinctive temporal quality, and in Dasein’s response to the call to belonging, which is occasioned by the retention-expectation of the abandon- ment that is in and of the moment. “The remembering awaiting (remembering a con- cealed belongingness to be-ing, awaiting a call of be-ing) puts to decision the whether or not of the onset of be-ing. More clearly: Temporalizing as this join- ing of (the hesitating) self-refusal grounds the domain of decision, in accord with the ab-ground.” 309 Although Heidegger goes on to speak of the “spatializ- ing of enowning,” which complements the temporalizing, there is no question that he privileges the latter. From this vantage point, one must consider Heidegger’s supposition regarding the conjunction of time and being: “Being as presence, as the present in a still undetermined sense, is characterized by a time- character and thus by time. This gives rise to the supposition that the It which gives Being, which determines Being as presencing and allowing-to-presence, might be found in what is called ‘time’ in the title Time and Being. ” 310 The critical unit of time in the presencing of time-space remains the moment-at-hand; how- ever, this “no longer means merely the distance between two now-points of cal- culated time” but is rather the “name for the openness which opens up in the Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 45 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 45"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"mutual self-extending of futural approach, past and present. This openness exclusively and primarily provides the space in which space as we usually know it can unfold.” 311 Time continues to receive preferential treatment, for the con- vergence of the three temporal modes is what constitutes the prespatial self- extending that provides the space wherein beings are to be disclosed. Temporocentrism/Overcoming Spatial Logic Not surprisingly, there has been recent criticism of the subordination of space to time, or what Edward Casey has called the phenomenon of “temporo- centrism,” that has dominated the “modernist myth” underlying philosophical and scientific conceptions of the cosmos. 312 As a corrective, some thinkers have focused on the primacy of space, rather than time, in the shaping of human per- ception and memory. 313 Gaston Bachelard, for instance, has written: “To local- ize a memory in time is merely a matter for the biographer and only corre- sponds to a sort of external history, for external use, to be communicated to others. But hermeneutics, which is more profound than biography, must deter- mine the centers of fate by ridding history of its conjunctive temporal tissue. . . . For a knowledge of intimacy, localization in the spaces of our intimacy is more urgent than determination of dates.” 314 Casey has more recently a‹rmed Blanchot’s privileging of space in his phe- nomenological study on remembering, although he is careful to distinguish between place and space. The “modern obsession with time” can only be over- come by breaking down the “resistance to place,” which “by virtue of its un- encompassability by anything other than itself” is conceived as the “limit and condition of all that exists.” 315 When examined from this standpoint, it appears that implacement is what makes the passage of time possible. 316 What is remembered is well grounded if it is remembered as being in a particular place — a place that may well take precedence over the time of its occurrence. . . . But precisely where memory is at stake, to be fixed in space is to be fixed in place .... Memory of place implaces us and thus empowers us: gives us space to be precisely because we have been in so many memorable places, enjoyed such intimacy in them, known such pain there as well. If body memory moves us — is the prime mover of our memorial lives — it moves us directly into place, whose very immobility contributes to its distinct potency in matters of memory. 317 In response to the critique of the subordination of the spatial to the tempo- ral, I would counter that the more distinctive character of the postmodern experience may be the reverse, that is, the greatest challenge is to liberate Chapter One 46 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 46"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"time — and ultimately the construction of self that is dependent on temporal demarcations — from its subjugation to an overwhelmingly spatial orienta- tion. 318 Frederic Jameson’s insightful comment is relevant here: The crisis in historicity now dictates a return, in a new way, to the question of temporal organization in general in the postmodern force field, and indeed, to the problem of the form that time, temporality, and the syntagmatic will be able to take in a culture increasingly dominated by space and spatial logic. If, indeed, the subject has lost its capacity actively to extend its pro-tensions and re-tensions across the temporal manifold and to organize its past and future into coherent experience, it becomes di‹cult enough to see how the cultural productions of such a subject could result in anything but “heaps of fragments” and in a practice of the randomly heterogeneous and fragmentary and the aleatory. 319 In the final analysis, we must admit (as physicists would surely insist) that distinctions of time are inconceivable without boundaries of space and bound- aries of space are unimaginable without distinctions of time. 320 Here we would do well to recall Nietzsche’s sagacious and relatively straightforward remark: “It seems to me that the most important faculty is that of perceiving shape, i.e., a fac- ulty based upon mirroring. Space and time are only things which have been measured according to some rhythm.” 321 Spatial and temporal characteristics do not exist in themselves; they arise in consciousness as a result of measuring the interval against some standard—a point that accords with Nietzsche’s view that “knowing is a process of measuring according to a criterion. Without a crite- rion, i.e., without any limitation, there is no knowing.” 322 Our knowledge of the world would not be possible without the limitations imposed by the notions of space and time. Casey himself remarks on the ulti- mate inseparability of these two modalities: “What most merits noticing is that in every instance internal and external horizons are at once spatial and tempo- ral (ultimately, they are spatio-temporal) and that both kinds of horizon are shared by memory and place alike.” 323 Thus, we speak tellingly of an event “taking place,” a common expression that conveys very well the phenomeno- logical insight that a datum of human experience is perceived concomitantly in the venues of time and space. The concurrence of the spatial and temporal is a distinctive feature of Proust’s “experience of time embodied” (l’expérience du temps incorporé) , as Kristeva has ardently insisted: If Time is psychic time, and if it thus affects our bodies, it remains the only imagi- nary value that the novel can offer its community of readers. . . .

By believing that Proust’s novel merely deals with time, we may be overemphasizing a single word of its title. It is perhaps more accurate to say that through the intermediary of time, Proust is in search of an “embodied” imaginary, a space where words, along with their uncon- scious and obscure emergences, knit the unbroken flesh of the world I belong to. That is, I the writer, I the reader, and the living, loving, and dying I. 324 The inherently temporal nature of the fabric of memory provides the space where language weaves the intermingled flesh of world and self. From this per- spective, those who would contrast the duration of inner time-consciousness and the exteriorization of quantitative or measurable time are mistaken. Embodied time is “invariably spatialized.” 325 In this way, by presenting the space of memory as a sort of safety net added to the spectacle of society and its myriad dramas, Proust does more than simply endorse the philosophical tenets of Bergson and Heidegger that seek to capture Being by examining the opacity of Time, for he also verbalizes a sort of sensory time beyond metaphysical categories. In this way, Proust undoes oppositions (idea, duration, and space, on the one hand, and force, perception, emotion, and desire, on the other), and he maps out a psychic and transpsychic universe that is extremely com- plex, a seductive place, a source of communion and sacredness for those who love to read .... At this point, the line of reasoning has been developed enough so that the formula of In Search of Lost Time, the alchemical key to unlock its meaning, may be announced. This “augmented place,” which we feel and which may be inaccessible, but which is constantly promised to us, is presented by the preposition we find in the title of the work, a preposition that indicates continual movement: “ A la recherche ”— we are always in search. In this way, the place remains an open one, and it is not closed off within the revolution of selves — it is “ time embodied. ” 326 Given that embodied time is configured in the space of memory—an insight that Proust connects to the “indissociable symbiosis between the sensible and the sensed” implied in the Christian doctrine of incarnation, the word made flesh 327 — Kristeva contends that Proust does not subscribe to the opposition Bergson sets up between pure subjective duration and an objective time that can be measured in spatio-temporal terms. In Proust’s novel, lost time is immediately “searched for” within a spatial imaginary and within the discontinuity of language, so that spatio-temporal continuity and its fragmentation are not an antithesis to pure time but its servant, the preferred means for attaining time regained. . . .

One’s sense of spatial boundary, laying claim to where one is experientially, is intricately connected to the emplacement of things in memory, the mnemonic attachment to objects held in the folds of memory by having experienced them previously in particular places. We encounter this association in different spheres of human life experi- ence, from subjective psychology on one end of the spectrum to political ide- ology on the other. Without memory, which is inconceivable in the absence of an internal time-consciousness, however this eidetic process is to be explained, we would be spatially disoriented. On the other hand, without the imaginal places enfolded in creases of memory in the brain tissue, future retention and past protention would not be possible in the present. We would do well, there- fore, to move beyond the temporal/spatial split and embrace as phenomeno- logically sound the conjunction time-space articulated by Heidegger. Emplotment in Time of the Other We have seen already that time-space is the ab-ground, the engrounding in the staying-away of the ground, extending forward in holding back. This sense of grounding seems uniquely related to the distinctive human capacity to narrate coherently events that have been experienced episodically. 329 Our sense of time proceeds from this capacity for “emplotment,” 330 in the felicitous idiom of Ricoeur, which he aptly characterized as a “configurating” and “judicative” act that involves “grasping together” 331 divergent events and thematizing them into the unified story of a myth. The fictive recounting of factuality is predicated on a presumed reciprocity between narrativity and temporality, a reciprocity that necessarily implies circularity of reasoning. As Ricoeur succinctly expressed it, “Time becomes human to the extent that it is organized after the manner of a narrative; a narrative, in turn, is meaningful to the extent that it portrays the features of temporal experience.” 332 The narrative structuring of time by the temporal structure of narrative would seem to lead hermeneutically to an inver- sion of the circle, whereby the end is read from the beginning and the begin- ning from the end. Upon closer inspection, however, we observe that recapit- ulation is not dependent on sequential coherence. On the contrary, narrated time, in its cyclicality, revolves about the poles of memory and expectation.

With this discernment we take the turn of Levinas, a turn that, by the author’s own admission, was greatly indebted to Franz Rosenzweig’s “new thinking” (neue denken) . 333 Rosenzweig’s preoccupation with temporality in his literary masterpiece Der Stern der Erlösung (which first appeared in 1921) is apparent in his axiomatic acceptance of the three theolog- ical categories, creation (Schöpfung) , revelation (Offenbarung) , and redemption (Erlösung) . Each of these corresponds to a dimension of time: creation to the ever- renewed past, revelation to the ever-enduring present, redemption to the ever- coming future. For Rosenzweig, the temporal mode has ontological status only by virtue of its theological correlates. His theology, therefore, may be labeled a metaphysics of temporality whereby the traditional distinction between time and eternity is transcended in the eternalization of time through the temporal- ization of eternity: in the fullness of the moment, one encounters the perpetual coming-to-be of what has always been. In a manner similar to Schelling, whose later thought betrays an a‹nity with traditional kabbalah, for Rosenzweig God is the being of eternity, the eternal being, which temporally becomes in the eternality of temporal becoming. 334 In the essay Das neue Denken, published in 1925 with the aim of offering read- ers pointers on how to read Der Stern, Rosenzweig writes that time is “entirely real” for the one who embraces the new thinking (neue denken) , which he also calls speech-thinking (sprachdenken) , in contrast to the philosopher interested in immutable essences who wants “to know nothing of time.” The critical element of speech, therefore, is the verb, which in German is Zeitwort, literally, time- word, the part of language that conveys knowledge of the tenses (Zeiten) of real- ity. 335 Rosenzweig thus expresses the “secret” of the “wisdom of the new phi- losophy” encapsulated in Goethe’s phrase “understanding at the right time” (Verstehen zur rechten Zeit) : 336 understanding always occurs in the present, “time in the most temporal sense” (Zeit im zeitlichsten Sinn) . 337 In another passage in the same essay, Rosenzweig elaborates on the interconnectedness between time (especially in the form of the present) and sprachdenken: Thus the new thinking’s temporality gives rise to its new method.

The method of speech takes the place of the method of thinking, as developed in all earlier philosophies. Thinking is timeless and wants to be timeless. . . . Speech is bound to time, nourished by time, [and] it neither can nor wants to abandon this ground of nourishment; it does not know beforehand what will emerge; it lets itself be given its cues from others; it actually lives by another’s life. . . . To need time means: not to be able to presuppose anything, to have to wait for everything, to be depen- dent on the other for what is ours. All this is entirely unthinkable to the thinking thinker, while it alone suits [entspricht] the speech-thinker. Speech-thinker — for of course the new, speaking-thinking is also thinking, just as the old, the thinking did not come about without inner speaking; the difference between the old and new, logical and grammatical thinking, does not lie in sound and silence, but in the need of an other and, what is the same thing, in the taking of time seriously. 338 Rosenzweig’s insight that taking time seriously entails being in need of the other is elaborated in Levinas, who repeatedly stresses the correlation of the structure of the experience of alterity and temporality, the internal form of sub- jectivity. 339 Awareness of self comes to be through facing the other without oth- ering the face, an exposure to exteriority, an openness to “the deportation or the transcendence beyond any end and any finality: the thinking of the absolute without this absolute being reached as an end, which again would have signi- fied finality and finitude. The idea of the Infinite is a thought released from con- sciousness . . . according to the thought, perhaps the most profoundly consid- ered thought, of the release with regard to being, of dis-inter-est: a relation without a hold on being and without subservience to the conatus essendi, contrary to knowledge and to perception.” 340 The infinite of which Levinas speaks is not the negative abstraction of meontological speculation, the not-being of Neo- platonic metaphysics, but rather an enigma of transcendence, “the proximity of the Other as Other,” the “intervention of a meaning” that “disturbs phenom- ena” 341 as a consequence of one’s ethical relationship to another human being. Such a relationship defies the subject’s attempt to re/present transcendence as a presence, to reduce the other in the identity of the same, an alterity undyingly beyond the clasp of intentionality, as we realize most poignantly in the invari- able (un)eventuality of death. Similarly, apprehension of time issues from con- templating thought-thinking-what-cannot-be-thought, the infinite surplus, incomprehensible and unassimilable, the “ always of noncoincidence, but also the always of the relationship, an aspiration and an awaiting.” 342 For Levinas, the con- junction of time and being implied by the dialogical temporalization of being indicates that at all times “the event of being, the esse, the essence, passes over to what is other than being . . . being’s other, otherwise-than-being” 343 —a subjectivity Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 51 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 51"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"to be conceived not as immanence and essence but as the correlative interplay of the Said and the Saying, which resists ontologization and “overflows the very being it thematizes in stating it to the other.” 344 From this vantage point, the nature of time, by which we calibrate the inessentiality of being, that is, the oth- erwise-than-being displayed in the concealment of being-otherwise, is the enig- matic absolution that betrays the “trace of illeity ” in a present that remains open as “difference” with respect to an “ab-solute past” 345 continuously refigured as the future. 346 The manifestation of being, the appearing, is indeed the primary event, but the very primacy of the primary is in the presence of the present. A past more ancient than any present, a past which was never present and whose other signification remains to be described, signifies over and beyond the manifestation of being, which thus would convey but a moment of this signifying signification. In the diachrony . . . with regard to the progressiveness of manifestation, one can suspect there is the interval that separates the same from the other, an interval that is reflected in manifestation. For manifes- tation, which one might have thought to be by right a fulgurating instant of open- ness and intuition, is discontinuous, and lasts from a question to the response. But this leads us to surprise the Who that is looking, the identical subject, allegedly placed in the openness of Being, as the crux of a diachronic plot (which remains to be determined) between the same and the other. 347 Time is indicative of a narrative telling, a diachronic plot whose synchronic crux is open-ended, yielding a rhetoric of temporality characterized by a con- fluence of repetition and change too complex for simplistic binary opposi- tion, 348 a past determined by a future that anticipates the past as a word spoken in the dialogue between the same and other, the question and response. “The relationship with the other is time: it is an untotalizable diachrony in which one moment pursues another without ever being able to retrieve it, to catch up with it, or coincide with it .... Time means that the other is forever beyond me, irre- ducible to the synchrony of the same. The temporality of the interhuman opens up the meaning of otherness and the otherness of meaning.” 349 The intrinsic linking of alterity and temporality underscores as well the tex- ture of the erotic fabric that envelops time. The fecundity of eros signifies the desire for the other in the mystery of the other’s essential inessentiality. Sig- nificantly, Levinas identifies this transcendence, which cannot be spatial in nature and precludes possession of the other, as the feminine. 350 The pathos of love, however, consists in an insurmountable duality of beings. It is a relationship with what always slips away. The relationship does not ipso facto neutral- Chapter One 52 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 52"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"ize alterity but preserves it. . . . The other as other is not here an object that becomes ours or becomes us; to the contrary, it withdraws into its mystery. Neither does this mystery of the feminine — the feminine: essentially other — refer to any romantic notions of the mysterious, unknown, or misunderstood woman. . . . What matters to me in this notion of the feminine is not merely the unknowable, but a mode of being that consists in slipping away from the light. . . . It is a flight before light. Hiding is the way of existing of the feminine, and this fact of hiding is precisely modesty. 351 Just as the face of the other can be confronted only in its inaccessibility, so the flow of time is renewed in its anarchical, nonoriginal chiasmus, the immemo- rial lapse in the nonsimultaneity of the Said and the Saying 352 — momentarily abiding, abidingly momentary—the supplementing (suppléance) that originates without origin, the creaturality (la créaturalité) that begins without beginning, 353 the meaning that Levinas elicits from the word “anarchy,” literally, without an arché. 354 The nexus of time and the face a‹rmed by Levinas provides the temporal basis for a phenomenology of non-phenomenality, a phenomenology that eschews the metaphysics of presence, a phenomenological canvassing of the unapparent. 355 The implication of this insight is captured poetically by Jean-Luc Marion when he notes that “phenomenologically, time does not pass; if it were passing, it would not leave any trace and thus would destroy nothing.” To cal- culate time, therefore, we must assume that the past is “accumulated in the flesh” of a person, most particularly in the face, which is where the “flesh is most openly visible”; yet the “unique characteristic” of the face is that it is the “sole place where precisely nothing can be seen,” and thus it delineates the “point at which all visible spectacle happens to be impossible, where there is nothing to see, where intuition can give nothing [of the] visible.” 356 The impossibility implied in envisaging the invisible visage provides a template by which we can measure the temporal e›ux as the incessant becoming of what has everlastingly been, steadfast in its transience, transient in its steadfastness. One never sees the same face twice, because time, in being accumulated, deforms it as much as it shapes it. Only time can draw the portrait of a face, since it alone sketches it. Time distinguishes the face, because it marks it — in the taking of flesh, in archive. But there is more: time, as the past accomplished, should never be able to appear if it were limited to passing. Like death, as soon as the moment has come, time is no longer it for me. . . . Completed time manifests itself in what it removes, destroys, and undoes — the phenomenality of ruins of stone, but especially of ruins of flesh. 357 Thinking Time / Hermeneutic Suppositions 53 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 53"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The inherent link between time as that which abides in passing and the face as that which forever eludes the gaze of the other underscores death as an essen- tial aspect in understanding the texture and tonality of temporality. “To envis- age a face,” writes Marion, “requires less to see it than to wait for it, to wait for its accomplishment, the terminal act, the passage to effectivity. That is why the truth of a life is only unveiled at its last instant .... And to see the other finally, in truth, would mean, in the end, closing his or her eyes.” 358 A profound par- adox is here recovered: the face can be seen only at death, in the closing of the eyes, the instruments of perceptual vision. In the course of life, the face beholds and is not beheld; at death it can no longer behold and is thus beheld. My reflections on time, truth, and death elicited from and a‹xed within the kabbalistic orientation, as constructed from representative texts, begin from this hermeneutical standpoint: the temporality of time imparts the meaning of oth- erness as the otherness of meaning encoded in the secret of the other, the mys- tery that constitutes the alterity engendered as feminine, the visibly invisible rendered invisibly visible from within the site of hiding, a blindness — bestowed on the modest—that visualizes time in its genealogical heterogene- ity. 359 Nicolas Abraham expresses the matter in terms of the category of the “transphenomenal,” which he considers the “special dimension” that “defines the field of psychoanalysis.” “Time,” he writes, “is understood in its internal genesis; it is someone’s time, of course, but it can only be perceived by some- one else.” 360 In contemplating the texture of time that may be mined from the works of kabbalistic theosophy, we may read backward from the psychological to the ontological—a turnaround justified by the fact that the onto-theological standpoint of traditional kabbalah (to borrow Heidegger’s locution) precludes the possibility of these two being severed, since the soul not only participates ontically in the substance of God’s being but is the mirror through which the invisible is seen as the true appearance of apparent truth. The discernment at the psychical level that time is always the measure of the inscrutability of the other leads to the realization of time as the mystery of the transcendent other becom- ing other in relation to itself, the externalization of inner time occasioned by the internalization of exterior space. 361 Chapter One 54 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 54"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"LINEAR CIRCULARITY/(A)TEMPORAL POETICS Nature revolves but never advances, Eternal — that a circle, this a line. Edward Young Encircled Line: A Mythologic of Hebraic Time Time, like other facets of phenomenal experience, has played a critical role in the history of world religions. 1 In Judaism specifically, numerous opinions, spanning many centuries, geographical localities, intellectual influences, and lit- erary genres, have been expressed about time. Accordingly, I make no attempt here to provide a comprehensive overview of the understanding of time in the variegated history of Judaism. 2 I do take the liberty, however, of making two observations, the generality of which will foster rather than eschew specific his- torical analyses. First, it is not viable to depict temporality in opposition to or separate from spatiality in Judaism, let alone to privilege the former as the gen- uine mark of Hebrew spirituality. 3 Practitioners of Judaism in its disparate spatio-temporal instantiations—beginning in the ancient Near Eastern milieu within which the oldest parts of the scriptural legacy began to take shape and continuing through the richly diverse second-temple period to the age of for- mative rabbinic Judaism and beyond through the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and modernity to the present—have cultivated concepts of sacred space and sacred time simultaneously. Indeed, while it is possible to distinguish spatial and tem- poral coordinates notionally, in lived experience they intersect and converge: time can only be delineated in relation to place and place only in relation to time. The sixteenth-century homilist and exegete Judah Loew ben Bezalel of Prague, deferentially referred to by the acronym Maharal, had this confluence in 2 55 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 55"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"mind when he noted that “time and place are one matter [ ha-zeman we-ha-maqom inyan e h ad] as is known to those who understand.” 4 The specific context of Maharal’s comment is a discussion on the nature of the revelation of Torah at Sinai in the third month after the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. In Maharal’s view, neither the spatial nor the temporal coordinates of the experi- ence were accidental or arbitrary; on the contrary, the transcendental nature of the truth disclosed necessitated the place and time of the event, that is to say, both when and where the epiphany occurred approximated as much as possi- ble the metaphysical constitution of what was divulged in the physical world. I return subsequently to this theme in the thought of Judah Loew, with spe- cial focus on the dimension of time; noteworthy for the moment is his insis- tence on the inseparability of space and time. This insight cuts a path that can lead to the depths of the religious sensibility that has informed Jewish piety through the generations, an insight enhanced by the philological oddity that the word olam can denote both the spatial measure of the “world” and the tempo- ral magnitude of “eternity.” The convergence of space and time that ensues from this dual connotation is further enhanced by the rabbinic etymology that playfully relates the word olam to the root alam, “to conceal” or “to hide.” 5 The mystery of being is disclosed by the juxtaposition of space and time that char- acterizes our experience of the phenomenal world. 6 As philosopher and sinol- ogist François Jullien succinctly put it in a more contemporary vernacular, “ Le temps et l’espace ne sont pas dissociables l’un de l’autre: aux portions du temps répondent des parties de l’espace, leurs emblèmes sont communs, chaque période est solidaire d’un climat, chaque orient lié à une saison. ” 7 Particularly in the arena of ritualized behavior, one discerns the concomitant spatialization of time and temporalization of space. 8 Rather than sharply bifurcating the terms paired in the compound “time-space,” it is more useful to note their convergence with/in varied socio-cultural constellations. Second, from the perspective of Judaism as a religious phenomenon, the assumed mutual exclusivity of time configured as linear and as circular—the arrow and the cycle—a crucial dichotomy that has shaped conceptions of tem- porality in Western thought, is in fact false; the two cannot so easily be sepa- rated. 9 There has been a tendency—based, in the words of Jonathan Z. Smith, on a “groundless distinction” 10 — to correlate linear time with the historical and cyclical time with the mythical, and likewise to correlate the former with ancient Israel and Judaism and the latter with either Near Eastern or Hellenistic models of religious philosophy. 11 But underlying the biblical and rabbinic con- ceptions of time is a convergence of history and myth that endows ritual per- formance with historical meaning and historical facticity with ritual transcen- dence. 12 Recurrent patterns transpire within the narrative framework of linear succession—the timelessness of lived time extending in an attenuated circle of Chapter Two 56 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 56"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"return 13 — yielding a temporality where the interminably ephemeral is ephemerally interminable. 14 As the philosopher Eric Voegelin observed in his reflections on the historical evolution of ancient Israelite cosmology and escha- tology, “When the revelation of the transcendent God has become the experi- ential center of order and symbolization, the transcendental implications of the compact symbols are set free; and correspondingly the volume of meaning in the symbols shrinks until the ritual renewal of order in time becomes a prefiguration of its ultimate restoration in eternity.” 15 The entelechy of mes- sianic teleology revolves around hope in the future and faith in the past, but the hub, as it were, that makes possible the spinning of the rim, is belief in an eter- nal present—the moment always a semblance of the moment it will never have been — in which the divine-human drama is continuously and divergently enacted through Israel’s ceremonial practices and obedience to the covenantal law. 16 Interestingly, the ideal set forth by Voegelin corresponds to what he else- where depicts in terms of Plato’s idea of metaxy, the “in-between,” which is nei- ther time nor eternity but the erotic tension of lingering betwixt the poles of temporal becoming and eternal being. 17 In this state, which Voegelin identifies as the “philosophical experience,” the two poles endure in their autonomy: “Neither does eternal being become an object in time, nor is temporal being transposed into eternity. We remain in the ‘in-between,’ in a temporal flow of experience in which eternity is nevertheless present. The flow cannot be dis- sected into a past, a present, and a future of world-time, for at every point of the flow there persists the tension toward eternal being transcending time. The concept most suitable to express the presence of eternal being in the temporal flow is flowing presence. ” 18 It is surely wise to mark out carefully the multiple conceptions of time attested in biblical, post-biblical, formative and medieval rabbinic texts. Still, a broad view can be legitimately posited if the taxonomic classifications are exam- ined retrospectively from a redactional standpoint, which must take into account the pluriformity and ongoing evolution of texts that eventually become fixed, albeit relatively so, as an identifiable canon that informs the beliefs and actions of lived liturgical communities. Thus there is cogency in thinking of biblical time in terms of a providential sense of history, moving from creation to revelation. But it is not valid to identify this simply and unqualifiedly as lin- ear time, 19 which is supposedly transformed by the rabbis into what Levi- Strauss calls the “totemic” view of time, that is, the causal explanation of events in terms of a mythological past and eschatological future. 20 As we may elicit from dicta preserved in various literary sources, the rabbis did not uphold a hard-and-fast distinction between past, present, and future; the present has no reality except as an interlude between an idealized past and Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 57 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 57"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"a utopian future, when the matter is considered vertically, or between this world and the world to come, when it is considered horizontally. 21 Moreover, the rabbinic conception of time as it pertains to ritualistic matters is not, strictly speaking, a matter of chronometrically measuring the threefold duration of physical events; rather, it is very much a consequence of the intentionality ex- pressed by the agent in relation to these events, an idea typified, for instance, in the ruling that one may add to sacred time by consecrating the profane (mosifin me- h ol al qodesh) , the justification for the custom of commencing the observance of Sabbath or a holiday prior to sunset, or the custom (transmitted in the name of R. Ishmael) of inaugurating the fast of Yom Kippur toward the end of the ninth day of Tishrei. 22 This principle is concretized in the maxim kol maqom she- yesh bo shevut mosifin me- h ol al qodesh, “In every place that there is [a matter of ] rest, one can add to the sacred from the profane.” 23 Noteworthy is the application of this principle in a tradition attributed to R. Yudan that the time “in which the creation of the world [mele’khet ha-olam] was completed” is the “extra hour wherein the sacred is added onto the profane [zo sha‘ah yeterah she-mosifin me- h ol al qodesh] .” According to this statement, creation was completed in the luminous shadow of twilight, the borderline moment between the mundane and holy, and hence it is designated as the hour wherein the sacred can be added to the profane. In one midrashic context, the dictum of R. Yudan is linked exegetically to the verse “Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God” (Exod 20:9). 24 The philosophical understanding that associates the conclusion of the creation with the inception of Sabbath is tied thematically to the halakhic man- date to initiate the observance of Sabbath on Friday before the o‹cial start of the seventh day at sunset. Although other talmudic passages can also be cited to sub- stantiate the point, the one I have mentioned is su‹cient to assert that from both halakhic and aggadic perspectives the rabbis did not proffer a rigorous conception of an autonomous “objective” time—and this in spite of the metic- ulous concern they demonstrated with respect to establishing the proper tem- poral frame to determine the Jewish calendar based on the sanctification of the new moon (qiddush ha- h odesh) , a ritual obligation often presented in rabbinic lit- erature as an act that distinguishes the Jews from all other nations, who deter- mine their calendar on a solar basis. 25 It is reasonable to conjecture, moreover, that the roots for the rabbinic fusion of historical and mythical layers of meaning lie in the view of time operative in the ritual conception of covenantal history proffered in the priestly and deuteronomistic codes embedded in the scriptural canon. If we are to speak of a linear conception of history in biblical sources, as many scholars have insisted, we cannot sever it from an equally present cyclical pattern that is related to the Chapter Two 58 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 58"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"narrative reinscription of the past in sacred text and commemorative ritual anchored to the rhythms of nature. I see no reason to speak of a “change in the treatment of time from the view of the biblical literature to that of the rabbinic literature” as a “transition from a collective historical memory to a collective ahistorical memory.” 26 Historical and ahistorical are not to be polarized respec- tively as dynamic-optimistic and static-pessimistic models of time. 27 To grasp the concept of time that has informed Jewish religiosity, it is better to speak of linear circularity, or circular linearity, 28 a mythopoeic conception that prevails in the scriptural texts produced by priests and scribes as well as in the perico- pae of the rabbis that over time inspired the minds and hearts of Jewish poets, philosophers, exegetes, and mystical visionaries. The widely proclaimed epistemological insight that human thinking is circu- lar is perceived as a weakness by those who conceive the path of thinking as a journey commencing at a point of departure and terminating at a point of arrival. 29 Yet, the yearning to get somewhere notwithstanding, the human mind, it seems, moves in a manner more like a spiral, winding this way and that way, a kind of circularity that resonates with the envisioning of reading as a mutual round dance, the reader encircling the time of the text encircling the time of the reader. In this twofold encircling is the reversibility of the interpre- tative timeline, the redoubled reflexivity that provides the epistemic basis for any historical sketch, interpreting the past from the standpoint of the present, which is, in turn, informed by the very past one seeks to interpret. To decode the meaning of a text, one must be able to read from beginning to end and from end to beginning, a hermeneutical axiom articulated by Rosenzweig in the bril- liance of Der Stern der Erlösung. 30 The possibility of reading in inverse trajectories does not imply a closed circle, as implied in the ancient Greek belief in the cycli- cality of time, epitomized in the statement attributed by Aristotle 31 to Alcmaeon of Croton: “Men perish because they cannot join the beginning to the end.” 32 On the contrary, the ability to read bidirectionally presumes an open circle, which necessitates the impossibility of determining the end from the beginning or the beginning from the end; the reversibility of the timeline implies not clo- sure at either terminus but rather an ever-changing flux, which destabilizes the model of an irreversible succession proceeding unilaterally from start to finish. This idea is encapsulated pithily in the statement ein muqdam u-me’u h ar ba-torah, “there is no before or after in Scripture.” 33 The conventional, perhaps even commonsensical, conception of linear time, a succession of moments lurching forward like a stream rushing over intractable rocks of historical facticity, breaks under the weight of this supposition: when we reach the end of the line, we realize the circularity of the path, a return to the beginning that beckons an extending forward of a new progression. In Foucault’s pointed but liberal for- Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 59 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 59"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"mulation: “The most direct line is also the most perfect circle, which, in com- ing to a close, suddenly becomes straight, linear, and as economical as light.” 34 To say “there is no before or after” does not proffer a static conception of the eternality of Torah set in opposition to time and therefore resistant to the fluctu- ation of historical contingency—a binary considered “traditional” in Western thought 35 — but rather a conception of temporality that calls into question the linear model of aligning events chronoscopically in a sequence stretched invari- ably between before and after. The hermeneutical principle of the rabbis embraces a notion of time that is circular in its linearity and linear in its circu- larity. When the scriptural narrative is viewed within this framework, after is before precisely because before is after, but before cannot be after unless after is before. Underlying the dictum, moreover, is a belief in revelation as the textualiza- tion of sacred language—the materialization of text in both graphic and phonic dimensions, to be grasped concurrently and not sequentially — linked to a moment that has no history, the interval of time that intrudes instantaneously and thereby cuts the timeline from any past or future, the fullness of the moment that is both continuous and unique, the perpetual creation of what has eternally been. 36 To be the moment, the moment, at all moments, must pass as the moment on the way to becoming the moment it is to be, but in passing to become the moment it is to be, the moment ceases to be the moment on the way to becoming the moment it is to be. In the Hebraic/Hellenic wisdom of the author of Ecclesiastes, mah she-hayah kevar niqra shemo, “that which has been is named already” (6:1)—what has come to pass has by now received its name, and hence cannot, even momentarily, be of the moment when that which is is what will come to be. A similar conception of a timeless time emerges in a different terminological register from a fragment of Parmenides preserved by Simplicius in his com- mentary on Aristotle’s Physics. According to the wisdom imparted to and by Parmenides, time is not a flux of becoming with past or future but rather the saturation of being characteristic of that which is, the eternity of the nunc stans: “It was not in the past, nor shall it be, since it is now, all at once, one, contin- uous.” 37 Congruently, Plato depicted the instant as the point of transition between motion and rest, the point through and in which what is at rest comes to motion and what is in motion comes to rest. “When, being in motion, it comes to rest and when, being at rest, it changes to being in motion, it must itself not be in one time. It is simply not possible for it to admit being earlier at rest and later in motion and later at rest without undergoing change.” 38 Caught between coming and going, the moment can have no past or future, and con- sequently no present; strictly speaking, there is no moment in time but only Chapter Two 60 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 60"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"time in the moment. What makes the triadic constellation of time possible is the positing of a momentary union that resists temporal computation. The reversible reversibility of the time flow I am describing is evident in the event of reading when viewed as repeatedly hearing anew the text yet-to-be- inscripted, a supposition that rests on the assumption that text and reader evolve correlatively in the unfolding of time through patterns discerned from the inter- pretative gesture of repeatedly rendering the old as the new initiating the new as the old. The intersection of hermeneutics and temporality may be thought from the expectation of novel life germinating in the ground of genuine repe- tition. 39 Heidegger raised this very point when he noted that the “first princi- ple of hermeneutics” is to discern that historical thinking is anchored in the pos- sibility of returning to the past as future; indeed, the past is authentic only to the extent that it is futurally present—present in the future as the future of the pres- ent. 40 At this crisscross we can discern the momentous circle in which we are chronically ensconced: the thinking of time must be pondered from the time of thinking, but the time of thinking can be reckoned only from the thinking of time. 41 To heed these words is to take to heart the interface of time, truth, and interpretation, an interface effaced in the moment displayed by the ecstatic and horizontal aspects of temporal threefoldness, arising from and giving birth to the primordial unity of past, present, and future. 42 In his reflections on Proust’s A la recherche du temps perdu, Deleuze thus expressed the inherent correlation of time and hermeneutics: “To seek the truth is to interpret, decipher, explicate. But this ‘explication’ is identified with the development of the sign in itself. This is why the Search is always temporal, and the truth always a truth of time.” 43 The search for truth, the quest to establish meaning, invariably is temporal. Timely truth, at all times, is the gift sent and received as the truth of and in time. Timeless Time and the Rotation of the Sefirot The task of this book is to elucidate hermeneutically the correlation of time, truth, and death as may be educed from works of kabbalistic theosophy. The path upon which I shall embark to cogitate about this matter is to reflect on each of the letters in the Hebrew word for “truth,” emet. From late antiquity a tradi- tion has been transmitted in the name of Simeon ben Laqish pointing out that this word is composed of the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alpha- bet (alef, mem, and tau) , signifying thereby that truth is comprehensive of all the semiotic ciphers that weave the fabric of the holy language. In chapter 5, I ana- lyze the rabbinic text in which this idea is preserved. 44 Needless to say, listen- ing to the literary context in which the dictum appears is crucial in determin- ing its precise meaning.

The cosmic judge is upheld as the model of behavior for human judges and thus a discussion about the latter will of necessity lead to the former. In the context of these pronouncements, we learn of the “seal” ( h otam) of God, a seal that seals the judgment, the stamp of truth that makes the edict stand. Hence, the adage that the signet of God is truth from which springs the observation that emet is composed of the first, middle, and last letters of the alphabet. To think the essence of this matter, to submit to the call of what must be thought, 45 is to discern the correlation of truth and lan- guage, or, more precisely, Hebrew, which is depicted in rabbinic lore (and all the more so in the esoteric accretions to the tradition) as the cosmic language, a “pure” or “originary” speech, the proto/verb inscripted as spoken, spoken as inscripted. 46 At this juncture, we do not yet know what this correlation is sup- posed to communicate, but in time the matter will be unraveled. What can be posited here is that medieval kabbalists introduced (or, at least, made explicit) the link between the consonants of emet and the three points that dominate the caricature of time in human consciousness. 47 Alef induces us to consider the past, mem the present, and tau the future. Prior to delving into the letters and their corresponding temporal modalities, some preliminary remarks are needed on the place of time in the metaphysical ruminations of kabbalists from the Middle Ages to the early modern period. 48 We commence with a negative assertion: From the kabbalists’ vantage point, time is not dependent on the motion of bodies in space (the Aristotelian definition) nor is it the eternal forms’ fleeting shadow in the world of matter (the Platonic model). Time, in its primordiality (which is to be understood ontologically and not chronologically) is linked to the ebb and flow of divine energy, the vital force that generates the polarities of motion and rest, light and dark, life and death. 49 Moses Cordovero, a sixteenth-century kabbalist from Safed, expressed the matter epigrammatically: when he wrote that “Time is the secret of the rotation of the emanations [sod gilggul ha-sefirot] , during the day this particular emanation, during the night this particular emanation, and on Sabbath this particular emanation. The time that was from the day that the world was created, and the emanations rotated, is not the time that evolves from now and forward, but rather there are new aspects, for the order of time [seder zemannim] that is before him has no boundary and no end.” 50 The ephemerality of time as the constancy of what passes away is associated in the continuation of the above passage with the phenomenon of innovative interpretations of Torah: there are always new meanings to be elicited from the Chapter Two 62 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 62"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"text of Torah, since, in its mystical valence, Torah is the incarnate form of Ein Sof, the delimitation of the limitless that is manifest in potentially infinite con- cealments, the ineffable name gesticulated in potentially endless circumlocu- tions. Like other sixteenth-century kabbalists, Cordovero explicitly a‹rms the paradox that the hiding of the divine light facilitates its disclosure, and hence the emanation of the sefirot is concomitantly their veiling, much as a garment con- ceals what it reveals by revealing what it conceals. As he says in Pardes Rimmonim: “The cause of disclosure is the cause of concealment and the cause of conceal- ment the cause of disclosure [sibbat ha-hitggallut hu sibbat ha-he‘elem we-sibbat ha-he‘elem hu sibbat ha-hitggallut] , that is, through the concealment of the great light and its being clothed in a garment it is revealed. Thus the light is concealed, and, in truth, it is revealed, for if it were not concealed, it would not be revealed.” 51 In the section on the term levushin, “garments,” in his Shi‘ur Qomah, Cordovero reiterates the point: “Now in this manner is also the issue of the garments [malbushim] in the sefirot, for he placed a barrier between himself and the lower existents, and he hid the force of his governance through them. . . . And this matter is addressed in their saying that disclosure is the cause of concealment [ ha-hitggallut sibbat ha-he‘elem] , for what he reveals through the intermediary of these sefirot is the cause of the concealment of his existence and governance that cannot be comprehended at all by the lower beings.” 52 Insofar as God and Torah are identical, an axiomatic truth of kabbalah from its inception, it follows that Torah in its textual embodiment—the theosophic principle that undergirds the anthropological ideal of corporeality as embodied textuality 53 –is the veil that reveals the infinite by concealing the light it reveals, the voice that declaims the ineffable by muting the name it declaims. It is precisely from the juxtaposi- tion of disclosure and concealment, expanding and withholding, that the tex- ture of time in its ontological comportment can be discerned. 54 Cordovero’s linkage of innovative explications of Torah and the evolving nature of time underscores the intricate connection in kabbalistic lore between phenomenological hermeneutics and the ontology of time. 55 Paradoxically, the idea of an infinite Torah entails that the text is inherently timeless, for that which is infinite cannot be contained in any temporal frame, which is by neces- sity finite, yet the meaning of a text that is inherently timeless is manifest only in and through an endless chain of interpretation that unfolds persistently in time; indeed, in its most basic hermeneutical sense, time is the unremitting recitation of the timeless text. In this matter, as with so many of the themes that shaped the worldview of traditional kabbalists, the mystical sensibility is a deepening of an approach found in older rabbinic sources. While one must be on guard about making general claims with respect to the rabbinic sages, I feel confident that it is con- Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 63 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 63"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"ceptually sound, and even methodologically valid, to speak of a rabbinic notion of time that is intimately connected to understanding the revelation of Torah as a recurring phenomenon. By way of illustration, consider the following decla- ration preserved in the Babylonian Talmud: R. Judah began [to expound] the honor of Torah, and he explicated the verse “[Moses and the levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying:] Silence! Hear O Israel! Today you have become the people [of the Lord, your God]” (Deut 27:9). Was the Torah given to Israel on that very day? Was that day not at the end of the forty years? Rather this is to teach you that the Torah is cherished by those who study it each day as the day it was given from Mount Sinai. 56 Leaving aside the redactional issues and the reasonable demand on the part of historically minded text scholars to locate this dictum diachronically on some chronological grid, it is not unwarranted to say that this statement gives voice to a religious belief (for lack of a better term) foundational to the reconstruc- tion of Judaism promoted and sanctioned by the Palestinian and Babylonian sages: study of Torah demands that one be able to imagine each day as a recur- rence of the Sinaitic theophany, a reiteration of the past that induces the novelty of the present. The conception of time as the moment of unique repetition is elucidated fur- ther in the theme of reliving the experience of Sinai as it appears in textual aggregates presumed to be earlier than the aforecited talmudic passage. Two notable examples are su‹cient here, though one can find the same approach to time in rabbinic literature in relation to other scriptural subjects. 57 The first example centers on the interpretation of the conclusion of the verse “Take to heart these instructions with which I charge you this day” (Deut 6:6): “ ‘With which I charge you this day.’ So that they will not be in your eyes like an obso- lete ordinance [ke-diyo t agma yeshenah] that a person does not heed, but rather like a new ordinance [ke-diyo t agma h adashah] that all run to read.” 58 The second illus- tration is an anonymous exegesis on the words “on this very day, they entered the wilderness of Sinai” (Exod 19:1): “Did they arrive ‘on this very day’ [ ba-yom ha-zeh] ? Rather when you study my words, they should not be old [ yeshenim] in your eyes but it should be as if Torah were given on that very day [ke-illu ha-yom nittenah torah] .” 59 Whatever alternative conceptions of time one may elicit from rabbinic liter- ature, and surely there are others, the one under consideration has special significance insofar as it exposes a deep-seated nexus in the rabbinic imaginary between time and text, revelation and interpretation, poetic envisioning and hermeneutic explication: each interpretative gesture is a reenactment of the rev- Chapter Two 64 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 64"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"elatory experience, albeit from its unique vantage point, each moment a novel replication of the past. Repetition and novelty, accordingly, are not antinomi- cal; what recurs is precisely what has been that which will recur as what has never been. Paraphrasing the second midrashic gloss cited above, Solomon ben Isaac, the eleventh-century talmudic and biblical exegete better known by the acronym Rashi, wrote on the words ba-yom ha-zeh, “on this very day”: “Words of Torah should be new [ h adashim] for you as if they were given this day.” 60 This medieval commentator adds nothing substantial of his own, but by newly reiterating the rabbinic dictum more or less verbatim, he elucidates fur- ther the original intent; indeed one might say Rashi demonstrates that the rab- bis’ principle with respect to the Written Torah can be applied to their own dicta assembled in the Oral Torah: for one who studies either the Written or the Oral Torah, the text must be as new as the Torah was on the day it was revealed to the Israelites who stood at the foot of Mount Sinai. The source that likely influenced Rashi’s formulation makes this point exactly: Ben Zoma said: Why is it written “In the third month [after the Israelites had gone forth from the land of Egypt, on this day they entered the wilderness of Sinai]” (Exod 19:1) “On that day” [ ba-yom ha-hu] is not written here [but rather ] “on this day” [ ba-yom ha-zeh] , as if [ke-illu] on this day they came from the wilderness of Sinai. Every day that you are occupied with Torah, you should say, “It is as if we received it from Sinai on this day” [ke-illu ba-yom ha-zeh qibbalttiha mi-sinai] , and it says, “This day [ ha-yom ha-zeh] the Lord your God commands you to observe” (Deut 26:16). 61 The claim made with respect to Torah study represents a more generic under- standing of ritual time proffered by the rabbis, a notion of temporality that con- nects past and present by imaginally enfolding one in the other rather than by connecting them with a line. The past can be experienced as present because the present can be experienced as past, but the present can be experienced as past only because the past can be experienced as present. With respect to this point, consider Maharal’s explication of Rashi’s construal (based on a midrashic prece- dent) 62 of the words “and has given it to you” (Exod 13:11) as “it should be in your eyes as if [ke-illu] it were given to you on this day”: And similarly the Torah is beyond time in accord with the gradation of the Torah [we-khen ha-torah hi al ha-zeman le-madregat ha-torah] , for time depends on the sun and the movement of the sphere [ki ha-zeman hu toleh ba-shemesh bi-tenu‘at ha-galggal] , and the Torah is above [the sun] .... And with respect to all matters that are beyond time the matter of time is indifferent [we-khol ha-devarim asher hem al ha-zeman kol inyan ha-zeman shaweh] , and nothing is in time except for time [we-eino bi-zeman zulat zeman] .

However, with respect to the few divine matters [devarim elohiyyim] it is thus said, with respect to the gradation that is above time and that is independent of it, it is spoken of in this way. 65 It lies beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss comprehensively the view of time promulgated in Maharal’s voluminous corpus, which may be described as a massive exposé of the spiritual depths of rabbinic aggadah and a defense of the wisdom of the ancient sages against contemporary critiques like that in Azariah de Rossi’s Me’or Einayim. 66 Stylistically, these compositions are marked by copious repetition and reformulation, and hence it would be impossible in this setting to do justice to his religious philosophy. The passage I have cited, how- ever, can serve to illumine the position of the rabbis as preserved in Rashi’s words. According to Maharal, the underlying assumption of the rabbinic dicta regarding the need to experience the reenactment of the Sinaitic epiphany when one studies Torah is that the latter is of an eternal nature impervious to the fluctuations and contingencies of time. He occasionally casts the matter in terms of the contrast between mi s wah, which is “in the body” and thus “temporal” (li- zeman) , and Torah, which is “not physical” and thus “eternally redemptive” (ma s elet le‘olam) , that is, it draws one out from the snare of nature and leads one to the final felicity, the life of the world-to-come. Following older philosophic and kabbalistic texts, Maharal depicts this ultimate condition both as the con- junction of the human and divine intellects, the absorption of the particular in the universal, 67 and as the restoration of the sundry discriminate entities in the material world to the immaterial essence of nondifferentiated unity to the point that there no longer is any discernible separation between the spiritual and physical, God and the cosmos. 68 As he puts it in one of his many treatises, “The Torah is rational [sikhlit] , and everything that is rational does not fall under time. 69 Therefore they say that Torah protects forever, as it is appropriate for the thing that is not temporal and does not change, but the commandment [mi s wah] protects temporarily for it comes to be by the bodily gesture [ma‘aseh ha-guf] ... and the body is dependent on and belongs to time.” 70 Maharal variously describes Torah as the “absolute intellect” (ha - sekhel ha-gamur) , 71 the “supernal intellect” (ha-sekhel ha-elyon) , or the “divine intellect” (ha-sekhel ha-elohi) 72 that comprises the “rational order” (seder sikhli) or “intelligible order” (seder ha- muskkal) 73 by means of which the world was created, and thus it belongs to the “intelligible matters [ ha-inyanim ha-sikhliyyim] whose actions are not in time since Chapter Two 66 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 66"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"they do not fall under time and they do not act by means of the movement from which there is time, and according to the gradation of their importance they act without time . . . the act of God, blessed be he, is completely without time.” 74 Prima facie, the position Maharal articulates seems to be at odds with what is implied in the rabbinic dicta and reiterated in Rashi’s paraphrase. However, if one examines the works of Maharal more assiduously, a case can be made that his view, though largely garbed in medieval philosophical language, is a rea‹rmation of the stance proffered by the rabbis of old: the portrayal of Torah as intellect beyond time serves as the ideational basis for the belief that revela- tion of what is received and reception of what is revealed are ongoing; one can, indeed must, reexperience the Sinaitic theophany continuously, for in every moment both text and interpreter are fashioned anew precisely because they were conceived long ago. 75 Judah Loew’s periodic statements that Torah does not fall under time signify not that the law is atemporal but rather that it embodies the measure of time that transcends the threefold division into past, present, and future; in the moment of revelation, what was and what will be are compresent in what is always never the same. From the rabbinic notion of mattan torah or qabbalat torah, expressions that convey respectively the double ges- ture of the gift of revelation, giving and receiving, we comprehend the property of time that is independent of body and consequently independent of space, a time that can be attributed without contradiction to incorporeal beings. 76 Support for this interpretation may be elicited from the following remark of Maharal: “Just as there are actual days for physical human beings, so there is a time that is not actually time [kakh yesh zeman we-eino zeman mammash] , and it applies to entities that are not corporeal [devarim biltti gashmiyyim] .” 77 A time that is not actually time, zeman we-eino zeman mammash — what kind of time is that? We learn more of this time that is not really time from a second passage that is especially significant, since the topic is the revelation of Torah, the pristine form of intel- lect beyond temporal demarcation, in historical time: With regard to the body that falls under time, it is appropriate to say “For every time” [la-kol zeman] (Eccles 3:1), but [in the case of ] the thing that is exclusively intellect [sekhel] , as the revelation of Torah [qabbalat torah] , which is not a corporeal entity [davar gufani] , it does not fall under time. Concerning this it is said “a moment for every desire” [et le-khol hefe s ] (ibid.), for the present [attah] that conjoins the past and future is not time [zeman] . That is to say, the matter that is intelligible [muskkal] does not fall under time; it comes to pass in the present [na‘aseh be-attah] . 78 In the above citation, Maharal distinguishes between zeman, the mode of tem- porality that applies to corporeal beings subject to generation and corruption, Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 67 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 67"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Chapter Two 68 and et, the mode of temporality that may be attributed to intelligible beings not subject to generation and corruption. The latter is described more specifically as the present (attah) that unites past (avar) and future (attid) . The time in which the Torah is given, the time of revelation, reveals something axiomatic about the revelation of time: in the time of the moment, which is experienced at all times as the moment of time, the present, attah, is the middle or third term that dialec- tically bridges past and future. Here we discern a structure that Maharal applies to various speculative schema in his philosophical presentation of Jewish piety. 79 We find it again in the following passage, which concerns the inner significance of the fact that the Sinaitic theophany took place in the third month after the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt (Exod 19:1): Since the Torah does not fall under time and its category, as every rational matter [davar sikhli] is not under the category of time, it was not appropriate for it to be given except in the third month, for as we already know every [aspect of ] time is divided into past and future, and the present [attah] is the third that mediates between them and that fastens time together, for by means of it the past and future time are conjoined. . . . The term et is suitable for the rational matter since it does not fall at all under time [ ha-zeman] ... . Hence, the present [attah] unites the time [of the past and future] for the end of the past and the beginning of the future is the present, as is known to those who know [and comprehend] the matter [and the content of the substance] of time. The present, therefore, is the third that joins together the time that is divided into two parts, past and future, but it is not essen- tially time [zeman ba-e s em] . Thus the third month alone was selected for the giving of Torah, as it is written “a moment for every desire” (Eccles 3:1), for the moment [et] is the intermediary and the third that is in between the two boundaries of time. 80 Now we can attempt an explanation of Maharal’s paradoxical expression “time that is not actually time,” which he ascribes to Torah and other incorpo- real entities: the time that is not actually time is the time (et) of the present (attah) that links past and future and thereby provides cohesiveness and coherence to the narrative of history by supplying a beginning, middle, and end, which cor- respond theologically to creation, revelation, and redemption—a narratologi- cal conception of history that distinguishes the Jewish people from other nations whose time is bound to the sun or the rotation of the sphere 81 in an eternal cycle of return that has no beginning or end and, consequently, no pos- sibility for authentic novelty or creativity in the middle. 82 The esoteric significance of the scriptural account that links the epiphany at Sinai to the third month is to underscore that the temporal modality appropriate to Torah, which Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 68"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics as intellect does not fall under the category of time, is the “singular present wherein there is no division of time at all” (he-attah ha-meyu h ad she-ein bah h illuq zeman kelal) . 83 The timelessness of the moment accounts for its singularity and volatility, the instant marked, as in the Sabbath at the end of creation, by the reception of form [qabbalat ha- s urah] , which is being without movement [ hawayah beli tenu‘ah] ... a spontaneous being in which there is no being [ hawayah pit‘omit we-ein ba-zeh hawayah] , for every being is in time. . . . for the reception of form is the completion of being [ hashlamat ha-hawayah] ... and this matter is not called “work” [mela’khah] , for there is no work here that has movement; on the contrary, this mat- ter is the acquisition of completion and rest [qinyan ha-shelemut u-menu h ah] ... for the reception of form is on the Sabbath . . . and, consequently, the reception of form has no need for a temporal reality [ hawayah zemanit] , and this is not called “work,” for work involves movement, and movement is related to the body, but the com- pletion of the world in its totality . . . is not in time at all [eino bi-zeman kelal] . 84 The spontaneity of revelation is manifest as well in the sabbatical rest that seals the act of creation, and in the salvific repose of messianic redemption. In this model of time, what is new cannot be surgically severed (either in ex- perience or in theory) from what is old. One of the better known rabbinic for- mulations of this belief is the aphorism transmitted in the name of R. Joshua ben Levi that the Written Torah (miqra) and all the parts of the Oral Torah (mishnah, talmud, tosefet, haggadah) , and “even what an exceptional student [talmid watiq] will say in the future,” were “all spoken to Moses at Sinai, as it says, ‘Look, this one is new!’ (Eccles 1:10), but his friend responds to him, ‘it occurred long ago’ (ibid.)” 85 The excitement that something genuinely novel is uttered, contained in the enthusiastic explosion, “Look, this one is new!” (re’eh zeh h adash hu) is immediately countered with the sobering “it occurred long ago” (kevar hayah le‘olamim) . Using the distinction made by Maharal, we can say that from the per- spective of zeman, the conventional linear idea of time, the two statements are contradictory, for what occurred long ago cannot be new nor can what is new have occurred long ago; however, from the perspective of et, the timeless time of the eternally recurring present (attah) , the statements are not contradictory at all, as only that which occurred long ago can be new and only that which is new could have occurred long ago. That which transpires in the moment— na‘aseh be- attah — does not fall under the category of time, for, as noted above, the triadic division of time is no longer operative when past is experienced as future that is present, present as past that is future, and future as present that is past. Like the wisdom that Nietzsche’s imaginary prophet Zarathustra imparted to the 69 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 69"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"dwarf in the section entitled “On the Vision and the Riddle” (Vom Gesicht und Räthsel) , the “vision of the loneliest,” a seeing of the abyss, an abysmal seeing, the moment is a “gateway” (Torweg) wherein two paths meet without contra- diction, one stretching back eternally to the past and the other stretching ahead eternally to the future. 86 From this one may deduce that the truth of time, dis- closed always in the time of truth, is not made up of straight lines but rather of what is curved; indeed, in the same section of Nietzsche’s composition we learn that “time itself is a circle” and that just as, from a spatial perspective, the “spirit of gravity” necessitates that what is thrown up must come down, so from a temporal perspective it necessitates that what has come to pass will come to be again, all that has taken place will be cast up by the sea again. 87 In a world of constant change, the only constant is change, the perpetual (un)becoming of the permanent flux of impermanence. 88 Needless to say, there are critical differences between the sixteenth-century Jewish homilist and the nineteenth-century German philosopher, which I do not mean to ignore or to minimize. Nevertheless, Nietzsche’s depiction of the moment as the meeting-point of the eternal past and eternal future provides a useful way to interpret the view articulated by Maharal. Moreover, for both of them, the recurrence of the past in the present entails not a quantifiable and hence predictable repetition of the same, but rather an indeterminable, incal- culable iteration of an original occurrence. Such an iteration of the interminable opens up the possibility of thinking about the relation of time to eternity as decidedly nonbinary, that is, eternity denotes neither timelessness nor the end- less duration of time, but the mutual simultaneity and succession of past, pres- ent, and future in a moment that replicates the identically different, differently identical. 89 The lexical term in the aforecited rabbinic statements that conveys an analogous intemporal traversing of temporal boundaries is ke-illu, “as if,” a semiotic device (employed equally in legal and non-legal, halakhic and aggadic, contexts) that has the analogical power to juxtapose seemingly divergent con- cepts, to connect disparate spheres of being, or to bridge the historical chasm separating two periods of time. 90 In the particular example under discussion, the benchmark set by the rabbis is that one who studies must be able to expe- rience the Sinaitic theophany as if it occurred anew, an experience that is possi- ble only if what is new is experienced as if it were old. The kabbalistic approach to time, which I have elicited from the writings of Cordovero, can be seen legitimately as an embellishment of the rabbinic sensi- bility outlined above. Of the numerous passages that illustrate the point, I have chosen the following comment of Shalom Dovber Schneersohn, the fifth mas- ter of the Lubavitch dynasty, renowned for his sophisticated philosophical pre- sentation of Hasidic lore: Chapter Two 70 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 70"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"By means of Torah and commandments the light of Ein Sof is drawn forth from above the order of concatenation [seder hishtalshelut] , and even above the grade that is the source for the order of concatenation, for even though Torah comes forth from H okhmah, it is known that this is only what comes forth from H okhmah, but in its root it is higher than this, for it extends from the aspect of H okhmah that is in Keter, which is the inwardness of Keter that is above the order of concatenation. Therefore, the Torah is not garbed in time or place, as in the dictum “whoever is engaged in the teachings about the burnt offering, it is as if he sacrificed a burnt offering,” 91 for even though now is not at all the time or place [for offering the sacrifice], even so by means of engagement with the Torah as it pertains to this law, it is as if he actually sacrificed a burnt offering. Since the Torah emanates from Ein Sof, which is above the order of concatenation, it is not garbed at all in time or place. 92 Inasmuch as Torah emanates from Ein Sof, it cannot be subject to the laws of space and time—just as the destruction of the Temple, and the consequent ces- sation of the offering of sacrifices, in no way diminished or altered the expia- tory effectiveness of Jewish ritual. In a rhetorical quip that captures the rabbinic conception of imaginal time, study of the laws pertaining to sacrifices is placed on equal footing with offering sacrifices. The attitude expressed in terms of this particular rite illustrates the larger claim that the timeless character of Torah thwarts the restriction of commandments to spatial or temporal preconditions. Precisely this quality is what necessitates that the quest for meaning ensue time- lessly in time—not as a linear sequence subject to calculation and charting but as a spontaneous flash, a crack in the spatial spread of the timeline, completely in and of the moment—what Sufis call waqt, the instant in which, according to al-Qushayr i , the “dispositions of the real” (tasr i f al- h aqq) come involuntarily and inadvertently upon the person, 93 the interval of time that “consists in efface- ment [ma h w] and confirmation [ithb a t] ,” 94 not as binary opposites but juxtaposed in the space of their difference, the moment effaced in its confirmation, confirmed in its effacement, 95 “the instant of rupture with duration, the return of the same without identity,” 96 a time so fully present it is devoid of (re)pres- entation, so binding it releases one from all causal links to past or future, 97 a split second wherein and wherewith the superfluity of truth divests one of all memory and expectation, 98 the “Time which has (ever) been void of time” in R u m i ’s felicitous expression, 99 or what D o gen called jiji, the temporal occur- rence of each moment, unprecedented, unpredictable, not susceptible to repli- cation, neither cyclical nor linear, 100 the time of dharma’s arising, shih o -kiji, 101 non-duality of “being-time,” uji, permanence of impermanence. 102 For the mystically enlightened, time is not illusory, as some theologians would have it, nor is it dependent solely on the motion of physical bodies, as the philosophers Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 71 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 71"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"would have it, but “it is Eternity itself (‘azl i ’) , time without beginning; and abd i , time without end .... ‘Before-ness’ and ‘after-ness’ of things are only rela- tional; otherwise creation and annihilation are in one and the same moment.

Un/covering of truth is necessarily the contingent re/covery of what is enduringly momentary, for only the enduringly momentary—momentarily at least—reveals the return of the momentarily enduring. 104 No event in time is either completely unique or completely repetitive. The middle path dictates that truth hover between extremes; each moment is the same in virtue of being different, different in virtue of being the same. 105 It lies beyond the scope of this chapter to examine in detail the evolution of this idea in the sources that may have influenced Cordovero, but it is necessary to delve more deeply into his representation of time as the “secret rotation of the emanations.” According to Scholem’s assessment, in contrast to other kab- balists, who “maintained that the concept of time had no application to the pro- cess of emanation,” Cordovero “held that this process occurred within ‘non- temporal time,’ a dimension of time which involved as yet no differentiation into past, present, and future.” 106 The full implication of Scholem’s view can be gleaned from another comment. In support of his (eminently sensible) claim that cosmogony and theogony are two aspects of one continuous reality, the rhythm of creation mirroring the inner movement of divine life, Scholem writes: “The act which results beyond and above time in the transformation of the hidden into the manifest God, is paralleled in the time-bound reality of every other world.” 107 I do not take issue with the main point Scholem is making in the second cita- tion, but his distinction between the world of emanation “above time” and the “time-bound” nature of all the other worlds in the cosmic chain is problematic. Moreover, I am not certain of the defensibility of Scholem’s attempt in the first citation to contrast Cordovero and other kabbalists; it seems to me, by contrast, that the notion of non-temporal time, a time that is before the differentiation of past, present, and future but is time nonetheless, is a‹rmed by many kabbalists and thus should not be trumpeted as a feature that distinguishes Cordovero’s thought. The disagreement is not simply a pedantic squabble between special- ists, but rather involves a central issue in comprehending the religious philoso- phy and worldview promoted by kabbalists. If time is understood exclusively in terms of the material universe, then surely it would be suitable to ascribe to kab- balists the view frequently a‹rmed in philosophical literature that God is, strictly speaking, beyond time (intemporale tempus) and beyond space (illocalis Chapter Two 72 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 72"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"locus) ; 108 just as the divine is omnipresent, everywhere present and hence nowhere present, so God is eternal, not in time but containing all times. 109 As Maimonides, following in the footsteps of Aristotle, put it, “Time is consequent upon motion, and motion is an accident in what is moved.” Since God is not a mutable body, there is no substratum in which the accident of time can inhere. Contemplating a succession of time before the creation of the world, even if that time is the “infinite duration” of God’s existence, is “due to a supposition regarding time or to an imagining of time and not due to the true reality of time. For time is indubitably an accident.” 110 Here it is apposite to mention a passage in which Cordovero articulates a position that resonates with the Maimonidean perspective and would seem therefore to validate Scholem’s claim: “The sefirot preceded the creation of heaven and earth and they do not fall under time [einam noflim ta h at ha-zeman] ; on the contrary, they are the root of time [ hem shoresh el ha-zeman] , for the six sefirot are the root of the six days, and the seventh the day of Sabbath. . . . And concern- ing them the [sages], blessed be their memory, said, 111 ‘This teaches that there was a prior order of time [seder zemannim] .’ ” 112 Cordovero adopts the philosoph- ical approach even more stringently when delineating the difference between Ein Sof and the sefirot: The emanated beings fall under time but he does not fall under time. I do not wish to speak of “time” as it seems from the straightforward meaning of our words, but rather the intent is that there was a time when they had not yet emanated as in “prior to the emanation,” and this is one of the things that cannot be in Ein Sof since he is not an existence that does not exist, but he is the necessary of existence, and he brought about the existence of time and he is not a temporal being. . . . And this is illustrative of the power of the magnitude of Ein Sof, king of kings, blessed be he, for it instructs about his being, which does not fall under time, but, on the contrary, he brings about the existence of time, and the being of his privation cannot be imag- ined in any manner in the world. This is one of his many advantages over his emana- tions for all of them fall under the existence in which there was already a time in which Ein Sof existed apart from them as in “prior to the emanation.” 113 The expression “necessary of existence” (me h uyav ha-me s i’ut) , the technical philosophical designation of God that Maimonides 114 appropriated from Avicenna’s w a jib al-wuj u d, 115 is ascribed to Ein Sof, the one being about whom it can be said unequivocally that its existence is necessary. Insofar as the nonexis- tence of Ein Sof is inconceivable, there can be no time when Ein Sof does not exist, but if there can be no time when Ein Sof does not exist, time cannot be applied meaningfully to Ein Sof. Alternatively, inasmuch as “all existence is Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 73 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 73"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"one” in the nondifferentiated unity of Ein Sof, it follows that “all times are equal,” 116 which is theoretically equivalent to saying that time in its triadic divi- sion does not apply to Ein Sof. Cordovero, and every kabbalist I have studied, would have surely assented to the following comment in the anonymous work, Ma‘arekhet ha-Elohut, composed in all likelihood in the beginning of the fourteenth century by someone from the school of Solomon Ibn Adret, disciple of Na h manides: “The negation of corporeality entails that God is not limited, and not a body or a force in a body, and included in the negation is that [God] is not constricted by place or time, but rather ‘it was, it is, and it shall be’ [ hayah howeh we-yihyeh] .” 117 All corporeality is to be removed from the divine; consequently, God cannot be bound spatially or temporally—in terms of the exegetical gloss on the Tetragrammaton well- attested in medieval rabbinic literature: God is the being who was, is, and will be. 118 To say that God is all three tenses in tandem is equivalent, therefore, to saying that God is beyond temporal ascription. As H ayyim Vi t al, one of the most prominent sixteenth-century kabbalists and a disciple of both Cordovero and Luria, wrote: The great name, which is the Tetragram, YHWH, is called as such to indicate his eternal being and his everlasting existence [ hawwayato ha-ni sh it we-qiyyumo la‘ad] , he was, he is, and he will be [ hayah howeh we-yihyeh] , prior to the creation, during the time of the subsistence of creation, and after it reverts to what it was. And had the worlds and all that is in them not have been created, it would not have been possi- ble to see the truth of the manifestation of his eternal being, blessed be he, in the past, present, and future, and he would not have been called by the name YHWH at all. 119 It seems to me plausible to apply to Ein Sof the description of Durg a -K a l i , the Mother Goddess in Sa kta Hinduism, as “the ultimate trans-theistic symbol of Timelessness — the Not-Time,” on account of which she merits the name A dyak a l a . 120 Leaving aside the important divergence between the Jewish and Indian materials with respect to the gender construction of the formless form of ultimate reality, 121 the characterization of the latter as a “trans-theistic symbol of Timelessness,” the “Not-Time,” 122 well suits the depiction of the infinite in kabbalistic lore: the form of formlessness that transcends all form, even the form of formlessness, the incomprehensible and ineffable (not)being beyond image and word. In this spirit, Cordovero repeatedly insists that the quality of pri- mordiality can be attributed only to Ein Sof, whereas all other entities, includ- ing the sefirot, are considered temporal and contingent in nature. There is, how- ever, a crucial difference between the temporal causality of the sefirot vis-à-vis Ein Chapter Two 74 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 74"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Sof and the temporal causality of matters in the spatio-temporal sphere: in the case of the latter, an interval separates cause and effect, but in the former there can be no such hiatus because that would imply an alteration in the divine will. 123 To avoid the theological problem of suggesting that there is a change in God’s volition, which would attribute to God a state less than perfect, Cordovero utilizes the paradoxical expression et lo et, “moment-that-is-no- moment,” to demarcate the transition from the temporal eternity of Ein Sof, the “primordial being that has no primordiality” (qadmon beli qadmut) , 124 to the eter- nal temporality of the sefirot. 125 Cordovero fervently insists that Judaism, the “faith that believes in creation” (kat ha-ma’aminim be- h iddush) , categorically rejects the possibility of there being anything but Ein Sof prior to the emanation. “Thus we find the truth of his essence alone without any other cause, but rather all the other causes are brought about from him in an absolute creation [ h iddush gamur] , for there was no prior existence at all, God forbid. However, in the time-that- was-no-time and in the moment-that-was-no-moment [ bi-zeman she-eino zeman u- ve-et she-eino et] , he brought about every beginning [ hat h alah] for the created enti- ties, and they have no prior beginning, God forbid, other than Ein Sof alone, for he is the origin [ro’sh] and beginning [ hat h alah] of all that exists.” 126 The temporal eternity of the infinite is depicted as a state of timelessness, in the sense of being not devoid of but rather replete with time, a time in which all moments are indistinguishably the same, a present that has no past that is not future nor future that is not past (a position reminiscent of Augustine as well as of the notion of sempiternitas posited by later Neoplatonists). 127 The eter- nal temporality of the sefirotic emanations, on the other hand, begins in the “moment-that-is-no-moment” — the beginning of time that is marked in this seemingly incongruous phrase, an interval not subject to the contingencies of physical time, the beginning that has no end and consequently no begin- ning. 128 As Cordovero puts it in another passage: “Thus in the beginning of the disclosure of the emanation of the beings from him [te h illat gilluy hitpash t ut ha- nim s a’ot me-itto] there was no moment-that-is-no-moment but rather all the moments were equal [ein et lo et ela kol ha-ittim shawwot] . However, the emanation in the will of wills [hit pash t ut bi-re s on ha-re s onot] was dependent on the moment- that-is-no-moment for it was necessary that the vessel be prepared to receive the emanation.” 129 Cordovero’s perspective was elaborated in the eighteenth century by Joseph Ergas in a passage in the second part of Shomer Emunim where the fictional inter- locutor, Yehoyada—a name, incidentally, that connotes gnosis of God—enun- ciates six principles of faith (iqqarei ha-emunah) to Shealtiel. While explicating the fifth principle, Yehoyada explains why it is legitimate to apply the metaphor of light to the sefirot even though they are spiritual and not physical entities: “Light Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 75 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 75"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"is forever bound to its source and cause, and it does not separate from it. On account of this the sefirot are described as lights, for they proceed and emanate from the divine sun, and they are not separated from it, God forbid, but rather the emanated is forever bound to its source, and the potency of the emanator is continuously in the emanated.” 130 The axiom that the cause is inseparable from the effect of necessity entails the corollary that the effect is inseparable from the cause, 131 and taking both together, it follows that the agency of divine causality cannot be understood in ordinary temporal terms. Ergas articulates this in Yehodaya’s response to Shealtiel’s question concerning why the world was cre- ated at the moment it was and not before: Know that prior to the creation of anything when God, blessed be he, was alone, there was then no reality of time at all [lo hayah az me s i’ut zeman kelal] , for time itself has no reality, as it is an accident that is conjoined to and is consequent to the motion of something that has been generated and continues to exist, for it falls under time and three aspects of time are distinguished with respect to it, namely, past, present, and future. . . . He exists permanently in one manner; before the world was created and after the world will be destroyed, time does not alter him .... And even though he was [ hayah] , is [ howeh] , and will be [ yihyeh] , he has no relation to time, for his having been has not elapsed [ he-hayah shelo lo avar] , his being at present is not momentary [ ha-howeh shelo eino rega] , and his being to come is not in the future [ ha-yihyeh shelo eino attid] . 132 Ergas is adamant that time in its triune division is not applicable to God. Echoing the Aristotelian conception of time, Ergas maintains that time is an accident of a substance that is subject to coming-to-be and passing away. God is impervi- ous to change and hence temporal qualities cannot be attributed to him. From this standpoint, the question regarding why the world was created at a particu- lar moment is erroneous, since prior to the creation there is no before or after and thus no response would be adequate. 133 The traditional understanding of God encompassing past, present, and future concomitantly, which, as noted above, is linked exegetically to the Tetragrammaton, does not challenge the philosophical claim that time cannot be assigned to God, for to say that God was (hayah) , is (howeh) , and will be (yihyeh) does not imply a past that is no more, a present that is short-lived, or a future that has not yet come to pass. In the con- tinuation of the above passage, Ergas cites in support of his view Na h manides’ interpretation of R. Isaac’s remark that the name ehyeh occurs three times in God’s response to Moses (Exod 3:14) to assure Israel that he is the same God who was, is, and will be with them in their historical travails. 134 “The explana- tion of the opinion of R. Isaac,” writes Na h manides, “is that the past and future Chapter Two 76 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 76"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"time are wholly in the Creator in the present, for there is no change or set term in relation to him, 135 and no days at all have passed from him. Therefore, all the tenses [zemannim] in him are designated by one name, which instructs about the necessary of existence [ h iyyuv ha-me s i’ut] .” 136 Na h manides casts the explication attributed to R. Isaac on the name ehyeh in medieval philosophical language: The expression “necessary of existence,” as noted above, is appropriated from Maimonides, for whom the idiom, in con- sort with Avicenna, signifies that God is the one being whose existence is iden- tical with his essence, that is, it cannot be said that God does not exist, and thus existence is not an attribute added to his essence but rather an expression of what unfolds from it. The inseparability of essence and existence precludes the possibility of any change or modification, and hence all three aspects of time converge in the nunc stans of the eternal present. Ergas thus provides an opening to qualify the categorical rejection of ascrib- ing temporal qualities to God. Let me clarify that I am not suggesting that Ergas wavers on the essential point that ordinary or physical time, that is, time sub- ject to quantifiable measure and calibration, cannot be applied to God; on the contrary, he consistently maintains that it is only the imagination that leads human beings to entertain the possibility of time prior to creation; reason, however, discloses the spuriousness of such imaginings, as the divine being is not subject to temporal oscillation. 137 Citing the view of Mena h em Azariah of Fano, Ergas insists that neither “time” (zeman) nor even the “order of time” (seder zemannim) can be attributed in anything but a figurative and imprecise way to the sefirotic potencies. 138 Notwithstanding the validity of this assertion, I still con- tend that Ergas would likely have assented to the distinction between conven- tional time, which is divided into three modalities based on the presumption of the mutability of an immutable subject, and sempiternal time, a time that is not measured by duration or change, common traits associated with matters tem- poral. God’s existence can be characterized, accordingly, as either timeless time or unending time, the former signifying the negative assertion that divine time has no past, present, or future, and the latter the assertive negation that there is no past, present, or future in which God does not exist. Let us consider the following comment on the nature of time and divinity offered by Vi t al: It is known that the supernal light above is without limit and it is called Ein Sof. Its name attests that with respect to it there is no grasping, not in thought [ma h shavah] nor in contemplation [hirhur] at all. He is separate and apart from all thoughts, and he is prior to all things emanated [ne’e s alim] , created [nivra’im] , formed [ye s urim] , and made [na‘asim] , and in him there is no time of origin or beginning [zeman hat h alah we- Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 77 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 77"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"re’shit] , for he exists permanently [tamid] and persists forever [la‘ad] , and in him there is no commencement or termination at all [ro’sh we-sof kelal] . From Ein Sof there emanates subsequently the existence of the great light, which is called Adam Qadmon. ... The emanation of this Adam Qadmon, and all the more so the other worlds beneath him, have a beginning and end, and they have a beginning of the time of their being and their emanation, which is not the case with regard to Ein Sof, as was stated above. From the moment [et] and time [zeman] that the emanation and concatenation of the above-mentioned lights and worlds began, the being of all the existents began, one after the other, until the matter reached existence as it is now, which comes about according to the order of emanation and the concatenation cor- responding to the order of time [seder zemannim] , and it was not possible to advance or to delay the creation of this world, for each and every world was created after the world above it. All the worlds were created, emanated, concatenated, and went forth, one following the other, in various and successive times, one after the other, until the time of the creation of this world arrived, and then it was created in the time appropriate to it after the creation of the supernal worlds above it. 139 In consonance with a long-standing kabbalistic tradition, traceable to the thir- teenth century, Vi t al begins by asserting straightforwardly that Ein Sof is beyond human comprehension. Notwithstanding this unambiguous assertion of ineffa- bility, Vi t al describes Ein Sof as the “supernal light” that is “without limit,” an apophatic utterance that is kataphatic in its apophasis, that is, a negative proposition as opposed to a negation of proposition. 140 Be that as it may, what is crucial for this discussion is Vi t al’s remark that time differentiated by beginning and end can- not be applied to Ein Sof since “he exists permanently and persists forever.” Note the precise language: the eternality of the infinite is not set in opposition to time; it is, rather, the embracing of a sempiternal time that cannot be marked in a linear fashion by commencement or termination, a time that is continuous and everlasting. By contrast, all beings beneath Ein Sof in the ontic chain, begin- ning with Adam Qadmon, can be characterized by beginning and end, and hence time can be positively attributed to them. 141 Not only is the emanation of the sefirot not outside time, it is the paradigmatic pattern of temporality, the order of time (seder zemannim) that gives shape to all that exists. It should be recalled that Cordovero likewise a‹rms an apophatic approach with respect to Ein Sof that makes it impossible to speak about God in tempo- ral terms: “Concerning him we cannot speak or form an image, or ascribe to him either judgment or mercy, rage or anger, change, boundary, or any attrib- ute, neither before the emanation nor now after the emanation.” 142 Elsewhere Cordovero states explicitly that temporal images used to describe the divine potencies must be construed figuratively because “the divinity does not fall Chapter Two 78 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 78"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"beneath time.” In the same context, however, he refers to Tif’eret and Malkhut, respectively the sixth and tenth emanations, as the “essence of the governance” (iqqar ha-hanhagah) and the “order of time” (seder ha-zeman) , “for time comes to be by means of the circumference, which is the waw, the six extremities, and Malkhut is he, the two of them being the attribute of day and the attribute of night. Therefore Tif’eret and Malkhut were in thought prior to the emanation.” 143 The critical expression seder ha-zeman is derived from an aggadic annotation, which Cordovero explicitly cites, on the scriptural refrain “it was evening and it was morning,” wa-yehi erev wa-yehi voqer (Gen 1:5): “R. Judah bar Simon said: It is not written ‘it will be evening’ [ yehi erev] but ‘it was evening’ [wa-yehi erev] . From here [it can be deduced] that there was an order of time [seder zemannim] prior to this.” 144 Underlying this rabbinic teaching is not only the assumption of an existence prior to the creation of the world—an idea reiterated in the teaching of R. Abbahu placed immediately after the dictum of R. Judah that God created worlds and destroyed them until he created this world—but also the conjecture that time is not dependent on the physical universe, or, at least, not on the physical universe of our sentient experience. The fuller ideational back- ground of the rabbinic notion of seder zemannim is not quite obvious. What is clear, however, is that the idea served as grist for the kabbalists’ imagination by providing them with a term to convey the concept of “time out of time,” 145 that is, a time, in Cordovero’s own language, “that has no boundary and no end,” the time of limitless delimitation, delimited in the delimited limitlessness of the ten emanations, the world of unity (olam ha-yi h ud, alma de-yi h uda) . 146 The time of the immeasurable is measured, more specifically, by the lower seven gradations comprising the attributes of day and night, Tif’eret and Malkhut, the last two let- ters of the Tetragrammaton (waw-he) , which existed in thought — that is, H okhmah, the second sefirah represented by the first letter of the name (yod) — prior to their emanation. 147 Time, in its timeless becoming, is expressed most fundamentally in the alternating pattern of night and day, contracting darkness and expanding radiance, gendered respectively as the feminine and masculine aspects of the divine androgyny. 148 Cordovero a‹rms the temporalizing depiction of the sefirotic pleroma, at least the lower seven emanations, in other passages in his literary oeuvre. I cite here one text wherein the liturgical distinctiveness of the Jewish people and their ontological connectedness to the divine is expressed in precisely these terms: The matter of the change of times [shinnuy ha-zemannim] depends on the supernal sefirot and the providence [ hanhagah] that ensues from them to us, for concerning us, the na- tion of the Lord, all our behavior [ hanhagatenu] and our time cycles [gilggulei zemanneinu] , Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 79 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 79"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"we rotate verily by means of the spheres of the emanations [galggallei ha-sefirot] , since we are in the secret of our minds, spirits, and souls, sparks hewn from the light of the emanations [or ha-sefirot] , and all of our effort is to be like that which is above as far as it is possible, to be bound to the supernal roots, to cleave to our Creator as far as it is possible, and this was the intent of our creation as it says “Let us make man in our image and in our likeness. And God created man in his image etc. in the image of God he created him” (Gen 1:26 – 27). 149 Therefore our essence is to become like the supernal emanations . . . and the Torah reveals to us the variations of the emanations [shinnuyei ha-sefirot] and the division of their providential aspects [ h illuqei be h inatam lehanhagatam] , and the holy One, blessed be he, made physical ves- sels like their matter so that through them we could know the supernal providence [ ha-hanhagah ha-elyonah] . And this is what it says “They shall serve as signs for set times — the days and the years” (ibid. 14). He set the seasons of the years [tequfot ha-shanah] and the motions of the stars [mehalkhei ha-kokhavim] so that [we may] know from their signs the supernal providence according to their manner in the land of Israel. 150 Cordovero presents divine providence in the natural world, the overflow from the sefirotic pleroma, in strictly temporal terms. Natural time, the “change of times” (shinnuy ha-zemannim) or the “seasons of the year” (tequfot ha-shanah) , which come to pass according to the motion of the celestial lights, is related to the rit- ual behavior and time cycles (gilggulei zeman) of the Jewish people, which follow the rotations of the emanations (galggallei ha-sefirot) . For Cordovero, echoing a sentiment broadly attested in previous kabbalistic treatises, time in its essential nature, that is, sacred as opposed to mundane time, is a unique property of Jews, for their souls alone are rooted ontically in the sefirotic pleroma, the per- petuity of time in its primordial permutation. Holiness itself is intricately con- nected to the covenantal incision in the fabric of time, undoing the threads of expectation and retention by seizing the moment of what comes to be in hav- ing been. The raison d’être of the people of Israel is to emulate and thereby be conjoined to God, a divine status that guarantees an intrinsic connection between the ceremonial conduct (hanhagah) of the Jews below and the supernal providence (ha-hanhagah ha-elyonah) determined by the emanations above. Tem- poral changes are thus related to the “variations of the emanations” (shinnuyei ha-sefirot) revealed by Torah, which, in the mind of kabbalists, is indistinguish- able from the divine essence encoded in the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet comprised in the Tetragrammaton. 151 In light of these passages, I think it better, contra Scholem, to distinguish two vectors of time according to kabbalistic teaching, one that applies to the physical universe, the world of discriminate beings (olam ha-nifradim, olam ha-perud, alma di- Chapter Two 80 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 80"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"peruda) , and the other to the unfolding of the enfolded light of the divine pleroma, the world of integration (olam ha-yi h ud, alma de-yi h uda) . Surely, I am not advocating a dualism when I speak of two vectors nor do I deny that kabbalistic tradition presumes an analogical relation between the two spheres such that one gains knowledge of the latent from the manifest and of the manifest from the latent— an ancient Hermetic teaching with roots in Platonic philosophy that had a pro- found impact on the esoteric teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as they evolved in the Middle Ages. It is worthwhile mentioning one extract from Cordovero where he frames the kabbalistic teaching in these terms: “From the lower beings we discern the supernal beings, as it says ‘From my flesh I would behold God’ (Job 19:26), and by means of them a man can discern divinity. After a man contemplates the supernal beings from the lower beings, he will return from above to below, and he will discern the greatness of the lower beings for they are dependent on the supernal beings; hence the order of the comprehension of hidden matters is from posterior [ ha-me’u h ar] to anterior [ ha- qodem] and subsequently from anterior [ ha-qodem] to posterior [me’u h ar] .” 152 In the cosmological progression, the world of emanation (a s ilut) is “prior” to the worlds of creation (beri’ah) , formation (ye s irah) , and doing (asiyyah) , but from the epistemic point of view, buttressed by the ontic presumption of a continu- ous chain of being extending from and unified within the supreme “cause of all causes” (sibbat kol ha-sibbot) , knowledge of the sefirot is adduced from the cosmos. The hierarchical relation is problematized, however, by the fact that the mun- dane is discerned from the divine in the same measure that the divine is dis- cerned from the mundane. The subversion of the hierarchy is expressed in the inversion of chronological time a‹rmed at the conclusion of the passage in lan- guage reminiscent of the hermeneutical dictum discussed above: ein muqdam u-me’u h ar ba-torah. Just as the reader need not assume an absolute temporal order operative in Scripture that would prevent undermining the criterion of before and after, so one need not presume that in the nature of existence anterior and posterior are aligned in an unwavering causal relationship. Encircling the linear pattern holds the key to comprehending the kabbalistic notion of timeless time, the time-devoid-of-time, that is, the void of time that engenders the time of void that reverses the sequential pattern of antecedent and corollary. If we were to consider temporality only from the perspective of the corpo- real world, then we would have to uphold Scholem’s point that for kabbalists the realm of emanation is not subject to time. However, there is no reason to be so restricted, as we can plausibly speak of another dimension of temporality, a “metaphysical” as opposed to “physical” conception of time that well applies to the eternal; 153 indeed, I would go so far as to say that in kabbalistic teaching, time in its primordiality is not extrinsic to God but is the radiance of divine Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 81 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 81"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"becoming recounted in the narratological telling of enumerated iteration. The twofold depiction of the sefirot as line and circle 154 suggests that the interminable telling of the timeless time proceeds linearly but in a succession that is subject to disruption by the eruption of the cycle of the eternal return of the moment that has perpetually never been. In this linear circularity, the emanations “are unified in a true unity in their connecting beginning to end and end to begin- ning,” 155 and hence the distinction between beginning and end is destabilized. The comment just cited is from a passage in Cordovero’s Pardes Rimmonim where he interprets the depiction of the sefirot in the first part of Sefer Ye s irah, “their end is fixed in their beginning and their beginning in their end” (na‘u s sofan bi-te h illatan u-te h illatan be-sofan) . 156 This uroboric symbol notionally and visu- ally conveys the fusion of the linear and cyclical, the innovative and repetitive. In one of the earliest kabbalistic commentaries on Sefer Ye s irah, a text that pre- serves the teachings of the Provençal master Isaac the Blind, 157 one can already find an articulation of the notion of time connected to the paradoxical image of the end fixed in the beginning: “A wellspring that spreads forth — all that spreads forth is from the source, and if the source ceases, everything ceases, and since they emanate in every moment [ be-khol et] , the beginning has no end [te h illah ein lah sof] . Therefore it says ‘their end in their beginning.’ ” 158 In his own commentary on Sefer Ye s irah, Cordovero elucidates the matter of “the bond of the emanations, the first in the last and the last in the first [qesher ha-sefirot ri’shon be- sofan we-sofan be-ri’shon] ,” in terms of his doctrine of the two types of light: the “straight light,” or yashar, that issues from Keter to Malkhut, and the “restored light,” or h ozer, that is reflected back from Malkhut to Keter: 159 “This is the way the wheel turns and rotates without end or limit [we-khen derekh ha-galggal h ozer u-mitggalggel ad ein sof we-takhlit] .” 160 Needless to say, the turning and rotating suggest a circular motion indicative of the sefirotic activity, but the forms of the straight and restored light by which the latter is also described are manifestly linear. Insofar as the world of discrete entities continues to exist, a condition to which Cordovero refers in blatantly apocalyptic terms—“as long as the world is impaired on account of the filth of the serpent and the shell [kol od she-ha-olam be-qilqul me-zohamat ha-na h ash we-ha- qelippah] ”— the providential power of God is manifest under the guise of the “time of action,” zeman ha-ma‘aseh, which fluctuates in accord with the dual movement of procession and return. However, when the semblance of all par- ticularity is annihilated and everything is brought back to the primal unity of nondifferentiation, then the “time of action” gives way to the “time of perpe- tuity,” zeman ha-qiyyum, the “time of resurrection,” zeman ha-te h iyyah, 161 that is, the time of eternity, the eternal time, so resolute that it timelessly endures the dura- tion of time, extending circuitously, revolving sequentially.

In the language of one zoharic passage: “R. H ezeqiah began to expound and said, ‘There is a time for everything, and a moment for every desire under heaven’ (Eccles 3:1). Come and see: With respect to everything that the holy One, blessed be he, made below, he established a fixed instant and time .... What is [the meaning of ] ‘a moment for every desire?’ A time and occasion for everything, for the whole of the will that is found below.” 165 A‹xed to every temporal event below is an appropriate time above that expresses the eternal will as revealed in the procession of the sefirotic potencies from the infinite. Time and eternity, accordingly, are to be construed not as log- ical antinomies resolved by a dialectic synthesis that effaces difference in the a‹rmation of the nonidentity of identity but as ontic variations held together in the identity of nonidentity, an indifference that preserves the distinctiveness of one and the other, the time of eternity manifestly concealed in the eternity of time. 166 Already in Sefer ha-Bahir, long considered one of the most important early tex- tual aggregates to espouse the mytho-theosophic orientation that has been identified as the singular contribution of the medieval kabbalistic tradition, the days of creation are interpreted as semiotic ciphers of the divine attributes. 167 Building on the ancient wisdom transmitted in the Bahir, subsequent kabbalists made a point of locating the ontological root of time more specifically in the seven lower attributes, designated sefirot ha-binyan, “emanations of the edifice,” 168 that is, the potencies that correspond to the temporal dimensions of finitude, which are sometimes called yamim ri’shonim, “primordial days” (Deut 4:32), 169 Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 83 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 83"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"yemot olam, “days of old” (ibid. 32:7), 170 or, in the language of the zoharic kab- balists based on these earlier formulations, yomin ila’in, “supernal days,” 171 and yomin qadma’in, “primeval days.” 172 The tenor of this temporality is brought into clearer focus in the following passage from the thirteenth-century work Sefer ha-Yi h ud by the Provençal kabbal- ist Asher ben David: On the basis of the tradition all of these attributes in the six extremities are also called “garden” [gan] , as it says, “The Lord God planted a garden in Eden in the east” (Gen 2:8), that is to say, from before [mi-qedem] 173 the creation of the world . . . and, in truth, Eden refers to H okhmah, the inception of all the emanations [ro’sh le-khol ha-sefirot] , which is intimated in the word bere’shit (ibid., 1:1), and the Targum Yerushalmi translates it as be- h okhmata [“by means of wisdom”], and the rabbis, blessed be their memory, said, 174 “even [the word] bere’shit is [to be considered] a saying” [in the tally of the ten sayings by means of which the world was created]. Hence, Eden is the inner Wisdom [ ha- h okhmah ha-penimit] in which are engraved the thirty-two paths of wisdom, and it is like a spring and like the root for all of them and for the garden. And the garden is like a tree that has many branches, from its head to its foundation, and it is nourished constantly from the root, which is the spring that comes forth from Ein Sof, and it spreads forth from the source without separation and without cessation, without day or hour, even a second, and this is the intent of what is written “the river goes forth from Eden to irrigate the garden” (Gen 2:10). River [nahar] is from nehora, and this is the inner light [ ha-or ha-penimi] that issues constantly from Eden. Therefore it says “goes forth” [yo s e] and it did not say “went forth” [ya s a] for it does not cease, and in every moment it emanates in the attributes [we-khol et hu mitpashe t ba-middot] . 175 Along similar lines, Azriel of Gerona applied the rabbinic idiom seder zemannim to the sefirotic emanations as they are the “designs of creation,” sidrei bere’shit, manifest in the phenomenal plane of existence: “The order of the emanations [seder ha-sefirot] , which is a boundary without boundary [gevul mi-beli gevul] , is called 176 in Bere’shit Rabbah the ‘order of time’ [seder zemannim] , as the rabbis, blessed be their memory, said [the verse] ‘it was evening and it was morning’ [wa-yehi erev wa-yehi voqer] indicates that there was an order of time before this, 177 and they are called the ‘designs of creation’ [sidrei bere’shit] .” 178 The divine ema- nations — whether understood in essentialist or instrumentalist terms — embrace a fundamental paradox enunciated in Azriel’s evocative expression gevul mi-beli gevul, “boundary without boundary,” that is, the sefirot are bounded from the perspective of being limited in number—they are ten and not eleven, ten and not nine, and so forth — but they are unbounded inasmuch as they embody/enclothe the light of the infinite. 179 Analogously, the expression seder Chapter Two 84 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 84"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"zemannim communicates the paradox in temporal terms: the sefirot may be described as time without time, a fourth dimension of time beyond the three- dimensionality of mundane time. 180 The matter is clarified in another remark by Azriel in his commentary on select talmudic legends. In consonance with one of the standard philosophical approaches that prevailed in the Middle Ages, Azriel asserts that “time [zeman] is in the class of things that are created, and before the world was created there was no moment [et] and no time [zeman] .” How, then, he asks, is one to under- stand the words “a source of delight [sha‘ashu‘im] every day [ yom yom] ” (Prov 8:30), the prooftext utilized in rabbinic dicta 181 to anchor the idea that the Torah was created two thousand years prior to the world’s coming into being? Those days are not the days of humanity [ yemei adam] , for the measure [middah] of the days of humanity was not yet made, and those days were from the days whence are the years that cannot be probed, as it is written, “God is greater than we can know; the number of his years cannot be counted” (Job 36:26), and it is written, “Are your days the days of a mortal, are your days the years of a man?” (ibid., 10:5). Rather, when it arose in thought to bring the will that does not cease [ha- ra s on she-eino poseq] into actuality [le-ma‘aseh] , the Torah was created, which preceded [the world] by two thousand years, which are the two days. . . . These years and days that cannot be probed already were prior to the apportioning of the splendor of wisdom to create therefrom the Torah that comprises its paths . . . and in its power are found the moments [ittim] and times [zemannim] that are for the need of this world .... It says in Bere’shit Rabbah, “R. Judah bar Simon said: It does not say ‘let it be evening,’ but rather ‘and it was evening.’ From here [we can deduce that] there was an antecedent order of time [seder zemannim] .” The order of time refers to the years that cannot be probed, as it says, “your years never end” (Ps 102:28). . . . And the import of seder zemannim according to the opinion of the sages is that the order does not cease since they emanate from a cause that does not cease, but the finite times [ ha-zemannim ha-mugbbalim] cease since they are from the potency of a finite order [seder mugbbal] , and they resort to being as they were initially, and thus it will be permanently, for in their end they return to their beginning. 182 At first glance, it would appear that the distance separating the divine and mundane modes of temporality is not traversable: The time that can be spoken of in conjunction with the sefirot is a time/less time, a time that is the measure of the immeasurable stream issuing forth without pause from the infinite source; by contrast, the time ascribed to corporeal bodies is, like the bodies themselves, finite. Yet there is one aspect of the latter that mirrors the former: the circular quality of the lifecycle, the trajectory extending backward to the beginning that reverts forward to the end. In another passage, which may have Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 85 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 85"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"been the fitting continuation of the above citation, 183 Azriel explicates the fol- lowing midrashic comment on the verse “On the day that Moses finished” (Num 7:1): “Rav said that in every place where it says ‘and it was’ [wa-yehi] , it refers to something that stops for many days and it returns to what it was.” 184 According to Azriel, “From here we can learn that even though the times cease because they have reached the end of their limit, and they cease in the cessation of everything finite, the order that causes them does not cease from being, for there is no end to its cause, and even the finite times [ ha-zemannim ha-mugbbalim] revert to what they were, and it causes them to return to their beginning.” 185 For Azriel, then, seder zemannim is interpreted as a terminus technicus to denote what I have been calling timeless time, the measure of the order of the sefirot that “does not cease since they emanate from the cause that does not cease, but the finite times cease since they are from a finite order, and they revert to what they were in the beginning, and thus it is permanently such that in their end they return to their beginning.” 186 Mundane time approximates the ceaselessness of timeless time in the nature of cosmic cyclicality, things returning in their end to their beginning, the luminal emanations themselves often depicted in medi- eval kabbalistic literature by the description of the sefirot in Sefer Ye s irah men- tioned above: “their end is fixed in their beginning and their beginning in their end.” In the final remark concerning the “permanent” return of all things to their beginning, Azriel alludes to the eschatological doctrine of apokastasis, the return of the many to the one, which, in this context, is formulated in tempo- ral terms. 187 However, as Azriel explicitly notes in another passage, it is possible to view the lower sefirot through the prisms of place (maqom) and time (zeman) , attested, for instance, in the fact that they are referred to as “seven extremities of place,” sheva qe s awwot maqom, 188 and/or as “seven days of creation,” shiv‘at yemei bere’shit. 189 From this vantage point, time and space cannot be separated. 190 Certainly, no kabbalist would predicate either space or time as coordinates of the physical world to God, since God is thought to be beyond the material universe. 191 But there is an alternative understanding of space and time that emerges from using spatial and temporal metaphors to describe the divine; indeed, for the kabbal- ist, time and space in the mundane sphere should ideally be understood from this symbolic perspective. The realm of sefirotic potencies is constructed imag- inally as a continuum of events that can be envisioned either as an externaliza- tion of the internal or as an internalization of the external, the former yielding the idea of space that is without boundary and the latter the idea of time that is without limit. A formulation of the early-romantic poet Novalis is especially pertinent, even though it obviously reflects a different hermeneutical perspec- tive: Zeit ist innerer Raum—Raum ist aüßere Zeit, “Time is inner space—space is external Chapter Two 86 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 86"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"time. ” 192 The dimensionality of each instant/point charted in the timespace of the sefirotic graph can be demarcated as the duration of a blink or the extension of a swerve. Temporal Ontology/Eventful Grammar The correlation of the seven days of creation with the seven lower sefirot, widely attested in kabbalistic literature, seems to suggest that the upper three sefirot tran- scend temporal classification altogether. T odros Abulafia, a Castilian kabbalist active in the second half of the thirteenth century (possibly a member of the zoharic circle, perhaps even the historical model for the fictional master of the imaginary fraternity Simeon ben Yo h ai, known honorifically by the acronym Rashbi) 193 appears to have adopted this view: “It is known that the sefirot are called ‘days’ [ yamim] and they are called ‘sayings’ [ma’amarot] . There is no day that can be applied to the first three, but six of them correspond to the days of creation in which all supernal things emerged from potentiality to actuality and corresponding to them in the lower things, and the seventh is the ‘sabbath to the Lord’ (Exod 20:10) ‘for in it he rested from all his labor’ (Gen 2:3).” 194 What inspired this comment is the obvious discrepancy between two symbolic images applied to the divine emanations: the biblical motif of the seven days of cre- ation, on the one hand, and the rabbinic doctrine of the ten sayings by which the world was created, on the other. How can the emanations be called both “days” and “sayings” when there are seven of the former and ten of the latter? To maintain the symmetry of the two symbolic grids, not to mention avoiding a division within the Godhead, a single rubric is needed that combines the char- acteristic of time implied by the concept of “days” and the characteristic of lan- guage implied by the concept of “sayings”—an ontology of temporality that discloses a grammar of eventuality. Precisely at the coupling of the temporal and linguistic, the autogenesis of that which always is, which fosters the redemptive possibility of return to what has never been, must be thought. Not surprisingly, some kabbalists have explicitly maintained that the concept of time extends to all ten sefirot. An interesting formulation of this idea is found in Joseph Karo’s sixteenth-century mystical diary, Maggid Mesharim, in a passage on the traditional qaddish prayer. Commenting on the words “in your days,” Karo writes of “the unifications of the sefirot, which are called ‘days,’ that is, the flux of life in Tif’eret, and from there is the overflow of life to all the sefirot and through this they are all unified.” Even more telling is Karo’s interpretation of the words “in a proximate time”: “in the drawing close and union of the sefirot, which are called ‘time’ [zeman] , in the secret of ‘this instructs that there was an order of time [seder zemannim] before this,’ which is said about the sefirot. ” 195 Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 87 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 87"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"In a second passage from his diary, Karo elaborates on the conception of divine temporality as it relates to the issue of ritual purification of the leper: If so the import of “in the day of his cleansing” (Lev 14:2) is that on the day that his cleansing is attained he will be cleansed, for matters are not renewed each day, as it says, “There is a time for everything, and a moment for every desire” (Eccles 3:1), that is, all the emanations overflow to Yesod, for “everything” [kol] refers to Yesod, and “time” [zeman] refers to the sefirot that are above it in the secret of [the rabbinic dictum] “this teaches that there was an order of time [seder zemannim] prior to this.” And the “moment” [et] refers to the Assembly of Israel [kenesset yisra’el] , and “desire” [ h efe s ] refers to the sefirot above her, that is, an overflow comes to the Assem- bly of Israel from the sefirot that are above her. Thus there are days and gradations designated for this matter and others for other matters. And this is [the import of ] “under heaven” [ta h at ha-shamayim] (Eccles 3:1), that is, in the seven emanations of the edifice [sefirot ha-binyan] that are beneath the supernal heavens, which are the three upper ones, for there everything is unified and there is no differentiation of gradations [perishu de-darggin] . 196 Karo presents the emanative overflow from above to below as a temporal pro- cess, linking it specifically to the verse la-kol zeman we-et le-khol h efe s ta h at ha- shamayim, “There is a time for everything, and a moment for every desire under heaven” (Eccles 3:1). Parsing the verse kabbalistically, Karo remarks that zeman, “time,” denotes the influx of light to Yesod, designated by the term kol, an idea he connects (following much older sources) with the rabbinic notion of seder zemannim, the order of time prior to creation. Karo also deduces from this verse that Shekhinah is et, the “moment,” which likewise receives the influx from above, the desire ( h efe s ) expressive of the execution of the divine will. The sefirotic pleroma is thus divided: the lower seven, which correspond to the days of creation, are marked by the transition from night to day, whereas the upper three are unified in a manner beyond differentiation, a time that allows for no temporal distinctions. To illustrate the point, I will cite and analyze a passage from Pit h ei She‘arim, a treatise composed by the nineteenth-century Lithuanian kabbalist Yi sh aq Isaac H aver, that highlights the nexus of temporality and textuality in the theosophic ruminations of the Gaon of Vilna briefly alluded to above. 197 This is the principle of time, which is divided into three stages, past, future, and present, and there are three books by means of which the world was created, which are the three names of YHWH, for each book [sefer] is a name [shem] ... and this is the secret of the threefold Torah. It says, “days were formed” (Ps 139:16), the Chapter Two 88 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 88"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"secret of created time, the seven days of creation, wherein everything is contained [ ha-kol bi-khelal] ... and they are dependent on the six primordial ones. These are alluded to in the seven words of the verse “In the beginning etc.” (Gen 1:1), and from there volition is suspended. “And to him one belongs” (ibid.), 198 the secret of the first three aspects of the head-that-is-not-known, for there he is above time [le-ma‘alah me-ha-zeman] and there he is in the secret of the unity [sod ha-yi h ud] , for the revealed time [ ha-zeman ha-galuy] of the six days of creation is hidden there in the alef, for, as it is known, alef is the most hidden of all the letters, and it instructs about the secret of the unity of the three aspects of the head-that-is-not-known concerning which there is no comprehension. Thus, the Torah did not begin with alef but with beit, bere’shit, for it is from the secret of the lower seven aspects of Atiq and below. Therefore [the word lo ] is vocalized orally with a waw, and it is written with an alef, in thought and not in speech. 199 The long-standing assumption on the part of kabbalists that time depicts the dynamic recounting of the divine potencies is expressed here through the sym- bolic correlation of the three tenses of time, the threefold repetition of the Tetragrammaton, and the three books by means of which the world was cre- ated—an idea based on the numerical equivalence of sefer, “book,” and shem, “name,” that is, both words equal 340, and also on the opening paragraph of Sefer Ye s irah, where it is stated that God created the world by means of three books. 200 The triadic temporal structure is associated as well with the rabbinic idiom oryan telita’ah, “threefold Torah.” 201 Use of this terminology is predicated no doubt on the presumed identity of Torah and God, a belief a‹rmed axiomatically by kabbalists through the ages. Insofar as Torah is identical with God, it follows that the three divisions of Scripture depict a triunity within the divine. In the beginning of the section from which the above citation is extracted, H aver distinguishes between the upper three and lower seven aspects of the highest configuration of God, which is called Atiq, the “ancient one.” In the upper three, designated (following zoharic jargon) 202 the “head-that-is-not- known,” are “fixed” the “temporal deportment everlastingly [ hanhagat ha-zeman le-ni sh iyyut] since they rise to the secret of the primal anthropos [adam qadmon] in which there is a disclosure of the unity in truth [gilluy ha-yi h ud be-emet] .” In the place of Atiq, we can locate the attributes of knowledge (yedi‘ah) and volition (be h irah) , which are described en passant as objects that the “wise of heart” ( h akhmei lev) desire. Concerning the former, we can only say that it is inscrutable and thus is associated symbolically with the upper three aspects. By contrast, volition is linked to the lower seven aspects, for it stems “from the secret of the union of forty-five and fifty-two that is in each and every soul.” Forty-five and Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 89 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 89"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"fifty-two connote two permutations of YHWH, ywd he waw he (10+6+4 5+1 6+1+6 5+1) and ywd hh ww hh (10+6+4 5+5 6+6 5+5)—two gesticulations of the name that correspondingly symbolize overflowing masculine mercy and constricting feminine judgment. The temporalizing of the supernal will is man- ifest in the dyad of gender dimorphism, 203 but the male and female potencies comprise the lower seven aspects, which correspond to the seven days of cre- ation, also associated with seven of the eight kings of Edom. In contrast to the lower seven, in the upper three the “temporal deportment” (hanhagat ha-zeman) , which is identified as well as the “root of time” (shoresh ha-zeman) , is fixed ever- lastingly. In that root, temporality and eternality are set not as polar opposites but as two facets of one reality. Another passage from Pit h ei She‘arim elaborates upon this matter: In every day new emendations are produced, and after all the emendations are ex- pended, then the six thousand years will be completed, and they will all ascend to the Mother in the seventh millennium, to the secret of eternality [sod ha-ni sh iyyut] , and there they will receive their reward and they will rise from level to level until Arikh Anpin who is above time, for his growth is not by way of time as in the case of Ze‘eir Anpin. The division of time into five gradations — minutes, hours, days, months, and years — is a deep matter, for time is in the male and female, the secret of the forty-five and fifty-two. 204 Kabbalistically interpreting the eschatological conception of the cosmic sabbat- ical cycle transmitted in the name of R. Qa t ina—six thousand years of history followed by a thousand years of desolation 205 — H aver characterizes the seventh millennium as the elevation of everything to the mother, a standard designation of the third emanation, Binah, the womb whence the lower seven sefirot emerge and whither they shall return. A similar account of the eschatological return of everything to Binah in the seventh millennium is presented in the commentary on Sifra di- S eni‘uta attributed to Elijah ben Solomon: The matter is that the six thousand years are the six days wherein the six extremities [ H esed to Yesod] are operative, and the seventh is Malkhut, and Malkhut depends on Binah, and she returns to her source. And this is the secret of Sabbath and the sabbatical year [sod ha-shabbat u-shemi tt ah] in which work is forbidden, and the secret of the Jubilee [sod ha-yovel] ... and the world-to-come, which is in the secret of A t arah returning to Binah, and she is “the woman of valor, crown of her husband” (Prov 12:14). Then Binah rules and everything returns to Binah, to the womb of their mother, and this is the secret of the destruction of this world [ h urban ha-olam ha-zeh] , which is governed by Chapter Two 90 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 90"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"means of Binah, the supernal world. . . . Thus in the end of the sixth millennium all of them are rectified by means of the eighth king, 206 the mercy that is revealed in the world, and afterwards in the seventh millennium all of them will return to their mother, and the earth will be destroyed for it will be restored to its mother. . . . And this is the secret of Sabbath, but Sabbath does not return to her root, to Binah, but rather Binah illumines her, not by means of the six extremities, the six days of creation, and she is equivalent to her, and thus the time for copulation [zeman ha- ziwwug] is in it. The world-to-come, however, is in the pattern of Yom Kippur . . . and then the righteous sit with their crowns on their heads, 207 the “crown of her husband” [a t eret ba‘lah] , and then there is no eating, no drinking, no procreation, as on Yom Kippur, the gradation of Binah, as it says in the Tiqqunim, 208 for then she is in the secret of the crown [taga] , a diadem on the head, and “whoever makes use of the crown perishes” [we-khol ha-mishttammesh be-taga h alaf] , 209 for there is no inter- course [shimmush] when Malkhut is on the head of her husband, and there are no new souls, therefore “there is in it no eating etc.” And this is the secret of “the earth was destroyed,” and Binah remains alone, for all of them are concealed in her midst. 210 The eschatological state of redemption characteristic of the seventh millen- nium, the cosmic Sabbath or desolation that follows the cycle of six millennia, is depicted both as the return of all things to the womb of Binah, the maternal fountainhead in the sefirotic pleroma, and as the elevation of Malkhut to the head of her husband. The latter image conveys the asceticism appropriate to redemp- tion, a point underscored by the symbolic connection between Binah, the world- to-come, and Yom Kippur. In her transformed condition, the female is a crown on the male rather than a separate vessel to receive the seminal fluid, and con- sequently there is no intercourse. The transposition of the female to the status of the crown signifies, therefore, the ascetic eroticism suitable to the final phase of salvation. 211 The temporal dimension of this transmutation is underscored by the fact that the seventh millennium is associated with the “secret of eternality,” the cosmic Sabbath, attained with the restitution of the six millennia, which correspond typologically to the six days of creation, to their ontic source, an ascent that culminates not with Binah but with Arikh Anpin, literally the “long- faced” and metaphorically the “long-suffering,” the supreme manifestation of the Godhead, Keter, which is “above time.” The “root of time” is positioned in Ze‘eir Anpin, literally the “short-faced” and metaphorically the “impatient,” the lower gradation, which, in contrast to Arikh Anpin, is characterized by the oppo- sition of left and right, judgment and mercy, female and male, night and day. We may deduce from this that temporality is inherently connected to a binary structure, the fluctuation from darkness to light, engendered in kabbal- istic literature respectively as feminine and masculine, whereas the attribute Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 91 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 91"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"that is beyond polarity and the dimorphic interplay of gender, the moment/ place characterized by the coincidence of opposites, is above time.

An allusion to this conception of time-that-is-no-time, the time/less time of the moment that is all-time, is found in a remark from Tiqqunei Zohar, the literary stratum of zoharic literature, composed in all likelihood in the first half of the fourteenth century in Castile. This passage occurs in an exposition of the theo- sophic principle (well-entrenched by the time of this text’s composition) that the various names of God are correlated with different limbs of the “imaginal body,” a term I have employed to describe the constellation of sefirot as they are visually configured in the kabbalist’s imagination: Ehyeh [Keter] [is set] atop being [al hawayah] , and this breath-of-the-heart [ hevel de-libba] governs 213 the voice of YHWH [Tif’eret] ; it is the cause of all causes [illat al kol ha - illot] , hidden and concealed, and it is not revealed, and it governs and rules [rakhiv u-shali t ] over everything. Ehyeh indicates that the cause of causes [illat ha-illot] was, is, and shall be [ hayah howeh we-yihyeh] , and it is the breath that rises to Ein-Sof by means of which the cause of all causes governs [ hevel de-saliq ad ein sof u-veih rakhiv illat al kol ha-illot] . 214 Without exaggeration one could devote a whole chapter to the elucidation of this passage. Withstanding that temptation, however, I will confine my remarks to points most essential to our analysis. The name ehyeh, which is assigned to Keter, uppermost of the ten emanations, is described as “atop being,” al hawayah. The term hawayah may have a twofold signification in this context: first, as a generic noun that denotes the composite of being as such, that is, the being that comprises all beings, and second, as a proper name assigned to that which can have no proper name, the (in)effable name, shem ha-meforash, the Tetragram- maton (yhwh consists of the same letters as hwyh) , though in this case, as in numerous others, ascribed to Tif’eret. This interpretation is confirmed by the continuation whence we learn that Keter is the breath-of-the-heart, hevel de-libba, Chapter Two 92 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 92"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"which governs the “voice of the Tetragrammaton,” qol yhwh, a symbolic refer- ence to Tif’eret. Ehyeh is, moreover, the supernal cause that executes providence over (literally, “rides upon”) all that exists, the supreme concealment that shows the way to the infinite, designated “cause of causes” (illat ha-illot) in an effort to distinguish the ontic foundation from Keter, which is designated “cause of all causes” (illat kol ha-illot) . The first of the emanations renders visible an aspect of Ein Sof inasmuch as it conveys the paradoxical compresence of the three tenses comprised in the name; that is, the ineffable name, whether declaimed as ehyeh or as yhwh, alludes symbolically to the fact that, in the infinite, was, is, and will be, hayah howeh we-yihyeh, past, present, and future, are unified— the mystery of the threefold unity that is a unified trinity, a mystery appre- hended as mystery by the spirit carried on the wings of the upward breath, the breath-of-the-heart, that ascends to and vanishes in the impenetrable infinite. 215 The conception of temporality proffered in the aforecited passage is enhanced by considering the interpretation of this passage found in the commentary on Tiqqunei Zohar that purports to transmit the teachings of the Vilna Gaon: “ Ehyeh is upon hawayah, ” that is to say, upon being [al me s i’ut] , for ehyeh connotes being [ hu leshon me s i’ut] , and as the commentators have explained, the verse ehyeh asher ehyeh (Exod 3:14) instructs about what was, is, and shall be [moreh al hayah howeh we-yihyeh] . That is to say, ehyeh is iterated there three times, as it says, ehyeh asher ehyeh, “I was with you etc. and I shall be with you etc.” 216 And afterwards it says, “ ehyeh [sent me to you]” (ibid.), this [alludes to] the redemption in the present [ ha-ge’ullah be-howeh] . 217 The name ehyeh, in particular, illumines the secret of time as it demarcates the junction of eternality and temporality instantiated in the moment wherein past, present, and future are no longer distinguishable. The Gaon of Vilna percep- tively remarked that the third occurrence of ehyeh alludes symbolically to “the redemption in the present.” The intent of this comment, I propose, is that sal- vation beckons the release from time through time. 218 The paradoxical nature of the intemporal temporality exhibited by Keter is captured as well in the observation of Mena h em Azariah of Fano that the num- ber seven is linked to the “seven primordial kings,” which are designated the beginning of the aspect of time in the supernal beings [te h illah li-ve h inat ha-zeman ba- elyonim] , as it is written, “inquire about the first days” (Deut 4:32), and above them are H okhmah and Binah, concerning which the Torah said “I was a delight every day” (Prov 8:30), in the secret of the day of the holy One, blessed be he, consisting of one thousand years, thus the Torah preceded the world by two thousand years, Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 93 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 93"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"and these are the order of the times [seder zemannim] specified by the Torah without doubt, for Keter has no relation whatsoever to the aspect of time on account of its hiddenness, and this is a reason why [the word] bere’shit is also a saying [ma’amar] , for it is naught but the principle [kelal] of what consequent to it is action [ma‘aseh] . 219 The lower seven sefirot correspond to the seven days of creation, Binah and H okhmah to the order of time (or the two thousand years) prior to the creation, and Keter to the principle (kelal) of action (ma‘aseh) that is before any and all dif- ferentiation—the first of the ten sayings (ma’amarot) by means of which God cre- ated the world, according to the ancient rabbinic teaching, which were inter- preted kabbalistically as one of the symbolic ways to depict the ten gradations of the pleromatic fullness of divine wisdom. Significantly, Keter is encoded in the opening word of Torah, bere’shit, “in/at the beginning,” the primary utterance that contains the other nine utterances, the boundless will manifestly hidden in the temporal unfolding of the eternally enfolded light hiddenly manifest in the eternal enfolding of the temporally unfolded light. Time proceeds timelessly from the beginningless inception of the origin coterminous with the before that has no after but the after that has no before. We can gain a better sense of this notion of time-that-is-no-time from the following remark of David ben Yehudah he- H asid, another kabbalist who may have been part of the circle responsible for the early stage of the literary pro- duction of the zoharic anthology: 220 The secret of the venerable prayer is that it grows stronger, and it ascends from sefirah to sefirah until it reaches the will [ra s on] that is conjoined to Keter. Therefore it is said at the end [of the prayer] yihyu le-ra s on imrei fi (Ps 19:15). When prayer reaches the place of the will [meqom ha-ra s on] , then all the gates from above to below are opened before him, and there is no obstacle or impediment to his demands, for he is conjoined to the world of mercy [olam ha-ra h amim] and, consequently, he can exact all his needs and requests. There is nothing opposing him for he draws forth from the source of the will [meqor ha-ra s on] , and he is able to renew new miracles and wonders [le h addesh otot u-moftim h addashim] as if in that very hour [sha‘ah] the world were created, and nothing stands opposing him. This is the secret of the dictum of the rabbis, blessed be their memory, “Progeny, livelihood, and sustenance are not dependent on merit [zekhuta] but on fortune [mazzla] , 221 for everything depends on the world of mercy, which is the source. 222 Through the weave of rabbinic and mystical themes that make up the fabric of this text, the reader is afforded an opportunity to contemplate some of the key hermeneutical assumptions that have informed the kabbalistic ontology of Chapter Two 94 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 94"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"time. The initial thing to note is the nexus between temporality and prayer 223 — if one plumbs the depth of the mystery of worship, one will comprehend the dynamics of time, a theme to which I return below. Reiterating what was by his time the standard kabbalistic understanding of prayer, David ben Yehudah char- acterizes the liturgical rite as an ascent of the worshipper’s will through the sefirotic pleroma to the will that is conjoined with Keter. This will is the expres- sion of the infinite potency of Ein Sof in the ten sefirotic gradations whence it overflows to the chain of being that extends from the angelic to the mundane worlds. 224 The mystical dimension of prayer, therefore, entails the contempla- tive elevation of the will to the “source of the will” (maqor ha-ra s on) , the dimen- sion of infinity that is manifest in Keter. The telos of worship is captured in the words from Psalm 19:15, yihyu le-ra s on imrei fi, “May the words of my mouth be acceptable to you,” which are part of the meditation recited after the amidah, the traditional standing-prayer. When the worshipper has climbed to the top of the ladder of prayer, the scala contemplativa, and he is bound to and absorbed in the “source of the will,” all his petitions are fulfilled, since this source is the “world of mercy” (olam ra h amim) 225 that has no opposing force of judgment, the coinci- dentia oppositorum wherein all demerits are rendered meritorious, all guilt trans- muted into innocence. 226 In this place of conjunction—a place tellingly desig- nated in one zoharic passage as “the place that is no place” 227 — there is perfect harmony, indeed convergence, of the human and divine wills. Moreover, in this place that is no place, the space of pure mercy, there is no opposite, nothing contrary. Here one can ascertain the temporal pulse of divine creativity, identified as fortune (mazzla) , which the rabbis contrasted with merit (zekhuta) , that is, the superfluity of grace that overflows every computable mea- sure of justice, every demarcated boundary of law. One who is conjoined to this spot is able “to renew new miracles and wonders [le h addesh otot u-moftim h addashim] as if in that very hour [sha‘ah] the world were created.” By considering this for- mulation of David ben Yehudah one may discern the secret of creation that is enshrined within the confines of fate. How, then, does one renew that which is new? Prima facie, this charge seems to be contradictory: if something is to be renewed, it cannot be new, and if new, it cannot be renewed. Yet the language of renewing what is new expresses well the paradoxical (non)identification of change and permanence, novelty and repetition, characteristic of time. The one conjoined to the infinite through prayer comprehends time as the momentous and momentary renewal of what has always never been, an understanding that entails the ability to act miraculously, wondrously, in a manner unbound to causal sequence, recreating, as it were, the moment when the world was brought into being from nothing.

The verse “But there shall be a continuous day [ yom e h ad] — it will be known to the Lord—not day nor night, and at the time of evening shall be light” (Zech 14:7) is applied exegetically to Arikh Anpin, or Atiqa Qaddisha, the highest manifestation of the divine, also referred to in that context as Atiq Yomin, the Ancient of Days, a title derived from the vision of the enthroned deity in Daniel 7:9: In the time [zimna] that Atiq Yomin is aroused in the supernal arrayments, that one [ ha-hu] is called the “continuous day” [ yom e h ad] , for in the future his beard will be glorified [de-veih zamin le’oqir diqneih] by means of it, as it is written, “But there shall be a continuous day [ yom e h ad] — it will be known to the Lord” [ yom e h ad hu yewwada la- yhwh] . “It” [ hu] alone, more than everything else, that which comprises all [ hu de- khalil kola] , that which is called by the name that is known [ hu itqerei vi-shema yedi‘a] . As it has been taught: In the place that there is day there is night, for there is no day without night, and because that time to come [zimna zeman] will be the glory of the beard [diqara de-diqna] , and it [ hu] alone will be found, it is not called either “day” or “night.” 228 An attentive reading of this passage yields important and fundamental insights into the kabbalistic conception of time. The first thing to note is that time is not set in diametric opposition to eternity; rather, one discovers two tiers of tem- porality that correspond respectively to two formations of the divine: Arikh Anpin (or Atiq Yomin ), which is in the position of Keter, and Ze‘eir Anpin, which comprises the sefirot from H okhmah to Yesod. 229 Insofar as opposites coalesce in Arikh Anpin, the world wherein judgment is contained fully in mercy, the feminine in the mas- culine, an idea mythopoeically conveyed by the symbolic image of the single eye situated in the middle of the forehead, 230 it is appropriately designated the “continuous day,” yom e h ad, that is, the interval of time beyond the polarity of night and day, a temporal span that is continuously diurnal—all shadows of dark dissolved in the shimmer of light. By contrast, the lower form, Ze‘eir Anpin, contains judgment and mercy as distinct attributes, and thus it is characterized by the sequence of night and day. What is critical to emphasize is that even though there is neither day nor night in Arikh Anpin, the event of its arousal is designated by the temporal term zimna, which I have rendered “moment” to capture the sense of spontaneous diremption or recurrent irruption, that is, the summoning of what-will-be in the expectation of what-has-been the summon- ing of what-will-be, zimna zeman, the moment to be, momentous, momentary. 231 H aver, in accord with the symbolic language of Luria, positions Adam Qadmon, the “primordial human,” above the world of emanation, which is divided into Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 96"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics five configurations (par s ufim) : Arikh Anpin, Abba, Imma, Ze‘eir Anpin, and Nuqba.

However, Atiqa Qaddisha is above the category of boundary, measure, and time. Therefore, there is no aspect of vessel or measure there at all; rather, they are eternal [lefi ha-ni sh iyyut] . Yet, it is impossible to reach the quality of limitless perfection and the matter of eternality, which is the reward for the souls, except by means of voli- tion [be h irah] and temporal governance [ hanhagat ha-zeman] . Consequently, the root for vessels [shoresh la-kelim] is there, but they are not disclosed, only potentialities [ hakhanot] . 232 On the one hand, Adam Qadmon is beyond space and time, and hence it is inap- propriate to ascribe a “vessel” to it. In the world of emanation, by contrast, where space and time prevail, we can speak of the duality of container and con- tained. On the other hand, since there is no way to reach the imaginal plenum of the boundless and timeless except through the emanations, which exhibit boundary and temporality, it is possible, indeed necessary, to speak of the potentiality for a vessel in Adam Qadmon. If this were not the case, there would be deficiency in the infinite; but since the infinite comprises everything, it cannot be deficient in any manner, it cannot lack anything—not even lack, the poten- tial to receive, rendered metaphorically by the image of the vessel. In the root (shoresh) , the universal (kelal) , which contains the vessel (keli) , is the perfect unity beyond time (le-ma‘alah min ha-zeman) , the interminable temporal deportment (hanhagat ha-zeman le-ni sh iyyut) whence there is a transition to the flow of revealed time (ha-zeman ha-galuy) . Significantly, the three stages of time, symbolized by the three books through which the world was created according to the opening sec- tion of Sefer Ye s irah, 233 the three occurrences of YHWH in the priestly blessing (Num 6:24–26), and the three parts of the masoretic division of the scriptural canon, derive from the place of unity above time.

In This Moment: Engendering Time and Feminine Indeterminacy Time marks the pulsation of absence coming into presence as the nameless revealed in the veil of the ineffable name. 234 In the circumspection of this cir- cumscription, each moment appears unique, singular, wholly other in relation to what comes before and what comes after—no past, no future, no present. This secret is alluded to in the divine name proclaimed to Moses, “I will be as I will be,” ehyeh asher ehyeh, a name that names no-thing we can know since this name denotes that what it is to be for this divinity is to become what it will be in having been what it is to become, every manifestation a congruence of the infinite simplicity of simple infinity, the “metasemantic matrix” 235 that com- prises the predictably unpredictable possibility of each moment, the persistent presence of the unprecedented present that makes possible awaiting the past in recollecting the future. 236 In its character as enduring flux, it would seem that time should be gendered as masculine, the élan vital, which, when formulated within a phallocentric frame of reference, will be linked ontically to the fecundity of the membrum virile. There are surely kabbalistic texts that support this interpretative stance: time as pulsat- ing forward and resurging backward— or yashar and or h ozer, extending light and returning light, in Cordoverian terminology—is troped in phallic symbolism, whereas space as the curbed receptacle, emptiness gauged by the degree of its vacuity, is gendered as feminine, the capacity to receive that gives structure through imposing limit on the power to overflow. Insofar as time is the divine impulse, which is marked by the dialectic of contracting and extending, it stands to reason that it will exhibit both male and female characteristics, and that these will correspond respectively to light and darkness, day and night. Yet, as suggested by the image in one bahiric passage—the precious pearl that is at once the inseminating seed and the inseminated womb that gives birth 237 — the nocturnal and diurnal aspects are both localized in what I have called the “androgynous phallus” in an effort to indicate that, according to the traditional kabbalistic construction of gender, masculinity and femininity are ontologi- cally located in the attribute that assumes the function and role of the divine phallus. 238 To elucidate the point, I focus on a zoharic homily that deals with the mys- terious demise of the two sons of Aaron “when they drew near before the Lord” (Lev 16:1). Following a long exegetical trajectory, the zoharic authors Chapter Two 98 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 98"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"seek to comprehend why Aaron’s sons, Nadab and Abihu, suffered such a fate. To uncover the notion of time expressed in the homily one must attend more carefully to the biblical verse interpreted by the anonymous kabbalist, “And the Lord said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother and do not come at any moment to the shrine,” we-al yavo be-khol et el ha-qodesh (Lev 16:2). From this pro- hibition one may assume, though it is not stated explicitly, that the entry of Nadab and Abihu into the sanctuary was ill timed. At an earlier point in the nar- rative the reader is told that Aaron’s sons offered a “strange fire” (esh zarah) before the Lord (Lev 10:1; see also Num 3:4, 26:61), but we still do not know how this relates to the question of what constitutes the “wrong” or “right” moment. 239 Through the voice of R. Abba, a member of the fraternity clustered around Rashbi, the zoharic homilist begins the discourse by eliciting the fol- lowing moral from the biblical narrative: it is suitable to ask one’s requests dur- ing propitious times, when divine beneficence is found in the world, and not at times when severe judgment reigns. 240 To pray effectively one must be attuned to the different time zones, as it were, which reflect disparate states within the divine mirrored in the providential forces that govern the world, primarily the alternating periods of judgment and mercy, which correspond respectively to the altering templates of night and day. The author of the zoharic passage, through the mouthpiece of Rashbi, draws the obvious conclusion: We have established the matter in interpreting “[to give them food] in his moment” [latet okhlam be-itto] (Ps 104:27), and this is certainly so. Thus the holy One, blessed be he, came to warn Aaron not to err in the transgression with respect to which his sons erred, for this moment [ hai et] is known. Therefore, they should not err by joining the other moment [et a h ra] to the king, as it is written, “do not come at any moment [ be-khol et] to the shrine,” that is, even though he sees that it is the time that the other hand has been given power to rule in the world and it has been given to him to unite with it and to draw it close to the holy, for “I and my name are one” [ana u-shemi h ad hu] . Therefore “do not come at any moment to the shrine.” If you want to know by means of what he should enter —”through this” [ be-zo’t] . “Through this Aaron shall enter into the shrine” [ be-zo’t yavo aharon el ha-qodesh] (Lev 16:3), this zo’t is the moment [et] that is attached to my name, through this yod, which is inscribed in my name, you will enter the shrine. It has been taught: R. Yose said, it is written, “He has made everything beautiful in its moment” [et ha-kol asah yafeh ve-itto] (Eccles 3:11). This word was established by the holy flame [Simeon ben Yo h ai], and thus it is, as it has been taught, “He has made everything beautiful in his moment” [et ha-kol asah yafeh ve-itto] , and thus it is verily [wadda’y] . “Everything” [et ha-kol] — verily [wadda’y] . “He made it beautiful in his moment” [asah yafeh ve-itto] , one in the other, so that the others will not be mixed in with them. “In his time” [ve-itto] , precisely [mammash] , and not in another.

But what did the sons of Aaron do wrong? The author of this homily assumes that their transgression consisted of trying “to join the other moment to the king.” To comprehend the import of the expression “other moment,” et a h ra, it is necessary to mull over the mean- ing of the word et. 243 Rashbi established the intent of this term when interpret- ing the expression be-itto in the verse latet okhlam be-itto, “to give them food in his time” (Ps 104:27): “This is the Matrona who is called the ‘time of the righteous one’ [itto de- s addiq] , and thus all await this moment.” 244 We may deduce, there- fore, that the word et is one of the indexical markers of Matrona, a commonly used designation of Shekhinah or Malkhut in zoharic derashot, the tenth of the sefirotic emanations, a point we encountered above in the exposition of a pas- sage in Karo’s mystical diary. This is the intent as well of the expression “moment of the righteous one,” itto de- s addiq, that is, the moment, engendered as feminine, belongs to the s addiq, the righteous one, a standard reference in kab- balistic lore to the ninth emanation, Yesod, the phallic potency of the divine. 245 The “moment of the righteous one” symbolizes the union of Shekhinah and Yesod, an incorporation that portends the messianic redemption, which seems to me to be the underlying intent of the comment at the conclusion of Rashbi’s words, “all await this moment,” kullehu me h akan lehay itto. With this symbolism in hand we can decode the rest of the homily. If the word et denotes Shekhinah, then et a h ra, the “other moment,” will refer to the cor- responding force on the “other side,” sitra a h ra, the technical name of the demonic realm coined by Castilian kabbalists of the zoharic circle. The sin of Nadab and Abihu consisted of their attempt to unite the demonic feminine, elsewhere identified as Lilith, with the king on the side of holiness, which in this case is Tif’eret. Although not stated explicitly, it is likely that the zoharic interpretation was inspired by the expression esh zarah, “strange fire,” used in conjunction with Nadab and Abihu in several verses, as noted above. The “strange fire” they offered before the Lord, rendered symbolically, denotes Chapter Two 100 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 100"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"their desire to mix the unholy and holy—a reading attested in other zoharic passages. For example, the following appears in the stratum of Zohar known as Sitrei Torah: There is a holy fire [esha qaddisha] , the feminine [nuqba] , and a foreign fire [esha nukhra’ah] , the “strange fire” [esh zarah] , and thus it is written “do not come at any moment to the shrine” (Lev 16:2), this is the feminine from the evil inclination [nuqveta min ye s er ha-ra] . The holy spirit [rua h qaddisha] is male [dekhar] , and there is a spirit of impurity [rua h mesa’ava] , which is the evil inclination [ye s er ha-ra] , as it says, “From the stock of the serpent sprouts an asp” (Isa 14:29). There is holy ground [afar qaddisha] and unholy ground [afar mesa’ava] . 246 As still other zoharic comments demonstrate, the symbolic ascription of the strange fire to the feminine aspect of the demonic is enhanced by the exegeti- cal link made to the expression the “estranged woman,” ishshah zarah. “It is writ- ten ‘they offered a strange fire before the Lord’ (Lev 10:1); it is written here ‘strange fire’ and it is written there ‘to guard you from the estranged woman’ (Prov 7:5), and it is all one matter.” 247 In the symbolic imaginary of the zoharic kabbalists, the expression from Proverbs ishshah zarah alludes more specifically to the Christian woman, for Christianity, the prototypical idolatrous religion (the faith and piety of sitra a h ra ), is associated with sensual lust, the power of eros from the left, which parallels the power of eros from the right, manifest most ideally in the yearning to cleave to the divine through contemplative prayer and study. Indeed, as I have analyzed at length in an earlier study, there is a homol- ogy between the lure of Christianity as idolatry in the theological plane and as the crux of sexual seduction in the social sphere. 248 Moreover, as Yitzhak Baer observed long ago, zoharic homilies well attest that for kabbalists in northern Spain in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, one of the greatest challenges for the male Jew was not to succumb to the attraction of Christianity in either domain. 249 Nadab and Abihu are exemplary of biblical figures—with a pedi- gree no less impressive than being in the lineage of the high priest—who were not able to overcome the sexual temptation of the other side. It is likely, then, that the meaning of their offering a “strange fire” was that they cohabited with gentile women. 250 The point is drawn explicitly in the following passage. R. Judah began to expound, and he said: “It is the moment to do for the Lord, for they have broken your Torah” (Ps 119:126). “It is the moment to do for the Lord” [et la‘asot la-yhwh] .

It is, as it is said, “to guard you from the estranged woman” (Prov 7:5), and this is [alluded to in the words] “they offered a strange fire before the Lord” (Lev 10:1). What is the reason for et? For there is a moment [et] and time [zeman] for everything, to come close, to be illumined, to be united, as is appropriate, as it is said, “But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord, at a propitious moment” [wa-ani tefillati lekha yhwh et ra s on] (Ps 69:14). 251 As one might expect from a medieval Jewish mystical text, the mixing of unholy and holy has dire consequences. In line with the scriptural maxim of justice as measure-for-measure, the sons of Aaron were consumed by the holy fire, Shekhinah, the medium that executes divine judgment, for, symbolically, having intercourse with an estranged woman is on a par with offering a strange fire on the altar. Yet one may also discern between the lines of the zoharic text recognition of the spiritual proximity and kinship between idolatry and wor- ship, sexual temptation and erotic piety. The one who is captivated by the ecstatic fervor of the epiphanic moment will recognize that moment’s duplici- tous nature, holding forth both the possibility that one will succumb to the temptation of et a h ra to combine what should be kept separate and the possibil- ity that one will seize the moment of et ra s on to worship the divine with no admixture of evil. One might say, accordingly, that the moment of ecstasy, et la‘asot la-yhwh, is a two-edged sword, h erev pifiyyot (Ps 149:6), not only in the sense that the instant breaks into time in such a manner that it is severed from “before” and “after,” as discussed above, but also in the sense that it has the potential to sever one’s connection to the path. I am here reminded of the following description of the moment, al-waqt, in the eleventh-century treatise on the basic principles of Sufism composed by al- Qushayr i : They say: “The moment is a sword,” that is, just as the sword is cutting, so the moment prevails in what the real brings to pass and completes. It is said: “The sword is gentle to the touch, but its edge cuts. Whoever handles it gently is un- harmed. Whoever treats it roughly is cut.” Similarly for the moment, whoever submits to its decree is saved, and whoever opposes it is thrown over and destroyed. In this regard they composed the following verse: Like a sword — if you handle it gently its touch is gentle, but its edges, if you treat it roughly are rough. When the moment favors someone, the moment for him is just a moment. When the moment opposes someone, the moment for him is loathing. 252 Chapter Two 102 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 102"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Let me state emphatically that there are important and irreducible differences between the kabbalistic and Sufi views on the nature of the moment and its visionary propensities. Nonetheless, both discern an implicit danger in encoun- tering the truly real that is always in and of the moment. As the twelfth-century Persian visionary Suhraward i , the shaykh al-ishr a q, “master of illumination,” put it, flashes of light come forth from the divine presence “like a sudden lightning- bolt that comes unexpectedly and swiftly departs.” These “flashes” are called “times,” for time in its elemental form displays the quality of incisiveness, erupting like a knife that cuts the fabric of its sheath. “It is for this reason,” con- tinues Suhraward i , “that one says ‘Time is sharper than a sword.’ It is also said, ‘Time is a cutting sword.’ ” 253 Commenting on the same dictum several cen- turies before Suhraward i , al-Hujw i r i , the author of what is considered the old- est Persian treatise on Sufism, Kashf al-Mahj u b, wrote, “The Shaykhs have said, ‘Time is a cutting sword,’ because it is characteristic of a sword to cut, and ‘time’ cuts the root of the future and the past, and obliterates care of yesterday and to-morrow from the heart.” 254 The aspect of time that merits being com- pared to a sword is the moment (waqt) , for the one who lives fully in the pres- ent is cut off from the burden of recollecting the past and anticipating the future. The ordinary time-line, we might say, is undercut by the time of the moment, eternally renewed as what has eternally never been. In kabbalistic gnosis as well, the moment, which is the feminine, is a two- edged sword, the temporal interval that opens and closes, binds and unbinds. 255 This duplicity is captured in the zoharic comment on the scriptural expression h erev ha-mithappekhet, “ever-turning sword” (Gen 3:24), which is applied to Shekhinah: “It changes from this side to that side, from good to evil, from mercy to judgment, from peace to war, it changes in everything, good and evil, as it is written, ‘the tree of knowledge of good and evil’ (ibid., 2:17).” 256 The alter- nation between good and evil attributed to the divine presence portends the incisive quality of time, the fullness of the moment realized in the cut that binds, the fork in the road that splits into a path to the right and a path to the left. The sojourner on the way knows, however, that the two paths are not to be construed dichotomously, as they spring forth from one and the same font. I suggest that this insight underlies the statement from the zoharic homily with which we began: “even though he sees that it is the time that the other hand has been given power to rule in the world and it has been given to him to unite with it and to draw it close to the holy.” The remark is offered as the rationale for the restriction imposed on the priests not to enter “at any moment into the shrine,” for when contemplating entry into the shrine the priest appre- hends that even the demonic is not absolutely other in relation to the divine. The experience of God’s oneness discounts the possibility of ontological dual- Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 103 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 103"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"ism— an idea expressed by kabbalists, as well as by mystics in other traditions, in the image of the coincidence, and in some cases identity, of opposites. Hence the high priest is tempted to draw the strange fire into the shrine, to traverse the boundary and thereby unite demonic and divine, to a‹rm, in the zoharic lan- guage, God’s declaration, ana we-shem h ad hu, “I and the name are one.” Although the monistic claim is metaphysically true, in the unredeemed world, the man- date for the pious Jew is to keep pure and impure separate. When confronting the sacred in the form of the erotic energy of the feminine, the priest must resist the enticement to render the disjuncture of the moment — the slashing of the instant — conjunctive by blurring the boundaries separating holy and unholy. Phallic Fecundity and the Spatio-Temporal Enshrining of Prayer There is one more layer of meaning to expose in the zoharic homily, one that will help us uncover the most recondite dimension of the ontology of time and the kabbalistic phenomenology of prayer. We have established that the moment, et, corresponds to Shekhinah, the feminine potency of the divine. The matter of gender construction, however, is more complex than meets the eye. Let us recall the following comment: If you want to know by means of what he should enter —”through this” [ be-zo’t] . “Through this Aaron shall enter into the shrine” [ be-zo’t yavo aharon el ha-qodesh] (Lev 16:3), this zo’t is the moment [et] that is attached to my name; through this yod, which is inscribed in my name, you will enter the shrine. The intent of this passage is to relate that the ascription of the temporal category et to the feminine is dependent on her receiving the seminal e›ux of divine energy from the supernal sefirot, which are fashioned imaginally as male. 257 The point is enunciated in the following comment by David ben Yehudah he- H asid: “This is [the import of ] ‘Your garments should be white in every moment’ (Eccles 9:8), verily ‘in every moment’ [ be-khol et] , and this is the secret of ‘do not come at any moment to the shrine’ (Lev 16:2), for all the lights of the supernal crown [keter elyon] illumine this moment [me’irim le - hai et] , as it says, ‘It is the moment to do for the Lord’ [et la‘asot la-yhwh] (Ps 119:126), a moment ‘for every time and a moment for every desire’ [la-kol zeman we-et le-khol hefe s ] (Eccles 3:1).” 258 The context for this remark is an exposition of the words “he does not remit all punishment,” we-naqqeh lo yenaqqeh (Exod 34:7), which appear in the biblical Chapter Two 104 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 104"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"verses whence rabbinic interpreters eisegetically derived the thirteen attributes of divine mercy. Building on previous rabbinic texts, the medieval kabbalist accorded theurgic power to these verses; their recitation by Israel induces God to bestow a “free gift” (matanat h innam) in the form of his forgiving all trans- gressions through the conduit of “the attribute of whiteness [middat ha-lavan] , which is the whiteness of the skull [loven shel ha-gulggolet] .” With this in mind we can better comprehend the interpretation of the verse “Your garments should be white in every moment” (Eccles 9:8): the nature of the moment can be fath- omed from Keter, the ancient one, coterminous with the infinite and yet renewed, albeit unremittingly, as that which has eternally been what is yet-to- become; inasmuch as the supernal emanation is depicted as the “attribute of whiteness” or as the “whiteness of the skull,” it is incumbent that an individ- ual’s garment be white in every moment. In the zoharic passage cited earlier, the gender transformation of this process is brought into sharper relief. Shekhinah assumes the posture of the moment (et) when she receives from and is thereby incorporated into the male. The trans- position is alluded to in the claim that the word zo’t, the feminine demonstra- tive pronoun, is the yod that is inscribed in the divine name. The reference obvi- ously is to the first letter of the Tetragrammaton, which is yod, more specifically in this context to the yod that is the letter/sign of circumcision; through that let- ter, Shekhinah is attached to the name. To appreciate the full import of this claim, it is necessary to recall that zoharic homilists, like other kabbalists of their time, linked Shekhinah, which is called a t arah, with the corona of the phallus, a t eret berit. As I have discussed this symbolism in several separate studies, I will not dwell on the point here, except to emphasize the particular relevance of this transposition to understanding the nexus of time and prayer. The et, which ini- tially was identified as the female aspect, the Matrona, in the end is assimilated into part of the male organ, the yod, which is also inscribed in the name. By what means does the priest enter the shrine? Through zo’t, which is the yod, the sign of circumcision. With this we reach the point of perfect symmetry in the homiletical rhetoric exhibited by the zoharic author: Nadab and Abihu cohab- ited with gentile women and thereby placed the sign of the covenant in an unworthy place. From this transgression the high priest learns that he can only go into the shrine through the potency of zo’t, the letter of the name inscripted on the flesh, the yod, the feminine dimension of the phallic potency, identified as a t eret berit. 259 Exposure of the corona facilitates access to the sacred space in the sacred moment at hand, be-zo’t yavo aharon el ha-qodesh, for the site of the covenan- tal incision is the ontic root of time in its alternating phases of night and day. In this manner, the erotic ecstasy of the instant, whose incisive cut tears the fabric of time, is properly restrained by restoring the female to the male in the form Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 105 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 105"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"of the sign of circumcision, zo’t reincorporated into zeh. The containment of the female in the male ensures that boundaries will not be traversed and that the distinction between holy and unholy will be preserved. When the potentially threatening force of the unruly, transgressive feminine is properly reined in, then crossing the threshold at the propitious moment—indeed, the moment is the threshold that one crosses, entering and departing not as sequential acts but as one contemporaneous gesture—facilitates the meeting-point of time and space, a concurrence that bespeaks the mystery of prayer, which serves as a par- adigm for human worship generally. In the words of Shalom Dov Baer Schneersohn, “The worship of man is to join time and space and to unify them in divinity” (le h abber zeman u-maqom u-leya h adam ba-elohut) . 260 This association of the feminine and the phallic corona accounts for the essential link between time and memory a‹rmed repeatedly by kabbalists, the masculine (zakhrut) branded as the locus of memory (zikkaron) . 261 The generative force is envisioned, moreover, as the twenty-two Hebrew letters, which are contained within the name YHWH. These letters, in turn, allude to the ten sefirot, the luminous emanations arrayed in various images in the visionary’s imagination, especially the image of an anthropos. Philosophically speaking, envisioning the infinite entails the paradox of delineating the limit immeasura- ble in its delineation, enunciating the word unspoken in its enunciation, recol- lecting the trace forgotten in its recollection. This insight, which characterizes the kabbalistic orientation from early on, is well captured by Immanuel H ai Ricchi, the eighteenth-century Italian kabbalist and poet. Following earlier Lurianic sources, Ricchi asserts that the letters emerge in the space that comes to be as a consequence of s im s um, the contraction of the divine essence, which he refers to by the technical term “first cause” (sibbah ri’shonah) . The act of with- drawal is related to the “secret of judgment, the weakening of this place like a female when his cause goes out from him, and he separates the place of with- drawal [meqom ha- s im s um] so that it will be filled afterward with the mercy of the extension of the line [ hitpash t ut ha-qav] that will expand in it.” 262 The paradox of the letters materializing in the “place of withdrawal” engenders another para- dox (or perhaps more accurately, another aspect of the same paradox): the infinite is absent from the very absence from which it is absent, a threefold absence that alone can (re)present the (non)presence beyond representation. Ricchi articulates the matter with specific reference to the relationship between God and the most sacred of divine names: Thus we have proven that the force of the first cause is in the letters of the Torah, for they were the first generated being [ yesh ha-me h udash ha-ri’shon] that came to be in all the created beings, which were created by means of them.

From the abundance of his concealment he did not reveal the name of his essence in any matter from the matters of the Torah and not in any name from the holy names, for even the holiest of names is created. His first cause shines its light in it more than in the other names. Therefore, it is superior to all of them, for it is called by his name all the time that he illumines it. Thus, when the force of his cause is removed from it, even this name is removed. 263 Ein-Sof conceals the limitless force in the delimited letters of the Torah whence all things were created. This concealment, as noted above, ensues from the paradoxical withdrawal of the infinite from itself, a withdrawal that creates the space within which the secret comes forth in the secretion of letters. The let- ters, therefore, can be construed collectively as the veil that veils what is not to be (un)seen. Ricchi formulates the absence in radical terms (echoing earlier sources such as the fourteenth-century anonymous Ma‘arekhet ha-Elohut ) by stat- ing that no word or letter in the Torah scroll and none of the divine names refer to the substance of Ein Sof. 264 The distinctiveness of the Tetragrammaton, des- ignated alternatively as shem ha-meyu h ad, “unique name,” or shem ha-meforash, “explicit name,” is that the light of Ein-Sof shines in it more than in any other name, yet even with respect to this name the light shines therein only to the extent that it is occluded. In the place of withdrawal, the erasure is erased and the name inscripted. Time is precisely the measure of this “narrative space” arising from the infinite withdrawing into the sheltering-open of its hidden disclosure, 265 alef secreted in the opening of beit. From a kabbalistic vantage point we can speak of the over- coming of time but only in the timelessness of time’s perseverance as that which lingers in the lapsing of lingering and lapses in the lingering of lapsing. There is no eternity over and against time, but rather the timeless time of temporal eternity measured against the timelessness of eternal temporality, like the halo of silence enveloping the periphery of the verbal, the haze of invisibility per- meating the showground of the visible. 266 Day That Is Entirely Long: Temporal In-Difference I conclude this chapter with a brief excursus of a rather lengthy discourse on the kabbalistic meaning of time and eternity penned by Dov Baer Schneersohn, the second master of the Habad dynasty, as his explication pulls together many of 107 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 107"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"the themes examined here. The critical comment is in Dov Baer’s interpretation of the rabbinic motto, “King David shall live everlastingly” (dawid melekh yisra’el h ai we-qayyam) : 267 “This is the elevation of Malkhut to the essence of the light of Ein Sof, Malkhut of Ein Sof prior to the contraction [ s im s um] .” 268 The messianic proclamation of David’s everlasting existence is interpreted theosophically as the ascent of Malkhut to Ein Sof, a return to the state of affairs prior to the inceptual act of withdrawal that eventuated in the male androgyne being split into dis- crete masculine and feminine potencies. In the boundlessness of Ein Sof, there is no autonomous female that stands over and against the male; on the contrary, the potentiality for femininity is contained fully in the male; to be even more specific, it is located ontically in the corona of the phallus (a t eret berit) , 269 not the phallus of the genital area but the phallic potency situated in the head, some- times identified as the yod in the brain that corresponds to the yod inscribed on the circumcised phallus. 270 Thus far there is nothing exceptional about Dov Baer’s teaching. The innovative element surfaces in his explication of this motif in terms of time and eternity. The aforementioned eschatological teaching is part of a lengthy account of Judaism’s monotheistic declaration, shema yisra’el yhwh elohenu yhwh e h ad, “Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one” (Deut 6:4), and the utterance that immediately follows it, barukh shem kevod malkhuto le‘olam wa‘ed, “Blessed be the name of the glory of his kingdom forever.” The former corresponds to the supernal unity and the latter to the lower unity. That the compresence of the three modes of temporal eternality within YHWH—what was, what is, and what shall be (hayah howeh we-yihyeh) — parallels the compresence of three tenses of eternal temporality within Malkhut — past, present, and future (avar howeh we- attid) may be deduced from Dov Baer’s analysis: The root of the becoming of time [shoresh hithawwut ha-zeman] is in the aspect of Malkhut, which is specifically the aspect of the feminine [nuqba] , and this is the matter [of the rabbinic principle] that women are exempt from time-dependent positive commandments for time is in the feminine, 271 but the name YHWH, that is, what was, what is, and what will be as one [ hayah howeh we-yihyeh ke-e h ad] is above the aspect of past, present [and future] time . . . for the essence of the light of Ein Sof, which is entirely above time [a s mut or ein sof she-lema‘alah min ha-zeman legamrei] , shines through the aspect of time of the feminine [ ya’ir bi-ve h inat ha-zeman de-nuqba] ... and, consequently, the aspect of time will also be without limit [ biltti mugbal] and it will be eternal without cessation [ni sh i beli yufsaq] , and this is [the intent of the expression at the end of the liturgical formula barukh shem kevod malkhuto ] “forever” [le‘olam wa‘ed] , in the eternality [ni sh iyyut] of Ein Sof, for it is itself verily the aspect and gradation above time, but it is garbed in time. And this is [the meaning of the rabbinic slogan] “King David shall live everlastingly” [dawid melekh yisra’el h ai we-qayyam] , Chapter Two 108 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 108"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"eternally [le‘olam] . And this is specifically in the future to come, as is known, as it is written in Daniel, “The Ancient of Days [atiq yomin] was sitting” (Dan 7:9) and then “his kingdom will be an eternal kingdom [malkhuteih malkhut olam] (ibid., 27). And this [is the intent of the claim that] barukh shem kevod malkhuto le‘olam wa‘ed is above the YHWH of the supernal unity [shema yisra’el yhwh elohenu yhwh e h ad] , for the name YHWH comprises past, present, and future as one, but even so it is not in the aspect of that which is entirely above time; on the contrary, it is the source of time. How- ever, when time is without bound, as described above, that which is entirely above time, the essence of the light of Ein Sof, illumines it as it was before the withdrawal [ s im s um] ... and this is in the seventh millennium, which is called the “day that is entirely long” 272 [ yom she-kullo arokh] . 273 Three levels are distinguished in this passage: the root of the becoming of time in its triadic emplacement—past (avar) , present (howeh) , and future (attid) — ontically linked to the aspect of Malkhut, the last of the ten sefirot; the compresence of the three temporal modalities—what was (hayah) , what is (howeh) , and what will be (yihyeh) — as one unity, which is associated with YHWH, the ineffable name that symbolizes the rest of the sefirotic gradations; and, finally, the light of Ein Sof that is utterly beyond time. In the infinite, “the two parts, past and present, are equal, and there is no before with respect to the past nor after with respect to the future, but the two of them are as one in the Nothing, and the antecedent is consequent and the consequent antecedent, as it is devoid of the aspect of time.” 274 Dov Baer’s position is rendered more clearly in the follow- ing comment by his father and mentor, Shneur Zalman of Liady, which is based on the comment of Vi t al cited previously in this chapter: Thus, in truth, “For I, the Lord, have not changed” (Mal 3:6), for there is no alter- ation in God, blessed be he, from before the world was created when he and his name were alone 275 ... (and, similarly, prior to the coming-to-be of the aspect of time, for time similarly was created and generated anew, but there was an order of time [seder zemannim] prior to the creation of this world, that is, from the moment of the emanation and coming-to-be of the spiritual worlds [et a s ilut we-hithawwut olamot ha-ru h aniyyim] ... but prior to this no order of time was appropriate [qodem lazeh lo hayah shayyakh shum seder zemannim] , for he, blessed be he, is entirely beyond time [lema‘alah me-ha-zeman legamrei] ), and so it will be after the world is destroyed, and also now in the time of the creation and subsistence of the world, before him everything is verily considered to be nothing [kulla mammash ke-lo h ashiv] 276 just as it was before the world was created . . . but with respect to us the world is considered as something and as a thing unto itself, and it hides the divinity and hence is called “world” [olam] on account of “the concealment” [ ha-he‘elem] , for it conceals the divinity and hides it. 277 Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 109 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 109"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"One can speak properly of the coming-into-being of time with the emanation of the sefirot, a temporal unfolding/enfolding of spiritual entities that cannot be situated in corporeal space, a process encoded semiotically in the Tetragramma- ton, which conveys the compresence of what was, what is, and what shall be. 278 The attribution of time to the divine is related more specifically in Habad philosophy, including the passage of Dov Baer just cited, to the quality of gov- ernance, and therefore it is ascribed to Malkhut, the last of the sefirotic emana- tions, the point of liminality situated between the world of unity and the world of multiplicity. Given the centrality of this notion in the Habad understanding of time, it is not be extraneous or digressive to cite another comment of Shneur Zalman of Liady: And this is [the import of ] “Your kingship is an eternal kingship and your domin- ion is for all generations” [malkhutekha malkhut kol olamim u-memshalttekha be-khol dor wa- dor] (Ps 145:13), “eternal” [olamim] refers to the aspect of place [maqom] and “for all generations” the aspect of time [zeman] . Everything issues forth from the aspect of “your kingship” [malkhutekha] , for time and place are created and come to be from nothing to something [me-ayin le-yesh] . Prior to the creation of the world there was no aspect of time or space at all, and there could be no created entities delimited in the aspect of time and place except by means of the aspect of his kingship [malkhuto] , blessed be he, to which the aspect of time belongs, “he reigned [malakh] , he reigns [melekh] , and he will reign [ yimlokh] ,” 279 which is not the case in the light of Ein Sof, blessed be he, for he is as his name, and he has no limit. 280 The identification of Malkhut as the ontic source of time is supported by the liturgical formula that a‹rms God’s dominion in the past, present, and future, an idea repeated often in Habad literature. 281 Space and time cannot be applied to any of the divine attributes except for Malkhut, for this is the attribute that most precisely conveys the sense of divine governance (adnut) . From this vantage point the inherent correlation of temporality and the feminine becomes evident. It must be noted, however, that some statements offered by the various Habad masters problematize this characterization to an extent by locating the root of time in the masculine potency that bestows the e›ux upon the feminine. Thus, for example, Dov Baer writes: “Evening and morning is the time of night and day whose root is in Ze‘eir Anpin, which is called the ‘source of the coming-to-be of time that is in Malkhut ’ [meqor hithawwut ha-zeman she-be-malkhut] , ‘[he ruled], he rules, and he will rule,’ as it has been explained in another place with regard to the explanation of the name YHWH, ‘he was, he is, [he will be]’, for it com- prises everything that is in the past, present, and future in the aspect of the time of Malkhut. ” 282 Chapter Two 110 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 110"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"This distinction is sometimes framed in terms of the rabbinic notion of seder zemannim, which is set in contrast to zeman proper, the former linked to Ze‘eir Anpin and the latter to Malkhut. 283 The matter is rendered even more complex by the fact that, according to Habad’s acosmic philosophy, 284 there is only one reality, the light of Ein Sof, but this light, which cannot be delimited either spatially or tem- porally, assumes the semblance of independent beings subject to physical laws of space and time. Shneur Zalman ardently insists, therefore, that in relation to the “substance” (mahut) and “essence” (e s em) of the infinite, the aspects of place and time “are verily nullified in existence [be t eilim bi-me s i’ut mammash] ... in the way that the light of the sun is nullified in the sun [ke-vi tt ul or ha-shemesh ba-shemesh] .” 285 When viewed through this prism, the cosmos (olam) is the concealment (he‘elem) that reveals the light that cannot be revealed but through concealment. 286 Mena h em Mendel, the successor to Dov Baer, deftly delineated this feature of Habad acosmism, reiterating almost verbatim the language of Shneur Zalman: The root of time comes to be only in the aspect of Malkhut, for the aspect of Malkhut has the aspect of “he reigned, he reigns, and he shall reign” [malakh melekh yimlokh] ... but above the aspect of Malkhut time does not apply at all [lema‘alah mi-be h inat malkhut ein shayyakh zeman kelal] . In the midrash it says that this teaches that there was an order of time [seder zemannim] before this.” 287 The intent is that [the locution] “before this” applies to this world, prior to this world’s generation, but prior to the emanation of the supernal worlds even the order of times was not at all suitable. Therefore it is not appropriate to ask why the creation of the world was not earlier since there was no time, and it does not apply at all either before or after, for before or after there only applies an aspect of time [be h inat zeman] . What emerges from this is that he and his name were alone prior to [the creation] and will be so after the world is destroyed as well, and there will be no time. Therefore, even now in the midst of time before him [everything] is considered as nothing, and everything that is closer to being before him is considered more as nothing, and only in relation to us it becomes concealment [ he‘elem] and occlusion [ hester] , and thus the [cosmos] is called olam from the word he‘elem. 288 Time is associated uniquely with Malkhut, the attribute of the divine to which governance in the world is assigned, but time should in fact be thought of as an illusion, since the world is not accorded independent ontic status. The playful etymology that links olam and he‘elem drives home the point that the world is a garment that reveals the light of the infinite (or ein sof) by concealing it, for had the light not been concealed, the world would have been extinguished in the infinite, just as the ray of sunlight is absorbed the orb of the sun. 289 Just it is meaningless to speak of time prior to creation when contemplating the divine, Linear Circularity / (A)Temporal Poetics 111 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 111"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"so it is pointless to speak of time when considering what will be after the world is destroyed.

The release from time is possible, how- ever, even in the middle, even in the course of one’s lifetime, when the empti- ness of being is contemplated from the standpoint of the infinite. Attaining this state of annihilation, turning yesh back to ayin, is the eschatological consciousness through which and in which time as the primordial pulse of creation is covertly revealed, openly concealed. According to the passage from Dov Baer cited above, the messianic moment, rhetorically expressed in the rabbinic slogan “King David shall live everlast- ingly” (dawid melekh yisra’el h ai we-qayyam) and in the liturgical formula “Blessed be the name of the glory of his kingdom forever” (barukh shem kevod malkhuto le‘olam wa‘ed) , is characterized as the elevation of Malkhut to Ein Sof, but also as the illu- mination of Malkhut by Ein Sof, two figurative ways of describing her restoration to the position she occupied within the boundless prior to the primal act of divine contraction. 290 Time is thereby transformed since it no longer has a limit—a philosophical idea communicated by the mythopoeic depiction of the seventh millenium as one elongated day, that is, the day beyond partition into the nocturnal/diurnal binary. As Dov Baer says in another context: In the escha- ton, both sun and moon will be limitless in their power, a balancing that neu- tralizes any priority or privilege accorded one over the other, but it is still pos- sible, indeed necessary, to speak of an attribute of day [middat yom] , albeit “a day that is entirely long, entirely good [ yom she-kullo arokh she-kullo t ov] ... above male and female, which are called sun and moon.” 291 In the state of redeemed time, the dyadic structure of night and day, marked by the dialectic of extension (hitpash t ut) and withdrawal (histalqut) , 292 gives way to the nondifferentiated unity in which opposites are no longer distinguishable as opposites. Consistent with what is a‹rmed in earlier kabbalistic sources, how- ever, the overcoming of the dimorphism does not imply difference of identity but rather identity of difference. The ultimate reality is described therefore as one elongated day that comprises both day and night rather than a span of time that is neither day nor night; identity of difference, as opposed to difference of iden- tity, entails the absorption of one antinomy in the other such that we can speak of night contained in day, dark in light, left in right, female in male. As a repre- sentative illustration of this point, consider this remark of the Vilna Gaon: Thus on the seventh day it does not say “And there was evening [and there was morning],” for there male and female are not disclosed, and there they are one and contained [one within the other], the female contained in the male, as is Chapter Two 112 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 112"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"known, in the secret of waw within the supernal he. And even the day [ ha-yom] is there in concealment, and this is [the import of ] what is written, “there shall be a continuous day [only known to the Lord] that is neither day nor night, and there shall be light at eventide” (Zech 14:7). This is the seventh day that is entirely Sabbath, as is known. 293 In a touch of historical irony, on this key doctrinal point (though surely not exclusively on this point) there is a basic agreement between the Lithuanian kabbalist and the view espoused by the Lubavitch masters. Focusing especially on the gender implications of this eschatological conception of time as the reconstitution of the male androgyne, the comment of Shneur Zalman on the verse “On that very day Abraham was circumcised,” be-e s em ha-yom ha-zeh nimmol avraham (Gen 17:26) is relevant: Abraham merited the disclosure of the aspect “the Lord will circumcise your heart” (Deut 30:6), and thus it is written “Abraham was circumcised” (Gen 17:26). And this is [the import of ] “On that very day [ be-e s em ha-yom ha-zeh] Abraham was circum- cised” (ibid.), that is, in the essence of that day [ be-a s miyyut shel ha-yom ha-zeh] , and that day is the day that is entirely long and entirely good [ ha-yom she-kullo arokh kullo t ov] . The essence of that day is the great disclosure that will occur in the future, the disclo- sure of the aspect of “the abundance of your goodness” (Ps 31:20, 145:7), and this [is the aspect of the day] that is entirely good, and when the aspect of the “essence of that very day” was revealed to him, Abraham was circumcised. 294 To do justice to this passage, one would have to examine in greater detail its fuller exegetical context, an eminently worthy task but one that lies beyond the concerns of this chapter. Su‹ce it to note, however, that the circumcision of Abraham, which is emblematic of the eschatological moment, is identified as the “second circumcision” (milah sheniyyah) , an act performed from above to below, the “arousal from above” (itaruta di-le‘eila) , in contrast to the “first cir- cumcision” (milah ri’shonah) , the halakhic rite, which is performed from below to above, the “arousal from below” (itaruta di-letata) . The latter is focused on the rit- ual act of circumcising the flesh, whereas the former is expressive of the cir- cumcision of the heart, a spiritual state described as higher than Torah. Thus concerning this second circumcision, which is after the ingathering of the exiles and after the fulfillment of the entire Torah, it is written, “Who among us can go up to the heavens” [mi ya‘aleh lanu ha-shamaymah] (Deut 30:12), the first letters [spell] milah, and it is above the aspect of Torah, for with respect to the Torah it says “it is not in heaven” (ibid.), as it is humbled below. . . .

Regarding this the rabbis, blessed be their memory, said, “Great is circumcision [gedolah milah] for thirteen covenants were decreed on the basis of it.” 296 The [words] “great is circumcision” [gedolah milah] portend the aspect of the “great circumcision” [ ha-milah ha-gedolah] from above to below, [signified by the verse] “the Lord will circumcise your heart” (Deut 30:6). . . . The disclosure and overflow of the aspect of the great circumcision come about by means of the thirteen attributes of mercy, which are above wisdom and intellect. Therefore it is above the aspect of the name YHWH and above the aspect of Torah (just as the thirteen attributes of mercy are the aspect that is above the Torah and hence forgiveness of transgression is found there). . . . Through this one can understand the matter of Abraham having fulfilled the entire Torah before it was given, but he did not fulfill the commandment of circumcision, as he wanted to attain that great circumcision from above to below. Therefore, he fulfilled all of the Torah that is below that circumcision and afterwards he merited that great circumcision that is above. 297 The circumcision of Abraham’s membrum virile resulted from his having mer- ited the circumcision of the heart, a spontaneous gesture that issues from the highest manifestation in the sefirotic pleroma, Arikh Anpin, a term derived from the scriptural elocution erekh appayim in Exodus 34:6, 298 the place that is pure mercy and consequently beyond the strictures of law and its implied system of reward and punishment. 299 Needless to say, the position articulated by Shneur Zalman should not be confused with the Pauline argument so influential in the history of Christianity that circumcision of the spirit (identified with the rite of baptism) replaces circumcision of the flesh. For Shneur Zalman, there is no sub- stitution or replacement; to locate the circumcision of the heart in a gradation superior to the law of dichotomy implies not an abrogation of that law but rather a deepening of it by adhering to its source in Keter, the realm of unmiti- gated mercy and unwarranted forgiveness—hence the identification of the thir- teen covenants mentioned in conjunction with circumcision and the thirteen attributes of mercy. The second circumcision, which foreshadows the eschatological moment, triggers the transmutation of the carnal body into the semiotic body, that is, the body composed of the twenty-two Hebrew letters, which are contained, in turn, in the Tetragrammaton, the mystical essence of Torah, configured as an anthropos in the imagination of the visionary. In brief, we can say that the eso- teric gnosis of kabbalah, which underlies the Hasidic teaching championed by Shneur Zalman, advocates the transubstantiation of the flesh into word—in Chapter Two 114 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 114"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"contrast to the Christological incarnational emphasis on the word becoming flesh. 300 The implication of body transposing into letter for the kabbalistic under- standing of time may be inferred from the scriptural statement that Abraham was circumcised “on that very day,” be-e s em ha-yom ha-zeh, which, read hyperlit- erally, is decoded as “in the essence of that day,” be-a s miyyut shel ha-yom ha-zeh. The import of circumcision illumines and is illumined by the essential nature of the day, which is conveyed by the eschatological images employed in rabbinic lit- erature: “the day that is entirely long,” yom she-kullo arokh, and “the day that is entirely good,” yom she-kullo t ov. Circumcision of the heart, which induces the spontaneous circumcision of the flesh—rather than its abnegation, as Paul and countless Christian thinkers who followed in his wake argued — draws our attention to the redemptive capacity of time, or, to be more specific, to the redemptive capacity of the moment in which time is redeemed by time. In this moment opposites coincide and difference is effaced in the identity of indiffer- ence, an ideal conveyed, as noted above, by the image of day without night, or alternatively, good without evil—rather than by the image of a time that is nei- ther day nor night or a state that is neither good nor evil. To experience the temporal overcoming of time one must be conjoined to Keter, the “aspect that is intermediate between that which is bounded in actual- ity and that which is boundless . . . the root of the coming-to-be of the order of time [shoresh hithawwut seder zemannim] ... which is intermediary between Ein Sof itself and the emanation,” the locus of the coincidentia oppositorum, which is called “Ancient of Days” (atiq yomin) , “for it is the eternality of the days [ni sh iyyut ha-yomin] .” 301 That the temporal overcoming of time, an over-coming that ensues from under-going, is the esoteric intent of Shneur Zalman’s escha- tological teaching may be adduced from another passage, where he sets out to explain why the Sinaitic epiphany took place in a “desolate desert” (midbar h areivah) : The matter is that the essence of engagement with Torah is to be in the aspect of complete annihilation in the light of the infinite, blessed be he [iqqar eseq ha-torah hu lihyot bi-ve h inat bi tt ul be-or ein sof barukh hu legamrei]. ...

Going beyond the monistic tendency evident in Maharal’s thought, Shneur Zalman and his successors emphasize that although the cosmos appears to be composed of independent entities, when the veil of epistemic ignorance is removed, it becomes clear that these entities have no independent ontic status as they are naught but aspects of the light of Ein Sof. Torah provides the means by which one is conjoined to the light of the infinite and so attains the state of annihilation, construed temporally as the day that is entirely long, the day that is entirely Sabbath, that is, the tem- poral span wherein night is contained within day. The most basic feature of time according to kabbalistic wisdom concerns the eternal recurrence of what is recurrently ephemeral, the self-same repetition of what is repeatedly different, the chronic coming-to-be of what has perpetually never-come-to-pass. Time weaves its web of luminal darkness, concealing truth disclosed in the disclosure of untruth concealed. The play of antinomies char- acterizes both the inscripted erasure and the decoding thereof by the kabbalist, who comprehends that eternity is the elongation of time’s rotating wheel, the curvilinear withholding of what is extended forward, instigated by the illumi- nation of Malkhut by Ein Sof and the consequent ascent of the former to the lat- ter. Again, to cite Dov Baer: The matter is as it is said “eternity” (1 Chron 29:11) — this is the construction of Jerusalem 304 ... for the construction of Jerusalem in the future will be eternal in time [ni sh i bi-zeman] without any cessation at all, for the aspect of the kingship of David and the Messiah in the future will also be eternal, as it is written, “That it may be firmly established . . . now and evermore” (Isa 9:6), as it said, “King David shall live everlastingly,” 305 as it is known concerning what is written, “He asked you for life” (Ps 21:5), in the aspect of the eternal life of Ein Sof verily [ h ayyim ni sh i de-ein sof mammash] , for he will be illumined from the aspect of Malkhut of Ein Sof itself, con- cerning which it is said “The Lord will reign forever” (Exod 15:19), verily in the aspect of the eternal world. Even though now the divine light in the aspect of Malkhut of emanation enters [the worlds of ] creation, formation, and doing in the limited temporality of past, present, and future, “he reigned,” “he reigns,” and “he will reign,” and these are “the six thousand years in which the world exists,” 306 for, as it is known, the essence of the boundary of time [de-iqqar ha-gevul di-zeman] is in Malkhut, but it is known that he will be illumined from the essence of the light of Ein Sof that is above space and time, precisely in the aspect of the time of Malkhut. Therefore, the aspect of the division of time will be eternal [ hit h alqut ha-zeman yihyeh ni sh i] without any cessation at all, for it is called “eternal life” [ h ayyei olam] . 307 Chapter Two 116 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 116"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Cosmic time, represented by the cycle of six thousand years, is subject to the threefold division of past, present, and future, but this time is transcended in the eschatological Sabbath, wherein time no longer reflects the triadic fragmenta- tion.

Celan, “Mit Brief und Uhr” 118 3 Before alef comes beit —h ere in a nutshell lies the wisdom of kabbalah. This par- abolic utterance finds expression in what is presumably an older mytholo- goumenon preserved in Sefer ha-Bahir, long considered one of the earliest sources that contains, albeit in rudimentary form, the panoply of theosophic symbols expounded by kabbalists through the generations. 1 A translation of the passage that has served as the basis for my reflections is fol- lowed by a philosophical analysis of its content that links the salient images to other statements in the bahiric anthology. The intent of this chapter is to shed light on the hermeneutical dilemma of the beginning: How does the beginning begin without having already begun? If, however, the beginning cannot begin without having already begun, in what sense is it a beginning? John Sallis succinctly expressed the logical impossibility of a‹rming a beginning: “To begin will always be (or prove to have been) redoubling—which is to say no beginning at all.” 2 The mythic saying of the Bahir, which may well tell us something originary about kab- balistic epistemology, relates in the first instance to this ontological problem: R. Re h umai sat and expounded: Why is alef at the head [ ba-ro’sh] ? For it 3 preceded everything, even Torah. And why is beit next to it? Because it was first [te h illah]. 4 And why does it have a tail? To show the place whence it came, and there are some who say that from there the world is sustained. Why is gimmel third? For it is third and to indicate that it bestows kindness [gomelet h esed]. 5 But did R. Aqiva not say: Why is gimmel t hird?

Why is there a tail at the bottom of gimmel? He said to them: The gimmel has a head on top and it resembles a pipe. Just as the pipe draws from what is above and discharges to what is below, so gimmel draws by way of the head and discharges by way of the tail, and that is gimmel. 6 Preserved in this text is what I presume to be an ancient mythic teaching according to which the divine powers are represented by the first three letters of the Hebrew alphabet. 7 Alef is the foundation, “at the head,” ba-ro’sh, 8 but not the beginning, te h illah, for the beginning is beit, which is second. And what of gimmel? It is third, exemplifying a threefold character—bestowing, growing, and sustaining. At last, we come to a letter that coincides with its numerical value, for alef is first but not the beginning, and beit is the beginning that is sec- ond. 9 Does the first not begin? How is the beginning not first? Useful in understanding the distinction between first and beginning, origin and inception, is a remark of Rosenzweig: “Regarding essence, one inquires about origin, but regarding action, about the beginning,” Beim Wesen fragt man nach der Ursprung, bei der Tat nach dem Anfang. 10 Rosenzweig, in great measure indebted to Schelling’s later philosophy, which he links notionally to the cosmological spec- ulation of Lurianic kabbalah, 11 distinguishes between “origin” and “beginning,” Ursprung and Anfang; the former relates to the void of the divine nature and the latter to the projection of the divine into the void of nature. “Origin” is an ontic demarcation, a name ascribed to the abyssal state that is the essence of God (des göttlichen Wesens) , the whither and whence of all that comes to be in the cycle of becoming; “beginning,” by contrast, is a chronological demarcation that marks the initiatory moment of the temporal enfolding of divine action (der göttlichen Tat) . Origin, accordingly, belongs to “the way of negation” (der Weg der Verneinung) , beginning to “the way of a‹rmation” (der Weg der Bejahung) . 12 It is helpful to interject the view of Heidegger, which not only illustrates an interesting a‹nity with Rosenzweig, but also exposes another element that strikes a resonant chord with kabbalistic teaching. Heidegger contrasted “begin- ning” (Beginn) and “origin” (Anfang) in an essay on the history of Western thought published in 1954: “The beginning is, rather, the veil that conceals the origin—indeed an unavoidable veil. If that is the situation, then oblivion shows itself in a different light. The origin keeps itself concealed in the beginning.” 13 It lies beyond the scope of this chapter to conduct a systematic investigation Before Alef / Where Beginnings End 119 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 119"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"of the terms Beginn and Anfang (to which one would also have to add Ursprung ) in Heidegger’s thought. 14 Su‹ce it for our purposes to focus on the difference between beginning, on one hand, and origin and inception, on the other, cast in terms of concealment, which invariably implies disclosure, not as polarities resolved in a dialectical identification but as opposites belonging together in their opposition. Let me acknowledge that I am extracting Heidegger’s termi- nology from its original context, which concerned the history of Western phi- losophy. 15 This is a legitimate move, however, since Heidegger himself plainly and repeatedly a‹rmed a parallelism between the history of being and the his- tory of thought 16 —a basic tenet of Western philosophy and science intimated in the dictum of Parmenides to gar auto noein estin te kai einai, “for the same thing can be thought as can be,” 17 and epitomized centuries later in the principle of Spinoza: Ordo et connexio idearum idem est, ac ordo et connexio rerum, “Order and connec- tion of ideas is the same as order and connection of things.” 18 Needless to say, the assonance between ordo idearum and ordo rerum on Heidegger’s path of poetic thinking is quite distinct from the parallel juxtaposition on the path of Spinoza’s metaphysical monism—indeed, one could credibly discount the need on the part of Heidegger to posit two orders rooted in the idealist/materialist distinc- tion still reverberating in Spinoza’s cosmological axiom—but the fact of their being analogous nonetheless remains constant. How, then, can we formulate the difference between beginning and origin? Beginning is the advent of something that begins at a discrete juncture in the past and will be brought to a conclusion at some time in the future. A pattern of causal sequentiality is presumed and grafted onto the aggregate of experi- ences believed to take shape on a horizontal plane of temporality. What occurs at the onset, however, becomes increasingly less significant as the temporal event unravels. As Heidegger put it in another context, “Being a beginning [Beginn] involves being left behind in the course of the process. The beginning is there just to be abandoned and passed over. The beginning is always sur- passed and left behind in the haste of going further.” 19 Origin, by contrast, is not an occurrence that commences and terminates at specific times and places; it is the ground “from which something arises or springs forth.” 20 It is the point of departure “from and by which something is what it is and as it is. What something is, as it is, we call its essence or nature. The origin [Ursprung] of something is the source of its nature.” 21 Essence and nature should not be understood in a static sense (logocentrically, one might say). On the contrary, origin comes to be in the course of an event, and it is thus fully clear only at the end of that which cannot begin. Heidegger’s notion of Ursprung is elucidated by Benjamin’s comments in the Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels regarding the “dialectic which is inherent in origin:” Chapter Three 120 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 120"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Origin [Ursprung] , although an entirely historical category, has, nevertheless, nothing to do with genesis [Entstehung] . The term origin is not intended to describe the process by which the existent came into being, but rather to describe that which emerges from the process of becoming and disappearance. . . . That which is origi- nal is never revealed in the named and manifest existence of the factual; its rhythm is apparent only to a dual insight. On the one hand, it needs to be recognized as a process of restoration and reestablishment, but, on the other hand, and precisely because of this, as something imperfect and incomplete. There takes place in every original phenomenon a determination of the form in which an idea will constantly confront the historical world, until it is revealed fulfilled, in the totality of its history. Origin is not, therefore, discovered by the examination of actual findings, but it is related to their history and their subsequent development. 22 In a similar gesture, reflecting on the Greek word arche — in which one should hear the resonance of origin (Ursprung) and incipience (Anfang) — Heidegger notes that it is “that from which something emerges, but that from which something emerges retains, in what emerges and its emerging, the determination of motion and the determination of that toward which emergence is such.” 23 The origin, therefore, “is a way-making [Bahnung] for the mode and compass of emergence. Way-making goes before and yet, as the incipient [Anfängliche] , remains behind by itself .... In this we perceive that from whence there is emergence is the same as that back toward which evasion returns.” 24 On the way there are per- spectives, but solely in the end is the indeterminacy determined, and only then can we speak of destiny, of having been sent forth in historical resoluteness to chart the circular extension of primordial temporality, that is, time in its origi- nary sense as the expectation of what is recollected in the recollection of what is expected. 25 Beginning and origin have diametrically opposite trajectories: beginning is what stands behind us, origin what stands before us. The origin invades the future by awaiting us in the past, advancing beyond all that is to come by returning to where it has been. 26 To see what lies ahead one must be mindful of what is at the head. Beginning is a veil that shrouds what has come before, and thus origin keeps itself concealed in the beginning. Surprisingly, I have found in the words of Heidegger a key to unlock the bahiric symbolism. Before proceeding to unpack this symbolism, let me briefly comment on using the views of a twentieth-century philosopher to explicate an esoteric theosophy crystallized in the Middle Ages. In spite of the blatant differ- ences between medieval kabbalists and Heidegger, too obvious to warrant delin- eation, applying the poetic thinking of the latter to the former is justifiable on two accounts. First, historical connections (especially through secondary channels of influence like Schelling) 27 between Heidegger and kabbalah cannot be ruled out Before Alef / Where Beginnings End 121 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 121"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"unequivocally. In the first chapter, I discussed briefly Schelling’s characterization of the abyss, the primordial being, as an identity of two independent and irre- ducible forces rendered equal in their opposition, the a‹rmative force of out- pouring and the negative force of withholding. I noted the probable influence of kabbalistic theosophy on Schelling through the German theosophy of a figure like Böhme, and I also suggested Heidegger’s indebtedness to the latter. The second rationale for turning to Heidegger to explicate medieval kabbal- istic symbolism is the significant conceptual a‹nities between the two ways of thinking. 28 Indeed, the path of Heidegger’s later thought turns in a paradoxical manner—predicated, as it is, on a poetological heeding of the unspoken in what is spoken — particularly appropriate for the study of kabbalah. 29 The charge of anachronism is dismissible, in my judgment, as the philological insis- tence that a text be studied in a historical context construed in an exclusively synchronic fashion, though surely valid up to a point, need not be accorded hegemony when it comes to the hermeneutical task of reconstructing meaning. I am certainly not advocating an interpretative model of academic study that dis- cards philological competence on the spurious grounds that all readings are equally valid; on the contrary, as even a cursory perusal of my work indicates, I embrace the discipline of philology as a legitimate means for reconstructing historical meaning and thereby situating a text in its proper literary context. Beyond this determination, however, the meaning one imparts or elicits from a text need not be constricted by chronological proximity. Moreover, as I have discussed in detail elsewhere, 30 one’s hermeneutical orientation cannot be dis- entangled from presumptions regarding human experience and especially con- cerning the complex role memory plays in identity formation. If one were to subscribe to the theoretical possibility of time reversibility, then one could not be certain that the future does not continue to flow into the past through the present, 31 and, if the past may be as much determined by the future as the future by the past, then it is perfectly reasonable to propose that a thinker like Heidegger could provide a meta-discourse to disclose structures of thought in kabbalistic literature. Lest there be any misunderstanding, however, let me also state emphatically that I am not proposing that Heidegger’s thinking should be privileged as the only viable or even the best hermeneutical method to approach kabbalistic texts in a contemporary critical idiom. To return to the symbolism of the Bahir, the beginning, we can say, is beit, while alef is the origin. Beit, accordingly, is a veil that conceals alef, but can what is hidden be veiled? 32 How does the (un)veiling of the veiled take place? Through the agency of the third, gimmel, the conduit that draws from alef and disseminates to beit. 33 For the moment, we must concentrate on origin and beginning, and thus return to alef and beit, laying gimmel aside temporarily.

That is why Torah begins not with alef but with beit, the beginning that is before the origin that pre- cedes it. 36 The beginning is second and hence points to that which comes before. Thus, we are told, the function of the scribal tail on the backside of the beit is “to show the place whence it came, and there are some that say that from there the world is sustained.” 37 The beit —a trace of what was before it was after 38 — reverts back to alef, the source that sustains the world through bestow- ing, a quality that is attributed to gimmel on account of its etymological link to gomel. 39 The secret open of alef is manifest in the open secret of gimmel. 40 To begin, then, we start with beit, the beginning that is second. Ironically, the first discourse about beit in the redacted form of Bahir begins somewhere in the middle of a conversation that has already begun, we know not when: And why does it 41 begin [mat h il] with beit? Just as [the word] berakhah begins. How do we know the Torah is called berakhah? As it says, “And the sea 42 is full of the Lord’s blessing” [u-male birkat yhwh yam] (Deut 33:23), and the [word] yam is nothing other than Torah, as it says, “and broader than the sea” [u-re h avah minni-yam] (Job 11:9). What is [the meaning of ] “full of the Lord’s blessing” [male birkat yhwh]? In every place, beit is blessing [ berakhah], 43 as it is said, “In the beginning” [ bere’shit], and the [word] “beginning” [re’shit] is nothing other than wisdom [ h okhmah], and wisdom is nothing other than blessing, as it is said, “And God blessed Solomon,” 44 “And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon” (1 Kings 5:26). To what may this be compared? To a king who married his daughter to his son, and he gave her to him as a gift, and said to him, “Do with her as you please!” What can we heed [mai mashma]? That berakhah is from the word berekh, as it says, “to me every knee shall bend” [ki li tikhra kol berekh] (Isa 45:23), the place to which every knee bows down. To what may this be compared? To ones who seek to see the face of the king but they do not know the whereabouts of the king. Initially, they ask about the house of the king [sho’alim beito shel melekh te h illah] , and afterward they ask about the king. Therefore, “to me every knee shall bend,” even the supernal ones, “every tongue shall pledge loyalty” (ibid.). 45 Torah begins with beit, for the first letter of the word for “blessing,” berakhah, is beit, and Torah is blessing, for blessing is associated with yam, the “sea,” and the Before Alef / Where Beginnings End 123 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 123"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Chapter Three 124 sea is symbolic of Torah, and Torah is the fullness of divine blessing, male birkat yhwh, that is, the fullness (male) that is the blessing of the Lord (birkat yhwh) , the beginning (re’shit) that is the wisdom ( h okhmah) given to Solomon. The bestowal of wisdom is compared parabolically to the gifting of the daughter as a conjugal offering to the son by their mutual father. 46 From this parable the reader is encour- aged to heed the connection between “blessing” (berakhah) and “knee” (berekh) . How so? The “blessing” is the “place to which every knee bows down.” But what is this place? To understand this, we need another parable: Before one asks about the king, one must first ask about the dwelling of the king, sho’alim beito shel melekh te h illah. The house (bayit that is the beit) 47 about which one initially inquires (sho’alim te h illah) is the beginning (te h illah) that shelters but also exposes the king. 48 To this house prayers are directed in bending the knee and pledging the tongue. The blessing is the dwelling, the sheltering-exposing; the question of its loca- tion marks the beginning of the path. Here philological attunement is most expedient: the word te h illah stems from the root h ll, to perforate, to make a hole, to open, to be an opening. At/in the beginning is the gesture of opening. What can we say of this opening? That it opens, and as a consequence—or perhaps as a cause—that it is opened. But what is (en)closed in the opening that can be further opened? An opening, no doubt, but how and why might an opening be opened if it is already opened? To open the open, the open must be en(closed), for the opening of opening is enclosure, the circumference that encircles the center, the limit from without that delimits the limit within. Beginning, the beit with which Torah begins (mat h il) , is the opening that encloses the enclosing that opens, the questioning utterance that silences the silence of alef by exposing the shelter of the sheltered exposure. Why is beit closed on every side and open in front? 49 To teach you that it is the house of the world [ beit olam] . Thus, the holy One, blessed be he, is the place of the world but the world is not his place. 50 Do not read beit but bayit, as it is written, “Through wisdom a house is built” (Prov 24:3). 51 The shape of beit — closed on three sides and open in front — attests that wisdom/Torah is beit olam, that is, the enframing opening of the world. 52 Borrowing another insight of Heidegger to enunciate a kabbalistic perspective, nature may be viewed as the clearing that allows beings to appear. 53 More pro- foundly, Heidegger notes that phusis, “nature,” signifies the confluence (Fügung) of openness and self-concealment. “The occurring of openness allows for self- concealing to occur within its own occurring of openness; self-concealment can only occur, however, if it allows the occurring of openness to ‘be’ this Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 124"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Before Alef / Where Beginnings End openness.” To understand this coincidence of opposites one must be able to clarify what the “enigma of the essential ambivalence of phusis conceals,” and this would be tantamount to naming the “essence of the beginning.” 54 To think the essence of the beginning in bahiric terms is to ruminate over beit, enclosed opening of opened enclosure. The author of the text just cited consid- ered the question in terms of the letter’s shape. Beit is enclosed on three sides but open in front, signifying that it is beit olam, the dwelling within which temporal beings come to be in passing-away and pass away in coming-to-be. The meas- ure of this dwelling in the stream of coming-to-be and passing-away is deter- mined by and from wisdom, gnostically conceived as a potency of God, but its way is open, for in front there is empty space whence new possibilities abound. From the kabbalistic perspective this is the intent of the rabbinic dictum that God is the place of the world but the world is not his place. That is, all things in timespace are God even if God is not all things in spacetime. 55 The notion of world implicit in the hoary myth is dependent on the paradox of determinate indeterminacy, 56 that is, a structure that is at once closed and open, formed and formless. 57 This is the esoteric significance of the orthography of beit, the mark that inscribes the beginning that is second. The inscription, however, is con- comitantly an erasure, for the beit that begins Torah veils the alef whence it orig- inates. The role of Torah as preserving the concealment of that which must be concealed is alluded to in the following bahiric text: R. Bun said: Why is it written “From eternity [me-olam] I was fashioned, out of the origin [me-ro’sh] , before the earth” (Prov 8:23). What is “from eternity” [me-olam] ? The matter that must be hidden [lehe‘alem] from the entire world, as it is written, “he also puts the world in their hearts” (Eccles 3:11), do not read “the world” [ ha-olam] but “concealment” [ he‘elem] . 58 The Torah said: I was first [qiddamti] in order to be the origin of the world [ro’sh le-olam] , as it says, “From eternity I was fashioned, out of the origin.” 59 Based on a wordplay upheld in an older midrashic reading of the word le-olam, “everlastingly” (Exod 3:15) as le‘alem, “to conceal,” 60 the author of the above pas- sage connects ha-olam and he‘elem. Insofar as olam connotes both temporal perpetu- ity and spatial extension, as I noted briefly in chapter 2, an intrinsic link is forged between three ostensibly disparate concepts: worldhood, eternity, and conceal- ment. The rallying point of the three concepts is Torah, which is identified with the wisdom that is the subject of the verse “From eternity I was fashioned, out of the origin, before the earth” (Prov 8:23). The expressions me-olam, “from eter- nity,” and me-ro’sh, “out of the origin,” are synonymous. The intent of the verse, therefore, is to a‹rm that Torah derives from the origin (ro’sh, which is alef) that 125 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 125"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"precedes the beginning (re’shit, which is beit) . Only if we appreciate this will we be in a position to comprehend the significance of interpreting me-olam as lehe‘alem, “to be hidden.” In proclaiming its primordiality, Torah is asserting, albeit cryptically, that it conceals the “matter that must be hidden from the entire world,” which is the head, the illimitable origin, whence it springs forth. This, too, is the esoteric sense of the statement attributed to Torah: “I was first in order to be the origin of the world.” The phrase that I translate as “origin of the world” is ro’sh le-olam. I have opted for a literal rendering, but this may obscure the intended meaning. The context demands that the word le-olam be vocalized as le‘alem, “to conceal.” Once that is understood, then the expression assumes an altogether different valence. Ro’sh le-olam should be read as ro’sh le‘alem, “the origin that must be con- cealed.” Torah, which declares itself as the first (qiddamti) of all entities, 61 hides the origin before its beginning. Here we recall the comment of Heidegger cited above, “The origin keeps itself concealed in the beginning.” More concerning the beginning is disclosed in another bahiric unit that I con- sider expressive of an older layer of tradition: R. Amora sat and expounded: Why is it written, “And the sea is full of the Lord’s blessing, take possession on the west and south” (Deut 33:23)? In every place, beit is blessed, for it is the fullness [ ha-male] , as it says, “And the sea is full of the Lord’s blessing” [u-male birkat yhwh] . From there he gives drink to the needy and from the fullness he took counsel at the beginning [te h illah] . To what may this be compared? To a king who wanted to build his palace with hard granite. He cut out rocks and carved stones, and there emerged for him a well of abundant living water. The king said: Since I have flowing water, I will plant a garden and I will delight in it [eshta‘ashe‘a bo], the whole world and I, as it is written, “I was with him as a confidant, a source of delight [sha‘ashu‘im] every day” (Prov 8:30) . The Torah said: For two thousand years I was delighting in his lap [ be- h eiqo sha‘ashu‘im], as it says, “every day” [ yom yom], and his day [ yomo] is one thousand years, as it says, “For in your sight a thousand years are like yesterday” (Ps 90:4). 62 From here forward it is temporarily [le-ittim], as it says, “in every time” (Prov 8:30), but the remainder [ ha-she‘ar] everlastingly [le-olam], as it says, “my glory I will hold in for you” (Isa 48:9). What is “my glory” [tehillati]? As it is written, “a praise [tehillah] of David, I will extol you” (Ps 145:1). What is the praise? For “I will extol you” [aromimkha]. And what is exaltation [romemut]? For “I will bless your name forever and ever” (ibid.). And what is the blessing? To what may this be compared? To a king who planted trees in his garden, even though rain has fallen, the [garden] draws constantly and the ground is moist, he must irrigate [the trees] from the spring, as it says, “The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, a sound understanding for all who Chapter Three 126 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 126"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"practice it” (ibid., 111:10). If you say she will be lacking something, thus it says, “Praise of him [tehillato] is everlasting” (ibid.). 63 The beit is the fullness with which God took counsel at the beginning—an obvious allusion to Torah, which is depicted in similar terms in the rabbinic tra- dition, based on the image of wisdom in Proverbs 8:30 as the playmate with which God is enrapt two thousand years prior to creation. Note, again, that the word for beginning is te h illah, the expression used in conjunction with the ques- tion of the whereabouts of the bayit that shelters and exposes the king, the beit that begins Torah, beginning of the opening that is the opening of beginning. 64 The author of the bahiric passage renders the aggadic motif of the God of Israel bemusing and amusing himself with Torah by the parable of a king who hap- pens upon an abundant spring as he cuts through the quarry of stone he is using to build his palace. The latter, we are to suppose, will be surrounded by a gar- den, but only if there is a flow of living water can the king plant the garden in which he and the inhabitants of the world will delight. 65 The fullness of wisdom encompasses both the source of irrigation and the garden that is irrigated. The poetic images convey in visual terms the two prin- ciples that depict the basic dialectic within the divine nature, according to kab- balistic theosophy: 66 the outpouring power of mercy and the constraining force of judgment. 67 Although not stated explicitly, one may infer that the spring (ma‘ayan) and garden (gan) betray these characteristics gendered respectively as masculine and feminine. 68 Wisdom is beit, for it is both the (phallic) spring that overflows and the (vaginal) garden that is watered, projecting-in and opening- out, exposed enclosure of enclosed exposure. The doubling of self to be the other stands at the beginning of the way. But what words are appropriate to begin the account of the beginning, ma‘aseh bere’shit, the beginning that calls forth the duplicity of the beginning? God delights with his fullness. 69 What kind of delight is intended? At this point, attentiveness to language is most warranted. The frolic of God with Torah/ wisdom is designated sha‘ashu‘a, an archaic locution attested in several critical places in Hebrew scripture (Prov 8:30–31 and Ps 119:24, 70, 77, 92, 143, 174). The term denotes delight connected to wisdom (and, by extension, to Torah) on the part of God and on the part of the human. 70 This connotation is implied in the bahiric text, but what novel interpretation of the ancient word may be discerned from the medieval collection of kabbalistic lore? What new thought is repeated, what new teaching is reiterated? We must listen more carefully to the term sha‘ashu‘a. Apparently, it stems from the root she‘a, which means to divide, to separate. To apprehend the nature Before Alef / Where Beginnings End 127 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 127"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"of sha‘ashu‘a, therefore, it is necessary to think through the alliance of delectation and division. What delight is there in dividing and parting? The jouissance of beginning, for beginning entails the rapture of irruption and cohesion of sepa- ration, the doubling and splitting of which I have already spoken. Sha‘ashu‘a must be thought from the vantage point of the nexus of beginning and division. To appreciate the fuller implications of this connection, a prox- imity that promotes rather than impedes difference, one would do well to con- sider another bahiric text. Interestingly, in the pertinent passage, disclosure of the kabbalistic secret is portrayed as the task of students expounding before their master, R. Berechiah: They began and said: Originarily — one [ bere’shit e h ad] . “Spirit before me is faint, I am the one to create souls” (Isa 57:16). “The channel of God is full of water” (Ps 65:10). What is the “channel of God” [peleg elohim] ? Thus our master taught us that the holy One, blessed be he, took the waters of creation and divided them. He placed half of them in heaven and half of them in the ocean, as it is written, “God divided the fullness of water.” By means of them a man studies Torah, as it is said, “Through the merit of acts of kindness [gemilut h asadim] a man studies Torah, as it says, ‘All who are thirsty come for water, even if you have no money’ (Isa 55:10), go to him and he will act with kindness towards you, and ‘you will stock up on food and eat’ (ibid.).” 71 The secret here—as elsewhere in the bahiric anthology—is revealed through mytho-theosophic exegesis, that is, reading Hebrew scripture as a narrative about the inner nature of God, a narrative that may have been shaped by older mythical dicta transmitted independently of the scriptural text but nonetheless anchored therein and deduced therefrom. 72 More specifically, the exegesis placed in the mouth of R. Berechiah’s students, which includes a teaching received directly from the master, is meant to explain the ontic transition from the incomposite oneness prior to creation to a division within the one, God’s becoming-other, which logically entails three modes of relatedness: for the other, with the other, in the other. The first word of Torah, bere’shit, alludes to the unity before the threefold oth- ering of the one, a unity that technically is before there is one, for in being one there would be two and consequently one to divide. Thus, bere’shit is interpreted by the gloss e h ad, that is, e h ad is apposite to bere’shit: bere’shit e h ad, “originarily— one.” 73 Division, on the other hand, is tied exegetically to Isaiah 57:16, ki rua h mi-lefanay ya‘a t of u-neshamot ani asiti, “for spirit before me is faint, I am the one to create souls,” and to Psalm 65:10, peleg elohim male mayim, which I will leave untranslated for the moment. The bahiric homily engages the meaning of the Chapter Three 128 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 128"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"latter verse but is completely silent about the former. The silence notwithstand- ing, it is appropriate to begin with a brief comment about this verse. A distinct meaning was evidently assumed by the exegete whose words (at least in part and in some form) have been preserved in the written recensions of Bahir, and we must try to recover something of it by listening assiduously. Ki rua h mi-lefanay ya‘a t of u-neshamot ani asiti, “for spirit before me is faint, I am the one to create souls.” I assume this verse should also be read mytho-theosophically. We must first ascertain who is speaking. The answer is offered in the poetic- liturgic utterance of the prophetic text itself: ram we-nissa shokhen ad we-qadosh shemo, “high and exalted, everlastingly dwelling, holy is his name” (Isa 57:15). The intent of the verse, when read kabbalistically, is to emphasize that souls are cre- ated by this high and exalted one whose name is holy, not by the spirit (rua h ) that falters before him. 74 If we were to translate the mythopoeic imagery into Neoplatonic terms, we could speak of the creation of souls evincing the move- ment from the one beyond one to the one that is many, the one that encompasses division issuing from the one that is indivisible. 75 This transition marks the begin- ning and hence it is symbolized by beit, the second that is first. 76 Further support may be adduced from the verse peleg elohim male mayim. Its plain sense is: “the channel of God is full of water.” The esoteric exegete, however, read (in the double sense of interpreted and vocalized) the word peleg as palag, “to divide,” thereby changing the syntax of the verse. The proper noun peleg elohim, “channel of God,” is turned into predicate and subject, palag elohim, “God divided.” Moreover, the expression male mayim is not the predicate nominative “is full of water,” but the nominative “fullness of water.” The overall meaning of the verse, therefore, is that God divided the fullness of water. To what does this refer? To the primordial division of waters, an ancient theme in Israelite cosmogonic myth. In the bahiric text, what else do we hear about the separation of upper and lower waters? We are told that by means of these waters one studies Torah. This statement is equated with a maxim, presented anonymously in some manu- script recensions and attributed to a specific rabbi in other recensions, 77 that one merits studying Torah through acts of kindness, gemilut h esed. I have not suc- ceeded in locating a source or even a precise parallel to the maxim as it is cited in Bahir, but it is easy enough to list a number of rabbinic dicta wherein a tight connection is drawn between Torah and charitable, compassionate behavior. 78 On balance, it seems to me, the bahiric text offers an interpretation of a maxim that circulated independently in either oral or written form. If, for the sake of argument, we assume this to be case, then the critical question is: how did the author of the bahiric text understand the maxim? By the merit of the water that was divided at the beginning—indeed the divi- sion that is the beginning—one studies Torah. The fullness of water, male mayim, Before Alef / Where Beginnings End 129 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 129"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"refers technically to the e›uence of divine wisdom, the sea that is Torah, 79 the daughter beloved to her father and given as a matrimonial gift to her brother. It thus makes perfectly good sense to associate the division of waters and the study of Torah. Moreover, the latter is connected to acts of kindness. This connection is interpreted in the following way: he who wishes to study must go to the source of the water, the beit - bayit that is the beginning, the plentitude of wisdom/ Torah, and from there a flood of mercy will issue forth. 80 The overflow of wis- dom is expressed as the generosity of spirit that bestows deeds of kindness in the world, gemilut h asadim. We encountered this force before in the description of the gimmel at the beginning of the path, which we abruptly laid aside. Now, however, it is time to take hold of the matter, to grasp the symbolic intent of this letter. What is gimmel? It bestows (gomel) like a spring that erupts and waters the gar- den with the light/seed of wisdom that is hidden in the head (ba-ro’sh) , 81 the origin that is before there is one to begin because there is no second. Through the bestowal of the seed the distance separating alef and beit is bridged. Hence, gimmel may be viewed as the division that unifies that which is divided by divid- ing that which is unified. The possibility of gimmel is there from before alef, for without positing the third term, which is the link, one cannot conceive the divi- sion that is the beginning, the beit-bayit that exposes by sheltering alef. It might be protested that no mention of the letters is made in the bahiric account of waters parting at the beginning; how, then, can I introduce them into the mythologoumenon? This is a legitimate concern, one for which I have no decisive answer. I conjecture, however, that the myth of the division of the waters can be semiotically encoded and thereby linked to the passage that pre- serves and transmits the tradition regarding alef, beit, and gimmel. The one that is first before the beginning is signified by alef; the division of waters at the begin- ning by beit; the channel connecting upper and lower in the beginning by gimmel. This is the significance of the reference to gemilut h asadim in this context, for what sustains the earth is the overflow from heaven, the beneficence that comes by way of the conduit that bestows wisdom. 82 A similar beneficence facilitates the study of Torah. The full intent of this image is conveyed when one considers the implicit gender characteristics at work behind the letter symbolism. Although he did not state so explicitly, one can well assume that the author/transmitter of this pas- sage conceptualized the upper waters as masculine and the lower as feminine, a cosmological theme attested in classical rabbinic literature. The relevant refer- ences in the older texts make it unambiguously clear that the gender imagery has a decidedly sexual nuance. Thus, in the dictum of R. Levi, “the supernal waters are masculine and the lower feminine,” the earth that opens to receive the heavenly overflow, which is linked exegetically to Isaiah 45:8, is depicted Chapter Three 130 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 130"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"as “a woman opening for the man.” 83 If the upper is male and the lower female, the link connecting the two is presumably the phallus. This surmise would go well with the phallic image of the spring to which I have already referred, the spring of wisdom that emerges spontaneously from the rocks and waters the garden in which the king and his world delight. In an alternative mythic for- mulation, gimmel is the son that bridges the distance between alef and beit, father and daughter. 84 Gimmel, moreover, occupies a central role in the erotic play of sha‘ashu‘a. Indeed, the impetus for the division of the fullness that is the begin- ning arises from the springing-forth of gimmel, the will to bestow that stems from gemilut h esed, love as the incessant overflowing, projecting-open opening into the opening of the open-projection. 85 Prior to that point—which is tech- nically no point at all, since for one to conceive a point one must conceive a line but conceiving a line is not possible without conceiving two points—there is nothing but the oneness that transcends number. In the beginning is the split- ting of the waters, a rupture in the beginning. Thus the beginning is beit, signi- fying the duplicity brought about through division of the one before all divi- sion. Where do we see this divide most wholly? In time, in the beginning, at the beginning—for to begin, the beginning must have begun, otherwise it is no beginning. What begins, therefore, can only be what has already been what is yet to come. The kabbalistic import of the myth places sha‘ashu‘a at the beginning — following the rabbinic identification of wisdom as Torah—the first stirring that is the trace of what came before, the beit that begins Torah, the time of begin- ning in the beginning of time. The correlation of beginning and sha‘ashu‘a under- scores the temporal comportment of the primal ecstasy, which, quite literally in the kabbalistic symbolism, is an ek-stasis, standing out, an elongation of the line to be encompassed in the circle. 86 The connection between time and sha‘ashu‘a is already intimated in the verse from Proverbs wherein wisdom describes herself as being the delight before God “every day,” sha‘ashu‘im yom yom, and playing before him “in every moment,” mesa h eqet lefanav be-khol et. Insofar as wisdom was frolicking before God from the beginning—indeed, the beginning is nothing but this frolic— sha‘ashu‘a bears the footprint of temporality in the cyclical lin- earity of linear circularity. From the beginning we can deduce some general characteristics about time: To begin with, as I have already remarked, the beginning cannot begin, yet that which cannot begin cannot end. To be always beginning, then, is to be never ending, but to be never ending is to be always of the moment. To be always of the moment is to always be of the moment, that is, to begin in the beginning that cannot begin because it has already begun if it is the beginning that can(not) begin. The beginning is, in the language of Nagarjuna, the renowned Before Alef / Where Beginnings End 131 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 131"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Indian philosopher of the Middle Way (M a dhyamika) , the “primary arising” that produces the “arising of arising.” 87 The arising of arising entraps the mind in the insurmountable paradox of simultaneously a‹rming and denying the pos- sibility of arising: If there is an arising of arising, the arising will have already been, since in the absence of its having been we could not speak of its having arisen, but if it has already arisen, we cannot speak of it arising and conse- quently there can be no arising of arising. Temporality is measured by the moment that belongs to this primary arising of arising, the impossible that makes time possible, the beginning that cannot begin but as the ending that cannot end the beginning that cannot begin. What will be in time is the same as what was in time by virtue of being different than what is in time—differ- ent, that is, in virtue of being the same. Here, again, Heidegger is helpful: What is in time and is thus determined by time, we call the temporal. . . . Time and the temporal mean what is perishable, what passes away in the course of time. Our language says with greater precision: what passes away with time. For time passes away. But by passing away constantly, time remains as time. To remain means: not to disappear, thus, to presence. . . . Time is not a thing, thus nothing which is, and yet it remains constant in its passing away without being something temporal like the beings in time. 88 Applying the paradox of time poetically captured by Heidegger to the kab- balistic symbolism, we can say of sha‘ashu‘a that it persists in its passing, that it is most evidently when it is no more. The bliss at the beginning cannot be the beginning of bliss, for the beginning does not begin and remain beginning. Sha‘ashu‘a is thus always of the beginningless, and correspondingly endless, moment—no before, no after, no recollection, no expectation, momentary elation, present in its absence, ephemeral in its recurrence, eternal in its tran- sience. The joy at the beginning—the ecstasy of beginning that congenitally resists being the beginning of ecstasy—never was, for it never will not be. Yet, we must take to heart a distinction made in the bahiric text itself: There is a dif- ference between the two thousand years before creation and the span of time that follows creation. The former is characterized by sha‘ashu‘a that is “everlast- ing” (le-olam) , whereas the latter is characterized by mesa h eqet lefanav, “toying before him,” which is from time to time (le-ittim) . The transition from perpetual musing to intermittent play requires holding back and the setting of a boundary. The notion of withdrawal, itself withdrawn and thus not stated overtly, is a secret exegetically derived from the verse lema‘an shemi a’arikh appi u-tehillati e h etam lakh le-vilti hakhritekha, “For the sake of my name I will postpone my wrath and my glory I will hold in for you so that I will not Chapter Three 132 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 132"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"destroy you” (Isa 48:9). 89 The plain sense of the prophetic dictum relates to divine mercy expressed as God’s long-suffering, the capacity to restrain his rage. The expression tehillati e h etam, literally “my glory I will hold in,” is parallel to a’arikh appi, 90 “I will postpone my wrath.” One may surmise that at some point in ancient Israel the notion of a vengeful god yielded its opposite, the compas- sionate god who holds in his fury. In the bahiric text, only the second part of the verse is cited because the focal point is the constriction of tehillah, which has been rendered as the divine glory. But what resonance did the author of the bahiric passage hear in the scriptural verse that inspired his exegesis? The self-limitation expressed as inhaling the breath and holding in the glory makes possible the periodic moments of joy that God experiences with Torah/wisdom. Prior to the withholding, the father’s musing on the daughter had no temporal bounds; consequent to the withhold- ing, it is temporally bound. The contraction of divine glory through the hold- ing in of spirit/breath facilitates the movement from le-olam, “everlastingly,” to le-ittim, “ephemerally.” Time, which begins with the beginning that cannot begin, arises as a consequence of the constriction. The reader is told, moreover, that the glory that is held in for Israel: u-tehillati e h etam lakh (Isa 48:9), is the “praise of David,” tehillah le-dawid (Ps 145:1), 91 the praise that is exaltation (romemut) , the blessing of the name. These are different ways of referring sym- bolically to the glory, for it is comprised of the blessings of Israel and it is the praise that is uplifted to be placed again as a crown on the head. 92 The blessing is said to be “forever and ever,” le-olam wa‘ed, eternally, but it must always be of the moment, be-khol et, in every moment, from time to time, le-ittim. The rhythms of prayer are set by the seemingly primordial turning of time: the fad- ing of night into day and day into night, the return of the same as different and the evolution of the different as same. 93 This is the mystery of song, the secret of prayer. In every moment there is a beginning, and hence each moment is identical but distinctive, nay, identical because distinctive. To what may this be compared? To the king who waters his garden from the spring even though the ground is su‹ciently wet from rainfall. This image casts a shadow from which we may glean something about the beginning of time in the time of beginning. Time, as opposed to eternity, which is marked by the characteristic of having always been, must have a point of beginning, but to begin it cannot have begun without compromising its status as the beginning that will begin. The begin- ning, then, never ends; yet only that which ends everlastingly never ends. In bahiric imagery, the fount of wisdom—the phallic aspect of God, which is symbolized by gimmel, the force that bestows (gomel) goodness — ceaselessly overflows from alef to beit, but it is never depleted. Each time implies every time, from time to time, timelessly beginning, eternally returning.

In this musing/amusing is the primordial divide, what-is becoming self and other, the springing into being of what has been, the fullness that is depleted, the trace of alef in beit, which comes before it. The musing discloses something fundamental about the composition of time: each moment is because it incessantly becomes other than what it is. This is the way of sha‘ashu‘a, projecting out to hold in. The parabolic image of a king cutting rocks and carving stones in the effort to build his palace in all likelihood alludes to divine creativity through inscrip- tion, since inscribing, too, involves removing material, hollowing out a space on the stone surface, as the letters are engraved or etched. If this surmise be accepted, then sha‘ashu‘a should be depicted as a bemusing tied to the act of writ- ing and the object written. Especially against this background, the holding-in of the glory becomes palpable as the persistence of speech in the silencing of silence, the reverberation of inscription in the erasing of erasure. Moving beyond the positing of two elements that would have to be resolved dialecti- cally, we can imagine a convergence such that opposites are recognized as iden- tical because they are different. After all is said and done, can we think of a going-out that is not taking-in, a taking-out that is not going-in, an inside that is not outside the outside that is inside, an outside that is not inside the inside that is outside, a beginning that ends the ending that does not begin? In the bahiric parable I have found support for Heidegger’s contention that the “ontological condition for the understanding of being is temporality itself.” 94 For kabbalists, this condition is related to the contemplative musing of which I have spoken above, a be/musing that presupposes a division of the one, the doubling of beit, the beginning that is second. I would add that in bahiric fragments, and in subsequent kabbalistic literature based thereon, the corre- spondence of sha‘ashu‘a and temporality underscores the erotic dimension of time. Significantly, the bahiric text highlights, perhaps intensifies, the erotic quality of sha‘ashu‘a that may have been at play from the beginning. The imagery of irrigation, which has come up already, should be interpreted in light of this erotic/contemplative delight. The argument is bolstered by other fragments in the bahiric anthology wherein the image of water spreading over the garden more clearly alludes to sexual union—through phallic discharge—between male and female. 95 Here we also have to consider the accounts of the father’s desire for and cohabitation with the daughter scattered throughout the textual landscape of Bahir. I have discussed this motif elsewhere, 96 and I will not reproduce all the relevant texts again; but let me simply emphasize that the father’s amusing Chapter Three 134 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 134"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"himself through the daughter is inseparable from—indeed identical to—the father’s musing over the daughter. Two points that follow from this are worthy of consideration: First, the basic myth that explains the movement from the first that is not a beginning to the beginning that is second, from eternality to tem- porality, involves the splintering of wisdom into three — father, daughter, son—and the consequent yearning to restore a sense of integration and whole- ness. That desire is expressed in terms of either the father and daughter or the son and daughter, but both representations relate to the drive to reinstate the elemental unity of wisdom. Eros from this perspective may be viewed as the longing to retrieve a detached aspect of self. The impulse for the other, which underlies the sha‘ashu‘a that God has for Torah, the father-king for the daughter- princess, is an expression of this narcissism. 97 The second point of note is that the correlation between eros and noesis implied by the poetic image of sha‘ashu‘a in the bahiric fragment has persisted among kabbalists through generations. In a number of previous studies, I have posited that the epistemological matrix that informed the lived experience of medieval kabbalists allows us to speak concomitantly of the noetic quality of eros and the erotic quality of noesis. In the beginning, God contemplates his wisdom, the father delights with his daughter. Contemplative eros ensues from and results in the projecting-open, springing forward to leap back, drawing forth to let go. Logically, one can imagine projection without reception, but, ideally, the mythopoeic orientation of the kabbalists embraces both concur- rently. This dialectic marks the beginning, beit, of Torah, stuttering to be heard in the beginning of the way, setting out to break open the open that is broken. In the beginning that cannot begin, time comes to be in its having been. We are surely justified in translating the term sha‘ashu‘a as it is used in Sefer ha- Bahir and in later works of kabbalah by the Lacanian expression “jouissance,” that is, the ecstatic state of orgasmic unity wherein the self of consciousness does not relate to the other in its heterogeneity. 98 The happiness that does not concern the other, the drive that has no other, is jouissance, the surplus enjoy- ment that defies signification, what Lacan himself calls “knowledge of the real.” 99 No sooner do we inch forward on the path than we are sent back to the beginning. What is a drive without an other, a turning-toward without regard for the other? How can consciousness that has only itself as other be described? Even self-consciousness, consciousness of self, is predicated on the othering of other in the other of othering. This drive, what Lacan deems the “real” that resists being signified, has been described aptly as the “self-su‹cient closed cir- cuit of the deadly compulsion-to-repeat. The paradox is this: that which cannot ever be memorized, symbolized by way of its inclusion into the narrative frame, is not some fleeting moment of the past, forever lost, but the very insistence of Before Alef / Where Beginnings End 135 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 135"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"drive as that which cannot ever be forgotten in the first place, since it repeats itself incessantly.” 100 Precisely in the incessant compulsion to repeat lies the psychi- cal import of the myth of sha‘ashu‘a, the crisscrossing of time and being, language and eros, in consciousness that seeks itself as other. The drive to repeat is the beginning that can never be forgotten, since it has yet to be remembered. We can thus speak of an inexorable link between time, being, and eros in kabbalistic ontology from its very inception. This, I suggest, is the philosophic intonation of the mythic saying regarding alef, beit, and gimmel. To this saying we have tried to listen, but what can one hear of the sound made before alef, where beginnings end?

Celan Concerning the beginning, we have learned that it cannot begin if it has not already begun. To speak of the beginning, therefore, is to begin always in the middle, to begin at the beginning that is not beginning. But how do we speak of the middle? Surely from the middle. But what can be spoken from the mid- dle? By what sign do we mark the spot in the middle where beginnings end and endings begin? The letter mem signifies repetition of difference, re/marking the beginning, for the beginning, we recall, is branded by beit, the letter duplicitous in its sin- gularity: to be itself it must be before that in relation to which it is after. Like beit at the beginning, mem in the middle reverberates in its iteration. Stammering in the middle, however, is not the same as stuttering in the beginning. The lat- ter consists of the retrieval of what has never appeared, the former the return to where one has never been. Accordingly, mem, especially in its final or closed form, which is close in appearance to a square, is typically associated in kab- balistic texts with the divine potency that conveys both the mystery of teshuvah, repentance, literally, re/turn, and the secret of yovel, the jubilee that heralds the messianic redemption. The fusion of these two symbolic meanings yields a par- adox that illumines a fundamental tenet of the kabbalistic approach to time: to look ahead one must turn back, a restoration to a past that is always yet to come in the present of the future. Subsequently, we shall have the opportunity to pur- sue this symbolism in more detail, but su‹ce it to note at this juncture that the salvific import of contrition is linked to the redundancy of mem imprinted in and from the middle. 4 137 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 137"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Let me turn now to the depiction of mem in Sefer ha-Bahir, the same text that served as the basis for our analysis of alef. Departing, however, from the textual strategy deployed in the previous chapter, it will be necessary here to introduce other kabbalistic sources, including especially passages from zoharic literature, which will assist us in decoding the esoteric significance of mem and by conse- quence the symbolic status of the middle, which corresponds to the present tense. By heeding the assonance of mem, we attempt to take hold of the moment at hand, to grasp what cannot be grasped except by letting-go, clutching the reiteration of what has yet to be acclaimed. What is the open mem? The open mem is comprised of male and female, and the closed mem is made like the womb from above. Did R. Re h umai not say that the womb is like t eit? What he spoke of was from within and what I spoke of was from without. What is mem? Do not read mem but rather mayim. Just as these waters are moist so the womb is always moist. Why is open mem comprised of masculine and feminine and the closed [mem] masculine? To teach you that the essence of mem is masculine. The opening [of mem ] is added for the sake of the feminine. Just as the male does not give birth through the opening so the closed mem is not open, and just as the female gives birth and is open so the mem is closed and opened. Why did you include an open and closed mem? For it is said, do not read mem but rather mayim. The woman is cold 1 and thus needs to be warmed by the male. 2 Appropriately, the letter that corresponds to the middle has not one but two orthographic shapes, open (petu h ah) and closed (setumah) , varying in accord with the place it occupies in a given word. The sign in/of the middle must be twofold, transferential, liminal, elusive, demarcating the point that divides what recurs before from what persists after, delimiting the unrepresentable present. To speak of that which is in the middle is to seize the intermittent becoming of what has continuously been. Mem, the letter in the middle, imparts this sense of fluency and ephemeral density. This is the meaning of the exegetical injunction “do not read mem but mayim, ” which coincidentally, or perhaps intentionally, is repeated twice in the bahiric fragment. Mem, most elementally—that is, when heard at its philologi- cal root—denotes “water,” 3 which in the present context is associated with the womb, designated by the term be t en, 4 source of engenderment, matrix of life. Thus, it is posited that mem relates to the shape of the womb, or, to be more pre- cise, the womb can be envisioned as mem when viewed from outside; when viewed from inside, it has the shape of t eit.

Significantly, this is occa- sioned by an explanation of the last letter in the word ozen, “ear,” which consists of the three consonants alef, zayin, nun. The path mandates, therefore, that the reader attend the cadence of mem through the channel of ozen. The homilist begins by interpreting the verse “A prayer of the prophet Habakuk through rap- ture,” tefillah la- h avaquq ha-navi al shigyonot (Hab 3:1): “A prayer” [tefillah] — it should have been “praise” [tehillah] ! Rather [it is to instruct that] he who turns his heart from matters of this world and contemplates the work of the chariot [mistakkel be-ma‘aseh merkavah] will be received before the holy One, blessed be he, as if he prayed all day, as it says, “A prayer of the prophet Habakuk.” And what [is the meaning of ] “through rapture” [al shigyonot] ? As it says, “be rapt in her love constantly” [ be-ahavatah tishggeh tamid] (Prov 5:19). To what does this refer? The account of the chariot. 5 In this citation, prayer assumes a mystical valence, as it is correlated with the pietistic practice of withdrawing from the world, which facilitates contempla- tion of the chariot. 6 The exegetical link forged between al shigyonot, “through rapture,” and be-ahavatah tishggeh tamid, “be rapt in her love constantly,” intimates that in the illumined state the heart partakes of the lover’s abandon, absorbed in and with the beloved continually. In the mind of the anonymous homilist, the prophet is enrapt in envisioning the chariot, a rapture that has the quality of prayer. One is reminded of the contemplative ideal of avodah sikhlit, “intellectual worship,” which Maimonides presents at the end of the Guide of the Perplexed, an ideal achieved only by the spiritual elite, the philosophically enlightened mem- bers of the faith community; for them, true prayer consists of the employment of intellectual thought in constantly loving God, an experience attained prefer- entially in solitude and isolation (hitbodedut) . 7 Intellectual worship is character- ized by a passionate love (ishq) of God proportionate to one’s apprehension of God. This contemplative ideal is called in traditional theological language knowl- edge of the name, the ultimate datum of divine science, the metaphysical spec- ulation that Maimonides associates with the study of the chariot, an exegetical discipline that some ancient rabbis considered esoteric and hence to be guarded from public dissemination. In this state, the mind is filled with an “excess of love, so that no thought remains that is directed toward a thing other than the Beloved.” 8 Needless to say, the content of the chariot vision presumed in the bahiric text is quite distinct from the Maimonidean understanding, but there is conspicuous similarity with regard to the connection made between prophecy, Within Mem / Returning Forward 139 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 139"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"contemplation of the chariot, and worship that expresses an all-consuming love of God. 9 Although a number of thirteenth-century Spanish kabbalists reacted neg- atively to followers of Maimonides who supplanted the traditional liturgical prac- tice of verbal enunciation with the silent prayer of philosophic contemplation, 10 it is also the case that the kabbalists themselves—including some who were crit- ical of the spiritualization of prayer proffered by those inclined to an allegorical interpretation—cultivated an ideal of contemplative worship that featured the ascent of the mind to the sefirotic pleroma and its conjunction with divine thought, ma h shavah ha-deveqah. 11 This contemplation climaxes in the apophatic a‹rmation of that which extends infinitely beyond elocutionary language, the (ad)verbial gesture of speaking-away what is spoken, not through not-speaking but by speaking-not, which is a way of speaking nonetheless. 12 Apophasis and kataphasis should not be viewed as antinomies, for from the mystical standpoint the liturgical utterance ensues from the spot of transition from nothing to some- thing, a site marked by the coincidence of opposites. Speaking and not-speaking meet in the middle ground of speaking-not, that is, speaking the unspeakable, a saying that renders the ineffable effable and thereby preserves its ineffability. 13 The phenomenological contours of the contemplative consciousness are out- lined in the continuation of the bahiric homily through the guise of an exege- sis on the next verse in Habakuk’s vision, yhwh shama‘ti shim‘akha yare’ti, “Lord, I heard your teaching, I was in awe” (Hab 3:2). In spite of the obvious ocular nature of contemplation, attested in the technical locution mistakkel be-ma’aseh merkavah, referring to the prophet’s gazing at the narrative account of the char- iot—revelation and interpretation cannot be separated in the mind of the medi- eval kabbalist responsible for this text—the primary emphasis is placed on giv- ing ear to the teaching that has been written/spoken. 14 “Hearing” indicates understanding and “teaching” the “place wherein they listen to him” (maqom she-shom‘in bo) . 15 This place is not a physical site but rather a divine gradation, as we encountered in the preceding chapter with respect to the attribute of God referred to as the “place to which every knee bows down,” the “dwelling of the king” to which prayers are directed. 16 In the passage considered here, “place” signifies the locus of prophetic revelation, which is portrayed in auditory as opposed to visual terms. 17 But what did the prophet hear in this imaginal place that led him to declare a sense of marvel? Why [does it say] “I was in awe?” On account of the ear, which is in the image of alef, and alef is the first of all the letters [ro’sh le-khol ha-otiyyot]. Moreover, alef causes the existence [qiyyumam] of all the letters.

From alef all the letters emerge, and thus you see that it is their beginning [she-hi bi-te h ilatan], and it says, “the Lord is at their head” [wa-yhwh be-ro’sham] (Micah 2:13) . It has been established with respect to every name written yod he waw he, that the holy One, blessed be he, is unified and sanctified in holiness [meyu h ad ha-qadosh barukh hu mequddash ba-qodesh] . What is “in holiness?” In the holy palace [ be-heikhal qodesh] . Where is the holy palace? I would say in thought and that is alef, as it is written, “Lord, I heard your teaching, I was in awe.” 18 In this passage, much is disclosed about the meditational discipline cultivated by the Provençal kabbalists responsible for the redaction of Bahir in the second half of the twelfth century. 19 The pietistic routine, as may be gathered from sev- eral bahiric fragments and corroborated by other kabbalistic sources, consisted of elevating one’s thought to the limit of thought that extends limitlessly beyond thought. 20 Expressed semiotically, alef, which is compared to the ear and brain, is symbolic of the uppermost gradation of the divine—the thought that expands infinitely to the thoughtless, to that which thought cannot comprehend (she-ein ha-ma h shavah masseget) , in the locution employed in the commentary on Sefer Ye s irah that purports to preserve the teachings of Isaac the Blind. 21 Alef is identified, moreover, as the “holy palace” (heikhal qodesh) , 22 and is linked to the Tetragrammaton, an association based exegetically on the expression “the Lord is at their head” (wa-yhwh be-ro’sham) , that is, YHWH, the name that is “at the head”—”in the beginning”—is alef, which is the “first of all letters” (ro’sh le-khol ha-otiyyot) . In later kabbalistic literature, the identification of alef and YHWH is explained by decomposing the orthography of alef into yod on top and yod on bottom connected by waw in the middle. 23 The numerical value of yod, yod, and waw is twenty-six (10 + 10 + 6), which is the sum of YHWH (10 + 5 + 6 + 5). I think it unlikely that the author of this text assumes this numerology. I mention it, however, because the principle expressed by this numerological equivalence, the interchangeability of alef and YHWH, is the secret that is being divulged, albeit through a somewhat more circuitous route. Alef, representative of the letters more generally, is the palace in which the invisible is rendered vis- ible and the name by which the ineffable is addressed. Through the inscription of YHWH—in every place where we confront the appearance of this name— the holy One is unified and sanctified in the holy palace of alef, first of the let- ters of the alphabet (the means for the exploit of creation) and first of the let- ters of the Decalogue (the narrative recounting of the event of revelation). 24 It is the letter that comprises all the other letters that come forward from it, the let- ter compared to the image of the ear and brain, the letter that signifies God’s Within Mem / Returning Forward 141 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 141"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"infinite thought, which calls forth the enunciation of the name that cannot be enunciated but through the veil of the epithet, the garment/text of the other confronted in the projecting-out of the turning-in. 25 In the continuation of the homily, the connection between alef, the ear, and the thought of God that is without limit, is reiterated. “I heard” (sham‘ati) is again glossed as “I understood” (hevanti) . But what did the prophet hear that left him astonished? He contemplated the thought of the holy One, blessed be he [ hevin ma h shavto shel ha- qadosh barukh hu] . Just as thought has no limit, for men think they can descend even to the end of the world, so the ear has no end and it cannot be satiated, as it is writ- ten, “the ear cannot have enough of hearing” (Eccles 1:8). Why is this so? For the ear is in the image of alef, and alef is the essence of the ten commandments [aseret ha- dibberot] . Therefore, the ear cannot have enough of hearing. 26 The theosophic deciphering of the letters comprising ozen is presented as “another explanation” (davar a h er) of Habakuk’s prophetic pronouncement, “Lord, I heard your teaching, I was in awe,” yhwh shama‘ti shim‘akha yare’ti (Hab 3:2). The “hearing” (shemi‘ah) is decoded as a matter of contemplating and the “teaching” (shim‘ah) as a reference to God’s thought (ma h shavah) . The ear is an appropriate metaphor to depict this process, for just as divine thought has no limit and consequently cannot be thought except as the unthought, so the path to attain it can have no boundary and hence cannot be approached except as the unapproachable. The allegation that the ear has no limit rests on the presuppo- sition that this organ can never be satiated, that is, one can never have listened enough. The ear is thus correlated with the mystery that can be re/covered in the uncovering of alef, the “essence of the ten commandments” revealed to the Israelites at Sinai. It is likely that in the bahiric text, based on older rabbinic sources, the ten words refer metonymically to Torah, for the ten command- ments comprise the totality of 613 precepts. 27 Hence, the initial letter in the first word of the Decalogue, anokhi, “I” (Exod 20:2; Deut 5:6), is alef, the secret of YHWH, which encapsulates the entirety of Torah. We may presume further that in the passage from Bahir the ten commandments assume a theosophic intent inasmuch as they allude symbolically to the ten potencies through which God is manifest, a theme that was further embellished and creatively expanded in the historical unfolding of kabbalistic interpreters. 28 The homily continues with an explanation of zayin, the second letter in ozen: And what of zayin in ozen?

And what is its function here? To teach you that just as there is great wisdom in the ear without limit, so there is this force in all the limbs. What are the limbs? The seven ones that are in man, as it is written, “he created him in the image of God” (Gen 1:27), in all of his limbs and in all of his parts. 29 In contrast to alef, which denotes limitless thought and is thus imaged by the ear whose listening comes to no end, zayin relates to that which is delimited, for it communicates that the name is essential, since it necessarily partakes of the substance (inyan) that it names. The relation between name and manifestation is portrayed by the analogy of the transplanted branch that becomes thereby the root of the tree, an idea linked exegetically to the repetition of shin in the word shoresh. Zayin, moreover, alludes to the seven potencies, which are correlated with the seven days of creation. We may reasonably suppose that the seven potencies, seven days, and seven limbs are symbolic ciphers that allude to the seven divine attributes. In the continuation of the passage, the limbs are delineated as two hands, two thighs, head, torso, penis and corresponding female genitalia [ berit milah we-zugo] , which are counted as one, to make the total of seven. 30 The mystery of the divine pleroma is encoded in the first two letters of ozen, for they betoken the limitless one (alef) delimited in the measure of seven (zayin) . 31 In other bahiric passages, the realm of godly power is also conceived as an enumeration of seven attributes or, in the language of one text, seven holy forms ( s urot qedoshot) . 32 When the letter symbolism is viewed philosophically, the demarcation of divine potencies by alef - zayin suggests that apophatic and kat- aphatic elements cannot be separated. 33 That is, theosophic gnosis encompasses envisioning the limitless that withdraws limitedly (alef) and the limit that extends limitlessly (zayin) . But even the former, it should be remembered, is rep- resented anthropomorphically.

To teach you that the brain is the essential part of the spinal cord and from there it draws constantly. If not for the spinal cord, the brain would not exist, for the entire body is for the sake of the brain, and if the entire body did not exist, the brain would not exist. Thus the spinal cord pours forth to the whole body from the brain, and this is the bent nun. But this nun [in ozen ] is the elongated nun! The elongated nun always comes at the completion of a word to teach you that the elongated nun comprises the bent and the elongated, but the bent is the foundation. This teaches you that the elongated nun comprises male and female. 34 With the last letter of ozen, the nun that opens our path to mem, the anthropo- morphic imagery grows concomitantly more vivid and more obscure. Zayin, which has the numerical value of seven, signifies the limbs of God’s bodily form; nun alludes to the brain, which is portrayed as the essential part of the spinal cord, 35 for the spinal cord draws constantly from the brain and pours forth to the other parts of the body. 36 The reader is told, moreover, that the nun at the end of a word comprises both orthographic forms, elongated (arukhah) and bent (kefufah) . In addition, the elongated nun is described as comprising both masculine and feminine. The bent nun, by contrast, must be gendered as either male or female. Given the identification of the bent nun with the brain and spinal chord, it stands to reason that the former possibility is more likely. To what body part, then, does the elongated nun refer? Which of the limbs can account for the gender dimorphism linked to this letter? The elongated nun, I propose, is correlated with the membrum virile as the extension of the brain and spinal chord, which are demarcated by the bent nun. 37 The contextualization of the male-female binary in the phallus implies that the feminine is ontically derived from and therefore comprehended in the masculine. 38 That ontological primacy accorded the masculine is a‹rmed in the Bahir by the assertion that the bent nun is the letter’s “foundation” (kefufah yesod) . It is at this seam in the text that the discussion of the open and closed mem with which we began the chapter appears. Fittingly, the deliberation on mem is interposed in the middle of the conversation on nun. The letter that is the sign- post of the middle displays itself by breaking into the middle, inter/posing, inter/rupting, rupturing, creating the semblance of with/out, with/in. To ascertain the intent of this interposition, we need to take into account the con- cluding remarks on nun, which succeed the comment that the woman is cold and thus needs to be warmed by the male: “And why did you include [the dou- ble form of nun ]? As it is written, ‘while the sun lasts, his name will be yinnon ’ (Ps 72:17), on account of the double nun, the bent and elongated nun, and he must come to be through male and female.” 39 The bahiric text is based on the aggadic decoding of the word yinnon as a Chapter Four 144 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 144"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"proper name of the messiah. 40 Scholem surmised that the double nun in yinnon indicates that messianic redemption proceeds from the union of masculine and feminine aspects within the Godhead. This exegetical remark thus validates the earlier observation that the bent and elongated forms of nun correspond respec- tively to male and female. 41 According to Scholem, moreover, the “Jewish gno- sis” preserved in this bahiric passage is to be contrasted with the “antinomian and encratist” tendencies expressed in gnostic gospels, that is, medieval kabbal- istic teaching portrays redemption as the union of masculine and feminine, whereas the ancient gnostic soteriology posits the overcoming of sexual differ- entiation. In my judgment, this distinction is erroneous, for the kabbalistic ideal of redemption is predicated on a similar ontological conception of the male androgyne according to which the female is comprised within the male. 42 Nonetheless, I concur with Scholem’s surmise that gender dimorphism is the critical element of the “Jewish gnosis” promulgated in the bahiric passage, though I would cast the matter of the nun in a different historical register, one that provides an opening to the mystery of mem. The exegesis of the double nun in yinnon can be seen profitably as a response to the doctrine of the virginal conception of Jesus promoted in medieval Christian polemical treatises against Jews, which were especially prominent in the twelfth century when the attempt to convince Jews of the “mechanics of the Incarnation” was based on an appeal to observable natural phenomena per- ceived by the senses and understood by reason. 43 The remark that the messiah must be propagated through the conjunction of masculine and feminine ( s arikh lihyot al yedei zakhar u-neqevah) appears to be a direct challenge to the foundational dogma of the Church. 44 Needless to say, in the period of the redaction of the Bahir, Christianity was not monolithic—indeed, at no time in history has it been — and surely some authors could have accommodated the notion that Jesus came to be from the union of male and female. None, however, could have comfortably interpreted the matter somatically, presuming thereby that Jesus was conceived in a womb fertilized by semen discharged physically by an actual man. 45 But it is precisely this view that underlies the bahiric explication of the double nun in the name yinnon, offering a naturalistic conception of the birth of the messiah that is antithetical to the supernatural understanding implied in the doctrine of the Incarnation. 46 The polemical point is sharpened when we examine more carefully the sym- bolic value assigned to the letter, for the parabolic approach deployed by the kabbalists responsible for the (relatively final) redaction of Sefer ha-Bahir is pred- icated on the hermeneutical assumption that the inner core safeguards and solidifies the external shell. Hence the double nun in yinnon not only signifies the birth of the messiah from the coupling of man and woman; it also marks the Within Mem / Returning Forward 145 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 145"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"ontological locus of sexual differentiation within the divine. This, I surmise, should be identified as the phallus, or more precisely, the circumcised phallus, which is the vantage point, the angle of vision, whence the male-female polar- ity is specularized. The phallocentric orientation in relation to the letter nun is indicated overtly in another passage in the bahiric anthology, which, in my opinion, preserves an older mythologoumenon: “What is s addi? Yod nun, s addi and his mate, yod and nun. Thus it is written, ‘Righteous, foundation of the world’ [ s addiq yesod olam] (Prov 10:25).” 47 Orthographically, s addi can be decomposed into yod perched on top of nun, an alignment that expresses symbolically the privileged posture of man and woman cohabiting. The letter is a sign that brings to mind the image of sexual union, but that image itself portends something other than what it is, namely, the phallic potency of God, s addiq, yod - nun, the righteous one who is the foundation of the world. The contextualization of both genders in the masculine eradicates sexual difference, not by creating the space for genuine otherness either through a‹rming two irreducible identities (there is both male and female) or by moving beyond dimorphic polarities altogether (there is neither male nor female) but by positing the reign of the same, which I identify as the law of the phallus operative in the semiotic phallocentricism of kabbalistic texts. 48 The possible Christological resonance is enhanced by the following allusion to Jesus in the interpretation of the letter s addi preserved in one of the recensions of Otiyyot de-Rabbi Aqiva, a relatively late midrashic compilation that preserves in rudimentary form older esoteric teachings: S addi, why does it have two heads? Because this refers to Jesus who took hold of two heads, one of Israel and the other of Edom, and he went and caused people to err. When the Jews saw him they stood over him, captured him, and hung him on the cross. As they interpreted “If your brother, your mother’s son, entices you” (Deut 13:7), it does not say “your father’s son.” 49 Later kabbalistic sources, as attested in a key passage in Zohar, 50 combine the bahiric decomposition of s addi into yod-nun with the midrashic interpretation of s addi as a symbolic reference to Jesus. It has been suggested that yod-nun in the zoharic text serves as an acrostic for yeshu no s ri. 51 Even if we do not assume this was the bahiric author’s intent, can we propose the Christological myth as its conceptual underpinning? Did the anonymous kabbalist intend to turn an axiom of Christian eschatology on its head? Did he wish to assert that the real s addiq is not the messianic redeemer born of a barren womb never polluted by seminal fluid but the cosmic foundation, the mundane manifestation of the Chapter Four 146 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 146"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"androgynous phallus in the sefirotic pleroma, the divine potency ritually embodied in the circumcised flesh of the Jewish male semiotically sealed with the inscription of the divine name? 52 As I have suggested, this is precisely the metaphoric implication of the double nun in yinnon. We are now in a better position to comprehend the bahiric interpretation of the two shapes of mem. Insofar as the essence of mem relates to the masculine— iqqar ha-mem hu ha-zakhar — it follows that the closed mem, which is depicted as masculine, discloses the symbolic nature of the letter. But the closed mem, we have already noted, is associated with the shape of the womb “from above” or when it is looked at “from without.” How do we account for this apparent dis- crepancy? 53 The masculine depiction of the closed mem and the image of the womb evinces that, in the absence of male seed, the woman is like the man who does not give birth through his opening, presumably the aperture of the penis. By contrast, the open mem, which comprises male and female, is a sign of the fertile womb because it contains both male and female. 54 Encoded in this pas- sage is a highly complex relationship between the male organ and the womb, a conceptual mesh that one might well expect in an androcentric worldview: even the womb, the source of generative power that biologically distinguishes woman from man, is pilfered by the male imaginary and rendered in phallic terms. The womb yet to be filled with semen is compared to the hole of the male organ, for without a ground in which to plant its seed the penis is not pro- creative. 55 Yet the womb, represented by closed mem, is essentially masculine. To pro/ject, to open its opening, the womb must receive the seed of the male, a receiving that transforms the status of the feminine receptacle to masculine benefactor. The gender metamorphosis is conveyed in the midrashic gloss of mem as mayyim, that is, the watery texture of the womb renders it necessary for the woman to be warmed by man. Consequently, the womb that retains the semen is portrayed as open mem, the joining of masculine and feminine. The tradition preserved in the Bahir presumes that the closed mem represents the womb that has not been inseminated; such a womb being infertile, it thus could not have conceived the messiah described as the “son born of woman.” 56 An exegetical frame for this hermeneutical conflict may be located in the mes- sianic meaning ascribed to the closed mem in the expression le-marbbeh ha-misrah, “In token of abundant authority” (Isa 9:6). In response to Christian exegetes who interpreted the closed mem as a reference to the virgin womb and the savior-god born therefrom, the kabbalist insinuates that the letter in this ortho- graphic shape signifies sterility, an inability to extend the body of engender- ment, in Mospik’s telling phrase. 57 One zoharic homily, in particular, is an especially significant locus for the kabbalistic polemic against the Christological doctrine of the virginal conception and birth of the messiah. 58 Briefly, the hom- Within Mem / Returning Forward 147 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 147"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"ily focuses on two letters, final mem and he, which are assigned to Binah, referred to as the “supernal world” (alma ila’ah) or the “world of the masculine” (alma di- dekhura) , in contrast to Shekhinah, the “lower world” (alma tata’ah) or the “world of the feminine” (alma de-nuqba) . When Binah is consolidated as a point sealed within the supernal thought ( H okhmah) , she is depicted iconographically as the final mem, in the shape of a square closed on all four sides. In this state, Binah, the divine mother, cannot give birth, as the zoharic author explicitly declares: “This is the mystery of Abram, ever mem, this one does not reproduce, for it is the closed mem, and it is not generative.” 59 However, when the he is added to Abram, his name is changed to Abraham, which can be decoded as ever-he-mem, that is, the organ (ever) that turns mem into he, the open womb that signifies fer- tility and reproductivity. I translate here the section of the homily in which the polemical intent of the messianic explication is rendered overtly in the specific terms of circumcision, a long-standing issue that divided the religious sensibil- ities of the two liturgical communities: When the he is added [to Abram], that final mem opens up . . . and that organ [ever] produces offspring, and this is the mystery of [the name] Abraham, ever he-mem, this is the one that reproduces and brings about progeny. . . . [T]his organ was not rec- tified until the he came along .... Whence do we know that this organ is rectified only by the he? When [his name was] Abram, that organ was not circumcised and it was not rectified. After the he came along, that organ was rectified, and it was cir- cumcised to produce offspring by means of the final he. When the supernal world is sealed in the final mem, that organ was not rectified, the foreskin existed without having been circumcised. The lower gradation exists in the form of the foreskin in the letter dalet, within the impoverished one. When the supernal world is within the concealment in the mystery of the letter of the final mem, the lower world is impov- erished in the mystery of the letter dalet. When the supernal world opens from the final mem and becomes a he, then the phallus [ berit] is rectified and the foreskin is removed .... And this is the mystery of “In token of abundant authority and of peace without limit upon David’s throne and kingdom, that it may be firmly estab- lished” (Isa 9:6). Mem rabbah [is derived from] le-marbbeh, and this is the mystery of when the letter mem has abundant authority, for the overflow above is augmented, and it opens up and becomes a he, and then [we can speak] “of peace without limit” [u-leshalom ein qe s ] . What is “of peace”? “Of peace” refers to the organ that is the foundation of the world [ever yesoda de-alma] , for the foreskin, which is surely called the “end of all flesh” [qe s kol basar] (Gen 6:13), is removed from it. “Of peace with- out limit” — the [foreskin] is removed, and peace sits “upon David’s throne and kingdom, that it may be firmly established in justice and in equity.” All this occurs when the final mem opens, and the foreskin is removed, and the dalet is transformed, as it has been said, and this is the mystery of “This is the blood of the covenant [dam ha-berit] that the Lord now makes” (Exod 24:8). 60 Chapter Four 148 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 148"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The instrument that opens the womb and thereby effects the transformation, which is both semiotic and gendered, is the circumcised phallic potency, which is linked historically and emblematically to the figure of Abraham. The fecun- dity of the womb is notionally correlated with the phallocentric rite of circum- cision, as it is the blood of the covenant—the word for blood is dam, which is composed of dalet and mem — that opens the mem, the womb of the mother, and transposes the dalet, the sign of poverty and infertility, into a he, the sign of e›u- ence and fertility. The messiah, according to the Jewish tradition, will emerge from a womb that has been impregnated by male seed. In the bahiric text, the fecund womb is demarcated not by the he but by the open mem, the fusion of male and female, the event in the mundane cosmos symbolically homologous with the heteroerotic conjunction in the Godhead, 61 a theme that is expressed in the zoharic passage by the image of the phallic gradation, which is designated “peace” (shalom) , sitting upon the throne of David. 62 An admittedly later source, the thirteenth-century Christian work Pugio Fidei, supports this interpretive stance . In this treatise, Friar Raymond Martin a‹rms that the closed mem of le-marbbeh ha-misrah alludes to the virgin womb whence Jesus was born. Furthermore, he relates this exegesis to two talmudic dicta. 63 It is worth considering these two texts carefully, as Friar Raymond’s readings may sensitize us to nuances at play in the kabbalistic sources, particularly in the thir- teenth and fourteenth centuries. The first talmudic text preserves a homiletical reflection attributed to Bar Qappara in Sepphoris and transmitted by R. Tan h um. 64 Inquiring about the obvious orthographic anomaly of the closed mem appearing in the middle of the word le-marbbeh, Bar Qappara responds by saying that the closed form alludes to the fact that God yielded to the protestation of the attribute of judgment (middat ha-din) not to make Hezeqiah the messiah, since he did not utter a hymn expressing gratitude for the miracles wrought on his behalf. The postponement of the divine intention and the (temporary) closure of the hope for messianic redemption are symbolized by the closed form of the letter placed where we would have expected the open form. In the continuation of the homily, another explanation is offered for the closed mem, one that leads the reader deeper into the maze of rabbinic myth. The earth is said to have opened its mouth and beseeched God to ignore the urging of the attribute of judgment. Imploring God to make Hezekiah the messiah, the earth promised to offer a song in his place. The prooftext cited to bolster the argument is “From the end of the earth we hear songs, glory to the righteous one” [mi-kenaf ha-are s zemirot shama‘nu s evi la- s addiq] (Isa 24:16). The angelic archon of the world (sar ha-olam) intercedes on behalf of the earth, “Master of the world! Perform his will [ s ivyono] for this right- eous one,” but a voice from heaven (bat qol) responds by citing the continuation Within Mem / Returning Forward 149 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 149"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"of the verse, “it is a mystery to me, it is a mystery to me” (razi li razi li) . According to the rabbinic homilist, these words herald that Hezekiah would not be pro- claimed messiah, for the redeemer, who is the righteous one ( s addiq) , remains hidden with God, an occlusion encoded in the closed mem of le-marbbeh. When the prophet inquires how long this concealment will last, the voice from heaven responds by citing the rest of the verse: “The faithless have acted faithlessly; the faithless have caused faith to be veiled” (bogdim bagadu u-veged bogdim bagadu) . The almost incantational utterance informs us that the messiah is hidden until the time of blasphemy—from the root bgd, to cover over, to hide one’s intent, to act under false pretense, to severe the enclosure of faith. The Christological interpretation is buttressed by the second talmudic state- ment, according to which the open mem denotes ma’amar patua h , the “revealed say- ing,” and the closed mem, ma’amar satum, the “concealed saying.” 65 As might be expected, Friar Raymond renders ma’amar as verbum Dei, the divine logos. In his mind, both aggadic aphorisms intimate that the closed mem of le-marbbeh bespeaks the dis/closure of Christ from the sealed womb in which he was occluded. Are these associations implicit in the relevant bahiric texts? To deal with this question adequately would necessitate exploring the various currents of eso- tericism that run through the textual landscape of the Bahir. Such an undertak- ing will have to await another opportunity; for now, su‹ce it to note that even if we lay aside the disputatious strategy, the symbolic decoding of mem and nun undeniably suggests at the very least a messianic context: nun refers to messiah and mem to the womb whence he comes to be. 66 To speak of mem steadfastly, in the stammer of its forbearance, we would do well to mull over the relationship between the messiah and the middle. Should we not expect the messiah at the end? What has the messiah to do with mem? Can the middle give an account of the end without necessitating the end of the middle? What is underway from before to after? Messianic expectation—awaiting the end—is entwined with the point that belongs squarely in the middle of the circle. This we learn from the final mem, whose quadrangular shape marks the way to discern the nature of teshuvah, “repentance,” the promise of return sheltered within the hope of sending forth. To grasp more fully the sway of this symbol, we must be attentive to the image of the mother’s womb whence the entrusting of time comes back in the giving before, the for/giving, 67 for the key that allows us to comprehend the tempo- ral dimension of mem , as situated in the breach in the middle of the beginning that mends the end, is the image of the mother. Admittedly, the link between the final mem, repentance, and the divine mother is not articulated explicitly in the bahiric fragments and thus to continue the journey we need recourse to other books. The Bahir, however, undoubtedly served as a basis for later devel- Chapter Four 150 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 150"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"opment; in fact, the seeds of the correlation between mem and the image of the mother are found in the following bahiric passage: R. Re h umai said: Why is it written, “Let the mother go, and take only the young, in order that you may fare well and have a long life” (Deut 22:7). It does not say “Let the father go,” but “Let the mother go,” corresponding to the one who is called mother in the world, as it is written, “You shall call understanding mother” (Prov 2:3).” 68 What [is the meaning of ] “and take only the young”? R. Re h umai said: The very children that she raised. And what are they? The seven days of Tabernacles.” 69 This fragment apparently reflects a later redactional stratum based on a more fully developed theosophic doctrine of ten potencies. The immediate context is focused on clarifying the relationship of the lower seven attributes to the source whence they come to light. The source, presumably the eighth emanation, is identified as “understanding” (binah) 70 and also as “mother in the world” (em ba- olam) , and the lower seven are designated as the seven children nurtured by this mother, and also as the seven days of Tabernacles. In the continuation of the text, the maternal hypostasis is designated a s eret, one of the terms used by the rabbis to refer to the holiday of Pentecost. The author of the bahiric text observes that the expression miqra qodesh, “sacred occasion,” is used with respect to both Pentecost (Lev 23:21) and Tabernacles (ibid., 35–36), although in the case of the former only one day is so called, whereas in the case of the latter the first and last days are so described. Accounting for this distinction, he notes: Why is a s eret one day? Because the Torah was given to Israel on it, and when the Torah was initially cre- ated the holy One, blessed be he, ruled in his world alone with her, as it is written, “The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord” (Ps 111:10). He said: Since it was so your holiness will be for you alone. 71 A connection is forged between Binah and Pentecost, the festival that, accord- ing to rabbinic lore, celebrates the Sinaitic epiphany and the giving of Torah to the Jewish people. The singularity of the event is enacted ritually in a one-day celebration, which also attests to the theological belief that there is only one divine power, the God of Israel, who governs the world by means of Torah. The link between this divine potency and Torah is reiterated from a different per- spective in a second passage, where explicit reference is made to the older rab- binic motif of ten logoi (ma’amarot) by means of which the world was created. 72 Within Mem / Returning Forward 151 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 151"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"In that section, the enumeration proceeds from top to bottom. The attribute associated in the previously discussed passage with a s eret, the one that comple- ments the seven, is here counted as third, succeeding keter elyon, the “supernal crown,” and h okhmah, “wisdom,” the second that is first (re’shit) . The third say- ing is described as the “quarry of Torah” (ma hs av ha-torah) , the “treasure of wis- dom” (o s ar ha- h okhmah) , 73 the “quarry of the spirit of God” (ma hs av rua h elohim) in which the forms of the letters of Torah were engraved. 74 Insinuated here is a tra- dition, expanded in the symbolic gesticulations of later kabbalists, especially in the Castilian circle, related (in ways still unclear) to the composition and redac- tion of zoharic material. I have in mind the portrayal of Binah as a womb that receives the seminal fluid of H okhmah, a kabbalistic notion rooted in the widely held anatomical conception that semen originates in the brain and descends through the spinal column to the penis whence it overflows in ejaculation. For the kabbalists, the seed-fluid is identified more particularly with the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Within the receptacle of Binah the letters germi- nate and gestate into more tangible form, into the bodily limbs of the divine anthropos, which is identified, moreover, as the four-letter name, YHWH, and as the primordial Torah. The converging of the semiotic and somatic imparted here opens the way to comprehending an essential feature of the incarnational element in medieval kabbalistic theosophy. Briefly put, “body” is a linguistic marker inscripted within the imagination as symbolic form. This imaginal body is literal in a very precise, indeed hyperliteral, sense, as it is composed of noth- ing but letters. 75 What does this have to do with time? To get back on track, we must consider again the nexus between Binah and the world-to-come. In the continuation of the bahiric enumeration of the ten cosmological logoi, the sixth one, the throne of glory, is designated the “dwelling of the world-to-come” (beit ha-olam ha-ba) , whose “place was engraved in wisdom” (meqomo h aquq ba- h okhmah) . The throne, which rests on the ground of wisdom, alludes symbolically to Shekhinah, also identified as the dwelling of the world-to-come. A dwelling, we observed in the preceding chapter, both shelters and exposes. How does the throne shelter and expose the world-to-come? A hint is provided in the prooftext: “And God said ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light” (Gen 1:3). The word “light” is men- tioned twice, corresponding to two lights in the divine realm, the world-to- come and the glorious throne, which is its dwelling. The lower light discloses the upper light in the manner that it is concealed. Thus, the bahiric text continues: R. Yo h anan said there were two great lights . . . and concerning both of them it says, “it was good.” And the holy One, blessed be he, took one and hid it for the righteous in the future to come, 76 as it is written, “How great is your goodness that Chapter Four 152 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 152"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"you hid for those who fear you, that you did for those who take refuge in you in the full view of men” (Ps 31:20). This teaches that no creature could contemplate [lehistakkel] the first light, as it is written, “And God saw all that he made, and behold it was very good” (Gen 1:31), it was shining and resplendent. He took [a portion] from his good light and com- prised within it thirty-two paths of wisdom, and he gave them to this world [olam ha-zeh]. Thus it is written, “For I have given you good instruction, do not forsake my Torah” (Prov 4:2), that is to say, the treasure of the Oral Torah. And the holy One, blessed be he, said: If they guard this attribute in this world, for this attribute is considered to be in the category of this world [ne h shevet bi-khelal ha-olam ha-zeh], and it is the Oral Torah, they will merit the life of the world-to-come [ yizkku le- h ayyei ha-olam ha-ba], which is the hidden good [ha- t ov ha-ganuz]. And what is it? The glory [uzzo] of the holy One, blessed be he, as it is written, “and the splendor will be like the light” [we-nogah ka-or tihyeh] (Hab 3:4). In the future, the splendor [nogah] taken from the first light will be like the light if my children ful- fill the Torah and commandment that I have given to instruct them, 77 as it is written, “My son, heed the discipline of your father and do not forsake the Torah of your mother” (Prov 1:8). It is written, “And it gives off rays on every side — there is the concealment of his glory” (Hab 3:4). What is the “concealment of his glory” [ h evyon uzzo] ? That light that he concealed and hid, as it says, “that you hid for those who fear you.” Regarding that which remained, “you did for those who take refuge in you,” in this world. They guard your Torah, fulfill your commandments, sanctify your great name, and unify it secretly and openly, as it says, “in the full view of men.” 78 The two lights correspond respectively to the third and sixth of the ten say- ings—the brilliant light of the world-to-come and the radiant splendor of this world; the treasure of wisdom, which is the quarry of Torah, and the treasure of the Oral Torah. 79 The eschatological imagery culled from rabbinic dicta is theosophically transformed in the bahiric text, or, to state it more prudently, the theosophic intent is rendered more explicit in the Bahir: The world-to-come is an epithet for the supernal light, which is the concealment of the glory, the frag- ment of light withdrawn and stored away for the righteous. From the residue of light emanates the lower light, the Shekhinah, the attribute that comprises the thirty-two paths of wisdom. To move still closer to our goal of ascertaining how the world-to-come relates to the issue of temporality we would do well to consider yet another bahiric passage: R. Berechiah sat and expounded: How is it that every day we speak of the world-to- come [olam ha-ba] , but we do not know that of which we speak? The world-to-come is translated [in Aramaic] as the world-that-is-coming [alma de-atei]. What is the world that is coming?

He said: If they are meritorious with respect to this sevenfold and they guard it, I will give them this in the other world. Thus it is written the world-to-come [olam ha-ba] , for it has already come from the six days of creation [she-kevar ba mi-sheshet yemei bere’shit] , as it is written, “How great is your goodness that you hid for those who fear you, that you did for those who take refuge in you in the full view of men” (Ps 31:20). 80 R. Berechiah seeks to penetrate the secret of the world-to-come by examin- ing the philological assonance of the expression olam ha-ba. To grasp what it con- veys we need to heed the Aramaic rendering, alma de-atei, the world-that-is- coming. In what sense is it coming? Inasmuch as it has already come (she-kevar ba) . Whence does it come? From having been. The fold of time enfolds from the diminution of light created in the beginning. God took a sevenfold of this light and “placed it for them in his place” [sam lahem bi-meqomo] ; the remainder was stored away for the righteous in the world-to-come. The sevenfold relates to the seven folds of light that proceed from the opening of the womb of the mother, the world-to-come, Binah. The location of the sevenfold is God’s “place,” that is, the last of the seven lower emanations, Shekhinah, also identified as this world [olam ha-zeh] , as God is the place of this world even though the world is not God’s place. 81 If the righteous in this world protect the sevenfold light, they merit the rest of the light, which has been hidden. The world-to-come is thus the world that has already come, that is, the light, stored away for the righteous, from the seven days of creation. The latter, as we have already seen, are semi- otic ciphers that point symbolically to the divine potencies, the ontic source of light. Threading together various textual strands from the Bahir, later kabbalists characterized Binah as the final mem that marks the end discernible in and from the middle, womb of the mother, fiftieth gate of understanding, jubilee, great Sabbath, Yom Kippur, secret of return, world-to-come that “is coming” from having “already come.” 82 In this secret of closure in the middle, suspended between the end open in the beginning and the beginning open in the end, is the extending of time to eternity in the persistence of what comes and goes, expectation of before and retention of after, the moment at hand, seemingly always beyond our grasp, the light restored as light to light whence it lingered as light. In this abiding transience is the power of forgiving, the giving before Chapter Four 154 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 154"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"there is another to receive. The mystery of forgiveness elucidates the ontologi- cal implication of repentance as the perpetual return of what has never been.

Forgiveness is thus the giving-before that grounds the fecundity of time in the ever-coming retrieval of what is to be. In the moment of forgiving, time endures, and no more turns into not yet. Only by recovering the future that withdraws as what has been can we uncover the past that remains as what is to come. 83 With this insight, recollection of the beginning of the end from the end of the beginning, we have come to the middle of the end in the end of the middle.

We arrive at the terminus delimited as the limit always yet to be delimited, the limit beyond which there is no limit, and hence the limit of what cannot be delimited. Death, Jean-Luc Marion perceptively remarked, is “a phenomenon that can be phenom- enalized only in its coming to pass, for outside of this passage it cannot properly be; it appears, then, only to the extent that it comes to pass; if it didn’t, it could never be.” 1 In the receding advance of the forward retreating, the inscripting of death’s erasure, truth is laid bare. Disclosing that erasure is a matter to be written from the evasiveness of the end that comes-to-be as the future that is always still- to-come, the time that is measured by différance, the deferral of meaning that can be apprehended only in and through the endless play of interpretation. “Time,” wrote Paul Claudel, “is the way offered to all that will be to be no longer. It is the Invitation to die, for every phrase to decompose in the explicative and total concordance, to consummate the speech of adoration addressed to the ear of the Sigè the Abyss.” 2 In its incessant passing, a necessary corollary to its interminable coming, time exemplifies something elementary about the nature of life as discerned from the (non)event of death, the “possibility of impossi- bility,” in Heidegger’s formulation. 3 Human time-keeping is indebted to death as the signpost at the beginning of the end that illumines the way back to the end that was the beginning, the gathering of what will be scattered in and from the abyss of silence resounding in the sound of silence. But how does one speak Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 156"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"of what cannot be spoken? How does one write of what comes to pass by pulling away? How does one inscribe death, crossing the line of the coming of one’s time—as in our saying “one’s time has come”—commemorating the absence of presence in the presence of absence, the sudden, unexpected, albeit altogether anticipated effacement of the face? 4 Surely, by the sign of the end must one finally be re/signed to the end of the sign. In this matter, we can find our footing in a zoharic text that correlates death and truth through the insight that tau, the last letter of the alphabet, seals both the words mawet, “death,” and emet, “truth.” 5 This mark perforce serves as a re/mark, marking again what has been marked before, the remarkable that brings to mind truth obscured in the correlation of truth and death—the truth of death invariably linked to the death of truth—not because it has been for- gotten or occluded but because it is inherently unknowable, mysterious to the core. Even the typically enigmatic Heraclitus, according to a citation of Clement of Alexandria, addressed the mysteriousness of mortality unambiguously, “What awaits men at death they do not expect or even imagine.” 6 Death’s im- penetrability, however, is not to be explained solely by appealing to its unpre- dictability. On the contrary, from another vantage point death is eminently (if not immanently) predictable, indeed, it is the most certain aspect of our finite existence, a measure of stability in a field of impermanence and fluctuation. Yet inevitable though it may be, death persists as the mystery that disrupts abruptly. The veridicality of death is inseparable from its cryptic character as an occur- rence that is technically non-sense. Death—the end that comes not at the end, for the end comes not except as the end to come, the silence that lingers between notes played in the middle—opens consciousness to the moment that escapes objectification and thematization, a moment that may be rendered poet- ically as con/frontation with the face, which is most fully visible when it can be seen no more. In this encounter, at the intersection of being and nothing, truth as the wholly other is disclosed, albeit in the concealment of its disclosure. Levinas has expressed the matter by insisting that death is an “affectivity without intentionality” that evokes a disquietude of the psyche “wherein an interrogation interrogates itself yet is not convertible to a response” other than the “responsibility of the questioning itself or of the one who questions,” 7 an “awaiting or anticipation, without any anticipating aiming; it must thus be considered as having engulfed its intentionality of awaiting, in an awaiting that is patience or pure passivity . . . a non-taking upon oneself or a non-assumption of what is equivalent to no content.” 8 The duration of time culminates in the irruption of death, the “impossible thought,” 9 “nonknowledge” (non-savoir) , “disquieting (inquiétude) of the Same by the Other, without the Same ever being able to comprehend or encompass the Other,” 10 “awakening to the unab- After Tau / Where Endings Begin 157 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 157"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"sorbable alterity of the other . . . the beyond-measure (démesure) or the infinity of the other,” 11 intimacy of the “affection of the present by the nonpresent.” 12 The apparent migration at death from being to not-being should not be understood as a transition from one state to its opposite (as the egological consciousness too often assumes) but as a suspension of the very possibility of such a transition; indeed, if death is at all phenomenally possible, it is as the possibility of the impossi- ble, which engenders in its supplemental desire—desire for the supplement— the character of pure possibility. 13 The sign at the end signifies that which (prop- erly speaking) cannot be signified, the transcendent alterity opening time to eternity, not to be rendered in the Platonic sense of an immutable realm that stands over and against the temporal, but rather in the apprehension of the eter- nality of time and the temporality of eternity, a middle way that renders the tra- ditional binary between evanescence and permanence obsolete. 14 From a semiotic perspective, the inevitability of death as the ultimate (non)event in subjectivity compels human consciousness to articulate its own limit, positing a signifier that signifies what lies beyond signification. Expanding on Kant’s notion that the sublime consists of unattainability (Unerreichbarkeit) becoming a form of presentation (Darstellung) , Thomas Weiskel remarked, “The absence of a signified itself assumes the status of a signifier, disposing us to feel that behind this newly significant absence lurks a newly discovered presence.” 15 Death may be considered the quintessentially sublime moment (if it can be des- ignated a moment at all), the signifier with no/thing to be signified. As Levinas put it, death is a “struggle between discourse and its negation . . . an ambigu- ity that perhaps indicates another dimension of meaning than that in which death is thought within the alternative to be/not to be. The ambiguity, the enigma.” 16 The mark at the end is the marking of this enigma, “to think more than one thinks, to think of what withdraws from thought,” the ambivalence that blurs the ontological division of nothingness and being, the desire for the infinite that summons the “generosity of sacrifice outside the known and the unknown, without calculation, for going on to infinity.” 17 Not to be prevails as the decisive way to be. Should we have expected otherwise? Is expectation not this very coincidence of opposites, to await the return of what has never departed? To be at the end is to live from the clarity of this obfuscation. In this part of the journey, we take our textual cue from a passage in zoharic literature, as the Bahir is decidedly silent with regard to the letter that bespeaks the silence of the end. Indeed, in the bahiric fragments that have been pre- served, there is no reference, implicit or explicit, to tau, a reticence that resonates in the saying of the unsaid, a doubling of secrecy that conceals the disclosure and thereby discloses the concealment. The relevant text is from a section of Zohar that recasts several older aggadic themes clustered about the belief that Chapter Five 158 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 158"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Torah—in her capacity as wisdom—served as God’s confidant, the (female) consort with whom he was bemused and with whom he took counsel prior to creation (images culled from Prov 8:14 and 30). Insofar as creation is viewed primarily as a linguistic act in rabbinic cosmogony, it makes perfectly good sense that Torah, which can be decomposed into the twenty-two Hebrew con- sonants, would have been depicted symbolically as God’s playmate. 18 The narrative preserved in Zohar recounts how each of the letters presents itself before God in an effort to be chosen as the primary instrument through which the world would be created. This is based on much older literary sources. Particularly relevant is the beginning of the second recension of Midrash Otiyyot de-Rabbi Aqiva: “These are the twenty-two letters through which Torah in its entirety was given to the tribes of Israel, and they were engraved by a flaming pen on the awesome and splendid crown of the holy One, blessed be he. When the holy One, blessed be he, desired to create the world, immediately all of them descended and stood before the holy One, blessed be he, and each one said before him ‘Create the world through me.’ ” 19 There is much of interest here that calls for interpretative embellishment, but we must restrain our steps and keep to the main path. Significantly, the mythic account of creation, ma‘aseh bere’shit, in Zohar begins from the end, tau, the seal of emet, truth exposed in its concealment. The zoharic version is framed in terms of R. Hamnuna the Elder’s observation that the order of alef and beit is reversed in the beginning of Torah, that is, the first two words, bere’shit bara, begin with beit and the next two, elohim et, with alef. Taking hold of the inversion of alef and beit at the incision of the inception opens the way to re/covering what has been uncovered. When the holy One, blessed be he, wanted to create the world, all the letters were hid- den. For two thousand years prior to the creation of the world, the holy One, blessed be he, was contemplating and bemusing himself with them. 20 When he desired to cre- ate the world, all the letters came before him from the end to the beginning. Initially, letter tau began to enter. It said: Master of the worlds, let it be pleasing before you to create the world through me, for I am the seal of your signet “truth” [ h otama de-gushpanqa dilakh emet], and you are called “truth.” It is appropriate for the king to begin with the letter of “truth” [ot emet] and to create the world through me. The holy One, blessed be he, said to it: You are worthy and you are commend- able, but you are not worthy enough for the world to be created through you since in the future you will be inscribed on the foreheads of faithful men who fulfilled the Torah from alef to tau and through your marking [reshimu dilakh] they will die. Moreover, you are the seal of death [ h otama de-mawet], and since this is the case, you are not worthy for the world to be created through you . Immediately, it departed. 21 After Tau / Where Endings Begin 159 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 159"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The argument placed in the mouth of tau is crafted on the basis of two older and originally discrete motifs, the depiction of emet as the signet ( h otam) of God and the identification of this word as a proper divine name. Regarding the for- mer, it is important to mention the talmudic dictum, “Reish Laqish said, ‘ Tau is the terminus of the seal of the holy One, blessed be he’ [sof h otamo shel ha-qadosh barukh hu] , for as R. H anina said, ‘The seal of the holy One, blessed be he, is truth’ [ h otamo shel ha-qadosh barukh hu emet] .” 22 With respect to the second motif, especially germane to the zoharic formulation is the beginning of another recension of Midrash Otiyyot de-Rabbi Aqiva : Rabbi said: Alef. What is alef? This teaches that the Torah said: “Truth teaches your mouth” [emet lammed pikha] so that you will merit life in this world. “Your mouth teaches truth” [pikha lammed emet] so that you will merit life of the world-to-come. 23 Why is this so? Because the holy One, blessed be he, is called “truth” [emet] ... as it says, “the Lord is truly God” [ yhwh elohim emet] (Jer 10:10). 24 Combining these two themes, the author of the zoharic account has tau plead- ing that it deserves to be the agency of creation since it is the conclusion of emet, which is both the signet of God and one of his epithets. God responds that despite these merits, tau is not worthy enough. Two reasons are given, although I think it possible to view them as two versions of one explanation. The first reason is related to the vision in Ezekiel (9:4–6) where the “men who groan and moan” because of the abominations committed against God in Jerusalem are marked on their foreheads by the “man clothed in linen with the writing case at his waist.” The individuals so inscribed are instructed by the angelic man to slay all those who are guilty. Compliant with the biblical text, the mark (tau) empowers the faithful so that they may participate in the dispen- sation of divine judgment. The second interpretation attested in Zohar, by contrast, is based on a homily transmitted in the Babylonian Talmud in the name of R. A h a ben H anina. 25 The narrative about God’s punishing the Jerusalemites in the ninth chapter of Ezekiel is presented as the sole textual source for an exception to the theological axiom that a “good measure” (middah t ovah) does not go forth from God and change into evil. According to the exegesis of R. A h a, the “man clothed in linen” refers to Gabriel, 26 who was commanded by God, “Go and mark the foreheads of the righteous with a tau of ink so that the angels of destruction will not prevail over them, and [place a] tau of blood on the foreheads of the wicked so that the angels of destruction will prevail over them.” The attribute of judgment (middat ha-din) , however, mounts a persuasive argument before God that the righteous Chapter Five 160 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 160"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"who did not try to prevent others from sinning also deserve to be put to death. This idea is supported textually by R. Joseph’s reading of u-mimmiqddashi ta h ellu, “begin at my sanctuary” (Ezek 9:6) as u-mimequddashai ta h ellu, “begin with my sanctified ones,” that is, “the people who fulfilled the Torah entirely from alef to tau, ” an opinion also transmitted in the name of R. Samuel ben Na h man. 27 The moral intent of the prophetic vision, then, is to stress that a righteous man who does not prevent others from sinning justifies the attribute of judgment’s altering of the divine will by transforming God’s good intention into evil. Before returning to the medieval kabbalistic source, we would do well to note that the singular mark of the biblical text becomes two marks in the rab- binic homily: an ink spot on the foreheads of the righteous and a bloodstain on the foreheads of the wicked, the former serving as an apotropos to deflect the angels of destruction and the latter as a lure to attract them. Three crucial points in the talmudic source may be clarified with the help of Saul Lieberman’s analy- sis. 28 First, in all probability, the exegetical decoding of tau in Ezekiel as refer- ring to the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet was enhanced by the phonetic a‹nity between tau and the Greek theta, which was used as an abbreviation for thanatos (death) in capital sentences in Gentile courts. Second, the doubling of the mark may be explained by the fact that tau was almost identical in form with chi and in sound with theta. While the latter was deployed as a mark of execu- tion, the former was a mark of the canceling of debts and, by extension, a sign of freedom from bondage. Thus, the mark of liberty was placed on the fore- heads of the righteous and the mark of death on the foreheads of the wicked. The dual function of tau is captured in a statement attributed to Rav in the same talmudic context that this letter concomitantly signals ti h yeh and tamut, “you shall live” and “you shall die.” Furthermore, the black-mark of death (nigrum theta) is depicted in the rabbinic homily as the blood-mark (tau shel dam) , which is set in contrast to the ink-mark (tau shel deyo) . This may be explained as a rejoin- der on the part of some rabbis to an exegetical tradition cultivated by early Church Fathers that connected the tau of Ezekiel with the paschal lamb, the sym- bol of salvation. This possibility is enhanced by the evidence (supplied, for example, by Origen) that Jewish Christians interpreted the tau of Ezekiel as a sign of the cross (related, as we have seen, to the shape of the letter in the ancient script) placed on the foreheads of Christians. 29 Apparently responding to this interpretation, rabbinic exegetes emphasized that the mark of blood sig- nals destruction rather than deliverance. 30 This rabbinic concern underlies the zoharic comment that the “faithful men who fulfilled the Torah from alef to tau ” would die because of the tau with which they were marked. One should note the stroke of literary ingenuity: the right- eous who fulfill the whole of Torah, from beginning to end, will be brought After Tau / Where Endings Begin 161 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 161"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"down tragically on account of the mark of the end. The metaphysical insight the medieval kabbalist elicits from the talmudic text is made explicit in the second explanation for why tau was disqualified: because it is the concluding letter of mawet, “death.” The midrashic explanation that the inscripting of tau on the heads of the righteous was a sign of their culpability suggests an intricate con- nection between this letter and death, made more overt in the observation that tau seals both emet and mawet, “truth” and “death.” By focusing on this ostensibly trivial point, the author of the zoharic text prompts us to ponder the showing of time in the concealment of truth. 31 This patently obvious observation puts into sharp relief the existential truth that time beckons in the chronic withholding of death. In death we come to know the secrecy of time in (un)knowing the time of secrecy. In this unknowing, we clasp the moment as the momentary letting- go of the moment, unassimilable in the withdrawal of its transcendence. The experience of death, if indeed we can speak of death as an experience, 32 provides us with a phenomenological model of time that is circular in its linearity: What is yet to be reverts to what has already been in the form of what is yet to be what has already been. We traverse the quadrilateral span of time in linear progres- sion, but the inescapability of our temporal demise paradoxically occasions the continual deferral of the end, which recurs precisely because it has never been. The time of our death is determined exclusively by the death of our time, but the death of our time can be ascertained only from the time of our death. Philosophically, we may educe from the zoharic text the epistemic axiom that death reveals the truthfulness of time by concealing the timeliness of truth. Something, however, remains curiously uncertain about the certainty of this truism, as one is still left to ponder why the universe could not have been cre- ated by tau. Would it have not made perfectly good sense for the temporal world to come into being through the letter that denotes concurrently the endurance of death and the ephemerality of time? Is the resoluteness of death not an appropriate determination of truth in this world? The ambiguity in the correlation of emet and mawet needs further consideration if we wish to get to the bottom of this concern. To clarify how death unveils truth even while truth remains veiled, we would do well to revisit the image of truth as the signet of God, particularly as it appears in the talmudic passage briefly discussed in the preface. Careful exami- nation of this passage will position us to understand better the juxtaposition of truth and death in kabbalistic lore, which in turn will allow us to grasp time as the linear circularity of the middle extending to the beginning that returns to the end. It is this ontological conception of temporality that informed the hermeneutical perspective of kabbalists as readers of Scripture, mystically identified as the textual body of YHWH, the most sacred of divine names.

Judah ben Pazi said: Even the holy One, blessed be he, does not judge alone as it says, “all the hosts of heaven stood upon him from his right and from his left” (1 Kgs 22:19), those who advocate and those who condemn. Although he does not judge alone, the seal [ h otam] is singular, as it says, “I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth” (Dan 10:21). R. Yo h anan said: The holy One, blessed be he, never does something in his world until he takes counsel with the court above. What is the reason? “The word was true in a great multitude” (ibid., 10:1). When is the seal of the holy One, blessed be he, true? When he takes counsel with the court above. R. Eleazar said: In every place that it says “the Lord,” 34 it refers to him and to his court. The principle for all of them is “And the Lord spoke evil about him” (1 Kgs 22:23). What is the seal of the holy One, blessed be he? R. Bebai in the name of R. Reuben said: Truth [emet]. What is truth? R. Bun said: “[The Lord is truly God] he is the living God and everlasting king” (Jer 10:10). Reish Laqish said: Alef — the beginning of the alphabet, mem in the middle, and tau in the end, to indicate that “I, the Lord, am first” (Isa 41:4), for I did not receive from another. “And there is no god but me” (ibid., 44:6), for I have no partner. “And of the last ones, I am he” (ibid., 41:4), for in the future I will not hand it over to another. 35 The mythical image of God’s seal appears in the talmudic explication of the judicial maxim that one should not judge alone, for only the divine judge can adjudicate on his own. According to the opinion attributed to R. Judah ben Pazi, however, even God does not render judgment without consulting the heavenly court. God’s autonomy is nonetheless upheld by the claim that there is only one seal ( h otam) of judgment, that is, it may be necessary for God to consult with others in rendering judgment, but he alone bears responsibility for the judg- ment that is eventually rendered. This idea is supported textually by the image of the “book of truth” (ketav emet) drawn from the apocalyptic vision of Daniel, an image that conveys the quality of truth as durable or steadfast, for what is inscribed in a book was thought even from antiquity to stand the test of time. 36 As another rabbinic aphorism states, “Truth stands, deceit does not stand” (qush t a qa’ei shiqra lo qa’ei) . 37 The correlation between the seal and truth is even more pronounced in the tradition that the seal of God is truth. Two explanations are offered to explain the nature of this truth. In the opinion of R. Bun, emet is the seal of God, for it is one of the terms by which God is named (as in Jer 10:10); in the opinion of After Tau / Where Endings Begin 163 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 163"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Reish Laqish, emet is the seal because it comprises the first, middle, and final con- sonants of the Hebrew alphabet— alef reishei de-alfa beita mem ba-em s a‘itah tau be- sofah. The consonants, in turn, are assigned temporal significance: alef is aligned with the past, mem with the present, and tau with the future. Theological mean- ing is attributed to the three consonants as well, for they signify the uniqueness of God in the three temporal modes: alef intimates that YHWH was alone at the beginning, mem that he has no partner now, and tau that in the future there will be no other god. The view of Reish Laqish is linked exegetically to two verses from Deutero-Isaiah, “Who has wrought and created, calling the generations from the beginning; I, the Lord, am first, and of the last ones, I am he” (Isa 41:4) and “Thus says the Lord, king of Israel, and his redeemer, Lord of hosts, I am first and I am last, and besides me there is no god” (ibid., 44:6). It is pos- sible that the version of the dictum of Reish Laqish preserved here is accurate and we should not be surprised at the combination of disparate verses, a well- attested phenomenon in rabbinic literature easily explained by the fact that the sages typically cited biblical texts from memory. There is, however, a gnawing sense that in this case something is amiss. Interestingly, an alternative version is found in Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah, a collection of midrashic dicta organized around the verses of the Song. From the standpoint of redactional history this version is later than the one in the Palestinian Talmud, but from the perspective of tex- tual transmission, it is, in my view, earlier and superior. Reish Laqish said: Why is it emet? Alef is at the beginning of the letters [ be-ro’sh ha- otiyyot] , mem in the middle [ be-em s a] , and tau in their end [ be-sofan] , to indicate that “I am first and I am last, and besides me there is no god” (Isa 44:6). “I am first,” for I have not received my dominion [malkhuti] from another, “and I am last,” for I will not hand it over to another one who is not in the world, “and besides me there is no god,” for he has no second. 38 This version of Reish Laqish’s teaching brings into even clearer focus that the letters of emet attest to the singularity of God’s being in the beginning, middle, and end. The philosophical maxim is elucidated by images extracted exegeti- cally from the prophetic utterance. Hence, “I am first” indicates that, in the beginning of creation, God did not receive his dominion (malkhut) from another; “I am last” shows that in the end, at the appointed time, there is no other to whom the dominion will be transferred; and the continuation of the verse, “and besides me there is no god,” signals the triumph of monotheistic faith in the present historical epoch. The interpretation transmitted in the name of Reish Laqish possibly encodes a response on the part of some rabbis to the emerging Christian belief in the Chapter Five 164 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 164"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"divine nature of Jesus, expressed as both his demiurgic collaboration in the beginning and his messianic dominion at the end. 39 Especially relevant is the revelation of Jesus concerning what will come to pass “soon,” as bequeathed to John through an angel. Jesus is described in that revelation as the “firstborn of the dead and the ruler of kings on earth” (Rev 1:5), the one who has “freed” human beings from their sin “by his blood” (ibid., 6) and thereby transformed believers into a “kingdom of priests” (a locution based on Exod 19:6) to whom belong the “dominion and glory” everlastingly (Rev 1:6). The surmise that Reish Laqish’s statement is responding to the Christological doctrine is substan- tiated by the celebrated poetic flourish that ends the opening prayer of John’s apocalypse: “ ‘I am the Alpha and the Omega,’ says the Lord God, ‘who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty’ ” (ibid., 8). 40 This utterance is very likely based on God’s proclamation “I am the first and I am the last” (ani ri’shon wa-ani a h aron) in Deutero-Isaiah (44:6). 41 In the New Testament context, the temporal classification is expressed linguistically, and thus the beginning and end are termed alpha and omega respectively. The additional description, “who is and was and is to come,” suggests that the present is to be added to past and future. Even though there is no mention of a letter that corresponds to the pres- ent, we may surmise that preserved here is an older, Jewish mythologoumenon that viewed the beginning, middle, and end of the alphabet as the semiotic markers signifying the triune manifestation of divine temporality. 42 The midrashic text’s exegetical framework may highlight another dimension of the ancient tradition: that the trinitarian nature of time is ontologically grounded in the truthfulness of God’s seal, YHWH, the ineffable name that in- tones that God was, is, and shall be. 43 The possibility of such an interpretation is enhanced by Isaac ben Jacob Joseph Halevi in his commentary Hadrat Qodesh on the words emet h otamo, “truth is his seal,” in the liturgical poem we-amkha telu’im bi-teshuvah, which is included in the traditional prayerbook (ma h zor) for Rosh ha- Shanah: “ Alef is the first of the letters of the alphabet, mem in the middle, and tau at the end, to indicate that he was, is, and will be.” 44 By heeding the philo- sophical understanding of the name we gain insight into the nature of time, that is, the connection established between the name and God’s being in the past, present, and future indicates that temporality is an expression of the eternality of the divine essence. A similar point may be elicited from a statement attributed to R. Isaac (briefly discussed in chapter 2) explaining the threefold repetition of the name ehyeh in Exodus 3:14: “The holy One, blessed be he, said to Moses: Say to them I am he [ani hu] , I am the one who was, I am the one now, and I am the one in the future.” 45 It has been suggested that this dictum may be a tacit reac- tion to the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. 46 The polemical aspect seems plau- sible enough, but what is important to emphasize for our purposes is the con- After Tau / Where Endings Begin 165 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 165"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"ceptual link, implicit in the rabbinic text, between the manifestation of God in time and the name, which is etymologically derived from hwh, the Semitic root that discloses being in its multiple veils. This nexus is fundamental to the kabbalistic understanding of time as the measure of the immeasurable. 47 Surely, medieval kabbalists were cognizant of the more conventional understanding promulgated by the rabbinic elites of their time: that the Tetragrammaton, depicted since the formative rabbinic period as the ineffable name (shem ha-meforash) , signifies the being that cannot be signified. Kabbalists, too, embraced the explication of YHWH as denoting that God was, is, and shall be. The threefold unity with regard to God’s way of being suggests that he is not subject to the contingencies of time, that he persists eter- nally through the flux of time from beginning to end. Eternity, however, is not the absence of time, which would be implied by a conception of timelessness, but rather the full presence of time in the compresence of past, present, and future in the moment at hand. Thus we can speak of divine temporality in an apposite sense: the divine is surreptitiously revealed in the guise of temporality; what is temporal comports itself as a veiled manifestation of divinity. To employ the insight of the phenomenology of internal time-consciousness, which I dis- cussed at length in chapter 1: In the stream of time, the flow of consciousness, what endures is change, and hence only what is old can be new. In not being, time becomes eternally, in the interval of the swerve, the pulsation of the moment, returning as never having been. The narration of time’s becoming, which inverts the causal sequence such that past is foreseen in the future and future recollected in the past, translates the eternal temporality of transcendence into the temporal eternality of immanence. At this juncture, we again turn to Heidegger to find a suitable way to express an idea elicited from kabbalistic sources. In one context, Heidegger describes the juxtaposition of time (zeit) , eternity (ewigkeit) , and the moment (augenblick) in the following way: “The eternal is not what ceaselessly lasts, but rather that which can withdraw in the moment, in order to return once again. That which can return, not as the same but as what transforms unto the new, the one-only, be-ing, such that in this manifestness it is at first not recognized as the same.” 48 What per- sists in time is what is withdrawn, for in being withdrawn it can return, in the moment— augen-blick, literally, the glance of the eye—through which one be- holds the totality of the fragmented whole. 49 Heidegger’s thinking on this mat- ter is indebted to Husserl’s Zeitbewusstsein, which, as we recall, presumes not only that consciousness is always of the present, but that in the present consciousness is the confluence of past and future, an ever-expanding chain of retentional and protentional intentionality. Thinking within the same tradition, Merleau-Ponty wrote, “Time must be understood as a system that embraces everything — Chapter Five 166 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 166"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Although it is graspable only for him who is there, is at a present.” 50 In a moment’s blink, all is (un)seen, presence-effacing-absence-etching-presence. Time is not to be conceptualized, accordingly, as a sequence of uniform moments held together in the imagination as backward and forward extensions. A proper understanding of the structure of temporal intentionality yields the insight that retentions of the past, impressions of the present, and expectations of the future are interwoven in the garment of time. Such a transcendental char- acter of the experience of time signals that human temporality is determined by the indeterminacy of the coming-to-be of what-has-been in the passing-away of what will be. From this perspective we can invert the commonsense under- standing of time and speak meaningfully of expecting the past by remembering the future. The conception of time’s linearity, buttressed by the vulgar or com- monsense experience of coming into and departing from the world at particu- lar temporal junctures as well as by the historicist predilection to interpret the past from the prejudices and idiosyncrasies of any given moment, is challenged by the disruptive effect of the ecstatic unity of temporality. In this state, the “future is not later than the having-been, and the having-been is not earlier than the present. Temporality temporalizes itself as a future that makes present, in the process of having-been.” 51 In my judgment, the explication of YHWH in ontological terms of temporal comportment, that is, referring to the name as the sign that points to the being who was, is, and shall be, is well served by an analysis in terms of the phe- nomenology of internal time-consciousness expounded in the particularly Heideggerian sense I have outlined. 52 To accept, or at the very least to make sense of, this claim, two other presumptions about kabbalistic ontology must be made explicit. First, the nature of being cannot be separated from conscious- ness; indeed, kabbalists have insisted repeatedly that one being, portrayed as infinite light, ineffable name, and limitless thought, permeates all beings. In the splintering of light through the cloud of darkness, the articulation of the name through the tremor of silence, and the infringement of thought through the shroud of ignorance, one may fathom the measure of time’s flowing. The second, not unrelated, point is that medieval kabbalists did not unequiv- ocally embrace the substantialist ontology articulated in the philosophical dis- course of their day, which was based, to a great extent, on a synthesis of Aristotelian hylomorphism and Neoplatonic emanationism. From the kabbal- ists’ vantage point, in the Godhead, being and not-being, yesh and ayin, are not to be construed as logical antinomies but rather as polar opposites identical in virtue of being different. One of the most poignant articulations of this coinci- dence was offered by Azriel of Gerona in response to a hypothetical philosoph- ical query regarding the possibility of creatio ex nihilo: “The One who brings forth After Tau / Where Endings Begin 167 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 167"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"something out of nothing is not depleted, for the something is in the nothing in the manner of the nothing, and the nothing is in the something in the man- ner of the something.” 53 In my judgment, the coincidentia oppositorum formulated by Azriel expresses an axiom a‹rmed or assumed by kabbalists without excep- tion through the centuries: something and nothing within God are identified in the place of the conjunction of their difference. To take seriously the claim that God is indivisible and indifferent, something and nothing must be identical in the (non)being of the infinite, but such a stance underscores the extent to which medieval kabbalah problematizes the discourse of its own ontological presuppositions, resisting the dissolution of something into nothing or the reification of nothing into something. A logical consequence of the assumption that every mode of being attributed to God is not-being (since being and not-being are not distinguishable in the infinite) is that every a‹rmation is a negation, every disclosure a concealment. In the sixteenth century, Solomon Alkabetz coined the expression sod ha- hithappekhut, the “secret of inversion,” to name the dialectic long presumed true by kabbalists: ha-he‘elem hu gilluy we-ha-gilluy hu he‘elem, “concealment is disclosure and disclosure concealment.” 54 To speak of God’s being is to a‹rm that the being of whom we speak is precisely not in the manner we say it is to be. Alternatively, the obfuscation of the ontological difference between being and non-being can be expressed as the impossibility of separating the apophatic and kataphatic perspectives: not to speak and to speak are one verbal (non)gesture. Levinas depicted death in precisely these terms, though ostensibly without ontological referent. From my perspective we may lay aside this distinction, for what is crucial is the illumination of the kabbalistic symbolism by our staying attuned to the indecipherable quality of death as the confounding of the dis- tinction between being and not-being. Tau, the seal of truth, is concomitantly the mark of life and the mark of death—in the words of Rav, tau ti h yeh tau tamut. The luminosity of death darkens the division that stands in the beginning and end of the ontic circuit, determining our way of being-in-the-middle. With this insight we may return to the zoharic narrative that set us on our way in this chapter. On the face of it, tau is not worthy to be the instrument of creation because its negative association with mawet cancels out the positive value assigned to it on account of its role in the formation of emet. It would seem, then, that the deleterious ramifications of death outweigh the beneficial consequences of truth. Reflecting, however, on the correlation of death and truth as they relate to the seal of divine judgment raises a question as to why these two are set in diametric opposition; on the contrary, there is no apparent justification for separating truth and death, as divine judgment may deem death Chapter Five 168 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 168"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"the most appropriate implementation of truth. What, then, can we learn from the severance of truth and death foisted upon us by the zoharic text? Perhaps the deeper significance of the disqualification of tau is the admission that there can be no semblance of natural order without supposition of the ontological difference that death renders problematic. The identity of being and not-being is possible, indeed necessary, in the realm of non-differentiation, the sphere of divine unity, which is accessible through contemplative exercises, but it is not readily applicable to the created world of separation; in the mun- dane cosmos of temporal-spatial phenomenality, the coincidence of opposites is distressing, destabilizing, disorienting. The confluence of death and not-being in the space of world-time is thus to be distinguished from the same nexus in the timespace of the world of emanations, manifest in veils of disclosure, the inversion of which I have already (mis)spoken. The root of endless time implanted in Ein Sof, like the description of Chronos as Ageless Time in Orphic theogony, 55 is the principle of unity that transcends all contraries, including the contrary between life and death. Another dimension of the symbolism of tau needs mention too, as it will instruct us about the character of truth revealed in the concealment pertinent to the end time. As noted above, the rabbinic refracting of the prophetic image yields a doubling of tau as the mark of ink and the mark of blood, the sign of life and the sign of death. The esoteric implication of this aggadic motif is not revealed in the narrative embedded in the zoharic text. Fortunately, we have a source close in time to the production of zoharic literature that may contribute to our understanding of this mystical doctrine as promulgated in the tightly knit circle of Castilian kabbalists responsible for the literary fabrication of Zohar . I refer to the commentary on the talmudic aggadah by T odros ben Joseph ha-Levi Abulafia. 56 The opening line of Abulafia’s remarks on the relevant passage from the Babylonian Talmud bodes an auspicious beginning as he reminds the reader that in the words of the rabbis there are “several deep secrets, several hidden mys- teries, and several hidden matters.” The secret, we soon learn, concerns the emanation of judgment from the left that parallels the emanation of mercy from the right. In Abulafia’s time, this idea was treated as one of the most rec- ondite components of the tradition and revealed to only a handful of initiates, who used this teaching to delve deeply into the truth of the divine nature. 57 Abulafia links this mystery to the aggadic distinction between the tau of life and the tau of death. In this connection, he quotes two passages from the Bahir, one depicting God (on the basis of Job 25:2) as making peace between Michael on the right and Gabriel on the left, 58 the other describing Satan as the evil power After Tau / Where Endings Begin 169 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 169"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"on the north side of the divine (related exegetically to Jer 1:14), a force that assumes the shape of a hand and is identified as chaos, tohu, the matter that con- founds people until they sin. 59 After citing the latter text, Abulafia comments: What they said concerning the seal of the holy One, blessed be he, being truth, this is “truth and peace you must love” (Zech 8:18), 60 and tau alludes to the name of the splendor [le-shem tif’arto] of the holy One, blessed be he, 61 for everything is beneath the dominion of the blessed One, and this is [the meaning of ] tau — you shall live [ti h yeh] , tau — you shall be graced [ta h un] , tau — you shall die [tamut] , this is the one that was changed into evil. 62 The tau, according to Abulafia, symbolizes Tif’eret, the attribute positioned in the center between left and right, which is also designated as “truth” and “peace”. The theosophic interpretation of the rabbinic dictum thus imparts to us a depiction of truth as the synthesis of opposites, a balance struck between the extremes of judgment and mercy, an interplay of withholding and overflowing. This accounts for the kabbalist’s adding the word ta h un to the tal- mudic pair ti h yeh and tamut. In contrast to the destabilization of the distinction between being and non-being brought to the fore by the inscrutable nature of death, the identification of the seal with the attribute of Tif’eret overcomes the polarization of good and evil by the constitution of truth as mediating between the two ends of the spectrum. As Azriel of Gerona put it in his commentary on the liturgical expression “for your holy name in truth is pronounced upon us” [ki shem qodshekha be-emet niqra aleinu] : “through the power of his truth, which dis- seminates in mercy [ra h amim] and judgment [din] , for the one corresponds to the other.” 63 The term shalom, “peace” or “wholeness,” is ascribed to the attribute also associated with truth, for truthfulness expresses the equilibrium that ensues from the synchronization of judgment and mercy. Abulafia elucidates the point by citing another bahiric passage, one that sets out to explain the symbolic intent of the blue thread (tekhelet) used in the tradi- tional fringe garment, as well as the reason why there are thirty-two threads. 64 The matter is clarified by a parable: a king appoints a guardian (shomer) to watch over his garden, which contains thirty-two paths. The guardian in turn appoints a guardian for each of the paths. The thirty-two threads symbolize these guardians. The blue thread is the sign (siman) that removes all doubt that the gar- den belongs the king. But there are two signs (shenei simanim) to be accounted for, inasmuch as the fringe garment itself is a sign. The two signs, the fringe gar- ment and the blue thread, are troped respectively as a sign of the garden and a sign of the thirty-two paths. The doubling of the sign is reinforced by yet another parabolic image of the king and the princess possessing individual signs Chapter Five 170 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 170"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"that they hand over to their servants to protect them. The apotropaic function of the double sign is connected exegetically to the repetition of the word “guard” (shamar) in the verse “The Lord shall guard you from all evil, he will guard your soul” (Ps. 121:7). The truthfulness of God’s seal is displayed in the duplication of tau, the mark of ink and the mark of blood, a graphic inscripting of the kabbalistic doctrine of the competing forces of holiness and impurity, ten emanations on the right and ten emanations on the left. Abulafia thus concludes his exposition with the admonition: Know that the knowledge of the emanation of the left side is a deep knowledge hidden from the eyes of the great kabbalists who received the true tradition in the secrets of Torah and the order of the emanation of the right side to the point that most of them do not pay attention to this . . . but a few of them who go more deeply have inquired, investigated, and expounded well . . . until the correct order arose in their hands with respect to that which emanates from the emanator, level after level, gradation after gradation. . . . Know that just as there are ten fingers in man from the right side to accomplish through them his will, so there are ten fingers from the left side, these accomplish the labor entrusted to them and those the labor entrusted to them. Analogously, just as there are ten holy aspects from the right side, so there are ten aspects from the left side, 65 from the ones emanate sev- eral worlds and from the others emanate several worlds, but there is a difference in their existence and subsistence, to which I do not have permission to allude. 66 Abulafia’s remark brings to light another essential component of the nexus of truth and death, which has paved our path in the middle from beginning to end. The play of energy in the world of bounded space and measured time requires binary structures—shadow and light, left and right, male and female, good and evil, judgment and mercy, pure and impure. But in the realm of divine unity—the world of unbounded space and immeasurable time, not to speak of the unspeakable beyond the pleroma—the poetic balance is such that, at root, shadow is light, left is right, male is female, good is evil, judgment is mercy, and pure is impure. For many kabbalists, according to Abulafia’s testi- mony, not to mention non-enlightened Jews, truth is predicated on a discrim- ination between opposites that preserves their antinomical difference. The phe- nomenon of time is an illustration of this larger point. As Ralph Waldo Emerson aptly put it, “The wings of Time are black and white, / Pied with morning and with night.” 67 For select initiates, however, enlightenment consists of discern- ing the divine unity in the alchemical identification of dual forces as the same through their difference. 68 In this light, the wings of time would no longer After Tau / Where Endings Begin 171 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 171"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"appear as black and white; indeed, in the state of ontological indifference, one can no longer discriminate between black and white, morning and night. Support for this interpretation is found in the following passage from a frag- ment of a work by Moses de León, one of the Castilian kabbalists responsible for the composition and dissemination of textual units that were eventually woven into the fabric of Sefer ha-Zohar: Know that the secret of the attribute of truth [sod middat emet] is the one that incites and overflows to the place of death [meqom ha-mawet] , for life motivates death. Indeed, the attribute of truth is the justice that overflows and emanates blessing upon the bundle of souls. The one who performs an act of kindness with the deceased disseminates blessing and emanates the e›ux from the place of truth to the place of death, that is, he arouses the attribute of truth in relation to the attribute of death. . . . Thus I will alert you concerning a matter of the great and deep secret . . . and it is the matter of the attribute of truth, which is the compre- hensive attribute [ ha-middah ha-kelulah] ... it holds on above and below, indeed it holds on to the four corners of the world. The matter is in the secret of its letters: Know that the secret of alef is that it is the letter that comprises all the levels and the secret of all the gradations are contained within it. On account of this it was placed as the first [ro’sh] of [the letters of ] Torah, and you already know that Torah is the attribute of truth. Thus truth [emet] comprises all the letters of Torah and since this attribute is Torah it is called emet. Emet — beginning, end, and middle, for you find that alef is the first of all letters, tau the last of all letters, and mem the middle of all letters. Thus the totality of Torah is the secret of the letters emet. As we have said, the secret of alef is the matter of Torah, and it is the containment of everything [kelal ha-kol] , and since it is life [ h ayyim] there is joined to it death [ ha-mawet] so that it would be within it. Thus you will find [in the word emet ] alef met [mem and taw] , so that [death] would be contained within it inasmuch as the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil were contained one within the other, and thus this is the secret of emet, all together as one. To return to what we were dis- cussing: when someone passes away and is depleted of life, the one who acts chari- tably with the deceased causes the alef, which is the secret of life, to overflow to the attribute of death, so that [the letters] met will be comprised in [the letter] alef, and he causes the completion of the attribute [tashlum ha-middah] to be emet, everything in one union [ ha-kol be- h ibbur e h ad] . 69 Demonstrating his ability to present a complex philosophic theme in rela- tively simple terms, Moses de León sets out in the above passage to a‹rm the intricate relationship between truth and death. To apprehend the kabbalistic intent of de León’s comments, one must bear in mind that the “attribute of truth,” associated with the letter alef, Torah, and the Tree of Life, is the emana- Chapter Five 172 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 172"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"tion of Tif’eret, 70 and the “place of death,” which is the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, is Malkhut. 71 Encoded in the word emet is the mystery of the sacred union of masculine and feminine, 72 the merging of alef and the letters mem and tau, which spell met, 73 and thus truth is called the “completion of the attribute,” for life and death are in “one union.” This is the esoteric import of the rabbinic tradition that the act of true mercy ( h esed shel emet) involves attend- ing to the needs of the deceased. 74 This designation, which on a basic level intones that there is no expectation of recompense in such a case, portends in a deeper sense that, through such an act, truth infuses death with life to the point that the one is comprised in the other (lihyot met kalul be-alef) , just as the two trees were intertwined in the garden of Eden or, invoking another symbolic idiom, utilized by de León at the conclusion of this passage, just as the Oral Torah is contained in the Written Torah. 75 The nexus of death and truth—the truth of death in the death of truth as an element opposing untruth—points to the mystical enlightenment that discerns that death is contained in life, that the demonic is in the divine. Interestingly, one zoharic passage, concerning the secret of the catharsis of evil from God, and classified in the printed versions as part of the Tosefta section, presents the con- tainment of darkness in light—and the eventual separation of these two forces as a consequence of the transition from concealment to disclosure—in densely mythical images: The vapor of the pure vapor ascends above until the place of the house of dwelling is not found, the place that is no place is not found above or below, it is removed from everything, it is destroyed from everything. Destruction [avaddon] is the male, Samael, who emerges from the dross of the strength of Isaac, and death [mawet] is his female, primordial serpent, woman of harlotry, as it is written, “her feet descend to death” (Prov 5:5). And these two, destruction and death, heard the strength of the will of the king, the secret, supernal hidden mystery, concealed from everything, hidden from ideas and thoughts. The one who is drawn after these is led astray from everything, for everything is its opposite. Praiseworthy is the perfect man like Jacob who ascends and whose eyes are not darkened by this smoke and he merited to draw close to truth, the seal of the holy king. 76 The continuation of the text describes the emanation of the sefirot as they relate to the letters of the Tetragrammaton. The holy powers emerge only after the purging of the impure forces from the divine, a theme that evolved into one of the cardinal tenets of sixteenth-century Lurianic kabbalah. Important for our purposes here is the reference to the two forces of evil, masculine Samael and feminine serpent, respectively (on the basis of Job 28:22) as “destruction” and After Tau / Where Endings Begin 173 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 173"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"“death.” The demonic potencies occupy the place of utter destitution, the “place that is no place” (atar law atar) , which is found neither above or below. Significantly, this gnosis, exemplified by Jacob, is presented as a way of coming to know the seal of God, which is truth. One must be wary of being drawn to these potencies, since they may lure one into implementing the destabilizing wisdom that everything is its opposite, that truth is deception, that good is evil, that holiness is sin. Yet it is precisely this insight that is at the heart of the mys- tical vision, the apprehension of the secret of faith, the a‹rmation of the iden- tically different in the oneness of what is differently identical. This is the moment of which I spoke in chapter 2, the moment that affords one the oppor- tunity to see with two eyes, one eye seeing unity and the other duality, though there must be a third eye to which the one and the other are the same differ- ence, differently the same. 77 This is expressed in the following zoharic passage in terms of the ostensible contrast between Lilith and Shekhinah: Come and see what is written: “Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold of Sheol” (Prov 5:5). And what is written concerning the mystery of faith? “Her ways are pleasant ways, all her paths, peaceful” (ibid., 3:17). These are the ways and paths of Torah. All is one, this is peace and that is death, each the opposite of the other. 78 This passage sheds further light on a crucial aspect of the nexus between truth and death that we discerned in Abulafia’s commentary. To know truth in the fullest disclosure, one must plumb the depths of deceit portrayed in images of desolation. 79 This gnosis, which, as Abulafia and other kabbalists in late-thir- teenth-century Castile emphasized, is limited to a small number of adepts, guides one on the path to discerning the obliteration of the dichotomy between the divine and the demonic in the Godhead. Dwelling on the identity of differ- ence implied thereby might prove especially dangerous, as one could easily be led astray by the recognition that everything is its opposite, and life itself would be experienced most fully as death, abiding in the annihilation of abiding, but still more in the annihilation of annihilation. 80 The mark of the end signals a return to this beginning, not as the restoration of all things to a timeless source of time, the now of eternity that encompasses the fullness of time, but the splintering of jouissance into the threefold craving that compulsively yields the will to give birth to oneself as the other, to become what one has everlastingly not been, the beginning marked by the deadly truth of the truth of death.

Heraclitus The precise turn of thought charted in this book opens the possibility of a tem- poral triumph of temporality, the conquering of time through time. 1 In an effort to pave the way to this possibility, I have explored the nexus of time, truth, and death as it emerges hermeneutically from the symbolic world of medieval kab- balah. I have not adhered to the familiar methodology adopted by scholars of Jewish mysticism, focusing on a particular historical period or individual per- sonality; I have organized my thoughts instead around the letters alef, mem, and tau, the consonants of the word emet, “truth,” which stand respectively for begin- ning, middle, and end, the three points of the curvature of the timeline. Utilizing profound—I am tempted to say abysmal—imaginative rumina- tions on time elicited from kabbalistic sources, I have sought to articulate an ontology of time that is a grammar of becoming. The correlation of truth and divinity underscores that truth, which embodies in its semiotic constellation the triadic structure of temporality, is the mark of the divine eternally becoming in time—a formulation that is still too dichotomous, as the divine becoming is not an event in time but the eventuality of time, an eventuality instantiated in the momentous eruption of the moment wherein life and death converge in the coming to be of that which endures everlastingly and the endurance of that which comes to be provisionally. By heeding the letters of emet we have come to discern something of the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration 175 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 175"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Conclusion 176 of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of (re)birth, the closure that opens the opening that closes. Here, at the end, we would do well to recall a powerfully poetic account of eternity’s conquest of time offered by Rosenzweig 2 in the concluding section of Der Stern der Erlösung: To live in time means to live between beginning and end. He who would live an eternal life, and not the temporal in time, must live outside of time, and he who would do this must deny that “between.” But such a denial would have to be active if it is to result, not just in a not-living-in-time but in a positive living eternally! And the active denial would occur only in the inversion. To invert a Between means to make its After a Before, its Before an After, the end a beginning, the beginning an end. And that is what the eternal people does. It already lives its own life as if it were all the world and the world were finished. In its Sabbaths it celebrates the sabbatical completion of the world and makes it the foundation and starting point of its existence. But that which temporally speaking, would be but starting point, the law, that it sets up as its goal. Thus it experiences no Between for all that it naturally, really naturally, lives within it. Rather it experiences the inversion of the Between. Thus it denies the omnipotence of the Between and disavows time, the very time which is experienced on the eternal way. 3 In this passage, Rosenzweig articulates his celebrated theological notion of the metahistorical destiny of Judaism set in contrast to the historical fate of Christianity, eternal life’s surmounting of the eternal way. 4 For the one who lives beyond history, the beginning is the end, the end the beginning. The sur- passing of time is experienced in the fullness of time, the spontaneous recur- rence of what has never been—only that which has never been can recur—in the instant that has no before or after. 5 Linear time is eternalized in the circular rhythms of the sacred time of liturgy and ritual, a process exemplified especially in the celebration of Sabbath. 6 The Jewish Sabbath instantiates the coalescence of past, present, and future, the temporal correlates of the theological cate- gories of creation, revelation, and redemption. In the life of the Jew, who lives in and from the end, time has been proleptically redeemed and the experience of the between fulfilled. The disavowal of time does not imply an abrogation or even a dialectical surpassing of temporality, but rather its radical deepening, an eradication of time by rooting oneself more deeply in the ground of time. Eternity, accordingly, is not the metaphysical overcoming of or existential escape from time but rather the merging of the three-dimensional structure of Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 176"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"lived temporality through eternalization of the present in the continuous becoming of the being that has always been what is yet to come. 7 Without denying the profundity of Rosenzweig’s thinking about time, I would argue that the kabbalistic tradition, building on themes and subtleties of thought evident in older sources, fosters an understanding of the radical becom- ing of time-being in its being-time, an interruptive narration that militates against the feasibility of constructing a contemporaneous myth in which past, present, and future converge in an absolute that is all-in-all. Fundamentally, Rosenzweig would have concurred with the insight of Kierkegaard: “Like free- dom, truth is the eternal. If the eternal is not, there is neither truth nor free- dom.” 8 By contrast, the correlation of time and truth I have elicited from the Jewish esoteric tradition presumes a rupture in being’s center, a tear that opens the prospect of retrieval, restoration, return to a world that is eternally coming from the origin secreted in the terminus of its exposé. 9 “The Visions of Eternity,” wrote Blake in the second chapter of his epic Jerusalem, “by reason of narrowed perceptions, / Are become weak visions of Time & Space, fix’d into furrows of death; / Till deep dissimulation is the only defence an honest man has left.” 10 In the furrow of death—the crevice of being, to borrow the poeti- cizing language of Benjamin—is the “center of the interval,” the “womb of time, whence the self radiates outward,” the “countermovement of things in the time of the self.” 11 The time of death bespeaks not the death of time, but time (im)mortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken—between, before, beyond.

The posi- tion embraced by Augustine is predicated on the interplay of knowledge and faith, which occasions the paradoxical identification of opposites such that seek- ing is itself attainment and attainment seeking. When translated into temporal terms, the end of the quest can never be separated from the beginning nor the beginning from the end. See Augustine, On the Trinity: Books 8–15, p. 24: “For the safest purpose for him who seeks is to continue seeking until he has laid hold of that towards which we tend and for which we are striving. . . .

By contrast, in the second hypothesis, Par- menides 151e–155d, Plato analyzes the theorems and corollaries that support the view that the One does participate in time and hence may be considered a tensed being. The paradoxical conclusion, which challenges the principle of noncontradiction, is stated explicitly in the third deduction of the first hypoth- esis (155e–156a): Concerning the One, we must say that it is both one and many, neither one nor many, participates in being and does not participate in being, and, consequently, participates and does not participate in time.

The spatial conception of time has been more recently a‹rmed in contemporary philo- sophical accounts such as Quentin Smith’s presentism, the view that the pres- ent is the “universal subject” of all propositions and the “metaphysical subject” of every state of affairs. See Nerlich, “Time as Spacetime,” pp. 119–134. 68. Bergson, Creative Mind, p. 176; idem, Time and Free Will, 124 – 139; Mullarkey, Bergson, 150–155.

It is of interest to note, finally, the view expressed by Deleuze, Nego- tiations, pp. 55–56, that the nexus between the concepts of temporality, the whole, and openness in Bergson’s thought is best captured in the time-image of cinema crafted in the three cinematographic processes, framing, cutting, and the production of the montage. 69.

By referring to the ego-self in Husserl’s thought I do not mean to deny that he was critical of positing an independent substantial ego that endures through time. On the contrary, a crucial aspect of his phenomenology was aimed at describing experiences without presuming an empirical bearer in the form of an abiding ego. As Sartre, influenced by Husserl, was later to make clear, the presumption of an ego is not necessary since consciousness unifies Notes to Pages 11 – 12 184 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 184"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"itself through the stream of temporalization. See Zahavi, “Three Concepts,” pp. 52 – 55. The nonegological stance notwithstanding, it is still the case that Husserl posits an ego as a product of a reflective operation, the introspective self-awareness, which, it seems to me, betrays the double movement of the sub- ject constituting and being constituted in the course of time. 73.

For further elaboration of this point, see Keller, Kant, pp. 113–140. 125. Note that even in quantum physics the determination of spacetime inter- vals depends on transforming units of time into units of space by taking the time difference between the point of origin and point of destiny and multiply- ing it by the speed of light. Time, then, is not simply the fourth dimension of space, nor is it evidently clear how time emerges continuously from a dimen- sion of space according to the big bang theory of Hartley-Hawking.

Even the present-past-future form of objective time has its basis here. It is built up from inner time through objective constitution.” In this matter, it seems to me, Husserl anticipated Merleau-Ponty’s emphasis on the reversibility of time and the understanding of temporality as diacritical difference as opposed to triadic sequentiality, which, ironically enough, is framed as a cri- Notes to Pages 23 – 26 189 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 189"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"tique of Husserl.

The point is expressed as well by Mensch, Postfoundational Phenomenology, p. 71: “By virtue of such protentional chains, we thus expect an ordered sequence of contents, for example, the tones of a melody, each with a distinct temporal position corresponding to its protended futurity.” The use of music as a metaphor to describe the experience of time and the structure of temporaliza- tion calls for a comparison with Bergson, who used the succession of notes in a musical piece to describe the texture of the inner duration of consciousness. See Bergson, Creative Mind, p. 176; idem, Time and Free Will, pp. 100–101, 127, 147; and discussion in Bruzina, “There Is More,” pp. 67–84, esp. 69–72.

With respect to this matter, Heidegger’s thought may be considered a poetic meditation on Anaximander who identified the principle or essence of all things as the indefinite (apeiron) , which is further characterized by the dialectical play of generation and destruction, the rendering of justice and reparation from one being to the other from their mutual injustice. See Serres, “Anaximander,” pp. 135–143; Dastur, “Heidegger on Anaximander,” pp. 179–190, esp. 185– 188. 215. Needless to say, many scholars have addressed the Heideggerian notion of the fourfold.

Schelling, Philosophical Investigations, p. 277. 224. There is thus a critical shift in the connotation of the term “indifference” in the different stages of Schelling’s thought. In the early phase of the Identity- Philosophy, “indifference” names the absolute identity of freedom and neces- sity in the first principle or “ground” (Grund) , the “source” (Quelle) and “root” (Wurzel) of all beings. (It stands to reason that an important source in this phase was Giordano Bruno, about whom Schelling did write a book.) On the central- ity of the coexistence of identity and difference in Bruno, see Calcagno, Giordano Bruno. In the latter phase of the post-Identity-Philosophy, “indifference” denotes the nonground in which all oppositions shatter, not through identity of differ- ence but through difference of identity. See Marx, Philosophy of F. W. J. Schelling, pp. 10, 67, 84; Kojève, Le Concept, pp. 262–277. 225. Schelling, Ages, pp. 6, 8. In preparation of this study, I have consulted the original German of Die Weltalter in Schelling, Sämtliche Werke, vol. 8. It is possible that Scholem’s account in Major Trends, p. 218, of the emanation of the sefirot as the autogenesis of God’s personality, the transformation of the void of no-iden- tity into the constellation of the “I,” from ayin to ani (in Hebrew these two words have the same consonants), is indebted to German idealism, and espe- cially Schelling. This possibility is enhanced by the fact that in this very context Scholem characterizes the emanation of the sefirot as a “dialectic process whose thesis and antithesis begin and end in God.” Biale, Gershom Scholem, p. 137, already noted that “Scholem’s repeated use of the word ‘dialectical’ and the philosophical account he gives to the Kabbalah suggests his explicit assumption of a‹nities between the Kabbalah and dialectical philosophies such as Hegel’s and Schelling’s.” See Scholem, From Berlin to Jerusalem, p. 113, where the author acknowledges having learnt about kabbalah from Philosophie der Geschichte oder Über die Tradition, a work written by Molitor, a pupil of Baader and Schelling. The influence of “romantic kabbalah” on the youthful Scholem is discussed by Kilcher, Sprachtheorie, pp. 331–345. Wasserstrom, Religion after Religion, pp. 5, 39, 39, 54–56, 159–160, expands the claim, tendering the provocative thesis that the theosophic ruminations of the esoteric Romantic philosophers Hamann, Schelling, Pasqually, Saint-Martin, Molitor, and Baader, traceable to Böhme and Christian kabbalists of the Renaissance, helped shape the “mythocentric” and “mystocentric” approach of all three historians of religion to the point that the very discipline functioned in their minds as a kind of Christian kabbalah. For the particular influence of Schelling’s narrative philosophy on Scholem, see ibid., Notes to Pages 34 – 35 193 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 193"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"pp. 100–101. Wasserstrom’s thesis dovetails Idel’s conjecture that “contempo- rary scholarship” on kabbalah, by which he means primarily Scholem and his disciples, has been informed by the overemphasis on the speculative, philo- sophical, and hermeneutical dimensions of the esoteric tradition promulgated in Renaissance Christian kabbalah and German idealism. See Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, pp. 7–8, 262–264. On Reuchlin’s rendering of kabbalah as a sym- bolic mode of thought and its influence on Scholem’s allegedly “harmonistic” and “monolithic” understanding (which may be traced to Schelling) of kab- balah as a “narrative philosophy,” see Idel, “Introduction,” pp. xv–xvi, xviii– xix. For the influence of Christian kabbalah on Scholem, including Renaissance figures (Pico, Reuchlin, Postel, and Rosenroth) and German romantics (Baader and Molitor), see Biale, Gershom Scholem, pp. 30–32, 76, 99, 121. 226. Scholem, Origins, p. 440, utilizes the expression “indifferent ’en-sof ” to characterize the viewpoint of Azriel of Gerona, which Johannes Reuchlin com- pares in De Arte Cabalistica to Nicholas of Cusa’s coincidentia oppositorum. The techni- cal term “indifferent,” however, must be distinguished from coincidence, inso- far as indifference means precisely that the opposites do not coincide but remain distinct. 227.

Here we should also recall the important comment in the “Urzelle” to The Star of Redemption, in Rosen- zweig, Philosophical and Theological Writings, pp. 56–57 (see reference to Haberman cited, op. cit., p. 57 n. 23). In describing the “God that is before all relation, whether to the world or to Himself,” the “seed-point of the actuality of God,” Rosenzweig mentions Schelling’s “dark ground,” “an interiorization of God, which precedes not merely His self-externalization, but rather even His self,” an idea that he further associates with what “Lurianic kabbalah teaches.” See Idel, “Franz Rosenzweig,” pp. 166 – 167.

Apparently reflecting the influence of Schelling, Scholem uses the expressions “indifferent with regard to the opposites” and “indifference of unity” to render the notion of hashwa’ah as applied to Ein Sof. As Scholem emphasizes, the notion of God’s indistinctness implies the equalization or coincidence, and not merely a conjoining, of opposites (he refers the reader to Judah Halevi’s Kuzari 4:25 as an illustration of the alternative). It seems to me that Scholem has incorrectly equated the Schellingian “indifference” and Cusa’s “coincidence,” for the former connotes the indeterminate that contains all determination in the preservation of opposites, whereas the latter signifies the rendering of all determination indeterminate in the collapse of opposites. See n. 224, this chapter. Also of interest in this connection is Scholem’s description of the “abyss of nothingness in which the world appears,” der Abgrund des Nichts, in dem die Welt erscheint, in the poem “Media in Vita,” recently published in Scholem, Fullness of Time, pp. 96–97. Even more enigmatic is Scholem’s further description of the world as “the reflection of that second face / which negates me, without tears,” die Spiegelung des zweiten Gesuchts, / das mich unerbittlich verneint. 238.

A possible biblical basis for the phrase “angel of the countenance,” der Engel des Angesichts, is the expression u-mal’akh panav, “and the angel of his face,” in Isaiah 63:9. This expression, attested in Jubilees and several Qumran sources, was most likely the basis for sar ha-panim, the “archon of the face,” a term applied to the highest angel, which includes predominantly Yahoel, Michael, and Meta- tron, according to a strand of Jewish angelology attested in later rabbinic and Heikhalot literature. The expression “angel of the Lord,” der Engel Jehovahs, is found in a number of scriptural verses, to wit, Gen 16:7, 9–11; 22:7, 15; Exod 3:2; Num 22:2–27, 31–35; Judges 2:1, 4; 5:23; 6:11–12, 20–22; 13:3, 13, 15–16, 18, 20–21; 1 Kgs 19:7; 2 Kgs 1:15; 19:35; Isa 37:36; Zech 1:11–12; 3:1, 6; Mal 2:7; Ps 34:8; 1 Chron 21:16. On the exegetical linking of mal’akh ha- panim and sar ha-panim as technical theophanic expressions and the aforemen- tioned verse from Isaiah, see Olyan, Thousand Thousands, pp. 105–109, and Idel, “Metatron,” pp. 36–41. For a selected list of other scholarly discussions of the relevant terms, see 3 Enoch, pp. 83, 118–119; Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, pp. 52, 63; Fossum, Name of God, pp. 189, 220–238, 307–324; Schäfer, Hidden, p. 36; Mach, Entwicklungsstadien, pp. 3–4, 14, 40 (and see n. 76 ad locum for discussion of the angel of the Lord as Logos or preexistent Christ in the Christian tradition), 55, 95–96, 204, 238; Deutsch, Gnostic Imagination, pp. 99–111; idem, Guardians, pp. 43, 152–157; VanderKam, “Angel,” pp. 378–393; and see references to some of my own work cited in n. 245, this chapter. Wirth in Schelling, Ages, p. 142 n. 62, suggests that Schelling’s term der Engel des Angesichts is from Luther’s translation of the Bible and refers to the “messengers that bring one to a medi- ating face to face [Angesicht zu Angesicht] with the all-consuming fire of the God- head.” This explanation does not exclude the etymology I have suggested. 243. See the instructive comments of Corbin, Paradoxe, p. 154. Notably, a similar interpretation of the angelic epiphany is offered by Swedenborg, Arcana Coelestia, 9:108, no. 6831. Swedenborg may have served as Schelling’s immedi- ate source, but it must be pointed out that the interpretation of Jesus, the “Divine Human” (Divinum Humanum), as the angelic “Grand Man” (Maximus Homo) is itself reminiscent of the kabbalistic notion of the anthropomorphic form of the glorious angel or angelic glory. See references to my studies in n. 245. Idel, “World of Angels,” pp. 64–66, points out that Swedenborg was influenced by this motif in Jewish mystical sources. The influence of kabbalah on Swedenborg is reconsidered by Williams-Hogan, “Emanuel Swedenborg,” pp. 343–360. 244. Schelling, Ages, p. 53.

The thematic connection between the Lurianic doctrine of s im s um, which is an act of limitation, and the primacy accorded the divine attribute of judg- ment in the older rabbinic teaching is noted by Scholem, Major Trends, p. 263. For an elaboration of this trajectory, see Liebes, Studies in Jewish Myth, pp. 27–28. 249. Schelling, Ages, p. 83. The association of wrath and contraction is found as well in Oetinger’s writings, which, in turn, influenced Hegel. See Magee, Hegel, p. 173. 250. Schulze, “Schelling,” pp. 154–166. Scholem, Major Trends, p. 412 n. 77, comments on the similarity between a statement of Schelling and the Lurianic notion of s im s um. See idem, Kabbalah, p. 134, and the comment from the Scholem Archive in the Jewish National and University Library, Jerusalem, cited by Kilcher, Sprachtheorie, p. 26. Interestingly, Scholem repeated this point in the last lecture he gave in Berlin, several months before his passing in 1982, on the place of kabbalah in European intellectual history. See Scholem, Explications, pp. 328– 329. For a more comprehensive study of this topic, see Schulte, “ Z im z um,” pp. 21–40. The similarity between Lurianic kabbalah (as presented by Scholem) and Schelling’s later philosophy is alluded to as well by Marx, Philosophy of F. W. J. Schelling, p. 95 n. 20. It is also of interest to recall the passing comment of Der- rida, Dissemination, p. 344, that the doctrine of s im s um is “linked to the mythology of ‘Louria,’ but it can also arise by way of ‘Hegel,’ ‘Boehme,’ etc.” 251.

Scholem’s exposé in Major Trends, pp. 216–217, of the first sefirah as the “abysmal will” or as the “abyss of nothing- ness,” which is the “pure absolute Being,” reflect the language of Böhme and Schelling. Scholem explicitly compares Böhme’s Ungrund and Azriel of Gerona’s identification of the divine will with ayin; see Origins, p. 436 and idem, Über einige Grundbegriffe, p. 76 n. 39. The zoharic authors follow the precedent of other kab- balists by associating the will with the first sefirah and thought with the second even though there are vestiges of the alternative view (attested, for instance, in passages in the bahiric anthology, the writings attributed to Isaac the Blind, and the compositions of Ezra of Gerona) that elevates thought to the supreme posi- tion. See Zohar 1:65a; Tiqqunei Zohar, sec. 19, 42a, and sec. 22, 68b (in that con- text, the “concealed thought” is identified as the “supernal crown” from with- out and as Ein Sof from within; on the attribution of the term ein-sof to Keter, see the section from Tiqqunei Zohar printed in Zohar 2:42b, and the passage from Ra‘aya Meheimna in Zohar 3:258a); and see discussion in Scholem, Origins, pp. 126– 131, 272–280; Tishby, Wisdom, p. 302 n. 4. 269.

According to some kabbalists, the concealment of Ein Sof is so great that one cannot attribute even the most minuscule inkling of will or desire to it. For example, compare the formulation of Azriel of Gerona, Perush Eser Sefirot, printed in Ibn Gabbai, Derekh Emunah, 4a, also cited in Ibn Gabbai, Avodat ha- Qodesh, 1:8, p. 17; and Cordovero, Shi‘ur Qomah, 10b–c (to be precise, in that context the author distinguishes two aspects of will, ra s on and hefe s , both of which are said to be within Keter, though neither can be ascribed to Ein Sof). 270.

My description is based primarily on Zohar 3:135b, a passage from the Idra Rabba section that may have been known to Schelling from the Latin transla- tion in Knorr von Rosenroth, Kabbala Denudata, 2:387–520; the passage I refer to appears on pp. 450–451. See also Zohar 3:26b, where Keter is called the “super- nal will,” the “concealed of all that is concealed,” and the “nothing” that “knows and does not know” the Infinite (ein sof) , which is demarcated further as the “concealment” within which is the “will of all wills.” At the same time, it is said that “there are no desires, lights, or sparks” in the Infinite. While it is not stated explicitly, I would suggest that the intent of this passage is to under- score that the supernal will is that which wills nothing, and in willing nothing it produces everything. Early kabbalists did speak of the dissemination of the Notes to Page 39 198 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 198"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"will. Consider, for example, Asher ben David, R. Asher ben David, p. 62. This Provençal kabbalist, the nephew of Isaac the Blind, explains that the divine potencies are called middot, literally “measures,” to express the “expansion of the will [ hitpash t ut ha-ra s on] from side to side.” I would surmise that the paradoxical notion of the infinite will demands logically that the expansion is a contraction, and thus that the attempt to mark a unique turn in Lurianic kabbalah by placing the withholding prior to the emanation is somewhat overstated and probably determined by excessive lexical concerns. On the idea of withdrawal in early kabbalah, see Idel, “On the Concept,” pp. 59–112. 273. Schelling, Ages, p. 107. 274. The paradox of the plenum-vacuum as it pertains to the pure con- sciousness associated with the mystical phenomenon is discussed in detail by Stace, Mysticism and Philosophy, pp. 161–178, concluding with a brief discussion of the kabbalistic Ein Sof based on comments in Scholem’s Major Trends. 275.

This seems to be Schelling’s interpretation of the first word of Scripture, bere’shit, “in the beginning,” which he renders as “in the most supremely ancient time,” in der allerältesten Zeit, that is, in the primordial time, the eternal time, that preceded the time of creation.

Schelling’s view may have been anticipated by Dionysius the Areopagite, Divine Names, ch. 10, 940A, p. 194: “There is a time in the writ- ings when eternity is glorified as being in time and time as being eternal. But if we more greatly and properly know these, we shall call and designate those beings which are by eternity and those beings which are subject to genesis by time. It is therefore necessary that we do not conceive those which are called eternal to be co-eternal with the God which is before eternity. . . . Further, we should interpret those beings which in some way [partake in] eternity and in some way [partake in] time to be intermediate between those which are and Notes to Pages 39 – 42 199 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 199"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"those which come to be.” In the continuation of the passage, God is extolled as being both eternity and time and beyond eternity and time. As one might expect from a Neoplatonist committed to Christian dogma, Dionysius views Jesus as the being in whom the opposites cohere. See ibid., ch. 1, 592B, p. 111: “From this the simple Jesus was ineffably composed; the everlasting received a temporal dimension and came to be equal in our nature with its unchanging and steady founding of those things which are fitting to it. Nevertheless, accord- ing to every nature, it exceeds every nature beyond every manner of being.” 290. Schelling, Ages, p. 45, and see references cited on pp. 140–141 n. 52. 291. Ibid., p. 80. 292.

In spite of Irigaray’s critique, the nexus that she herself a‹rms between femininity, the becoming of the body, and the disruption of temporality does share some important features with Levinas.

They are blind in the light of day, but they can see what is invisible. The god who inspires them shows them in a kind of revelation the truth that eludes the sight of men. This double vision relates, in particular, to the parts of time which are inaccessible to mortal creatures, namely, what happened in bygone days and what is yet to come .... But unlike the diviner, who usually has to solve prob- lems concerned with the future, the poet’s activity is almost exclusively con- cerned with the past .... He knows the past because he has the power to be present in the past. . . . The past thus revealed represents much more than merely the time prior to the present: it is its very source. By going back to it the process of recall seeks, not to situate events within a temporal framework, but to reach the very foundation of being, to discover what is original, the primeval reality from which the cosmos emerged and which makes it possible to under- stand the whole process of becoming. The genesis of the world . . . has a before and an afterwards but it does not unfold in one homogeneous period, in one single time. The rhythm of this past depends not upon a single chronology but upon genealogies ” (emphasis in original). 360. Abraham, Rhythms, p. 111. 361. The attuned ear will discern an influence of kabbalistic and Hasidic per- spectives on time in the remark of Heschel, Sabbath, p. 99: “Time, however, is beyond our reach, beyond our power. It is both near and far, intrinsic to all experience and transcending all experience. It belongs exclusively to God. Time, then, is otherness, a mystery that hovers above all categories” (emphasis in origi- nal). In light of this passage, I would take issue with the conclusion regarding Heschel’s phenomenology offered by Kaplan, Holiness, p. 85: “Time, not sym- bols, can partake of transcendence . . . but time as such cannot ‘symbolize’ the Divine.” Kaplan’s opinion is based on the presumed correlation between space and symbolic-mediated knowledge, on one hand, and time and immediate- intuitive insight, on the other (p. 175 n. 11). See idem, “Sacred versus Sym- bolic,” pp. 213–231. This is not the place to enter into a lengthy discussion on the role of the symbol in Heschel’s thought, let alone the connection of the symbolic to the modalities of time and space, but su‹ce it to say that in some passages he does seem to equate time with godliness in a manner that is unthinkable with respect to space. See Sabbath, p. 100: “Things of space . . . con- ceal the Creator. It is the dimension of time wherein man meets God, wherein man becomes aware that every instant is an act of creation, a Beginning, open- ing up new roads for ultimate realizations. Time is the presence of God in the world of space, and it is within time that we are able to sense the unity of all beings.” Closer to the mark is the observation concerning the “analogy between the dimension of time and the dimension of God’s glory, or between our rela- Notes to Page 54 204 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 204"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"tion to time and our relation to the glory” proffered by Merkle, Genesis, p. 103. See ch. 2 n. 3. Chapter Two 1. For an overview, see Hart, “Phenomenological Time,” pp. 17–45. 2. For a far-ranging study of various constructions of time in Jewish history, see Goldberg, La Clepsydre. Stern, Time and Process, challenges the notion that there was an abstract concept of time in ancient Judaism, a taxon that for him includes the biblical, Qumran, apocryphal, pseudepigraphical, and rabbinic corpora, as well as inscriptions. In Stern’s view, what we find, rather, are temporal processes demarcated by various signposts. Notwithstanding the interesting challenge set forth by Stern, I would still argue that it is reasonable to assume some conceptual structure underlying the terminological signposts that demar- cate the temporal processes. 3. On the contrast between Hebrew-temporal and Greek-spatial thinking, see Dobschütz, “Zeit und Raum,” pp. 212–223; Boman, Hebrew Thought, pp. 123– 183. The correlation of Jewish sensibility and time is advanced as well in many of the writings of Heschel. See Earth Is the Lord’s, pp. 13–17; Sabbath, pp. 3–10, 41, 48, 79–83, 96–101; God in Search of Man, pp. 200–201. This is not to say that Heschel thought it possible from a Judaic perspective to do away with the spa- tial coordinate; indeed, he duly recognized the interrelatedness of space and time. See Sabbath, pp. 6, 116–117. It is nevertheless legitimate to say that he privileged time over space as the more indigenous religious expression of Judaism, associating the spatial with idolatry and the temporal with monothe- ism. See Graeber, “Heschel,” pp. 44–56; Kaplan, Holiness, pp. 23–24; Merkle, Genesis, pp. 193 and 198; and the brief discussion in ch. 1 n. 361. A similar ori- entation is attested in Néher, “View of Time,” pp. 149–167. Finally, it is of interest to recall the conclusion reached by Kristeva, Time and Sense, p. 159, that according to Proust “Jewishness,” as opposed to “Judaism,” is an “inspiration for art” insofar as it is “the path of pure time embodied.” Here, too, an innate connection is made between Jewish experience and temporality. 4.

It is an illusion to believe that these two ways of looking at time are so different that they cancel each other out; they do have in common the principal feature, conception of time by the metaphor of a line, and what form the line takes is epistemologically of no importance or, in any case, only incidental.” For a challenge to the distinction between linear and cyclical modes of time, see Starr, “Historical,” pp. 24–35. 11.

On the privileging of the “prim- itive circularity of time” in Hellenic cosmological speculation, see the brief but incisive comments of Cornford, Principium Sapientiæ, pp. 168–171. Also pertinent here is the phenomenology of religion articulated by Mircea Eliade based on the correlation of sacred time and the myth of eternal renewal. I offer a modest sampling of Eliade’s studies that deal with this theme: Sacred and the Profane , pp. 68–113; Myth and Reality , pp. 21–91; Myth of the Eternal Return , pp. 3–92; Patterns in Comparative Religion , pp. 388 – 409. For a challenge to the presentation of the ancient Greek conception of time as cyclical becoming, see Vernant, Myth and Thought, pp. 88–90. According to Vernant, an alternative conception of time as an “irreversible line” emerges with the birth of lyric poetry in the seventh cen- tury BCE . 12. McConville and Millar, in Time and Place, demonstrate the complex inter- weaving of past, present and future as it relates to spatial and temporal dimen- sions of the deuteronomist’s conception of Israelite history.

More recently, Brin, Concept of Time, offers an exhaustive philological, but relatively feeble theo- retical, analysis of different terms for time in the biblical and sectarian literature. A more theoretically driven analysis related specifically to the rhythmic nature of ritual time is offered by Chilton, Redeeming Time. 13. Rappaport, “Ritual,” pp. 5–30, has suggested that ritual provides a mode of organization alternating between time and eternity, the latter being the real mark of sanctity. 14. Long after having written this chapter, though obviously prior to sending the manuscript off for publication, I came upon the essay of Sternberg, “Time and Space,” pp. 81–145. Sternberg’s presentation proceeds from an entirely different methodological perspective, but my analysis intersects with his on the crucial point of what he refers to as the “self-division” of “biblical poetics,” “an internal divergence between levels within its composition: between the order- ing of narratives (up to episodic units) and of narrative (cycles, books, canoni- cal history), blocks and architectonics, micro-plot and macro-plot if you will” (p. 83). Without entering into the details of Sternberg’s discussion, it is su‹cient to note that he, too, discerns linear and circular patterns of narrative time at work in the biblical text. See also Goldberg’s studies cited in n. 27, this chapter. Finally, the dismantling of the dichotomization of linear/historical and cyclical/mythical modes of time may have implications for undermining another binary presumed by many scholars, mythos versus logos. The bibliog- raphy on this topic is vast and I will here mention only the study by Strózewski, “Logos and Mythos,” pp. 175–188, as it provides an explanatory model that I find congenial to my own thinking: mythos is the way of understanding logos. 15. Voegelin, Order and History, vol 1., p. 352. 16. Ibid., pp. 395–396. At some point in the historical evolution of Chris- tianity as a natural outgrowth from Judaism, the eschatological overwhelmed the historical, but the prophets of ancient Israel did not posit the two as antin- omical. For an analysis of Voegelin’s views, see Hughes, Transcendence, pp. 40–53. A still useful discussion of the role of history and eschatology in early Christian thought is Quispel, “Time and History,” pp. 85–107. Finally, it is worth recall- ing here the thesis of Peuch, “Gnosis and Time,” pp. 38–84, that the mytho- logical orientation of ancient gnosticism rejected the linear temporality of Chris- tianity and the cyclical atemporality of Hellenism. From another perspective, however, the mythic perspective of the gnostics was a “bastard conception,” clumsily uniting the two worldviews in a manner that the temporal penetrated the atemporal and the atemporal absorbed the temporal. It strikes me that with regard to this crucial issue medieval kabbalah is to be distinguished from gnos- ticism, for the kabbalists’ embrace of rabbinic ritual enabled them to a‹rm both the teleological indeterminacy of history and the narratological redundancy of myth. 17.

Ricoeur, “History,” takes issue with the view that the biblical conception of time is exclusively linear, noting that festivals and ceremonial rites partake of a cyclical notion of time. See also Barr, Biblical Words ; Finegan, Handbook , pp. 6– 138; Robbins, “Time-Telling,” pp. 71–88. On the cyclical dimension of bibli- cal time, connected especially to the theme of retribution, see Trompf, Idea of Historical Recurrence, pp. 116–178. The rabbinic propensity to divest time of its lin- earity has been noted by several scholars. See Yerushalmi, Zakhor, pp. 5–26, esp. 17: “Unlike the biblical writers the rabbis seem to play with Time as though with an accordion, expanding and collapsing it at will. Where historical specificity is a hallmark of the biblical narratives, here the acute biblical sense of time and place often gives way to rampant and seemingly unselfconscious anachronism.” See also Bregman, “Past and Present,” pp. 45–59; Neusner, His- tory, vol. 5, p. xv; Rubenstein, “Mythic Time,” pp. 157–183; and the summary account in Rudavsky, Time Matters, pp. 4–10. 20. Rubin, “Historical Time,” pp. 11–12; Rubin and Kosman, “Clothing,” pp. 156–159. 21. The effacement of a cogent distinction between past, present, and future in paradigms of a world order proffered in the rabbinic canon is intelligently documented by Neusner, Handbook, pp. 179 – 198. I am in agreement with Neusner on the whole, but I do not accept his conclusion that the blurring of the difference between past, present, and future implies that for the rabbinic sages “time is neither linear nor cyclical but unremarkable” (p. 181). See also p. 187: “time in a system of perfection can be neither linear nor cyclical; time in his- torical dimensions simply is not a consideration in thinking about what happens and what counts. Instead, paradigms for the formation of the social order of transcendence and permanence govern, so that what was now is, and what will be is what was and is.” For a more detailed analysis, see Neusner, Presence, pp. 39–60. It is equally plausible to speak of a convergence of the circular and lin- ear to account for the rabbinic sensibility regarding the timeless nature of time and the timely nature of timelessness. Also relevant to this question is the analy- sis of Agus, “Innere Zeit,” pp. 87–111, and the brief comments regarding the Jewish indifference to time in Funkenstein, Perceptions , pp. 253–254. 22.

The first is an atemporal ‘basis’ from which there surges an infinitely repeatable, resounding impulse, cutting an inaccessible eternity into uniform or differenti- ated instants. The second is the, let me call it ‘biblical,’ succession of numbers, chronological development, evolution with an infinite goal; this is generally called historical time” (emphasis in original). I do not think this binary can be exegetically elicited from or eisegetically imposed upon Hebrew scripture or later Jewish literary sources.

I am here indebted to the formulation of Heidegger, On Time and Being, p. 24. Stambaugh’s rendering of the original German es sich Geheiß des zu Denkenden fügt ( Zur Sache des Denkens, p. 25) is superb, as she deftly captures the nuance and drift of Heidegger’s thought. Thinking, for Heidegger, consists of heeding the ancient word that repeatedly calls forth new readings on the path of listening/ appropriation. The possibility of interpreting Heidegger’s notion of truth in essentialist terms is curtailed by his further insight (expressed in the same liter- ary context) regarding the “ancient something which conceals itself in a-letheia. ” Inasmuch as that which is ancient (Uralte) hides itself (sich verbirgt) in the un- covering— a-letheia, the word that Heidegger uses to name the event of truth as unveiling—truth can never be uncovered except by being re/covered. 46.

Cordovero’s view on the eternally changing character of that which eternally endures was a‹rmed by kabbalists from earlier periods. For instance, in his Perush ha-Tefillot, MS Oxford-Bodleian 1938, fol. 206b, Azriel of Gerona observes that in the daily blessing expressing gratitude to God for giving the Torah, the language is noten, in the present, rather than natan, in the past, to instruct us that “in each and every moment he gives” (be-khol et wa-et noten) . 55.

Judah Loew of Prague, Gur Aryeh ha-Shalem, vol. 3, p. 215. 75. Maharal’s appropriation of the rabbinic notion of an ongoing revelation of the Written Torah is expanded by him (based, of course, on allusions in the rabbinic corpus itself) to include the Oral Torah. At the same time, however, Maharal adamantly insists that there is a decline through the generations that has created a chasm distancing the reader of his own time from the wisdom expressed by the rabbis. On this theme, see Elbaum, “Rabbi Judah Loew,” pp. 30–31; Veltri, “Science,” pp. 133–134. The possibility of recovering this wis- dom is predicated, it seems to me, on the hermeneutical bridging of past and present, a possibility buttressed by the ontological presumption concerning the time of the moment and the novel recurrence of what has been. 76. To be more precise, Maharal distinguishes three different levels of imma- terial being, which correspond to three forms of holiness implied in the Trisa- gion (Isa 6:3): the soul (nefesh) , which has a force (koa h ) in the body; the intel- lect (sekhel) , which has a connection (heqsher) with the body; and God who is completely separate from all things bodily.

Al-Qushayr i thus referred to the Sufi as the “son of his moment,” ibn waqtihi, that is, the Sufi is distinguished by the fact that he lives fully in the moment in which he must fulfill his religious duty. See Sells, Early Islamic Mysticism, p. 100; R u m i , Mathnaw i , 1:132–133, 3:1426. The intrinsic connection between Sufism and being-in-the-moment is repeated elsewhere by al-Qushayr i . See, for instance, Qushayr i , Principles of Sufism, p. 41: “They say concerning the meaning of renunciation, ‘Each speaks from his own moment [waqt] and indicates his own limit.’ ” And, ibid., p. 303: “ ‘Amr b. ‘Uthman al-Makki was asked about Sufism, and he asserted, ‘It is that the servant acts according to whatever is most fitting to the moment.’ ” Also pertinent is the remark of al-Junayd accounting for the dif- ferent presentations of the teachings of al-Bistam i , translated in Sells, Early Islamic Mysticism, p. 214: “The accounts passed down from Ab u Yaz i d are various and the raconteurs differ in what they heard. That might be—God knows best—because of the difference in the moments (awq a t) that had come upon him and the differ- ence in stationings (maw a tin) alternating in what was bestowed specially upon him.” On the term waqt, see the comments of al-Hujw i r i , Kashf al-Mahj u b, pp. 96– 104. The use of the term waqt by Sufis to denote the moment of epiphany was probably inspired by the use of the term in the Qur’ a n to refer to the “appointed time” of the day of judgment (15:38; 38:8; 56:50) as well as another term derived from the same root, m i q a t, which refers in some verses to a meeting with God (7:142, 143, 155) or to the time appointed for the last judgment (44:40; 78:17). See Gardet, “Moslem Views,” pp. 198–199. The Sufi use of waqt should be considered in light of the atomistic conception of time attested already in qur’ a nic verses. According to this occasionalist perspective, time (zam a n) does not exhibit continuous duration but consists rather of discrete atoms or instants ( a n a t or awq a t) ; every moment, therefore, is considered an accident of ephemerality that is a product of a constant re-creation (khalq f i kull waqt) . See Massignon, “Time,” pp. 108–114; Peeters, God’s Created Speech, p. 130; Pines, Studies in Islamic Atomism, pp. 29–31, 32–33, 57–64, 112–114. 94. Sells, Early Islamic Mysticism, p. 128. 95. From this vantage point, waqt is the temporal instantiation of the dialectic of fan a ’ and baq a ’ according to Sufi psychology, that is, the passing-away of the discrete self and abiding in what is real. Just as the moment exemplifies the dialectic of effacement and confirmation, so the awakened heart must abide in Notes to Pages 70 – 71 214 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 214"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"passing away and passes away in abiding.

On the mystical pilgrimage of the heart to the heart, symbolized by the Ka‘ba, as liberating one from the “bondage of time” (riqq al-awq a t) , see the passage from Ibn ‘Arab i in Elmore, op. cit., pp. 171 and 247. Consider also the formulation of Ibn ‘Arab i , Journey to the Lord of Power, p. 60: “When the influence of the Moment befalls him, he will receive it. Let him beware of becoming enamored of [the influence of the Moment] but let him remember it, for it will be necessary to him if he instructs .... The Moment lengthens and shortens in accordance with the pres- ence of the one who partakes in it.” The full implications of Ibn ‘Arab i ’s remarks are drawn out in the commentary of ‘Abdul-Karim Jili cited, op. cit., pp. 99–100 n. 40: “ ‘The Moment’ (waqt) is an expression for your state in time. The state does not attach itself to the past or the future. It is an existent between two nonexistents. And if your Moment is the wellspring of your state, you are the son of your Moment, and your Moment determines what you are, because it is existent and you are nonexistent, you are illusory and it is a‹rmed. . . . And whoever mourns over the past and fills the present moment with the past, he is one of those made distant. For he lets slip by what the current state demands, engrossed in what will not return. This is the essence of nonexistence. And whoever occupies himself with the future is in the same state.” For further dis- cussion of the problem of time in Ibn ‘Arab i ’s writings, see Rosenthal, “Ibn ‘Arab i ,” pp. 28–30; Böwering, “Ibn ‘Arab i ’s Concept of Time,” pp. 71–91. 98. Al-Hujw i r i , Kashf al-Mahj u b, p. 367: “ Waqt is that whereby a man becomes independent of the past and the future, as, for example, when an influence from God descends into his soul and makes his heart collected (mujtami‘) he has no memory and no thought of that which is not yet come. All people fail in this, and do not know what our past has been or what our future will be, except the possessors of waqt, who say: Our knowledge cannot apprehend the future and the past, and we are happy with God in the present (andar waqt) .” Al-Hujw i r i goes on to say that occupation with the future is a “great distraction” that veils one from God. It is of interest to recall here the account of “eternity” offered by Plotinus, Enneads III.7.5: “And if someone were in this way to speak of eternity as a life which is here and now endless because it is total and expends nothing of itself, since it has no past or future—for if it had, it would not now be a total life—he would be near to defining it.” The description of eternality as a simul- taneous whole is a‹rmed as well by Proclus, Elements of Theology, prop. 52, p. 1; see Smith, “Eternity and Time,” pp. 202–203. 99.

It is only a matter of manifesting the abandonment of one body and the receipt of another, therefore we should say that ‘before’ and ‘after’ are not two separate things for past and present are not different.

The contrast between the attempt to overthrow the privilege granted to the present in Heidegger and Derrida and the critique of N a g a rjuna’s middle way is explored as well in Loy, Nonduality, pp. 252–255. For a learned discussion on the nature of time in different but related historical-literary contexts, see Rospatt, Buddhist Doctrine. The central contention of the author is that “the doc- trine of momentariness is primarily based on the analysis of change in terms of substitution and on the conviction that things are always changing” (p. 217). On the notion of the moment (khana) as a central component of the Buddhist conception of timeless time, that is, the instantaneous awakening (ekaksan a b- hisambodhi) of the now that eternally endures as that which has no duration, see also Coomaraswamy, Time and Eternity, pp. 43–48. On the related Chinese con- cept of wujiu, literally, “without duration,” in Mohist doctrine, see Reding, Com- parative Essays, p. 99: “We can safely assume that the concept of wujiu is not to be understood in the sense of a time-atom, but rather as a boundary for periods of time .... This interpretation of wujiu as a boundary is also the more plausible one on the ground that the Later Mohists have developed a theory of potential infinity to solve the paradoxes of infinite divisibility.” On the Buddhist theory of atoms, see the brief but insightful discussion in Pines, Studies in Islamic Atomism, pp. 118–121. There are also grounds, both philological and conceptual, for studying Heidegger’s thinking in relation to the view of the moment as the full- ness of eternity articulated by Meister Eckhart.

It is worth noting that in the aforecited section of Sefer ha-Iqqarim, 80b, Albo does refer to the rabbinic notion of seder zemannim, which he contrasts with zeman: the latter is the time that is measurable in accord with the movement of the heavenly sphere, and thus it can be characterized in terms of before and after, whereas the former is not sub- ject to measurement since it is the flux that precedes the existence of the sphere (ha-meshekh she-hayah qodem me s i’ut ha-galggal) . 109.

See Guide, 2.30, pp. 349–350. 111. Genesis Rabbah, 3:7, p. 23. Urbach, The Sages, pp. 211–221, suggests that the notions of a “sequence of times prior to the world and worlds that preceded our world” found in rabbinic literature is a response to the gnostic conception (influenced by Platonic philosophy) of a world of eternity set in diametric con- trast to the created world of time. 112.

That which was before the (existence of the) sun is non-time and has no parts. That which had its beginning from the sun is time and has parts.” 123. An argument along these lines is found in Jacob ben Sheshet, “Sefer Sha‘ar ha-Shamayim,” p. 116. 124. Even the attribution of “primordiality” to Ein Sof is problematic, inas- much as this characteristic is a correlative term and hence to speak of Ein Sof as primordial is to place it within a temporal sequence. To avoid this dilemma, Cordovero uses the phrase qadmon beli qadmut, which I have rendered as “primor- dial without primordiality.” Cordovero is thus in basic agreement with the apophatic position adopted by Albo, Sefer ha-Iqqarim, 2:18, 80a: “The matter of primordiality and eternity [inyan ha-qadmut we-ha-ni sh iyyut] spoken with respect to him is a negative matter, the negation of privation qua beginning and qua end.” 125.

This is not the opinion of the Zohar or Pirqei Rabbi Eli‘ezer, which prove that the name YHWH is eternal in its primordiality [qadmon be-qadmuto] and it does not fall under time [we-eino nofel ta h at zeman] , God forbid.” See ibid., p.159: “The emanation, which [consists of ] the garments [ ha-malbushim] , was not from eternity [mi-qedem] , for they fall under time, as the Ari, blessed be his memory, wrote.” Ibid., p. 245: “If you say that the sefirot are eternal [qadmonim] , you contradict the words of the Ari, blessed be his memory, who said that the emanation was in time [ bi-zeman] , and even Adam Qadmon of [the world of ] creation [ beri’ah] was in time, as is known.” On the eternality of the sefirotic emanations, see ibid., pp. 142 156, 158, 174. The view that the ten sefirot were comprised in the potency of Ein-Sof is expressed in another work attributed to Eybeschuetz, We-Avo ha-Yom el Ein ha- H okhmah, MS Oxford, Bodleian Library 955, fol. 112a. 142. Cordovero, Pardes Rimmonim, 4:4, 17d. 143. Ibid., 18:3, 84c. 144. See n. 111, this chapter. 145. I borrow this expression from Rappaport, “Ritual,” p. 12. 146. The kabbalistic understanding of time as attributable to the divine nature is reminiscent of the identification of Allah as time (dahr) attested in var- ious dicta (for example, fa inna All a ha huwa al-dahr, “God himself is time”) trace- able to an old strand in the Islamic tradition, indeed, a tradition transmitted in the name of God as the speaker ( h ad i th quds i ) : “God said: Man insults Me in blaming time (dahr) ; I am time (An a al-dahr) . In My hands is the command (amr) , and I cause the alternation of night and day.” See Böwering, “Ideas of Time,” pp. 206 – 207. Consider also the remark of Ibn ‘Arab i , Divine Governance, p. 240: “Our Master, the Messenger of Allah, said: Do not curse Time, for Allah is Time. pointing out that Allah’s being is free from likeness or equals or part- ners, but is manifest in eternal time.” For discussion of the ascription of tem- porality to the divine centered around the terms dahr (aeon) and zam a n (time), see Chittick, Self-Disclosure of God, pp. 128–132. In a manner strikingly analogous to the kabbalistic idea, time is treated in Sufi teaching as divine and related specifically to the nocturnal-diurnal oscillation. For similar implications in the Zoroastrian depiction of Zurw a n, see n. 166, this chapter.

On the symbolic identification of the rabbinic idiom seder zemannim as Tif’eret and Malkhut, see Cordovero, Or Ne‘erav, ch. 7, p. 65. Needless to say, Cor- dovero was not the first kabbalist to adopt this symbolism. See, for instance, Ibn Gabbai, Avodat ha-Qodesh, 1:22, p. 52; 4:5, p. 424. 148. This understanding of temporality underlies the comment of Cor- dovero’s student Abraham Azulai, H esed le-Avraham, 6:4, p. 244, that the reality of the different gradations of soul (nefesh, rua h , and neshamah) is “dependent on the time of the supernal coupling [zeman ha-ziwwug ha-elyon] .” Azulai’s point is that the precise disposition of the soul, created as a consequence of the union in the divine will, is determined by the constellation of forces above at the precise moment of conception below. This idea rests on the understanding of time articulated in the body of this chapter. 149. Cordovero, following a long-standing kabbalistic tradition, assumes a homologous relation between primal Adam and the Jewish male. See Wolfson, “Ontology,” pp. 131–155. In the extended version of this study, which appears as the first chapter in Venturing Beyond, I cite and analyze some of the relevant Cor- doverian texts. On this theme, see the independent study by H allamish, “Rela- tion to the Nations,” pp. 289–311. 150. Cordovero, Tefillah le-Moshe, 190a. 151. It is of interest to compare Cordovero’s view on the relationship between time and Torah to the explanation of the phrase seder zemannim in Ibn Gabbai, Avodat ha-Qodesh, 1:23, p. 54: “Time is subservient and compliant to Torah, for it was created by means of it, and thus it and everything that is beneath it are ready to be submissive to keepers of the Torah. Before Israel stood [at Mount Sinai] it was in the hands of the holy One, blessed be he, but after Israel stood and received the Torah, which is above time, it was given to them to abrogate his warnings from evil to good, to remove his judgment, and to restore it to its nature as it was prior to the primal sin by means of Torah, which is above the order of time.” 152. Cordovero, Pardes Rimmonim, 4:6, 19d. 153. The distinction between “physical” time and “metaphysical” time that I have applied to kabbalistic ontology resonates with Newton’s concept of absolute time, which he distinguishes from relative time. The latter is the meas- urable time kept by human devices, whereas the former is rooted in the ever- lasting duration of God’s eternal being.

I am here influenced by the description of sacred time in Kristensen, Meaning of Religion, pp. 377–388, esp. 386–387. Kristensen focuses on the exam- ple of Zervan, the supreme God of Zoroastrianism, who is identified as infinite time and in whom opposites are united, transforming finitude into infinity and temporality into eternity. See Zaehner, Zurvan. It is of interest to recall in this connection the comments of Rubin, Heidenthum und Kabbala, pp. 33–34, on the temporal implications of the designation Atiqa, the “ancient one,” one of the zoharic terms for the uppermost emanation. Rubin links the kabbalistic symbol to archaic traditions regarding the divine nature of time, including the Zoroas- trian deity, Zurvan, and the Greco-Roman Chronos, or Saturn. 167.

For a learned presentation of the philosophic (mostly Neo- platonic) and gnostic elements that may have contributed to the representations of time in Azriel’s treatises, see Gavarin, “Conception of Time,” pp. 309–336. Although the rabbinic idiom seder zemannim is not used explicitly, it is implied in the interpretation of Genesis 1:5 in Ezra ben Solomon of Gerona, Perush Shir ha- Shirim, p. 506. 179. This paradox is reiterated by Azriel in his explanation of the term eser sefirot belimah in Perush Sefer Ye s irah, p. 453: They are called sefirot “because they are the potency of everything delimited in the quantity of ten,” and the adjective belimah denotes that “they are the opening to the infinite, for God cannot be fath- omed, he has no substance [mahut] , and he is without-whatness [ belimah] .” 180.

The expression sheva qe s awwot maqom is attested in a manuscript version (MS Moscow, Guenzburg 133, from late-fifteenth- or early-sixteenth-century Germany) of the long recension of Sefer Ye s irah 4:3. See Gruenwald, “Preliminary Critical Edition,” p. 157, sec. 38; Asher ben David, R. Asher ben David, p. 84. The more accepted reading is sheva qe s awwot, which correspond to the seven double letters, one of the three divisions of the twenty-two Hebrew letters according to the second part of Sefer Ye s irah. As the relevant passage makes clear, the seven extremities comprise the six directions (above, below, east, west, north, and south, which are designated as the “six extremities,” shesh qe s awwot; see also 1:13) and the holy palace that is set in the middle. Azriel’s usage is preceded by Ezra ben Solomon of Gerona, Perush Shir ha-Shirim, pp. 488 and 507. It is of inter- est to note that in the commentary to this passage in Sefer Ye s irah, which preserves the teachings of Isaac the Blind, the seven doubles are described as the “inner realities,” penimiyyot, which have branches, anafim, corresponding to the “seven days, seven weeks, seven years, and seven sabbaticals.” The author of this state- ment places the focus on the temporal as opposed to the spatial implied by the “seven extremities of place.” See Gavarin, “Conception of Time,” p. 310. 189. Azriel of Gerona, Perush ha-Aggadot, pp. 80–81. 190. The convergence of time and space in kabbalistic doctrine has been noted independently and with a different emphasis by Pedaya, “Divinity as Place and Time,” p. 85. 191. This is not to deny that some kabbalists expressed a monistic orientation, but, in my judgment, those who did so were more inclined to an acosmism that denies the independence of the world vis-à-vis God, rather than to a pantheism that undermines the transcendence of God vis-à-vis the world. 192.

I will not concern myself with the aspect of temporality linked to the kabbalistic conception of cosmic cycles (shemi tt ot) . For a brief background of this idea, see Book of Mirrors, introduction, pp. 31–33. 223. The thematic connection between liturgical worship and temporality expounded by medieval kabbalists should be seen as a sensitive attunement to the rabbinic institution of three daily statutory prayers. This is not the oppor- tune place to elaborate on this issue, but su‹ce it to say that from a phenome- nological standpoint the rabbinic conception of prayer, modeled on the priestly sacrificial rite, is intricately bound with the diurnal and nocturnal patterns of time. For discussion of the historical development of this rite, see Fleischer, “On the Beginnings,” pp. 397 – 441. Finally, it is worth recalling the insightful observation of Buber, I and Thou , p. 59: “prayer is not in time but time is in prayer.” 224.

The kabbalistic notion of the single eye may be com- pared favorably to a similar symbol utilized by Böhme to depict the primal man- ifestation of the Ungrund, the mirror in and through which the imageless Absolute is manifest. See Koyré, Philosophie de Jacob Boehme, pp. 331–336. On the possible kabbalistic influence in the writings of Böhme, see essays by Schulitz and Schmidt-Biggemann cited in ch. 1 n. 232. 231. An illustration of this conception is found in Shalom Dov Baer Schneer- sohn, Qun t res u-Ma ‘ ayan mi-Beit ha-Shem, p. 84: Time is linked to the emanative process from H okhmah to Malkhut, the garbing ( hitlabshut) of the light of intellect (or ha-sekhel) from the head to the feet of the divine anthropos; the will, which is linked to Keter, is not connected to any particular vessel or limb, and thus acts instantaneously and concurrently in the head and foot. 232.

It is also pertinent to recall here the image of truth as the daughter of time. See Saxl, “Veritas Filia Temporis,” pp. 197–222; Yates, Astraea, p. 80. In Tiqqunei Zohar, sec. 69, 101b, the androgynous nature of time is cast in terms of the distinction between the “hour” (sha‘ah) , which is feminine, and the “day” (yom) , which is masculine. See Elijah ben Solomon, Tiqqunei ha-Zohar im Be’ur ha-GR”A, 115b: “Man [adam] and time [zeman] correspond to male and female, spirit and soul [rua h we-nefesh] ... in time itself the day [ ha-yom] is male and the hour [sha ‘ ah] is female. Therefore yom is gram- matically masculine and sha ‘ ah is feminine.” 238. I have explored this matter in many studies. Here I shall note the most recent sustained analysis, which has the merit of making more explicit the con- nections between kabbalistic phallocentrism and Lacanian psychoanalytic the- ory: “Circumcision, Secrecy, and the Veiling of the Veil,” pp. 58–70, and the expanded version in Wolfson, Language, Eros, Being, pp. 111–141. 239. It is worth mentioning the injunction to the priests (Exod 28: 42–43) to wear linen breeches to cover their genitals, literally, the “flesh of nakedness,” besar erwah, lest they enter the tabernacle in an immodest posture and bring upon themselves a death decree. Perhaps it would be fruitful to consider these verses in relation to the death of Nadab and Abihu. 240. Zohar 3:58a–b. 241. Ibid., 58b. It is instructive to compare the thematic nexus of prayer and the mystery of time related to the divine in zoharic texts and the comments in Mysteries of Purity, pp. 184–185. Ibn al-‘Arab i relates the esoteric gnosis to the qur’ a nic verse “Allah’s is the command before and after; and on that day the believers shall rejoice” (30:4). 242.

It is of interest to consider the principle derived or linked exegetically to this verse by Abraham bar H iyya, Hegyon ha-Nephesch ha-Atzuvah, p. 80: “The holy One, blessed be he, does not heed Notes to Pages 98 – 100 226 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 226"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"the prayer of man in accordance with the will of the worshipper but rather in accordance with the will of his Creator, as it is written ‘As for me, may my prayer come to you, O Lord, at a favorable moment’ (Ps 69:14), a moment in which the will is before you [et she-yihyeh ra s on mi-lefanekha] .” 243. Needless to say, the word et has a long history in Hebrew texts, begin- ning in scripture where it is used to designate events of time perceived not chronologically but as distinct manifestations of divine volition. See Brin, Con- cept of Time, pp. 39–48, 294. 244. Zohar 3:58a. 245. See, by contrast, Tiqqunei Zohar, sec. 21, 43a, where the expression itto de- s addiq refers to Yesod and not to Shekhinah. In Tiqqunei Zohar, sec. 69, 101b – 102a, there is a lengthy discourse on the symbolic identification of Shekhinah and time, related especially to the word et; the monthly lunar cycle is divided into 28 ittot, 14 from the side of mercy and 14 from the side of judgment, which are linked exegetically to the 28 occurrences of the word et in Ecclesiastes 3:2 – 8. On the association of the term et and Shekhinah, and a decoding of the expression itto as referring to the union of Shekhinah and Yesod, in the thirteenth- century Spanish kabbalist Joseph Gikatilla, see Wolfson, “Fore/giveness,” pp. 165 – 166 n. 11. 246.

A similar image is attested in the Buddhist tradition, where the weapon of Indra, the thunderbolt or diamond cutter (vajra) , is utilized to depict the “non- conceptual, ever-fresh awareness, supreme and indestructible,” the discerning vision that cuts through obstructing elements to make a space for the “primor- dial state of pure and total presence.” See Manjusr i mitra, Primordial Experience, pp. 73–74. 253.

In some zoharic passages, the sword functions as an androgynous sym- bol and thus it is associated with Yesod, the phallic gradation, which comprises male and female. In other contexts, the image of the sword is associated more specifically with Shekhinah in the feminine facade of divine judgment, though Notes to Pages 100 – 103 227 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 227"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"even in this case the female is portrayed in decidedly masculine, even phallic, terms, the “sword that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant,” h erev noqemet neqam berit (Lev 26:25); expressed otherwise, the symbolic figuration of judg- ment is the feminine dimension of the male. See Tishby, Wisdom, p. 1365; Wolfson, Circle, pp. 87 and 204 nn. 36–37. 256. Zohar 1:221b. In a section from the Tosefta stratum printed in Zohar 2:27b- 28a, the scriptural image of laha th erev ha-mithappekhet, “fiery ever-turning sword” (Gen 3:24) is applied to both Binah and Malkhut, the former insofar as “it changes from judgment to mercy to bestow upon the righteous their reward in the world-to-come,” and the latter insofar as “it changes from mercy to judgment to judge the wicked in this world.” 257. The point is made in slightly different terminology in the commentary of Na h manides to the scriptural expression “this is the blessing,” we-zo’t ha- berakhah (Deut 33:1), Perushei ha-Torah, vol. 2, p. 491: “By way of truth, ‘this’ [we- zo’t] is the ‘blessing’ [ ha-berakhah] , ‘for from the Lord this [zo’t] was’ (Ps 118:23), and, similarly, with respect to Jacob it is said ‘and this [we-zo’t] is what their father said to them’ (Gen 49:28). ‘This is the blessing’—this is what was spo- ken by David, ‘This [zo’t] has been my lot, for I have observed your precepts’ (Ps 119:56). This alludes to Zion, the city of David, ‘there the Lord ordained bless- ing, everlasting life’ (ibid., 133:3), and the enlightened will comprehend [we- ha-maskil yavin] .” Na h manides reads the expression we-zo’t ha-berakhah as an appos- itive rather than constructive, that is, zo’t is the berakhah, thereby forging an essential link between Shekhinah and blessing, a link that is dependent, moreover, on the fact that Shekhinah is like a vessel that holds the overflow of the blessing received from the emanations above her. At the conclusion of the relevant pas- sage, Na h manides draws the obvious conclusion: “for the word ‘this’ [zo’t] alludes to the blessing [ berakhah] , which is the Torah, and this is the covenant [ berit] , as it is written ‘this is my covenant’ [zo’t beriti] (Isa 59:21).” 258. David ben Yehudah he- H asid, Sefer ha-Gevul, MS JTSA Mic. 2197, fol. 25b. 259. In Zohar 2:51a, the verse be-zo’t yavo aharon el ha-qodesh (Lev 16:3) is cited to anchor the idea that the way to approach the king is through the angelic medi- ator, sheli h a de-malkka be-kholla, “the angel of the king in all things.” This angelic being, also designated by the technical terms “angel of God,” mal’akh ha-elohim (Gen 31:11; Exod 14:19, Judges 6:20, 13:9; 2 Sam 14:20), and “guardian of Israel,” shomer yisra’el (Ps 121:4), refers symbolically to Shekhinah, the symbolic referent of the pronoun zo’t. While there is nothing explicit or implicit in this passage to justify positioning the divine presence in the corona of the phallus, it seems to me nevertheless reasonable to presume that the gender of the angelic glory, which is the glorious angel, is masculine. 260.

The locution “day that is entirely long,” yom she-kullo arokh, which is attested in earlier medieval sources (for instance, Tosafot ha-Ro’sh, Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 13a), is based on the more frequently used rabbinic designa- tion for the eschatological state, the “world that is entirely long,” yom she-kullo arokh, which parallels the expression “world that is entirely good,” olam she-kullo t ov — terminology that is linked exegetically to the reward mentioned in con- junction with the command to honor one’s parents, “that you may endure, and that you may fare well,” lema ‘ an ya’arikhun yameikha u-lema ‘ an yi t av lakh (Deut 5:16). See Babylonian Talmud, Qiddushin 39; H ullin 142a. And compare Palestinian Talmud, H agigah 2:1, 77b, where the related turn of phrase, “future that is entirely long,” atid she-kullo arokh, appears as a parallel to “the world-to-come that is entirely good,” le-olam ha-ba she-kullo t ov. In that context, the exegetical reference is the scriptural reward for setting the mother bird free when taking the fledg- lings from the nest, “in order that you may fare well and have a long life,” lema ‘ an yi t av lakh we-ha’arakhtta yamim (Deut 22:7). Mention should also be made of the related eschatological expression “day that is entirely Sabbath,” yom she-kullo shabbat. See Babylonian Talmud, Rosh ha-Shanah 31a; Sanhedrin 97a; Tamid 3b; Avot de-Rabbi Natan, version A, ch. 1, 3a.

The idiom ke-lo h ashiv is derived from the expression ke-lah h ashivin used in Daniel 4:32 to denote the powerlessness of the nations vis-à-vis God, but the source that is likely to have influenced the acosmic orientation of Habad is the following description of God in Zohar 1:11b: “He is the master and ruler, the root and source of all worlds, and everything before him is considered as noth- ing [we-khola qameih ke-lo h ashivin] , as it is said, ‘all the inhabitants of the earth are considered as naught’ (Dan 4:32).” For similar language, compare the depic- tion of the splitting of the sea in Zohar 2:170a-b, “When the will rose before him, everything was considered before him as nothing [kola qameih ke-ayin hu h ashiv] .” 277.

The bahiric symbolism is related thematically and exegetically to several rabbinic passages centered on the question why the world was created with beit, the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet, which is the first letter of Torah, pre- sumed by the authors of the relevant texts to be the instrument and matrix of creation. See, for instance, Genesis Rabbah, 1:10, pp. 8–9; Palestinian Talmud, H agigah 2:1, 77c; Pesiqta Rabbati, vol. 1, 21:52, pp. 502–503. In other midrashic passages, where the exegetical focus is on anokhi, the first word of the Decalogue (Exod 20:2), it is emphasized that Torah begins with alef. See Genesis Rabbah, 1:10, p. 9; Pesiqta Rabbati, vol. 1, 21:56, pp. 506–507. 5. Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 104a. In the teaching on the alef-beit attributed to the “infants” (darddaqei) , gimmel and dalet are interpreted as gemol dallim, to bestow charity on the poor. See also Midrash Otiyyot de-Rabbi Aqiva, p. 345: “If there is no gimmel, there is no dalet; if there is no dalet, there is no gimmel. If there is no charity (gemilut h asadim) , there would be no poor (dallim) ; if there are no poor in the world, there would be no charity.” On the link between dalet and dal, see Bahir, § 19, p. 129. 6. Bahir, § 13, pp. 123–125. 7. For discussion of this presumably older mythical structure in the bahiric anthology, see Wolfson, Along the Path, pp. 73–75. In that context, I also explore the alternative expression of this mythologoumenon, which relates the totality of divine potencies to the three letters of the word ish (alef, yod, shin) , “man.” The prooftext cited as biblical support for the anthropomorphic portrayal of God is “The Lord is a man of war” (Exod 15:3). See Bahir, § 18, p. 127, and the later reworking of this passage in § 84, p. 171. Finally, mention should be made of the interpretation of the letters of the divine name offered by Arnaldo de Vil- lanova in Allocutio super Tetragrammaton, which was composed in 1292: yod refers to the Father, which is described as the “principle without beginning” (principium sine principio) , waw to the Son, which is the “principle of beginning” (principium ex principio coeternum) , and he to the Holy Spirit that emerges from the first two prin- ciples. See Scholem, “Beginnings,” p. 25. Although the doctrine of ten poten- cies became the prevalent theosophic view as kabbalah evolved in the thirteenth century, vestiges of the older mythologic structure are discernible. This is so, for instance, in the approach attested in zoharic literature (especially prominent in the Idrot strata) whereby the Godhead is depicted as comprising three configurations (par s ufim) : Arikh Anpin (or Atiqa Qaddisha ), Ze‘eir Anpin, and H aqal Tapu h in Qaddishin, which correspond to the hybrid of Ein Sof and Keter (repre- sented in some passages by the image of three heads), the sefirotic edifice from H okhmah to Yesod, and Malkhut.

On the triadic representation of the Godhead, see the account of the arrayment (tiqqun) of the letter alef in Zohar H adash, 60d, into a yod above (implied and not mentioned explicitly), waw in the middle, and dalet below: “The image and mystery of Adam in two forms, the head above is the primordial point that ruled over everything through the inscription, for it is crowned to disseminate below. Waw, which is the secret and image of Adam, he and his spouse, the dalet below that is attached to his side, and this is the perfection of Adam.” For a dif- ferent decomposition of the orthography of alef, see ch. 4 n. 23. 8. The letter alef is connected to ro’sh as well in Bahir, § 18, p. 127 (see previ- ous note). 9. In the enumeration of the ten utterances (ma’amarot) in Bahir, § 96, p. 181, the second, which is identified as h okhmah, is also given the name re’shit, the beginning (linked to Ps 111:10). 10.

The association of “origin” and the “way of negation” in Rosenzweig’s thinking reflects Hermann Cohen’s account in his Logik der reinen Erkenntnis (1902) of the “principle of origin” (Ursprungsprinzip) as the nothing (das Nichts) that con- stitutes the “true abyss of thought” (Abgrund für das Denken) , the not-being (Nicht- sein) that is the fount of being (Sein) . For Rosenzweig, as for Heidegger, the ide- alist conception proffered by Cohen is mythologized as a narratological recounting of the springing forth of a pre-cognitive nothing, the unthinkable negativity of ontological difference, the particularity of the unassailable nought that severs the dialectic identity of thought and being.

The distinction between Anfang and Beginn figures prominently in Heideg- ger’s presentation of the destinal character of philosophy in the infamous Rectoral Address delivered at the University of Freiburg in 1933, Die Selbst-behauptung der deutschen Universität.

See Bahir, § 33, p. 137: “It has been taught ‘the glory of God is to conceal the word’ (Prov 25:2). What is the ‘word’? ‘The beginning of your word is truth’ (Ps 119:160).” In this passage, a connection is made between the “begin- ning” and concealment of the word — or truth — appropriate to the divine glory.

This text is discussed in ch. 4 at n. 34. See § 104, p. 187, where the sev- enth of the ten sayings is identified as the east of the world whence the seed comes to Israel, “for the spinal cord draws from the brain and comes to the penis and from there is the seed, as it is written, ‘from the east I will bring my seed’ (Isa 43:5).” On the spinal cord (linked to the palm branch, lulav, which is part of the four species of Sukkot ), see also § 67, p. 159. 34. It is of interest to recall here the observation in Liesen, Full of Praise, p. 123, that in ancient Near Eastern wisdom literature the expression me-ro’sh has two meanings: the “temporal-empirical, referring to the first or most important position in a chain of events (‘beginning’), or logical-ontological, referring to a foundational event outside time (‘principle’).” My reading of the bahiric fragments advocates that the second meaning is intended by cognate terms such as bere’shit and ba-ro’sh. 35. The distinction between origin and beginning is cast in slightly different terminology in Zohar 3:26b, where the “primordial” one (qadma’ah) , also identified as Ein Sof, is contrasted with the first, ro’sh, the “supernal point” (nequdah ila’ah) , the “beginning of everything” (reisha de-khola) , and the “con- cealed one that exists within thought” (setima de-qayyama go ma h shavah) . The begin- ning, which clearly should be identified with the attribute of H okhmah, produces the “terminus” (sof) , which is also identified as the “end of the word,” sof davar, that is, Malkhut. Ein Sof, in and of itself, is incomprehensible and it cannot be depicted by either beginning or end. 36. The view I have attributed to the bahiric passage can be profitably com- pared to the remark in Elias, Death before Dying, p. 56: “Those who find the Beloved in the letter alif need not open the Qur’an to read it. / When they blow with the breath of love, the curtains are pushed aside.” Alif, the first letter of the Arabic alphabet, stands metonymically for Allah. The shape of the letter, a ver- tical line, is identical to the figure that signifies the number “one,” and hence it may be seen as symbolic of divine unity. The one God can be found in the breath of love that is outside and beyond the scriptural text. Analogously, in the bahiric parable, alef is the first that precedes Torah, which begins with beit, the beginning. 37. The matter of the tail of beit is repeated in what appears to be a somewhat garbled text in Bahir, § 11, p. 123: “To what may beit be compared? To a man who is created through wisdom, for he is closed on every side and opened in front. The alef is open from behind. He said: The tail of beit is open from behind it, for if it were not so man could not exist. Similarly, if not for the beit in its tail, the world would not exist.” For a later development of the bahiric imagery, see Isaac of Acre, Sefer Me’irat Einayim, pp. 12–13: “In the beginning” [ bere’shit] (Gen 1:1), the beit is enlarged, and similarly Sefer Ye s irah begins “By means of thirty-two etc” [ bi-sheloshim u-shettayim] , for the beit alludes to Notes to Page 123 236 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 236"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Keter, for it is the abode [ bayyit] of all the sefirot, and thus it is enlarged. And there are those who say that the stem [oqe s ] of the beit instructs that there is one [e h ad] that is prior to the beginning [re’shit] , which is the nothing [ayin] .... The word [ bere’shit] is crowned with the crown of the beit, which alludes to [the fact that] beit is Keter. Therefore the account of creation begins with beit, which alludes to Keter, which is Thought [ma h shavah] , and everything is within it. 38. In Bahir, § 17, p. 127, reference is made to the light hidden by God until the suitable time. This aspect of the primordial light is deduced from the fact that the verse proclaims “Let there be light” (wa-yehi or) , rather than “and there was light” (we-hayah or) . The description of the light as “already having been” (she-kevar hayah) , parallels the account of the beit as pointing with its tail to its source , alef. 39. See n. 5, this chapter. In Bahir, § 92, p. 177, the attribute of love, middat h esed, is attributed to Abraham, who was said to bestow kindness upon the world, gamal h esed ba-olam. This passage reflects the theosophic interpretation of the fourth, fifth, and sixth of the ten sefirot that was current amongst kabbalists at the time of the redaction of Bahir. The three attributes of the divine—love ( h esed) , fear (pa h ad) , and truth (emet) — are correlated respectively with the three patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. See also §§ 129, 131–132. 40. The notion that gimmel is the realization of alef is possibly the intent of the enigmatic remark in Bahir, § 20, p. 129, regarding the relationship of gimmel, dalet, and he. According to that passage, he is formed by taking the top part of gimmel and the bottom part of dalet. The letter he, it seems, represents the fullness of divine wisdom, which may be the intent of the comment that there is an upper he and a lower he, an idea expressed elsewhere in the bahiric anthology in terms of an upper and lower Shekhinah (see n. 81, this chapter). 41. That is, the Torah, which begins with bere’shit, the first letter of which is beit. 42. In the verse, the word yam does not connote “sea,” but rather the west- erly direction. I have rendered the biblical language, however, in light of the parabolic exegesis of the author of the bahiric text. 43. The connection between beit and blessing is made in earlier rabbinic sources. According to one especially noteworthy exegetical tradition, God cre- ated the world with beit and not alef, since the former is the first letter of the word berakhah, “blessing,” whereas the latter is the first letter of arirah, “curse.” See Palestinian Talmud, H agigah 2:1, 77c; Genesis Rabbah, 1:10, p. 9; Pesiqta Rab- bati, vol. 1, 21:54, pp. 504–505. 44. There is no extant verse in Hebrew scripture to which this refers as noted by Scholem, Das Buch Bahir, § 3, p. 6 n. 2. 45. Bahir, § 3, p. 119. 46. For discussion of this and other bahiric passages with special focus on the nexus between secrecy and the gift, see Wolfson, “Hebraic,” pp. 156–167; idem, Language, Eros, Being, pp. 158–161.

The identical theme is expressed in slightly different terms in Bahir, § 43, p. 141. According to the parabolic image employed in that context, the one who wants to enter within the chambers of the king must first look or contem- plate (yistakkel) the daughter in whom the king has placed all thirty-two paths of wisdom. On the application of the symbol of the house (bayit) to Shekhinah, which is also identified as sukkot, the temporary booths that commemorate the dwellings inhabited by the Israelites in their sojourn through the desert (Lev 23:43), see Bahir, § 74, p. 163. See also § 104, p. 189, where Shekhinah, associ- ated with the west (ma‘arav) since all the seed that comes forth from the east is mixed (mit‘arev) within it, is referred to as the “house of the father.” The uti- lization of the beit to signify the feminine potency is based, in part, on the rab- binic interpretation of the word bayit as a metaphorical reference to one’s wife. See, for instance, Mishnah, Yoma 1:1, commenting on Leviticus 16:6, and the fuller discussion in Baker, Rebuilding, pp. 34–76. 49. The bahiric reflection on the orthography of beit being closed on three of four sides is based on a similar line of inquiry found in several rabbinic sources (attributed to R. Levi whose teaching was transmitted by R. Yonah), but in those contexts the shape of the letter is interpreted as an admonition that one should not engage in speculation regarding what is above, below, before, or after creation. See Palestinian Talmud, H agigah 2:1, 77c; Genesis Rabbah, 1:10, p. 8; Pesiqta Rabbati, vol. 1, 21:52, pp. 502–503. 50. Genesis Rabbah, 68:9, pp. 777–778; Midrash Tehillim, 90:10, pp. 390–391. 51.

For a skillful philological and philosophical account of phusis and the “initial essence of being,” see Zarader, Heidegger, pp. 33–47. On presencing as the site of concealment in relationship to techne as bringing forth (Hervorbringen) and phusis as the emerging of things of their own accord, see McNeill, Glance, pp. 298–299. 55. Here my language reflects the technical term Zeit-Raum of Heideggerian thought, the time-space, the abgrund, which belongs to the essential sway of truth as the sheltering-enclosure. See Heidegger, Contributions, pp. 259–271. 56. The notion of determinate indeterminacy is embraced explicitly in Bahir, § 103, p. 187. The context wherein this appears is an enumeration of the sev- enth of the ten sayings (ma’amarot) that help one articulate the nature of being (see § 96, p. 181; see also § 32, p. 135). I will translate the relevant passage: “The seventh? There are only six. Rather, this teaches that here is the holy palace [ heikhal ha-qodesh] , it bears all of them, it is considered as two, and it is the sev- Notes to Pages 124 – 125 238 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 238"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"enth. What is it? Just as thought has no end or limit, so this place has no end or limit.” The seventh, which is apparently in the position of the phallic potency according to a symbolic system attested in this section of the Bahir, the east whence the seed disseminates to Shekhinah, who resides in the west (see Scholem, On the Mystical Shape, pp. 93 – 94) is here characterized in terms that parallel thought, which is the first of the emanations. The latter identification helps us date the material, as it belongs to the stratum of the text reflecting the theo- sophic symbolism regarding the infinite thought of the divine current in Provence and northern Spain in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. This thought is without end or limit and, analogously, the place of the seventh is without end or limit. Here, then, is a utilization of the principle of determinate indeterminacy, albeit with a different symbolic valence. 57. My formulation is indebted to Desmond, Desire, pp. 184–185. The onto- logical theme expressed by the shape of beit may also be expressed in terms of the convergence of freedom and necessity, that is, the concurrence of the open and closed aspects insinuates that within the Godhead there is no reason to dichotomize these two elements. God’s absolute freedom stems from the neces- sity of the divine nature and, conversely, the necessity of divine nature is deter- mined by God’s absolute freedom. For an attempt to collapse the distinction between freedom and necessity in God in a manner that is consonant with kab- balistic ontology, see Schelling, Ages, p. 5. See n. 67, this chapter. 58. According to the masoretic text, ha-olam is written defectively, i.e., with- out a waw, and thus it can be vocalized as he‘elem. 59. Bahir, § 8, p. 121. 60. Babylonian Talmud, Pesa h im 50a, Qiddushin 71a. There are some who think the word olam may in fact be connected etymologically to alam, that which is hidden. Through their midrashic playfulness the rabbinic exegetes may have retrieved something of the original intent of the notion of world in ancient Israel. 61. At the conclusion of the bahiric passage (see n. 59), the first three words of Torah are cited and explicated: “As it said ‘In the beginning God created’ (Gen 1:1). And what is ‘created?’ The needs of all ( s orkhei ha-kol) , and afterward God (elohim) . And what is written after it? ‘Heaven and earth.’ ” The point of ending with this exegesis is to underscore that Torah, which is alluded to in the word bere’shit, was the first of all things fashioned. For a more detailed interpre- tation of this passage, see Wolfson, Along the Path, pp. 72–73. I have modified my translation here in light of a new insight regarding the meaning of the text. See also Bahir, § 74, p. 163: “Why is Pentecost [a s eret, the rabbinic name for the hol- iday; see Mishnah, Rosh ha-Shanah 1:2; H agigah 2:4] one [day]? For on it the Torah was given to Israel, and when the Torah was created initially [ re’shit] , the holy One, blessed be he, ruled in his world alone with it, as it is written ‘The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord’ (Ps 111:10).

For references, see ch. 2 n. 181. 63. Bahir, § 4, pp. 119–121. 64. The imagery is repeated in Bahir, § 37, p. 139, but in that context it is also given an eschatological valence: What is the beit at the end [of the word zahav ]? As it is written, “Through wisdom the house will be built” (Prov 24:3). It does not say “was built,” but rather “will be built.” In the future, the holy One, blessed be he, will build her and adorn her two thousand times more than what she was, as it is said “Why is the beginning of the Torah with a beit? ” As it is written, “I was with him as a confidant, a source of delight every day” (Prov 8:30), two thousand years, for the day of the holy One, blessed be he, is one thousand years. Therefore, the Torah begins with beit. The beit [of the word bere’shit ] signifies two thousand and afterward is re’shit, as it is said “two thousand years belong to him,” for he is the beginning ( [re’shit] . 65. According to the parable in Bahir, § 14, p. 125, God plants the tree that is called kol, “all,” so that the “entire world will take pleasure in it” (lehishta‘ashe‘a bo kol ha-olam) . The end of that passage alludes to the “secret” that involves the hieros gamos, here depicted as God planting and rooting the tree in the ground. For discussion of this passage, see Wolfson, Along the Path, pp. 71–72. 66. In this matter, kabbalistic symbolism is consonant with rabbinic theolog- ical speculation on the two primary attributes of God, mercy and judgment, a point I made briefly in one of my earliest published studies. See Wolfson, “Mys- tical-Theurgical Dimensions,” pp. 63–64. 67. A philosophical presentation of the kabbalistic dialectic is offered by Schelling, Ages, p. 6: “Therefore, two principles are already in what is necessary of God: the outpouring, outstretching, self-giving being, and an equivalently eternal force of selfhood, of retreat into itself, of Being in itself. That being and this force are both already God itself, without God’s assistance.” This is precisely what I have found to be the case in my study of kabbalistic documents. The dialectic of mercy and judgment, overflowing and containing, is the balance of life and the measure of eros even unto death. Interestingly, Schelling uses the language of “retreat” to characterize the force of selfhood, of being in itself as opposed to the self-giving being. According to the kabbalistic doctrine of s im s um, the withdrawal of divine light, the holding in of the breath, is similarly understood to be an expression of limitation, demarcation, and the setting of boundary, qualities that are associated with the traditional attribute of judg- ment. I have dealt with the matter extensively in “Divine Suffering.” A number of scholars have noted Schelling’s indebtedness to kabbalah, whether transmit- ted directly or through an intermediary.

In § 105, p. 189, the king is said to have seven gardens and in the middle garden there is a “beautiful spring that flows from the source of living water” (ma‘ayan na’eh nove‘a mi-maqor mayim h ayyim) . See also § 121, p. 205, where the “pipe” is linked exegetically with the verse “You are a garden spring, a well of living waters that flows from Lebanon” (Song 4:15). 69. In Bahir, § 90, p. 175, the mythical conception of sha‘ashu‘a is depicted in the image of the troops of the king who bemuse themselves (mishta‘ashe‘im) with the Matrona secluded in his chamber. 70.

The circle of mythopoeisis and scriptural exegesis has been an integral part of my understanding of kabbalistic hermeneutics. For a summary account, see Wolfson, “Images of God’s Feet,” pp. 143–144. See also Fishbane, Biblical Myth, pp. 108–109. 73. It would be useful to compare the philological difference between e h ad and bere’shit according to the bahiric exegesis and the distinction Ibn al-‘Arab i made in his theosophic explication of the basic Muslim profession of divine unity, taw h i d al-ul u ha, between a h ad, whence derives the word a h adiyya, and w a h id. See Chittick, Sufi Path of Knowledge, pp. 244–245. 74. Here it is of interest to note the following exegetical comment preserved in Palestinian Talmud, Berakhot 9:2, 13c–d: “R. Joshua ben H ananiah said, When the spirit [rua h ] went out into the world, the holy One, blessed be he, broke it against the mountains and weakened it in the valleys, and he said to it, Be mindful not to harm my creatures. For what reason? ‘For spirit before me is faint’ (Isa 57:16).’ He weakened it as it is said ‘my spirit failed within me’ (Ps 143:4). Why to such length? R. Huna said in the name of R. A h a, ‘I am the one to create souls’ (Isa 57:16), on account of the souls that I have made.” It seems to me that implicit in this remark is a presumption regarding a potential conflict between God and spirit; accordingly, the latter is admonished not to harm the souls created by the former. It is curious that a gnostic reading of this verse also seems to be attested in the bahiric fragment. The matter requires more research. 75. In Bahir, § 96, p. 181, the first of the ten sayings, the supernal crown (keter elyon) is described as the “one of ones unified in all his names” (e h ad ha-a h adim ha- meyu h ad be-khol shemotav) . Although this belongs to a later stratum of the bahiric anthology, it expresses in more technical philosophic terms an older mythical notion. 76. I note the a‹nity to the bahiric perspective found in the chapter on dual- ity in De occulta philosophia, one of the most influential Renaissance compendia on Notes to Pages 127 – 129 241 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 241"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"esoteric wisdom, composed by Henry Cornelius Agrippa and published in 1521: “Binarius primus numerus est, quia prima multitudo est. . . . Binarius autem primum unitatis germen et prima procreatio” (Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, 2.5, p. 257; I have also consulted Three Books of Occult Philosophy, p. 245). The “first number” (primus numerus) is “two” (binarius) because it is the “first mul- titude” (prima multitudo) , that is, it is two, not one, even though it is first and not second, and hence it is appropriate to refer to the number two as the “first branch of unity” (primum unitatus germen) and the “first procreation” (prima procre- atio) . Agrippa further describes two as the “number of connubiality and sex” (numerus connubii et sexus) , as there are two sexes, masculine and feminine, an idea expressed figuratively in the image of two doves (columbae bina) that produce two eggs, out of the first emerges the masculine and out of the second the feminine (ex quorum primo masculum, ex secundo foeminam excludunt) . The number two, moreover, is spoken of the “middle” (medietas) since it has the capacity to “partake of good and evil” (bona malaque participans) , the “beginning of division” (principium divisionis) , “multiplicity and distinction” (multitudinis et distinctionis) , that which “signifies matter” (significat materiam) . A consequence of the characterization of two as the principle of division is that negative images are associated with it, to wit, dis- cord, misfortune, confusion, strife, boldness and even the devil. Agrippa con- cludes the chapter by delineating a series of items drawn from Hebrew and Greek scripture as well as from cosmolgical structures that typologically sym- bolize the dual nature of two, a verbal delineation that is accompanied with a scala binarii, a diagram of the different applications of the number, which has in the center of the top row the words Yah [ yod-he] and El [alef-lamed] , nomina Dei duarum literarum, “names of God expressed in two letters” (De occulta philosophia, 2.5. pp. 258–259; Three Books of Occult Philosophy, pp. 245–247). It should be noted that the diagrams describing the characteristics of numbers that accompany each chapter begin with a Hebrew name or names for God composed of the exact number of letters, for instance, Shaddai is associated with the number three and YHWH with the number four. 77.

According to the dictum reported there in the name of R. Levi, study of Torah leads to acts of kindness. 79. In Bahir, § 65, p. 159, the expression “sea of wisdom,” yam ha- h okhmah, is used to name the attribute that is also referred to as the “earth” or “precious stone,” and corresponding to it is the blue that is used in the fringe garment, a Notes to Pages 129 – 130 242 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 242"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"hue that is reminiscent of the sea, the heaven, and the throne of glory (based on the teaching attributed to R. Meir in Babylonian Talmud, Mena h ot 43b). This passage seems to reflect the doctrine of ten potencies. Accordingly, the attrib- ute designated by these terms is Shekhinah, the tenth of the sefirot. The older myth, in my opinion, identified the second of the three potencies as the sea that is Torah, the fullness of divine wisdom. In light of this tradition, it is of interest to consider the comment, which apparently is from the period of redaction, in Bahir, § 111, p. 197: “The holy One, blessed be he, at first gave them well- springs of water and afterward he gave them stones. . . . What is the reason? For at first the Torah in the world was compared to water and afterward it was fixed in a set place, which is the not the way of water, for today it is here and tomor- row it moves on.” 80. See, however, Bahir, § 128, p. 211. Interpreting the rabbinic dictum (Mishnah, Avot 2:5) that a layman (am ha-are s ) cannot be a saintly person ( h asid) , the author of the bahiric text writes: “How can one do kindness with his mas- ter? Through study of Torah, for he who studies Torah bestows kindness upon his master, as it is written ‘riding the heavens through your assistance’ (Deut 33:26). That is to say, when you study Torah for its own sake, then you assist me and I ride the heavens, and consequently ‘through the skies in his majesty’ (ibid.). What are the skies [she h aqim] ? I would say the chamber of chambers [ h adrei h adarim] .” In contrast to § 34, where the nexus between Torah study and gemilut h asadim was explained in terms of the human being drawing benefit from the divine attribute of mercy, in § 128, it is God who benefits from the human act, which bestows kindness. More specifically, in the latter passage, the theur- gical principle is embraced whereby the activity of the human being facilitates the union of the divine, which is portrayed in the scriptural language of God’s riding the heavens in his majesty, ga’awah. I propose that this term is employed here as a euphemism for the phallus and that the expression h adrei h adarim, which is the meaning offered for she h aqim, refers to the female genitals. See Bahir, § 85, p. 171. On the term ga’awah in earlier Jewish mysticism and its resonance in Ger- man Pietistic literature, see Wolfson, Along the Path, pp. 13–14, 57, and reference to other scholarly works given on p. 125 n. 88. In that study, I was hesitant to offer a phallic interpretation of ga’awah, but it appears to me that such an expla- nation is warranted, especially in the passages from the Rhineland Jewish pietists. On the theurgical role accorded Torah study as a means to unite the masculine and feminine potencies of the divine, see Bahir, § 137, p. 221, and analysis in Wolfson, Circle, pp. 10–13. 81. The characterization of wisdom as light (either explicitly or implicitly) occurs in a number of passages in the bahiric anthology. See Bahir, §§ 10 and 12, p. 123; § 17, p. 127; and especially § 116, p. 201: “He sat and expounded to them, ‘There is Shekhinah below just as there is Shekhinah above.’ What is this Shekhinah? I would say that it is the light that emanated from the first light, which is wisdom. It, too, surrounds everything as it says ‘the earth was filled with his Notes to Page 130 243 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 243"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"glory’ (Isa 6:3).” On the description of Shekhinah as the light taken from the “first light,” which is identified as the “fear of the Lord,” and hidden away for the righteous, see § 131, p. 215. See also § 133, p. 219. 82. In Bahir, § 71, p. 161, the pillar that connects heaven and earth and sus- tains the world is identified as the righteous one ( s addiq) . See also § 85, p. 171, where the souls of the righteous are described as issuing from the “spring” (ma‘ayan) to the “great pipe” ( s innor ha-gadol) whence they cleave to the tree. The righteous ones of Israel below serve as a catalyst to incite this process. In § 105, p. 189, the eighth of the ten sayings is identified as the righteous one that is the foundation of the world. The activities of sustaining the world and making it prosper associated with this attribute resemble the description of gimmel in § 13, p. 125. 83. Palestinian Talmud, Berakhot 9:2, 14a; Genesis Rabbah, 13:13, p. 122. Also relevant for an appreciation of the medieval kabbalistic symbolism is the fact that the gender attribution of the upper and lower waters is expressed together with the notion that the water that falls from heaven is masculine and the earth that is irrigated thereby is feminine. See Pirqei Rabbi Eli‘ezer, ch. 5, 13a. 84. For discussion of this mythical structure and the conjecture regarding its archaic provenance, see Wolfson, Along the Path, pp. 73–74. 85. Here my language reflects Heidegger. See, in particular, Contributions, p. 137. 86. A source for this geometric symbolism that became so crucial in the evo- lution of kabbalistic thought is found in Bahir, § 83, p. 169. 87. The passage from the M u lamadhyamakak a rik a is cited from Kalupahana’s translation in N a g a rjuna, p. 162. 88. Heidegger, On Time and Being, p. 3. 89. A number of scholars have reconsidered the origins and evolution of the pivotal kabbalistic doctrine of s im s um, withdrawal and/or contraction. To date, the most comprehensive study is Idel, “On the Concept.” Idel, op. cit., p. 71, suggests that the image of cutting through the rocks in Bahir, § 4, which is found as well in a number of thirteenth-century kabbalistic texts, may allude to a doctrine of s im s um. In his argument, Idel did not mention the exegesis of Isa- iah 48:9 in the same bahiric passage, but my interpretation corroborates his suggestion. 90. It is of interest to wonder whether the reference to this verse implies a technical application of the term a’arikh appayim — or the nominative form to which it is undoubtedly related erekh appayim (Exod 34:7)—to the aspect of God that is also referred to as the name (shem) and the glory (tehillah) . According to the interpretation I have accepted, these terms denote the feminine potency of the divine, which is also symbolized as wisdom or Torah. Here it must be re- called that in kabbalistic texts from the zoharic period the highest aspect of God is designated by the term arikh anpin and the lower aspect by ze‘eir anpin (see n. 7, this chapter). According to some sources, the latter term is applied to Shekhinah, Notes to Pages 130 – 133 244 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 244"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"which is the feminine persona.

On the distinction between tehillah, “praise,” and tefillah, “prayer,” see Bahir, § 46, p. 143. 92. Vestiges of what I assume is a much older myth that has had a profound impact on the formation and evolution of kabbalistic symbolism can be found in the bahiric anthology. See Bahir, § 12, p. 123 (in that passage, the parabolic image of the king preparing a crown to rest on the head of his son prior to cre- ating his son is employed to explain the notion that light preceded the world), § 61, pp. 153–155, and § 72, pp. 161–163. In my scholarly writings, I have returned to this theme repeatedly, interpreting it as a mythic portrayal of the gender transformation of the fallen female through her restoration to the head of the male. See, for instance, Wolfson, “Coronation,” pp. 301–344. For dis- cussion of some of the applicable bahiric passages, see Green, Keter, pp. 134– 150. 93. In Bahir, § 49, pp. 145–147, time is depicted in terms of the polarity of night and day with the latter being contained in the former. I have analyzed this passage in Circle, pp. 86–87. 94.

The attribution of coldness to the woman is based on the ancient associa- tion of coldness and water.

That is, the letter-name mem in Phoenician and Hebrew can be traced to the zigzag Egyptian hieroglyphic for water. This ancient symbolism is reflected in the second part of Sefer Ye s irah, where the three matrix letters, alef, mem, and shin, are correlated respectively with the elements of air, water, and fire. Interest- ingly, the influence of the water symbol of mem is discernible in the Greek let- ter mu, and, in an Orphic verse describing Zeus, mu is combined with alpha and omega to signify “beginning, middle (meson) , and end.” See Barry, Greek Qabbalah, pp. 77–78, 181. Consider the reworking of Isaiah 44:6 in Revelation 1:8. The passage is discussed in chapter 5. In Revelation 21:6, the depiction of God as alpha and omega is associated with the image of the “fountain of the water of life” (based on the expression meqor mayyim h ayyim in Jer 2:13). On the role of water to mark both the beginning and end of the ministry of Jesus, see Jones, Symbol of Water, pp. 36–88, 178–218. 4. Literally, “the abdomen.” In Bahir, § 87, p. 173, it is stated that all of the twenty-two Hebrew letters with the exception of t eit are comprised in the ten sefirot. The reason given for this exclusion is to instruct one that “ t eit is the be t en. ” Presumably in this context as well, be t en signifies the womb and not the stom- ach. If this assumption is granted, then the exclusion of t eit from the sefirot should be interpreted in misogynist terms. The use of be t en to refer to the womb is attested already in biblical Hebrew (Gen 25:23, 24, 30:2, 38:27; Deut 7:13, 28:4, 11, 30:9; Judges 13:5, 7, 16:17; Isa 13:18, 46:3, 49:15; Jer 1:5; Ps 22:11, 71:6, 127:3, 132:11, 139:13; Job 1:21; Eccles 5:14). The usage is attested in medieval Jewish polemical texts as well, which lends support to my explication of the bahiric text. See, for example, the passage from Sefer Ni ss a h on Yashan (late thirteenth or early fourteenth century), published in Jewish-Christian Debate, p. 68 (English section; original text in Hebrew section, p. 27): “Certainly, then, you who err in saying that something holy entered into a woman in that stinking place—for there is nothing in the world as disgusting as a woman’s stomach [ke-ve t en ishshah] , which is full of feces and urine, which emits discharge and menstrual blood and serves as the receptacle for man’s semen—you will certainly be consumed by ‘a fire not blown’ [Job 20:26] and descend to deep- est hell.” A similar usage is attested in medieval Judeo-Arabic polemical litera- ture. See Lasker and Stroumsa, Polemic of Nestor, vol. 1, pp. 53, 67; and the corre- sponding original texts in vol. 2, pp. 28, 51. 5. Bahir, § 46, p. 143. 6. See ibid., § 66, p. 159, where masters of esoteric wisdom—the “right- eous” and “pious” in Israel—who can theurgically elevate God through prayer are identified as those who pledge their hearts to be removed from mundane matters.

Another interesting similarity between the bahiric passage and Maimonides is the nexus established between prayer and emptying the mind of all mundane matters. Particularly germane is the definition of liturgical intention in Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Tefillah 4:16. See preliminary remarks in Wolfson, “Mystical- Theurgical Dimensions,” p. 74 n. 131. It is of interest to note that one of the earliest kabbalists in Provence, Asher ben David, links the contemplative approach to prayer in Maimonides to the ancient pietistic ideal of meditation, which resonates with the kabbalistic orientation enunciated in his day. See Asher ben David, R. Asher ben David, pp. 80–81; and analysis in Wolfson, “Beneath the Wings,” pp. 226–228. 10.

I note, parenthetically, that in medieval Hebrew usage the term “hearing” does not always have an aural implication. On occasion, to “hear” means to read, a connotation that stems from the philological fact that hearing metaphor- ically signifies understanding, as well as from the social practice of reading in the Middle Ages in the form of listening to oral recitation of a written text.

On balance it seems right that the visual and auditory poles cannot be completely separated.

The impact of the contemplative ideal of mystical worship is evident as well in Bahir, § 60, p. 153. In that passage, the one who visually contemplates the chariot, ha-mistakkel bi- s efiyyat ha-merkavah, is contrasted with one who ascends in thought, alah ba-ma h shavah. The reading in MS Munich 209, fol. 11a, repro- duced in Bahir, p. 152, is ha-mitpallel bi- s efiyyat ha-ma h shavah yarad we-a h ar kakh alah, “the one who prays through the vision of thought descends and subsequently ascends.” In the margins of the manuscript, however, the first three words are corrected to she-ha-mistakkel bi- s e‹ya[t] ha-merkava[ h], “for the one who contem- plates the vision of the chariot.” In my judgment, the marginal emendation is correct; the author of the passage wanted to contrast the meditational technique of contemplation of thought and the visualization practice of gazing upon the chariot. The expression “descend,” yarad, is used in conjunction with the latter since the visionary field has a terminus; by contrast, yarad cannot be applied to thought since it is without limit and therefore impervious to visual terminol- ogy, as the continuation of the passage makes clear: ba-ma h shavah leit bah s efiyyah kelal we-leit leih takhlit we-khol deleit beih sof we-takhlit leit lehu yeridah, “With respect to thought there is no vision at all and it has no terminus, and anything that has no end or terminus has no descent.” The traditional idiom applied to God, kakh alah ba-ma h shavah, “thus it arose in thought,” assumes mystical significance in the bahiric text, as the ascension in thought depicts the contemplative ideal.

See also § 103, p. 187, where the “place” of the holy palace, the seventh of ten ma’amarot, is described as having “no end or limit” in the manner of “thought that has no end or limit” (ma h shavah she-ein lah sof we-takhlit) . 23.

For references to this symbolism in earlier rabbinic sources, see ch. 3 n. 4. 25.

See ibid., § 94, p. 179, where torat emet, which is positioned within the attribute called “Israel,” is described as sustaining the ten sayings even though it is to be counted as one of them. See ibid., § 87, p. 173, where the ten sefirot through which heaven and earth were sealed correspond to the ten commandments, which are described further as comprising the totality of the 613 commandments. 29. Bahir, §§ 54–55, pp. 150–151. 30. In Bahir, § 114, p. 199, the divine attributes are delineated as the “eight extremities” in man, to wit, left and right hands, left and right feet, head, body, penis, and the woman who is the mate of the man. Insofar as the body and the penis are considered to be one (de-guf u-verit h ad hu) , the eight can be reduced to seven. See also § 116, p. 201, where the seven holy forms of God are correlated with seven bodily parts in the human being, right and left thighs, right and left hands, penis (referred to as guf bi-verito suggesting that here the word guf is used to designate the male organ, which is given the name berit; see n. 36, this chap- ter), head, and the female counterpart who completes the male’s embodiment. 31. See, however, Bahir, § 95, p. 181, where the word az is interpreted as an allusion to the divine potencies, which are referred to as the ten sayings by means of which the world was created. Alef comprises the first three potencies and zayin the remaining seven. Interestingly, in that context, the “enlightened” (maskkilim) in Israel who know the “secret of the glorious name” (sod ha-shem ha- nikhbad) can raise their palms to heaven in prayer, a possibility that is linked exegetically to the verse “Then, when you call, the Lord will answer” [az tiqra wa- yhwh ya‘aneh] (Isa 58:9). The kabbalists know the secret of the name, which is translated into their worshipping by means of the ten emanations comprised in the word az. In my judgment, this passage reflects the theosophical conception that evolved in the period of the redaction of Sefer ha-Bahir, which presumed a plentitude of ten divine powers. See also ibid., § 134, p. 219, where the request of Moses “Show me your glory” (Exod 33:18) is interpreted as a desire “to know the knowledge of the glorious name” (leda yedi‘at ha-shem ha-nikhbad) .

The line of thinking is continued and extended in the comment attributed to Simeon ben Yo h ai in Zohar 1:65a about the nature of prayer as the means to ascertain the moment of transition in the Godhead from nothing to something, from silence to speech. 32. For instance, Bahir, §§ 39, p. 139; 105, p. 189; 114, p. 199; 116, p. 201 (in this context, the idiom of “seven holy forms” is employed to characterize the attributes of God that correspond to seven parts of the human body; see n. 30, this chapter). 33. In a number of studies, I have commented on the inseparability of the apophatic and kataphatic elements of the contemplative experience. See Wolf- son, “Negative Theology;” idem, Abraham Abulafia, pp. 9 – 38; idem, “ Megillat ’Emet, ” pp. 58–62. See also Gerhart, “Word Image Opposition,” pp. 63–79. 34. Bahir, § 56, p. 151.

See Bahir, § 67, p. 159, where the spinal cord, which is correlated sym- bolically with the palm branch (lulav) , the “crown of the tree” (nof ha-illan) or the “trunk of the tree” (guf ha-illan) , is designated the “essence of the body” (iqqar ha-guf) . 36. The word guf in ibid., § 56, p. 151, should perhaps be understood as a circumlocution for the penis. The intent of the passage, then, would be that the brain overflows to the spinal cord, and from there the flux of energy spreads out to the male organ. Support for this reading can be adduced from § 104, p. 187: “the spinal cord draws from the brain of man and it comes to the penis [ammah] and from there comes the seed as it is written, ‘from the east I will bring your seed’ (Isa 43:5).” See also § 116, p. 201, where the main part of the penis is referred to as guf bi-verito; see n. 30, this chapter. And ibid., § 126, p. 209, where the word “body” (guf) in the talmudic dictum that the messiah shall not come until “all the souls in the body perish” (Babylonian Talmud, Yevamot 62a) is associated with the phallic potency of the divine, which is identified as the seventh attribute, the goodness of God, Sabbath, the eternally living one ( h ei olamim) , the all (ha-kol) in whose hand is the treasury of souls (o s ar ha-neshamot) . 37. It is possible that the phallic connotation of nun is related to the associa- tion of this letter with the demonic potency of the serpent (na h ash) in Zohar 3:180b. See Wolfson, Along the Path, p. 220 n. 158. 38. See Bahir, § 139, p. 223, where the palm-tree (tamar) is first identified as feminine and then as comprising masculine and feminine, for the branch of the tree is masculine and the fruit is masculine from the outside but feminine from the inside. The nucleus of the date is linked symbolically to the vagina, which in turn is associated with the power of the moon. In this passage, one discerns as well the ontological assumption regarding the containment of the female in the male. 39. Ibid., § 58, p. 153. 40.

The analysis here is based on my pre- vious discussion. Compare the remark of Na h manides in his report of the Barcelona disputation in 1263, translated in Maccoby, Judaism on Trial , p. 134: “The truth is that the Messiah will come and he will be completely human, the son of a man and a woman from their intercourse just like myself.” On the pos- sible influence of Marian veneration on the formation of the bahiric symbol of Shekhinah, see Schäfer, “Daughter,” pp. 221–242; idem, Mirror, pp. 147–216. Although Schäfer refers to my study on the Jewish-Christian context of a cen- tral bahiric symbol-complex, he does not consider the dimension of my study that casts the issue in terms of the medieval setting. The lack of attentiveness is most apparent in Schäfer’s summary of my view in Mirror, pp. 237–238, where he focuses on the part of my argument that proposes an ancient mytholo- goumenon but totally ignores the other part that addresses the issue of the pres- entation and modification of the older teaching in light of the twelfth-century milieu. See also the parenthetical comment of Schafer, “Jewish Mysticism,” p. 18, that the “obviously Christian context” (emphasis in the original) of Sefer ha- Bahir “hasn’t been explored at all.” For another attempt to highlight the Marian dimension of kabbalistic representations of Shekhinah, see Green, “Shekhinah,” pp. 1–52. Alas, Green, too, neglected to mention the work I have done that focuses on the complex relationship between Christian imagery and kabbalistic symbolism in general or the analysis of the bahiric symbolism in particular. 45. On the sense of disgust related to a presumed physical birth of the Son of God, which would entail both the pollution of the seminal flux and the impu- rities of the womb, see the extensive analysis in Cuffel, “Filthy Words,” pp. 117–212. 46. An assault on the irrationality of the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation is not uncommon in medieval Jewish texts, and in some cases this mode of argu- ment was meant to counter Christian polemicists who argued for the rational and naturalist conception of the virgin birth. See Cuffel, “Filthy Words,” pp. 283– 350; Chazan, Fashioning, pp. 264–265, 268–273, 334, 349–350. 47. Bahir, § 42, p. 141. 48. See Wolfson, “Circumcision, Secrecy,” pp. 59–61. 49.

Like a female, as the womb from above.” 54. See, however, Bahir, § 25, p. 131. In that context, the open mem is associ- ated with the aspect of the head upon which is placed the crown or phylacter- ies. This attribute is also depicted parabolically as the throne upon which the king sits and the phylacteries that he places upon his arm. It seems that the text is describing the hieros gamos in the divine world through various images, includ- ing that of coronation, that is, the crown is feminine, and the head, or more specifically the open mem of the head, is the masculine. Scholem, Origins, p. 60, interprets the open mem as a symbol of the feminine. See also Stern, Parables, p. 221. For discussion of this bahiric parable and the other passages that utilize these images, see Wolfson, “Images,” p. 161. 55. The symbolic implication of the bahiric passage is made explicit in later kabbalistic texts. See, for example, S ema h , S ema hS addiq, 37b: “the covenant is garbed in the secret of the feminine [ hitlabshut ha-berit be-sod ha-neqevah] and then there is rectification of the world [tiqqun ha-olam] and his opening overflows.” 56.

An interesting exception is found in the Sabbatian teaching promulgated by Israel H azzan, disciple of Nathan of Gaza, in his Perush Tehillim, MS Budapest- Kaufmann 255, fol. 110a: In the account of the chariot itself, in the beginning of its existence, there is an allusion to the closed mem, that is, the two h eitin that are joined together and covered by the straight line [qaw ha-yashar] , and they are made like two daltin and two yodin, and the two daltin form a closed mem, that is, the closed door [delet ha-nisggeret] , “This is the gate to the Lord the righteous will enter through it” (Ps 118:20), for to be included in the inner light of each and every world it is necessary to enter through the mem, which consists of the two doors [delatot] , for in the entrance of every sacred edifice [ binyan qodesh] there must be two doors just as there were in the Temple [Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 8a]. Moreover, it says there that it is already known that when the messianic king arrives the lower space [ha- t ehiru ha-ta h ton] will be rectified, and then there will be as in the essence of the beginning of thought the mem closed in the entirety of the withdrawal.

Notably, however, Azriel of Gerona cites this passage together with an allusion to the second aggadic passage in his expansion of the comment of his older colleague, Ezra ben Solomon, on the dictum, attributed alternatively to R. Jeremiah and to R. H iyya bar Abba (Babylonian Talmud, Megillah 2b), that the letters mem, nun, s addi, pe, and kaf — that is, all the letters with closed and open forms—were articulated by the prophets, s ofim, literally, the visionaries. In his commentary on this statement, R. Ezra quipped, “May God open our eyes to comprehend mysteries from his Torah.” Azriel elaborates, “The twenty-two elemental letters and the five double letters all [allude] to the secret of redemp- tion [sod ha-ge’ullah] , and all of them are at the end of the word except for the closed mem in the expression le-marbbeh ha-misrah. ” The connection established between the five double letters and the secret of redemption is based on yet another aggadic tradition cited by Azriel from Pirqei Rabbi Eli‘ezer, ch. 48, 116a. See Perush ha-Aggadot, pp. 49–50, already noted by Liebes, Studies in the Zohar, p. 233 n. 45.

I have translated the verse in accord with the intent of the author of the bahiric passage. The literal rendering of ki im la-binah tiqra is “If you call to under- standing,” but the tacit assumption from the context is that the word im should be read as em, “mother,” and hence the translation “You shall call understand- ing mother.” 69.

Lieberman, op. cit., p. 187, also noted that Tertullian, Adversus Marcionem 3:22, remarked that the tau of Ezekiel was the sign of the cross. So also, in his Homilies on Genesis, Jerome similarly applied the tau of Ezekiel to the sign of the cross, emphasizing the apotropaic effect of this mark by noting that no one inscribed with the tau could be struck by the devil. Jerome’s text is cited in Barry, Greek Qabbalah, p. 140. On the possibility that the letter tau , which in the ancient Hebrew script had the shape of two crossed lines, functioned as a short- hand symbol for the divine name insofar as it is the last letter of the alphabet, see Finegan, Archaeology , pp. 220–260; Gieschen, “Divine Name,” pp. 133– 134. Lastly, it is worth recalling here that the archaic symbolism lived well into the Middle Ages, as we may adduce, for example, from the case of Francis of Assisi, who considered the tau a symbol of redemption and thus worthy of being his order’s coat of arms. See Goffen, Spirituality, pp. 5, 89 – 90 n. 36; Emmerson and Herzman, Apocalyptic Imagination, pp. 46–48, 52–53, 68, and ref- erences to other scholars cited on p. 197 n. 25. 30. The polemical dimension of the rabbinic dicta is developed further by Liebes, Studies in Zohar, pp. 235–237 n. 56. 31. As Oron, “Narrative,” pp. 100 – 101 notes, according to the earlier sources, the case that tau presents before God rests on its standing at the start of the word torah, whereas, according to the Zohar, the case rests on the fact that tau terminates the word emet. The shift underscores that the link between truth and death is paramount in the zoharic text. 32. This is precisely the problem Heidegger deals with in Being and Time, sec. 47, pp. 221–224. The transition from being-there to no-longer-being-there cannot be experienced. Consequently, the experience of one’s own death is accessible only through the death of the other, a point that Heidegger relates to the more general ontic claim that the being of Dasein is a being-with others. The death of the other opens the possibility of experiencing one’s own death as the terminus that constitutes the being of Dasein from the beginning. Heideg- ger insists, however, that death is experienced not as a “being-at-an-end” but as “being toward an end” (ibid., sec. 48, p. 228). On Heidegger’s grappling with the complexity of death and phenomenological representation, see Wood, Deconstruction, pp. 183–188, and the astute remarks of Philipse, Heidegger’s Philoso- phy, pp. 364–365. For a different perspective, which culminates with a Christ- ian interpretation of death as a mystical experience that fully embraces life, see Landsberg, “Experience,” pp. 193–231. 33.

In the editio princeps of the Palestinian Talmud (Venice 1523–24), which was based on the Leiden manuscript copied in 1289, the reading is yhwh elohim, “Lord God.” I have followed the version of the text found in later editions, as the one preserved in the first edition appears to be corrupt. The prooftext cited in this context (see following note), as well as parallels in other rabbinic sources, indicates that the correct reading centers on the exegetical decoding of wa-yhwh, “and the Lord,” as an allusion to God and his supernal court, yhwh u- veit dino. See Genesis Rabbah 51:2, p. 533. It is possible, however, that since the jux- taposition of yhwh elohim likely refers to the combination of mercy and judg- ment, the intent may be equivalent to the cooperation of God and his court encoded in the expression wa-yhwh, that is, yhwh, the attribute of mercy, and beit dino, the court that stands metonymically for the attribute of judgment.

The durability of writing in contrast to oral speech is duly noted by Mar- tin, History, p. 87. It is of interest to note here the comment preserved in Song of Songs Rabbah 1:9 (ed. Dunaski, par. 45, p. 38) in response to the citation of Daniel 10:21, “If it is true [emet] , why is it inscribed [rashum] , and if it is inscribed, why is it written? Rather, prior to the sealing of the judgment, it is inscribed, but after the decree of judgment is sealed, it is true.” 37. Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 104a. 38. Song of Songs Rabbah 1:9 (ed. Dunaski, par. 45, p. 38). 39. This possibility was suggested by Dunaski, op. cit., p. 38 n. 14. 40. Plato, Laws V, 715e, reports an old tradition according to which God is described as holding in his hands “beginning, end, and middle of all that is.” 41. In Revelation 1:17, the statement attributed to Jesus, “I am the first and I am the last,” is a verbatim reiteration of the language of Isaiah 44:6. See also Revelation 21:6 where the alpha and omega are glossed respectively as the beginning and the end. In Revelation 22:13, all three traditions are combined as Jesus is described as the alpha and the omega, the first and the last, the begin- ning and the end. See Bauckham, Theology , pp. 25–28. The influence of the de- piction of God in Isaiah 44:6 is also attested in Qur’ a n 57:3. 42. Further support for this line of thinking may be culled from a remark pre- served in Midrash Mishle, ch. 22, p. 153, regarding the threefold character of the letters of Torah, which comprise the letters of the word emet, alef, mem, and tau. Bracketing the exegetical context wherein this dictum is preserved, we may rec- ognize here an older teaching predicated on the presumed identity of Torah and truth. The truthfulness of Torah is expressed in the three letters of the emet. 43. The threefold nature of truth, related to the three names of God men- tioned in the scriptural confession of monotheism (Deut 6:4) and the rabbinic identification of emet as the seal of God, is a‹rmed in Zohar 3:162a. 44.

For discussion of this still unpublished text, see Scholem, “Eine unbekannte,” pp. 109–123. 70. On occasion, the symbol of the Tree of Life is associated with Yesod, the phallic potency and the ninth emanation. One way or the other, this tree is allied symbolically with the masculine as opposed to the Tree of Knowledge, which is the feminine. 71. In zoharic symbolism, Malkhut is linked symbolically to the Tree of Knowledge, which is identified further as the Tree of Death, based on Seder Eliyyahu Rabbah, p. 24. See Zohar 1:35b; 3:120b; Moses de León, Book of the Pome- granate, p. 83; Scholem, Mystical Shape, pp. 76 and 109; Tishby, Wisdom, pp. 375– 379. 72. In Zohar 3:163b, the scriptural expression ya‘aqov ish tam, “Jacob, an unblemished man” (Gen 25:27), is interpreted symbolically as “the husband of this unblemished one,” ba‘lah deha-hu tam, that is, Tif’eret, consort of Shekhinah. When the masculine potency, which is symbolized by alef, is conjoined to tam, the word that is formed comprises all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, alef the first, mem the middle, and tau the last; these letters spell emet, “truth,” which is the “totality of male and female together” ( kelal dekhar we-nuqba ka- h ada ). See Cor- dovero, Pardes Rimmonim, 23:1, 6d, s.v. emet. 73. On the decoding of emet as a combination of alef and met, see Moses de León, Sefer Or Zaru‘a, p. 255. In that text, presumably composed before the unti- tled fragment extant in MS Munich 47, alef stands for the one God, the source of life for all that exists; if one removes alef from emet, what remains are the let- ters mem and taw, which spell met, “a thing lacking all essence” (davar mufar mi-kol iqqar). 74. Genesis Rabbah 96:5, p. 1196; Midrash Tan h uma, Wayehi, 3. 75. MS Munich 47, fol. 340a: “Thus you can understand that the secret of truth [sod ha-emet] consists of the Written Torah and the Oral Torah, the one con- tained in the other [kalul zeh ba-zeh] , and everything is one matter and an appro- priate secret for the one who understands.” 76. Zohar 1:161b–162a. 77. My language is indebted to the discussion of the Sufi notion of dhu al- ‘ aynayn, “man of two eyes,” in Izutsu, Creation, p. 19. According to Izutsu, the Notes to Pages 170 – 174 259 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 259"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"title refers to one who has realized in the experience of wajd the wa h dat al-wuj u d, the “finding” of being, the oneness of existence, the formless form, hidden under the apparent forms of the phenomenal world of differentiation (farq) . In other words, the binocular vision is the coincidentia oppositorum of the one and the many, the hidden and the revealed, the face and the veil. 78. Zohar 1:190a. 79. In the text attributed to Eybeschuetz, Shem Olam, p. 100, the rabbinic notion that truth is the divine seal ( h otama de-gushppanqa) is interpreted to mean that “truth contains falsehood” (emet kolel sheqer). 80. The discerning ear will hear the traces of Sufi doctrine in my formulation, fan a ’ and baq a ’ , passing and abiding, and the ultimate attainment, fan a ’ al-fan a ’ , the passing of passing, the double negation that is a‹rmation, baq a ’ . The process can be expressed in other images as well, including especially moving from the world of separation (farq) to union ( jam‘) , and then to union of union ( jam‘ al- jam‘) , which is the oneness of all beings experienced through the separation, that is, the coincidence of opposites such that there is no more distinction between union and separation. See Izutsu, Creation, pp. 14–19, and ch. 2 n. 93. Conclusion 1. The locution is based on T. S. Eliot’s remark in “Four Quartets,” in Complete Poems and Plays , p. 120: “Only through time time is conquered.” The fuller con- text of the poem indicates that the conquering of time by time comes about in remembrance of the moment, which comprehends past and future. 2. For a preliminary investigation of the similarity between the kabbalistic ontology of time and the view on temporality articulated by Rosenzweig, see Wolfson, “Facing the Effaced,” pp. 51–63. 3. Rosenzweig, Star of Redemption, p. 420, and see Wolfson, “Facing the Effaced,” pp. 56–57. 4. On Rosenzweig’s conception of the metahistorical status of Judaism, which removes Jews from the turmoils of historical time, see Altmann, “Franz Rosen- zweig,” pp. 194–214; Funkenstein, Perceptions , pp. 120, 253, 291–295. 5. In this matter, one can discern the influence of Nietzsche’s doctrine of the eternal recurrence of the same, which denies the “timeless eternity” of a super- natural being (in the Platonic-Christian tradition) and a‹rms the “eternity of the ever-creating and destroying powers in nature and man.” See Pfeffer, Niet- zsche, pp. 130–131; Strong, Friedrich Nietzsche, pp. 260–293; Sugarman, Rancor Against Time, pp. 56–96; Löwith, Nietzsche’s Philosophy; Lukacher, Time-Fetishes, pp. 7– 8, 116–138. To be sure, in contrast to, and perhaps even as a response to, Nietzsche, Rosenzweig sought to a‹rm the transcendental other, the basis for revelation, which, in turn, legitimates creation and redemption as meaningful theological categories. It is nevertheless the case that the experience of eternity in this world is predicated on a convergence of the same and the different that Notes to Pages 174 – 176 260 Wolfson (V) 12/1/05 2:27 PM Page 260"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"is a crucial aspect of Nietzsche’s doctrine. Moreover, it is not impossible that Nietzsche’s doctrine of the eternal recurrence was itself inspired by and rooted in a personal experience of a mystical nature. See, for example, Gutmann, “ ‘Tremendous Moment,’ ” pp. 838–842. 6. See Braiterman, “Cyclical Motions,” pp. 215–238. The position of Rosen- zweig is well summarized by Levinas, In the Time of the Nations , p. 153: “The ritu- alism of the religious communities, in its periodicity, is lived as a circularity of time. It breaks the linear ‘temporalization’ and delineates the image of a fixed eternity: an eternity that is at once signified and anticipated. The symbolism of the rite is not portrayed as being some deficiency in knowledge, but a surplus, halfway between the signifying of the signified and its accomplishment.” For further elaboration, see Steinkamp, “Eternity and Time,” pp. 207–222. 7. Freund, Philosophy of Existence, pp. 11–12, 184; Gibbs, Why Ethics? pp. 358– 360. Rosenzweig’s perspective on time and eternity accords with the following assessment of Heidegger in Dastur, Heidegger and the Question of Time, p. 5: “If, on the basis of Heidegger’s approach to time, something like eternity is still think- able, it would have an entirely different meaning and be based upon a tempo- rary thought in a more original way. Time can no longer be thought of on the basis of eternity, but, on the contrary, eternity must be thought of on the basis of time.” For an elaboration of this a‹nity, see Gordon, Rosenzweig and Heidegger, pp. 185–205. 8. Kierkegaard, Concept of Anxiety, p. 206. 9. The gloss on the rabbinic eschatological idiom “world-to-come” as the “world that came” is found in Sefer ha-Bahir. See Bahir, § 106, p. 191. The passage is discussed above in chapter 4. 10. Blake, Complete Poetry, p. 198. 11. Benjamin, Walter Benjamin: Selected Writings, pp. 15–16. On Benjamin’s rejec- tion of a progressive view of history and the implied linear conception of time, see Tiedmann, “Historical Materialism,” pp. 175–209, esp. 176–181.
