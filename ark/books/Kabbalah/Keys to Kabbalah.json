His boo k has circulated in a limi ted circle of students thus far, one of the reasons being the non-sensational approach of the a uthor respecting Kabbalah. The teac hings of the Kabbalah form an integral part of the so-called Hermetic tradition (encompassing areas of study such as kabbalah, tarot, alchemy, astrology, etc.). This tradition h as long been an influential factor behind the scenes in Western civilization and is currently gaining g round and g etting the a ttention it deserves. It seemed a goo d idea to me to make Dr. Bain's research on the Kaballah available to the student in this field, especially since his work contains valuable new insights pertaining to the tree of life in relation to the 21 stages and 32 p aths of wisdom, culmi nating in h is diagram called \" Jacob's ladd er \". The old Kabbalistic doctrine of emanations is clearly illustrated in this diagram and elaborated up on in the text. Also, this boo k may provide a key to you for charting your own progress on the spiritual path. Dr. Alan Bain h as s tudied, taught, and p racticed Kabbalistic teac hings for over thirty y ears and has consented to my request to publish his boo k on the world wide web. He is also o ne of the founders of Theosoph y Internationa l (TI), a new organization that promotes the study, comparison, and p ractice of the various esoteric teac hings and traditions that currently exist in this world. One of these practices is to rephrase old ideas from the wisdom-tradition ( known under various names) into modern language a nd concepts. Without the e xistence of TI this electronic e dition might not have seen the light, as I came to know Alan b etter through h is work for this organization. It is my hope that the students of ~Keys to Kabbalah~ will be a ble to expand their understanding of Kaballah, of matters of the spirit, through a serious s tudy of Dr. Bain's boo k.

The teac hings derived from this s ource have helped many students to understand human n ature a nd their relationship with the spiritual dimension. Much of this teac hing included d eliberate \"mysteries\" which led many students to believe that some a reas are for ever beyond human knowledge. As far back as the late Nineteen-fifties, it beca me c lear that the subject was misrepresented. This was beca use, as well as the \"mysteries\" mentioned, the teac hing incorporated inconsistencies which led naturally to conclusions not borne out by experience. This inspired loo king more deeply into the matter, and the results of some nearly forty y ears of work are now freely available. Originally completed in 1977 , this work has circulated mostly to a few students in sections and in manuscript form, partly for lack of funds, and p artly due to the reluctance of publishers to move away from the tried and tested \"safe\" - and u sually \"sensational\" type of work (such as \"How to make your numbers and stars work for you improve your love/sex life make you rich and able to live forever in your astral body without having to leave this one that will remain forever young send $25 p er jar.\") As a basis for research, it was nece ssary to go back to what are believed to be the first published d issertations on the subject, namely the Sepher Yetzirah (or Boo k of Formation) and the text known as the Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom . From these beginnings, it has been possible to build up a c onsistent scheme which does not"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"incorporate a n embarrassing number of \"mysteries\" and which can b e verified by personal experience. Beca use there a re readers who are being introduced to Kabbalah for the first time in these pages, it is nece ssary to start at the beginning with some e lementary definitions famili ar to students of any schoo l of Kabbalah. The differences in the a rrangement presented later will not, therefore, become apparent until these prelimi naries have been disposed of. From that point on, however, it will be found that the teac hing p rogresses naturally into areas which have previously been considered enigmatic or paradoxical and thence to an exposition of \"Jacob's Ladder\" (Genesis) which n ot only incorporates \"ten Sephiroth and not nine, ten and not eleven\" ( Sepher Yetzirah ) but also consists of thirty-two paths (32 Paths of Wisdom) with n o serious inconsistencies or paradoxes whatever. The keys to the Holy Kabbalah, a path of Knowledge, Wisdom and Understanding, lie in the texts already mentioned, The Thirty Two Paths of Wisdom and Sepher Yetzirah . A most servicea ble translation of the former is made by A.E. Waite in h is boo k The Holy Kabba lah, and this version is used here in conjunction with the text of Sepher Yetzirah . In the diagram of the Ladder delineated in Part Three, these thirty two paths are presented acc ording to the principle of the \"lightning flash\" and in doing so reveal ten Sephiroth. \"Ten and not nine; ten and not eleven.\" At the same time, the Tree of Life is unfolded in eac h of the four Worlds of Kabbalah, prece ded by three veils of \"negative existence\" and culmi nating in the Malkuth of Assiah. With the keys now in place , the diagram of the Ladder becomes a mine of Kabbalistic information and is, at the same time, a c omplete e xposition of Kabbalist teac hing. For those whose understanding of the subject is s mall, there is an introduction to the basic general principles of Kabbalah and its roo t doctrine of the ten Sephiroth. Attributions of the Tarot In Parts Two and Three, there is frequent reference to the 22 \"Trumps\" of the Tarot. Such attributions as have been used have not been included in all of the diagrams. This is beca use they can b e used on at least three levels, and the simplicity of diagrams would become unnece ssarily complicated by the a ddition of too many texts, figures, numbers and the like. For reference purposes, all attributions, of which the Tarot is a major source, are tabulated at the e nd of the series, apart from those found illustrating the twenty one stages of the Way, included in Part Two. The Tarot illustrations in Part Three a re from a primi tive source much older than those used in Part Two, and help to explain why two cards re-numbered by Waite have had the original numbering restored. On the use of Tarot cards generally, two things need to be said. First, their main value lies in their being an aid to understanding. They have no intrinsic merit in themselves. The mystique of the ca rds lies only in their ability to arouse a response in the observer. In themselves, they are piece s of card with pictures on them. As an aid to understanding, it is the picture which is important. The titles comm only"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"given to, or found on the ca rds are principally for convenience a s a means of identification. Early packs have no such titles (as is s een in the Part Three illustrations). STAR T HERE ... The word Kabbalah is derived from a Hebrew w ord meaning \"to rece ive,\" and Kabbalah is a teac hing rece ived. Its origins, like other simil ar doctrines, are obscure. It is enough for our purpose to say that its first outward appearance seems to have occurred du ring the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Since then, a tremendous amount of superstructure has reared itself upon the Teac hing from Christians, mystics, astrologers and the like. This can only be tested by study and experience. We a re therefore c ompelled to take it as we find, and to test its validity for ourselves. It is not essential [though interesting] to establish origins, for if what we a re taught makes s ense in terms of our experience, then for us it is valid u ntil further experience e ither confirms or denies it. Therefore, Kabbalah is given h ere a s rece ived, without placing u nnece ssary emphasis on `from whom' or from where. Like a ll such systems, Kabbalah seeks to lead to Self knowledge a mong those who use it. It attempts to provide a nswers to the riddles of the universe a nd the riddles of humanity. This it does, in part, by likening the one to the other\" saying, \"that which is above is like unto that which is below.\" In terms of the \"above,\" it sets forth a description of the basic laws of the world or the universe, and works its way, step by step, to individual human b eings and their various s tates of awareness. It is a c omprehensive system, and is s o constructed that it can readily absorb into itself other teac hings and p hilosophies without losing anything of its own character. In fact it gains from this. The Tree of Life The basis of Kabbalah is a diagram called the Tree of Life. It consists of a representation of ten spheres or regions s ystematically arranged to illustrate the patterns and relationships of things. The most important thing about this diagram is that it illustrates the doctrine of emanations, by which eac h sphere e manates its succe ssor, without losing anything of itself, so that the first sphere is s aid to contain all those below it in order of creation. Simil arly, it is s aid that the last sphere c ontains all those a bove it in the order of creation."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"These ten spheres are ca lled the ten Sephiroth , a Hebrew w ord meaning numbers, or better, numerations, the singular of which is Sephira. The first Sephira is called Kether, which means Crown, and may be c onsidered as representative of the Infinite Source of all things. From the ac tivity of this s ource emanates ' Hokma, Wisdom, which, while being a separate sphere, is nonetheless still part of Kether; and Kether, although h aving emanated ' Hokma, has lost nothing of itself. ' Hokma in turn emanates Binah, Understanding, which in turn causes to be e manated ' Hesed, Mercy; Geburah, Strength; Tiphareth, Beauty; Netzac h, Victory; Hod, Glory; Yesod, Foundation; and Malkuth, Kingdom. Kabbalah is a Hebrew system which h as been developed and expanded by Christians and others. The important thing, however, is not how it has developed but what it is capable of bringing to its s tudents. It is s uited p articularly for those seeking an increase of awareness, Self-knowledge a nd Self-realisation. The Four W orlds The ten Sephiroth exist in what are ca lled the Four Worlds. This means that Kabbalah distinguish b etween four states of being, from the most abstract and spiritual to the most dense a nd material. Rather like the Sephiroth, the Four Worlds depend from eac h other, but in a different manner. The first of the Four Worlds or levels is called Atziluth, or the World of Emanation. Here, creative force is s eeking expression, but lacks form. In Atziluth, the Divine Source takes the first steps towards creation. If we think of this in terms of the c reation of the world, then drawing a parallel with Genesis we ca n say: \"In the beginning the Earth was without form and void, and d arkness was upon"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God (or \"the gods\") moved up on the face of the waters.\" Atziluth, then, is pure spirit beginning to take its first movements towards creative expression. It is that region where a ll potential lies, from where may come anything we may learn h ow to bring into expression, or that may be brought into expression b y divine ac tivity or \"Holy Spirit.\" In Kabbalah, we try to make our actions and operations come into line with this divine ac tivity, or LAW. The next World in order is called Briah, and is described as the World of Creation. It is the region where the basic plans for the objects of creation h ave their beginning. From Genesis again: \"And God said 'Let there be light,' and there was light. And God saw the light that it was goo d; and God d ivided the light from the darkness. If there were no light or darkness we should be unable to perceive a nything, whether of light we measure in wavelengths, or of spiritual light when the word is used another way. In Briah are the the seeds - and only the seeds - of differentiation. In terms of human psychology, here lie the roo ts of mind, the raw material from which ideas and ideals are born. It is not until we reac h the World of Yetzirah, or the World of Formation, that form, produced through force, begins to take on recognisable shape. In this region, everything that takes place ca n present an image to the mind. Symbols, as distinct from the words which describe them, are of great value, for they can convey concepts which, if we tried to think about them i n an ordinary sequential manner might take days to formulate. An excellent example of this is the Tree of Life itself. It makes no difference whether an image invoked in the mind is of an object, perhaps remembered, or if it is pure fantasy. For this reason Yetzirah, where in h uman terms, all is s een in the form of image a nd symbol, is the most dangerous of the Four Worlds, for here fantasy is almost as real as the record of facts held in the memory. To complicate matters, it is at this level that we mostly \"live a nd move a nd have our being\" in real terms: another way of saying that we spend most of our waking lives in a perpetual round of fantasies and mental im aginings, often h ardly noticing our physical surroundings at all. This will help explain why, in Christian terminology, the world of Yetzirah equates with Purgatory - not a place to which we go after death to be \"punished\" for our crimes, but a world in which we live right now, and in which we need to \"purge\" or purify our lives. It is in this world that most of the work of the Kabbalist takes effect. Kabbalah h elps us to distinguish b etween that which is real and that which is not. From there we ca n b egin to build a real place for ourselves in a real world, and to become real people. The last of the four Worlds is called Assiah, the material world, related to the Klippo th , or shells. In Assiah, all the ac tivity of the previous three Worlds finds its expression in material activity, or material objects. It is also the world of appearances, for all things in Assiah contain within them the three worlds prece ding it, hence the idea of shells, or containers. That includes us . It is Assiah with which we a re nece ssarily the most famili ar, and in which we seek to create"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"order. We often fail in this, since for there to be order in Assiah, it must first be conceived in Atziluth. In other words, there ca n b e no harmony in the world unless we recognise therein the ac tivity of the divine influence, the Holy Spirit, or presence of 'God' - YH WH - \"That-which-is,\" or \"Eternal Being.\" 1. KET HER ( \u0000\u0002\u0001\u0002\u0003 \u0000\u0002\u0001\u0002\u0003 ) ( Crown ) There is little that can b e said about Kether, for acc ording to tradition, those who reac h it do not return to tell us of their experience. Kether is, for us, unknowable, but we may nevertheless s peculate c oncerning it, and we may attempt to describe it by saying what it is not. Kether is Eternity, an idea e xpressed by its other titles, The Ancient of Ancients, the Ages of Ages and the Ancient of Days. We a re acc ustomed to think of eternity as an infinite e xtension of time. Eternity, as symbolised by Kether, is the c omplete a bsence of time. In Kether, time is not. Kether also represents the goal of all things. Time, like the things of life, is an illusion ; a reflection. Being as we a re, it is obvious that any spiritual condition of the nature of Kether is impossible of realisation. While we a re in the body, we a re subject to, and limi ted by, time. To exist and function in Kether, we should need a form - or lack of one - where the c onditions of time did not apply. There a re, however, in v arious ways, conditions which approximate to Kether. To explain this, it is nece ssary to introduce the idea of scale. It is possible to draw the Tree of Life in such a way as to give a separate Tree in eac h of the Four Worlds (which is seen in the breakdown of the Ladder in Part Three). Beca use of variations at different levels, it is essential to distinguish in the mind up on which scale we a re working, and not to mix one with another, except insofar as \"that which is above is like unto that which is below.\" (Like unto it - not the same as it). If we a ttempt to compare the a ttributes of Kether on different scales, there may be, at first glance, little that seems to connect them. At one e nd of the scale is the Ancient of Days - a description of YH WH, or '91God'. Further down the scale we find the divine spark in eac h h uman b eing. Both concepts may be referred to Kether. The Ancient of Days is like a remote a nd elevated deity who has the power of life a nd death over not only humans, but over whole worlds, galaxies, or even the Universe in its entirety, whatever that may be. The divine spark in ourselves, which can b e described as the purest part of our being, is the factor which makes us human. Without it we a re governed entirely by sense e xperience. It may seem that there a re many people who are e xactly like this. How closely do we, as individual human b eings, stand examination? W hat makes us s o special if we have no such divine spark? The a nswer is that we do, but are not nece ssarily aware of its existence. Kabbalah teac hes that we a re in human form for the purpose of learning that we a re so endowed, and to grow and develop by learning to bring the ac tivity of Yechidah, or spirit, into the e xperience of life, discovering self-knowledge a nd self-realisation as we do so. A little thought shows that the two correspondences given h ave something very basic in comm on. Without the \"Ancient of Days\" the world could not exist. And"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"without the divine spark in ourselves, we, as we a re, could not exist. Consider that the search for self-realisation is in three stages, which can b e described as: 1. Know Yourself. 2. Understand Yourself. 3. Be Yourself. In the sense that these terms are used, it would be foo lish to assume that we have nece ssarily begun to do even the first of these three, although it is a goo d thing to attempt to be ourselves always, as best we may. Most people seem to be dominated by one of the four psychological functions described by Jung: Thinking, Feeling, Sensation and Intuition. If we a re to break the ties which b ind, we must set our sights upon Kether, not some intermediate stage, for those who wish to fly to the moo n cannot hope to succee d if they make their calculations for a point somewhere a long the way. It is in this light that we need to approach the study of Kabbalah if our study is to be practical, and this light is a spiritual one. Kether represents the Holy of Holies, whatever this expression may mean to whoever uses it, for which reason one Kabbalistic organization exhorted its members not to blaspheme the name by which others know their god. No matter what our level of understanding, or from what level we a pproach, there is always a Kether which for us is unattainable. In any theology, God is nece ssarily omnipotent and omniscient, for God is always the Crown of Creation, Kether, which, in the words of Path Ten of the 32 Paths of Wisdom, \"is exalted above every head\" (as the Kether of the World of Briah). 2. 'HOK MA ( \u0004\u0002\u0005\u0007\u0006\t\b \u0004\u0002\u0005\u0002\u0006\t\b ) (W isdom) In ' Hokma, the source of all being in Kether has begun to move in the direction of manifestation. As with Kether, there is not much we ca n say concerning this sphere e xcept by analogy. Let us consider , if we ca n, infinite power in infinite motion in infinite space . This may give some idea of the nature of ' Hokma. Also, we need to remember that at this level there is no such thing as time, for the conditions of limi tation n ece ssary for its existence have yet to appear. ' Hokma is undifferentiated force, whereas Kether is undifferentiated p otential. In ' Hokma, this potential begins to move, begins to be realised, but unless it is limi ted in some way, unless it can b e c ircumscribed or contained, nothing may be c reated, nothing will become manifest. A goo d analogy for ' Hokma is electrical energy. While much is known about this force, all that we know is known only beca use we a re able to trap its energy by various means. We know, for example, that radio waves are ca rried continuously through the a ir, but we a re unable to make use of them unless we a re a ble to build an instrument to confine them and to channel them i n a way that may be of service, as we do with a radio rece iver. In a sense, then, although we may consider ' Hokma a s total power in total m otion, this power is equally impotent, beca use being infinitely distributed through eternal infinity, its pressure is equal in all directions ..... We ca n get a glim pse of the significance of ' Hokma when we regard it as the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"Supernal Father,\" as it is s ometimes called, or the fundamental m ale principle. In doing so, we shall see how analogies with h uman sexuality are useful in understanding the mysteries of Kabbalah. The human male is in a simil ar position to ' Hokma, for like the Sephira, he bears within h im the seeds that may beget life, but if this s eed is dispersed outside the body, then n o life form can b e c reated. The human male seed has to be c ontained within the human female a nd combined with her seed. Even then, many further processes are nece ssary before there ca n b e a human child. Analogously, the e nergy potential of the Supernal Father has to be contained within the Supernal Mother, Binah, before c reation proper can comm ence; equally, there a re further processes to be undergone before this creation can b ecome manifest, before the spiritual child is born. Here, as with all the Sephiroth, we ca n see a universal Law of being applying to all things at all levels, from galaxies to geraniums. 3. BINA H ( \u0002\u000b\r\f\r\u000e \u0007\u000b\r\f\r\u000e ) ( Understand ing ) When we reac h the Sephira Binah, we begin to be in a position to describe some recognisable c onditions, although we a re still dealing with b asic principles. One of the symbols for Kether is the point, which in pure mathematics has no dimension. A simil ar symbol for ' Hokma is the straight line, which h as length b ut no width. The relevant symbol for Binah is the triangle, and here we ca n see via the symbolism that the impulse towards creation b egins to be c onfined, in the same way as the space within the triangle is confined. Binah h as been called the Supernal Mother, and we ca n see how this principle complements and balances the operation of the Supernal Father, ' Hokma. We ca n also see that the a nalogies with h uman sexuality mentioned when describing ' Hokma a re in acc ord with the symbolism. In Binah we a re getting closer to principles which we ca n understand in a more material sense. Indeed, this Sephira has s trong associations with the tenth Sephira, Malkuth, which represents the manifest creation as we see it. The principle that is Binah, Understanding, is the principle in everything at all levels which confines and contains within definite limi ts, as the space is confined within the three sides of the triangle. Hence the title, Understanding, for to understand anything we must be a ble to contain it within some frame of reference. Understanding is made up of two words, \"standing\" and \"under.\" In this s ense, Binah stands under the two Sephiroth prece ding it, and rece ives from them the influence which it is able to contain, confine, and p reserve. In astrology, Binah is associated with the planet Saturn, which h as s imil ar attributes. We ca n see how Binah acts like a rece ptacle for the e nergies of the other two Supernal Sephiroth. There is a relationship here with the ninth Sephira, Yesod, Foundation, also called \"the rece ptacle of the e manations\" due to its position on the Tree of Life. In this illustration we ca n also see that eac h Sephira below Kether is thus the source from which the Sephiroth b elow it are brought into being. This is even true of Kether itself, for it is condensed from out of the non-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"substance of the Great Unmanifest, and is itself subject to the law of emanation. Binah is the Supernal Mother, the Great Mother of ancient religion and modern depth psychology alike. For imm ediate practical purposes it represents the highest level of principle that we, as incarnate human b eings, may appreciate. Binah, though, is on the far side of an Abyss, and we ca n therefore never fully realise the nature of this Sephira while in the flesh. Fortunately, we a re nonetheless able to make some c ontact with this level at advanced stages of practical work by virtue of the link which arises between the Supernal Sephiroth on the Tree of Life a nd those below them. This link is called Daath , Knowledge, sometimes considered for convenience a s another, _93 invisible\" Sephira, more properly explained elsewhere. Here we may simply say that Daath, as a Sephira, does not exist. The path of the Lightning flash procee ds directly from Binah to ' Hesed, the fourth Sephira, without interruption in its journey. As Daath is s ometimes portrayed in the ce ntre of the Abyss, we shall describe the significance of Daath b efore going on to the remaining Sephiroth in the order of their emanation. ( Daath is s hown as the dotted circle in the diagram of the Tree) DAA TH ( \u000f\u0002\u0010\u0007\u0011 \u000f\u0002\u0010\u0002\u0011 ) ( Knowledge ) Daath cannot in any sense be c onsidered as a Sephira on the Tree of Life. It does not emanate from any other, nor does it cause a nything to be e manated in its turn. Its s ignificance lies in the position assigned to it. Daath means knowledge, and has significance only as a function of consciousness - but it is present only to consciousness developing up wards towards the higher principles. On a different scale, it is the point of contact between those who work within the world of appearances - in groups and societies for example - and what has been described as the \"inner planes.\" This term can b e misleading, but so can any terminology which seeks to describe the non-material aspects of creation, of life, being, and consciousness itself. That there is a reality to these \"inner planes,\" in b eyond reasonable doubt to those with sufficient experience, but it is no kind of reality or objectivity as we a re acc ustomed to experience the same. Not a great deal can b e said about Daath at this point, except that it is the point of knowledge via which hidden teac hings are rece ived. It may for practical purposes be c onsidered as a function of the Sephira Tiphareth, and yet has many Binah qualities and attributes. At the same time, it is the Throne of Binah to the developing consciousness. It is best understoo d in the light of the \"subjective\" Sephiroth in connection with the Ladder in Part Three. 4. 'H ESED ( \u0012\u0002\u0013\t\u0014 \u0012\u0007\u0013\t\u0014 ) ( Mercy ) The fourth Sephira is the highest level we ca n ordinarily reac h without special disciplines. The planet Jupiter is assigned to this s phere. In astrology, it is the planet governing religion and p hilosophy. For our study, more is required than"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"ordinary religion or philosophy can provide. In its representation of basic principles, ' Hesed refers to the very beginnings of manifestation that we ca n knowingly understand. The triangle of Binah h as no depth, and cannot therefore symbolise a nything p roperly material, being only two-dimensional, whereas creation as we see it is three-dimensional. In ' Hesed we ca n add an apex above the triangle, forming a triangular pyramid illustrating the possibility of movement within space a s we understand such movement. In so doing we have a lso introduced time a nd du ration. Here we have the ground p lan of creation made manifest. Here lie the roo ts of nature a nd of natural law. ' Hesed is the principle from which these roo ts and this law derive their origin. If we c onsider the triangular based p yramid as made of glass, like a bottle, but with n o o pening, we can imagine that the bottle fills with water, but from within itself, in a way we cannot fathom, due to the influence of the three prece ding Sephiroth, by way of emanation. The principle of limi tation established in Binah is now at work, for the bottle ca n only contain as much water as its form allows. At this level, however, we a re still dealing very much with abstract principles of emanation, later to become manifest in Malkuth. Our bottle's dimensions are still those of infinity. Within this bottle only is there such a thing as time, as we understand time, and it is within this bottle that all li fe subject to limi tation h as its origin and its being. The bottle that is ' Hesed is of infinite size, and of infinite duration. (Usually rendered \"Mercy,\" ' Hesed can a lso mean \" Benevolence\" and \" Charity.\") 5. GEB URA H ( \u0015\u0007\u0016\u0002\u0017\r\u0018\u0002\u0019 \u0015\u0002\u0016\u0002\u0017\r\u0018\u0002\u0019 ) ( Strength ) This principle may be c onsidered as the force which motivates to activity. It is not the ac tivity itself, but the power which lies behind it. In ' Hokma we described the principle of undifferentiated energy. Here, that energy has been confined by the third Sephira Binah, and transformed into potential by the a dditional dimension developed by ' Hesed. In Geburah energy is s et in motion subject to the limi ts imposed by the principles emanated before itself. If we c onsider the a nalogy of a car engine, we ca n obtain an idea of the importance of Geburah. The idea of being, i.e., that there ca n b e such a thing as the e ngine, stems from Kether. The potential to drive it derives from ' Hokma. The principle of confining this energy to put it to practical use is provided by Binah, and the idea of the form i t will take is established in ' Hesed. Geburah represents the principle of this energy in controlled motion, motion controlled by the ac tivity of the other four principles. It does not in any way refer to the means of operating the e ngine, such as the fuel, or the spark which ignites it. It is the principle which contains the nece ssary energy to drive the ca r. The mechanics come later. Geburah represents the principle of energy in controlled motion for particular purposes, whatever they may be. Therefore the principle that we ca ll Geburah , Strength, is true for such motion at all levels, whether it be the ca r engine, the revolution of the world on its axis, the power behind g alactic motion or that behind human desires, all of which b y virtue of Geburah are driven to perform varying k inds of activity. In astrology it is"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"referred to Mars, the god of war - very much a business of controlled energy, with its creation of armies, weapons, and the means of delivering that energy for particular purposes, to particular targets. Geburah is the throbbing at the heart of all things that are. 6. TIPHAR ET H ( \u001a\u0002\u001b\u0002\u001c\u0002\u001d\u0002\u001a \u001a\u0002\u001b\u0002\u001c\u0007\u001d\u0002\u001a ) ( Beauty ) This Sephira is, for us, the most significant on the Tree of Life, and one of the most difficult to describe. In astrology it is represented by the Sun, the ce ntre of our own solar system, and Tiphareth may be regarded as the ce ntre which h olds the other Sephiroth together in a simil ar manner. In Tiphareth all conflict may be reconciled, all seeming contradictions resolved. Tiphareth is the principle of manifest being. To avoid confusion, we must remember that it is manifest being which is being referred to; absolute being is a quality of Kether and the unmanifest which prece des it. Without Tiphareth, all the principles of form and energy which have gone before ca n come to nothing. The knowledge of force a nd the understanding of form cannot of themselves cause a nything to become manifest in creation. In order for there to be knowledge there has to be one who may know; for understanding, one who may understand. There has to be finite being. Tiphareth represents the principle of manifest being itself, at all levels, be it the individual human b eing, about whom we understand so little, the being at the centre of the universe, or at the heart of the pebbles on a beac h. Tiphareth is the heart of all true religion, for it is the lower representative of Eternal Being, the life of which flows like a c oo l stream through all that lives. If Kether is God unmanifest, Tiphareth is God manifest. In us it is the individual soul, also called the Self. Tiphareth is the soul of all things. Kether is the Spirit of all things, and Yesod, the Foundation, together with Malkuth, the tenth and final Sephira, representing the outward appearance, is the body of all things. 7. NET ZAC H ( \u001e \u001f\u0002! \u001e \u001f\u0007! ) ( \" Victory \") In ' Hesed we c onsidered the ground p lan of creation; in this Sephira we a re concerned with the principles which enable the plan to take particular forms, acc ording to the functions of the different departments of manifest creation. Where the Sephiroth including and above Tiphareth relate in eac h instance to o ne principle or law, those below Tiphareth all have to do with these same principles engaged in diversification of activity. If we think of ' Hesed in terms of our own world, then the ground p lan of this will consist of many things whose e xistence, or potential existence, is implicit in that plan. Netzac h is imm ediately below ' Hesed on the Tree of Life, and may be c onsidered as a reflection of it. In Netzac h, the principle is that which separates out the various elements in the ground p lan and prepares them for actively manifesting the forms of life. In the human b eing this principle is related to o ur feelings about things, people a nd situations. Observation"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"of our own experience will show that our feelings act in just such a manner, and perform j ust such a function. There is a c ontinuous s equence of activity in eac h of us which does not cea se from birth to death, waking or sleeping. We a re not normally aware of this nor do we need to be, except at such times as we need to understand what we a re, and how w e work. In astrology it is related to the planet Venus, and our first reac tion to any situation or event is a feeling one. That is to say that our feelings are a roused - or not, which is the other side of the same c oin. Feelings s timulate thoughts, and thoughts motivate ac tion, which changes the c ircumstances. To these c hanged circumstances we then reac t with suitably modified feelings, and so the process continues, even in dreams. We may see that there is a c onstant diversification and adjustment taking p lace within us that is related to o ur desires and ambitions. The Sephira Netzac h represents this principle a t several levels - diversification and adjustment based on whatever ground p lan is appropriate to the level of action concerned. Some Kabbalists have described Netzac h as a Sephira of repetition , a view w hich expresses well the c ircular nature of the inner human activity just described. 8. HO D ( \"\u0002#\r$ \"\u0002#\r$ ) (\" Glory \") The diversification spoken of in connection with Netzac h is a process which continues and becomes more refined in the Sephira Hod. Here differentiation is taken a stage further into classification and arrangement. Most important of all is that with the development of this principle the separate, differentiated p arts of the manifestation of spirit originating in Kether begin to become a utonomous. In Hod they are given the vital energies, as distinct from the principle of energy in Geburah , which are a ppropriate to, and nece ssary for them to become finally expressed in Malkuth , the Kingdom, as distinct forms of life different from eac h other, although eac h acc ording to its type, or ground p lan. This is s o whether that form be a nimate or inanimate. When parts of a fundamental unity become separated in this way, the only manner by which they may eac h recognise or rediscover their comm on origin is by some form of comm unication of one part with another. At the same time a s the principle of Hod separates and g ives life, so nece ssarily does it provide a means of comm unication b etween the parts, establishing p otential relationships for all forms of life, one with another, as well as with the c omm on life which is the heritage of them all. In astrology it is represented by the planet Mercury. 9. YESOD ( \"\u0002%\u0002& \"\u0007%\u0002& ) ( Founda tion ) Yesod is the principle which represents in the downward d evelopment of the Tree of Life a s the foundation of all forms of manifest life. It is the principle of body. All forms of life a re c ontained within a particular type of form acc ording to their"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"natures, and Yesod is the principle of this form-giving qu ality. It is not the body of things as we a re acc ustomed to seeing them, as all we e ver see ordinarily is the outward appearance of that body, the surface of it. Yesod represents the totality of body, from the smallest atom outwards. For the same reason, it also represents the motivating p rinciple imm ediately behind all activity, and like the body, is a continual reservoir of potential m otion and action, awaiting only the nece ssary stimulus. The principle of Yesod is, of itself, inert, and d oes not initiate a nything of its own, being an entirely self-contained p rinciple devoted to maintaining a condition appropriate to the particular form, the particular type of body, so that when it is required to be ac tive in some way it is ready so to behave. We may think of it as a highly present, differentiated p rinciple, localised in eac h particular form of life, containing within itself all the nece ssary potential for behaviour and activity inherent in all the principles that have gone before. Vibrant with energy, very much alive, it is prepared for whatever is required. In the human b eing it governs the ac tion of reflex, whether automatic bodily reflex, or conditioned reflex installed through the e ffect of events upon the personality as a whole. Beca use it rece ives the e nergies of all the prece ding p rinciples or Sephiroth, and holds them i n readiness for the c onsumm ation of their final expression in Malkuth, it is called by Kabbalists the rece ptacle of the e manations, and is represented in astrology by the Moo n. 10. MALKUTH ( '\u0007(\r) *,+ '\u0002(\r) *,+ ) Malkuth is called \"Kingdom.\" It is here that the ac tivity of the nine Sephiroth prece ding it takes s hape, where the manifest creation to which we have been referring continually is seen to be manifest. We a re told by tradition that Malkuth is a \"fallen\" Sephira, and that therefore its position as s hown on diagrams of the Tree of Life is not as it should be. We ca n appreciate this to a degree when we consider that in the position of following Yesod it can only act in a very limi ted manner, acting in a simil ar way for manifestation as the Sephira Binah acts in principle. It represents in this place the principle which contains and confines the energies of the Sephira Yesod, giving them a means of activity. It is also related here to the World of Klippoth, or shells. The principle of Malkuth at this level represents the surface of the body referred to in Yesod ; how a thing appears from its outward appearance. It is the surface of things, the shell which contains the elements which make up the body of things in Yesod , classified and arranged in Hod, differentiated in Netzac h , given independent life in Tiphareth , based on controlled d rives from Geburah , following the ground p lan of ' Hesed , which is contained within the framework of such a plan b y the limi ting action of Binah , which regulates the undifferentiated energies of ' Hokma derived from the need of Spirit in Kether to become manifest. Malkuth is also called the Bride, and it is s aid of the Bride that she has to be redeemed, so as to take her rightful place upon the Throne of Binah. This redemption is the way of Kabbalah, and the work of the Kabbalist. It is interesting to note that the Hebrew title, Malkuth , has, in the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"original language, a feminine plural ending, which illustrates very well the proper sense of the term, for as physical inhabitants of this Malkuth we ca ll \"Planet Earth,\" we a re a ll shells or wombs in which may be born the e xpression of the One Life, the Eternal Unity, which seeks to make of eac h one of us a 'rece ptacle of the emanations.' PAR T T WO THE 21 STAGES DEPICTE D BY THE T AR OT We have now described briefly the development of the Tree of Life from Kether (1) to Malkuth (10). With these basic principles to guide us, we ca n attempt to describe a journey in awareness portrayed as a return path from Malkuth to Kether. This begins in Malkuth and follows through 22 stages. As one is a stage of preparation, we speak in practice of 21. Here we describe the return journey as far as is practical for us, which is as far as the place of Daath. These may be described as s even steps, one for eac h Sephira from Yesod to Daath. (On the higher scale of the Ladder it is s een see that as we reac h a stage of genuine knowledge - as distinct from theory - eac h Daath or Knowledge stage is transformed into a Yesod or Foundation stage for the next level or world above). In the 21 Stages, we ca n see from the diagram that before we move on from eac h stage to the next, we first loo k back and consolidate the work that we have done so far, completing the various triangles which connect the Sephiroth. Broadly speaking, stages which fall directly on particular Sephiroth represent definite levels of awareness, in the same way that the Sephiroth represent definite principles. The paths which connect them represent the ac tivity of that awareness in its development. (The whole arrang ement of the 21 stages properly belong s in the world o f Yetzirah on the scale of the Ladd er as delineated in Part Three. The significance of this canno t be over-empha sised). To reiterate what has been said elsewhere, the four worlds have a direct correspondence in the Christian tradition, which may be e xpressed thus: Heaven ( Atziluth); Paradise ( Briah); Purgatory ( Yetzirah) ; and Hades ( Assiah). If we choo se to equate Hades with Hell, as is s ometimes done, then is this not an acc urate description of the world in which we find ourselves? The c lassic descriptions of “Hell” leap out at us every day from our newspapers and television screens. We ca ll it “The News.” Who is to blame for the e vil conditions and events which continually take place ? The a trocities and horrors of this or that war in this or that part of the world? The rape a nd torture of women and children? The e ver-increasing ability of human beings to devise “better” ways and means of inflicting the greatest possible a gony upon eac h other? W hat kind of God, many people a sk, created such a world for us to inhabit? The a nswer is, or course, that no kind of God d id any such thing. We have"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"created these c onditions ourselves, and it is our responsibility to change them. For eac h one of us, the only change we ca n make practically is a c hange within ourselves. It is easy to see that this or that world leader, dictator, politician, political m ovement, etc., is to blame for this or that condition or sequence of events. It may be that the blame we so readily apportion truly belongs where we allocate it, but allocating b lame does not chang e things. As long as there a re human b eings ready to perpetuate such evil, and other human b eings who are willing to allow it to take place then it will continue a s it has done for centuries. If we a re honest with ourselves as individuals, we will acknowledge a nd recognise that we a ll, eac h one of us - and especially ME - has the ca pacity for evil, possibly as great as the most evil person in h istory. If we have a ny hope a t all of changing the world order, then the first and most practical place to begin is on our own doo rstep, that is with ourselves. This, acc ording to the Teac hing, is the work which we eac h undertake in the world of Yetzirah, of Purgatory, of Purification. One way of depicting this work is s hown b y means of the 21 stages."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The a rrangement outlined here differs from works based on the teac hings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and its derivatives. Any method, however, that is based on the Tree of Life will show a progression in reverse order of the “lightning flash,” a s the present arrangement does with the Foo l of the Tarot. The 21 stages do not attempt to show a progression into the highest spiritual levels. This is due to the relative position of the 21 stages on the larger scale of the Ladder, to be delineated in Part Three. They go, in fact, as far as the “ Daath” of Yetzirah, which then b ecomes the “ Yesod” or Foundation of the world of Briah, Creation, or Paradise. The value of this is that it provides a practical guide to those who wish to chart their own progress without the nece ssity of consulting self-styled Masters or Adepts. Another advantage is that it is most practical to begin with an arrangement of what is available to us, namely, the Sephiroth of Yetzirah. What imm ediately follows is, therefore, a partial system of the greater teac hing of the Ladder, though it can b e used independently. (While it is not vital to an understanding of this arrangement, it is of interest to consider the following remarks of Dion Fortune in h er boo k The Mystical Qabalah, (4:12): “Concerning the Tarot cards, there a re three modern authorities of note. . . . All three a re different. Concerning the system Mr. Waite gives, he himself says `There is another system known to initiates.’ There is reason to supp ose that this is the method u sed by Mathers.”) It is this method that Dion Fortune a dopted and pu blished in h er boo k. There is, however, even b etter reason to supp ose that attributions, as published, are not that of the `other’ system, referred to by Mr. Waite. One of the most widely used Tarot packs in modern use, and which is recomm ended to all students, is that designed by Waite himself, and faithfully portrayed by Pamela Coleman Smith. We may reasonably supp ose from what he says that he was aware of this ‘other’ method, and that being so, he would be likely to incorporate it into his own pack. Without speculating further, it is interesting to o bserve that the internal evidence of Waite’s designs, i.e., the pictures actually on the ca rds, are more in acc ord with the a rrangement of the 21 stages than with any other published system. For example, cards 2, 5 and 8 (when the original numbering is restored) all show figures s eated between the Pillars of the Temple. No o ther cards s how such symbolism so clearly, and all three ca rds connect with Malkuth at the bottom of the Tree. Cards 1, 10 and 21 all contain fourfold symbolism of a more specific nature. In card 1 , the Magician stands in front of the symbols of the four Tarot suits on the table. In card 10 the four Holy Animals appear in the four corners of the ca rd. This is repeated in card 21 . These three ca rds all appear on the Middle Pillar of the Tree in ascending order (See “The Middle Pillar” below). Card 6 joins Hod and Netzac h, and shows the Sun of Tiphareth shining behind the a ngel who veils it, while ca rd 17 simil arly joins ' Hesed and Geburah, and shows the star of Kether shining through a veil of seven lesser stars)."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE MIDD LE PILL AR In this arrangement, the Middle Pillar reac hes only as far as Daath, Knowledge, representative of the Supernal Triangle a t the human, subjective level of awareness .* Let it be said here that all human awareness is ordinarily subjective, being even at its highest subject to infinitely more powerful laws of being shown “as in a mirror darkly.” *(We shall see in Part Three that whenever a “ Daath” position is reac hed, it becomes, to developing awareness, the “ Yesod” or Foundation of the level above, and there is another Tree to clim b!) With this in mind, we may nevertheless consider the relative significance of the development of awareness as portrayed by the 21 stages, and in particular the symbolism of the Middle Pillar upon which three major changes in awareness can occur. The stages concerned with this process are Stage 1, lifting awareness from sleep in Malkuth towards Yesod , shown b y the Magician; Stage 10, raising Personality awareness in Yesod to Self awareness in Tiphareth , symbolised by the Wheel, and Stage 21, elevating Self awareness to its maximum development towards Daath , Self Knowledge, or Spiritual Awareness, symbolised by the ca rd “The World.” These three ca rds are the only ones (in the Waite pack) which clearly show the symbolism of the four worlds. As we procee d, the relevant equivalent location of the important stages as described on the greater scale of the Ladder in Part Three of this work will be given, and in some measure c onnected to their relation to the 21 stages. In Stage 1 the Magician h as available the four symbols of the Tarot suits, representing Fire, Water, Air and Earth. These may be taken to represent the too ls we learn to use on our journey. In stage 10, the Tarot card The Wheel shows the four Holy Animals in the c orners of the ca rd, eac h with an opened boo k. This s ymbolises the work we have to do in order to apply our learning and further our progress. In stage 21, the same Holy Animals again occupy the four corners of the ca rd, but this time a s s imple representations without wings, boo ks or other attributes, symbolising the simplicity of true knowledge. The symbolism of these three ca rds, together with card 6 , The Lovers; card 17 , The Star; card 2 , The High Priestess; card 5 , The Hierophant , and card 8 , Justice, sugg ests that A. E. Waite may have had a very simil ar arrangement to that which is used here before him when b e designed his own cards. THE ATT RIBUTIONS A few w ords are nece ssary here, for we a re dealing with an aspect of the teac hing on a different scale from that of the 32 Paths outlined in Part Three. The main point in n eed of emphasis is that while that which is above is like that which is below, it is by no means the same thing, and that which adequately illustrates one level cannot nece ssarily be ea sily or directly transferred to another. The view from the upp er deck of the bus is not the same a s that from the lower, even though b oth share the basic principles of bus arrangement. Accordingly, the a ttributions of the Tarot trumps to the 21 Stages of the Way are different from those of the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"downward flow of the 32 Paths. There is no contradiction in this; the same too ls are being u sed in a different manner, that is all. For example, we may use a spoo n for stirring, for measuring, or for cracking the top of a boiled egg. When, in due time, we have used the too ls and completed the building of the “Temple not made with h ands,” we put the too ls aside. This work is not a game to be played, and although “magical” symbolism i s employed by the Tarot, any ideas we might get that we a re in any way some sort of “magicians” with “special powers” belong to the c omic boo ks and science fiction or fantasy movies, not real life. Real life is much more c lever than that. The foundation of the Tree of Life is the Sephira Yesod. It is represented in the 21 Stages by The High Priestess, card 2 . Below her are two figures ; the Foo l and The Magician. The Foo l, in Malkuth, has yet to awaken and k nock at the gate. “The Gate” is one of the titles of Malkuth. When we a waken, due to events and circumstances outside of ourselves, we c ome under the influence a nd operation of Step 1 , called elsewhere “right impulse” or “goo d impulse” a nd d evelop a desire to seek Knowledge. In doing so, we become a “Magician,” a rmed with the too ls symbolised by the objects on the table before us. The process of awakening has begun, and can continue until we become Self-aware in Step 4 . We begin to apply the virtue of Malkuth, discrimi nation. Here we stand at the e ntrance of the outer court of the Temple, as prepared as it is possible to be, seeking admission. Before us are three figures, all representatives of the Temple, only one of whom can grant admission. On one side is the figure of the Hierophant, seated between the Pillars of the Temple. A priest, however, cannot grant admission, for such work is to expound the teac hing in a manner acce ptable a nd intelligible to those outside the Temple gate, whether they seek admission or not. On the other side is the figure of Justice, who also cannot grant admission, for this work is to bring the unseen influences of the teac hing to those outside, and to assess the worthiness of applicants for entry. By these two, after a manner, the ca ndidate has already been prepared, and stands at the feet of the High Priestess in Yesod, who holds the scroll of the Law, and who alone ca n grant admission to the outer court of the Holy place s. THE 21 STAGES OF THE WAY “The Fool” This is not properly the first stage in the journey towards Self-awareness. Rather is it a nece ssary pre-stage whereby a ce rtain amount of preparation h as already been done. As it is an absolute nece ssity that this preparation is made, a great deal of importance is attached to it. This takes place very much in the e veryday material world, and is concerned with the body of things as it appears to unawakened awareness. It is only the body, not the soul, nor the spirit, except by reflection, and body may also be symbolised by our own planet, the Earth itself. The body is a shell, a c ontainer - in this case for the soul and Spirit which motivates it. And the world of shells or husks is called, in Kabbalah, Klippoth. It has nothing to do with any kinds of demon, except perhaps the ‘demons’ we a re"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ourselves. Here we may be c ompared with the figure on the ca rd, from the point of view of the development of awareness. We a re governed by what are basically bodily considerations, though we may not recognise them as s uch, attributing our desires to o utside influences and other people. Even at this early stage, a higher consciousness is at work in us, seeking to develop, to bring u s closer to Self-realisation. This causes us in different ways, depending up on what sort of persons we a re, to attempt to change direction and to make the fullest use of choice. At this s tage, however, we do not know enough to do this properly. In fact we do not usually know that we do not know, often supp osing that we know a great deal. We need to learn that what often appears to be decision b ased up on experience may in fact be no more than conditioned reflex, built-in reac tions to events and circumstances, having little to do with choice on our part at all. The more our awareness s trugg les to develop however, the greater the likelihoo d of our following the path of the figure on the ca rd. The dog at our heels represents the law w hich governs the direction of things, and the body of things. It is attempting to tell us to wake up and loo k where we a re going. As generally we do not realise that we a re (in relative terms) asleep, we take the unavoidable step over the c liff, and find that our previous values no longer apply; this is the Awakening - with a bump, always, and often painful. Putting this another way, before the first step p roper may be taken, we must see that we have been living our lives as if asleep, treating d reams as reality. The awareness of life that is possible, compared to what sometimes passes for it, is like the difference between sleep and waking. To begin to know ourselves, we need to see how much we have been spending our lives in a sequence of action and reac tion. To see this, all that is nece ssary is a little honest observation of our own behaviour. The first thing is to 'Wake up' if only for a moment now and then. The key to this is observation, coupled with discrimi nation - the virtue of the Malkuth. Observation of action-reac tion in the e vents of our daily lives; observation of the appearance of things. To do this, it will help if we remind ourselves as frequently as is practical, to stop. That is, whenever we remember, deliberately to interrupt the flow of action-reac tion in which we a re e ngaged, to stop and observe what is. Comm on sense should tell us when not to practice this exercise. We may be surprised at what we discover. On the scale of the Ladder, this position is directly related to Path 28. The text for this path states: “T he Active Intelligence. Thence is created the spirit of eve ry c reature of the supreme orb, and the activity, the motion to which they are subject.” By “creature” is here understoo d the a nimal body, which h as an intelligence of its own, not the soul or spirit who inhabits it (you or I, for example). A major realisation for us at this s tage is to recognise that we a re not our bodies, but something else. The quest for that something else now becomes our imm ediate concern. Intellectually, this may appear obvious, but this work is not an intellectual activity ; not an interesting mental exercise. It is learning to recognize our true psychological and spiritual identities. It is about living what we do and"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"learn. Stage One, “The Magician” When first we open our eyes after the Awakening, it is as though we have passed through a gate into a new and u nexplored region. This s tage takes us from Malkuth, the world of appearances, to Yesod, the Foundation. These c onnecting stages represent the ac tivity of consciousness, and we ca n expect to be particularly active during this first stage. So, of course, it always is when we discover something new w hich invites us to explore. The hidden potential stored in the ‘foundation’ of our natures is ready to be stimulated into action, and will have definite e ffects in the real world. One of the titles given to Malkuth is “The Gate” a title a lso given in esoteric a strology to the sign Cancer, ruled by the Moo n - also attributed to Yesod. One quality of this s ign of the z odiac is that of holding tightly to that which we possess; a self-contained principle which at times can degenerate into avarice, a vice a ssociated with Malkuth. Another aspect of this sign is what is often described as moo diness - a description of some Cancerians which may not be gratefully rece ived. More acc urately this impression is formed due to a tendency to engage in a c onsiderable degree of reflection, often quite deeply. The Moo n, we know, reflects the light of the Sun, and Cancer is a sign which may produce people who o ften unerringly capture or reflect the ac tivities and attitudes of others. This can sometimes incline to participation in some form of entertainment or theatrical activity. The important thing is that the talent for reflection can b e a form of acc urate imi tation, although it may over- or under- stress certain aspects. So it is with us. In order to understand the nature of people, particularly of ourselves, we need to gather with crab-like tenacity the qualities which may be used to reflect and d irect the qualities of the inner and d eeper levels of our being, beyond the superficial appearance; to learn to know and u nderstand both ourselves and others, and in so doing, to make improvements . The source of light at this s tage is s ymbolised by the reflective Moo n of Yesod , at the feet of the High Priestess, the rece ptacle of the e manations; the vast hidden potential of the Tree of Life itself, of which it is s aid that it has its roo ts in h eaven and its branches in Earth. At this s tage we a re particularly under, and sensitive to, the influences of psychic “moo n” forces, and the tenacity and self-containment of the c rab are nece ssary to keep our balance. This is also the very first step in the purification of awareness, and for this reason we must keep ourselves very much awake a nd alive to the power of the hidden potential whose e nergies lie before us. In the Waite pack the ‘Magician’ is s hown with five objects, four on the table, and one in the raised right hand. This latter represents freedom of choice a nd action, free will, while the other hand, pointing towards the ea rth, represents the direction in which the power is to be e mployed: in the real world of living things, symbolised by the growth of vegetation in front of the table. On the table itself are the four symbols of the Tarot: the wand, the c up, the sword and the c oin. These four symbols relate directly to the four worlds of Kabbalah,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"and to human n ature. The wand represents the world of Atziluth; in us it represents our spiritual origin. The c up represents the world of Briah, or world of creation; in us it represents our most fundamental essence, an essence of Spirit, which in its original purity is called Yechidah , recognisable by us only through Knowledge. Yechidah carries the c onnotation, in Hebrew, of “only child” or “only-begotten” a nd thus points towards a perception of the otherwise seemingly absurd Christian doctrine of Jesus as the “only-begotten” of God. The Atziluthic principle in us is called in Kabbalah, ‘ Hia , usually translated “life” but as it is used here is particularly related to the One Life of Kether, origin of all li fe a nd of the Tree of Life. The Hebrew w ord is also the roo t of the word for “Eve,” described in Genesis as “the mother of all li fe (or living).” The Briatic principle in us is called Neschamah , which may be translated loo sely as aspiration and ideals. So we may say that in order to perfect ourselves we must aim for union with the One Life of Kether, via Yechidah , or the spirit within ourselves, and which we truly are. The sword represents the world of Yetzirah, and the power of reason, properly understoo d as the intelligence which makes us human in a way different from other creatures. It is this native human intelligence which we now must learn to use a s our “sword” of truth, to separate a nd d iscrimi nate between that which is real and that which is not. Discrimi nation is the virtue of Malkuth. It is the development of this quality which h as brought about the Awakening. As we now learn to discrimi nate between previously hidden qualities within, so we develop in proportion the virtue of Yesod, which is Independence. Although the stages of the Way are eac h symbolised by the figures on the different Tarot cards, we remain fundamentally a “Foo l” in different situations. The differing images on the ca rds represent the forces and p rinciples which impress themselves upon us, and which we seek both to reflect into the world, and to reflect upon in our journey towards knowledge a nd u nderstanding. The c oin represents the world of Assiah, of the visibly material, and is represented by what is known as Nephesh , which h as been interpreted as the a nimal passions. The use of the word “passions” is a little unfortunate, for modern usage has distorted its original m eaning. It is better to think of this principle a s our animal nature, closely related to the body itself, which is the a nimal form within which we are temporarily confined. The important thing to understand is that in all the stages of the Way the work we do is reflected through this animal body and animal nature. It is with this nature a nd this body that we will give e xpression to the principles and forces that we c ome to know, and which are impressed up on us. The ac tivity of these principles and forces will reflect through us acc ording to o ur understanding, combined with the direction of the will. The e nergies invoked by the double-ended wand in the right hand will have to pass through the ‘magician’ (you or me) before they may be directed into the world by the downward-pointing left. It is therefore wise for us to note that this wand is double e nded, and that the sword of reason is double sided - discrimi nation, in other words, is absolutely essential in all 21 Stages. Stage Two, The “Hi gh Priestess” In the second stage we meet for the first time the principle of Yesod, the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"foundation. This might be c onsidered as a first exploratory meeting, for the complete foundation is that of a rounded and integrated p ersonality - a work which n ever cea ses in life, however far we progress. The stages of personality are the first ten stages along the Way. When we have returned to Yesod a second time via stage nine, and with our feet firmly on this foundation, we may, if we a re ready, take the path of the wheel in stage ten in an attempt to lift our entire level of being from personality, based on the Yesod foundation, to Self, which centres on Tiphareth . This s tep has been described by one schoo l as a c hange in our ‘centre of gravity.’ In stage two, however, we touch the principle upon which personality is based as an apparently unknown and very powerful force in our lives - which it is. In speaking of the sign Cancer in stage one, we said that it was ruled by the moo n. From the point of view expressed here, we a re saying that in Yesod lies the controlling power which is itself the roo t cause of tenacity and the reflective qualities we need. In astrology, the e lement of water is assigned to Cancer, and it may be said that the foundation of human personality is of a watery, fluid nature; reflective, as water at night may show the reflection of the moo n in the sky, and as the moo n itself reflects the light of the sun. This illustrates very clearly an aspect of the Teac hing, that the main function of personality is its capacity acc urately to reflect the light of Self from Tiphareth, to which latter Sephira Kabbalah attributes the sun. At this point it is appropriate to say something of what are ca lled the chakras in the human b ody, and of the subtle body of refined matter comm only referred to in occult literature a s the etheric body, or etheric double. It is called a double beca use, in appearance when seen apart from i ts denser, more material counterpart - the “shell” we have a lready spoken of - it is a whitish replica of the physical body with which we a re famili ar. This etheric body is referred to Yesod, and it is this body which separates from the shell of the physical in certain kinds of out of the body experiences, and at physical death. These e xperiences are comm only called astral projection, but “astral” projection and etheric projection are not the same thing. In etheric projection, consciousness is transferred to this “Foundation” body upon which the physical is molded , and is able to move a round in the usual surroundings of the e veryday world, which appears exactly as we see it in the normal waking state, except that we may notice a kind of white “mist” pervading everything, called by some the “astral light.” This is a term which h as had its meaning blurred from too much usage by too many people with n ot enough understanding or experience. In “astral” projection, the c ontents, or rather particular aspects of some c ontents of the psyche, are ca pable of being p rojected onto their own plane, which may be an inner, subjective one or an outer objective level one step removed from the etheric c onditions mentioned above. It is on this Yetziratic or astral level that the so-called angels and d emons, etc. of so-called ‘magical’ operations are encountered, and it need hardly be said that such experiences are of the inner subjective variety, and in consequence not reliable a s evidence of anything except perhaps the state of mind of the person experiencing the phenomena. Such"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"experience properly belongs to psychology - but psychology is itself an important study within the Teac hing. On one scale Yesod is s een as the lowest Sephira in the world of Yetzirah, and it is important to realise that in Yetzirah the products of fantasy have a s much apparent reality as the record of material events held in the memory. Behind this s imple fact lie the roo ts of some psychological or psychic disorders. The chakras are ce ntres of force, or energy, within the etheric body, and have a simil ar importance to this body to that which the organs of the physical body have in the material world. In b oth cases, the organs of the body are vital to existence. The first or lowest of the chakras is related to Malkuth, and the posterior pelvic plexus or nerve c omplex in the physical body [the Muladha ra chakra]. In practice, the relationship between the etheric and p hysical body is maintained by these complex n erve ce ntres throughout the physical body. Under normal circumstances the etheric ce ntre, or chakra, appears to be interwoven with the physical nerve complex or its equivalent by very fine c onnections or threads of etheric substance. In etheric projection, these c onnections are loo sened so that the etheric double may act independently of the physical, and the e nergy interplay which is nece ssary between them to maintain physical life is s aid to be maintained by what has been called in occult and spiritualist literature a s “the silver cord.” This is usually seen (when it is s een) us connecting the two bodies, either via the solar plexus centre, or the ce ntre between the e yebrows. Some researchers however do not report such a c ord, and appear to be a ble to function without one. There is an aspect of the Malkuth centre which is related to the a nterior pelvic plexus in the body, that is to say in the front, and this is referred to Yesod rather than Malkuth [the Svadd isthana chakra]. It is useful and p ractical to consider these two lower Sephiroth as two parts of a single whole. From the point of view of the development of awareness these lower centres are particularly related to the first two stages of the Way. The main function of these two plexi and their etheric c ounterparts is the maintenance of the “automatic” bodily functions s uch as walking sleeping and breathing, as well as the e xcretion of waste matter. At the same time, the a nterior pelvic plexus is very much concerned with the mechanics of sexual behaviour. It cannot be stressed too strongly that it is the mechanics, not the delights that are referred to. We may find in stage one, and more particularly stage two, that sexual awareness is heightened. This level is closely related to Nephesh , and our animal nature, and at this level sexual awareness is of this kind. The more ea sily recognisable a spects of human sexuality which we e xperience a s excitement, but of a different kind, such as attachment to particular aspects of sex, and which stir our feelings and thoughts, do not belong here. Even so, the a ttraction of the Nephesh nature is very powerful, and p robably acc ounts for more of the underlying attitudes and conditioned reflex mechanisms in the human personality than is generally realised. As ever, the e ssential approach in such matters is that of discrimi nation and observation. The next centre with which we a re c oncerned is the solar plexus centre, related to the Manipura chakra a nd stage ten of the Way; it is at this level that we, as ordinary human b eings, live our lives. This life is based on personality"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"and the four lower Sephiroth. From this point we may, when we a re ready, take the step to Self-awareness and transfer our centre of being to the heart centre, related to Tiphareth on the Tree. The Indian method of mantric meditation imported into the West by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is based on a Hindu mantra related to the solar plexus, and we ca n see how such a method is intended to work upon a particular centre in order to strengthen it. This is one way of building a firm Yesod, a firm foundation, for when we c ome to stage ten, we return to Yesod a second time, as can b e seen from the diagram ill ustrating the 21 stages. From the point of view of the Teac hing, such a method u sed on its own h as many shortcomings. It is important to us not only to be a ble to go somewhere, to be somebody, and to grow in awareness, but also to know w here we a re, where we have been and to see where we a re going, or as much of what lies ahead as may be possible. This is why we have a map, called the Tree of Life, and the information nece ssary to interpret it. We find it useful to know, for instance, that the Hindus have other mantras for other centres, and are thus able to put such methods into perspective in relation to the whole being, an advantage that someone who practices mantric meditation with n o o ther experience than the mystique of an initiation ceremony in Sanskrit does not possess. [Details of these c an b e found in the Pelican Book, Yoga, by Ernest Wood , p. 152 ]. This is not to say that such a method of meditation should not be practised - quite the reverse; but it is to say that such practices are more effective when allied to a system of thought, and to a teac hing. Sanskrit is the language of the mysteries for the people of the East. For the West, it is the Hebrew of the Old Testament and the Kabbalah, from which tradition Jesus appeared. Having said this, it is also said that all versions of the teac hing originates in one source, and that all traditions are branches of one tree. Only goo d can come out of a marriage of East and West. A glance a t both Hebrew and Sanskrit writing still shows trace s of what may have been a once c omm on, but long forgotten, language. After the heart centre [ Anaha ta chakra] of Tiphareth comes the throat centre [ Vishuddha chakra ] referred for convenience to Daath and stage 21 of the Way. The ce ntre between the e yebrows [ Ajna Chakra] is related to that aspect of Daath which lies on the other side of the Abyss, and the Saha srara chakra, above the head, presides over all li ke a c rown, and is referred to Kether. In the development towards material expression down the lightning flash from Kether, Yesod, foundation, refers on the human scale to the etheric foundation upon which the human b ody is built. In other words, the etheric structure c omes first, and the physical is molded up on it. When the physical body dies, the etheric does not, remaining for a short time the outer container for the individual within. When we first approach Yesod in stage two, we begin to touch upon this level as s eparate, and to feel something of its power and mystery, a feeling well conveyed by the image of the High Priestess. We a re, at this point, on the threshold of the Temple, and if our work is properly done, we will be a ble to pass between the two pillars and approach the holy place s within. On the scale of the Ladder, this position is directly related to Path 25, the text of"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"which states: “T he Intelligence of Temptation o r Trial. It is the first temptation whereby God tests the devout.” Stage Three , The Empress The tarot attribution of the Empress depicts the powerful forces of life in motion. The natural im pulse of this path is from Hod to Yesod, whereas we a re seeking to develop against the flow, in the opposite direction to the lightning flash, and progress from Yesod to Hod. It follows that the discrimi nation of Malkuth and the independence of Yesod are very nece ssary prerequisites to attempting this s tage. As we saw w hen describing the Sephiroth, the vital energies of life flow down into the rece ptacle of the e manations, the form-giving Yesod, and on this path the keyword might well be “vitality”. It brings to the body the vital energies of Hod. It is clear that we need clear heads in order to keep above the rushing waters of vitality shown on the tarot card. We learned u nder Hod when discussing the Sephiroth that this Sephira is concerned with classification, arrangement and comm unication. This is the work of step three, (see the Seve n S teps at the e nd o f Part Two). To this may be a dded analysis, showing yet again the importance of discrimi nation. We need to consider all that we have discovered about ourselves and our world, and all that we a re learning still, and relate eac h to the other and ourselves, using the framework of the Tree of Life a s our guide, until we have established a ce rtain stability of thought and approach, which is to become symbolised by the Emperor in stage four. We may think here of the vital energies referred to in relation to the etheric body discussed in stage two. This body has been called the vital body, and the “powerhouse`” behind our physical m anifestation. Whereas we referred to individual chakras previously, we may now begin to realise that there is a continuous interplay of energies between them, and also a giving and resolving of vital energy to and from our environment and other people, so that the “astral light” spoken of in stage two is, in fact, the medium via which these e nergies are transmitted from place to place . Some people have a n instinctive understanding of such forces, and are a ble in some measure to take a dvantage of others, and rob them of vitality. This may well be the basis of “vampire” legends, but in general is much simpler to deal with than b y running around with woo den stakes and mallets. The simplest way to deal with such a problem i s, not surprisingly, to remove ourselves from the presence of whoever it is that is affecting u s in this way. Even so, the following comm ents s hould be noted. Such activity takes place through the solar plexus centre, provided that the body is “open” to it. As the body is a complete c ircuit in itself, we may be a ble to protect ourselves against unwanted loss of energy (which some people ca n feel draining away via this centre) by closing the c ircuit to o utside influence, making it self-contained. This is done by ensuring that the feet and hands are together, touching or clasped (or arms folded). If the feeling of loss persists, or is particularly severe, it will help to contract the muscles around the solar plexus, the muscles of the a bdomen, and temporarily to hold the breath. The breath should be held where it is, that is to"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"say, do not breathe in or out, but simply halt the breathing p rocess wherever it is at the time. It is difficult for energy to drain away under these c ircumstances, though it must be said that this method is not infallible, and may not work for everyone. Such v itality loss is not nece ssarily due to the behaviour of others, and can b e due to a simple dissipation of energy on the part of the sufferer - probably the most comm on cause, though we a ll no doubt know of people who “drain” us, and whom we instinctively avoid. It will be a ppreciated that knowledge of these things is gained by observation and experience - as is knowledge of anything. (There is a difference between knowledge a nd information). To be of use, information must be a rranged, related to o ther information, and comm unicated. In stage three we learn to do this for ourselves. Stage Four, The Emperor The symbolism of the Emperor is an apt illustration of developing awareness and individualisation. Hod is an active Sephira, and we may reca ll to advantage the aspects of Hod p reviously referred to o f analysis and classification. To quote from the previous s ection on Hod, “the differentiated p arts of the manifestation of spirit originated in Kether begin to become a utonomous.” So at this s tage it may be seen that we have c ome to the place where our own integrity, honesty (the virtue of Hod) and individuality begin to find real expression and importance. Beca use of this we find in practical work that people progress fairly quickly through the first three stages into stages four and five. The real difficulties begin in stage six, for by this time we shall be moving away from our own egocentricity towards more universal principles and qu alities of Self. The figure on the ca rd is very impressive , in royal robes, carrying orb and sceptre and seated on a throne; but the symbolism m ay not appear so glorious as first impressions s ugg est when we observe the territory which is ruled over. It is a realm of rocks and mountain peaks. This is the place of the rationalising intellect. There is a fascination about intellectual capabilities which can take hold of us, and we may find that a love of classification, categorising and rationalisation, while being nece ssary to o ur appreciation and learning, can h old u s back and d elay our further development if we e ngage in it for its own sake. We need to avoid the temptation of substituting intellect for understanding, and information for knowledge, else our environment may become a s s terile a s the rocks which surround the e mperor. If we succumb to this temptation we may sink into smug complace ncy, unlikely to develop further. Usually, however, having reac hed the heights of intellect, the very satisfaction with our own progress is likely to provide a spur, for who can resist an occa sional glance, or even several glances, at the spot from which they began? Indeed, at this s tage we a re in a position to use what we have learned, and to place it at the disposal of others following behind, which we ca n b egin to do in stage five. Before we move on though, we should begin to appreciate the deeper function of intellect, namely the a bility simply to sit, like the e mperor, and watch in silent contemplation."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"One the scale of the Ladder it is represented by Path 24, “The Imaginative Intelligence.” True c ontemplation is indeed an imaginative process - and constructive - but there is no cause for complace ncy. Stage Five, The Hi erophant This card is called in some packs “The Pope,” a nd the figure on the ca rd is in a position of great respect. So we feel ourselves to be a t this s tage. We have progressed considerably since we began, and are a ware of it. In learning to use our intellect to the best advantage we find ourselves able to discourse, and to be listened to, by those who have not travelled so far. Perhaps, however, we seem a little pontifical and condescending to them. Although we may feel this to be justifiable, for even as far as we have travelled (it is not so very far) the way has not been easy - but we have no cause to be smug. Even so, we a re well equipped to be of some help at this s tage to those beginning their journey by being able to see c learly some of the conditions which apply en route . Loo ked at on the diagram of the 21 stages, we see that this s tage links the Sephiroth Hod and Malkuth , and we a re now in a position for the first time since we began to establish where we a re by reference to two o ther points, much in the same way as a navigator of a ship at sea might take bearings to get a “fix” on the ship’s position. Many people linger in this s tage for some time, valuing the stability which can b e ac hieved here. Some become identified with their new condition, and slide quietly along the direction of the a rrow towards Malkuth, applying their new knowledge solely to the material side of life, finding that greater appreciation of the laws of action and reac tion is of value in their everyday lives. They do not seek to travel further, nor should they feel that they must. Higher Self-awareness is not for everyone, and those for whom i t is may not need to pursue it imm ediately when stage five has been reac hed, though they may well take up the journey again after a longer or shorter interval. If we feel inclined to go no further, or simply to take a break, then stage five is a goo d p lace for us to pause, whatever we may do later. Nonetheless, all are a dvised to persevere a s far as s tage five of the Way, for this stage takes us back d own to earth, to Malkuth, where a ll our work takes place , whatever we do. For those who go o n, however, Step two o f the Seven Steps remains to be consolidated, and there is one more stage before this is done. For most of us it is the stage where the road begins to clim b uphill, and we need to go twice a s fast just to stay where we a re. This is s tage six. Stage Six, The Lovers This card shows very clearly our state a t this time. It is here that we begin to feel the power inherent in our own feelings; the strange quality that lies in intuition and the glamour attached to sex. It is a very different kettle of fish from the orderly regulation of the neat “Thou shalt” a nd “Thou shalt not” of the intellect. The guidelines of stages four and five seem of little value here, yet we shall find that we need to refer to them again and again."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"We may discover that we a re reluctant to undertake this part of the journey. Finding ourselves half way across this path can b ecome a larming - we ca n b egin to swing between intellect and feelings like the unregulated p endulum of a c razy clock. Here we first begin to make the decision whether to go o n or turn back, and it may seem that it is as difficult to do the one a s it is to do the other. Make a choice we will, however, for the imm ediate goal of our journey now begins to be visible in the distance a s we become diml y aware of the possibilities before us. This is illustrated by the symbolism on the ca rd. This s tage is the Path which joins the Sephiroth Hod and Netzac h, and if we loo k at this path we see that the Self of Tiphareth, the very centre of the Tree, stands imm ediately above us, like the light behind the figure in the illustration. If we become a ware of this to any appreciable degree, we shall go o n, for we become a ware that the voice which calls us onward is our own, calling from deeper levels of being. Stage Seven, The Chariot The figure on the ca rd is handsomely attired, shaded by a glowing canopy, and the horses are two sphinxes, one black and one white, perhaps s imil ar to the Chinese Yin and Yang in intent. The c hariot has no reins, and the sphinxes are very firmly sat down, unlikely to go anywhere. This does not appear to disturb the c harioteer. It is easy to see that the foo l who began the journey, now a c harioteer, having escaped the a usterity of the intellect, needs to relax for a time in the gentle glow of feelings, discovering new delights in appreciating the e nvironment in terms of intuition in contrast to the mental gymnastics which are e ncouraged by intellectual pursuits. We may tend, at this s tage, to use our “canopy” a little too much to shield u s from some of the unpleasant aspects of reality, loo king at the world to some e xtent through rose-coloured spectacles. To begin with, in stage seven, this is quite natural, and also quite nece ssary, for it takes a little time to assimil ate new experiences of feeling-based events in life. Not that we did not experience such things before, but now they become more conscious. Throughout the first three Steps, in fact, there is nothing new in our lives other than that we begin to experience more of the e vents of life c onsciously, with the difference in attitude that acc ompanies s uch activity. Indeed, it is our very awareness that is being d eveloped, to the point where the seat of consciousness is transferred, in Step four, from the personality, or little e go, to Self. After a greater or lesser degree of relaxation in stage seven, we begin to realise that we a re in the position of being “all dressed up with n owhere to go.” We soo n find that we ca n apply this awareness for the benefit of those following behind u s on the Way much as we did in stage five. This we begin to do in stage e ight. On the scale of the Ladder, stage seven is related to Path 23, “The Stable Intelligence.” Stage Eight, Justice When, in stage five, we were a ble to help those behind u s, we were a ble to do so only in an intellectual m anner, classifying and analysing information, pigeon-holing the particulars of our understanding. To do the same thing from a feeling-based"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"approach is not so straightforward, except that by lending a sympathetic a nd understanding ear, we ca n sometimes be of more service than in any other way, simply by virtue of experience a nd the watchful use of intuition. There is also a tendency at this s tage to judg e or assess other people, feeling how they fit into the pattern of life, comparing their condition with our own and profiting by the c omparison. We may also, as may be obvious, fall easily into negative c riticism, particularly if our feeling nature rece ives a few knocks. We ca n avoid this danger, if we a re wise, by putting our experience a nd u nderstanding to goo d u se, an activity which b rings its own reward. Gradually, as we c ome to terms with our feelings and come to understand the powerful effect that feeling as s uch h as in the world around u s, even though it is, for the most part, unconscious, we gather to o urselves the knowledge gained by means of our intellectual capacities, together with the limi ted experience of our instinctive roo ts, and the understanding of the c onscious awareness of feelings (and feeling itself). We ca n n ow begin to work towards Step Four, in which we hope to become truly Self-aware; but first we must consolidate our position and establish a firm foundation from which to take such a major step. This we shall begin to do in stage nine, attempting to bring together Knowledge (Step Two) Understanding, (Step Three) and Being (Step One). For any major change in awareness to o ccur, these three factors always combine to provide the nece ssary impetus, as we ca n discover for ourselves. Stage Nine, The Hermit In this stage ,we take the final steps to establish our foundation - Yesod, towards which Sephira we now return - and the first part of the preparation n ece ssary to reac h Self-awareness. The figure on the ca rd shows a wise man, with the staff of knowledge a nd the light of understanding g oing forward alone to establish true being. Now w e a re nece ssarily alone for a time, and we withdraw from i nstruction, from seeking experience in our environment, stepping out unacc ompanied, using the light we have gathered in these preparatory stages to guide us. We a re getting closer to Self, and we loo k inward more deeply than b efore in order to integrate the personality attributes of intellect, feeling and instinct, making of ourselves a unity at the lower level of being, so that we may rise to the higher level of Self. We have experienced eac h of the three lower attributes s eparately and applied this experience to o urselves and to o ur environment. Our task in stage nine is to weld this experience together in a “whole” personality and thereby complete a solid foundation on which to build further. Stage Ten, The Wheel Prior to discovering Self, or to be more acc urate, unveiling Self, this s tage is the most important of the first ten. Here is the opportunity to transcend p ersonality and to begin to realise Self. We find that this is not so easy, for the gate into Self is narrow, and we have to pass through the veil that shrouds the light of Self, shown symbolically behind the High Priestess in stage two, and by the wings of"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"the a ngel in stage six. To make the transition from personality awareness to Self awareness requires s acrifice. The word sacrifice is used in the spiritual sense of transmutation or change, and not in the sense of “giving something up .” We may need to change our attitudes to some most dearly held ideas, ideals and illusions. The personality experiences the c leansing light of Self examination, so that it may be a worthy too l for the use of Self. Habits die hard, and this truth is demonstrated here. We may find that we have to follow the path of the wheel around the instincts, intellect and feeling many times again, discovering and integrating p arts of personality that we previously overloo ked before we a re in a c ondition to enter into the heart, where Self resides. In a sense we a re back at Path 25 on the scale of the Ladder, “The Intelligence of Temptation or Trial, by which God tests the devout.” Attitude a ttracts environment. Think about this. Many remain at this s tage for a long time - sometimes for years - without much ambition to go further, being satisfied with a firm foundation and a rounded and integrated p ersonality which b rings them true independence - the virtue of Yesod. There is no “fault” in this. They have ac hieved more than some of us who are still buffeted by the winds of circumstance. To enter the next stage, and to take the next Step of the Way requires s imple devotion. The ties which b ind awareness to personality must be loo sened and let go, personality left behind (but by no means forgotten or lost) so that we may discover Self as unadorned as a new born child. It is a Step, and a devotion, that demands the firmest of foundations and a great deal of courage. If we c hoo se to go o n, we shall need to adjust our attitudes, desires and ambitions in terms of Self awareness, terms which we do not, cannot fully understand, for we see “As in a mirror, darkly,” a nd we must take Self on trust. Given the courage, we ca n do this, for the Self that we seek is no stranger; it is the Self which we a re, and the personality which we a re not. Personality is s imply the means through which Self finds expression, which it has in fact been promoting all along, except that we have not been aware as Self , being identified with v arious aspects of personality. Stage Eleven, Strength The Tarot card “Strength” is the most subtly representative of balance in the whole of the Tarot. It shows a simply dressed woman b ending over a lion and holding its jaws. There is no coercion or exertion ; no domination. The lion appears quite ca lm; the woman is in comm and. This card symbolises Self-control - i.e., control by the Soul, or Self; control, in fact, of the lower levels governed by Yesod and p ersonality. Nowhere is s een the fierce determination of the fanatic. The woman [soul] is s erene; the lion [personality] is obedient. This is precisely the relationship we shall find with personality when we discover Self. We become a ware of freedom and clarity. Someone once described this condition as being like a day in the c ountry after it had been raining. Everything is sharper and clearer. Here we ca n n o longer foo l ourselves about what we want or what we a re. We may ignore what we see, but we ca n n ever ignore the fact that"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"we have seen it. Some a pproaches end with the discovery of Self, for when Self is discovered, we have found the e xpression of Heaven within. Some, however, will want to explore the new-found condition. Those who go o n seek to take the journey three major Steps further. In order to truly know Self, we first discover Self, and then learn to be Self. We investigate and integrate the parts of Self much as we did with personality. There a re problems of Self to be resolved, and we shall need to resolve them. After this comes the realisation of Self, in the way that one “realises” a ssets by putting them to practical use. Before we c ontinue - if we so choo se - we pause here a nd consolidate what we have learned. The next journey is a quest for Spirit, both h uman and d ivine. If we a re determined to persevere, we may learn to converse with angels, to come to know and recognise the spiritual presence in the Creation. On the scale of the Ladder, this s tage is represented by Path 22, the text of which states: “T he Faithful Intelligence. Spiritual virtues are deposited and aug ment therein, until t hey pass to those who d well und er the shado w thereof.” Stage Twelve, The Hanged Man When we have taken so great a step forward as we do in b ecoming Self-aware, it is not only natural but very nece ssary that we c onsolidate our position b y reference to what has gone before, in order to have a c lear idea of our whereabouts. In this s tage we e stablish this by reference to the a nalytical and critical faculties of the intellect, below us in Hod. The figure on the Tarot card is s uspended by one leg over a pit, with a kind of glow, or halo, around the head. We ca n see that the view of the intellect regarding Self and Self-discovery that we had at stage four was, after a manner, quite upside down. We were a ble to see that Self-discovery would require sacrifice of some kind, but that we viewed sacrifice a s being a loss. We ca n n ow appreciate that we have in fact gained considerably; that the power of intellect can n ow be a pure force, like the halo o n the hanging figure; a force a nd a ca pacity that we a re a ble, possibly for the first time, to use c onsciously, without identifying Self with our thoughts and ideas. For we a re not our thoughts ; we have thoughts. We ca n also see how incomplete we were during the first ten stages. We a re a ble to use intellect, to o bserve our thoughts as s eparate, individual events that are part of our experience of life. In life there a re two kinds of events; outer events, which take place in the circumstances of our environment, affecting u s to a greater or lesser degree, acc ording to their importance to us, and inner events which take place within us - such as individual thoughts, or complete thought processes - which interact constantly with the outer events. Now w e a re a ble to o bserve these processes, both inner and outer, without being too easily identified with any type of event or circumstance. One of the lessons we hope to learn in these further stages, which are stages of Self-awareness in the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"search for Self-realisation, is how to choo se. For this we shall need a c lear and watchful intellect, which can only be so if we have cea sed to identify with it. Stage Thirteen, Death Before we ca n set out to tackle the higher levels above Tiphareth, we must establish a sound feeling base to balance the intellect. In this s tage, therefore, we loo k back toward Netzac h and stage seven. The feeling based p erson, as distinct from the intellect based p erson, senses the significance of the c hange which takes place when Self is discovered, and while we a re a t the lower level, such considerations can arouse the unconscious aspects of life a t which most of us prefer not to loo k. We fear them as unknown, and associate them with a kind of death. To reac h Self from feelings involves wandering among these unconscious elements, seeming to pose a real threat to consciousness itself, a walking through the valley of the shadows. We now see that we have, after a manner, experienced d eath of a kind. The person we were before is gone forever, and although trace s may remain, we ca n n ever return to that person and identify with personality as we did before. We a re not feelings: we have feelings. By making conscious use of feelings and thoughts through awareness of Self we ca n use the personality in the service of later stages. The death symbolism i s two-fold here in the same way as the previous card, were we to slide down this path and re-identify with feelings, it would be a kind of death to o ur newly-awakened awareness. Some Christian symbolism i s described as s eeking “salvation” ( Tiphareth in Kabbalah) from the direction of feelings in stage seven. Likewise, the c oncepts of “rebirth, wrestling with sin, death and the devil” often take this approach. But personality in stage seven, or for that matter any of the lower stages, is incapable of doing these things. It can only affirm the intent and d evotion to the ideal. The battle a gainst evil can only take place from the level of Self, where the individual is with and in “Christ,” a nd “Christ” is in the individual. “Christ” c omes from the Greek word, `to anoint’ (as does “Messiah” in Hebrew) so that to be “in Christ” is to be in a state of spiritual anointing. “Christ in us” is s imply one way of saying that we have rece ived a spiritual anointing from a higher Source. Netzac h is one step higher up the Tree of Life than Hod, and is the nearest we come to Self from the lower stages. Also Netzac h rece ives an influence direct from the ce ntral Tiphareth, coming d own the lightning flash. Truth h as not passed through so many filters, and the feeling based p erson seizes upon feelings as a means to Self-discovery more readily than the intellectual, who has to analyse a nd classify truths before ac knowledging them . The drawback for the feeling p erson is, of course, that the intuitional perception of truth does not exempt anyone from development of the intellectual aspects of personality in order to balance a nd understand experience. The Self-aware person, loo king from Self at the feeling nature, is able to realise that, close a s feelings are to true Self they are still only a possession, and an equal part of personality together with the other parts. The card “Death” now symbolises the possibility of ascendancy over fears of death, for when we have found Self we a re open to contact with the Spirit."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The c larity that Self-awareness brings can, as we progress, make the unknown known. We ca n discover that we a re both imm ortal and eternal. The body dies; but we a re not bodies. We ha ve bodies, that is all. They are the means whereby we are a ble to localise a wareness in this world in order to gain experience. We may now start out towards the first of the deeper levels beyond Self, in which Self has its being. Stage Fourteen, The Angel, or “Temperance” We now prepare to set out, gloriously Self-aware, towards the level of desires. “Desires” here speaks of the most deeply roo ted needs of our being, having nothing to do with what we like or dislike, which is an aspect of the feeling-nature of personality in stage seven. The ca rd p ortrays an angel pouring water from one cup into another. It is a ca rd of beauty, and the a ngel has great sweeping wings. It is maintained that death does not change our fundamental being, and we shall discover that becoming Self-aware does not change it. It does change much of what we possess (although n ot all of that, as we may be ruefully aware). The change that has taken place on reac hing Self-awareness is that we now live from Self, being able to use our personality instead of living from i t, subservient to its impulses. Our basic nature is not changed, and becoming Self-aware only shows us more clearly what we a re fundamentally, for goo d or evil. By far the largest problem, and p robably the only real problem which confronts us in living from Self is pride, the vice of Self, and the only “original” sin. It is natural for us to be proud of our achievement, and to see that we a re e ternal beings with a heritage of truth. The image is true, so far as it goes, but we must put our heritage to goo d u se, however eternal the soul, and we a re not angels - yet. The figure on the ca rd p ours water from one vessel into another - a somewhat futile procedure. We ca nnot hold on to what we have, and simply enjoy our new capacities to o ur own advantage, for we have to learn that this is not the function of the human b eing in the world, even though we see so many doing this. The Tree of Life does not end with Tiphareth, but with Malkuth. The work we have undertaken leads eventually (for those who can go this far) to an understanding of how w e may bring the spiritual element into the a ffairs of Earth. For this reason ,a path is s hown on the ca rd leading either to o r from the light (in the Waite pack). The c hoice is our own. Its s ucce ssful conclusion is the taking of Step Five. Stage Fifteen, The Devil The level at which desires operate ca n b e quite terrifying. Beyond the level of Self-discovery we begin to come into close c ontact with deeper forces which motivate not only ourselves, but whole a rmies of selves, and entire departments of nature. Pride may tempt us to identify at a Self level (unfortunately this is quite possible) and claim these e nergies for our own. We a re a pt to say, “My desires,” but this level belongs at the same time to all of us and to none of us. The levels of instinct, intellect and feelings also belong to all, but these a re levels of personality, functions of being, and are in fact reflections, in the personality, of Self. Above us"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"are deeper levels of Self, and levels beyond Self. The possessive pronoun “my” properly belongs to personality and has no real place a mong the qualities of Self, nor may it properly be a pplied to Self. So long as we ca nnot discrimi nate a t the level of desires, so we a re c hained to desire, as are the unfortunate c ouple on the card, who are c hained to a stone upon which sits the devil. So long as the fires generated by desire ca n engulf us, we have ca use to be a fraid. The devil has no o bjective e xistence, as popular myth would supp ose, but represents the peculiarly human tendency to humanity’s worst vices, hence c ruelty is assigned here. In the Semitic languages from which the c oncept derives, “evil” is understoo d as the e vil disposition in h uman b eings. If therefore we pray, “deliver us from evil,” then the Aramaic-speaking p eople who gave us this prayer would have understoo d it in the sense of \"separate us from [our own] evil inclination.\" According to psychology, one of the most comm on methods of dealing with fear is to explain it away, and here we may be tempted to do this. Intellectualising, however, does not work above Tiphareth, for we have to know what we a re ; what we may safely do with such power as we find at this level of being. Yet the Sephira Geburah, which is related to this s tage (and Step five) is representative, at the higher level, of the Sephira Hod, imm ediately below it on the Tree of Life, which is its reflection, and called the sphere of intellect in stage four. Stage fifteen, however, requires a much h igher degree of this principle, which h as been spoken of as watchfulness. It also represents the faculty of reason - not the same thing as intellectualism. To understand this level and function acc ording we need to be a ble to hold our awareness - our Self awareness - still, unmoving, letting the forces flow around u s, so that we may know them for what they are without being swept along by them i nto situations which we ca nnot control. Mostly by this time we a re a ble to control our reac tions to o uter events quite well, and it is the inner situation which requires our attention. Attention - we need to attend, to be watchful. Attention - we need to attend, to be present. At this s tage may find that life will present us with considerable temptation to demonstrate how holy we have become. Also, we shall see that life will present us with truly “diabolical” situations ; situations where we must choo se, yet at the same time where we seem to have no choice a t all. Only those who have seen something of this level can fully appreciate this, for the c onflict that rages here rages within the soul and has little to do with outer circumstances. These merely throw us back on ourselves - possibly very hard, but no harder than we should be able to deal with. At this s tage, we begin to loo k for the deeper level of being which transcends Self, and we begin to appreciate that we a re terrifyingly and wonderfully not Self, but Spirit. On the scale of the Ladder this s tage is represented by Path 21: “T he Rewarding Intelligence. It rece ives the divine influence, and influences by its benediction a ll existing things. ” Now there’s s omething to think about . . . Stage Sixteen, The Tower This card, like some others, has a double significance. The images on the ca rd"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"show clearly the e ffect that occurs if we presume to claim deeper forces for our own, instead of seeing their influence working in us and through us, instead of coming to terms with them and working in line with them. If we persist in h olding on to cherished notions which h ave little relation to reality and truth - both inner and outer truth - we shall find that life will knock u s hard, and even h arder, until any false positions we a ttempt to maintain (from pride) are seen to be false. The truth, however unpalatable, has to be acce pted. It is only the top of the tower which falls, and it is only our pride which will be hurled d own b y the lightning flash. The rest of the tower is intact. This is one way of saying that however hard we may seem to be hit, it is only our identifications which h ave to go. The work we have done up to this s tage ca nnot be undone a nd we remain Self aware beings, if somewhat wiser. It can h appen, however, that unable to relinquish our identifications, we find ourselves going d own the path that joins Geburah and Hod, landing back at stage four, except that we bring with us the power of Self. We c ould in this s tate become quite formidable intellectuals, but the e nergy which gives this power is misplace d, and although we may have e xcellent Self control, we a re in an unbalanced condition, as there is no equivalent power for our feeling nature in Netzac h to use. If, in such a state, we a re to continue, we shall need to circumnavigate the whole of the lower triangle of personality once more, distributing the power of Self among the a ttributes of personality, so that we may clim b up again from a firmer foundation. If, however, we a re a ble to avoid such identifications, we ca n set out towards ‘ Hesed, via stage seventeen. Stage Seventeen, The Star This card shows a naked woman, representing the soul, with a brilliant star shining in the background. Like the a ngel of card fourteen, she has two vessels of water, but unlike the a ngel, she is pouring one on the ea rth and the other into a poo l. Gone a re the glorious trappings of card fourteen. Here we must be a s we a re, not as we would like to appear. This s tage shows the beginning of Self-realisation. Devoid of trappings and identification and attachment with lower levels, relatively humble, we a re a ble to use in a c onstructive manner the truth we have been given. Some of the water is poured up on the ground. That is to say that we may use what has been given to us outwardly, in the world. The rest of the water goes into a poo l. That is to say that we a lso apply truth inwardly towards higher and d eeper levels, allowing it to work within us in the same way as the water poured up on the earth may work outside of us. The star of Kether shines in the background, and intimations of Spirit are strong, in the same way that the star of Tiphareth shines behind the lovers in stage six, where intimations of Self are strong. We still have much to learn at this s tage, except that we begin to learn b y doing, with less emphasis on watching, which should now be second nature to us. Here we begin to be open to spiritual energies, and to transmit them to those behind u s on the Way. Stage Eighteen, “The Moon”"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Both this card and the card which follows it are ce rtainly misnamed in this arrangement. The significance of card eighteen h as to do with the ca rd as a whole, and if we c ompare the symbolism with what we know of the Sephira ' Hesed with which it is associated, we shall see that it presents highly relevant symbolism. This is the level of origins. A primeval creature c rawls out of the waters. Two ancient stone pillars s tand silent in the landscape, flanking a pathway, well trodden b ut primi tive, leading to a far off place . Two hound-like c reatures are howling at the moo n, apart from which all is s till as night. Here a re the roo ts of the e lements and the roo ts of physical form. Here, we meet the passive but powerful mi nd aspect of nature. Here, we a re in contact with the power of mighty Mother Nature herself, and subject to her dominion. Here, we c ome to terms with n atural law and find our place within it. This level, like the one before, will not allow us to identify with it nor to claim i t as “mine.” If we a ttempt to do so, then we shall be subtly but firmly removed to a lower place to learn differently. Natural law surpasses human laws and conventions. Human laws are only workable so long as they are in acc ord with it. Human law may legitimately restrict the movement of nature in ways which are in keeping with the needs of a time or place , but it cannot countermand natural law. We ca n place buckets in the rain to restrict the flow of water upon a particular spot, but we cannot stop the flow and, if the rain is heavy enough, no amount of bucket-placing will prevent the ground from becoming soaked. Here we learn to bend with the wind, like a blade of grass, to go, consciously, where it is nece ssary for us to go, and to do, consciously, what it is nece ssary for us to do. On the scale of the Ladder, this s tage is represented by Path 20: “T he Intelligence of Will. It prepares all created b eings, each individua lly, for the demonstration o f the ex istence of the primordial glory.” Wow! Stage Nineteen, “The Sun ” As with the previous card, there is more here than just the sun which forms a part of it. Here we see what may happen should the feeling which this level arouses cause us to identify with the forces of nature. We a re in danger of slithering into a warm “summ er” glow, returning, blissfully unaware of what is happening, to stage seven. Lulled, perhaps, by a false sense of security (due to pride) in the presumption that we have c onquered nature. The fall, though gentle, and not at all disruptive in the way that card sixteen depicts, is every bit as devastating. We will bring to the level of feelings in Netzac h all the power of Self, finding that we ca n appear to sweep away obstacles almost by wishing them gone. But this is the other side of the c oin shown in card sixteen, and in the same way we shall have to go round the lower triangle once more to re-establish our equilibrium. In the tarot card this is s hown b y the soul, in the form of a c hild, being carried by the horse, representing the forces of nature. The rider has no reins to guide the horse, and g oes where the horse takes it. The light of Self is left behind on the other side of the wall, although it still shines over it as does the sun on the ca rd. The lesson h ere is to be a ble to move with n atural forces without being carried"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"away by them. Stage Twenty, Judgement This card p ortrays the a ngel of judg ement calling forth the dead from their graves, symbolising the last stage before we c omplete the realisation of Self. The judg ement which is made is the judg ement which we make upon ourselves. All loo se e nds are tied up here. Any remaining p roblems are dealt with. All buried impulses, identifications and attachments are brought to light. Our house is put in order. In this s tage we ca n walk through the valley of the shadow w ithout fear, dealing with eac h ghost as we meet it, integrating what we find in the deeper levels within us, and whatever we rece ive from higher levels above us, and emerge at the other end of the valley whole a nd complete, entering into the state of grace which is called here Self-realisation. This s tage is equivalent to stage nine of personality development shown b y the Hermit, but at the higher level of Self. Here we c omplete our Self foundation in order to take the step towards Spirit, as in stage nine we prepared the ground to take the step towards Self. Stage Twenty-one, The World Our journey is almost complete. We have built our foundations and are a ble to stand in direct contact with the power of Spirit, ready to become spiritual beings when we a re ca lled from the other side of the Abyss. At this s tage the meek truly inherit the ea rth, and we ca n b ecome a direct channel for the power of the Spirit. STE P ONE Centred on Yesod The first three steps are steps of personality, as are Stages one to ten. The remaining steps are steps of Self and Self-awareness. The first stages in Step One are taken once the Awakening has begun. These a re represented by cards 0 to 3. In the beginning stages up to Stage Ten we a re a ttempting to build p ersonality into a stable foundation upon which the greater awakening to Self and Self- awareness may be begun. The first Step is the beginning of a Foundation upon which we build our understanding on the journey towards Self-awareness, Knowledge a nd true Being. As a result of a ce rtain amount of preparation in life, the desire is s timulated towards Spirit. This first step opens the Way towards freedom, independence a nd self-expression. Yesod is the ninth Sephira on the Tree of Life. Its virtue is I nd epend ence; its vice, idleness. In astrology, Yesod is represented by the Moo n. At Step One our level of being is governed by and related to the a nterior pelvic plexus, governing the organs of generation, whilst the posterior pelvic plexus, governing the organs of evacuation, may be referred to Malkuth. In the chakras of the subtle body, these a re represented by the svadd isthana and muladha ra chakras respectively. At this level, our minds tend to be dominated by sex and materialistic c onsiderations. In"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"the quest for realisation this s tep is the a rising of the right desire, or right impulse, the starting p oint which leads on to Step Two by means of goo d intention. STE P TWO Centred on Hod The second step of the Way is where we c ome to a decision, through reasoning, concerning the desire for real freedom. Here we a pply the intellect to the matter of growing towards s pirit, and we a dopt or discover a system to follow. Hod is the eighth Sephira on the Tree of Life. Its virtue is Truthfulness. Its vices are Falsehood and Dishonesty. In astrology it is represented by the planet Mercury. Here we have no doubt about the Way, for it is in line with our intentions and conviction. We have realised that we ca n go further. In the second three stages during step two, we a re strongly affected by the “vital” or “vitality” e nergies of Nature, sometimes considered to be a nalogous to the prana of Eastern schoo ls. In the subtle body it is represented by the solar plexus, a little higher than the navel, and is called the manipura chakra. In comm on with the psychologist Jung, it is important to mention that purely Eastern systems of development are unlikely to be suited to the temperament of people in the West. Jolande Jacobi, in The Way of Individua tion ( Hodder & Stoughton, 1967 ) tells the story of a Western man who spent six years in an Eastern monastery, but had to leave a s he c ould not find what he needed. On h is departure he was given an exquisitely wrapped g ift. When opened, it proved to be a beautifully bound Bible. The level of being in Step Two is basically that of Step One, except that we a re now better able to appreciate the nature of the human personality. STE P THREE Centred on Netzach The third Step of the Way. During this s tage, continual help is being rece ived from outside influences. Here begins to be formed within us a ce ntre from which we may build p ermanently in order that Self may become manifest in us. The glamour of, and attachment to possessions is very strong. We need to cultivate humanity and humili ty. Netzac h is the seventh Sephira on the Tree of Life."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Its virtue is Unselfishn ess; its vices are Selfishn ess and Lust . At this point, we must make a definite e ffort to realise the nature of love, represented in astrology by the planet Venus. The level of being at Step three is basically what it has been since we began, except that we now begin to develop a conscious desire to raise our level of being to a more permanent state, developing the heart centre, or anaha ta chakra a s we procee d. STE P F OUR Centred on Tiphareth, Foun ded on Yesod The a wakening of Self. The Fourth Step of the Way. Before this can b ecome permanent, there is a time of preparation and testing. The voice of Self is heard, the impulses of Self become known, and we a re gradually given the opportunity to see ourselves as we a re. The rest of the journey will need all of our qualities. If we continue further, we ca n b e united after Step Four in a manner not easily described. Having p ermanent centres, these ce ntres are linked in Eternity, and we are truly “members, one of another.” Tiphareth is the sixth path on the Tree of Life. Its virtue is Devotion; its vice is Pride . In stage ten, we have our being in the region of the solar plexus in the body, there being continual interplay between this centre a nd the lower plexi. At the same time, we begin consciously to rece ive impressions from the heart centre which flow downwards and evoke a response. In Step Four our centre of being is transferred to the heart centre. We get the first real glim pses of spiritual awareness and the warmth of spiritual love. This has been described as a c hange in our centre of gravity. After such a c hange, we ca n never be the same a gain. STE P F IVE Centred on Geburah The fifth step of the Way. Here we begin to see the ac tivity of Spirit in every manifest thing and see that they are, beca use of Spirit ,not many things, but one thing. Not many lives, but one life; a life that is comm on to all creation. Here we see this; we have yet to know it. Here lies the strength of Spirit, and the weakness of humanity, shown b y the c ruelty of pride. This pride is generated by attachment to the things of Self, by identification with that centre in us which is nece ssary for us to be a ble to continue, formed at the fourth Step of the Way."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Its virtue is courage. Its vice is cruelty. At this s tage we still have our being in the heart centre, and d evelop insight. We begin to see ourselves and things as they really are. We realise a bout things what they are, how they are c onstituted, and observe their properties. Also we begin consciously to become a ware of the a ttraction of Spirit, which informs all that is. Geburah is the fifth Sephira on the Tree of Life. STE P SIX This Step completes the balanced triad of Tiphareth, Geburah and ' Hesed (in ascending order). Our centre of being becomes more firmly roo ted in the heart centre, and a serious awareness of spiritual love begins to manifest itself towards us. It is very well described by the text of Path Eighteen. ` Hesed is the fourth Sephira on the Tree of Life. Its virtue is obedience (to spiritual law); its vices are hypocrisy, bigotry, gluttony (thinking we know better ...). STE P SEVEN The seventh Step of the Way. Here we may begin to manifest Spirit directly, for we a re one with Spirit, and we a re Spirit. This is the fourth state of awareness beyond which lies, on the other side of the Abyss, the worlds of Spirit. Those who have progressed this far may, in this life, take the position of Knowledge ( Daath) from time to time, and in Knowledge of Creation may give this knowledge, given first to them by the Spirit, to o thers on the Way following. On the scale of the Ladder stage 21 and Step Seven are represented by Path 19: “T he Intelligence of the Secret of all t he Spiritual Activities. The fullness which it rece ives derives from the highest benediction and the Sup reme Glory.” Two centres in the subtle body are a ffected by this Step. One is the throat centre, governing the organs of speec h, and the other is the ce ntre in the region at the back of the head, sometimes associated with that part of the body where the nerves from the left and right hemispheres cross over as they move downwards through the body. Via this centre we may, under certain circumstances, rece ive instruction from \"higher\" or \"inner\" planes and intelligences s uch as are described in (for example) modern theosophical writings as \"Masters.\" In the Hebrew mystery tradition they are known as Magg idim. Other systems have other names for them, but all systems refer to them i n some way or another. In b iblical literature they are the “angels” - or spiritual m essengers.

The important thing to realise is that the a ttributions are not a modern invention, but follow logically and consistently from the a rrangement described. As will quickly be seen, the texts of the 32 Paths are c oncerned with matters spiritual, and it is to the spiritual life that the work of the true Kabbalist is, and always has been directed. This is not to say that the material life is of no consequence. The way in which we conduct our affairs in this world and this everyday life is as much a part of the spiritual work as the deepest meditation or the highest contemplation, whether that work is based up on traditions of Judaism from which Kabbalah derives, or upon later Christian traditions which gratefully rece ived it. In discussing the origin of the Christian Eucharist, one scholar remarked that not too much could be made of the sacredness of a particular Jewish meal, such as the Passover, as every meal is sacred in Judaism. In the same spirit, we need to remember that all of the Sephiroth and all of the 32 Paths are Holy. All are Paths of Wisdom. The word for Wisdom, both in Hebrew and in Greek, is feminine, and appears as a “saint” in the Christian tradition as Saint Sophia. This is how w e may wish to understand the true mystery behind the e xpression, “Mother of God.” “JAC OB’S LADD ER” The main tributary of the stream of Kabbalist Teac hing in the western world of the twentieth century has for many y ears been fed by the work of the Hermetic order of the Golden Dawn, its s ucce ssors and its imi tators. Today's s tudents are indebted to this work, but the river has broken its banks, and we find that although many people know a great deal about Kabbalah, not so many know w hat Kabbalah is about. The inspired Freemasons of the Golden Dawn, while passing on to us the important and vital elements of the Teac hing, also passed on their own inspired guesswork, which coupled with an apparent love of secrecy for its own sake, left a number of \"deliberate blinds\" and attributions which do not fit the facts, distort the tradition, and d o not make sense. Even so, they have performed a valuable service in that they have made us loo k for the facts, the tradition, and the sense, which otherwise we might not have done. Face d with the teac hings of a profound study to which h as been added confusion, uncertainty, and misinformation, the best means of establishing the truth is by reference to an earlier source than the polluted tributary. One of the ea rliest Kabbalist works is the Hebrew Sepher Yetzirah , rendered by Friedman as \"Boo k of Creation.\" Some study of Hebrew as a language"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"soo n shows that Friedman, like the \"adepts\" of the Golden Dawn, has taken a small but serious liberty of his own. \"Boo k of Creation\" would need to be a translation of \" Sepher Briah.\" Although we could say that we a re talking about creation, which is exactly what Kabbalah is about, it is not about magic, self-seeking (in the ordinary sense) or personal aggrandisement. The word Yetzirah is best rendered as \"Formation\" - in other words, not what is created, but how, and the work is usually known as the \"Boo k of Formation,\" which is a c orrect translation from the Hebrew. Face d then with confusion and contradiction, what does Kabbalah say of itself? According to Sepher Yetzirah , creation as we know it is emanated via thirty-two paths of wisdom, involving ten Sephiroth, or numerations, regarded as principles of development, to which are a dded the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet ( Kabbalah h aving its origins in Israelite religion). It is clear that the Golden Dawn understandably, but incorrectly, supp osed that 10 p lus 22 being 32 , the first ten of the 32 p aths related to the Sephiroth, and the remainder to the Hebrew letters, a supp osition which is not reinforced by the text of Sepher Yetzirah. Some pre- Golden Dawn representations of Kabbalah's \"Tree of Life\" show an arrangement of twenty-two paths or connections between the Sephiroth on the Tree, which while satisfying the required qu antity, do not satisfy the enquiring mind, nor appear to have a ny real raison d'etre other than perhaps to prevent the Sephiroth from dangling in space , a problem easily solved by joining them i n their given order of development, and thus producing the well known appearance of a \"lightning flash\" and d escribed as s uch in the Sepher Yetzirah . Having also available the text of another Kabbalist classic which gives a separate description of the thirty-two paths, the Golden Dawn assigned the first ten to the Sephiroth, and the remainder to twenty-two paths nowhere described as s uch in the Sepher Yetzirah . In order to be c onsistent, an examination of the internal logic of the diagram which shows these paths makes it plain that there would need to be not 22 but 24, for there a re no paths s hown b etween the 2nd and 5 th Sephiroth or the 3rd and 4 th. The a bsence of the latter means that there is no route in such an arrangement for a \"lightning flash\" to follow, which is absurd. Be that as it may, and allowing for some mystery to explain the omission, the Golden Dawn then allocated to these paths the twenty-two Hebrew letters. While this arrangement shows a kind of logic, it is not the logic of the Teac hing. As an example, the first of the 22 letters was assigned to the path b etween the 1st and 2 nd Sephiroth, and the second letter to that between the 1st and 3 rd. As the teac hing of Kabbalah requires that the development of the Sephiroth follow the natural order 1,2,3, we a re bound to ask how the path from 1 to 3 comes into being before that between 2 and 3 ? And why is there no \"path\" between 3 and 4 ? It might be a rgued that there a re other natural progressions than that of a simple series, and the Sepher Yetzirah employs a different order for the letters of the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Hebrew alphabet than a purely alphabetical one. However, the Golden Dawn did not use the order given in the Sepher Yetzirah , but assigned the letters in simple alphabetical order to an illogical arrangement of paths inconsistent with the text. In order to resolve the problems thus created, we have referred to the source material of the Sepher Yetzirah and the text of the Thirty-Two Paths of Wisdom. We have followed the sense of the Sepher Yetzirah and arranged the 32 p aths in the order of a lightning flash. As the a rrangement of the known universe a ppears to be built upon a foundation b est described by the mathematical factor, pi, the resulting d iagram i s built upon a succe ssion of overlapping consecutive c ircles. In h aving d one this we find d epicted ten overlapping spheres or Sephiroth, a point emphasised in Sepher Yetzirah , which states most positively that there a re \"ten and not nine, ten and not eleven.\" We a lso find that the text of the Thirty-Two Paths of Wisdom becomes less cryptic. The text of path 10 for example states that it \"has its s eat in Binah.\" Reference to the Ladder of the 32 p aths s hows that it does just that. We a lso find illustrated the doctrine of the three \"veils of negative e xistence\" and the four Kabbalist worlds. Procee ding from this base to the text of Sepher Yetzirah itself, a c onsistent arrangement is developed which admittedly needs further research, and it is to be hoped that the distribution of this work will stimulate students to undertake the task. It was first thought that Sepher Yetzirah should be regarded as a comm entary on all 32 Paths of Wisdom. While this was a natural assumption, it also proved to be superficial. On examination of the various attributes described in the Sepher Yetzirah it fell out quite naturally that these a ttributes came to a full stop at path 28. This created a momentary puzzle until (referring to source) it was realised that the title of the work itself provided the solution. Path 28 is the final point of the development of only the first three worlds of Kabbalah, and thus the final point of the world of Yetzirah from which the boo k takes its title. In assigning the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, the order of the Sepher Yetzirah has been followed, which classifies them not alphabetically, but in the order of three mother letters, followed by seven double letters and twelve simple letters. The a rrangement of seven double letters also follows the traditional arrangements of the seven planets of the a ncients. Furthermore, when these planets are place d on the diagram of the Ladder they are seen to conform, in their double rulership of astrological signs, to the traditional and natural arrangement of the a strological \"wheel.\" The a ssignment of the signs of the z odiac to the twelve simple letters demonstrates a simil ar consistency. In chapter three of Sepher Yetzirah , the three mother letters are mentioned again in more detail, with a repetition of the c oncept of six permutations as conceived in"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"relation to the divine name (YH WH). Individually however, they are referred to spirit, water and fire respectively, also referred to much earlier, in chapter one, to paths 1, 2, 3 and 4 . This results in the c urious allocation of the letter Aleph to both of the first two paths, the letter Mem to the third, and the letter Shin to the fourth. That there is a puzzle here is s elf-evident, and Sepher Yetzirah seems at pains to point this out when it mentions the three simple letters \"holding the secret\" of the three mothers. In the meantime, we have a wealth of material to consider and d evelop, the skeleton of which n ow follows. It is to be hoped that new and later generations of students will put flesh on these bones, and in emulation of Genesis breathe the breath of life into the body of the teac hing. (The a bove was written in 1977 . Since then it has become a pparent that the three mother letters, Aleph, Mem, Shin, should be a ssigned to paths 7, 8, and 9 respectively). THE E MANA TION OF THE FOUR WORLDS It will be seen from the diagram Ladder that this process of emanation is begun in the Major Sephiroth at Path Four (in the ca se of Kether). With the development or establishment of a centre to any Sephira, the seed is s own at the same time for its s ucce ssor. Not so imm ediately obvious is that this applies also to the four worlds. In Path Ten for example the centre of Binah is reac hed, and the seed of ' Hesed is s own. Creation as we know it begins. Also, the centre of the highest world of Atziluth h as been established in the downward flow of creation, and the world of creation called Briah is begun. Study soo n shows that the principle of emanation is illustrated by the diagram of the Ladder, from Kether to Malkuth , and from Atziluth to Assiah. FOUNDA TION CARD S OF THE T AR OT In the downward attributions of the Tarot trumps certain cards fall in eac h of the greater Sephiroth, and in the minor Yesod position. In ascending order of the Ladder they are a s follows: Malkuth - \"The World\" - card 21 , Path 32. Yesod - \"Judg ement\" - card 20 , Path 31. Hod - \"The Star\" - card 17 , Path 28. Netzac h - \"Temperance\" - card 14 , Path 25. Tiphareth - \"Strength\" - card 11 , path 22. Geburah - \"Justice\" - card 8 , Path 19. ' Hesed - \"The Hierophant\" - card 5 , Path 16. Binah - \"The High Priestess\" - card 2 , Path 13."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Note that card 11 \"Strength\" falls in Tiphareth in b oth the minor and the major scale. It can easily be seen that eac h Sephira is s hown to be the source of that which succee ds it, namely: Hod is the source of Yesod , as the foundation of Hod is Path 28 \"The Star\" which b ecomes the ce ntral Path of the Sephira Yesod , and may be regarded as the ruling p rinciple of Yesod . Here a gain, the Ladder is s een to illustrate the doctrine of the e manations, and the teac hing itself. The 21 Stages in relation to the Tarot and the Ladd er. The practical link between the Major and the Minor Sephiroth. In the Seven Steps of the 21 stages these c omm ence a gain in eac h world when the Daath position is reac hed, which would be a nalogous to a Step Eight except that Knowledge, being a function of awareness, is in reality the ultimate development of Tiphareth. So in theory there a re 80 Steps to Path 10. In practice such an ascent is not possible. The practical limi t for our progress in this life is the highest point of the greater Tiphareth: Path Sixteen, Kether in Yetzirah. The a bsolute limi t is the Daath function of this in Path Thirteen, at the centre of the greater ' Hesed, touching at the same time the highest point of the greater Geburah, and the lowest point of the greater Binah, which shows the \"link\" across the Abyss of the Four-in-One Tree. In terms of the minor sephiroth this point is both Yesod in Atziluth and Daath in Briah. The practical limi t of Path Sixteen is represented in the minor sephiroth by Malkuth in Atziluth , Tiphareth in Briah , and Kether in Yetzirah. Those who understand will appreciate that no incarnate human intelligence ca n pass beyond Kether in Yetzirah without becoming d iscarnate. Hence, the Daath function shown in terms of Path Thirteen can only be a temporary state giving contact with the highest worlds of Spirit, in order to bring that Spirit back d own through the worlds. This will give 21 Steps in all, plus the Daath function, which gives the basis for a study of the a pplication of the Tarot and the Hebrew alphabet. The Emanations .

The Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom constitute the framework from which this text has been derived. They are themselves the Keys to Kabbalah from which we have taken the title of the whole work.

It will be seen as the scheme unfolds that in the process of the development of the 32 p aths acc ording to the order of the \"lightning flash\" that ten and not nine, ten and not eleven Greater or Major Sephiroth are revealed.

These 29 attributions will be found to correspond with the version of the Ladder given in the works of Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi (Warren Kenton).

The Greater Tarot . Comm encing at Path Eleven will be found a different arrangement of the Tarot cards from that given in the section on the 21 Stages. This demonstrates the subtlety of the Tarot, which first appeared at a time of persecution of the followers of esoteric teac hings. Indeed, the internal evidence of the ca rds s ugg ests that the important basics of the teac hings were e ncapsulated in them i n order to preserve it.

In the nearly two thousand years of the present era, this is an institution which h as undergone many changes, trials and tribulations. It has been arguing with itself since a t least the second century, and in our own day continues to do so while a t the same time searching d esperately for a means to unite. However, the c onflict is not between churches s o much as between institutions, and the real problems are political, not spiritual. The word church is taken from the Greek ecc lesia which means comm unity, and the \"Church,\" in the fullest sense of the term, properly refers to the c omm unity of believers. This church transcends s ectarian differences. Many orthodox institutions would recognise this transcendence in principle, but in practice it tends to undermine a particular institution's claim to be the c ustodian of the full truth. Yet the very structure upon which apostolic a nd catholic c hurches are built indicates to the Kabbalist that it must at one time have been b uilt upon a famili ar and simil ar foundation. In the a ncient catholic c hurches, in which must be included the Orthodox churches of the ea st, there were seven degrees of Holy Order. These a re found to correspond d irectly with seven of the Greater Sephiroth of the Ladder. In other words, the very structure of the Episcopal and Apostolic system i s a direct reflection of the Teac hing. Would it be too much to wonder if the ea rly church was not perhaps a Schoo l of Kabbalah? Was is not, after all, founded by Israelite Christians? Before his conversion, the a postle Paul sat at the feet of the Kabbalist Rabbi Gamaliel. There a re some who maintain that Jesus himself was trained in the Kabbalist schoo ls of the Essenes. He ce rtainly taught many of their doctrines. We ca nnot assent to this claim with much certainty, but there is enough to make us wonder. [See my later work, \"The Naza renes - A Study in Christian Origins\"]. In ascending order of the Ladder the degrees of Christian Holy Order are a s follows: Clerk or Cleric (a student degree); Doo rkeeper ; Reader; Exorcist; Acolyte; Subdeac on and Deac on. There were no bishops in the modern sense of the term, and no priests in the ea rly Church. The first ministers of the new religion were the deac ons mentioned in the New Testament; the functions of bishop and p riest came later, the priest last of all. This would supp ose a very early origin for such a \"schoo l\" - as early as the Apostolic a ge. For the present, it will be found that eac h of the seven orders is allocated to its natural place upon the Ladder, with such attributes as properly belong to the degree of Holy order in"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"question, as described in the various ceremonies during which these degrees are bestowed. THE MINOR SEPHIROTH These a re mentioned in the notes which follow, and a few introductory remarks are needed. The section h eaded \"The 21 Stages of the Way\" (Part Two) is intended to illustrate their use in practical development. The diagram of the stages s hows an application to the Tree of Life in its more famili ar form. Other diagrams included in the present section show the same process as s een in eac h of the four worlds. Thus, eac h of the 32 Paths is also, comm encing with Path Four, representative of one or more minor sephiroth in eac h world in turn. Comparison of these diagrams with the diagram of the Ladder will m ake this clear. Appendices One a nd Two show how the diagram of the Ladder may be c ondensed into a \"Four-in-One\" diagram, and show how the traditional diagram of the Tree of Life is formed from the teac hing of the 32 Paths of Wisdom.

As has been mentioned elsewhere, the system m ay be studied on three levels. The first level relates to the major Sephiroth individually. The second level is the intermediate level of ascent via the return of the lightning flash. The third level, with which we a re more directly and most practically concerned, is illustrated by the twenty-one stages of the Way (Part Two). At all three levels, the Steps or stages of development are c onsidered in ascending order on the Tree of Life. Steps 1, 2 and 3 follow Malkuth, Yesod, Hod. At the c ompletion of step 3 the centre of Netzac h is reac hed, halfway into Step Four. This is a point of difficulty, shock or transition illustrated by path 27 of the Golden Dawn system and stage six of the twenty-one stages. Steps 4, 5 and 6 follow H od, Netzac h, Tiphareth. At the c ompletion of Step 6 the centre of Geburah is reac hed, halfway into Step 7 . This s econd shock p oint is illustrated in path 22 of the Golden Dawn system and stage fourteen of the 21 stages. Steps 7, 8 and 9 follow Tiphareth, Geburah, ' Hesed. At the c ompletion of Step 9 the centre of Binah is reac hed, halfway into Step 10 . This is the point called conception/death in Ouspensky teac hings. Step 10 follows ' Hesed only as far as the centre of Binah. (See the diagrams showing the breakdown of the Ladder). To complete this Step would be to become like Enoch, who \"walked with God and was not.\" This point is illustrated by Path 13 of the Golden Dawn system, and stage 21 of the 21 stages. Ten Steps are shown. There a re however only seven complete Sephiroth involved, as all teac hings, in their practical aspects, are sevenfold.

PATH FOU R The 4th Path is called the Arresting o r Rece iving Intelligence ( OQPSR OQPSR ). It arises like a bounda ry to rece ive the e mana tions of the higher intelligences which a re sent down to it. Herefrom all spiritual virtues emana te.

While Kether means crown, it is not the supreme crown, but the point of the ce ntre of the c ircle whose ce ntre is nowhere a nd its circumference e verywhere, or vice-versa. It is the first “crystallisation” of anything whatsoever from out of no-thing, from out of the great unmanifest which is veiled by three veils; hence “it arises like a boundary to rece ive the e manations of the higher Intelligences.” Path Four is also the ce ntre of the Greater Kether of the Ladder, which comprises the first seven of the 32 p aths. “It arises like a boundary to rece ive the e manations of the higher Intelligences.” That is to say that the “negative e xistence” - being, but being in n o-thing - concea led by three “veils,” ca uses there to emanate a point, called Kether in Kabbalah, “The Primordial Point,” referred in the four worlds to the “minor sephira” Kether in Atziluth. Path Four is the fourth part of the Greater Kether, and by its emanation, “all spiritual virtues emanate by way of subtlety, which itself emanates from the Supreme Crown.” The Supreme Crown is Ain, no-thing, the first Path, the roo t of “negative e xistence” or the unmanifest. Hence the point which “arises like a"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"boundary” to rece ive the higher emanations represents the “creation out of nothing” famili ar to theology. A comparison can b e made with eastern thought. Such a study could throw light on the mystery of “non-being” in such teac hings. The world of Atziluth or Emanation, corresponding to Heaven in Christian theology, comm ences at this point. Path Four is the first concentration of positive existence. It follows that there ca n b e no movement in creation until this arising occurs. While Kether is the Crown of Creation, ‘ Hokma is the first principle of energetic c reativity, as described in Part One, and may be c onsidered as the principle of undifferentiated energy within manifest Creation. The text of Path Four states that “ herefrom all spiritual virtues emanate by way of subtlety.” The Hebrew roo t of ‘ Hokma, Wisdom, is the first three letters of this word, and taken alone without the final Heh, is translated “subtlety.” The c onditions nece ssary for the development of the Greater Sephiroth b y way of emanation are implicit from the first moment of creative ac tivity heralded by Kether in Atziluth. We ca n see from the Ladder that as well as being the fourth part of the Greater Kether , this Path is also the first part of the Greater ‘ Hokma , and we find illustrated at the beginning of our study the doctrine that eac h sephira contains that which follows it in the order of emanation. It also follows that all ten sephiroth are ultimately contained within the Greater Kether, and constitute a unity with the Supreme Unity, the Supreme Crown.

Of the subjective or minor Sephiroth there a re ten in eac h world, plus Daath. As these Minor Sephiroth represent the rungs of the Ladder in the a scent of the Tree by developing awareness it must be said of them that they are subjective, as their importance to understanding lies in the relationship they bear to o urselves. Properly speaking they are Sephiroth only as a means of aiding our understanding, but based up on the principle that the true or Greater Sephiroth have their own principles reflected in all levels of creation. In reality they are simply paths, parts of the Greater Sephiroth, the objective Tree. In the subjective sense of minor Sephiroth they are a ll invisible. Daath means Knowledge - knowledge, not mere information ; not simply a collection of data. Knowledge c omes only from experience. Data ca n come from many sources. It is knowledge which “pours out a brilliant splendour on all intellectual virtues which are beheld with the e yes of the Spirit.” It is the seventh and final part of the Greater Kether."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"So exquisite is the subtlety of Kabbalah , and so acc urate in its reflections, that discerning students come to realise that the “invisibility” of Daath , and its mystery, is s hadowed or reflected in the a rrangement of the Minor Sephiroth within the four worlds, being a state of the development of awareness which as s oo n as it is reac hed d isappears, and becomes transformed into something else. This Path is the first appearance of any kind of Daath, as the “invisible” or “hidden intelligence” of the highest world of Atziluth. It is also the fourth part and central nucleus of the Greater ‘ Hokma, Wisdom, and we may justly say that at the heart of Wisdom li es Knowledge. It is this that “pours out a brilliant splendour,” e tc. Its appearance also tells us about the nature of knowledge itself. There has to be a n eye to see, with intellectual virtues etc. before the “hidden” knowledge may pour out its brilliant splendour. There has to be a knower to know. True knowledge is of the nature of realisation, to use a modern expression, or of revelation, to use one not so modern, but which in some respects is more acc urate a s a description of the nature of knowledge. Knowledge is more than an awareness of things; true knowledge is being, is consciousness itself.

This is the only instance where the Ladder has such a direct correspondence. In either case, this Path is imm ediately adjace nt to a form of Kether. The a rrangement of the Ladder is the more precise. In a general sense, Kether is certainly the \"cause of causes,\" but here the relationship is shown to be in the world of Briah, and the Kether of Briah is s pecified. To clarify this, some deeper understanding of Briah is nece ssary. The Hebrew word Briah means creation, or a thing created, and it is created things which are the ca use of effects in the phenomenal world with which we a re famili ar. It follows quite naturally that the Kether of Briah is itself, in such a c ontext, the \"cause of causes.\" This however is not enough to explain the a ttribution, and we need to loo k more closely at the text of the Path. It is also the \"veil place d before the order of the dispositions of the superior and inferior causes.\" This makes the matter clearer, for we ca n see that the superior causes will be those of the world of Atziluth , and the inferior causes those of the world of Briah , one step removed, and it is therefore the ca use of the \"inferior\" or lower causes that is referred to, i.e., Kether in Briah .

Comm entary: The Foundation of Heaven. The Knowledge of Paradise. This is one of the most important of the 32 Paths, so far as the possibility of human development is concerned. One is tempted to play the Kabbalistic game of Gematria, and observe that the Hebrew Achad, unity, adds up, by the sum of its letters, to 31, which reduced numerologically, equals 4, the sum of the 1 and 3 of Path 13. Further, the temptation also exists to o bserve that 13 is a “mirror image” of 31, and therefore may symbolise perfectly the process of induction implicit in the text. For a spiritual person this is the most holy place of all, for it is from here that we rece ive the highest possible benediction in this world. Kabbalah, we a re told, was first taught to humanity by the a ngels, and it is in Paradise that the angels are said to work. If we have the knowledge of Paradise, then it becomes possible for us to contact, and even converse with the a ngels. But as may be seen from the place of this Path upon the Ladder, and from the a ttributions given above, this is an exalted p lace to be, and an exalted state to achieve. It is “inductive of unity,” that is to say that unity is called forth from above to this"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"place , for those that succe ssfully lift their awareness to this level, and it “manifests truth to every spirit.” Note: to every spirit, not to every soul, nor every body. This Path is truly “esoteric,” that is, for the few w ho can reac h it. It is not however therefore reserved for some special “elect” - the e rror of the gnostics - but is freely available to all through the descent of the Holy Spirit. Indeed, this is the place of this descent, however we regard the process, and also the place of the offering up of the individual spirit for spiritual service, however we understand that service. In the body of a Christian cruciform cathedral or abbey church, it is the only part of the building symbolically in the world of Atziluth, the only place where c ontact with h eavenly things may be found. It is the very foundation of heaven, in which we may find d ivinity within us. It has also been described as the knowledge of paradise, which can b e a highly technical term. Knowledge is only possible by experience, and we may, when we know how, experience the state of paradise, if only temporarily, here. Here a lso we may rece ive directly the inspiration of Holy Spirit in full consciousness, an experience never to be forgotten, and which can change our whole life. So much may be said regarding this Path, that the mind can b e overwhelmed by the implications. The student is advised therefore to study the implications personally, to consider, to contemplate, to meditate, and to seek to understand the awe- ful m ystery of the “Inductive Intelligence of Unity.” As the work is done, so truth will i ndeed be manifest to o ur individual spirit, and we will hesitate to speak of it. Like the sun whose symbol is place d here, the light of Spirit may shine within us. We will then n eed to learn h ow to “let our light shine” without “casting p earls before swine.” This can only be done by learning at the same time to rece ive the truth which is manifest to the spirit and allowing the Spirit, not the person, to speak.

Note that this Path follows upon the rece ipt of the power of truth, of the Holy Spirit, and is called the foundation of holiness. Holiness is a human quality which cannot begin to be manifest until the influence of the spirit reac hes downward and outward into humanity.

At the base, or foundation, the “ Yesod” point of Tiphareth , lies Path 22, the “Faithful Intelligence.” Of this Path it is said that “Spiritual virtues are deposited therein, until they pass to those who dwell under the shadow thereof.” The two texts quoted speak for themselves in describing the nature a nd function of this Sephira. Path 22 has been described as the “first gate” or “shock” point which arises beca use of attempts to awaken. It is also Kether in Assiah, so it can b e seen that the Greater Tiphareth serves to bring through the final expression of divinity,"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"the “delight of glory” (Path 16) the Malkuth of Atziluth, the Realm of the Spiritual world, into o ur own material Realm of Assiah. It transmits this influence by its existence a s a bridge in Briah and Yetzirah from the lowest part of Spirit to the highest part of matter, Kether in Assiah - the divine spark in the material world. Thus is divinity brought to humanity, and is deposited within eac h member of the human race , and within every manifestation of creation. In Freemasonry, said to b e represented b y the 15th Degree, \"Knight of the Sword\" - note that the Hebrew letter zain Ð Ð which means \"sword\" is also p laced here. PATH TWENTY The 20th Path is called the Intelligence of Will ( Ñ\u0002Ò\rÓ\u0002Ô\u0007Õ Ñ\u0007Ò\rÓ\u0002Ô\u0002Õ ) . It prepares all created beings, each individua lly, for the demonstration o f the primordial glory. Sepher Yetzirah: The letter Chet Ö Ö governs in Speec h, Cancer in the universe, Tamuz in the year, and the left foo t in h uman b eings. The Minor Sephiroth: ‘ Hesed in Yetzirah. The Christian Church: The lighted candle of the Acolyte. The Tarot: Card nine, the “Hermit.” Comm entary: The “primordial glory” is Path One, called the “first splendour” a nd symbolised by “the light which imparts understanding of the beginning.” In ordination of a Christian Acolyte, this light is symbolised by the lighted candle which the ca ndidate ca rries to the altar, and represents the will to serve. At the same time, it may be regarded as representative of that particle of the primordial light which the ca ndidate is, and which constitutes the personal divinity, the presence of the spiritual essence. This throws s ome light upon the nature of human will. Ordinarily, we tend to equate will with desire, supp osing that if we desire a particular thing, that our will i s operating to o btain it. We should k now this is not invariably the ca se, and we often realise with h indsight that our true will m ade sure that we did not, in a given instance, obtain the desire, which could have been h armful to us. Ordinarily, and nece ssarily, will i s not obviously active in us, and it is part of our"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"work to learn h ow, when n ece ssary, to contact our own will. When this happens, we begin to realise that we a re much more than we supp osed we were, and at the same time, much less. We have ca ught a glim pse of divinity in us, and we may become, by so doing, if not at the first instance, “anointed” by the e xperience. The Greek word Christos rendered as “Christ” in the New Testament, means “anointed [one]” a s does M essiah in Hebrew, and such an experience may herald the appearance of what has been called “Christ in you.” Such an appearance is a nece ssary preparation for the demonstration to any of us of the e xistence of the primordial glory. PATH TWENTY-ON E The 21st Path is called the Intelligence of Desire ( ( ×\u0002Ø\u0002Ù\rÚ\rÛ\u0007ÜBÝ\u0002Þ\rß\tà Ü ×\u0007Ø\u0002Ù\rÚ\rÛ\u0002ÜBÝ\u0002Þ\rß\tàáÜ ) , or the Rewarding Intelligence. It rece ives the divine influence, and so influences all living things. Sepher Yetzirah: The letter Teth â â governs in Eating, Leo in the universe, Av in the year, and the right kidney in h uman b eings. The Minor Sephiroth: Geburah in Yetzirah. The Christian Church: The candle- holder of the Acolyte. The Tarot: Card ten, the “W heel.” Comm entary: One of the e soteric orders derived from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn attributed the right arm to Geburah, and the “candle-holder” of an Acolyte is held in the right hand. At ordination h owever, the left hand is brought to join the right, presenting the lighted candle to the bishop, symbolising the subordination of the human to the divine will, and in Kabbalist symbolism the balancing of both pillars of the Tree of Life. PATH TWENTY-TWO NET ZACH is centred in, and is the ce ntral Sephira of Yetzirah. At the same time, it is half in Briah and half in Assiah. As Geburah transmits s piritual im petus through form i nto formation, so Netzac h transmits form, through formation, toward material m anifestation. Path 22 is its central point."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The 22nd Path is called the Faithful Intelligence ( ã\u0002ä\u0002å\u0002æ ã\u0002ä\u0007å\u0002æ ) .

Comm entary: Realm of Paradise; Heart of Purgatory ; Crown of Hades. Path 22 is the ce ntre of the Greater Netzac h. This is the point of creation where we, as mortal beings, are normally aware of it, if we a re a ware of it at all. The world of appearances with which we a re famili ar at its lower levels has its roo ts, in other words, in the Sephira Netzac h. This might acc ount, acc ording to the view of Netzac h h eld by some, for the repetitive nature of this lower world. Such a recognition of the constantly recurring cycles of birth, maturity, deca y, and d eath, is often the starting p oint of those who loo k for deeper explanations of things. Eventually, such enquiry brings the e nquirer to search within, at which point the a ssociation of this Path with a Christian Acolyte is appropriate, for it is here that the Acolyte may first rece ive “light from above” a fter the manner of the text. When the spiritual virtues deposited within h ave duly augmented, the Acolyte will understand the significance of this position at the Malkuth of Briah, and be ready to comm ence further training. At this s tage, we a re, as one a uthor put it, “ Hewers of woo d and d rawers of water” - that is to say, willing seekers glad to serve in the temple of the Spirit.

The Tarot: Card twelve, the “Hanged Man.” Comm entary: Netzac h, here seen in the world of Yetzirah, is called, apart from “Victory” - the translation of “ Netzac h” - by the title of Firmness, which echoes the idea of stability sugg ested by the text. As it is also “ Hokma in Assiah, we might say that the wisdom of the material world is characterised by a certain inner firmness, something which may be observed as a factor in the character of many succe ssful people.

The Tarot: Card thirteen, “Death.” Comm entary: “The Imaginative Intelligence, which is the ground of simil arity in the likeness of beings who are created acc ording to its agreement” is the imaginative Hod faculty of Yetzirah at the same time a s it is the understanding of the material. There is a double a ssociation with the c oncept of death h ere in the tarot card and the sign Scorpio, which in astrology is associated with the eighth h ouse, the house of death. The understanding and intelligence of Kabbalah makes it clear that death is not regarded as a finality, but as a transitional process, for by associating it with Binah in Assiah , where we may assign the process of physical death, it also relates it to Hod in Yetzirah , into which the physical m ay be transformed in another form of existence. Note that the text of this Path is concerned with created beings - such as ourselves. Note a lso that Kabbalah does not place death where we might expect it, i.e., at the end of things, but at an intermediate point. The Tarot takes the same view, for it is only the thirteenth card of twenty-two. In this comm entary on the Ladder we a re referring to a downward p rogression through the thirty-two Paths of Wisdom, so that it may not be a ppropriate to go deeply into this question h ere, for the process which describes the transformation described as death is in the nature of an upward p rogression through the worlds, and can also be loo ked at on the scale of the twenty-one stages of Part Two, or alternatively by regarding the symbolism of the tarot in its own terms from the"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"first to the last card, where the subsequent stages may be e xamined and p ondered upon.

The 25th Path is called the Intelligence of Temptation o r Trial ( ñ\rò\ró\rñ\rô\u0002ò ñ\rò\ró\rñ\rô\u0007ò ) because it i s the first temptation b y which God tests the devout.

Daath in Assiah . The Christian Church: The station of the Exorcist. The Tarot: Card fourteen, “Temperance” or “The Angel.” Yoga: The Svaddhisthana chakra , in the genital region. Mantra: VAM. Comm entary: This Path is the ce ntre of the Greater Hod, which is also the first of the Greater Sephiroth entirely in the world of Assiah, and is, for the student, the most important of the Greater Sephiroth. A complete boo k could be written about this Sephira a lone, and while we a re in the flesh, we a re c oncerned with its activity for the e ntire period of our earthly lives. This adds an almost ominous s ignificance to the text of the Path. It explains the importance of the function of exorcism as properly understoo d, which has little to do with the e xpulsion of demons, and more to do with h ealing. Sagittarius is the sign of the house which rules philosophy and religion, and Kabbalah is both of these.

The Christian Church: The Boo k of Epistles. The Tarot: Card fifteen, the “Devil.” Comm entary: “Thereby God reneweth all which is capable of renovation in the c reation of the world.” One day the Children of God came to attend up on the Eternal, and among them was Satan. So the Eternal said to Satan: Where have you been? “ Round the ea rth,” he answered, “roaming about.” So the Eternal asked: Did you notice my servant Job? There is no o ne like him on the ea rth ; a sound and honest man who fears God and shuns evil. “Yes,” said Satan, “but Job is not God-fearing for nothing, is he?

The Devil showed him all the dominions of the world and their splendour. `I will give you all of these,’ he said , `if you worship me.’ Jesus replied: Be off Satan!” These instances s how a far different picture of the satanic role than that depicted in the popular imagination, or, for that matter, in many theological or church circles.

The e ntire system of Sun, Moo n and Planets may be simil arly regarded, as eac h is also a body of a different kind, with its own spiritual essence.

Centrally on the Tree is the well-known and much referred to veil of Paroketh , which v eils the full li ght of Tiphareth or Self-consciousness until such time a s the Yesod -based personality is s ufficiently prepared, when it may form a firm foundation ( Yesod ) for the power of Self without becoming d isoriented, at which stage the veil of Tiphareth , analogous to Ain Suph , is breac hed, and the a spirant begins consciously to BE. Lowest on the Tree, analogous to Ain Suph Aur, is the rarely- mentioned veil of Yesod, which shields the higher worlds of Yetzirah, Briah and Atziluth from the sleeping consciousness in Assiah. Below this veil, the “soul” is said to be a sleep (Jesus, less kindly perhaps, said “dead”) and entirely personality- based, mechanistic, governed by action/reac tion. Individuals wondering about their place in the scheme of things create impulses towards the upp er part of Yesod , the dualistic “moo n” Sephira , which may in time result in the comm encement of the Way, where the individual becomes an aspirant t o the knowledge of higher things, and this veil is thereby breac hed.

APP END IX 4 WAK ING U P T O LIFE ( or, It may not be Aun tie Lulu) 1. The Human Trinity We a ll tend to think of ourselves as s ingle, unique individuals, and essentially this is true. What we may be mostly unaware of is that our human n ature during our passage through this world of time a nd space is a c omposite of three basic natures, only one of which may be regarded as the e ssential “I” for eac h one of us. Religion h as classified this threefold nature a s consisting of body, soul, and spirit, which is as convenient a way as any to think of it. The way in which these terms are used here may not coincide with the orthodox religious view, but it is one which may be verified by experience, whereas much of the religious thought properly belongs in the realm of philosophy, which in its practical expression is more c oncerned with ideas and hypotheses than with v erifiable e xperience. Body Firstly then, let us consider eac h of these three ca tegories s eparately. The human body is an incredibly complex mechanism, and modern science has discovered things about it and its components which make miracles loo k like party tricks. This has led some people to regard the totality of the human b eing as no more than an incredibly complex and wonderful expression of our multi-miracled physical nature. Body is composed, as most of us know, of this extraordinary complicated arrangement of flesh, bones, bloo d, and nerves, all of which are fed in v arious and often subtle ways. Mostly, however, it is s elf-regulating, and once we have taught it to walk and talk, we ca n safely rely on it to take us to and from the place s we wish to visit, be it the kitchen or some far country on the other side of the globe. Stop for a moment and consider your own b ody. Are you your legs? Your arms? Your liver? Hair, ears, eyes? Very simple observation makes it imm ediately apparent that you are none of these things. Are you any two, three, or four of them bundled together? Clearly not. Why then should we supp ose that however"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"we a dd up the various physical components of the human b ody, its totality of parts adds up to being you or me or anyone e lse? So, though we may eac h, individually, be genuinely unique in that I am not you and you are not me, we a re c learly not our bodies. We have bodies, it is true, and perhaps beca use no two bodies are identical in every respect (not even in the ca se of “identical” twins) we tend easily to identify with them. When a friend or loved one dies, we speak of their r emains being d isposed of in personal terms. We say that so-and-so, using his or her name, has been b urned or cremated, but this is not true, it IS only their REMAINS that have been so treated. They are demonstrably no longer present. Body, then, may be regarded as an incredible a nd wonderful m achine by means of which we a re a ble to move a bout and experience the world, but that is all it is. It is not us, but a valuable possession which serves us as well as it can, but only for our natural life span in the world. To use a modern term, its “shelf life” rarely excee ds a hundred years. Sou l Soul is often regarded as being the e ssential, imm ortal or eternal part of our nature which we ca n clearly and truly identify as “I”. Unfortunately the term “Spirit” is also used in the same way by different people, so that it is essential to understand the way in which the use of the word soul is employed here. Mystics, psychics and others have for a long time spoken about a second “body” of an “ethereal” nature, which h as also been given v arious names, such as the “astral” or “ etheric” body. That such a FORM (to distinguish it from our use of “body”) exists is virtually undeniable. To people who have had conscious experience of it its existence it is totally undeniable! Quite ordinary people have had what is called the “Out of the body” e xperience, so o ur testimony does not depend up on the witness of mystics and p sychics alone. Under ordinary circumstances this s ubtle form m ay indeed be regarded as analogous to a second “body” but there is more to it than just this function. In appearance it is often described as a kind of misty replica of the physical with which it normally coincides and interpenetrates. The out of the body experience occurs when someone wakes up in this s ubtle form at a time when this coincidence of place is not happening. The most startling experience to have is to be in this condition and from i t to be a ble to loo k at one’s own physical body lying asleep in the bed, breathing away as usual - snoring even - and to realise that you are not in it, but somewhere outside it, in another state of being. This other state of being, where we e xist in this s ubtle form i n-dependently of the physical, is what is meant here by “soul”. Or rather the subtle form i tself is “soul”. Beca use of the c onfusion in many people’s minds between the terminology of soul and spirit, we shall use a term which is in fact found throughout t he Hebrew scriptures (the “Old Testament”). The reason for using this term, NEPHESH, is that this s eems to have been precisely what it meant to the a ncient Hebrews. When we read the English word “soul” in our translations of the boo ks of the Hebrew"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"scriptures, we a re a lmost certainly reading a translation of this very word. This s ubtle form, this Nephesh or soul, appears to subsist for a time a fter the death of the physical body, but is essentially linked to it during earthly life, and is possibly another energy source for the physical. This s ubtle form, the Nephesh, separates from the physical to a greater or lesser degree during sleep. When a person separates s ome distance from the physical in this s tate, and then wakes up, then this is when we e xperience one form of the out of the body experience. Under normal everyday circumstances however the two “bodies” - the physical and the Nephesh - clearly work in tandem. The Eastern system of “ chakras” or “psychic ce ntres” relates to the Nephesh, and we shall return to this later on. To be more acc urate, it is not a “system” a t all, but a description of psychic fact. It is interesting to o bserve that the word p sychic a lso concerns the “soul”, as it derives from the Greek word PS YCHE, also translated as “soul” in the scriptures. It is also the roo t of the word “psychology”. Spirit Spirit, as used here, actually does refer to the e ssential, imm ortal, eternal human essence which eac h one of us IS. For the moment there is little more to be said about it, except to say that it is the Spirit which HAS a Nephesh, and which HAS a body. 2. The Human Animal That’s what t he body is - an animal, a beast or creature a mong the other mamm alian creatures s uch as apes, dolphins and whales. Furthermore, our bodies have a limi ted intelligence of their own, an intelligence which is of a very basic nature. Its main requirements are simply foo d, warmth, shelter, and sex. Without the a nimating Nephesh which actually makes it both alive a nd human, it is no more than a c ollection of meat, bones, bloo d, nerves and so o n. In a sense it might be said that we, as human b eings, are parasites living within this animal host. Clearly we have to treat it with a reasonable a mount of care a nd respect, as without it we ca nnot function in this material world at all. At the same time, it quite c learly has a will of its own, as well as needs, desires, and functions which can more often than n ot be a definite nuisance in our attempts to follow our own will i n preference to its. Even astronauts exploring the glories of space have to make provision for urinating and the passing of excrement! Such is the paradoxical grandeur of the human race a nd its achievements. However, provided we make suitable a nd sensible provision for the body’s needs, it makes little demands upon us, and we a re free to use it to explore the wonders of planet Earth. And it is our temporary stay upon planet Earth which is the main concern of this treatise. We may well - and d o - speculate on where we were before we were born, or where we will be a fter death, but in the meantime there is plenty to do, a great deal to explore, exciting (and not so exciting) things to discover and learn. Discovery and learning - are these not the main preoccupations of all of us? Did you ever meet a human b eing who did not want to know about something?"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The a nimal creature with whom we have a sometimes uneasy alliance may share a certain amount of this curiosity with us, but its version is s everely limi ted to those basic needs mentioned above. Ours is far more c omplicated and ingenious. Let’s put it this way: the a nimal will be c ontent to discover the nearest corn-field, grab the husks of wheat, just as they are, and stuff them i nto its mouth. The human soul or Nephesh dwelling in and along-side it will, in the c ourse of the same discovery, eventually go o n to invent t he pop-up toaster. The greater part of our human existence therefore is clearly determined by the needs and curiosities of the Nephesh or soul nature by means of which we a re a ble to co-exist in a uniquely human way with the c reature. Human Mechan ics By and large then, the human b ody can safety be left to take ca re of itself, sending us appropriate information as and when it sees its needs as being neglected, as in the need for foo d and warmth for example, or if it is a state of disorder, when it sends us s ignals of pain or distress. Beca use we spend our lives s urrounded by the manifestations of material existence, we fondly sup-pose that we live in the “real” material world. All we e ver see, however, is the outward appearance of things, their surface s. When we loo k at a tree, we do not see the inside of the trunk, or the sap - the life bloo d of the tree - r ising and falling; nor do we see the internal workings of the other human b odies among which we pass from day to day. Obvious as this is, it is true to say that even if we c ould, we would still be seeing only y et another surface a ppearance, for science has demonstrated that in the material world, even within the surface of the imm ediately interior object - such as the ordinary human h eart - there is a material activity of molecules and atoms which can only be seen with the a id of another material, mechanical device such as a microscope, with its interior molecules and atoms. What we a re most unlikely to see in any of these things is the life- energy which gives those same molecules and atoms their ability to function. What we have been able to discover is that all these things are subject to laws, eac h acc ording to its kind. ( cf. the Creation acc ounts in the Boo k of Genesis). Essentially, therefore, the human b ody, with its incredible c omplexity, is a mechanical device a nimated by - WHAT? How much of the “real” world d o we ac tually see? Very little, most of the time, unless perhaps we a re in a strange place whose surroundings are unfamili ar to us. In our own neighborhoo d, are we normally aware of the local tree, with or without its s ap, or is our attention elsewhere? It is elsewhere, invariably occupied with thoughts and images circling round in the mind. 3. The Human Mind What is this mind? It is clearly more than the a ggregate of human b rain and nerve activity, though damage to these a reas can seemingly affect its ability to"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"comm unicate quite seriously. However, it has been established that people who are physically paralysed or otherwise disabled and u nable to comm unicate beca use of such damage, are likely as not as lucid and intelligent - sometimes more so - as anyone e lse. We have a ll seen television programs which demonstrate this, where someone with an apparently crippling complaint has been able to demonstrate that there is nothing wrong with their minds whatever, once we have been able to provide them with mechanical or electronic a ids which compensate for their disability. Mind, then, is clearly not dependent upon totally efficient physical mechanisms in order both to function and to exist. Mind is a function of Nephesh , or soul; and beca use most of our waking lives - and p robably a large part of that one third of our lives we spend sleeping - are spent engaged in mental activity, the living human b eing is, in fact, not a physical creature a t all, at least, not as ordinarily understoo d. Anyone ca n easily demonstrate this fact for themselves. When we a re on our way to the local shopping mall, passing trees and other famili ar landmarks, our attention, our thoughts, our imaginings - these a re a head of us, already at t he store, buying various items, debating which ones to get, picturing ourselves actually taking items from the shelves, calculating the c ost, etc. The e xistence of the local tree occupies only a minimal part of our attention, and then only in passing. In short, we a re not, in the ordinary course of events, fully aware of our material surroundings at all. We live, as the popular saying recognises, “in a world of our own.” Motivation What we perceive a s mental activity, be it t hinking in words or imaging (imagining) in pictures, is an activity operating within the soul, the Nephesh, and it is this activity which “animates” the body. When we a re very small babies we have no control to speak of over our bodies. As we learn, by responding to the various s timuli we rece ive from our parents, guardians, and surroundings, we a re rece iving information directly into Nephesh, and are a ble to form im ages and sounds to imi tate. Thus we become a ble to walk and talk, and increasingly, to think, to reason and calculate. For example, by watching the way in which other people walk, the c hild takes the image of this into its mind; the imm ediate result of this is translated d irectly to the body, which attempts to dup licate what the image has informed it. Gradually the body learns, and we begin to take our first wobbly steps in the material world. The same process is repeated for all other human activity, increasing in complexity and subtlety for all of the nece ssary activities of everyday life a s we grow older. The innate human curiosity which, in many ways, actually identities us as human beings rather than some other species, does, from quite a n early age, begin to use its imaging facility for speculation, and becomes able to do what we ordinarily call imagination, whereby we a re ac tually able to postulate images in the mind/soul/ nephesh of objects and scenarios which do not, and p ossibly cannot"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"exist. Imagine a pigeon with a c ow’s head - anyone ca n do this. Imagine winning the lottery, or inheriting a fortune - easy, fun - but unlikely. First thoughts A little intelligent observation will soo n show us that the first kind of thought we have is, in fact, an image, a picture in the mind. Once we have learned to talk, using language to describe the picture that we image, we have discovered a kind of shorthand labelling method. For example, the word “pigeon” used above ca lls up from m emory the whole bird, complete with feathers, stick-like legs, beak, and funny walk. Substituting the c ow’s head for that of the pigeon involves a whole series of complex imagining, but we ca n do it, using the same basic mechanism, provided of course we a lready have images of pigeons and cows in our memories. As we grow older, the use of this language shorthand becomes s econd nature to us, so that the transition from im age to “thought” is s o fast as to be imperceptible. What we mostly perceive a s first thoughts are, in fact, second thoughts! Making a n Impression While the body provides us with the means of moving around in the world, the nephesh-soul-mind activity provides the means of identification and comm unication concerning what we discover in it. There is a definite a nd clear sequence to this activity which fairly simple observation of our own b ehaviour will soo n demonstrate. Whatever we e ncounter in our experience of the world makes an impression upon us - we ac tually use this expression to describe this activity in comm on speec h, though only when the impression made seems to us to be particularly striking. It is worthwhile reflecting on the c olloquial use of language, which often seems to instinctively describe quite acc urately what is actually taking p lace . Making an impression, in another context, is as when, for example, we leave our fingerprints in a piece of wax or simil ar material. Later we ca n re-examine the wax and find the record we have left there. So it is with the multitude of impressions we rece ive e very day. It seems that, in a quite literal sense, all the objects and p eople we e ncounter leave a n impression in the subtle “body” we have ca lled Nephesh. This is the basis of reca ll and the a bility to remember things and p eople. First Impressions Here is another everyday term with which we a re a ll famili ar. What happens with “first impressions?”"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"In b asic terms, a simple process imm ediately ensues. Under average c onditions we encounter an object or person, sound or sensation, which, on making its impression, causes an imm ediate reac tion in us. The e ssential quality of “first impressions” that we a re a ll famili ar with is s umm ed up in sayings s uch as: “My first impression was that I didn’t like the loo k of them.” “Something about them didn’t feel right.” “She gave me a goo d feeling.” The impressions events and p eople make upon us are rece ived by us, in the first instance, as a feeling or feelings. Basically, our reac tion is invariably a greater or lesser degree of “like” or “don’t like.” At the same time this feeling is translated into an image which approximates to the nature of the impression. Consider that the Nephesh is s omething like the wax: in making the impression, there is a direct reac tion from the wax to the pressure we have place d up on it with our fingers. Any impression we rece ive ac ts in a simil ar way - it “makes a dent” in the Nephesh. We a re, to use a nother well-known phrase, “impression-able.” The most important thing to note however about these first impressions is that of “like” or “dislike” - a reac tion which does not depend up on reason or logic. This is beca use the first part of the impression process goes directly to o ur memory store of images for imm ediate c omparison. If, for example, we have been h urt, whether physically or emotionally by something in our experience which merely resembles the image of the impression we a re rece iving, then our “first impression” will be one of dislike. Simil arly, if the memory store c omes up with pleasantly simil ar images, then our reac tion will be one of liking. Only after this process has taken place - which takes minute fractions of a second - do we refer the impression to the ordinary intellectual m echanism, whose principal function is to search its memory store for suitable labels with which to name the impression. If, for instance, the impression is that of a person whom perhaps we have not met before, the label that may be delivered to o ur awareness may be something like, “simil ar to Auntie Lulu.” BUT - and this is an important “but” - the label we rece ive will have a lready been conditioned by how w e feel about Auntie Lulu in the first place . Only after the like/dislike mechanism has operated, and a tentative label has been assigned to it will we ac tually do anything. The basic process then is “Impression - like/dislike - label (identify) - act.” It follows that, in the e xample a bove, we will recognise that t he person from whom we a re rece iving is not actually Auntie Lulu, but someone who resembles her. But “Auntie Lulu” is an emotionally affected label, and in consequence our behaviour towards the strange but simil ar lady will be a ffected acc ordingly, and we will suspect that she will have some of the attributes which we have a ssigned to Auntie Lulu. If we like Auntie Lulu, we will tend to act in a friendly manner to this lady, as if we e xpect her to behave in a simil ar manner to Auntie. If otherwise, we shall be more ca utious about her, and we dislike Auntie Lulu intensely, we may even avoid"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"her completely. It is, of course, highly unlikely that this lady will resemble Auntie Lulu anything like a s much as we imagine, or even at all. It is, however, extremely probable that given the a bove scenario - which we ca n investigate a nd verify by observing our own n ature a nd behaviour - that we rarely see the “real world” a s it actually is at all; that we rarely relate to o ther people a s they really are in their own true natures; that all we see a nd experience is interpreted by the mechanism of the human personality in terms of our previous experience a nd acquired p rejudices. In short, we a re living in a world of imagination, endowing our environment with attributes it may or may not possess, and even if it does, probably not in the way we imagine. In short, we spend most of our lives daydreaming; we a re, in a manner of speaking, “asleep” but believing we a re “awake” - an approach used by the philosopher and esoteric teac her P.D.Ouspensky. If, then, I say that under these c ircumstances I am “asleep” then who is this “I” who sleeps? It is not the “I” of the personality ego-mechanism, but the “I” of the soul. In short, Nephesh sleeps, and I am, in a large measure, a walking, living, breathing automaton. What price “choice” a nd “freedom” if these a re e xercised under such circumstances? Clearly we have little of either. The remedy is s imple - we must discover how to “wake up” a s Nephesh, as “Soul”. Only then do we have the c hance to make real choices and exercise genuine freedom. Wa king up This is where we c ome to the practical side of this s tudy, and this work, with the emphasis on work. Most things worth achieving require e ffort - it is nece ssary to put the theory into practice. (There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch). You will reca ll that earlier on it was s aid that all that has been described may be verified by experience. This experience, however, does not come for the a sking - it is nece ssary to go and g et it. In this s ection, and by way of a temporary conclusion, we shall describe the first steps that anyone ca n take on their own, to put the theory to the test. When the prelimi nary work has been b egun, and has become a natural activity which can b e undertaken at any time simply by remembering to do it, then it is possible to move on to a deeper understanding leading to a greater know-ledge of one’s true nature and identity. This next level of working is, by its very nature, not something that can b e written down as a simple set of instructions, and needs to be followed under supervision, In company with others who are travelling on the same road, which is why we ca n only reac h a temporary conclusion h ere. Like most disciplines, the practice which can b e given h ere begins with learning how to quieten the cea seless mental activity of the labelling mechanism, which is chattering away all the time like a monkey in our heads. The first step"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Choo se a quiet time, where you can feel and be relaxed. If possible, sit upright on a straight-backed chair, and let the e yes close. Give your attention first of all to your body. Feel its weight on the c hair, the texture of your clothing u nder your hands, wherever they are resting, and be a ware of the sensation of your clothing touching your body underneath. Feel the floo r beneath your feet - maybe you will want to take your shoes off. Once you have e stablished a c lear awareness of your own physical nature, then relax as much as possible. Take two o r three deep breaths to help the relaxation process. Now let t he e yes close. This is a subtle, but useful point: do not positively shut the e yes, but simply allow the lids to gently lower themselves. Now - listen. Just that: in the very ordinary way, just as you might when enjoying a piece of music, allow the various s ounds in the roo m - a c lock ticking, perhaps, to take your attention. Extend this hearing activity to include a s much as possible of whatever sounds there may be within earshot - traffic outside in the street, perhaps a bird singing, a dog barking - whatever there is physically to hear. Very soo n you are likely to find yourself having various thoughts about t he sounds you hear, and qu ite possibly wandering off into the daydream we spoke of earlier, so that you stop being aware of the sounds around you. Whenever this happens, and however often it happens, STOP IT. Start again from the beginning (although it is not nece ssary to o pen your eyes again) and g ive your attention to the physical sensations, and then the sounds around you. It is important t o note that t he purpose of this practice is not t o achieve a n imm ediate objective, such as remaining fully aware of your physical situation and the sounds round about without interruption for as long as possible. Indeed, the main v alue of this practice is to become famili ar with the way in which the intellectual labelling mechanism keeps taking you over and causing you to slide unconsciously into daydream, and to learn to stop it from doing so when you wish to. Every time you notice this has happened, you have woken up for a moment, and in so doing, you very quickly become a ware of your own situation and the noises in your vicinity - the genuine “real world!” Practice this exercise a bout twice a day if you can, for about ten minutes at a time. Gradually y ou will become more proficient at catching yourself “falling asleep” and g oing into daydreams, and every time you d o this you will have woken up a little more. The same bu t different Another way of practising what is essentially the same technique is to apply the same principle to the ordinary activities of everyday life. This, at least to begin with, is more ea sily done out of doo rs. There a re several ways of applying this technique, of which we shall give two. With practice, you will begin to discover other ways of applying it that are suited to your own situation and temperament. First, then, find a suitable outdoo r location - it can b e a lmost anywhere, so long as"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"you can find a suitable place to sit down. A park bench perhaps, a low w all, even a seat in the local shopping centre. Practice the same e xercise a s you d id (and are certainly still doing) when indoo rs, except that this time you k eep the e yes open while listening, and at t he same time give your attention to what you can see around you as well. Again, whenever thoughts intrude a nd begin to take over, STOP THEM. You will have woken up again. If the place you have c hosen h as a goo d view, then extend your visual awareness as far as the e ye ca n see, and endeavour to visually take in as much as possible, all at once. Do not let your attention fasten on to any specific sound or object, but without going off into a daydream, keep the a ttention as wide a s possible. Once a gain, but this time more so, you will find yourself wide a wake in the real world! The second form of this exercise is essentially the same a s the first, except that having g rasped the basic practice through the previous listening and seeing exercises you learn to o pen your attention up as wide a s possible whilst walking to or from a place which is a regular destination, in or out of doo rs, though like the previous version, it is more e ffective outside than in, as there is more to see a nd hear, more to be a ware of. Gradually, or even n ot so gradually, you will appreciate more a nd more the joy of simply being alive a nd p resent! You are a wake! Having experienced this, you will readily appreciate that there is one thing that no boo k, no lecture, can ever do: it cannot t ell you what it feels like, for that is something that can only be e xperienced. It is a subject for doing, not for talking or thinking about. It is a waking up to life."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Chu rch and Temple Su pp lement THE LADD ER, THE CHU RC H, AND FREE MASON RY Some time a round the latter part of the 11th all of the 12th century, and a little way into the 13th, the great Abbey and Cathedral churches of Europe began to be built. No o ne ca n say with any degree of certainty why this work began when it did, but we ca n with certainty draw attention to a number of coincidences attached to it. Firstly, by this time it was certain that the great Christian Crusades, in the service of the Roman Catholic Church, to take the \"Holy Land\" of Palestine by force for \"Christendom\" had failed. What cannot have failed to o ccur during a ce ntury of combat between the warrior knights of Europe a nd the inhabitants of the land they sought to conquer was a large degree of contact and even fraternization. Their main enemy was Islam, the religion of Mohamm ed, but then, as now, there were a large number of Jews living and worshipping there. That some of the c ontact will have involved a sharing of religious concepts and beliefs is equally likely to have occurred. On the Islamic side there was a strong alchemical tradition among some of the peoples of the Islamic, Arabic-speaking countries. On the Jewish side there was the long and strong traditions of Jewish mysticism, of which Kabbalah would have formed a major component, even if the term i tself were not yet in use - though with the publication of the Zohar before too long, the word would qu ickly enter the e soteric, occult, and mystical languages. The c rusades being over, those in positions of influence a nd p ower (for a short time when the outcome loo ked more hopeful) will have returned to their various European h omes. Did they, perhaps, bring back something more with them than their rusting shields and blunted swords? Whether they did or not we ca nnot say, but it demonstrable from the geometry of the new Abbeys and Cathedrals that they, or their contemporaries, began laying out the plan of \"Jacob's Ladder\" as delineated in these pages acc ording to the e xact"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"proportions we have shown. Originally, all these buildings would have had a monastic foundation, and by virtue of this, have been the only schoo ls of their time. Admittance to such schoo ls was not a state requirement or even a state concession, but was governed solely by the c onsiderations and need of the Church. In n early all of the e xamples s o far examined, there is the e quivalent, in Christian terms, of the porchway entrance of King Solomon's Temple, though defined in a different way. Although the Abbey Church was entered through the West Doo r, there was a lobby imm ediately inside where, we c ould supp ose, potential catechumens might wait - maybe for some time – a decision on their acce ptance or rejection b y the establishment. In this area is s ome c hurches, including local parish churches, would have been found the initiation essential, the baptismal font. It is s till i n this location in many an old English country church, although the fashion is to have it closer to the a ltar in more modern times. Once initiated, the spiritual entrance was open, and so we find that Path 32 of the Ladder is often just inside the building. Supp osing, for the sake of conjecture, that the Church knew it was building an exact and meaningful symbol of the a ncient mystery teac hing, then might it not have required a work force that had to be given at least some of the secrets of that teac hing in order to ensure that the building work was constructed exactly as required, rather than the a pproximation that even today acc ompanies the work of master builders? Bearing in mind the a lmost total power of the Roman Church in Europe a t that time, the best way of ensuring the acc uracy of the work might well have been to attach to the e lements of the Teac hing that were given to the builders s ome a wful penalties that would be e nacted if they failed to behave - just the kind of penalties that are said to have e xisted in, firstly, operative Freemasonry, and later, speculative Freemasonry (such as is the only known form of it today)? Regardless of these c onjectures however, it is certain – and d emonstrable - that the ground p lan of all of these buildings s till m atches the plan of the Ladder as it has been outlined here. From the masonic pint of view, where than can b e a maximum of thirty-three rather than thirty-two paths or degrees, we ca n discount the apprentices, who, like the potential catechumens, would have had such little preparations was permissible given to them i n the lobby mentioned above, or even outside the building altogether. Of the ac tual craft and higher degrees there would then remain just thirty-two, except that their order would follow the reverse numbering of that used in our specifically kabbalist diagrams. Counting backwards, the masonic e ighteenth, or \"Rose Cross\" degree falls precisely and exactly on our Path Sixteen, where is to be found all the symbolism of the Cross, including the Hebrew letter for a c ross, the Tau.

In one or two English churches this is s till visible from an architectural perspective, and at Durham and York remains so, as the geography of their location makes it physically impossible to extend further eastward without falling d own the hill. Intriguingly, even awesomely, the same is true of the a ncient Temple of Luxor in Egypt, whose date, in the diagram given h ere, is around 1600 b.c.e ., or sixteen hundred years before the Christian Church h ad even b een conceived, but later to be born out of the Israelite religion attributed to Moses, the lawgiver.
