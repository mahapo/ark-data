[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"JEWISH MYSTICS: USING LANGUAGE, TRANSCENDING LANGUAGE, BECOMING LANGUAGE by Rachel Evelyne Barenblat This is an extract from Rachel's Thesis, submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Religion at WILLIAMS COLLEGE, Williamstown, Massachusetts, Apr il 24, 1996 Creation through Letters in the Sefer Yetzirah The Sefer Yetzirah, writes Aryeh Kaplan, is conside red to be the oldest of all Kabbalistic texts. Elio t Wolfson corroborates this claim, calling the Sefer Yetzirah \"one of the most ancient books of Jewish esoterici sm,\" [1] and cites sources dating the Sefer Yetzirah back to the third century C.E. The text itself is quoted as ea rly as the sixth century C.E.; references to the work appear in the first century, and traditions regarding its use att est to its existence in Biblical times. [2] The book is attributed to the Patriarch Abraham. U nfortunately, the origins of the Sefer Yetzirah are no longer available to historians, if in fact t hey were ever known; the author, or authors, of thi s text(s) is a mystery. Some modern scholars find it useful to divide Jewis h mystical texts into the subcategories of \"meditat ive\" and \"magical,\" theosophic and theurgic. The Sefer Yetzi rah fits into both of these categories; there are p assages which deal extensively with meditational techniques, as w ell as detailed instructions for tapping into divin e power. In some ways, the Sefer Yetzirah obviates the distinction b etween meditative and magical mysticism, since the meditations described in the text also enable magical acts, and the magical (or practical) passages are also meditative. In his most recent book Kabbalah: New Perspectives, Moshe Idel emphasises the connections between theo sophy and theurgy. Idel writes that an understanding of G od as divided into Infinite Ein-Sof and knowable Se firot enables the contemplations of the mystic to have deep theur gic capability. According to Idel, there are two ma jor trends in Kabbalah: the theosophical-theurgical and the ecsta tic. The first type, writes Idel, \"encompasses two central subjects: theosophy - a theory of the elaborate str ucture of the divine world - and the ritualistic an d experiential way of relating to the divinity in order to induce a st ate of harmony.\" [3] This type of mysticism is highly theocentric. (In contrast, Idel characterises ecstatic Kabbalah as a nthropocentric, regarding the mystical experience o f the individual as the highest good, regardless of its i mpact on the divine.) The Sefer Yetzirah is both a theosophic text and a theurgic text. There is strong disagreement on the part of scholar s and translators, however, as to the grammar of th e Hebrew in which the Sefer is written. Commentaries which trea t the Sefer Yetzirah as a strictly theoretical and meditative text translate the Hebrew in the third person, i.e. \"He combined,\" \"He created\" etc. According to this read ing of the text, the words refer to God's creation of the universe. However, in many cases the grammatical form more cl osely resembles the imperative: the author is telling the reader to \"combine\" and \"form\" Hebrew letters in a mirroring of the initial Creation. [4] When translated in this fashion, the Sefer Yetzira h becomes an instruction manual for a very specific type of meditation. The implications of th is translation are enormous: that by combining Hebr ew letters in a very specific and extremely demanding manner, we ca n master techniques of telepathy and telekinesis, a s well as taking part in acts of creation, creating living be ings, and reaching unity with the Divine. Through m anipulation of language, we can gain access to the divine Language which is the stuff of creation; through manipulati on of language, we can reach God. This is the doorway to mystical union that the Sefer Yetzirah provides. The title of the Sefer Yetzirah is also significant . Sefer, simply means book. However, the word Yetzi rah, has two different connotations. The root of Yetzirah is 'ye tzer', which means \"make\" or \"do,\" often translated as \"create.\" However, yetzer also appears in the phrases 'yetzer ha-ra' and 'yetzer ha-tov', which are usually tran slated as the evil and good impulses, drives, or urges. While the evil urge is considered to be the root of evil behaviou r, it is also"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"considered to be necessary; without the tension bet ween good and evil, good would have no meaning. Jud aism holds that, without the evil urge, creation and change wo uld not be possible. There exists a rabbinic midras h in which the evil urge is imprisoned by a group of Talmudic rabb is. They are told by a prophet that if they destroy the evil urge, the world will end. They imprison the urge for thre e days, at the end of which time no newly-laid eggs can be found in all of Israel. [5] Clearly, no creation and no change can take place w ithout the existence of both the good and the evil urge. And so, Sefer Yetzirah means \"the Book o f Creation\" - but it refers to a type of creation t hat is involved with the urge. When the title is considered in this light, it is hardly surprising that the meditation s found in the Sefer Yetzirah have theurgic repercussions. Creation is assumed from the beginning of the Sefer Yetzirah to be a linguistic act, an act of separat ion. That creation is linguistic can be observed in chapter o ne of Genesis: God has only to speak and creation t akes place. Genesis also shows that creation is an act of separ ation: God created by separating light from darknes s, earth from sea. However, there are layers of Torah beyond the purely narrative, and the Sefer Yetzirah deals with a deeper level of what it means that creation is linguistic. Creat ion took place when God made boundaries, distinctio ns, within God's-self; boundaries between that-which-is-God an d that-which-is-creation. These divine boundaries e nabled the transition from One into many, and they mirror the divine contraction which preceded creation. This Di vine self- limitation is called tsimtsum. The term tsimtsum in the Zohar designates \"God's initial creative act, an act which of necessity occurs within God... It is this first act of creation which allows the Name, and with it the finite world, to emerge from out of the infinity of the Transcendent Creator.\" [6] The act of tsimtsum was a self-contraction within God, the primal act before any divine emanation. [7] God withdrew into God's-self, enabling the existen ce of something limited, a finite and temporal space whic h was not-God. In this finite space, according to t he Kabbalists, God created the universe. With the appearance of fi nitude to stand in contrast to the Infinite, the su bject-object distinction came into play, and the Creator-Created relation became possible. The first lines of the Sefer Yetzirah speak of how God created the universe with letters and with text . With 32 mystical paths of Wisdom engraved Yah...the living God... Whose name is Holy... ...And He created His Universe with three books (Sepharim) , with text (Sefer) with number (Sephar) and with communication (Sippur) . [8] The \"32 paths\" are the twenty-two characters of the Hebrew alphabet, plus the ten Sefirot. (Another interpretation is that the 32 paths are the twenty-two characters of the Hebrew alphabet, plus the numbers one through t en, which in Hebrew are represented by the first ten letters of the alphabet.) The Sefer Yetzirah states clearly that God created the universe with Hebrew letters: these first lines begin to set up the complicated relation of langua ge to reality. On one level, divine Language is ultimate reality. Cre ation takes place through Hebrew letters. However, language will also come to represent the differences and distinct ions which stand in opposition to divine Unity. On this second level, the duality of language masks the Oneness of ultimate reality. Letters and numbers are the basis of the most essen tial elements of creation, quality and quantity. Th e qualities of a thing can be expressed by words formed out of lette rs; quantities can be expressed in numbers as well as words. However, without plurality , letters and numbers ca nnot exist. The Creator is absolutely unitary; thus , plurality came into existence with creation. Creation was inherent ly a pluralising act; letters and numbers came into being when the Divine established a separation within God's Infini te Self, between Creator and the Created Universe. The first elements of plurality in creation involved the ten Sefirot, God's quasi-attributes or aspects. The Sef irot therefore defined numbers and the concept of quantity in gene ral. [9] According to the Kabbalists, these thirty-two paths are alluded to in the Torah by the thirty-two time s that a specific name of God, 'Elohim', appears in the account of cr eation in the first chapter of Genesis. The name 'E lohim' is a plural word; it therefore represents the manifestat ion of difference. [10] Each of the thirty-two paths, therefore, served to further delineate creation. In other words, lang uage - as manifest in the thirty-two paths used by God to create - is equivalent with delineation and distinction. The letters are referred to as thirty-two \"Mystical Paths.\" The Hebrew word for \"paths\" used in this p assage is an unusual one: instead of the ordinary 'derekh', mean ing \"road\" or \"way,\" the Sefer Yetzirah contains th e word 'nativ', meaning \"path.\" Kaplan's commentary indicates that this was a conscious and intentional choice of word ing. \"A"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Derekh is a public road, a route used by all people . A Nativ, on the other hand, is a personal route, a path blazed by the individual for his personal use. It is a hidden path, without markers or signposts, which one must discover on his own, and tread by means of his own devices.\" [11] The thirty-two paths are private paths, which must be created anew by each individual. The thirty-two mystical paths are also paths of \"Wi sdom.\" The Hebrew word used for Wisdom is 'Chokhmah ', one of the ten Sefirot. Kaplan writes that, for the mys tics who used the Sefer Yetzirah (and, later, for the Lurianic Kabbalists) , Chokhmah (Wisdom) is understood as pure, undifferentiated Mind. [12] Wisdom is thought which has not yet been broken up into parts or differentiated in any way. Wisdom is \"the level above all divisio n, where everything is a simple unity.\" [13] Wisdom is, in short, non-linguistic \"thought.\" Kaplan's commentary indicates that, within the para digm of the Sefer Yetzirah, the antithesis of Wisdo m is Understanding. The Hebrew word for Understanding is 'Binah' (interestingly enough, also one of the ten Sefirot) which is related to 'Beyn', meaning \"between.\" At t he level of Understanding, ideas exist separately. Understanding is the level where division and difference exist; U nderstanding enables and necessitates the subject/o bject distinction. Understanding is inherently linguistic . Within this perspective, language acts to plurali se and differentiate, thereby hiding the Oneness of divine Wisdom. Another interpretation of the importance of Chokhma h, put forth by Leonard Glotzer, is the idea that K eter, the \"first\" or \"top\" Sefirah, is associated with Ayin (nonbeing) , while Chokhmah (the \"second\" Sefirah) is associated with Yesh (physicality or being) . \"God created the world 'Yesh miAyin' - being from nonbeing. Therefore, creation is said to have begun with the Sefirah of Chokhmah, (Wisdom) , the beginning of being.\" [14] Glotzer is careful to remind the reader that \"nonbeing\" in this sense doe s not refer to actual nothingness; Keter is called Ayin because of its incomprehensible nature, and not because of its lack of reality. In his commentary on the Sefer Bahir, or Book of Il lumination (attributed to Rabbi Nehunia ben HaKana, and thought to have been written in the first century C .E.) , Kaplan writes of the Hebrew word for Wisdom, 'Cho khmah', that: ...[Wisdom] has the same letters as 'Ko'ach Mah', the 'power' or 'potential' of What. (Zohar 3:28a, 235b) Alternatively, Ko'ach Mah means 'a certain potential.' In the first sense, it is the power to question, to go beyond what is grasped with Understanding. In the alternate sense, it is an undefined potential, a potential that cannot be grasped with Understanding, which is a lower level, but which must be experienced in its own right. As such, it is man's power to experience, since Wisdom is built out of experience. When one travels on the Paths of Wisdom, one begins with the Heart, which is Understanding. But then, one goes beyond this, to the Experience of Wisdom, which cannot be understood. [15] From Understanding one must proceed to Wisdom, whic h is a higher level than Understanding, and which i s equated with one's potential to go beyond. Wisdom i s the potential of What-ness, the potential of Bein g. The experience of divine Wisdom is beyond understanding : such an experience is mystical union. The divine Name associated with Understanding is 'E lohim'. Elohim represents difference and distinctio n, which necessarily only exist on the linguistic level of U nderstanding. Wisdom, by contrast, is a single undi fferentiated mind - the \"mind,\" if you will, of God - and is onl y divided into thirty-two different paths by the me diation of Understanding, or language. The initial act of crea tion was an act of differentiation: the separation between the infinity of the 'Ein Sof' and the finite created un iverse came into existence simultaneously with the subject/object distinction and with language. The second half of the verse speaks of the \"three b ooks\" with which God created the universe. The \"thr ee books\" to which the verse refers are 'Sefer', translated as \" book\" or as \"text;\"; 'Sefar', translated as \"number ;\" [16] and 'Sippur', translated as \"communication\" or, literally, \"telli ng.\" These three divisions represent quality, quant ity, and communication. They are letters, numbers, and the m anner in which they are used. [17] These three books also correspond directly to the three divisions of creat ion defined by Sefer Yetzirah, namely, Universe, Ye ar, and Soul. (In modern terms, these could be alternately define d as Space, Time and Spirit.) These three aspects are most perceivable in the letters of the alphabet. Letters can be interpreted in three ways: they have a phys ical form, as they"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"are written; this is the aspect of text. Hebrew let ters are also numbers; each one has a numerical val ue, and this is the aspect of number. Finally, there is the sound of th e letter, which corresponds to communication. These three aspects define the word 'Sefirah'. \"Sef irah\" shares a root with \"Sefer,\" or book; like a b ook, the Sefirot can record information, and some scholars consider the Sefirot to be memory banks for the Eternal. The etymology reveals a deep-rooted connection between the two co ncepts of Sefirah and Sefer. The Sefirot, which can be understood as divine emanation, funnelled through s pecific characteristics or attributes, are analogou s to books. Humanity can strive towards the divine, and hope to gain access to God, through written Hebrew texts (i.e. Torah) and through contemplation of the Sefirot; therefore the Sefirot and [Hebrew] books are analogous. The word \"Sefirah\" also shares a root with \"Sefar,\" or number; it is the Sefirot that introduce an ele ment of number and plurality into existence. \"Sefirah\" also shares a root with \"sippur,\" or communication; the Sefiro t are the means by which the Divine communicates with Creation. The y are also, according to the Sefer Yetzirah, the me ans by which we can communicate with God. It is only throu gh the mediation of the Sefirot that we can begin t o grasp the Ein-Sof, the Infinite Divine. While the Sefirot are knowable and the Ein-Sof is b eyond human understanding, the dualism between know able Sefirot and unknowable Ein-Sof is not a dualism of opposition. These two ways of conceptualising God, the division within God between knowable and unknowable, reflect the dualism of concealed versus revealed. The two \"parts\" are not opposed to one another; they do not cancel each other out. One analogy (found in the Zohar) is that of a lamp and the rays of light which emanate from it. When o ne approaches the lamp to examine the rays of light , one discovers that in truth only the lamp exists as a t angible thing. God can be understood in much the sa me way: the Sefirot have no ontological reality. From the point of view of the divine essence, only the unique unity of En-Sof exists, and the difference between the hidden, infinite Emanator and the revealed, limited, emanated beings...is nothing but a reflection of the divine in the mirror of created things, which, because of their limited nature and their lack of unity, are not sufficiently able to grasp absolute unity and infinity. [18] The dualism within God between Ein-Sof and Sefirot is a reflection of the inherent limitations of the (linguistic) human mind and powers of perception, not a reflecti on of an actual division within the Divine. The three \"books,\" or aspects, to which the Sefer Y etzirah refers are not merely conceptual; they have deep practical applications. They are the key to the methods of th e Sefer Yetzirah. If one wants to influence or affe ct anything in the physical universe (space) , she must make use of the physical shape of the le tters (perhaps through visualisation or envisioning letter combinations) . If one wants to affect time, she must use the num erical values of the letters. And if one wants to influence the spiritual realm, she must make use of the sounds of the letters, or of t heir spoken names. The second verse of chapter 1 is only five lines lo ng, and expresses the structure of the letters and of the Sefirot. Ten Sefirot of Nothingness And 22 Foundation Letters: Three Mothers, Seven Doubles, And twelve Elementals. The Sefer Yetzirah is now defining the thirty-two p aths as twenty-two letters and ten Sefirot. Accordi ng to some Kabbalists, the ten Sefirot also parallel the ten H ebrew vowels. Together with the twenty-two letters, they comprise the totality of the Hebrew language. [19] The Sefirot are described as being \"of Nothingness .\" The Hebrew phrase used in this line, 'b'li-mah' can be translated eit her as \"nothingness\" or \"ineffable;\" both interpret ations lead one to the same conclusion, namely that the Sefirot are ul timately ineffable and incomprehensible, because th ey are part of God. Just as some scholars refer to the Sefirah of Keter as Ayin, nothingness, to indicate its ineffab ility, all ten Sefirot are now referred to as \"of nothingness.\" Th e Sefirot are in this way distinguished from letter s. Letters exist"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"both as components of communication and as powerful aspects of divine emanation; the Sefirot are inexp ressible by their very nature. The letters of the alphabet are called \"Foundation letters\" because it is these letters which are the foundation for the universe. In chapter 1, verse 1 of the Sefer Yetzir ah we read that God created the universe with text, number, and communication; these three aspects of language exis t through the Hebrew letters, which enable text, nu mber, and communication. Glotzer writes that \"[i]t has been s aid that the letters compose the body of the Sefiro t, the vessels. Their soul is the inner light that flows through th em.\" [20] In this interpretation, the Hebrew letters themsel ves compose the \"body\" of the Sefirot, the structure th rough which divine emanation flows. Regardless of whether Hebrew letters are conceptual ised as the structure through which divine emanatio n flows, or as the actual divine emanation itself, it is clear that these letters serve as powerful divine tools. Hebrew letters, conceptualised as divine emanation, are part of God ; at the same time, being emanation, they are also partially not- God, or at least they are not the actual Ein-Sof it self. This understanding of the power of letters is corro borated by the writings of Shabbatai Donnolo, a med ieval commentator upon the Sefer Yetzirah. In his comment ary, the Sefer Hakhmonah, Donnolo wrote: ...[T]wo thousand years before the creation of the world the Holy One, blessed be He, played around with the twenty-two letters of the Torah and He combined and rotated them and made from all of them one word. He rotated [the word] frontwards and backwards through all the twenty-two letters... All this the Holy One, blessed be He, for He wanted to create the world by means of His word and the epithet of the great name. [21] For Donnolo, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet (which also comprise the Torah) are identical with the word formed on the basis of those letters, as well as wi th the divine name of God. Eliot Wolfson, a modern commentator, writes of Donnolo that \"The specific connection wit h the logos is also brought out in another passage that describes God as... [containing everything with his Word.] Th e linguistic process is thus the first act of creat ion.\" [22] The word of God (comprised of the twenty-two foundation letters) is identical with God's creative power. It was thr ough the letters of the alphabet that the universe was creat ed; it is through these same letters that the unive rse is sustained. It follows that if one knows how to manipulate these l etters correctly, one can also manipulate the most elemental forces of creation. The letters are divided into three categories. The twelve Elementals are the twelve letters of the Heb rew alphabet with only one sound. The seven Doubles are the seve n letters in Hebrew which have two sounds: for exam ple, Peh, which has both a \"p\" sound and an \"f\" sound; or Bet h, which sounds both like the English \"b\" and the E nglish \"v.\" The three Mothers are by far the most complicated c ategory of letters described in the Sefer Yetzirah. The three Mothers are 'Aleph', 'Mem', and 'Shin'. Kaplan expl ains that these letters are called the three Mother s because they span the entire alphabet, and thus encompass the po tential of all twenty-two letters. Aleph is the fir st letter of the alphabet; Mem is the middle; and Shin is the second -to-last (the last letter, Tav, is one of the Doubles.) Since these letters contain between themselves the potential of the entire alphabet, it is as though they give ris e to that potential, or give birth to it; thus the epithet of \"Mothers.\" The three Mothers will be discussed at great lengt h in chapters two and three of the Sefer Yetzirah. It is in Chapter 1, verse 4, that the Sefer Yetzira h begins to provide instructions for the process of reaching the plane of undifferentiated Mind, and attaining Wisdom (in other words, reaching the level of the Ein-Sof, and becoming a part of the Divine: mystical union.) These instructions detail the methods by which an adept can use language to transcend language. In the fourth verse of Chapter 1, the reader reaches the couplet \"Understand with Wisdom/ Be Wise with Understanding.\" The paradox in this set o f phrases is the key to a technique for transformin g consciousness. Understanding, as discussed before, requires verbal thought. Wisdom, by contrast, is no nverbal and un delineated. Wisdom is pure consciousness. Attain ing pure consciousness (what Kaplan calls Chokhmah consciousness) is very difficult; it is in an attempt to reach Ch okhmah consciousness that meditative techniques (such as mantras or contemplation) are used. The instructions \"Understand with Wisdom , be wise with Understanding,\" involve a deliberate oscillation be tween verbal Binah consciousness and nonverbal Chok hmah consciousness. This ability is vital if one wishes to grasp the Sefirot. The Sefirot are non linguisti c and ineffable;"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"they cannot be understood verbally. They must be re ached by \"paths of Wisdom,\" i.e. through the paths of nonverbal Chokhmah consciousness. [23] The second chapter of the Sefer Yetzirah begins wit h a further description of the three Mothers. The Three Mothers are Aleph Mem Shin Their foundation is a pan of merit a pan of liability and the tongue of decree deciding between them. The three Mothers are reintroduced here in detail. According to Kaplan, the three Mothers are signific ant because they serve as an introduction to the letter-oriente d meditative techniques which occupy an increasingl y central role as the Sefer Yetzirah continues. They also define t he thesis-antithesis-synthesis structure which is c entral to Kaplan's understanding of the Sefer Yetzirah. For Kaplan, on e of the main purposes of the Sefer Yetzirah is to instruct the adept in methods of oscillating between opposing st ates of consciousness; the three Mothers represent the combination of opposites and the balance between th em, which parallels Kaplan's understanding of the n eed to oscillate between opposite states of consciousness in order to find the balance between them which ena bles mystical union. Mystical union is reached by going outside o f the dialectic of linguistic-non linguistic, Binah -Chokhmah; mystical union, in the Sefer Yetzirah, is clearly o utside of dichotomy. The three Mothers represent the three columns into which the Sefirot are separated in the traditional diagram of the Sefirotic structure or Sefirotic tree. [24] The right-hand column, headed by Chokhmah, is repr esented by Mem. The left-hand column, headed by Binah, is represented b y Shin. The middle column, headed by Keter, is repr esented by Aleph. [Meaning \"Crown,\" Keter represents the under standing of God as Creator and Primal Cause. Keter is the Sefirah which is closest to the Ein-Sof, although t he Kabbalists were careful to link this particular interpretation of Keter with the simultaneous understanding that no S efirah is \"closer\" to the Infinite than any other, not only because distance is irrelevant to the Divine, but also beca use any attempt to use the finite constructions of language to label \"aspects\" of God is inherently fallible. ] The lines regarding the pans of merit and liability and the tongue of decree have two interpretations. The Hebrew word in the verse is 'Kaf', which can denote the pa n of a scale as well as the palm of a hand. Likewis e, the word 'Lashon' can be translated either as the tongue or pointer of a scale, or as the tongue which is in th e mouth. One interpretation, therefore, is that Mem and Shin for m the two pans of a scale, two opposite qualities, and Aleph serves as the pointer which holds them in balance. The sec ond interpretation is that Mem and Shin represent t he two hands, and Aleph is the tongue which serves as the \"covena nt between them.\" [25] The lines which follow this explanation of the thre e Mothers deal with the sounds made by the three le tters. Three Mothers, Aleph Mem Shin Mem hums, Shin hisses, and Aleph is the Breath of air deciding between them. These lines indicate that the sounds of these lette rs can be applied practically. Kaplan's interpretat ion holds that the humming sound associated with Mem is a calm and flo wing sound, associated therefore with water and wit h Chokhmah consciousness. If one wants to attain Chok hmah consciousness, one repeats the sound in the ma nner prescribed by the text. The letter Shin, conversely , has a hissing \"s\" sound, a sound which is associa ted with fire and with Binah consciousness. Kaplan's interpretation i s grounded in the interpretation of the Vilna Gaon: Mem is from the lips and does not involve movement of the tongue and the voice, and so its pronunciation is with particular ease, without sound. Similarly, the attribute of kindness tolerates all, and remains silent, and so is water that rests in its place. The Shin is from the tongue in the teeth, and it whistles more than the other letters, and so does the sound and so does the attribute of Strict Law, which screams, and so the fire that does not rest a minute and burns everything. Aleph"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"is air and wind, when the throat is open with wind alone, without the tongue, and this is related to the wind and also to the attribute of Rachamim (Mercy) . [26] Mem is associated with water and with tranquility; Shin is associated with Judgement and with fire; Al eph is associated with air and with divine mercy. These co nnections are illustrated by the actual sounds of t he letters when spoken; the aspect of sound, pronunciation of lette rs, reflects the deeper significance of the letters , and points one toward understanding of the particular divine poten cies of these letters. Kaplan writes that the two sounds, M and Sh, can be used as a device for oscillating between Chokhmah and Binah consciousness. Pronouncing the Shin invokes Binah c onsciousness; pronouncing the Mem shifts the adept to a state of Chokhmah consciousness. It is noteworthy that th ese two letters are dominant in the word 'Chashmal' , which was considered by the Kabbalists to be the interface be tween the physical and the spiritual. One interpret ation of Ezekiel's writings about his mystical vision holds that it was only after he visualised the Chashmal i n the center of the fire that he was able to enter into the state o f prophecy. [27] The word Chashmal comes, according to the Talmud, from two words: Chash, meaning \"silence,\" and Mal, meaning \"speech.\" Chashmal can therefore be transla ted as \"speaking silence,\" the double sensation of existin g simultaneously in verbal Binah consciousness and non-linguistic Chokhmah consciousness. Since Mem and Shin are the dominant consonants in t he word Chashmal, the word can be used as a mantra for inducing a state of oscillation between the two typ es of consciousness, between the mundane world and the limitless understanding of the Divine. The two letters Shin a nd Mem also spell out the word 'Shem', meaning \"Nam e.\" It is through the names of things, and particularly throu gh the Divine Names, that one can make the transiti on between Chokhmah and Binah consciousness. It is important to note the importance of oscillati ng between two radically opposed states of consciou sness in order to attain mystical union. This interpretation of th e Sefer Yetzirah leads directly to an understanding of mystical union as flux between binary opposites; phrased ano ther way, this interpretation leads to an understan ding of mystical union as existing outside of binary opposi tions. The techniques outlined in the Sefer Yetzira h for oscillating between opposing states of linguistic and non lingu istic consciousness provide the mystic with a way t o escape the dichotomies of language/nonlanguage, and finitude/i nfinity. When the mystic succeeds in stepping outsi de of these boundaries separating human from divine, she attain s mystical union. Once an initiate has mastered the simpler technique s for combining letters and vowels, she is ready to move on to the technique of the 231 Gates, a concept which ari ses in the Sefer Yetzirah in chapter 2, verse 4. Twenty-two Foundation Letters: He placed them in a circle like a wall with 231 Gates. The Circle oscillates back and forth. If the twenty-two letters are placed in a circle an d lines are drawn between each of them in every pos sible combination, 231 lines will be drawn. These lines a re the 231 Gates. Because of the grammatical ambiguity of the origina l Hebrew, these lines are particularly interesting. When translated in the imperative, the verse reads: \"Pla ce them in a circle, like a wall with 231 gates.\" W ithin this understanding of the text, the initiate is commande d to imagine the letters engraved into the ground, and then to stand them up in her mind, making a wall around her . She then visualises the lines between the letters weaving a ceiling over her head. Once she has completed the v isualisation exercise, she can make use of letter c ombinations; the letter combinations, or connections between the letters, are the 231 Gates. The initiate should ch ant, or visualise, moving around the circle of letters in a specific o rder: combining Aleph with Bet, Aleph with Gimel, a nd so on, if she wants to create; combining the letters in the o pposite order if she wants to destroy. When read in the imperative, this verse commands the mystic to use the power of Hebrew letters to create life. The Divine Name, according to the Sefer Yetzirah, c ontains within it the structure of the world. Once again, the linguistic structure of experience manifests itself as a theme. In Chapter 2, verse 5, the author of t he Sefer Yetzirah writes \"It comes out that all that is formed/ and a ll that is spoken/ emanates from one Name.\" This Na me is the Tetragrammaton, 'YHVH', and the Sefer Yetzirah call s for every letter to be permuted with the Tetragra mmaton using all five vowels. For each letter, the initiat e must go through the entire sequence of 231 Gates. Each letter must be pronounced with the five primary vowels and the four letters of the Tetragrammaton. The Sefer Yetzirah provides a way for the mystic to strive towards the Divine through the manipulation of Hebrew letters. Despite the fact that letters are the prim ary tool used to strive towards God, the mystic som ehow enters into a"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"nonverbal state of consciousness, in which letters lose their ordinary meaning. In this state of mysti cal consciousness, the raw power of the letters is rele ased, and the mystic gains access to what is \"reall y real\" within the letters, which is their reality as divine emanation . If simple Hebrew letters, by themselves, come dir ectly from the divine, then the Divine Names should have even more power, because they are combinations of letters (powerful tools to begin with) that describe or represent the essence of the Divi ne. However, the Sefer Yetzirah only hints at the potential contained within the Divine Name.
