[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Original Cabala, the Cabala of Eight Elements, the Sufi Cabala One of the best known metaphysical systems that pur ports to give a comprehensive explanation of realit y, including its origin and man's place in it, is the Cabala, wh ich is a large body of teaching - more diverse than most of its contemporary students probably realize - that is al most without exception identified as of Jewish orig in, although even within that assumption opinions differ as to w hether it dates from the time of Moses, or from eve n before that, or, rather, from medieval Europe. In Origins of the Kabbalah , Gershom Scholem describes the question of the Cab ala's origin and the initial phases of its development as second only to the destruction o f the Second Temple in the sense of being problemat ic within the context of the history of Judaism. By no means, he asserts, have the source materials received adequat e attention, and he indicates that a reason for that is that the y are all but bereft of material that can be though t of as historical in the sense of shedding any light on those origins or their circumstances. The symbol with which the Cabala is most widely ass ociated is the one sometimes called the Tree of Lif e, which consists of ten words, representing powers, essence s, archetypes, or aspects of divinity called sefiroth , linked diagrammatically by straight lines. According to so me interpretations, they are to be seen as simultan eous emanations of the infinite, and in others as succes sive and interdependent ones. Indeed, according to an old edition of The Jewish Encyclopedia (Ktav Publishing House, New York; no date; Preface dated 1901), the original Cabala did not even have ten sefiroth : it had eight, and came from a Muslim group known as 'The Faithful Brothers of Basra'. The 'Faithful Brothers of Basra' were the Ikhwan as Safa , the 'Sincere Brethren', a group of Ismaili (a Shi ah subgroup) Muslims whose great tenth century AD work was their Rasa'il ( Letters ), an encyclopedic undertaking that attempted to make available the knowledge of the ti me, including what we would call esoteric or metaph ysical knowledge. They considered themselves heirs to the most ancient wisdom of Pythagoras and Hermes, which the Sufis also say is identical with their tradition. The same Jewish Encyclopedia tells us further that 'Eleazar of Worms' statement that a Babylonian scholar, Aaron B. Samuel by name, brought the mystic doctrine from Babylonia to Italy about the middle of the ninth c entury, has been found to be actually true... The fact is that when Jewish mystic lore came in contact with Arabic -Jewish philosophy, it appropriated those elements that app ealed to it; this being especially the case with Ga birol's philosophy on account of its mystical character... 'The following doctrines of Arab philosophy especia lly influenced and modified Jewish mysticism, on ac count of the close relationship between the two. The \"Faithf ul Brothers of Basra\", as well as the Neoplatonic A ristotelians of the ninth century, have left their marks on the Cab ala. The brotherhood taught, similarly to early Gno sticism, that God, the highest Being, exalted above all differenc es and contrasts, also surpassed everything corpore al and spiritual; hence, the world could only be explained by means of emanations. 1. the creating spirit (no us); 2. the directing spirit, or the world-soul; 3. primal matt er; 4. active nature, a power proceeding from the w orld-soul; 5. the abstract body, also called secondary matter; 6. the world of the spheres; 7. the elements of the sublu nary world; and 8. the world of minerals, plants and animals compos ed of these elements. These eight form, together wi th God, the absolute One, who is in and with everything, the sc ale of the nine primal substances, corresponding to the nine primary numbers and the nine spheres. These nine nu mbers of the \"Faithful Brethren\"... have been chang ed by a Jewish philosopher in the middle of the eleventh ce ntury into ten, by counting the four elements not a s a unit, but as two.' Another source, a little studied historical occult one, discusses the three upper sefiroth as unequivocal disinformation. What that may mean in the context o f the present study should become evident. It also maintains that the real Cabala originated in Babylonia, and i s currently the property of some of the Sufis of Pe rsia. 'The Cabala, however,' The Jewish Encyclopedia continues, 'is not a genuine product of the Proven cal Jews; for just those circles in which it is found were averse to t he study of philosophy. The essential portions of t he Cabala must, on the contrary, have been carried to Provence from Babylon; being known only to a small circle until Aristotelianism began to prevail, when adherents of the speculative Cabala were forced to make their d octrine public.' One of the meanings of the Arabic word qabala is 'to receive'. Some of the metaphorical language in which Cabalists over the centuries have struggled to desc ribe their understanding of the working of the sefiroth involves references to them as 'vessels' into which, and fro m which, one to another, a sublime reality or power is 'poured'"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"from its celestial origin, and that each sefirah manifests in a different way in order to produce w hat we experience as the universe, including ourselves. In Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism , Scholem presents the familiar idea of the Tree of Life as one with many sefirothic branches but a single, unknowable root. The sap of the root, the concealed root of the root, and the transcendent reality beyo nd the sefiroth and the tree itself is the En-Sof (or Ain Sof or Ein Sof ), usually translated as the 'absolutely infinite'. The Tree of Life is the cosmic skeleton, and every thing, even the most trivial, that exists only does so through the potentiality bestowed on it by, and active through it from, the sefiroth . ... In most traditions of consciousness development, th ere is none without some form of watchfulness. With in historic Jewish mysticism - both, apparently, apart from the tradition of the Cabala and, at times and in some ways, confluent with it - are the teachings of the merkabah ('chariot') mystics. They were and are so called, Scholem says in Major Trends , because they took as their point of departure (as it were) the first chapter of the book of Ezekiel, wherein the prophet has his vision of God's throne - which, in motion, becomes a chariot. It was, he says, nothing less than the earliest form of Jewish mysticism. Even with such a rudimentary sketch of the Cabalist ic sefiroth as we have given, their essential similarities wit h the 'throne-world', in the sense that they are both way s of seeing the divine in the profane, or the divin e behind the profane, are evident; and in fact, in discussing (i n Origins of the Kabbalah ) the seven lower sefiroth in the context of one of the earliest known Cabalistic works, a book called Bahir , Scholem writes that a variety of symbolisms directly taken from the works of the merkabah mystics were, at that seminal stage, used to repre sent the seven lower sefiroth , thus infusing the Cabalistic legacy for generatio ns to come with those otherwise, strictly speaking, non- Cabalistic elements. Jewish mystical authors at various times spoke of a n 'ascent to the merkabah ', in the sense that it is 'above' man's ordinary life, and also of a 'descent' to its visio n, because it is also within his own being. It was a complex and hazardous journey of many stages, and preparation f or it involved austerities, repetitions and physica l postures, especially the head between the knees. There is, thus, a connection between the Cabala and the ideas of control, of discipline, of temperance . Indeed, an idea that runs throughout Cabalistic literature is that the sefirothic Tree of Life is also a representation of man, and that man is the microcosm of the universe, which is the Body of God. By exercising watchfulness over h imself - or at least, with that as a first step - man can attai n the vision of the whole beyond himself. The simil arity with Sufi teaching about the 'complete' or 'perfect' man is o bvious. Markabat is Arabic for a 'vehicle, carriage, beast for ridin g', from the verb rakaba , 'to ride, drive, sail, make use of any vehicle'. The verb raqaba , spelled and sounding almost exactly the same, mea ns 'to observe attentively, to be on the watch for, watch, expect, guard'. ... On another level, the chariot itself has been, as w e saw when discussing the Cabala, a metaphor for a metaphysical reality, regardless of whether it is accurate to se e it and the usage just given as forming a continuu m. The association of its status in that regard with what became the d octrine of the sefiroth in Jewish teaching is controversial. But then, as we have also seen, the sefiroth as they became and as they started out are differe nt. The earliest Jewish sources using the term do so in the context of describing t he ecstatic travels of the mystic through seven sta ges, formulated as temples or palaces, on his way to the throne of God. During the course of that journey, he becomes privy to all sorts of revelations that culminate in the vision o f the Creator, including gnosis of the structure of His own person. As far as the dervishes are concerned, according to Brown in The Darvishes, or Oriental Spiritualism , muraqaba is the name they give to the contemplative and prayerf ul state, associated with wakefulness and the preva iling of the powers of the soul over the body while the two are yet united. They have a different name, insila , for the condition where the soul takes leave of the physical frame an d wanders unfettered by space or time. It was when he was in such a state that the Prophet Mohammed went on his night time journey, carried by the angelic horse Buraq . "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"... We considered the possibility that it was originall y intended as some sort of representation of or ref erence to the enneagram and, in considering the Cabala, with its components the sefiroth , we took note of the fact that authoritative sources aver that the form of the Cab ala that we have inherited differs from the origina l in that the original version had eight, not ten, sefiroth . The Tarot and the Cabala are seen to have come from the same sources and to have become publicly known in Europe around the same time. (Cards were popular en ough in Germany in 1329 to be banned by the Church, and the Gringonneur cards of 1392 are clearly Tarot.) The e nneagram is also seen to be from that source. It is thus not unreasonable to seek correlations among them that m ay prove illuminating. The Cabala had eight sefiroth , and one of the 'laws' the enneagram is supposed to express is the 'law of octaves'. The musical scale has seve n notes, eight if you count both 'doh's - which involves or implies t he notion of it as a dynamic and developing thing, just as the enneagram, a circle with nine points, is 'in motion ' and part of its information concerns the relation ship of any living thing, or 'cosmos', with the world outside of it, n othing alive existing in isolation. One may then sp eculate whether a diagrammatic, geometric representation of 'eightnes s' may be said to have some sort of instructive rel ationship with the diagram of the nine points, and whether, and if so how, one may somehow be the 'unfolding' of the other. Gurdjieff (as reported by Ouspensky) famously confi rmed that the enneagram as he had divulged it was i ncomplete and, in particular, that it was not possible, using only the material he had given, to connect it with a comprehensive representation of the law of seven (or law of octav es), and that the means to do so were more complica ted than he had shown. ... Taking into account the ten sefiroth in their traditional arrangement, En Sof , or Ein Sof , the 'absolutely infinite', is sometimes included, usually above Kether , 'crown', as its source and the source of all the sefiroth . Some authors have maintained that the Ein Sof and Kether are distinct, others that they are, at least in so me sense, the same. Likewise, Da'ath , or 'knowledge', is sometimes added - with the wor d, enclosed by a circle or a broken circle to indicate its fluid and ubiquitous nature with respe ct to the sefiroth , in the upper middle among them, between Kether and Tifereth . Leo Schaya, in The Universal Meaning of the Kabbalah , maintains that the positioning thus of Da'ath alludes to God's omniscience and omnipresence, so t hat Da'ath is not itself a sefirah , but rather the knowing presence of the divine in each sefirah . Even so, the idea of God's omniscience itself cam e to be seen by Cabalists as corresponding to the blending of the upper sefiroth Hokmah and Binah , which would be the knowledge that the divine singularity has of the whole of creation, as distinct from its knowledge of itself (the latter of which would be the meaning of Hokmah alone). We need to keep in mind these two facts: that there is, in Cabalistic lore, in addition to the ten sefiroth , an element above and outside them that represents 'the infinit e', and another one within them that has been trans lated as 'knowledge', but an Arabic homonym of which, dhat , means 'essence', which is significant in Sufi tea ching. Regarding the Ein Sof , the 'absolutely infinite', such a formulation is easily comparable in its meaning with the being-beyond-being from which all originates in the Sufi metaphysical scheme we have already looked at ; it also sounds rather like something approximating 'eye of purity' in Arabic, and one may speculate whether, a s we have seen happened so often, a meaning on one level - in this case, that of perception through the part of oneself that can be relatively free from conditioned influences - ha s been lost and its terminology applied to another. ... We should consider further the correspondences betw een the Da'ath of the sefirothic tree, the dhat of the dervishes, and the inner triangle of the enneagram. In Al Khair al Kathir , Shah Waliullah says that each level of creation i s passive in relation to the level that precedes it and from which it is produced, so that the latte r is active in relation to the lower and subsequent level. Further, the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"'substance' and 'secret' of 'a thing' (a thing that is 'passive' in this sense), he says, is to be fou nd in the dimension of it that is present in the precedent, active level that has caused it to come into being. In other words, the reality or essence of a thing is to be understood in those ter ms and in that context, and not, presumably, in ter ms of its existence in the context of all the other ('passive ' in this sense) existents that also have their own respective active causes on another, higher, level of reality. The idea that the essence of a thing is what makes it that thing, without which it would cease to be w hat it is - in the case of something living, presumably, this would co rrespond to, at least where physical existence is c oncerned, death - is potentially instructive when you conside r that, in the enneagram, it is the function of the inner triangle (points 3, 6 and 9) to supply the 'shocks' or consc ious filling-in-the-gaps at what correspond to the intervals that occur, as in the musical scale, in the course of th e circulation of movement around and within the dia gram. It is the filling of these intervals with new energy and impe tus that prevents the natural tendency for the proc ess in question (even where the process is a thing) to tend toward its own opposite: entropy, and also enables the oct ave, whatever it is in the given case, to maintain or regain a conne ction with its origin. With the doing-away of the idea of the octave, with its intervals and their significance, the role of the Da'ath in the sefirothic tree is also susceptible to becoming a basis for a rbitrary theorizing. Is there anything else in Cabalistic lore as we hav e received it that suggests the survival of the ide a of a process, in time, in some sense cyclical, involving eight eleme nts and a hierarchical ontology? The late Gershom Scholem, undoubtedly the best know n scholar of Cabala and Jewish mysticism of our tim e, wrote in his book Origins of the Kabbalah about the first group identifiable as a Cabalistic one to appear in Spain (Gerona, a small town between Barcelona and the Pyrenee moun tains) in the thirteenth century. Their location, h e points out, situated them well for absorbing other esoteric tra ditions being studied by their respective represent atives in the same general area at the time, and that they would have incorporated them into their Cabalism. Teachings pertaining to cosmic cycles from sources in India and among the Arabs are known to have foun d homes in the thinking of medieval Jewish philosophers, bu t one doctrine in particular attained special impor tance in the Gerona school and, thus, for the development of the Cabala. The doctrine in question is that about the shemittoth , or 'world cycles', and it was expressed in an anonymou s work entitled Temunah . The shemittoth teaching held that God's power of creation is not confined to the sefiroth , and also encompasses their manifestation in creat ions that occur in sequence and succession. It is only possib le for all that is hidden within the sefiroth to be completely exteriorized by its doing so through individual cos mic singularities each of which exists and function s in a way appropriate to the particular sefirah being expressed. It is at this point that the dist inction between the upper three and the lower seven sefiroth becomes of practical significance. The upper three , Kether , Hokmah and Binah , are, as it were, in the shemittoth doctrine, inherent and concealed powers constitutin g three aspects of the fundamental informing capacity of the godhead and, unlike the l ower seven, are not visibly (or at least obviously) active in the world, in the sense of being recognizable as stages in cosmic building processes. The other seven sefiroth , on the other hand, were held to directly correlate to the days of creation of the Genesis story; and each, in fact, constitutes a creation that is separate and self contained. Scholem goes on to describe how, in the Gerona scho ol, each of these latter was believed to last 7000 years, or one of God's weeks, with a period of fallowness between them, taking their cue from the Book of Deuteronom y. It thus seems at least possible that the eight sefiroth of the original Cabala of the Ikhwan as Safa and the Sufis consisted of the seven lower sefiroth of the Cabala we know, plus the three upper sefiroth combined into one; if so, it would resonate with the occult source's assertio n that the division of the top sefirah into three was something like a deliberate deception. Moreover, the description o f the first three sefiroth as hidden powers not active in the apparent world as are the other seven obviously clo sely parallels the relationship, and difference, be tween the 'law of three' and the 'law of seven' as Gurdjieff taught t hem. On the other hand, this scheme still does not, on t he face of it, correspond with the 'nine numbers of the \"Faithful Brothers\"', the Ikhwan as Safa - eight plus God, as it were - spoken of by the au thor of the Jewish Encyclopedia article. The sequence of emanations, again, as he and others have transmitted them is as follows: 1. The creati ng spirit. 2. The directing spirit, or world soul. 3. Primal matt er. 4. Active nature. 5. The abstract body, or seco ndary matter. 6. The world of the spheres. 7. The elements of the su blunary world. 8. The world of minerals, plants and animals. The ten sefiroth of the Cabalistic 'tree' are traditionally given, with minor variations in transliteration, as follow s: 1. Kether , 'Crown'. 2. Hokmah , 'Wisdom'. 3. Binah , 'Intelligence'. 4. Hesed , 'Grace' or 'Love'. 5. Din , 'Severe Judgement', or, sometimes, Gevurah , 'Power'. 6. Rahamim , 'Compassion', or, sometimes, Tifereth , 'Beauty'. 7. Netsah , 'Victory'. 8. Hod , 'Majesty' or 'Glory'. 9. Yesod , 'Foundation'. 10. Malkuth , 'Kingdom'. Some of these terms correspond directly with Arabic words that occur frequently in Sufi metaphysical w riting. Hikmat means 'wisdom', especially 'divine wisdom'; din ('deen') means 'judgement, victory', and also 'rel igion, faith';"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"rahim , of course, means 'mercy' or 'compassion'; jabarut means 'power', especially 'spiritual power'; and malakut means 'kingdom', from malik , 'king'. Others, by their sound, correspond direct ly with Arabic words the meaning of which is not, however, the meaning assigned to them in Hebrew in the sefirothic 'tree': but is, on the other hand, the meaning - and sometimes the meaning in an unexpecte d way - of some other term in the same scheme. Assuming that the sequence and terms given as those of the Ikhwan are correct, the first one, the 'creating spirit', corresponds with the Primal Intelligence, the Reali ty of Mohammed, the Exalted Pen. In Arabic one of i ts names is 'aql al kull , the 'intelligence of the universe' or 'world inte lligence'. The name of the first sefirah is Kether , which means 'crown'. Arabic for 'crown' is iklil ('ikleel') - which sounds very much like 'aql al kull , or, as it would be in Persian, 'aql i kull ('aql ee kull'). Drawn from the Pen as was Eve from Adam is the Book , or Slate, the 'world soul', 'alam al arwah , the nafs of the universe, the repository, in a sense, of the divine ideas or forms or archetypes that are the 'basis' of everything existing in our world. In Arabic, bani or baniyan is 'foundation', as in 'foundation of a building': and, of course, that closely resembles Binah in sound, and Yesod in meaning. The Arabic term - or one of them - for 'primal matt er', haba , means 'fine dust suspended in air'. A similar-sou nding word, hubb , means 'love', the same as the sefirah Hesed . Ibn al 'Arabi says that 'active nature', created by the 'alam al arwah , is the third thing produced in sequence from the Primal Intelligence. Arabic for 'nature' is tabiyat ; the particular sense of 'nature' here, though, is 'active', 'setting in motion'. Nashat (the sefirah Netsah ) means, literally, 'drive from place to place', 'l ively, brisk', 'invigorate'. The 'abstract body,' jism , or 'secondary matter', hayula , is 'physical' matter, and the nature of its relat ionship with 'primal matter' is a subject that can be discussed at some length, and has been by historical authors. Another Arabic word that sounds much like haba ('primal matter') i s haybah : 'fear' or 'terror'. It would appear that the dich otomy of the gentle and severe aspects of divinity - jamal , 'beauty', and jalal , 'majesty', for instance - have here been applied, or misapplied, with each being assigned to one of t he two kinds of 'matter'. The gradations of being i n this scheme of the Ikhwan , however, do not represent aspects of divinity, bu t stages of manifestation. Nor do they, as given, h ave intricate and specific interconnections as seen in the sefirothic 'tree'. The intermittent inclusion in the midst of the latter of dhat , 'essence', however, and the interconnections of t he points of the circumference of the enneagram, th e inner triangle of which is supposed to represent th e vital status of the thing or being represented, d oes suggest that the formulators of the sefirothic Cabala were trying to produce something of their o wn by combining elements of the teaching of the Ikhwan and the enneagram of the Sarmoun, and other Sufi do ctrines as well. In the case of 'secondary matter', it has been taken, as it were b y default, to be the 'glorious' or 'majestic' aspec t of divine reality that has been further confused with the 'fear' or ' terror' that it (or something else) might arouse in an individual, which is what haybah means. Similarly, the range of meanings associated with 'm ajesty' probably produced the 'severity' of the 'se vere judgement' that is the meaning of the sefirah Din . 'Sphere', as in 'world of the spheres', the next em anation after 'secondary matter', in Arabic is falak . Falqahat means 'grace' (the meaning of the sefirah Hesed , or perhaps that of Tifereth ) in the sense of 'polite manners, social graces'. Undoubtedly another kind or level of 'grace' altoge ther was intended by Hesed , but the term carried over. Another name for this level of being is 'throne', 'arsh . The elements of the sublunary world: it is these th at are said to have been divided into two by the Ca balists. There are four: heat, cold, moisture and dryness; or, fir e, air, water and earth. Again, the sense of 'heat' and 'cold' has been overlooked, so that hada(t) , 'heat' in the sense of an individual's temperamen t of being inclined to activity or violence, has given us the sefirah Hod . Fatur , 'cold' in the sense of 'lukewarm, indifferent', m ay well have been compounded with furutat , 'sweet' (if, extending the tree analogy, the esse nce, dhat , of the fruit of the tree may be said to be sweet), to produce the name Tifereth . 'Arsh means 'throne', but a closely similar word, arsh , in Arabic means 'creatures', in the sense of 'all creatures'. In its meaning it corresponds with the sefirah Malkuth , 'kingdom', even though in the Ikhwan 's formulation it was meant to comprise 'minerals, plants, and animals', but no t humans. Bain or baun (another possible source for Binah ) means 'interval' or 'interstice', which is of int erest if the enneagram was referred to, because of the intervals in the 'l aw of octaves'. Gevurah , or Geburah , could also come from kabir , as in al insan al kabir , 'the big man' (the macrocosm). Netsah , the sefirah , may mean 'victory', but it also, in addition to nashat , sounds a good deal like nats , 'intelligent, clever' (the meaning of the sefirah Binah ), and also nasut , 'humanity', which, like jabarut , is the name of one of the five broad hierarchical divisions: al hahut (God's essential nature), al lahut (divine creative nature), al jabarut (world beyond form, divine power), al malakut (angelic kingdom) and an nasut (human nature and body).

Strength is further giv en to the notion that the esoteric influences on th e Spanish Gerona school of Cabalists may have included Chinese Taois t material by the obvious similarity of the Tree of Life diagram to the various forms of the 'Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate' ( T'ai Chi T'u ). The Chinese figure has as the source, shown at the top, 'the Ultimateless, yet Supreme Ul timate' and, at the bottom, 'the production and evo lution of all things'. A tenth century example may be found in Da Liu's popular book, T'ai Chi Chu'an and Meditation , and others are in scholarly works on Chinese philosophy . ... In discussing the concept of the commanding self, w e speculated whether much of modern Western culture -- with, for instance, its pervasive narcissism -- in some s ense represents its triumph. In recent years Joe Public, if he has come across t he enneagram at all, is likely to have done so as p art of the incredibly popular 'enneagram of personality types' movement. There are believed to be nine principal types, and the manner of their interaction, and the paths for 'dev elopment', if it can be called that, from one type to another, follow the lines connecting the points on the circumferenc e of the enneagram; which, as in what would appear to be the authentic enneagram teaching, are thought to be in motion. The proliferation of books, seminars, journ als, workshops, websites and whatever about these 'ennea gram personality types' is nothing short of awe-ins piring. Although virtually every book on the 'personalities enneagram' announces that the symbol is thought to have 'originated with the Sufis' and was first made know n in the West by Gurdjieff, they generally neglect to mention that there is no convincing evidence that the use to whi ch they are trying to put it is a correct one, or, indeed, that their approach has anything at all to do with anyone born before Fatty Arbuckle tried The Prison Diet . The fact that there are so many different versions of the scheme would, one hopes, give it away. Every body has his or her own idea about what the 'types' are and what the right arrangement of them is. It cannot be a c ase of multiple levels of interpretation, either, because without c onsistency such a system is meaningless. How - not to put too fine a point on it - is it pos sible to take seriously a book that, when you look at the examples it gives to make a certain 'type' understandable, says , 'Burt Reynolds'? Would that be the Burt Reynolds of Evening Shade, or the Burt Reynolds of Boogie Nights ? Or Duckman ? Personally, I preferred Malone ... Did they have Burt Reynoldses in Sargon's Babylon? How about medieval Bokhara? If it is universally va lid, and by definition it must be, there must be Inuit, Thai an d Australian Aboriginal Burt Reynoldses? The acclaimed French film director Francois Truffau t evidently considered Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) one of the greatest films ever made. What isn't cle ar is whether he meant the version that was release d, that had the happy ending insisted on by Hollywood, or the origi nal, which concluded with the doctor stumbling abou t the busy highway and shouting hysterically and futilely. ... One scholar of these matters describes the Tablets (or Tablet) of Destiny, or, to use the Sumerian wor d for them, the me ('meh' or 'muh'), as a sort of divine template. Ano ther calls them an idea of central importance in Su merian religion, where they were believed to be the proper ty of Enki (the Sumerian name for the Babylonian Ea , the god who warned Utnapishtim, the Sumerian Noah, of the i mpending flood). They were, he says, the orders of heaven and the basis for all aspects of society and religi on. Yet another presents the me as a collection of items fundamental to civilization, thought of (he maintains) by the S umerians themselves as, in some sense (perhaps symb olically), physical objects, but which we would conceive of as abstract ideas, and encompassing everything from t ruth and lies to prostitution, priesthood, peace and instruments of music. Let us consider this startlingly un-primitive conce ption in light of the ideas that we discussed earli er about levels of reality emanating from a sublime source. Looking do wn, as it were, from God's point of view - and as b lasphemous as that might sound, it is only an exercise to try to follow what the great teachers have said about h ow it really is - the First Intelligence was created, the Universal Soul was produced out of that, and the Intelligence then transmitted to the Soul - the Pen wrote on the Tablet - everything that was to be; an d the World Soul made it, and continues to make it, happen. At some point, as Ibn al 'Arabi said in so many words, this means everything we know."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"As we have seen, in Sufi teaching as formulated cla ssically within the Islamic context, God has attrib utes, which manifest as his names ( asma ), and these have some relationship with 'fixed ent ities' ( a'yan ath thabita) , which are 'fixed' in the sense that they are so in knowledge. There is, in fact, the 'alam al jabarut , the 'world of (divine) power', beyond form; and there is the 'alam al mithal or 'alam al khiyal , the 'world of similitudes (or forms)' or 'world o f imagination'. They are 'similitudes' because they a re not the 'real thing': they are the version of th e real thing that we experience. In a sense, of course, the real thing i sn't a thing; which is to say, it is more 'real' th an 'thing'. Jung had his idea of archetypes, but they are not q uite the same. His conception was characterized by his preoccupations as a psychiatrist, studying the indi vidual and 'collective unconscious', where potent i mages and patterns seemed to manifest inexorably in the lives and dreams of troubled people. He has been criticiz ed for overstepping the bounds of his discipline and enter ing the realm of religion, but what most people wou ld mean by 'religion' in this context itself exemplifies an ig norance of the comprehensiveness of the knowledge o f which we are seeking echoes.

The archaism of archaic formulation is an obstacle only to the extent that we are unwilling to trouble ourselves both to overcome our own hidden assumptions of superiori ty and forego the sense of drama that accompanies what we feel mu st be the tragedy of being modern and ignorant, and embrace the tedium of finding the lock, finding the key to the lock, and putting the key in the lock and turning it.

Meanings of the word nuh ('nooh') in Arabic, as 'Noah' is rendered, include 'bewail the dead' (as he must have done) and 'turn to, set oneself to (do something)' (as he also did). From nah we get 'urge to haste, goad on' (and nahih , 'repeat a tone in the chest', reminiscent of the Su fi dhikr ). Niha means 'end, limit, extent', which the Flood certai nly was. Naih is 'derive quiet from': in the original Mesopotami an version, the gods decided to destroy mankind bec ause people were, simply, making too much noise. ('Noise ' here undoubtedly represents the dissonant emanati ons produced en masse by a less-than-top-quality species, the toxic ener getic waste of a creature whose evolution had gone so badly astray as to impinge upon the very ha rmony of the spheres; and the 'sweet savour' of the smoke rising up to, and pleasing, God from the sacrificed animal s that Noah offers after the waters have subsided a nd they are back on dry land, the restoration of those emanatio ns to purity and excellence.) Nauh , with a different h , means 'be firm, courageous', and 'fill without satiating' (as God did to the earth, with rain). 'Flood' is tufan , in the sense of 'deluge', 'continuous rain', and also 'general mort ality', 'far-reaching storm or calamity' and 'great quantity'. Tafanin means 'lies, idle talk; holding back; remaining beh ind' (as most people did). Tafnin , differently spelled, is 'mixture' (recall Shah Waliullah and (in Al Khair al Kathir ) the notion that our world constitutes the mixing- together of aspects of the Divine Names in such a way that ther e is rarely harmony between things in their ideal s tatus, and that what we think of as evil is, in some cases, what ha ppens when Divine Names of conflicting meaning enco unter each other). The word from which markab , 'boat', is derived is rakaba , 'travel on the sea'. As we have seen, raqaba means 'watch, observe attentively'; and baraka , of course, is not only the word for what is tradi tionally thought of as the 'blessing' associated with Sufis that, among other things, protects and preserves, but also means 'rai n continuously'. ... The signs of the zodiac, more often than not, a re, or include, animals. A word for 'heaven' or 'fi rmament' (also 'sign') is sama' ; ism , on the other hand, with the same consonants, is ' name' or 'noun', as in 'Names of God'. (One might also proceed from 'noun' to 'thing' and the ' realities'.) Waliullah elaborates on these as names or attributes of God, and says that they are in permanent rotation, and describes understanding their cyclic movement a nd its meanings in terms of being something highly desirab le. 'Animals' can thus be taken as representing the 're alities', the 'divine ideas' or, if you like, arche types. The word in Arabic, haiwan , means not only 'animal', but 'anything living', a nd even 'life'. It is thus not difficult to see wha t is meant by one of each (gender) being on the boat, or Ark. The world covered in water is, in effect, formless and uncreated: the 'blessed realities' are above it . It is the world above and 'before' our own. The nature of the connection between that world and ours, or at least something of the nature of the c onnection we may, in our current situation, be able to make with it, is suggested by what Noah does with the raven and the dove. The raven is robust and coarse compared with the de licate dove, somewhat like the relationship between left and right brain mentation, logic and intuition. Nothing can be learned about this realm by referring to th e raven: the fact that it doesn't come back is no sure indication eit her that land has appeared, or that it hasn't, beca use it can just keep flying. The dove, representing a refinement of thin king, returns with an olive branch: Arabic for both 'olive' and 'olive oil' is zait : 'oil', of course, is the same as 'essence', and e ven sounds very much like dhat . The refinement to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"vanishing point, as it were, of the dove may repres ent a stage of mystical certainty; from our earthly point of view, perhaps, it can be seen as indicating a successful 'reception' of some sort. (Researchers on intuition, incidentally, hav e discovered that the way to determine whether an intuitive impulse i s genuine is to see whether it repeats.) On the other hand, within the terms of the larger a llegory, it may be that the detection of the presen ce of the olive tree - the source of the branch the dove brings bac k - represents something akin to the Cabalistic En Sof that is both the origin of the sefiroth and the 'sap' that vivifies them: it indicates - o r creates? - the 'dry land' where the 'animals', the archetypes, can then manifest themselves. In the text, the rainbow is supposed to be the sign of God's solemn 'promise' ( wa'd , 'make a promise') that he will 'never' again destroy all living creatures; later, it specifically says, 'with a flood'. Associated me anings for wa'd include 'arrange' or 'appoint a time for', 'threate n, menace', and even 'deadline'. Similar-sounding w ords mean 'kill, destroy', 'multiple, numerous', and 'return' and 'r ecurrence'. (Remember also the ' 'Ad ' people of the Koran .) 'The waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh', reads Chapter 9, Verse 15 of Genesis. 'Water', ma' , sounds almost exactly like ma , 'not', indicating negation, of course; and the pl ural of 'water', miyah , is like mauh , 'to mix' (Shah Waliullah and the 'divine predicates' ag ain?), and also, 'thin, dilute, adulterate; falsify , misrepresent'; and also like maih , 'to strut, swagger, walk with affected dignity'. The double negative, if it can be so construed, is potentially troubling (there won't not be another f lood), and there are evocations of deceit and the s ort of behaviour characteristic of the commanding self, which can ha rdly be said to have become a thing of the past. While the Contemporary English Version has God speaking of the rainbow as being 'in the s ky', the consensus of most other translations is that it should be as it appears in the King James : 'the bow shall be seen in the cloud', and 'the bow shall be in the cloud'. 'Bow' is qus ; ghash means 'corruption, debasement, fraud, deceit', and kais , 'intelligence, subtlety, gracefulness, elegance'. Qiyas is 'measurement, reference, scale, example, analog y, comparison'. The primary word for 'clouds' in Arabic is ghamam , from gham , meaning 'cover, veil, conceal', 'be obscure, incomprehensible', and also 'to fill with sadness, pain or grief'. The notion of 'covering' overlaps with another rang e of words associated with washy , which means 'embellish, ornament with many colours , embroider (a fabric); slander, defame'; and 'faul t, flaw, defect; mark, sign'. 'The rainbow will be the sign of that solemn promise', r eads Chapter 9, Verse 17. On one level, the message would appear to be that p ainful experiences contain something potentially va luable for those intelligent and subtle enough to be able to s ee through superficialities and appearances, perhap s by some kind of analogical approach. Considered from yet another angle, and taking into account the possibility that the object portrayed i n [an artefact in the British Museum, thought to be from northern Syr ia] is indeed a rainbow, it may be that we are mean t to consider the rainbow and the animals, or their meaning, in a closer relationship than is conveyed in the Noah's Ark story as we have it. The rainbow and the animals may simply be a symbolic representation of that cyclic manifes tation of Divine Names already mentioned. Ishtar, in that cas e, would represent the World Soul from which they a ll depart and to which they all return. ... There have always been at least two schools of thou ght regarding the origin of the Cabala, even where it has been assumed to be an undistorted and, as it were, pure product. Modern scholarship, as far as it has gone, has tended in favour of a medieval formulation; but there have al ways been those with a strong commitment to its ext reme antiquity, who have said it antedates all recorded religious manifestations. If the demonstration of i ts derivation from a wisdom tradition that does, in fact, fit that des cription isn't enough for them, perhaps further evi dence of the presence of that knowledge, which is also - as we h ave seen - as modern as we can imagine in that most ubiquitous of holy sources, the Old Testament, will be. There is even a further irony inasmuch as it is one place where we may be able to find hints of how it ems as seemingly disparate as the 'law of seven' and the d ichotomous nature of human consciousness, as well a s other things, may be harmonized. The second Book of Samuel contains a number of stor ies, among them, in the second chapter, stories of the strife between Abner, who had been the general of the now deceased (king) Saul, and who made Saul's son Ishbo sheth king of Israel in Mahanaim, on one side of the Jord an River, and David, king of the tribe of Judah in Hebron, on the other side."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The narrative relates how Abner and Ishbosheth's so ldiers one day just happened to run into Joab with David's soldiers 'at the pool in Gibeon'. They sat down on opposite sides of the pool, and Abner suggested tha t they have their best soldiers engage in combat. Twelve of Ish bosheth's best Benjaminites and twelve of David's p rime crew, it says ( Contemporary English Version ), 'grabbed each other by the hair and stabbed each other in the side with their daggers. They all died right there!... Then everyone s tarted fighting. Both sides fought very hard, but D avid's soldiers defeated Abner and the soldiers of Israel. ' The status of the combatants as 'the best' is a clu e that it is something as relatively elusive as qua lities that are being discussed. The 'law of three' has it that where the re is no third, reconciling or neutralizing force, the first two forces, the positive and negative, though they may meet, ca n produce nothing: just as the twelve warriors on e ach side exactly match, and then perfectly annihilate, each other. (A pool is a stagnant body of accumulated wa ter: Arabic words for it emphasize that aspect, of coming toget her, collection, combination.) The rest then join t he fray, and the victors, David's surviving men, may be said to repr esent the produced-with-difficulty third force. David is not actually present; his forces are, as m entioned, led by Joab, who is 'the son of Zeruiah'. 'Zeruiah's three sons were there,' it continues, 'Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Asahel could run as fast as a deer in an op en field, and he ran straight after Abner, without looking to the ri ght or to the left.' These characteristics of Asahe l reveal him as representing the activity of the left hemisphere of the brain, the analytic function, which knows only its target, its goal to be achieved, and is impatient with anything not devoted to the same purpose. In the context, a s it will be seen, although it says all three sons 'were there', Abishai remains behind: he is thus the passive for ce. Joab represents the reconciling force, and in understanding the int erplay of these things is to be seen the knowledge the story contains. It is said in the lore about the law of seven and t he enneagram that where an 'interval' in the 'octav e' occurs, if the process the octave represents is to proceed with un diminished force or without misdirection, the gap o f the interval must be filled by energy from the source of the pro cess itself or, hypothetically, from some other, co incidental, source. (From a certain point of view, of course, a ll processes and all energies ultimately have the s ame source anyway.) To that extent, then, the resulting third force - that enables the process to get past its st age of self bafflement, the state of mutual thwarting of the op posed 'positive' and 'negative' forces - and the un differentiated origin are one and the same. Perception of differen ce is in the domain of the left brain. We have also touched on the role of the right brain, which is concerned with si multaneity, spatiality, and wholeness, in what has traditionally been called 'mystical' experience, which is general ly taken to mean man's (and woman's) experience of wholes, of comprehensive realities, from which humanity is cus tomarily separated, or at least feels itself to be because of the imbalance that has existed throughout recorded huma n history as a result of the over-emphasis of left brain-type thinking. There is thus no contradiction in saying that Asahe l represents 'both' the activity of the left brain and the active force in the law of three, bearing in mind that in any re al context the definitions of these things are rela tive. So he goes (slipping into the present tense, if we may) running after Abner. If we are taking it that the point of the allegory is to tell us something useful in the cont ext of improving our understanding of these matters , it does not seem too much of a stretch to say that Abner probab ly represents the knowledge itself that we are seek ing: which is just like the Hermit in the Tarot cards - knowledge seeking the seeker, whatever it may look like he i s doing. Abner turns and sees Asahel, and says, '\"Is that yo u, Asahel?\"' Are you separate, Asahel? Do you know 'who you are' , that you are not me, not anyone else - that you a re you, only you? '\"Yes it is.\"' Abner then says to him: '\"There are soldiers all ar ound. Stop chasing me and fight one of them! Kill h im and take his clothes and weapons for yourself.\"' What you are looking for, what you need, is to be f ound all around you. You are not really separate. I t's the very thing you are doing to get what you want that stops you getting what you want. 'But Asahel refused to stop.' Abner then threatens to kill him if he doesn't 'tur n back', adding, '\"Then I could never face your bro ther Joab again.\"' Which is very interesting, because Joab and Abner a re on opposite sides, their armies trying to kill e ach other. Why should he even want to 'face him' again? How can th at which has one face face itself? 'But Asahel would not turn back, so Abner struck hi m in the stomach with the back end of his spear. Th e spear went all the way through and came out of his back. Asahe l fell down and died.' The front end of a spear is the sharp, fine end. Th e back end is the blunt, clumsy end. Asahel has run smack into his own nature, and his nature is to be limited: to hav e an end. 'Everyone who saw Asahel lying dead just stopped an d stood still.' The first interval."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Joab and Abishai, who up to this point have not mov ed (which makes little sense if taken literally) th en continue the chase: the third force energy, from 'the source', f ills the gap. The removal of Asahel also means the changing of Abishai's significance as representing the passive force. His accompanying Joab may be taken to indica te an unused potential, perhaps, the potential of everything the left brain keeps in check. 'Finally, about sunset, they came to the hill of Am mah, not far from Giah on the road to Gibeon Desert .' Abner gathers his men, of the tribe of Benjamin, on a hil l. He shouts to Joab, '\"Aren't we ever going to sto p killing each other? Don't you know that the longer we keep on do ing this, the worse it's going to be when it's all over? When are you going to order your men to stop chasing your ow n relatives?\" 'Joab shouted back, \"I swear by the living God, if you hadn't spoken, my men would have chased their r elatives all night!\" Joab took his trumpet and blew the signal f or his soldiers to stop chasing the soldiers of Isr ael. Right away, the fighting stopped. 'Abner and his troops marched through the Jordan Ri ver valley all that night. Then they crossed the ri ver and marched all morning until they arrived back at Maha naim.' The second interval ('right away, the fighting stop ped') is filled by the understanding of which Asahe l was incapable, the realization of the shared reality ('your own re latives') that, ultimately, is at least as much a m atter of resting and allowing to be given as it is of going after and ta king.
