[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" 1 A Study on Cherubim CHERUBIM Prof. M.M.Ninan The word cherub ( cherubim is the Hebrew masculine plural) is a word borrowed from the Assyrian kirubu , from karâbu , \"to be near\", hence it means near ones, familiars , personal servants, bodyguards, courtiers. It was commonly used of those heavenly spirits, who cl osely surrounded the Majesty of God and paid Him intimate service. Hence it came to mean as much as \"Angelic Spirit\". (The change from K of Karâbu , to K of Kirub is nothing unusual in Assyrian. The word has been brou ght into connection with the Egyptian Xefer by metathesis from Xeref=K-r-bh. ) A similar metathesis and play upon sound undoubte dly exists between Kerub and Rakab , \"to ride\", and Merkeba , \"chariot\". The late Jewish explanation by analogy between Kerub and Rekûb , \"a youth\", seems worthless. The word ought to be pronounced in English qerub and querubim , and not with a soft ch. “So the Christian Church from the first accepted th e personality of the cherubim and early adopted Phi lo's interpretation of the name. Clem. Alex.: \"The name Cherubim intends to show much understanding ( aisthesin pollen ).\" (Stromata, V, 240.) Though counted amongst the angels during the first centuries of Christianity, the cherubim and seraphim were not me ntioned in the lists of the angelic hierarchy. At f irst but seven choirs of angels were reckoned, i.e. those en umerated (Eph., i, 21 and Col., i, 16), with the ad dition of angeli et archangeli. Thus St. Irenaeus, Haer.II, xxx, and Origen, Peri archon , I, v.

The cherubim and seraphim were sometimes thought to be but other names for thrones and virtues (Gregory of Nyssa, \"Contra Eunom.\", I; Augustine in Ps., xc viii, 3). Since Psuedo-Dionys., De Caelesti Hier. (writte n about A.D. 500), the ninefold division of the ang elic order has been practically universal; and the cheru bim and seraphim take the highest place in the hier archy, a rank which was ascribed to them already by St. Cy ril of Jerusalem (370) and by St. Chrysostom (about 400), and which Pope Gregory the Great, once aprocrisarius or nuncio at Constantinople, made familiar to the West. Pope Gregory divided the nine anglic orde rs into three choirs, the highest choir being: thro nes, cherubim, and seraphim. Of the cherubim he says (Ho m. in Ev., xxxiv, 10), that cherubim means \"the fulness of knowledge, and these most sublime hosts are thus called, because they are filled with a knowledge which is the more perfect as they are all owed to behold the glory of God more closely\". This explanation of St. Gregory is ultimately derived fr om Philo's similar statement, and was already combi ned with the Old Testament function of the cherubim by St. Augustine in his sublime comment on Ps., lxxix, 2, \"Who sitteth upon the Cherubim\": Cherubim means the Seat of the Glory of God and is interpreted: Fulness of Knowledge. Though we realiz e that cherubim are exalted heavenly powers and virtu es; yet if thou wilt, thou too shalt be one of the cherubim. For if cherubim means, Seat of God, remem ber what the Scripture says: The soul of the just i s the Seat of Wisdom. “ (Catholic Encyclopaedia) \u0001 \u0002\u0001 Cherubim are first mentioned in connection with the expulsion of our Adam and Eve from Eden Gen 3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and t he flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep th e way of the tree of life.

Eze 1:13 As for the likeness of the living creatur es, their appearance was like burning coals of fire , like the appearance of torches: the fire went up and down among the living creatures; and t he fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. Eze 1:14 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. Eze 1:15 Now as I beheld the living creatures, beh old, one wheel upon the earth beside the living cre atures, for each of the four faces thereof. Eze 1:16 The appearance of the wheels and their wo rk was like unto a beryl: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was a s it were a wheel within a wheel.

We should remember that Ezekiel is describing somet hing of which he has no idea. He sees the four liv ing beings with several wings and he also sees wheels a nd wheels within the wheels. He sees all the four cherubs as one unity, united in motion and somehow related to the wheels. They rose up and flew and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 landed.

Here the position of the cherubim are slightly changed and appears to be in the Guarding position. These have led to the explanation that Cherubim are body guards and vehicle carriers of th e Lord. Ezekiel's vision of the Cherubim, which is practically the same in the tenth chapter as in the first, is one of the most difficult in Scripture, and has given rise to a multitude of explanations. \u0001 \u0001 “The prophet first saw a luminous cloud coming from the north; from a distance it seemed a heavy cloud fringed with light and some intense brilliancy in t he centre thereof, bright as gold, yet in perpetual motion as the flames of a fire. Within that heavenly fire he began gradually to distinguish four living beings w ith bodies as men, yet with four faces each: a human fa ce in front, but an eagles face behind; a lion's fa ce to the left and an ox's face to the right. Though approach ing, yet their knees did not bend in their march, s traight and stiff they remained; and for feet they had the hoofs of oxen, shod as it were with shining brass. They had four arms, two to each shoulder, and attached a long each arm a wing. Of these four winged arms two were outstretched above, and two were let down and covered their bodies. These four living beings stoo d together, facing in four opposite directions, and b etween them were four great wheels, each wheel bein g double, so that it could roll forward or sideways.

So in Hebrews we read : Heb 9:5 and above it cherubim of glory overshadowi ng the mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak severally. Was the cloud and lightning simply a fast movement of these living beings?. \u0002 Are they Real or Imaginary? Eston and other protestant theologicans interprets them as simply symbolic and not real. This may be traditional obstinacy to accept other living beings . While western rationalistic period refused to ackno wledge extraterrestrials simply because it might overthrow the superiority of man. However all the rest of the world accepted the coex istence of other beings both embodied and disembodi ed here on earth as well as outside the earth in this dimension and in other dimensions as well. For the Africans and the Indians a spiritual world is alway s near us and inside and around us. “Notwithstanding the present common opinion of adva nced Protestant scholars, that cherubim are only symbolic representations of abstract ideas, the Cat holic Church undoubtedly holds that there are actua lly existing spiritual beings corresponding to the name . That Old Testament writers used the word cherubim to designate angels, not merely to express ideas, can be best gathered from Gen., iii, 24, where God sets cherubim at the entrance of Paradise. This sentence would bear no sense at all if cherubim did not sta nd for ministerial beings, differing from man, carrying ou t the behest of God . Likewise, it is difficult to read Ezechiel and to persuade oneself that the Prophet d oes not presuppose the actual existence of real per sonal beings under the name of Cherubim; in chaps. i and x he speaks again and again of \"living beings\", and he says the spirit of life was within them, and repeat edly points out that the bodily forms he sees are b ut appearances of the living beings thus mentioned” (C atholic Encyclopaedia) The office of the Cherubim were, (1.) on the expulsion of our first parents from Ede n, to prevent all access to the tree of life; and (2.) to form the throne and chariot of Jehovah in h is manifestation of himself on earth.

These subtleties are rooted in the fact that the Classical Egyptian language was written in Hierogly phics.

Aquarius, the man with a stream of water, Leo were the original zodiacal constellations of th e two solstices, Taurus was that of the spring equi nox, and Aquila and Serpens were close to the autumnal equin ox Thus the four cherubim represented the entire cosmo s – the four quarters of the cosmos also.

Again it is this unity that represents the perfecti on in every Son of Goad. Thus in one sense the Che rubs represent the pecfected beings of the cosmos. Thus we do see many interpreters tend to identify the Cherubim as perfected saints in the presence of God serving him day in and day out and praising him an d acting as angels of mercy. If this looks like the Brahma, the creator with his four heads is it a coincidence? Remember that we are simply representing some concept in a visual artist ic form. When a symbol becomes a target of worship it beocmes an idol. \u0002 The Covering Cherub Concept: Cherubs are human ima gination The office of the Cherubim were, (1.) on the expulsion of our first parents from Ede n, to prevent all access to the tree of life; and (2.) to form the throne and chariot of Jehovah in h is manifestation of himself on earth. He”dwelleth b etween and sitteth on the cherubim “ (1Sa_4:4; Psa_80:1; Eze_1:26, Eze_1:28). \u0001\u0002 Cherubim covered the mercy Seat of God. God spoke from between the cherubs. No one can see God and live. So the form of God is covered by the wings o f the cherubim. \u0001\u0002 In a slight variation of thought . the Hebrew term may mean \"cherub of anointing, who covers\", therefo re a royal, anointed being, overshadowing others with it s wings to shelter them. If this be so, we must add royalty and beneficence to the characteristics of c herubim. \u0001\u0002 Symbolicaly Cherubims become the covering which mak es man difficult to see God as he really is. Rather than beaming rays of sunshine, they will see imaginary figures streaking through their minds. For you see, according to Strong's Exhaustive Concordan ce the word, cherubim, comes from the Hebrew word, keruwbim , which is a transliteration and means \" imaginary figures .\" Keruwbim (cherubim) is the plural of keruwb (cherub). Simply put, THE CHERUBIM ARE IMAGINATIONS which find their roots in the imaginative mind of man."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 Perhaps we can see why the cherubim were sewn into the veil, that which represents man's mind, and is the obstacle which separates him from the Most Holy Place . The curtains of the tabernacle also contained cherubim, as well as the two doors of the temple, not to mention the walls. Everywhere in the tabernacle and the temple cherubim were sewn and made. This was fo r the purpose of keeping carnality out of the Holy of the holies, which is the same as the midst of the G arden. “The heavenly mysteries are covered with a golden p ot on earth” (Manusmriti) \u0002 Cherubims are the picture of Man Another interesting thought with great stretch of i magination is given below. Seraphim and Cherubim are known to be Angels dwelli ng in the Angelic realm. The Seraphim and Cherubim live upon the sea of glass in the future from our day. The Angels in heaven are our future ( or like our future as those beings that went ahead of us), just as we are their past. The Angels round about the sea of glass were once humans upon the earth. God destroyed the first creation where the Angels o f heaven had once lived as humans. God destroyed t he first creation because God had created the first hu mans with hearts and minds knowing both good and ev il, which God realized by experience would not work. Go d realized that evil and good could not live togeth er in harmony side by side. Therefore, the first creat ion (the creation before that of Adam and Eve) was destroyed in a flood of water, as seen in Genesis 1 :2 where the earth is shown to be covered in water. The Angels in heaven were once humans upon the earth in the first creation. There is nothing new in our wo rld. All that has taken place since the re-creation of A dam and Eve, has already been. When Adam and Eve were created (as described in the book of Genesis) they were told to REPLENISH (repopulate) the earth; which means to restore the earth with people as it once was in the first creat ion. In Isa.6:2 the Seraphim have six wings as opposed to the Cher ubim who have four wings in Eze.10:15,21. The Angels in heaven (upon the sea of glass) do not have literal wings. Their bodies are of a physical nature, however their bodies are more glorious than our hum an earthly bodies. The Angels being described as having wings reveals that they are heavenly beings who have ascended from the first earth to their new abode in heaven upon the sea of glass. The Angels in heaven are upon all twelve planets in our solar system in the future of our day. As it w as in the Garden of Eden at the time of Adam and Eve is h ow it is upon all twelve planets (stars) where the Angels dwell; however, the abode of the Angels is f ar more glorious than the earth at the time of Adam and Eve. The sea of glass (diamond) is around the earth in t he future. Upon the sea of glass are trees, rivers, animals and atmosphere, as the world upon the sea of glass is an image of the earth as it was at the time of A dam and Eve (Garden of Eden). Beneath the sea of glass (diamond) are the twelve foundations of gemstones; the sea of glass (diamond) is the top layer. Above the diamond covering are trees, plants, animals, and th e Angelic beings. The city called New Jerusalem in Re v.21:10,14 has twelve foundations. The city New Jerusalem is of the future world that is upon the s ea of glass (diamond). God’s throne (Shekinah Glory ) is within the city New Jerusalem. Before God’s throne is the only section of the sea of glass that is not covered with soil, grass, trees and so forth, see Rev.4:6. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 The Angels who dwell in heaven are in physical bodi es which are like human bodies, yet are far more glorious than Adam or Eve’s. The Angelic beings can not physically leave their abode upon the sea of gl ass, though their spirit can leave their physical bodies and travel through time and space. The spiritsof A ngels are permitted to be among us upon the earth, and th ey can return to their physical bodies at will. The spirits within the Angels are the same spirits within humans. In other words, it is as if two iden tical spirits are in two bodies (one Angelic, one human) in two different time periods (one of the future, o ne of the past). The wicked angelic spirits who rebelled in heaven a re of the same spirits who are in human form, who s hall rebel against God by rejecting God’s revealed word. These are however too farfetched imagination vergin g on science fiction. We wont be able to find bibl ical foundation for this imaginative interesting concept . \u0002\u0001 The four worlds of the Kabballah \"Kabbalah\" means \"received teachings\" or simply \"tr aditions\" and is derived from the Hebrew \"kabel\" which means \"to receive.\" Kabbah (Muslim Kabbah cam e from it) means revelation Kabballah simply means revelations of God It originally applied only to the Oral Law \"received\" after the destruction o f the Second Temple, in the form of the Talmud. Though it was fully developed in the Middle Ages, the firs t seeds of a mystical trend began to emerge in the ta lmudic literature, written well after the destructi on of the Second Temple--from 150 A.D. to 600 A.D. Sepher Yetzirah or the \"Book of Creation.\" is the c anonical text for the later kabbalistic movement wh ich developed the workings and the origin of the unive rse. It described the sefirot or \"emanations,\" the ten so- called \"manifestations of God.\" Knowledge of these mysteries was thought to confer magical powers on t he initiated. . An understanding of the kabballah traiditions give s the background information for the Biblical mytho logy. It talks about four worlds of existence that have e manated from Ein-Sof who dwells in darkness and who cannot be known. These are: 1. ATZILUTH The Divine or Archetypal World. The Yod of Tetragrammaton. Secret Name: AB - Father Element - Fire. Atziluth is the highest plane of Creation. It is th e well spring from which everything emerges. It is difficult for the Human mind to comprehend the workings or th e ideas that are associated with such high realms o f consciousness. The very essence of pure thought and to some extent the very mind of the Creator may be glimpsed briefly in the Realm of Atziluth. Atziluth is administered by the Highest of Beings the Cheribim. They would appear to be extremely clo se to the Mind of God, in fact closer than any others. thought and is the backdrop for all that is. Wit hout the Divine influence of Atziluth nothing is Atziluth re presents the ideas that are in the mind of God. Atzilut, the \"World of Emanation\" or \"Nearness (to the Godhead)\", also called the Image and the Heaven ly man ( Adam Kadmon ), is the Divine Reality; the Sefirot or attributes of the Godhead. They are the direct emanation from the En Sof, and hence most intimatel y connected to the absolute Deity, perfect and immutable. It is here that there is the conjunction of the King and Queen (Tifaret and Malkut, represe nting the male and female polarities of the Godhead), fro m which is produced the successive worlds"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 [C.D.Ginsburg, S.A.Cook, \"Kabbalah\", Encyclopeadia Britannica , 11th ed. 1911, vol xv, pp.620-1]. The Sefirot are arranged in three pillars, the Pillar o f Mercy (Hesed) on the left, the Pillar of Judgment or Severity (Gevurah) on the right, and the Pillar of Balance or Compassion or Beauty (Tifaret) in the mi ddle; which together constitute the Divine supervision of the lower worlds 2. BRIAH The Archangelic or Creative world. The First Hek of Tetragrammaton. Secret Name: Seg Element - Water. The world of Briah is the world of early Creation. The Archangels form the governing and ordering body . Briah is most commonly associated with the Element of Water. It is in Briah that the Mighty Archangels appear to establish the Will of God. Briah is where the plans are made and the \"blueprints\" are drawn. Beriah, the \"World of Creation\" is also called \"the Throne\" ten sefirot being further from the En Sof then the sefirot of the universe of Atzilut, are of a more l imited potency, although their substance is still of the p urest nature and without any admixture of matter. T he angel Metatron inhabits this world. He constitutes the wo rld of pure spirit and is the garment of Shaddai , i.e. the visible manifestation of the Divine. He governs the visible world, preserves its harmony, and is head of myriads of angels [C.D.Ginsburg, S.A.Cook, Kabbalah , p.621]. The world of Beriah is described in the Zohar as co nsistinhg of seven higher heavens or firmaments whi ch emanante from the seven lower sefirot of Atzilut, a nd are beyond the traditional seven heavens to whic h the stars and planets are fixed [Paul Krzok, \"The Cosmo logical Structure of the Zohar\", p.32 The Hermetic Journal, no.20, Summer 1983)]. This is also the wor ld of the angels centred around the throne of God. In the Lurianic tradition this is the world where t he tzimtzum is first felt, and hence individual bei ngs are able to exist. (Jacob Immanuel Schochet, Mystical Concepts in Hassidism Kehot Publication Society, Brooklyn New York, 1979, p.110) Inasmuch as the world of Beriah is identified with the Sefirah Binah (and vice -versa) this is region from which the divine soul ( Neshamah ) is derived. 3. YETZIRAH (Formation) Olam ha-Yetzirah. The Angelic or Formative world. The World of thought. The Vau of Tettragrammaton. Secret Name: Mah Element - Air Yetzirah is the World of Formation. This is the rea lm of logic and intelligence. The intellectual worl d represented by the Element of Air. Yetzirah is the world of Angelic Choirs. Here are t he Seraphim and the Elohim. Choirs of Angels bring the resources that are needed to bear for completion in Assiah. Yet they are still non-material. This is the abode of the angels, who are wrapped in luminous garments . The myriads of angels are divided into ten ranks, accor ding to the ten sefirot, and each angel is set ove r a different part of the universe, and derives his nam e from the element or heavenly body he guards [C.D.Ginsburg, S.A.Cook, Kabbalah, p.621]."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 This region is interpreted in the Zohar as the worl d of the lower heavens, consisting of the seven pla ntery firmaments [Paul Krzok, \"The Cosmological Structure of the Zohar\", p.32 The Hermetic Journal, no.20, Summer 1983)]. The pseudepigraphical Massekhet Atzi lut (early 14th Century), places the Archangel Metatron and the angels centred around him are some times placed in the world of Yetzirah rather than Beriahas later became the case [Scholem, Kabbalah , pp.118-9]. 4. ASSIAH Olam ha-Assiah The Material world. The Physical world. The Final Heh of Tettragrammaton. Secret Name: Ben Element - Earth. Assiah is the world of action. this is the material world in which the results of the efforts of God b ecome material. The Ideas that were started in Atziluth r each manifestation in Assiah. The physical universe and Malkuth are the represent ation of Assiah. The four Elements are the primary building blocks and are present in the physical sen se in Assiah. This is the region of are the grossest sefirot, con sisting of material substance. There are ten degree s, each lower than the other. Alternatively, there are seve n earths (the highest presumably being the earth of human beings, i.e. the physical universe) one beneath the other, and beneath the lowest of them, seven hells , again arranged in sequence. In contrast to Christianity, the souls of sinners are there not only to be punis hed but also to be purified, before ascending, the exceptio n being the hell of Abadon, where the soul is appar ently destroyed [Paul Krzok, \"The Cosmological Structure of the Zohar\", The Hermetic Journal , no.20, Summer 1983) pp.33-4].
