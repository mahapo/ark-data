[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"My Qabalah The Supernal Triangle is the uppermost equation in the Tree of Life. From the emanance of Kether , down the 11th Path (The Magician) to the 2nd Sephiroth Chokmah then along the 14th Path (Emperor) to Binah this is the highest representation of God we can summon. In this triangle we have the primal point of life Kether , the first Male energy ( Yang ) Chokmah and the first Female energy ( Yin ) Binah . The ways between these Sephirot hs are much of interest. Firstly the inital burst of energy into our universe from Kether to the 2nd Sephiroth Chokmah via the 11th Path of The Magician shows the first act of creation, illusion and manifestation. Creation from the Male en ergy that manifests as Chokmah . Illusion from the first seperation of energy into a sexual component thus the first illusion that the sexes are different. The 11th Path The Magician is symbolic of these qualaties: Creation, Illusion and Manifestation. Male comes before Female on the Tree of Life due to no greater importance of the two sexes but rather that without Female to follow and actually create the world we know there would be too much Male choas in our reality. The Male ( Chokmah ) here is the first driving force to make something, but without the nuturing creat ive energy of Female ( Binah ) their could be no order to follow in the universe. The 14th Path of The Emperor is the link to make the Male energy of Chokmah directed and manifested upon Binah so she can create her children our reality. Chesed is the next Sephiroth to follow after Binah starts to create our reality and Chesed (Jupiter) is after all the first King symbolizing \"Law and order\". The other Path s of \"The Empress\" and \"The High Priestess\" are interesting in that they are Female symbols while the Path s of \"Magician\" and \"Emperor\" are Male symbols. Before we were fo rcing energy to creat e the Sephiroths. Now these Path s with Female symbols are more nuturing. The Empress is the powerful Path from Gods Son Tiphareth to The Father Kether and is the way of a Messiah from Jesus/Krishna/Buddah/Mohammed to God. It is an impossibly difficult Path for us to concieve and crosses an invisable Sephiroth \"Daath\" that is never drawn on the Tree of Life. The High Priestess is th e return of energy from Chokmah to Kether . It is symbolic of the wisdom that Binah has aquired from her union with Chokmah . All of the Path s can be understood with a knowleadge of the Tarot.
