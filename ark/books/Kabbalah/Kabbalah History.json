[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Introduction ------------ If a chemist from the twentieth century could step into a time-machine and go back two-hundred years he or she would proba bly feel a deep kinship with the chemists of that time, even though there might be considerable differences in terminology, underlying theory, equipment and so on. Despite this kinship, chemists have not been trapped in the past, and the subject as it is studied today bears little resemblance to the chemistry of two hundred years ago. Kabbalah has existed for nearly two thousand years, and like any living discipline it has evolved through time, and it cont inues to evolve. One aspect of this evolution is that it is necessary fo r living Kabbalists to continually \"re-present\" what they understand by Kabbalah so that Kabbalah itself continues to live and continues to retain its usefulness to each new generation. If Kabbalists do not do th is then it becomes a dead thing, an historical curiousity (as was virtua lly the case within Judaism by the nineteenth century). These notes we re written with that intention: to present one view of Kabbalah as it i s currently practised in 1992, so that people who are interested in Kabba lah and want to learn more about it are not limited purely to texts writt en hundreds or thousands of years ago (or for that matter, modern texts written about texts written hundreds or thousands of years ago). For this reason these notes acknowledge the past, but they do not d efer to it. There are many adequate texts for those who wish to under stand Kabbalah as it was practised in the past. These notes have another purpose. The majority of people who are drawn towards Kabbalah are not historians; they are peopl e who want to know enough about it to decide whether they should use i t as part of their own personal mystical or magical adventure. There is enough information not only to make that decision, but also to move fr om theory into practice. I should emphasise that this is only one variation of Kabbalah out of many, and I leave it to others to p resent their own variants - I make no apology if the material is bia sed towards a particular point of view. The word \"Kabbalah\" means \"tradition\". There are m any alternative spellings, the two most popular being Kabbalah and Qabalah, but Cabala, Qaballah, Qabala, Kaballa (and so on) are also seen . I made my choice as a result of a poll of the books on my bookcase, not as a result of deep linguistic understanding. If Kabbalah means \"tradition\", then the core of the tradition was the attempt to penetrate the inner meaning of the Bible , which was taken to be the literal (but heavily veiled) word of God. B ecause the Word was veiled, special techniques were developed to elucid ate the true meaning....Kabbalistic theosophy has been deeply in fluenced by these attempts to find a deep meaning in the Bible. The earliest documents (~100 - ~1000 A.D.) associa ted with Kabbalah describe the attempts of \"Merkabah\" mystics to pene trate the seven halls (Hekaloth) of creation and reach the Merkabah (thro ne-chariot) of God. These mystics used the familiar methods of shamanis m (fasting, repetitious chanting, prayer, posture) to induce tr ance states in which they literally fought their way past terrible seals and guards to reach"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"an ecstatic state in which they \"saw God\". An earl y and highly influential document (Sepher Yetzirah) appears to h ave originated during the earlier part of this period. By the early middle ages further, more theosophical developments had taken place, chiefly a description of \"processes\" w ithin God, and a highly esoteric view of creation as a process in wh ich God manifests in a series of emanations. This doctrine of the \"seph iroth\" can be found in a rudimentary form in the \"Yetzirah\", but by the time of the publication of the book \"Bahir\" (12th. century) it had reached a form not too different from the form it takes today. On e of most interesting characters from this period was Abraham Abulafia, w ho believed that God cannot be described or conceptualised using everyda y symbols, and used the Hebrew alphabet in intense meditations lasting many hours to reach ecstatic states. Because his abstract letter combi nations were used as keys or entry points to altered states of conscious ness, failure to carry through the manipulations correctly could hav e a drastic effect on the Kabbalist. In \"Major Trends in Jewish Mysticis m\" Scholem includes a long extract of one such experiment made by one of Abulafia's students - it has a deep ring of truth about it. Probably the most influential Kabbalistic document, the \"Sepher ha Zohar\", was published by Moses de Leon, a Spanish J ew, in the latter half of the thirteenth century. The \"Zohar\" is a s eries of separate documents covering a wide range of subjects, from a verse-by-verse esoteric commentary on the Pentateuch, to highly th eosophical descriptions of processes within God. The \"Zohar\" has been widely read and was highly influential within mainstream Judais m. A later development in Kabbalah was the Safed schoo l of mystics headed by Moses Cordovero and Isaac Luria. Luria was a hi ghly charismatic leader who exercised almost total control over the life of the school, and has passed into history as something of a saint . Emphasis was placed on living in the world and bringing the cons ciousness of God through *into* the world in a practical way. Pract ices were largely devotional. Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Judaism as a whole was heavily influenced by Kabbalah, but by the begi nning of this century a Jewish writer was able to dismiss it as an histor ical curiousity. Jewish Kabbalah has vast literature which is almost entirely untranslated into English. A development which took place almost synchronously with Jewish Kabbalah was its adoption by many Christian mystics, magicia ns and philosphers. Renaissance philosophers such as Pico della Mirando la were familiar with Kabbalah and mixed it with gnosticism, pythagoreani sm, neo-platonism and hermeticism to form a snowball which continued to p ick up traditions as it rolled down the centuries. It is probably accur ate to say that from the Renaissance on, virtually all European occult p hilosophers and magicians of note had a working knowledge of Kabbal ah. It is not clear how Kabbalah was involved in the pr opagation of ritual magical techniques, or whether it *was* involved, o r whether the ritual techniques were preserved in parallel within Judais m, but it is an undeniable fact that the most influential documents appear to have a Jewish origin. The most important medieval magical text is the \"Key of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Solomon\", and it contains the elements of classic r itual magic - names of power, the magic circle, ritual implements, cons ecration, evocation of spirits etc. No-one knows how old it is, but th ere is a reasonable suspicion that its contents preserve techniques whi ch might well date back to Solomon. The combination of non-Jewish Kabbalah and ritual m agic has been kept alive outside Judaism until the present day, althou gh it has been heavily adulterated at times by hermeticism, gnosti cism, neo-platonism, pythagoreanism, rosicrucianism, christianity, tantr a and so on. The most important \"modern\" influences are the French m agician Eliphas Levi, and the English \"Order of the Golden Dawn\". At lea st two members of the G.D. (S.L. Mathers and A.E. Waite) were knowledg able Kabbalists, and three G. D. members have popularised Kabbalah - A leister Crowley, Israel Regardie, and Dion Fortune. Dion Fortune's \"Inner Light\" has also produced a number of authors: Gareth Knight, William Butler, and William Gray. An unfortunate side effect of the G.D is that while Kabbalah was an important part of its \"Knowledge Lectures\", survivi ng G.D. rituals are a syncretist hodge-podge of symbolism in which Kabb alah plays a minor or nominal role, and this has led to Kabbalah being se en by many modern occultists as more of a theoretical and intellectua l discipline, rather than a potent and self-contained mystical and magic al system in its own right. Some of the originators of modern witchcraft drew h eavily on medieval ritual and Kabbalah for inspiration, and it is not unusual to find witches teaching some form of Kabbalah, although it is generally even less well integrated into practical technique than in the case of the G.D. The Kabbalistic tradition described in the notes de rives principally from Dion Fortune, but has been substantially devel oped over the past 30 years. I would like to thank M.S. and the T.S.H.U. for all the fun. Chapter 1.: The Tree of Life At the root of the Kabbalistic view of the wo rld are three fundamental concepts and they provide a natural pl ace to begin. The three concepts are force, form and consciousn ess and these words are used in an abstract way, as the follo wing examples illustrate: - high pressure steam in the cylinder of a steam engine provides a force. The engine is a form which constrains the force. - a river runs downhill under the force of gravity. The river channel is a form which constrains the w ater to run in a well defined path. - someone wants to get to the centre of a gard en maze. The hedges are a form which constrain that person 's ability to walk as they please. - a diesel engine provides the force which d rives a boat"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" forwards. A rudder constrains its course to a given direction. - a polititian wants to change the law. Th e legislative framework of the country is a form which he or she must follow if the change is to be made legally. - water sits in a bowl. The force of gravity p ulls the water down. The bowl is a form which gives its shape to the water. - a stone falls to the ground under the force of gravity. Its acceleration is constrained to be equal to the force divided by the mass of the stone. - I want to win at chess. The force of my des ire to win is constrained within the rules of chess. - I see something in a shop window and have to have it. I am constrained by the conditions of sale (do I have enough money, is it in stock). - cordite explodes in a gun barrel and provide s an explosive force on a bullet. The gas and the bullet are constrained by the form of the gun barrel. - I want to get a passport. The government won 't give me one unless I fill in lots of forms in precisely th e right way. - I want a university degree. The university won't give me a degree unless I attend certain courses and pass various assessments. In all these examples there is something which is c ausing change to take place (\"a force\") and there is something which causes change to take place in a defined way (\"a form\"). Without being too pedantic it is possible to identify two very di fferent types of example here: 1. examples of natural physical processes (e. g. a falling stone) where the force is one of the natural f orces known to physics (e.g. gravity) and the form is is som e combination of physical laws which constrain the force to act in a well defined way. 2. examples of people wanting something, wher e the force is some ill-defined concept of \"desire\", \"will\", or \"drives\", and the form is one of the forms we impose u pon ourselves (the rules of chess, the Law, polite behaviour etc.). Despite the fact that the two different types of example are \"only metaphorically similar\", Kabbalists see n o fundamental distiniction between them. To the Kabbalist ther e are forces which cause change in the natural world, an d there are corresponding psychological forces which drive us t o change both the world and ourselves, and whether these forces are natural or psychological they are rooted in the same place: consciousness. Similarly, there are forms which the component parts of the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"physical world seem to obey (natural laws) a nd there are completely arbitrary forms we create as part of th e process of living (the rules of a game, the shape of a mug, th e design of an engine, the syntax of a language) and these forms a re also rooted in the same place: consciousness. It is a Kabbalis tic axiom that there is a prime cause which underpins all the mani festations of force and form in both the natural and psychologic al world and that prime cause I have called consciousness for la ck of a better word. Consciousness is undefinable. We know that we are conscious in different ways at different times - sometimes we feel free and happy, at other times trapped and confused, somet imes angry and passionate, sometimes cold and restrained - but these words describe manifestations of consciousness. We ca n define the manifestations of consciousness in terms of mani festations of consciousness, which is about as useful as definin g an ocean in terms of waves and foam. Anyone who attempt s to define consciousness itself tends to come out of the same door as they went in. We have lots of words for the phenomena of consciousness - thoughts, feelings, beliefs, desires, emotions, motives and so on - but few words for the states of consciousnes s which give rise to these phenomena, just as we have many word s to describe the surface of a sea, but few words to describe its depths. Kabbalah provides a vocabulary for states of consciousness underlying the phenomena, and one of the purposes of these notes is to explain this vocabulary, not by definition, but mostly by metaphor and analogy. The only genuine method of understanding what the vocabulary means is by attaining vario us states of consciousness in a predictable and reasonably objec tive way, and Kabbalah provides practical methods for doing this. A fundamental premise of the Kabbalistic model of reality is that there is a pure, primal, and undefina ble state of consciousness which manifests as an interaction bet ween force and form. This is virtually the entire guts of the Kab balistic view of things, and almost everything I have to say fr om now on is based on this trinity of consciousness, forc e, and form. Consciousness comes first, but hidden within it i s an inherent duality; there is an energy associated with consci ousness which causes change (force), and there is a cap acity within consciousness to constrain that energy and cause i t to manifest in a well-defined way (form).  First Principle  of   / Consciousness \\   / \\  / \\  Capacity Raw  to take ________________ Energy Form    Figure 1.    What do we get out of raw energy and an inbuilt cap acity for form and structure? Is there yet another hidden potenti al within this trinity waiting to manifest? There is. If modern ph ysics is to be believed we get matter and the physical world. The cosmological Big Bang model of raw energy surging out from an infintesimal"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"point and condensing into basic forms of matter as it cools, then into stars and galaxies, then planets, and ulti mately living creatures, has many points of similarity with th e Kabbalistic model. In the Big Bang model a soup of energy conde nses according to some yet-to-be-formulated Grand-Universal-The ory into our physical world. What Kabbalah does suggest (and m odern physics most certainly does not!) is that matter and cons ciousness are the same stuff, and differ only in the degree of structure imposed - matter is consciousness so heavily s tructured and constrained that its behaviour becomes describab le using the regular and simple laws of physics. This is shown in Fig. 2. The primal, first principle of consciousness is synony mous with the idea of \"God\".

The first principle of consciousness is called Kether, which means Crown. The raw energy of consciousness is called Chockhma h or Wisdom, and the capacity to give form to the energy of con sciousness is called Binah, which is sometimes translated as Unde rstanding, and sometimes as Intelligence. The outcome of the i nteraction of force and form, the physical world, called Malkut h or Kingdom. This quaternery is a Kabbalistic representation of God-the- Knowable, in the sense that it the most primitive representation of God we are capable of comprehending; paradoxica lly, Kabbalah also contains a notion of God-the-Unknowable whi ch transcends this glyph, and is called En Soph. There is not m uch I can say about En Soph, and what I can say I will postpone f or later. God-the-Knowable has four aspects, two male a nd two female: Kether and Chokhmah are both represented as male, and Binah and Malkuth are represented as female. One of the titl es of Chokhmah is Abba, which means Father, and one of the title s of Binah is Aima, which means Mother, so you can think of Cho khmah as God- the-Father, and Binah as God-the-Mother. Ma lkuth is the daughter, the female spirit of God-as-Matter, and i t would not be wildly wrong to think of her as Mother Earth. One of the more pleasant things about Kabbalah is that its symbolis m gives equal place to both male and female. And what of God-the-Son? Is there also a G od-the-Son in Kabbalah? There is, and this is the point where Ka bbalah tackles the interesting problem of thee and me.

The ef fect of self- consciousness as shown in Fig. 4 is to drive a wed ge between the First Principle of Consciousness (Kether) and that Consciousness realised as matter and the physical world (Malku th). This is called \"the Fall\", after the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. From a Kabbalistic point of view the story of Eden, with the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, the ser pent and the temptation, and the casting out from the Garden ha s a great deal of meaning in terms of understanding the evolution of consciousness. Self-consciousness introduces four new states of consciousness: the Consciousness of Consciousne ss is called Tipheret, which means Beauty; the Consciousness o f Force/Energy is called Netzach, which means Victory or F irmness; the Consciousness of Form is called Hod, which means Splendour or Glory, and the Consciousness of Matter is called Yesod, which means Foundation. These four states have readi ly observable manifestations, as shown below in Fig. 5:    The Self  Self-Importance  Self-Sacrifice  / | \\   / | \\  / | \\  Language | Emotions  Abstraction_______________Drives Reason | Feelings  \\ | / \\ | /  \\ | / \\ Perception /  Imagination  Instinct  Reproduction    Figure 5 Figure 4. is almost the complete Tree of Life, bu t not quite - there are still two states missing. The inherent capacity of consciousness to take on structure and objectify i tself (Binah, God-the-Mother) is reflected through self-consci ousness as a perception of the limitedness and boundedness of th ings. We are conscious of space and time, yesterday and today, h ere and there, you and me, in and out, life and death, whole and broken, together and apart. We see things as limited and b ounded and we have a perception of form as something \"created\" an d \"destroyed\". My car was built a year ago, but it was smashed yesterday.

This perception acts like an \"interface\" between the quaternary of conscio usness which represents \"God\", and the quaternary which repres ents a living self-conscious being, and two new states are introduced to represent this interface. The state which represent s the creation of new forms is called Chesed, which means Mercy, and the state which represents the destruction of forms is ca lled Gevurah, which means Strength. This is shown in F ig. 6. The objectification of forms which takes place in a self-conscious being, and the consequent tendency to view the wor ld in terms of limitations and dualities (time and space, here an d there, you and me, in and out, God and Man, good and evil.. .) produces a barrier to perception which most people rarely over come, and for this reason it has come to be called the Abyss.

The"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"constructionist\" approach I have used to justify its structure is a little unusual, but the essence of my presen tation can be found in the \"Zohar\" under the guise of the Macr oprosopus and Microprosopus, although in this form it is not read ily accessible to the average reader. My attempt to show how the Tree of Life can be derived out of pure consciousness through th e interaction of an abstract notion of force and form was not int ended to be a convincing exercise from an intellectual point of v iew - the Tree of Life is primarily a gnostic rather than a rational or intellectual explanation of consciousness and it s interaction with the physical world. The Tree is composed of 10 states or sephiro th (sephiroth plural, sephira singular) and 22 interconnecting p aths. The age of this diagram is unknown: there is enough infor mation in the 13th. century \"Sepher ha Zohar\" to construct this diagram, and the doctrine of the sephiroth has been attributed to Isaac the Blind in the 12th. century, but we have no certai n knowledge of its origin. It probably originated sometime in the interval between the 6th. and 13th. centuries AD. The orig in of the word \"sephira\" is unclear - it is almost certainly deri ved from the Hebrew word for \"number\" (SPhR), but it has also b een attributed to the Greek word for \"sphere\" and even to the Hebr ew word for a sapphire (SPhIR). With a characteristic aptitude f or discovering hidden meanings everywhere, Kabbalists find all thr ee derivations useful, so take your pick. In the language of earlier Kabbalistic writers the sephiroth represented ten primeval emanations of God, ten focii through which the energy of a hidden, absolute and unknow n Godhead (En Soph) propagated throughout the creation, like white light passing through a prism. The sephiroth can be i nterpreted as aspects of God, as states of consciousness, or as nodes akin to the Chakras in the occult anatomy of a human bei ng . I have left out one important detail from the structure of the Tree. There is an eleventh \"something\" which is definitely *not* a sephira, but is often shown on modern repr esentations of the Tree. The Kabbalistic \"explanation\" runs as follows: when Malkuth \"fell\" out of the Garden of Eden (Fig. 2) it left behind a \"hole\" in the fabric of the Tree, and this \"hole \", located in the centre of the Abyss, is called Daath, or Know ledge. Daath is *not* a sephira; it is a hole. This may sound like gobbledy-gook, and in the sense that it is only a metaphor, it is. The completed Tree of Life with the Hebrew t itles of the sephiroth is shown below in Fig. 7.

The Tree continues to be used in the Twentieth Century be cause it has proved to be a useful and productive symbol for pr actices of a magical, mystical and religious nature. Modern Ka bbalah in the Western Mystery Tradition is largely concerne d with the understanding and practical application of the Tree of Life, and the following set of notes will list some of the c haracteristics of each sephira in more detail so that you will hav e a \"snapshot\" of what each sephira represents before going on to examine the sephiroth and the \"deep structure\" of the Tree in m ore detail. *************************************************** ************************* Chapter 2.: Sephirothic Correspondences The correspondences are a set of symbols, ass ociations and qualities which provide a handle on the elusive something a sephira represents. Some of the correspondences ar e hundreds of years old, many were concocted this century, and so me are my own; some fit very well, and some are obscure - oddly enough it is often the most obscure and ill-fitting corresponde nce which is most productive; like a Zen riddle it perplexes a nd annoys the mind until it arrives at the right place more in spite of the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"correspondence than because of it. There are few canonical correspondences; some of the sephiroth have alternative names, some of th e names have alternative translations, the mapping from Hebrew spellings to the English alphabet varies from one author to t he next, and inaccuracies and accretions are handed down lik e the family silver. I keep my Hebrew dictionary to hand but gua rantee none of the English spellings. The correspondences I have given are as follow s: 1. The Meaning is a translation of the Hebre w name of the sephira. 2. The Planet in most cases is the planet as sociated with the sephira. In some cases it is not a p lanet at all (e.g. the fixed stars). The planets are ordered by decreasing apparent motion - t his is one correspondence which appears to pre-date C opernicus! 3. The Element is the physical element (earth , water, air, fire, aethyr) which has most in common wi th the nature of the Sephira. The Golden Dawn applied an excess of logic to these attributions and made a mes s of them, to the confusion of many. Only the fiv e Lower Face sephiroth have been attributed an element. 4. Briatic colour. This is the colour of th e sephira as seen in the world of Creation, Briah. Th ere are colour scales for the other three worlds but I haven't found them to be useful in practical work. 5. Magical Image. Useful in meditiations; som e are astute. 6. The Briatic Correspondence is an abstract quality which says something about the essence of the way the sephira expresses itself. 7. The Illusion characterises the way in whi ch the energy of the sephira clouds one's judgement; it is something which is *obviously* true. Most people su ffer from one or more of these according to their temper ament. 8. The Obligation is a personal quality whic h is demanded of an initiate at this level. 9. The Virtue and Vice are the energy of the sephiroth as it manifests in a positive and negative sense in the personality. 10. Qlippoth is a word which means \"shell\". In medieval Kabbalah each sephira was \"seen\" to be ad ding form to the sephira which preceded it in the Li ghtning Flash (see Chapter 3.). Form was seen to an accr etion, a shell around the pure divine energy of the Godh ead, and each layer or shell hid the divine radiance a little bit more, until God was buried in form and exi led in matter, the end-point of the process. At the time attitudes to"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" matter were tainted with the Manichean notion that matter was evil, a snare for the spirit, and consequently the Qlippoth or shells were \" demonised\" and actually turned into demons. The correspo ndence I have given here restores the original notion o f a shell of form *without* the corresponding force to activate it; it is the lifeless, empty husk of a seph ira devoid of force, and while it isn't a literal demon , it is hardly a bundle of laughs when you come across it . 11. The Command refers to the Four Powers of the Sphinx, with an extra one added for good measure. 12. The Spiritual Experience is just that. 13. The Titles are a collection of alternative names for the sephira; most are very old. 14. The God Name is a key to invoking the power of the sephira in the world of emanation, Atzilut h. 13.

The prima ry concept was called consciousness, and it was said to \"contain\" within it the two complementary concepts of force and form. This chapter builds on the idea by introducing the three Pillars of t he Tree, and uses the Pillars to clarify a process called the Li ghtning Flash. The Three Pillars are shown in Figure 8. below .

The pillar of consciousness contains the sephiroth Kether, Tiphereth, Yesod an d Malkuth; the pillar of force contains the sephiroth Chokhmah , Chesed and Netzach; the pillar of form contains the sephiroth Binah, Gevurah and Hod. In older Kabbalistic texts the pillars ar e referred to as the pillars of mildness, mercy and severity, and it is not immediately obvious how the older jargon relates to the new. To the medieval Kabbalist (and this is a recurring me taphor in the Zohar) the creation as an emanation of God i s a delicate *balance* (metheqela) between two opposing tendenci es: the mercy of God, the outflowing, creative, life-giving a nd sustaining tendency in God, and the severity or strict judgeme nt of God, the limiting, defining, life-taking and ultimately wrathful or destructive tendency in God. The creation is \"energ ised\" by these two tendencies as if stretched between the poles of a battery. Modern Kabbalah makes a half-hearted attempt to remove the more obvious anthropomorphisms in the descriptio ns of \"God\"; mercy and severity are misleading terms, apt to re mind one of a man with a white beard, and even in medieval times the terms had distinctly technical meanings as the following qu otation shows [1]: \"It must be remembered that to the Kabbalist, judgement [Din - judgement, another title of Gevurah] means the imposition of limits and the correct determination of thi ngs. According to Cordovero the quality of judgement is inherent in everything insofar as everything wishes to re main what it is, to stay within its boundaries.\" I understand the word \"form\" in precisely this sense - it is that which defines *what* a thing is, the structure wh ereby a given thing is distinct from every other thing. As for \"consciousness\", I use the word \"consc iousness\" in a"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"sense so abstract that it is virtually meaningless, and according to whim I use the word God instead, where it is un derstood that both words are placeholders for something which i s potentially knowable in the gnostic sense only - consciou sness can be *defined* according to the *forms* it takes, in whi ch case we are defining the forms, *not* the consciousness . The same qualification applies to the word \"force\". My inabi lity to define two of the three concepts which underpin the stru cture of the Tree is a nuisance which is tackled traditionally by the use of extravagent metaphors, and by elimination (\"n ot this, not that\"). The classification of sephiroth into three pil lars is a way of saying that each sephira in a pillar partakes of a common quality which is \"inherited\" in a progressively m ore developed and structured form from of the top of a pillar to the bottom. Tipheret, Yesod and Malkuth all share with Kether the quality of \"consciousness in balance\" or \"synthesis of opposin g qualities\", or but in each case it is expressed differently acc ording to the increased degree of structure imposed. Likewise, Ch okhmah, Chesed and Netzach share the quality of force or energy or expansiveness, and Binah, Gevurah and Hod share t he quality of form, definition and limitation. From Kether dow n to Malkuth, force and form are combined; the symbolism of the Tree has something in common with a production line, with molten metal coming in one end and finished cars coming out th e other, and with that metaphor we are now ready to describe the Lightning Flash, the process whereby God takes on flesh, the process which created and sustains the creation. In the beginning...was Something. Or Nothing . It doesn't really matter which term we use, as both are equal ly meaningless in this context. Nothing is probably the better of the two terms, because I can use Something in the next paragrap h. Kabbalists call this Nothing \"En Soph\" which literally means \"no end\" or infinity, and understand by this a hidden, unman ifest God-in- Itself. Out of this incomprehensible and indescribable Nothing came Something. Probably more words have been devoted t o this moment than any other in Kabbalah, and it is all too eas y to make fun the effort which has gone into elaborating the inde scribable, so I won't, but in return do not expect me t o provide a justification for why Something came out of Nothing . It just did. A point crystallised in the En Soph. In some ver sions of the story the En Soph \"contracted\" to \"make room\" for the creation (Isaac Luria's theory of Tsimtsum), and this is probably an important clarification for those who have rubbed n oses with the hidden face of God, but for the purposes of these notes it is enough that a point crystallised. This point was the crown of creation, the sephira Kether, and within Kether was contained all the unrealised potential of the creation. An aspect of Kether is the raw creative force of God which blasts into the creation like the blast of hot gas which keeps a hot air ballon in the air. Kabbalists are quite cle ar about this; the creation didn't just happen a long time ago - i t is happening all the time, and without the force to sustain it the creation would crumple like a balloon. The force-like aspect within Kether is the sephira Chokhmah and it can be thought of a s the will of"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"God, because without it the creation would cease to *be*. The whole of creation is maintained by this ravening, p rimeval desire to *be*, to become, to exist, to change, to evolve. The experiential distinction between Kether, the point of emanation, and Chokhmah, the creative outpouring, is elusive , but some of the difference is captured in the phrases \"I am\" and \"I become\". Force by itself achieves nothing; it needs to be contained, and the balloon analogy is appropriate again. Chok hmah contains within it the necessity of Binah, the Mother of Fo rm. The person who taught me Kabbalah (a woman) told me Chokhma h (Abba, the Father) was God's prick, and Binah (Aima, the mot her) was God's womb, and left me with the picture of one half of God continuously ejaculating into the other half. The author of the Zohar also makes frequent use of sexual polarity a s a metaphor to describe the relationship between force and form , or mercy and severity (although the most vivid sexual metaphors are used for the marriage of the Microprosopus and his bride, the Queen and Inferior Mother, the sephira Malkuth). The sephira Binah is the Mother of Form; form exists within Binah as a potentiality, not as an actuality, ju st as a womb contains the potential of a baby. Without the p ossibility of form, no thing would be distinct from any other th ing; it would be impossible to distinguish between things, impos sible to have individuality or identity or change. The Mot her of Form contains the potential of form within her womb and gives birth to form when a creative impulse crosses the Abyss to the Pillar of Force and emanates through the sephira Chesed. Aga in we have the idea of \"becoming\", of outflowing creative energy, but at a lower level. The sephira Chesed is the point at which form becomes perciptible to the mind as an inspiration, an ide a, a vision, that \"Eureka!\" moment immediately prior to ru shing around shouting \"I've got it! I've got it!\" Chesed is th at quality of genuine inspiration, a sense of being \"plugg ed in\" which characterises the visionary leaders who drive th e human race onwards into every new kind of endeavour. It can b e for good or evil; a leader who can tap the petty malice and vin dictiveness in any person and channel it into a vision of a n ew order and genocide is just as much a visionary as any ot her, but the positive side of Chesed is the humanitarian leade r who brings about genuine improvements to our common life. No change comes easy; as Cordova points ou t \"everything wishes to remain what it is\". The creation of form is balanced in the sephira Gevurah by the preservation and destruc tion of form. Any impulse of change is channelled through Gevurah , and if it is not resisted then something will be destroyed. If you want to make paper you cut down a tree. If you want to ab olish slavery you have to destroy the culture which perpetuates i t. If you want to change someone's mind you have to destroy that person's beliefs about the matter in question. The sephira Gevurah is the quality of strict judgement which opposes change, destroys the unfamiliar, and corresponds in many ways to an immune system within the body of God. There has to be a balance between creation and destruction. Too much change, too many ideas, too many things happening too quickly can have the quality of chaos (and can lit erally become that), whereas too little change, no new ideas, too much form and"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"structure and protocol can suffocate and stifle. T here has to be a balance which \"makes sense\" and this \"idea of balance\" or \"making sense\" is expressed in the sephira Tiphere th. It is an instinctive morality, and it isn't present by de fault in the human species. It isn't based on cultural norms; i t doesn't have its roots in upbringing (although it is easily dest royed by it). Some people have it in a large measure, and some p eople are (to all intents and purposes) completely lacking in it . It doesn't necessarily respect conventional morality: it may laugh in its face. I can't say what it is in any detail, b ecause it is peculiar and individual, but those who have it ha ve a natural quality of integrity, soundness of judgement, a n instinctive sense of rightness, justice and compassion, and a willingness to fight or suffer in defense of that sense of justice . Tiphereth is a paradoxical sephira because in many people it i s simply not there. It can be developed, and that is one of the goals of initiation, but for many people Tiphereth is a roo m with nothing in it. Having passed through Gevurah on the Pillar of Form, and found its way through the moral filter of Tiphereth , a creative impulse picks up energy once more on the Pillar of Force via the Sephira Netzach, where the energy of \"becoming\" fi nds its final expression in the form of \"vital urges\". Why do we carry on living? Why bother? What is it that compels us to do things? An artist may have a vision of a piece of art, but what actually compels the artist to paint or sculpt or write? Why do we want to compete and win? Why do we care what happens to others? The sephira Netzach expresses the basic vital creativ e urges in a form we can recognise as drives, feelings and emot ions. Netzach is pre-verbal; ask a child why he wants a toy and t he answer will be \"I just do\". \"But why,\" you ask, wondering why he doesn't want the much more \"sensible\" toy you had in mind. \"Why don't y ou want this one here.\" \"I just don't. I want this one.\" \"But what's so good about that one.\" \"I don't know what to say...I just like it.\" This conversation is not fictitious and is qu intessentially Netzach. The structure of the Tree of Life posits that the basic driving forces which characterise our behaviour a re pre-verbal and non-rational; anyone who has tried to change an other person's basic nature or beliefs through force of rational argument will know this. After Netzach we go to the sephira Hod to pic k up our last cargo of Form. Ask a child why they want something and they say \"I just do\". Press an adult and you will get an earful of \"reasons\". We live in a culture where it is imp ortant (often essential) to give reasons for the things we do, a nd Hod is the sephira of form where it is possible to give shape to our wants in terms of reasons and explanations. Hod is th e sephira of abstraction, reason, logic, language and communi cation, and a reflection of the Mother of Form in the human mind . We have a innate capacity to abstract, to go immediate ly from the particular to the general, and we have an innate capacity to communicate these abstractions using language, and it should be clear why the alternative translation of Binah is"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"\"intelligence\"; Binah is the \"intelligence of G od\", and Hod underpins what we generally recognise as intelligen ce in people - the ability to grasp complex abstractions, reason a bout them, and articulate this understanding using some means of c ommunication. The synthesis of Hod and Netzach on th e Pillar of Consciousness is the sephira Yesod. Yesod is th e sephira of interface, and the comparison with computer periphe ral interfaces is an excellent one. Yesod is sometimes called \"the Receptacle of the Emanations\", and it interfaces the emanations of all three pillars to the sephira Malkuth, and it is through Yesod that the final abstract form of something is realised in mat ter. Form in Yesod is no longer abstract; it is explicit, but not yet individual - that last quality is reserved for M alkuth alone. Yesod is like the mold in a bottle factory - th e mold is a realisation of the abstract idea \"bottle\" in s o far as it expresses the shape of a particular bottle des ign in every detail, but it is not itself an individual bottle. The final step in the process is the sephira M alkuth, where God becomes flesh, and every abstract form is realised in actuality, in the \"real world\". There is much to s ay about this, but I will keep it for later. The process I have described is called the Lig htning Flash. The Lightning Flash runs as follows: Kether, Cho khmah, Binah, Chesed, Gevurah, Tiphereth, Netzach, Hod, Yesod, M alkuth, and if you trace the Lighning Flash on a diagram of the T ree you will see that it has the zig-zag shape of a lightnin g flash. The sephiroth are numbered according to their order on the lightning flash: Kether is 1, Chokhmah is 2, and so on. The \"Sepher Yetzirah\" [2] has this to say about the sephiroth: \"When you think of the ten sephiroth cover yo ur heart and seal the desire of your lips to announce th eir divinity. Yoke your mind. Should it escape your grasp, reach out and bring it back under your control. As it was s aid, 'And the living creatures ran and returned as the app earance of a flash of lightning,' in such a manner was the Covenant created.\" The quotation within the quotation comes from Eze kiel 1.14, a text which inspired a large amount of early Kabbalistic speculation, and it is probable that the Lightn ing Flash as described is one of the earliest components of the idea of sephirothic emanation. The Lightning Flash describes the creat ive process, beginning with the unknown, unmanifest hidden God, and follows it through ten distinct stages to a change in the mate rial world. It can be used to describe *any* change - lighting a m atch, picking your nose, walking the dog - and novices are usu ally set the exercise of analysing any arbitrarily chosen even t in terms of the Lightning Flash. Because the Lightning Flash c an be used to understand the inner process whereby the material world of the senses changes and evolves, it is a key to prac tical magical work, and because it is intended to account for *a ll* change it follows that all change is equally magical, and th e word \"magic\" is essentially meaningless (but nevertheless useful for distinguishing between \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" states of consciousness, and the modes of causality which per tain to each)."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" It also follows that the key to understanding our \"spiritual nature\" does not belong in the spiritual empyre an, where it remains inaccessible, but in *all* the routine a nd unexciting little things in life. Everything is is equally \"spiritual\", equally \"divine\", and there is more to be learned from picking one's nose than there is in a spiritual discipline which puts you \"here\" and God \"over there\". The Lightning Flash en ds in Malkuth, and it can be followed like a thread through the hi dden pathways of creation until one arrives back at the sour ce. The next chapter will retrace the Lightning Flash by examining the qualities of each sephira in more detail.

Malkuth ------- Malkuth is the Cinderella of the sephiroth . It is the sephira most often ignored by beginners, the sephi ra most often glossed over in Kabbalistic texts, and it is not only the most immediate of the sephira but it is also the most co mplex, and for sheer inscrutability it rivals Kether - indeed, there is a Kabbalistic aphorism that \"Kether is Malkuth, and Malkuth is in Kether, but after another manner\". The word Malkuth means \"Kingdom\", and the se phira is the culmination of a process of emanation whereby the c reative power of the Godhead is progressively structured and d efined as it moves down the Tree and arrives in a completed for m in Malkuth. Malkuth is the sphere of matter, substance, the real, physical world. In the least compromising versions of materialist philosophy (e.g. Hobbes) there is nothing beyond ph ysical matter, and from that viewpoint the Tree of Life beyond Mal kuth does not exist: our feelings of identity and self-cons ciousness are nothing more than a by-product of chemical reac tions in the brain, and the mind is a complex automata which su ffers from the disease of metaphysical delusions. Kabbalah is *not* a materialist model of reality, but when we examin e Malkuth by itself we find ourselves immersed in matter, and it is natural to think in terms of physics, chemistry and molecula r biology. The natural sciences provide the most accurate models of matter and the physical world that we have, and it would be f oolishness of the first order to imagine that Kabbalah can p rovide better explanations of the nature of matter on the basis of a study of the text of the Old Testament. Not that I u nder-rate the intuition which has gone into the making of Kabba lah over the centuries, but for practical purposes the avera ge university"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"science graduate knows (much) more about the mater ial stuff of the world than medieval Kabbalists, and a groundi ng in modern physics is as good a way to approach Malkuth as any other. For those who are not comfortable with physi cs there are alternative, more traditional ways of approaching Malkuth. The magical image of Malkuth is that of a young woman crowned and throned. The woman is Malkah, the Queen, Kallah, the Bride. She is the inferior mother, a reflection and realis ation of the superior mother Binah. She is the Queen who inhabit s the Kingdom, and the Bride of the Microprosopus. She is Gaia, Mother Earth, but of course she is not only the substance of this world; she is the body of the entire physical universe. Some care is required when assigning Mother/Ea rth goddesses to Malkuth, because some of them correspond more c losely to the superior mother Binah. There is a close and de ep connection between Malkuth and Binah which results in the two sephiroth sharing similar correspondences, and one of the oldest Kabbalistic texts [1] has this to say about Malkuth : \"The title of the tenth path [Malkuth] is th e Resplendent Intelligence. It is called this because it is exalted above every head from where it sits upon the throne of Binah. It illuminates the numinosity of all lights a nd causes to emanate the Power of the archetype of co untenances or forms.\" One of the titles of Binah is Khorsia, or Throne, and the image which this text provides is that Binah provides the framework upon which Malkuth sits. We will return to this later. Binah contains the potential of form in the abstract, wh ile Malkuth is is the fullest realisation of form, and both sephi roth share the correspondences of heaviness, limitation, finiten ess, inertia, avarice, silence, and death. The female quality of Malkuth is often identi fied with the Shekhinah, the female spirit of God in the creation, and Kabbalistic literature makes much of the (carnal) r elationship of God and the Shekhinah. Waite [7] mentions that the relationship between God and Shekhinah is mirrored in the relati onship between man and woman, and provides a great deal of inform ation on both the Shekhinah and what he quaintly calls \"The Myst ery of Sex\". After the exile of the Jews from Spain in 149 2, Kabbalists identified their own plight with the fate of the S hekhinah, and she is pictured as being cast out into matter in m uch the same way as the Gnostics pictured Sophia, the outcast d ivine wisdom. The doctrine of the Shekhinah within Kabbalah and w ithin Judaism as a whole is complex and it is something I don't f eel competent to comment further on; more information can be fo und in [3] & [7]. Malkuth is the sphere of the physical elements and Kabbalists still use the four-fold scheme which d ates back at least as far as Empedocles and probably the A rk. The four elements correspond to four readily-observable stat es of matter: solid - earth liquid - water gas - air plasma - fire/electric arc (li ghtning)"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" In addition it is not uncommon to include a fift h element so rarified and arcane that most people (self include d) are pushed to say what it is; the fifth element is aethyr (or ether) and is sometimes called spirit. The amount of material written about the elements is enormous, and rather than reproduce in bulk what is relatively well-known I will provide a rough outline so that those readers who aren't familiar with Kabbalah will realise I am talking about approximately the same thing as they have seen befo re. A detailed description of the traditional medieval view of the four elements can be found in \"The Magus\" [2].

The elements in Malkuth are arranged as follow s:  South  Fire East Zenith Aethyr+ West Air Nadir Aethyr- Water  North  Earth I have rotated the cardinal points through 180 degr ees from their customary directions so that it is easier to see ho w the elements fit on the lower face of the Tree of Life:  Tiphereth  Fire Hod Yesod Netzach Air Aethyr Water"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"  Malkuth  Earth It is important to distinguish between the element s in Malkuth, where we are talking about real substance (the w ater in your body, the breath in your lungs), and the elements on the Tree, where we are using traditional correspondences *ass ociated* with the elements, e.g.: Earth: solid, stable, practical, down-to-earth Water: sensitive, intuitive, emotional, caring , fertile Air: vocal, communicative, intellectual Fire: energetic, daring, impetuous Positive Aethyr: glue, binding, plastic Negative Aethyr: unbinding, dissolution, disin tegration Aethyr or Spirit is enigmatic, and I tend to think of it in terms of the forces which bind matter together. It is al most certainly a coincidence (but nevertheless interesting) that t here are four fundamental forces - gravitational, electromagnetic , weak nuclear & strong nuclear - known to date, and current belie f is that they can be unified into one fundamental force. On a slightly more arcane tack, Barret [2] has this to say about Aethy r: \"Now seeing that the soul is the ess ential form, intelligible and uncorruptible, and is the f irst mover of the body, and is moved itself; but that the bo dy, or matter, is of itself unable and unfit for motion, and does very much degenerate from the soul, it appears that ther e is a need of a more excellent medium:- now such a medium is conceived to be the spirit of the world, or that which some call a quintessence; because it is not from the four elements, but a certain first thing, having its being abov e and beside them. There is, therefore, such a kind of medi um required to be, by which celestial souls [e.g. forms] ma y be joined to gross bodies, and bestow upon them wonderful gifts. This spirit is in the same manner, in the body of the world, as our spirit is in our bodies; for as the power s of our soul are communicated to the members of the body by the medium of the spirit, so also the virtue of the soul of the world is diffused, throughout all things, by the m edium of the universal spirit; for there is nothing to be found in the whole world that hath not a spark of the virtu e thereof.\" Aethyr underpins the elements like a foundat ion and its attribution to Yesod should be obvious, particular ly as it forms the linking role between the ideoplastic world of \"the Astral Light\" [8] and the material world. Aethyr is ofte n thought to"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"come in two flavours - positive Aethyr, which binds , and negative Aethyr, which unbinds. Negative Aethyr is a bit like the Universal Solvent, and requires as much care in han dling ;-} Working with the physical elements in Malkuth is one of the most important areas of applied magic, dealing as it does with the basic constituents of the real world. The phys ical elements are tangible and can be experience in a very direc t way through recreations such as caving, diving, parachuting o r firewalking; they bite back in a suitably humbling way, and the y provide CMs with an opportunity to join the neo-pagans in the g reat outdoors. Our bodies themselves are made from physical stuff, and there are many Raja Yoga-like exercises which can be carried out using the elements as a basis for work on the body. If you can stand his manic intensity (Exercise 1: boil an egg by force of will) then Bardon [9] is full of good ideas. Malkuth is often associated with various kinds of intrinsic evil, and to understand this attitude (which I do not share) it is necessary to confront the same question as thirt eenth century Kabbalists: can God be evil? The answer to this question was (broadly speaking) \"yes\", but Kabbalists have gone through many strange gyrations in an attempt to avoid what was for many an unacceptable conclusion. It was difficult to accep t that famine, war, disease, prejudice, hate, death could be a par t of a perfect being, and there had to be some way to account for evil which did not contaminate divine perfection. One approach was to sweep evil under the carpet, and in this case the carpet was Malkuth. Malkuth became the habitation for evil spirits. If one examines the structure of the Tree with out prejudice then it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that evil is quite adequately accounted for, and there is no need to shuffle evil to the periphery of the Tree like a cleaner withou t a dustpan. The emanation of any sephirah from Chokhmah downwards can manifest as good or evil depending on circumstances and the point of view of those affected by the energy involved. T his appears to have been understood even at the time of the wr iting of the \"Zohar\", where the mercy of God is constantly contr asted with the severity of God, and the author makes it clear th at one has to balance the other - you cannot have the mercy without the severity. On the other hand, the severity of God i s persistently identified with the rigours of existence (form , finiteness, limitation), and while it is true that many of the things which have been identified with evil are a consequ ence of the finiteness of things, of being finite beings in a w orld of finite resources governed by natural laws with inflexible causality, it not correct to infer (as some have) that fo rm itself is *intrinsically* evil. The notion that form and matter are *intrinsic ally* evil, or in some way imperfect or not a part of God, may have reached Kabbalah from a number of sources. Scholem com ments: \"The Kabbalah of the early thirteenth cen tury was the offspring of a union between an older an d essentially Gnostic tradition represented by the book \"Bah ir\", and the comparatively modern element of Jewish Neo-Pla tonism.\" There is the possibility that the Kabbalists of Provence (who wrote or edited the \"Sepher Bahir\") were influ enced by the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Cathars, a late form of Manicheanism. Whether th e source was Gnosticism, Neo-Platonism, Manicheanism or some c ombination of all three, Kabbalah has imported a view of matter and form which distorts the view of things portrayed by the Tree o f Life, and so Malkuth ends up as a kind of cosmic outer darkness, a bin for all the dirt, detritus, broken sephira and dirty ha nkies of the creation. Form is evil, the Mother of Form is fem ale, women are definitely and indubitably evil, and Malkuth is th e most female of the sephira, therefore Malkuth is most definite ly evil...quod erat demonstrandum. By the time we reach the time o f S.L. Mathers and the Golden Dawn there is a complete Tree of evil demonic Qlippoth *underneath* Malkuth as a relection of th e \"good\" Tree above it. I believe this may have something to do with the fact that meditations on Malkuth can easily become m editations on Binah, and meditations on Binah have a habit of sli pping into the Abyss, and once in the Abyss it is easy to trawl u p enough junk to \"discover\" an averse Tree \"underneath\" Malkuth. This view of the Qlippoth, or Shells, as active, demonic evi l has become pervasive, and the more energy people put into the demonic Tree, the less there is for the original. Abolish the Qlippoth as demonic forces, and the Tree of Life comes alive with its full power of good *and* evil. The following quotation from Bischoff [10] (speaking of the Sephiroth) provides a more ra tional view of the Qlippoth: \"Since their energy [of the sephiroth] shows three degrees of strength (highest, middle and lowest d egree), their emanations group accordingly in sequence. We u sually imagine the image of a descending staircase. T he Kabbalist prefers to see this fact as a decreasing alie nation of the central primeval energy. Consequently any less perfect emanation is to him the cover or shell (Qli ppah) of the preceeding, and so the last (furthest) emanat ions being the so-called material things are the shell of the total and are therefore called (in the actual sense) Qlippot h.\" This is my own view; the shell of something is the accretion of form which it accumulates as energy comes down the Lightning Flash. If the shell can be considered by itself the n it is a dead husk of something which could be alive - it prese rves all the structure but there is no energy in it to bring it alive. With this interpretation the Qlippoth are to be found e verywhere: in relationships, at work, at play, in ritual, in soc iety. Whenever something dies and people refuse to recognise that it is dead, and cling to the lifeless husk of whatever it was, then you get a Qlippah. For this reason one of the vices of Malku th is Avarice, not only in the sense of trying to acquire material things, but also in the sense of being unwilling to let go of anything, even when it has become dead and worthless. The Qlippah of Malkuth is what you would get if the Sun went out: Stasis, li fe frozen into immobility. The other vice of Malkuth is Inertia, in the sense of \"active resistance to motion; sluggish; disinclin ed to move or act\". It is visible in most people at one time or another, and tends to manifest when a task is new, necess ary, but not particularly exciting, there is no excitement or \"n atural energy\" to keep one fired up, and one has to keep on pushin g right to the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"finish. For this reason the obligation of Mal kuth is (has to be) self-discipline. The virtue of Malkuth is Discrimination, th e ability to perceive differences. The ability to perceive dif ferences is a necessity for any living organism, whether a bact eria able to sense the gradient of a nutrient or a kid working out how much money to wheedle out of his parents. As Malkuth is the final realisation of form, it is the sphere where ou r ability to distinguish between differences is most pronounced. The capacity to discriminate is so fundamental to survival t hat it works overtime and finds boundaries and distinctions ever ywhere - \"you\" and \"me\", \"yours\" and \"mine\", distinctions of \" property\" and \"value\" and \"territory\" which are intellectual ab stractions on one level (i.e. not real) and fiercely defended realities on another (i.e. very real indeed). I am not going to attempt a definition of real and unreal, but it is the case that much of what we think of as real is unreal, and much of wh at we think of as unreal is real, and we need the same discrim ination which leads us into the mire to lead us out again. Some people think skin colour is a real measure of intelligence; som e don't. Some people think gender is a real measure of ability; some don't. Some people judge on appearances; some don't. Ther e is clearly a difference between a bottle of beer and a bottle of piss, but is the colour of the *bottle* important? What *is* im portant? What differences are real, what matters? How much energ y do we devote to things which are \"not real\". Am I able to perce ive how much I am being manipulated by a fixation on unreality? A re my goals in life \"real\", or will they look increasingly silly and immature as I grow older? For that matter, is Kabbalah \"re al\"? Does it provide a useful model of reality, or is it the remnant of a world-view which should have been put to rest centu ries ago? One of the primary exercises of an initiate into Malkuth is a thorough examination of the question \"What is real? \". The Spiritual Experience of Malkuth is v ariously the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Ang el (HGA), or the Vision of the HGA (depending on who you believe ). I vote for the Vision of the HGA in Malkuth, and the Knowledge and Conversation in Tiphereth. What is the HGA? Acco rding to the Gnosticism of Valentinus each person has a guardi an angel who accompanies that individual throught their life an d reveals the gnosis; the angel is in a sense the divine Self. This belief is identical to what I was taught by the person w ho taught me Kabbalah, so some part of Gnosticism lives on. The current tradition concerning the HGA almost certainly enter ed the Western Esoteric Tradition as a consequence of S.L. Mather 's translation [11] of \"The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abrameli n the Mage\", which contains full details of a lengthy ritual t o attain the Knowledge and Conversation of the HGA. This ritua l has had an important influence on twentieth century magician s and it is often attempted and occasionally completed. The powers of Malkuth are invoked by means of the names Adonai ha Aretz and Adonai Melekh, which mean \"Lord of the World\" and \"The Lord who is King\" respectively. The power is transmitted through the world of Creation by the archangel Sand alphon, who is sometimes referred to as \"the Long Angel\", because his feet are in Malkuth and his head in Kether, which gives him an opportunity to chat to Metatron, the Angel of the Presence. T he angel order"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"is the Ashim, or Ishim, sometimes translated as the \"souls of fire\", supposedly the souls of righteous men and wo men. In concluding this section on Malkuth, it worth em phasising that I have chosen deliberately not to explore some major topics because there are sufficient threads for anyone wit h an interest to pick up and follow for themselves. The image o f Malkuth as Mother Earth provides a link between Kabbalah an d a numinous archetype with a deep significance for some. The im age of Malkuth as physical substance provides a link into the scie nces, and it is the case that at the limits of theoretical physics one's intuitions seem to be slipping and sliding on the s ame reality as in Kabbalah. The image of Malkuth as the sphere of the elements is the key to a large body of practical magical te chnique which varies from yoga-like concentration on the bodily elements, to nature-oriented work in the great outdoors. Lastly , just as the design of a building reveals much about its builder s, so Malkuth can reveal a great deal about Kether - the bottom o f the Tree and the top have much in common.

Yesod ----- Yesod means \"foundation\", and that is what Ye sod is: it is the hidden infrastructure whereby the emanatio ns from the remainder of the Tree are transmitted to the sep hira Malkuth. Just as a large building has its air-conditioning d ucts, service tunnels, conduits, electrical wiring, hot and col d water pipes, attic spaces, lift shafts, winding rooms, stor age tanks, a"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"telephone exchange etc, so does the Creation, and the external, visible world of phenomenal reality rests ( metaphorically speaking) upon a hidden foundation of occul t machinery. Meditations on the nature of Yesod tend to be fu ll of secret tunnels and concealed mechanisms, as if the Creatio n was a Gothic mansion with a secret door behind every mirror, a passage in every wall, a pair of hidden eyes behind every por trait, and a subterranean world of forgotten tunnels leading who knows where. For this reason the Spiritual Experience of Yesod i s aptly named \"The Vision of the Machinery of the Universe\". Many Yesod correspondences reinforce this notion of a foundation, of something which lies behind, suppo rts and gives shape to phenomenal reality. The magical image of Yesod is of \"a beautiful naked man, very strong\". The image whi ch springs to mind is that of a man with the world resting on h is shoulders, like one of the misrepresentations of the Tita n Atlas (who actually held up the heavens, not the world). The angel order of Yesod is the Cherubim, the Strong Ones, the archang el is Gabriel, the Strong or Mighty One of God, and the God-name is Shaddai el Chai, the Almighty Living God. The idea of a foundation suggests that there i s a substance which lies behind physical matter and \"in-forms it\" or \"holds it together\", something less structured, more plastic , more refined and rarified, and this \"fifth element\" is often ca lled aethyr. I will not attempt to justify aethyr in terms of cu rrent physics (the closest concept I have found is the hypot hesised Higgs field); it is a convenient handle on a concept whic h has enormous intuitive appeal to many magicians, who, when as ked how magic works, tend to think in terms of a medium which is directly receptive to the will, something which is plasti c and can be shaped through concentration and imagination, and w hich transmits their artificially created forms into reality. Eliphas Levi called this medium the \"Astral Light\". It is als o natural to imagine that mind, consciousness, and the sou l have their habitation in this substance, and there are volumes detailing the properties of the \"Etheric Body\", the \"Astral Body \", the \"Causal Body\" [1,2] and so on. I don't take this stuff too seriously, but I do like to work with the kind of natural intuitio ns which occur spontaneously and independently in a large number of people - there is power in these intuitions - and it is a mistake to invalidate them because they sound cranky. When I talk about aethyr or the Astral Light, I mean there is a n ideoplastic substance which is subjectively real to many m agicians, and explanations of magic at the level of Yesod r evolve around manipulating this substance using desire, imaginati on and will. The fundamental nature of Yesod is that of *i nterface*; it interfaces the rest of the Tree of Life to Malkuth. The interface is bi-directional; there are impulses coming down from Kether, and echoes bouncing back from Malkuth. The idea of interface is illustrated in the design of a computer system: a c omputer with a multitude of worlds hidden within it is a source of heat and repair bills unless it has peripheral interface s and device drivers to interface the world outside the computer to the world \"inside\" it; add a keyboard and a mouse and a m onitor and a printer and you have opened the door into another reality. Our own senses have the same characteristic of being a bi-directional interface through which we experience the world, and for this"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"reason the senses correspond to Yesod, and not o nly the five traditional senses - the \"sixth sense\" and the \"sec ond sight\" are given equal status, and so Yesod is also t he sphere of instinctive psychism, of clairvoyance, precogniti on, divination and prophecy. It is also clear from accounts of l ucid dreaming (and personal experience) that we possess the abili ty to perceive an inner world as vividly as the outer, and so to Yesod belongs the inner world of dreams, daydreams and vivid ima gination, and one of the titles of Yesod is \"The Treasure House of Images\". To Yesod is attributed Levanah, the Moon, a nd the lunar associations of tides, flux and change, occult i nfluence, and deeply instinctive and sometimes atavistic behaviour - possession, mediumship, lycanthropy and the l ike. Although Yesod is the foundation and it has associations wit h strength, it is by no means a rigid scaffold supporting a worl d in stasis. Yesod supports the world just as the sea supports all the life which lives in it and sails upon it, and just as t he sea has its irresistable currents and tides, so does Yesod. Yes od is the most \"occult\" of the sephiroth, and next to Malkuth it is the most magical, but compared with Malkuth its magic is of a more subtle, seductive, glamorous and ensnaring kind. Magician s are drawn to Yesod by the idea that if reality rests on a hidde n foundation, then by changing the foundation it is possible t o change the reality. The magic of Yesod is the magic of form a nd appearance, not substance; it is the magic of illusi on, glamour, transformation, and shape-changing. The most sophisticated examples of this are to be found in modern marketin g, advertising and image consultancies. I do not jest. My tongu e is not even slightly in my cheek. The following quote was tak en from this morning's paper [3]: Although the changes look cosmetic, those re sponsible for creating corporate image argue that a re design of a company's uniform or name is just the visible sign of a much larger transformation. \"The majority of people continue to misunderst and and think that it is just a logo, rather than understa nding that a corporate identity programme is actually conce rned with the very commercial objective of having a strong p ersonality and single-minded, focussed direction for the whole organisation, \" said Fiona Gilmore, managing d irector of the design company Lewis Moberly. \"It's like plan ting an acorn and then a tree grows. If you create the righ t *foundation* (my itals) then you are building a whole cul ture for the future of an organisation.\" I don't know what Ms. Gilmore studies in her spare time, but the idea that it is possible to manipulate reality by manipulating symbols and appearances is entirely magical. The s ame article on corporate identity continues as follows: \"The scale of the BT relaunch is colossal. The new logo will be painted on more than 72,000 vehicles and trailers, as well as 9,000 properties. The company's 92,000 public payphones will ge t new decals, and its 90 shops will have to changed, right down to the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" yellow door handles. More than 50,000 employe es are likely to need new uniforms or \"image clothing\". Note the emphasis on *image*. The company in ques tion (British Telecom) is an ex-public monopoly with an appal ling customer relations problem, so it is changing the co lour of its door handles! This is Yesodic magic on a gigantic s cale. The image manipulators gain most of their po wer from the mass-media. The mass-media correspond to two sep hiroth: as a medium of communication they belong in Hod, but as a foundation for our perception of reality they belong in Yesod. Nowadays most people form their model of what the world (in the l arge) is like via the media. There are a few individuals who tra vel the world sufficiently to have a model based on personal ex perience, but for most people their model of what most of the wor ld is like is formed by newspapers, radio and television; that is, the media have become an extended (if inaccurate) instrument of perception. Like our \"normal\" means of perception the medi a are highly selective in the variety and content of information provided, and they can be used by advertising agencies and other manipulative individuals to create foundations for new collectiv e realities. While on the subject of changing perception to assemble new realities, the following quote by \"Don Juan\" [4] h as a definite Kabbalistic flavour: \"The next truth is that perception takes place ,\" he went on, \"because there is in each of us an agen t called the assemblage point that selects internal and external emanations for alignment. The particular alig nment that we perceive as the world is the product of a specific spot where our assemblage point is located on our c ocoon.\" One of the titles of Yesod is \"The Receptacle of th e Emanations\", and its function is precisely as described above - Yesod is the assemblage point which assembles the emanations of the internal and the external. In addition to the deliberate, magical ma nipulation of foundations, there are other important areas of mag ic relevant to Yesod. Raw, innate psychism is an ability which te nds to improve as more attention is devoted to creative visualisat ion, focussed meditation (on Tarot cards for example), dreams (e .g. keeping a dream diary), and divination. Divination is an important technique to practice even if you feel you are te rrible at it (and especially if you think it is nonsense) , because it reinforces the idea that it is permissible to \"let go\" and intuite meanings into any pattern. Many people ha ve difficulty doing this, feeling perhaps that they will be swamped with unreason (recalling Freud's fear, expressed to Jung , of needing a bulwark against the \"black mud of occultism\"), wh en in reality their minds are swamped with reason and could use a holiday. Any divination system can be used, but systems which e mphasise pure intuition are best (e.g. Tarot, runes, tea-leave s, flights of birds, patterns on the wallpaper, smoke. I heard of a Kabbalist who threw a cushion into the air and carried out divination on the basis of the number of pieces of foam stuffin g which fell out). Because Yesod is a kind of aethyric refle ction of the physical world, the image of and precursor to rea lity, mirrors"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"are an important tool for Yesod magic. Quartz crys tals are also used, probably because of the use of crysta l balls for divination, but also because quartz crystal and am ethyst have a peculiarly Yesodic quality in their own right. Th e average New Age shop filled with crystals, Tarot cards, silver jewelry (lunar association), perfumes, dreamy music, and all the glitz, glamour and glitter of a daemonic magpie's nest, is like a temple to Yesod. Mirrors and crystals are used passively as focii for receptivity, but they can also be used actively for certain kinds of aethyric magic - there is an interesting book o n making and using magic mirrors which builds on the kind of ele mental magical work carried out in Malkuth [5]. Yesod has an important correspondence wit h the sexual organs. The correspondence occurs in three ways. Th e first way is that when the Tree of Life is placed over the human body, Yesod is positioned over the genitals. The author of the Zohar is quite explicit about \"the remaining members of the Micro prosopus\", to the extent that the relevant paragraphs in Mather' s translation of \"The Lesser Holy Assembly\" remain in Latin to av oid offending Victorian sensibilities. The second association of Yesod with the ge nitals arises from the union of the Microprosopus and his Br ide. This is another recurring theme in Kabbalah, and the symbol ism is complex and refers to several distinct ideas, from the relationship between man and wife to an internal process within the body of God: e.g [6]. \"When the Male is joined with the Femal e, they both constitute one complete body, and all the Uni verse is in a state of happiness, because all things receive blessing from their perfect body. And this is an Arcanum.\" or, referring to the Bride: \"And she is mitigated, and receiveth blessing in that place which is called the Holy of Holies below.\" or, referring to the \"member\": \"And that which floweth down into that place where it is congregated, and which is emitted through th at most holy Yesod, Foundation, is entirely white, and t herefore is it called Chesed. Thence Chesed entereth into the Holy of Holie s; as it is written Ps. cxxxiii. 3 'For there Tetragramm aton commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.'\" It is not difficult to read a great deal into pa ragraphs like this, and there are many more in a similar vein. Suffice to say that the Microprosopus is often identified with the sephira Tiphereth, the Bride is the sephira Malkuth, and the point of union between them is obviously Yesod. The third and more abstract association betwe en Yesod and the sexual organs arises because the sexual o rgans are a mechanism for perpetuating the *form* of a living organism. In order to get close to what is happening in sexual r eproduction it is worth asking the question \"What is a computer pr ogram?\". Well,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"a computer program indisputably begins as an idea; it is not a material thing. It can be written down in various ways; as an abstract specification in set theoretic notation akin to pure mathematics, or as a set of recursive functio ns in lambda calculus; it could be written in several differen t high level languages - Pascal, C, Prolog, LISP, ADA, ML etc . Are they all they same program? Computer scientists wrestle with this problem: can we show that two different programs written in two different languages are in some sense functionally identic al? It isn't trivial to do this because it asks fundamental qu estions about language (any language) and meaning, but it is possible in limited cases to produce two apparently diffe rent programs written in different languages and assert th at they are identical. Whatever the program is, it see ms to exist independently of any particular language, so what is the program and where is it? Let us ignore that chestnut and go on to the next level. Suppose we write the program down. W e could do it with a pencil. We could punch holes in paper. We could plant trees in a pattern in a field. We can line up magn etic domains. We can burn holes in metal foil. I could have it t attooed on my back. We can transform it into radically different forms (that is what compilers and assemblers do). It obviously isn 't tied to any physical representation either. What about the com puter it runs on? Well, it could be a conventional one made wi th CMOS chips etc.....but aren't there a lot of different kinds and makes of computer, and they can all run the same program. It is also quite practical to build computers which *don't* use ele ctrons - you could use mechanics or fluids or ball bearings - al l you need to do is produce something with the functionality of a Turing machine, and that isn't hard. So not only is the pr ogram not tied to any particular physical representation, but the same goes for the computer itself, and what we are left with is two puffs of smoke. On another level this is crazy; computers are real, they do real things in the real world, and the program s which make them work are obviously real too....aren't they? Now apply the same kind of scrutiny to living organisms, and the mechanism of reproduction. Take a good look at nucleic acids, enzymes, proteins etc., and ask the same kind of q uestions. I am not implying that life is a sort of program, bu t what I am suggesting is that if you try to get close to what constitutes a living organism you end up with another puff of smoke and a handful of atoms which could just as well be bal l-bearings or fluids or....The thing that is being perpetuated t hrough sexual reproduction is something quite abstract and immate rial; it is an abstract form preserved and encoded in a particula r pattern of chemicals, and if I was asked which was more real, the transient collection of chemicals used, or the abstract fo rm itself, I would answer \"the form\". But then, I am a programme r, and I would say that. I find it astonishing that there are a ny hard-core materialists left in the world. All the important stuff seems to exist at the level of puffs of smoke, what Kabbali sts call form. Roger Penrose, one of the most eminent mathematici ans living has this to say [7]: \"I have made no secret of the fact that my s ympathies lie strongly with the Platonic view that mathemat ical truth is"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" absolute, external and eternal, and not base d on man-made criteria; and that mathematical objects hav e a timeless existence of their own, not dependent on huma n society nor on particular physical objects.\" \"Ah Ha!\" cry the materialists, \"At least th e atoms are real.\" Well, they are until you start pulling the m apart with tweezers and end up with a heap of equations which turn out to be the linguistic expression of an idea. As Einstein s aid, \"The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible\", that is, capable of being descr ibed in some linguistic form. I am not trying to convince anyone of the \"rig htness\" of the Kabbalistic viewpoint. What I am trying to do is show that the process whereby form is impressed on matter (the relationship between Yesod and Malkuth) is not arcane, theoso phical mumbo- jumbo; it is an issue which is alive and kicking, and the closer we get to \"real things\" (and that certainly in cludes living organisms), the better the Kabbalistic model (that form precedes manifestation, that there is a well-defined process of form-ation with the \"real world\" as an outcome) looks. The illusion of Yesod is security, the kind of s ecurity which forms the foundation of our personal existence in t he world. On a superficial level our security is built out of rel ationships, a source of income, a place to live, a vocation, pers onal power and influence etc, but at a deeper level the foundatio n of personal identity is built on a series of accidents, e ncounters and influences which create the illusion of who we are, what we believe in, and what we stand for. There is a warm, secure feeling of knowing what is right and wrong, of do ing the right thing, of living a worthwhile life in the service of worthwhile causes, of having a uniquely privileged vantage po int from which to survey the problems of life (with all the in tolerance and incomprehension of other people which accompanies t his insight), and conversely there are feelings of despair, depre ssion, loss of identity, and existential terror when a crack forms in the illusion, and reality shows through - Castaneda c alls it \"the crack in the world\". The smug, self-perpetuating illusion which masquerades as personal identity at the level of Yesod is the most astoundingly difficult thing to shift or destr oy. It fights back with all the resources of the personali ty, it will enthusiastically embrace any ally which will help t o shore up its defenses - religious, political or scientif ic ideology; psychological, sociological, metaphysical and theosophical claptrap (e.g. Kabbalah); the law and popular mora lity; in fact, any beliefs which give it the power to retain its identity, uniqueness and integrity. Because this parasite of the soul uses religion (and its esoteric offshoots) to sustain it self they have little or no power over it and become a major part of the problem. There are various ways of overcoming this p ersonal demon (Carroll [8], in an essay on the subject, calls i t Choronzon), and the two I know best are the cataclysmic and the abrasive. The first method involves a shock so extreme that it is impossible to be the same person again, and if enough preparat ion has gone before then it is possible to use the shock to reb uild oneself."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"In some cases this doesn't happen; I have notic ed that many people with very rigid religious beliefs talk r eadily about having suffered traumatic experiences, and the phenomenon of hysterical conversion among soldiers suffering from war neuroses is well known. The other method, the abrasive, i s to wear away the demon of self-importance, to grind it into not hing by doing (for example) something for someone else for which one receives no thanks, praise, reward, or recognition. The task has to be big enough and awful enough to become a demon in its o wn right and induce all the correct feelings of compulsion (I have to do this), helplessness (I'll never make it), indign ation (what's the point, it's not my problem anyway), rebellion (I won't, I won't, not anymore), more compulsion (I can't give up), self-pity (how did I get into this?), exhaustion (Oh No! Not again!), despair (I can't go on), and finally a kind of su bmission when one's demon hasn't the energy to put up a struggle any more and simply gives up. The woman who taught me Kabbalah used both the cataclysmic and the abrasive methods on her students with malicious glee - I will discuss this in more d etail in the section on Tiphereth. The virtue of Yesod is independence, the abili ty to make our own foundations, to continually rebuild ourselves, to reject the security of comfortable illusions and confront re ality without blinking. The vice of Yesod is idleness. This can be co ntrasted with the inertia of Malkuth. A stone is inert because it lacks the capacity to change, but in most circumstances peop le can change and can't be bothered. At least, not today. Yesod has a dreamy, illusory, comfortable, *seductive* quality, as in t he Isle of the Lotus Eaters - how else could we live as if death and personal annihilation only happened to other people? The Qlippothic aspect of Yesod occurs when fo undations are rotten and disintegrating and only the superfici al appearance remains unchanged - Dorian Gray springs to mind, or cases where the brain is damaged and the body remains and carr ies out basic instinctive functions, but the person is dead as far as other people are concerned. Organisations are just as pr one to this as people. [1] A.E. Powell, \"The Etheric Double\", Theosophi cal Publishing  House, 1925 [2] A.E.

The possibility of occurring in states of affairs is the form of an object. Form is the possibility of structure.\"  Wittgenstein \"Since feeling is first who pays any attention to the syntax of things will never wholly kiss you.\"  E.E. Cummings The title of the sephira Hod is sometimes translated as Splendour and sometimes as Glory. The title of the sephira Netzach is usually translated as Victory, sometimes as Endurance, and occasionally as Eternity. Although there ha ve been many attempts to explain the titles of this pair of sep hiroth, I am not aware of a convincing explanation. The two sephiroth correspond to the legs and like the legs are normally taken as a pair and not indivi dually. They complement another but are not opposites any more t han force and form are opposites. This pair of sephiroth provi de the first example of the polarity of form and force enc ountered when ascending back up the lightning flash from the sep hira Malkuth. Neither quality manifests in a pure state, as form and force are thoroughly mixed together at the level of Hod and Netzach: the force aspect represented by Netzach is differentiat ed (an example of form) into a multitude of forces, and the form aspect represented by Hod acts dynamically (an example of force) by synthesising new forms and structures. Both sephir oth represent the plurality of consciousness at this level, and in older texts they are referred to as the \"armies\" or \"hosts\". To understand why they are referred to in this way it is necessa ry to look at an archaic aspect of Kabbalistic symbolism whereby the Tree of Life is a representation of kingship. One of the titles of Tiphereth is Melekh, or k ing. This king is the child of Chokhmah (Abba, the father) and Bi nah (Aima, the Mother) and hence a son of God who wears the crown of Kether. The kingdom is the sephira Malkuth, at the same time q ueen (Malkah) and bride (Kallah). In his right hand the king wie lds the sword of justice (corresponding to Gevurah), and in his left the sceptre of authority (corresponding to Chesed), and he rules over the armies or hosts (Tzaba), which are Hod and Net zach. The use of kingship as a metaphor to convey what the s ephiroth mean obscures as much as it reveals, but it is an unavoi dable piece of Kabbalistic symbolism, and the attribution of Hod and Netzach to the \"armies\" does capture something useful about t he nature of consciousness at this level: consciousness is fr agmented into innumerable warring factions, and if there is no rightful king ruling over the kingdom of the soul (a common state of affairs),"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"then the armies elect a succession of leaders from the ranks, who wear a lopsided crown and occupy the throne only f or as long as it takes to find another claimant - more on this la ter. The psychological interpretation of Hod is that it corresponds to the ability to abstract, to conc eptualise, to reason, to communicate, and this level of conscio usness arises from the fact that in order to survive we have evol ved a nervous system capable of building internal representations of the world. I can drive around London in a car because I posses s an internal representation of the London street system. I can d iagnose faults in the same car because I have an internal represen tation of its mechanical and electrical systems and how they migh t fail. I can type this document without looking at the keyboard because I know where the keys are positioned, and your ability t o read what I have written pre-supposes a shared understandi ng about the meaning of words and what they represent. Our ne rvous systems possess an absolutely basic ability to cre ate internal representations out of the information we are capable of perceiving through our senses. It is also an absolutely basic characteristic of the world that it is bigger than my nervous system. I ca nnot possibly create *accurate*, internal representations of the world, and one of the meanings of the verb \"to abstract\" is \"to re move quietly\". This is what the nervous system does: it quietly r emoves most of what is going on in the world in order to create an abridged representation of reality with all the important (important to me) bits underlined in highlighter pen. This is t he world \"I\" live in: not in the \"real\" world, but an int ernal reality synthesised by my nervous system. There has be en a lot of philosophising about this, and it is difficult to t hink about how our nervous systems *might* be distorting or even manufacturing reality without a feeling of unease, but I am personally reassured by the everyday observation that most adu lts can drive a car on a busy road at eighty miles per hour in reasonable safety. This suggests that while our synthe tic internal representation of the world isn't accurate, it isn' t at all bad. Abstraction does not end at the point of building an internal representation of the external world. My nervous system is quite content to treat my internal representatio n of the world as yet another domain over which it can carry out further abstraction, and the subsequent new world of ab stractions as another domain, and so on indefinitely, giving rise to the principal definition of \"abstraction\": \"to sep arate by the operation of the mind, as in forming a general concept from consideration of particular instances\". As an exa mple, suppose someone asks me to watch the screen of a computer a nd to describe what I see. I have no idea what to expect. \"Hmmm...lots of dots moving around random ly...different colour dots...red, blue, green. Ah, the do ts seem to be clustering...they're forming circles...all the dots of each particular colour are forming circles, lo ts of little circles. Now the circles are coming togethe r to form a number...it's 3. Now they're moving apart and forming another number...its 15...now 12..9.. 14. They've gone..........that was it..3, 15, 12, 9, 14. I s it some sort of test? Do I have to guess the next number i n the series?"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" What are the numbers supposed to mean? What wa s the point of it? Hmmm..the numbers might stand for le tters of the alphabet...let's see. C..O..L..I...N. It's my name!\" The dots on the screen are real - there are re al, discrete, measurable spots of light on the screen. I coul d verify the presence of dots of light using an appropriate ligh t meter. The colours are synthesised by my retinas; different e lements in my eye respond to different frequencies in the light and give rise to an internal experience we label \"red\", \"blue\", \"green\". The circles simply do not exist: given the nature of the computer output on the screen, there are only individual pix els, and it is my nervous system which constructs circles. The n umbers do not exist either; it is only because of my particul ar upbringing (which I share with the person who wrote the comp uter program) that I am able to distinguish patterns standing for abstract numbers in patterns of circles e.g. oo o o o o o o o ooooo And once I begin to reason about the *meaning* of a sequence of numbers I have left the real world a long way behin d: not only is \"number\" a complex abstraction, but when I ask a q uestion about the \"meaning\" of \"a sequence of numbers\" I am wor king with an even more \"abstract abstraction\". My ability to h appily juggle numbers and letters and decide that there is an ide ntity between the abstract number sequence \"3, 15, 12, 9, 14\" and the character string \"COLIN\" is one of those commonplace thin gs which any person might do and yet it illustrates how easy it is to become completely detached from the external world and fu nction within an internal world of abstractions which have been detached from anything in the world for so long that they are t aken as real without a second thought. In parallel with our ability to structure perc eption into an internal world of abstractions we possess the ability to communicate facts about this internal world. When I say \"The cup is on the table\", another person is able to identi fy in the real world, out of all the information reaching their senses, the abstraction \"chair\", the abstraction \"cup\", and confirm the relationship of \"on-ness\". Why are the cup and table abstractions? Because the word \"cup\" does not uni quely specify any particular cup in the world, and when I use t he word I am assuming that the listener already possesses an internal representation of an abstract object \"cup\", and can use that abstract specification of a cup to identify a part icular object in the context within which my statement was made. We are not normally conscious of this proces s, and don't need to be when dealing with simple propositions ab out objects in the real world. I think I know what a cup is, and I think you do too. If you don't know, ask someone to show you a few. Life gets"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"a lot more complicated when dealing with com plex internal abstractions: what is a \"contract\", a \"treaty \", a \"loan\", \"limited liability\", a \"set\", a \"function\", \"marria ge\", a \"tort\", \"natural justice\", a \"sephira\", a \"religion\", \" sin\", \"good\", \"evil\", and so on (and on). We reach agreeme nt about the definitions of these things using language. In so me cases, for example, a mathematical object, the thing is c ompletely and unambiguously defined using language, while in oth er cases (e.g. \"good\", \"sin\") there is no universally accepted de finition. Life is further complicated by a widespread lack of a wareness that these internal abstractions *are* internal, and it is common to find people projecting internal abstractions onto t he world as if they were an intrinsic part of the fabric of exist ence, and as objectively real as the particular cup and the part icular table I referred to earlier. Marriage is no longer a contr act between a man and a woman; it is an estate made in heaven. W hat is heaven? God knows. And what is God? Trot out your definit ions and let's have an argument - that is the way such questions are answered. Much of the content of electronic bulletin boards consists of endless arguments and discussions on the definitio n of complex internal abstractions (what is ritual, what is ma gic, what is karma, what is ki, what is...). A third element which goes together with ab straction and language to complete the essense of the sephira Ho d is reason, and reason's formal offspring, logic. Reason is t he ability to articulate and justify our beliefs about the world using a base of generally agreed facts and a generally agreed technique for combining facts to infer valid conclusions. If reason is considered as one out of a number of possible processes for establishing what is true about the world we live in, for establishing which models of reality are valid and which are not, then it has been phenomenally successful: in its heyday there were those who saw reason as the most divine facult y, the faculty in humankind most akin to God, and that legacy is s till with us - the words \"unreasonable\" and \"irrational\" are o ften used to attack and denigrate someone who does not (or canno t) articulate what they do or why they do it. There is of cours e no \"reason\" why we should have to articulate or justify anyth ing, even to ourselves, but the reasoning machine within u s demands an \"explanation\" for every phenomenon, and a \"reaso n\" for every action. This is a characteristic of reason - it is an obsessive mode of consciousness. A second characteristic of reason is that it operates on the \"garbage-in, garbage-out\" princ iple: if the base of given facts a person uses to reason about a re garbage, so are the conclusions - witness what two thous and years of Christian theology has achieved using sound dialectical principles taken from Aristotle. If the sephira Hod on the Pillar of Form r epresents the active synthesis of abstract forms in consci ousness (and abstraction, language and reason are prime exampl es) then the sephira Netzach on the Pillar of Force represe nts affective states of consciousness which influence how we ac t and react: needs, wants, drives, feelings, moods and emotio ns. It is difficult to write about affective states, to be clear on the distinction between a need and a want on one hand, or a feeling or a mood on the other, and I find it particula rly difficult because the essence of sadness is *being* sad, th e essence of"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"excitement is the *feeling* of excitement, the ess ence of desire is the aching, lusting, overwhelming *feeling* of desire, and being too precise about defining feelings is in th e essence of Hod, *not* Netzach. These things are incommunicabl e. They can be produced in another person, but they cannot be com municated. It is possible to be clinical and abstract and preci se about the sephira Hod because an abstract clinical precision captures that aspect of consciousness perfectly, but when attempting to communicate something about Netzach one feels temp ted to try to communicate feelings themselves, a task more suite d to a poet or a musician, an actor or a dancer. Please accept th is unfortunate limitation in what follows, a limitation not neces sarily present when Kaballah is learned at first hand from someone . Netzach is on the Pillar of Force, but in rea ching Netzach the Lightning Flash has already passed through Bina h and Gevurah on the Pillar of Form and so it represents a forc e conditioned and constrained by form; when we talk about Ne tzach we are talking about the different ways force can b e shaped and directed, like toothpaste squeezed out of a tube. The toothpaste we are talking about is something I will call \"li fe force\" or \"life energy\", and as a rule, when I have a lot of it I feel well and full of vitality, and when I don't have much I feel unwell, tired, and vulnerable. To continue the some what phallic toothpaste metaphor, the magnitude of pressure on the tube corresponds to vitality, the direction in which t he toothpaste comes out corresponds to a need or a want, and the shape of the nozzle corresponds to a feeling: all three facto rs, pressure, direction and nozzle determine how the toothpaste c omes out; that is, we could say that there are three factors givi ng a *form* to the toothpaste (or life-energy). It may seem sloppy and unnecessarily metaphysical to imply that all need s, wants and feelings are merely conditions of manifestation of something more basic, some \"unconditioned force\", but Kaballah i s primarily a tool for exploring internal states, and there are i nternal states (certainly in my experience) where this force i s experienced directly with much less differentiation, henc e the clumsy metaphor. Textbooks on psychology define a need as an i nternal state which results in directed behaviour, and discuss needs such as thirst, hunger, sex, stimulation, proximity seeki ng, curiousity and so on. These things are interesting, but for virtually everyone such basic and inherent needs are in t he nature of \"givens\" and don't provide much individual insi ght into the questions \"why do I behave differently from other people?\", or \"should I change my behaviour?\", or more interest ing still \"to what extent do I (or can I) influence my behaviour? \". In addition to inherent needs it is useful also to look at nee ds which have been acquired (i.e. learned), and for convenienc e I will call them \"wants\" because people are usually conscious of \"wanting\" something specific. To give some examples, a person might want: - to buy a bar of chocolate. - to go to the toilet. - to own a better car. - to have a sexual relationship with someone. - to live forever. - to be thinner (more musculer, taller , whiter,"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" browner...). - to read a book. - to gain social recognition within a particu lar group. - to win in sport. - to go shopping. - to go to bed. Not only are these \"wants\" the sort of thing many people want these days, but these \"wants\" can all occur concur rently in the same person, and while some may have been simmeri ng away on a back burner for years, there can be an astonishin g variety of pots and pans waiting for an immediate turn on th e stove. The average person's consciousness zips around the ki tchen like a demented short-order cook stirring this dish, serv ing that one, slapping a pot on the stove for a few minutes only to take it off and put something else on, throwing whole meals in the bin only to empty them back into pots a few minutes later. The choice of which pot ends up on the hot plate depends largely on mood and accident: some people may plan their lives like military campaigns but most don't. Most people have far mo re wants than there are hours in the day to achieve them, and th ose which are actually satisfied on a given day is more a functio n of accident than design. Careers are thrown away (along wit h status and security) in a moment of sexual infatuation; the desire to eat wars with the desire to be slim; the writer re tires to the country to write the great novel and does everythi ng but write; the manager desperately tries to finish an urgen t report but finds himself dreaming about a car he saw in the c ar park; the student abandons an important essay on impulse to go out with friends. One activity is quickly replaced by an other as the person attempts to reconcile all his wants and drives, but unfortunately there is no requirement that wan ts should be internally consistent or complementary; like a multi-process operating system, a single thread of energy is ra ndomly cycled around an arbitrary list of needs and wants to prod uce the mixed- up complexity of the average person. Each want can be treated as a distinct mode of consciousness - I can eat a sla p-up meal one day and thoroughly enjoy it, while the next day I c an look in the mirror and swear never to touch another pizza again . It is as if two separate beings inhabited my body, one who lov es pizzas and one who wants to be thin, and each makes plans ind ependently of the other, and only the magic dust of unbroken me mory sustains the illusion that I am a single person. When I vie w my own wants and actions dispassionately I can conclude that th ere is a host or army of independent beings jostling inside me, a crowd of artificial elementals individually ensouled with enough of my energy to bring one particular desire to fruition. I cope with the semi-chaotic result of mob rule by using th e traditional remedy: public relations. I put together internal press releases (various rationalisations and justifications) to co nvince myself, and others if need be, that the mess was either du e to external circumstances beyond my control (I didn't have time last night), the fault of other people (you made me angry), or inevitable (I had no choice, there was no alternative). In cases where even my public relations don't work I erect a shrine to the gods of Guilt and make little offerings of sorrow and regret ove r the years. This is normal consciousness for most people. It is a kind"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"of insanity. Wants rush to and fro on the stage of consciousness like actors in the closing scenes of Julius Caeser - alarums and excursions, bodies litter the stage, trumpets and battle shouts in the wings, Brutus falls on his sword, Anthony cl aims the field - perhaps this is why the sephira is called Victor y! Every day new wants are kicked off in response to adverti sing or peer pressure, old wants compete with each other in a z ero-sum game. Having said this, I should point out that it is n ot desire or wants or drives which create the insanity - Kabal lah does not place the value judgement on desire that Buddhis m does (that desire is the cause of suffering, and by inference , something to be overcome). The insanity arises from mob-rule, fr om the bizarre internal processes of justification, rationalisati on and guilt, and from the identification of Self with the resu lt - I will return to this when discussing the sephira Tipheret h, as the mis- identification of Self is a key element in the discussion on Tiphereth. Netzach also corresponds to our feelings, emotions and moods, because this background of \"psychologi cal weather\" strongly conditions the way in which we think and behave: regardless of what I am doing, my energy w ill manifest differently when I am happy than when I am not. So metimes moods and emotions are triggered by a specific event, and sometimes they are not: free-floating anxiety and depressio n are common enough, and perhaps free-floating happiness is too (I can't speak from experience there ;-). There are hundreds of words for different moods, emotions and feelings, but most se em to refer to different degrees of intensity of the same thing, or the same feeling in different contexts, and the number of genuinely distinct internal dimensions of feeling appears to be small. Depression, misery, sadness, happiness, delight, jo y, rapture and ecstacy seem to lie along the same axis, as do lo athing, hate, dislike, affection, and love. It is an interesti ng exercise to identify the genuinely, qualitatively different feelings you can experience by actually conjuring up each fee ling. I have tried the experiment with a number of people, and you will probably find there are less than 10 distinct feeli ngs. The most immediate and personal correspondence s for Hod and Netzach are the psychological correspondences: the rational, abstract, intellectual and communicative on one h and and the emotional, motivational, intuitive, aesthetic, an d non-rational on the other. The planetary and elemental correspo ndences mirror this: Hod corresponds to Kokab or Mercury, and t he element of Air, while Netzach corresponds to Nogah or Venus, a nd the element Water. The Virtue of Hod is honesty or truthfulness, and its Vice is dishonesty or untruthfulness. One of the featu res of being able to create abstract representations of reality and communicate some aspect of it to another person i s that it is possible to *misrepresent* reality, or to put it bluntly, lie through your teeth. The Illusion of Hod is order, in the sense of attempting to impose one's sense of order upon the world. This is very noticeable in some people; whenever something happ ens they will immediately pigeonhole it and declare with great au thority \"it is just another example of XYZ\". A surprising number of people who"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"claim to be rational will claim \"there's no s uch thing as (ghosts, telepathy, free lunches, UFO's)\" without h aving examined the evidence one way or the other. They are probabl y right, and I have no personal interest either way, but it is no t difficult to distinguish between someone who carefully weighs the pros and cons in an argument and readily admits to unc ertainty, and someone with a firm and orderly conviction that \"th is is the way the world is\". The illusion of order occurs b ecause people confuse their internal representation of the world with the world itself, and whenever they are confronted with s omething they attempt to fit it into their representation. The illusion of order (that everything in the world can be neatly classified) relates closely to the klippoth of Hod, which is rigidity, or rigid order. As children we star t out with an open view of what the world is like, and by the tim e we reach our late teens or early twenties this view has set fair ly solid, like cold porridge - there are few minds more full of ce rtainties than that of an eighteen year old. A good critical educa tion sometimes has the effect of stirring the porridge into a lump y gruel, but it gradually starts to set again (unless the heavy hand of fate stirs it up), and it is generally recognised, parti cularly in the sciences, that a deeply ingrained sense of \"how t hings are\" is the greatest obstacle to progress. If you he ar some kids listening to music and find yourself thinking \"I do n't know what they find in that noise!\" then it's happening to yo u too. If find yourself looking back to a time when everything was so much better than it is today and find yourself declari ng \"nostalgia isn't what it used to be\" then you will know that the porridge has gone very cold and very stiff. The Vision of Hod is the Vision of Splendo ur. There is regularity and order in the world - it's not all a n illusion - and when someone is able to appreciate natural order in its abstract sense, via mathematics for example, it can lead to a genuinely religious, even ecstatic experience. T he thirteenth century Kabbalist Abraham Abulafia developed a rigo rous system of Hebrew letter mysticism based on the letters o f the Hebrew alphabet, their symbolic meanings, and th eir abstract relationships when permuted into different \"names o f God\"; many hours of intense concentration spent combining lett ers according to complex rules generated highly abstract symbolic meanings and insights which led to ecstatic experiences. The sam e sense of awe can come from mathematics and science - the rea lisation that gravitational dynamics in three dimensions is geom etry in four dimensions, that plants are living fractals, that primes are the seeds of all other numbers, are just as likely to l ead towards an intense vision of the splendour of the world made v isible through the eye of the rational intellect. The Virtue of Netzach is unselfishness, and its Vice is selfishness. Both the Virtue and the Vice are an at titude towards things-which-are-not-me, specifically, other peop le and living creatures. If I was surrounded by a hundred square miles of empty desert then my attitude to other living things wou ldn't matter, but I don't, and nothing I do is without some co nsequence; my needs, wants and feelings invariably have an effe ct on people, animals and plants, who all want to live and have some level of needs and wants and feelings too. Unselfishness is simply a"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"recognition of others' needs. Selfishness taken to an extreme is a denial of life, because it denies freedom and li fe to anything which gets in the way; my needs must come first. N etzach lies on the Pillar of Force and is an expression of life-e nergy, so to deny life is a perversion of the force symbolised by Netzach, hence the attribution of selfishness to the Vice. The Vision of Netzach is the Vision of Beaut y Triumphant. Whereas the Vision of Splendour corresponding to Ho d is a vision of complex abstract relationships, symmetry, and mathematical elegance, the Vision of Beauty Triumphant is purely aesthetic and firmly based in the real world of textures, smells , sounds, and colours, an appropriate correspondence for Venus, the goddess of sensual beauty. Suppose two housebuyers go to look at a house. The first is interested in the number of rooms, the size of the garage, the house's position relative to local amenities, th e price, the number of square metres in the plot, and whether t he windows are double-glazed. The second person likes the decor ation in the lounge, the colour of the bathroom, the wisteria plant in the garden, the cherry tree, the curving shape of the s tairs, and the sloping roof in one of the bedrooms. Both people l ike the house, but the first likes various abstract properties as sociated with the house, whereas the second likes the house itsel f. Suppose the same two people buy the house and decide to do ritu al magic. The first person wants white robes because white is the colour of the powers of light and life. The second wants a gree n velvet robe because it feels and looks nice. The first reads lo ts of books on how to carry out a ritual, while the second sits un der the cherry tree in the garden with a flute and a blissful expression of cosmic love. The first person has continued to make choices based on an abstract notion of what is correct, while th e second makes choices based on what *feels right*. Both are driven by an internal sense of \"rightness\", but in the first ca se it is based on abstract criteria, while in the second it is bas ed on personal aesthetic notion of beauty. The Vision of Beauty Triumphant has a compelli ng power. It is pre-articulate and inherently uncritical, and at the same time it is immensely biased. A person in its grip w ill pronounce judgement on another person's taste in art, litera ture, clothes, music, decor or whatever, and will do it with su ch a profound lack of self-consciousness that it is possible to believe good taste is ordained in heaven. This person will mo ck those who surround themselves with rules, regulations, pr inciples, and analysis, the \"syntax of things\" as E. E. Cumming s puts it, and instead exhibit a whimsical spontaneity, a penetra ting (so they believe) intuition, and a free spirit in tune with ebb and flow of life. There are those who might complain about their astounding arrogance, fickleness, unreliability, and the never- ending flow of unshakable and prejudiced opinions d elivered with papal authority, but those who complain are (c learly) anal- retentive nit-pickers and don't count. For a total immersion in the aesthetic vision read Oscar Wilde's \"The Pictu re of Dorian Grey\". The Illusion of Netzach is projection. We all tend to identify feelings and characteristics in other peo ple which we find in ourselves and when we get it right it is ca lled \"empathy\" or \"intuition\"; when we get it wrong it is called \"projection\","},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"because we are incorrectly projecting our fee lings, needs, motives, or desires onto another person and inter preting their behaviour accordingly. Some level of projection is unavoidable, and at best it can be balanced with a critical awar eness that it can occur, but projection is insidious, and the strength of feeling associated with a projection can easily overwhelm any intellectual awareness. Projection usually \"feels r ight\". One of the most overwhelming forms of projecti on accompanies sexual desire. Why do I find one person sexually a ttractive and not another? Why do I find some characteristics in a person sexually attractive but not others? In my own case I discovered that when I put together all the characteristics I found most attractive in a person a consistent picture emerged of an \"ideal person\", and every person I had ever considered a s a possible sexual partner was instantly compared against this template. In fact there was more than one template, more than o ne ideal, but the number was limited and each template was very clearly defined, and most importantly, each template was internal. My sexual (and often many other feelings) about a pers on were based on an internal and apparently arbitrary internal t emplate. This was crazy; I found my sexual feelings about a perso n would change depending on how they dressed or behaved, on h ow well they \"matched the ideal\". It became obvious that what I was in love with did not exist outside of myself, and I was t rying to find this ideal in everyone else. Each one of these \"te mplates\" was a living aspect of myself which I had chosen not to r egard as \"me\", and in compensation I spent much of my time trying to find people to bring these parts to life, like a director audi tioning actors and actresses for a part in a new play. If a pers on previously identified as ideal failed to live up to my notion of how they should be ideally behaving then I would project a f ault on them: there was something wrong with *them*! Madness inde ed. The Swiss psychologist C. G. Jung [1] re cognised this phenomenon and gave these idealised and projected components of our psyche the title \"archetype\". Jung ident ified several archetypes, and it is worth mentioning the ma jor and most influential. The Anima is the ideal female archetype. She is part genetic, part cultural, a figure molded by fashion and advertising, an unconscious composite of woman in the abstract. The Anima is common in men, where she can appear with riveting power in dreams and fantasy, a projection brought to life by the not inconsiderable power of the male sexual drive. She might be meek and submissive, seductive and alluring, vampish and dangerous, a cheap slut or an unattainable goddess - there is no \"standard anima\", but there are many recognisable patterns which can have a powerful hold on particular men. Male s exual fantasy material is amazingly predictable, cliched, unim aginitive and crude, and contains a limited number of steroety ped views of women which are as close to a \"lowest common denom inator anima\" as one is likely to find. The Animus is the ideal male archetype, and m uch of what is true about the Anima is true of the Animus. There are differences; the predominant quality in the Anima is her appearance and behaviour, while the predominant q uality in the Animus is social power and competence. In the inter ests of sexual equality it is worth mentioning that female rom antic fantasy"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"material is amazingly predictable, cliched, unim aginitive and crude, and contains a limited number of stereotype views of men which are as close to a \"lowest common denominator animus\" as one is likely to find. The Shadow is the projection of \"not-me\" and contains forbidden or repressed desires and impulses. In most men the Anima is repressed and in most women the Animus is repressed, and so both form a component of the Shadow. The major part of the Shadow however is composed of forbidden impulses, and the Shadow forms a personification of evil. Much of what is c onsidered evil is defined socially and the communal personificati on of evil as an external force working against humankind (such as Satan) is widespread. The Persona is the mask a person wears as a member of a community when a large proportion of his or her behaviour is defined by a role such as doctor, teacher, manager , accountant, lawyer or whatever. Projection occurs in two w ays: firstly, someone may be expected to conform to a role in a particularly rigid or stereotyped way, and so suffer a loss of individuality and probably a degree of misplaced trust or prejudi ce. Secondly, many people identify with a role to the extent tha t they carry that role into all aspects of their private lives. This \"projection onto self\" is a form of identifi cation - see the section on Tiphereth. The archetype of Self at the level of Hod an d Netzach is usually projected as an ideal form of person; that is, someone will believe that he or she is highly imperfect cr eature and it is possible to attain an ideal state of being in w hich the same person is kind, loving, wise, forgiving, comp assionate, in harmony with the Absolute, or whatever. This pr ojection will either fasten on a living or dead person, who th en becomes a hero, heroine, guru, or master with grossly infla ted abilities, or it fastens on a vision of \"myself made perfect\". The projected vision of \"myself made perfect\" is common (almo st universal) among those seeking \"spiritual development\", \"esote ric training\", and other forms of self-improvement, and in almost every case it is based on an abstract ideal. The person will pr obably insist that the ideal has existed in certain rare individ uals (usually long dead saints and gurus, or someone who lives a long way off whom they haven't met), and that is the sort of pe rson they want to be. It should be comical, but it isn't. There is more to say about this and it will keep till the section on Tip hereth. The klippoth or shell of Netzach is habit and routine. When behaviour, with all its potential for new experien ces, new ways of doing things, new relationships, becomes locked into patterns which repeat over and over again, then the life ene rgy, the force aspect of Netzach is withdrawn and all that remains is the dead, empty shell of behaviour. Just as the klippoth of Hod is rigid order, the petrification of one's internal repr esentation of reality, so the klippoth of Netzach is the pet rification of behaviour. The God Names of Hod and Netzach are Elohim Tzabaoth and Jehovah Tzabaoth respectively, which mean \"God of A rmies\", but in each case a different word is used for \"God\". The name \"Elohim\" is associated with all three sephiroth on the Pilla r of Form and"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"represents a feminine (metaphorically speaking) ten dency in that aspect of God. The elucidation of God Names can become phenomenally complex and obscure, with long ex cursions into gematria and textual analysis of the Pentateuch and it is a quagmire I intend to avoid. The Archangels are Raphael and Haniel. The Ar changel of Hod is sometimes given as Michael, but I prefer Raphae l (Medicine of God) for no other reason than the association of Mercury with medicine and healing; besides, Michael has perfectl y good reasons for residing in Tiphereth. This sort of thing can g ive rise to an amazing amount of hot air when Kabbalists meet; f or those who wonder how far back the confusion goes, Robert Flu dd (1574-1607) plumped for Raphael, whereas two hundred years later Francis Barrett prefered Michael. The co-founder of the Go lden Dawn, S.L. Mathers, went for both depending on which text you read. Kabbalah isn't an orderly subject and those who want to imp ose too much order on it are falling into the illusion of...I le ave this as an exercise to the reader. The Angel Orders are the Beni Elohim and the Elohim. The triad of sephiroth Yesod, Hod and Netzach comp rise the triad of \"normal consciousness\" as we normally expe rience it in ourselves and most people most of the time. T his level of consciousness is intensely magical; try to move aw ay from it for any length of time and you will discover the str ength of the force and form sustaining it. It is not an exagge ration to say that most people are completely unable to leave thi s state, even when they want to, even when they desperately try t o. The sephira Tiphereth represents a state of being which unlocks the energy of \"normal consciousness\" and is the subject of the ne xt section. [1] Jung, C.G, \"Aion: Researches into the Pheno menology of the Self\", Routledge & Kegan Paul 19 74 Tiphereth --------- \"Nothing is left to you at this moment but to burst out into a loud laugh\" From \"The Spirit of Zen\" The sephira Tiphereth lies at the heart of the Tree of Life, and like Rome all paths lead to it. Well, not all, but Tiphereth has a path linking it to every sephira with the exception of Malkuth. If the Tree of Life is a map then the s ephira titled Tiphereth, Beauty, or Rachamin, Compassion, clea rly represents something of central importance. What does it repr esent? Can you imagine in your mind's eye what it might be? Do you feel anything within you when you contemplate Tiphereth? If ask ed could you define what it stands for? Well, if you can do a ny or all of these things you are almost certainly barking up th e wrong Tree. As Alan Watts comments [1]: \"The method of Zen is to baffle, excite, puzz le and exhaust the intellect until it is realised that intell ection is only thinking *about*; it will provoke, irrita te and again exhaust the emotions until it is realised tha t emotion is"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" only feeling *about*, and then it contriv es, when the disciple has been brought to an intellectual and emotional impasse, to bridge the gap between second-ha nd conceptual contact with reality, and first-hand experienc e.\" The sephira Tiphereth presents the student of Kab balah with a conundrum. Whatever you say it is, it isn't; whatev er you imagine it to be it isn't; whatever you feel it might be, i t isn't; it is an empty room. There is nothing there. The modes of consciousness appropriate to Hod, Yesod and Netzach respecti vely are not appropriate to something which is clearly and unamb iguously shown on the Tree as being distinct from all three. So w hat is it? The student is told that the Virtue of Tiphereth is De votion to the Great Work. What is this \"Great Work\"? The stu dent is told solemnly that in order to find the answer he or she should obtain the Spiritual Experience of Tiphereth, which is the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. So the st udent runs off and duely reports (after some work in the library perhaps) that the Great Work is the raising of a human being in e very aspect to perfection. Or it is the saving of the planet fr om industrial pollution. Or it is the retrieval and perpetuation of knowledge, or perhaps it is the spiritual redemption of humanity. The student then burns enough frankincense to pay off the Somalian national debt, records endless conversations w ith the Holy Guardian Angel in the magical record, and impre sses all and sundry with an unbending commitment to the Grea t Work. This enthusiasm, commitment, personal sacrifice and s ense of moral purpose leads to the development of a special kin d of person: pious, preaching, judgemental, a humble servant of the highest powers with a blind spot of intolerance. Those wh o inhabit the vicinity of such moral incandescence may have reas on to recall that the Vice of Tiphereth is self-importance and p ride. A student can spend years running around in circles, bringing to the planet the benefits of advan ced spiritual consciousness, and this seems to be a necessary ex ercise. People need to sweat various personal obsessions out of t heir systems, and the empty room of Tiphereth is an excellent se t on which to act out a personal drama. If the devotion to the Wo rk is genuine, and if Tiphereth and the HGA are invoked with passion and determination, then sooner or later the hand of fat e lends a hand and the student has the shit knocked out in a big w ay. An attempt to penetrate the nature of Tiphereth does seem to bring about that state which the Greeks called \"hubris\", a n overweening arrogance, self-importance and pride, until e ventually the inevitable happens and one's life comes crashing down around one's ears. The resulting mess varies from person to person; in some people every idea about what is important is turned upside down, while in others an emotional attachmen t to habits, lifestyle, possessions or relationships turns to du st. The daemon of the false self is dealt a massive blow and sent reeling, and in that moment there is a chance for real change an d the dawning of the golden sun of Tiphereth. This is how I interpret the word \"initiation\" : there is a state of being represented by the sephirah Tipher eth which is absolutely distinct from what most people experien ce as normal consciousness. Once attained the change is irr eversible and permanent; it causes a permanent change in the way life is"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"experienced. When it occurs it is recognised insta ntly for what it is...as if every cell in one's body shouted simu ltaneously \"So *that's* all there is to it!\" This state has been widely documented in many parts of the world, and Alan Watts' book (referenced below) is as guarded and explicit on t he subject as any worthwhile book is likely to be. The symbolism of Tiphereth is three-fold: a king, a sacrificed god, and a child. This three-fo ld symbolism corresponds to Tiphereth's place on the extended Tree (to be explained in a later chapter), where it appears as Kether of Assiah, Tiphereth of Yetzirah, and Malkuth of Briah , and to these three aspects correspond the king, the sacrificed god, and the child respectively. One interpretation of this sy mbolism is as follows: if the kingdom is to be redeemed then the king (who is also the son of God - see below) must be sacrific ed, and from this sacrifice comes a rebirth as a child. This is a metaphor of initiation. It is also markedly Christian in symbol ism, an aspect many explicitly Christian Kabbalists have not faile d to elaborate upon, but it would be a mistake to make too much out of the apparent Christian symbolism. The king, the child a nd the son are synonyms for Tiphereth in the earliest Kabbalis tic documents (e.g. the Zohar), and the introduction of divine ki ngship and the sacrificed god into modern Kabbalah owes a lot more to the publication of \"The Golden Bough\" [2] in 1922 tha n it does to Christianity. The theme of death and rebirth is an importan t element in many esoteric traditions, and provides continuity between modern Kabbalah and the mystery religions and initia tions of the Mediterranean basin. The initiatory rituals of th e Golden Dawn [3], an organisation which did much to reawaken interest in Kabbalah, were loosely inspired by the Eleusinian mysteries of Demeter and Persephone - at least to extent tha t the Temple officers were named after the principal offi cers of the Eleusinian mysteries. The Golden Dawn Tiphereth in itiation was, like most Golden Dawn rituals, a witch's brew of s ymbolism, but it was strongly based on the mysteries of the cruci fixion and the resurrection - at one point the aspirant was actual ly lashed to a cross - and took place in a symbolic reconstruction of the vault and tomb of Christian Rosenkreutz. The following extract [3] gives the flavour of the thing: \"Buried with that Light in a mystical death, r ising again in a mystical resurrection, cleansed and purifie d through Him our Master, O Brother of the Cross and the Ros e. Like Him, O Adepts of all ages, have ye toiled. Like Him have ye suffered tribulation. Poverty, torture and death have ye passed through. They have been but the purifi cation of the Gold.\" Gold is a Tiphereth symbol, being the metal of She mesh, the Sun, which also corresponds to Tiphereth. Gold is inco rruptible and symbolises a state of being which is not \"base\" or \"corrupt\"; again, it is a symbol of initiation, of a state of being compared to which normal consciousness is corruptible dross. I do not wish to go any further into this kind of symbolism - there is an awful lot of it. It is possible to w rite at great"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"length and succeed in doing nothing more than losi ng the reader in a web of symbolism so dense and sticky that the inner state one is pointing at becomes a sterile thing of words and symbols. I wanted to provide an idea of how a large amou nt of exotic symbolism has accreted around Tiphereth, but that is all. The state indicated by Tiphereth is real enough, and lashing comfortably-off middle-class aspirants to a cross in a wooden vault at the local Masonic Hall and prattling on a bout poverty, torture and death is somewhat wide of the mark. In the traditional Kabbalah the sephir a Tiphereth corresponds to something called Zoar Anpin, the Mic roprosopus, or Lesser Countenance. As might be expected, there is also something called Arik Anpin, the Macroprosopus, or Greater Co untenance, and this is often used as a synonym for the sephira Kether. The symbology connected with the Greater and Lesser Co untenances is extremely complex: the \"Greater Holy Assembly\" [4] , one of the books of the Zohar, is largely a detailed descri ption of the cranium, the eyes, the cheeks, and the hairs in the beard of both the Greater and Lesser Countenances. In a cru de sense the Macroprosopus is God, and the Microprosopus is man made in God's image, hence the symbolism, but this is too simple. The Microprosopus is also the archetypal man Adam Kadmo n, a mystical concept which should not be confused with a real human being. Adam Kadmon is androgynous, male and female, Adam -and-Eve in a pre-manifest, pre-Fall state of divine perfection. The symbology of the Macroprosopus, Microprosopus, and Adam Kad mon appears to exist independently of the concept of sephirothic e manation, and it is probably fair to say that the former was more highly developed during the Zoharic period of Kabbalah, wh ile the latter is used almost exclusively at the present time - I have yet to encounter a modern Kabbalist with much insig ht into the thirteen parts of the beard of the Macroprosopus. Another rich set of symbols associated with Ti phereth comes from the divine name of four letters YHVH, usuall y written as Jehovah or Yahweh. The letter Yod is associated wit h the supernal father Chokhmah, and the letter He is associa ted with the supernal mother Binah. The letter Vov is associate d with the son of the mother and father, and is both the Micropro sopus and the sephira Tiphereth. The final He is associated with the daughter (and bride of the son), the sephira Malkuth. Tiph ereth is thus the \"child\" of Chokhmah and Binah, and also \"the s on of God\". In Hebrew the letter Vov can represent the number 6, a nd in Kabbalah this refers to Chesed, Gevurah, Tiphereth, Netz ach, Hod and Yesod, the six sephiroth which correspond to sta tes of human consciousness and hence also to the Microprosopus. With a typical Kabbalistic flexibility they can also stand for th e six days of Creation. The illusion of Tiphereth is Identification. When a person is asked \"what are you\", they will usually begin w ith statements like \"I am a human being\", \"I am a lorry driver\", \"I am Fred Bloggs\", \"I am five foot eleven\". If pressed fur ther a person might begin to enumerate personal qualities and beh aviours: \"I am trustworthy\", \"I lose my temper a lot\", \"I am afraid of heights\", \"I love chessecake\", \"I hate dogs\". It is extremely common for people to identify what they are with th e totality of their beliefs and behaviours, and they will defend the sanctity of these beliefs and behaviours, often to the dea th - a person"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"might have behaviours which make their life a mise ry and still cling to them with a grip like a python. This inab ility to stand back and see behaviour or beliefs in an impersonal way produces a peculiar ego-centricity: the sense of personal identity is founded on a set of beliefs and behaviours which are largely unconscious (that is, a person may be unawa re of being grotesquely selfish, or pompous, or attention-getti ng) and at the same time seem to be uniquely special and sacred. When behaviour and beliefs are unconscious and incorporated into a sense of identity it becomes impossible to make sense of oth er people. If I am unaware that I regularly slip little p ut-downs into my conversation, and Joe takes umbrage at my sens e of humour, then rather than change my behaviour (which is u nconscious) I interpret the result as \"Joe doesn't have a sense o f humour; he needs to learn to laugh a little\". There are ma ny behaviours which may seem innocuous to the person concerned b ut which are irritating or offensive to others, and when the injured party reacts appropriately it is impossible for me to m ake sense of this reaction if my behaviour is unconscious and ti ghtly bound to my sense of identity. Our sense of identity thus b ecomes a kind of \"Absolute\" against which everything is c ompared, and judgements about the world become absolute and almo st impossible to change, even when we realise intellectually the subjectivity of our position. Referring to this projection of t he unconscious onto the world Jung [5] comments: \"The effect of projection is to isolate the su bject from his environment, since instead of a real relation to it there is now only an illusory one. Projections change the world into one's unknown face.\" In summary, the illusion of Tiphereth is a false identification with a set of beliefs or behaviours. It can also be an identification with a social mask or Person a, something discussed in the section on Netzach. So to return to the orginal question: \"what are you?\". Is there an answer? If the answer is to be something which is not an arbitrary collectio n of emphemera then you are not your behaviours - behaviour can be changed; you are not your beliefs - beliefs can be changed; you are not your role in society - your role in society can change; you are not your body - your body is continually changing. Out of this comes a sense of emptiness, of hollowness. The intellec t attempts to solve the koan of koans but has no anchor to hold o n to. Is there no centre to my being, nothing which is *me*, no axis in the universe, no morality, no good, no evil? Do I live in a meaningless, arbitrary universe where any belief is as good as any other, where any behaviour is acceptable so lon g as I can get away with it? This sense of emptiness or hollo wness is the Qlippoth or shell of Tiphereth, Tiphereth as the E mpty Room with Nothing In It. Jung [6] provides a memorabl e and moving description of how his father, a country parson, was progressively consumed by this feeling of hollownes s. There can be few fates worse than to devote a life to the out ward forms of religion without ever feeling one touch of that wh ich gives it meaning. The God Name of Tiphereth is Jehovah Aloah va Daath, or simply Aloah va Daath. It is often translated as \"God made"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"manifest in the sphere of the mind\". The Archangel is sometimes given as Raphael, but I prefer the attribution to Michael, long associated with solar fire. His name \"Who is like G od\" reinforces the upper/lower relationship between Kether and T iphereth. The angel order is the Malachim, or Kings. To cover all of the traditional material related to Tiphereth is to cover most of Kabbalah. Tipheret h is at the centre of a complex of six sephiroth which repre sent a human being. This isn't a modern interpretation, a n \"initiated\" interpretation of obscure medieval documents. Kabba lah has always been deeply concerned with the dynamics of the relationship between God and the Creation, between God and a hu man being, and the descriptions of the Macroprosopus and Micropro sopus in the Zohar are a bold attempt to grasp something ineff able using a language built from the most immediate of metaphor s, the human body. According to the Bible and Kabbalah, a huma n being is in some sense a reflection of God, and to the extent that Kabbalah is an outcome of genuine mystical experience it is a description of the dynamics of that relationship, and more imp ortantly it is a description of something *real*. Even if you do n't like the look of the word \"God\" (I don't) Kabbalah is tryin g to express something important about a relatively inaccessible dimension of human experience. Tiphereth is a reflection o f Kether and represents the \"image of God\", the \"God within\", whatever you take that to mean; it is a symbol of centrality, balance, and above all, wholeness. It can be an empty ro om, a gaping emptiness, or it can be the heart and blazing sun o f the Tree. It is the symbol of a human being who lives in full co nsciousness of the outer and the inner, who denies neither the r eality of the world nor the mystery of self-consciousness, and wh o attempts to reconcile the needs of both in a harmonious balance .

L awrence The title of the sephira Gevurah is t ranslated as \"strength\", and sometimes as \"power\". The sep hira is also referred to by its alternative titles of Din, \" justice\", and Pachad, \"fear\". The title of the sephira Chesed is translated as \"mercy\" or \"love\", and it is often called Gedulah, \"majesty\" or \"magnificence\". Gevurah and Chesed lie on the Pilla rs of Form and Force respectively, and possess a more definite and generally agreed symbolism than any other sephiroth: Chese d stands for expansiveness and the creation and building-up of f orm, what can very appropriately be referred to as anabolism, and Gevurah stands for restraint and both the preservation of f orm, and the breaking-down (or catabolism) of form. Within the symbolism of the Kabbalah the most explicit and concrete expression of form occurs in Malkuth, the physical world, and as it takes a conscious being (e.g. th ee and me) to comprehend the world in terms of forms which are built-up and broken down, so Chesed and Gevurah express somethi ng vital about our conscious relationship with the external, ma terial world. When I see something beautiful being created I ma y well think this is \"good\", but when I see the same thing b eing wantonly destroyed, I would probably think this is \"bad\", an d this type of thinking pervades early Kabbalistic writing. In his commentary on \"The Bahir\", Aryeh Kaplan writes [1]: \"The concept of Chesed-Love is that of freely giving, while that of Gevurah-Strength is that of restraint . When it is said that Strength is restraint, it is in the sense of the teaching \"Who is strong, he who restrains his urge\". It is obvious that man can restrain his nature, but if man can do so, then God certainly can. God's nature, how ever, is to do good and therefore, when He restrains His natu re, the result is evil. The sephira of Gevurah-Strength is t herefore seen as the source of evil.\" The Zohar also contains many references to t he \"rigorous severity\" of God (another synonym for Gevurah) and its being the source of evil in the creation. However, when one considers that the creation and uncontrolled growth of a cancer wo uld correspond to Chesed, and the attempts of the immune system t o contain and destroy it would correspond to Gevurah, it should be clear that it is not useful to consider creation and destructi on in terms of good and evil. It *is* useful to look at a living, organic system as a *balance* between these two opposed tendenc ies, and the manifest Creation in Kabbalah is very definitely p ictured as a living, organic system (i.e. a Tree of Life). The most vivid metaphors for Chesed and Gevura h come from a time when European societies were ruled by kings an d queens, when (in principle at least) the ultimate authority and power in society rested in a single individual. Chesed corr esponds to the creative aspects of leadership, and early texts ar e one-sided in characterising this by love, mercy and maje sty. Gevurah"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"corresponds to the conservative aspects of leader ship, to the power to preserve the status-quo, and the powe r to destroy anything opposed to it. These two aspects go hand- in-hand - try to change anything of consequence in society, and someone will invariably oppose that change. To bring about chan ge it is often necessary to have the power to over-rule opposition . Consensus is an impossibility in society - there will always be someone whose opinions are at best ignored and at worst suppresse d - and Chesed and Gevurah represent respectively the kingly oblig ation to seek what is good for the many (enlightened leadership of course!), and the power to judge and punish those opposed to the will of the king. The following description of Margaret T hatcher comes from Nicholas Ridley, a minister in her cabinet [2] : \"She governed with superb style, carrying ever y war into the enemy's camp, seeking to destroy rather than contain the opposition, and determined to blaze a radical trail. But she never let power corrupt her; nor did she eve r fail to be compassionate and kind as a human being.\" Whether this description is accurate or not is irrelevant to this discussion; what it does do is capture in two sentences something essential about a leader, the balance b etween power, strength and militancy on one hand, and hu manitarianism, compassion and caring on the other. This is very m uch a model of divine kingship (or queenship!): a king who loves and cares for his people and seeks to bring about \"heaven on eart h\", but at the same time punishes transgression, and fights for and preserves what is good and worth preserving. Kabbalists thou ght of God in this way: God loves us (so the argument goes), and the mercy and benignity of God is represented by the sephira Ches ed, but at the same time God has made his laws known to humankind and will judge and punish anyone who opposes these laws. Read the book of Proverbs in the Bible if you want to enter into this view of reality. Many modern Kabbalists have a more jaund iced view of leadership than medieval Kabbalists, and certainl y do not see Chesed as purely the love or mercy of God. In the twentieth century we have seen a succession of leaders harness their vision, creativity and leadership to the four Vic es of Chesed, which are tyranny, bigotry, hypocrisy and glutton y. It takes an uncommon skill and vision not only to con template the annihilation of entire races, but to create a stru cture in which it happens. And how many people would dream of a so cialist utopia where traditional communities are forcibly bulldoze d and replaced by dilapidated concrete slums, and have the power to bring this about? You may not like this kind of leadership, b ut it is still leadership, and in its own way it is inspired. A leader may be inspired by a vision, and may have the power to bri ng that vision into reality, but it is unfortunately also the c ase that the result can become a new definition of evil. Good an d evil are not static qualities with fixed meanings; in every gen eration there are exemplars who define for the whole of society t he meaning of the words in new contexts.

Bigotry is a quick and easy way to dr um up a power base: find a minority group in society, emphasise and magnify to grotesque proportions the differences between them and the rest of society, and use the natural fear of the strange or unfamiliar to do the rest. Hypocrisy can be found in religiou s leaders who denounce normal human behaviour as a sin, sin comp rehensively in private, and use genuine religious aspirations as in excuse to line their pockets. It can be found in those who t alk about the dictatorship of the proletariat in public and buy their luxury goods from exclusive party shops - the colla pse of state socialism in Europe has revealed to those who didn' t already know it the full extent to which pious utterances about social equality were a cover for almost limitless privil eges for the few. Gluttony is over-consumption, an appetite wel l in excess of need, and one has only to remember Imelda Marcos' s wardrobe to get the idea. It is virtually a fashion among mode rn tyrants to siphon billions of dollars into Swiss bank account s - the scale on which men like Idi Amin Dada, Ferdinand Marc os, Baby Doc Duvalier, Mengistu, and Saddam Hussein (to name b ut a few) were able to beggar nations for their own personal adva ntage goes so far beyond any rational measure of human need it is hard to comprehend. When one looks at the worst twentieth century tyrants, men who were directly responsible for the deaths of thousands or millions of people, it is hard to find any Einste ins of evil - one is struck by the sheer ordinariness of these men. Clever, manipulative, politically adept, lucky, excepti onal in their ability to climb to the top of the heap, successfu l in grasping and holding power, but not conscious, plotting allies of a terrible dark power. Behind the brutality, mur der, torture, imprisonment, and the apparatus of oppression one can see a very human vulnerability, self-importance, vanity, foll y, insecurity, and greed. The vices of Chesed are the vices of a ll the other sephiroth writ large - power magnifies a vice until it becomes a ravening monster. A man with rigid and unbending v iews on human morality will do no harm if he has no audience, but give him enough power and he will put society in chains whic h might last a thousand years. A greedy man with enough power m ight loot an entire country. A petty and irrational bigot with enough power might enslave or annihilate whole races. They say p ower corrupts, but this is not so; corruption is already within a ll of us, and we lack only the necessary authority and power to u nleash our own personal evil on the world. The moral is that power needs to be tempered by mercy and love, and the correspondences for Chesed empha sise this so strongly it is easy to for a novice to ignore the appalling negative qualities of Chesed - power with out restraint, indiscriminate destruction, everything in excess. The Virtue of Chesed is humility, the ideal of leadership without self- importance and all its accompanying vices. The Spi ritual Vision of Chesed is the Vision of Love, love and caring f or all living things, and the desire to find a way (be it ever so small - remember humility) to make the world a better place . There is a strong message in the positive correspondences for Chesed: without humility and love, leadership and powe r become the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"instruments of self-importance, and the petty vi ces of human nature are transformed into the monsters of evil wh ich terrorise the human race. The illusion of Chesed is Right, in the sen se of \"being right\". It is difficult to lead without conviction, when one sits on every fence and wavers on every question, but n o-one is ever right with a capital \"R\", and anyone who seeks the reassurance of Being Right is evading the essence of responsibilit y. The qlippoth of Chesed is ideology, not in the philosophical sense, but in the common-use sense of \"political i deology\". The rationale behind this is that it is very easy to ta ke a creed, or a doctrine, or a dogma, or whatever, and use it as a platform for leadership. If you see a politian (or a religious leader) being interviewed on television, and the response to eve ry question is just the same old empty jargon, the same old formu lae, the same old evasions, the same old arguments and irrefutab le assertions, and you feel you have heard the same thing a dozen times before out of a dozen different mouths, then this is the dead, empty shell of leadership. The sephira Gevurah is as often misunderstood as the sephira Chesed. The planet associated with Chesed is ( appropriately) Tzedek, Jupiter, leader of the gods; the planet a ssociated with Gevurah is Madim, Mars, the god of war and des truction. The magical image of Gevurah is a king in a chariot, o r conversely a mighty warrior. Most novices take this imagery at face value and envision Gevurah as a very forceful, violent an d destructive sephira, and cannot understand why it is positioned on the pillar of form. Almost all novices will (wrongly) attribu te the emotion of anger to Gevurah. It is worth recalling from Ch apter 3. the traditional Kabbalistic view [3]: \"It must be remembered that to the Kabbalist, judgement [Din - judgement, a title of Gevurah] means the imposition of limits and the correct determination of things . According to Cordovero the quality of judgement is inherent in everything insofar as everything wishes to remain what it is, to stay within its bounderies.\" This is a statement about *form*. The form of something determines what it *is*, in distinction from everyt hing else, and when it no longer has that form, it no longer *is* . Take a table tennis ball and squash it; it stops being a table tennis ball...it stops being a ball. Something still e xists in the world, but its form *as a ball* has been destroyed . Take these notes and randomly jumble the letters; the letters still exist, but the notes are gone. These notes are contained in the *form* of the letters; destroy the form of the letters and the notes are also destroyed. Everything in the world *is* its form. We ca nnot see the natural substance of the world; we cannot see atom s, and even if we could, we would see protons, neutrons and elec trons arranged in different *forms* to create the chemical elem ents. It has taken physicists most of this century to deduce tha t the protons, neutrons and electrons are not the \"true\" stuff of the world, and underneath there might be \"quarks\", \"leptons\" and \"gluons\""},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"arranged in different *forms* to create the fundamental particles. Is that the end? Are quarks and gluo ns the \"true stuff\", the raw, primal gloop which carries all form? No-one knows. Sometimes I think, in common with the earlie st Kabbalists, that Malkuth sits upon the throne of Binah, and at no point will we find the raw gloop of Malkuth. Someone will w rite down an equation and show the properties of quarks and gluons are a natural consequence of the *form* of the equation, and the form of the equation is one of those things beyond any p ossibility of explanation. \"Look\" we will say, \"The form of al l things is a potential outcome of this one equation. The mother of everything that exists can be written down on a piece of paper . Look, here it is!\" There is a deep mystery in form. The world i s made not of things, but of patterns. In our minds we accept t he reality of these patterns, and forget that the sweet, white s tuff we put in our tea and coffee is just one of an infinite numbe r of patterns of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Carbon is just o ne of a large number of combinations of protons, neutrons and ele ctrons, and so on. We forget that \"War and Peace\" is just one of an infinite number of combinations of letters of the alphabet. The patterns are our reality, and I suspect that *only* the pat terns are real - there is nothing more real than patterns w aiting to be discovered. I have read graduate texts on quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics, and I find no grey gl oop mentioned anywhere. These texts do not explain the world, bu t they predict it, often with astonishing accuracy, and somethin g one does not find is a prediction that the world is founded o n a formless gloop. As a programmer I have built realities out of pure mathematical forms - sets, functions, containers - and nowhere did I need any grey gloop; my worlds were the w ay they were because the objects within them behaved the way t hey did, and that behaviour was simply the structure or form I created. The view of reality in Wittgenstein's \"Tractatus\" [4] has a deeply Kabbalistic (if one-sided) flavour, the Vision of Splendour of Hod in a distilled form: \"If I know an object I also know all its possi ble occurences in states of affairs. (Every one of these possibilities must be part of the nature of the object). A new possibility cannot be discovered later. If I am to know an object, though I need not know its external properties, I must know all its internal properties. If all objects are given, then at the s ame time all *possible* states of affairs are also given. Each thing is, as it were, in a space of poss ible states of affairs. ........ Objects contain the possibility of all situati ons. The possibility of its occuring in states of a ffairs is the *form* of an object.\" (my italics) I have digressed this far into the nature of f orm because I do not believe it is possible to understand eith er Chesed or Gevurah in depth without understanding the importan ce of form in"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Kabbalah, and when talking about form I am not \"talking mystical\". Programmers work with form; they shape p rograms out of forms with the same inquisitive delight as a glassb lower handling a blob of molten glass. They talk about objects, a nd behaviours, and classify objects in hierarchies according to be haviour. They *create* new objects with a given abstract behaviou r; they leave unwanted objects to be tidied up by the \"garbag e collector\". There is much more which can be said about this, but as many people are not programmers and most programmers do not admit to being Kabbalists, I must leave this as a trail to be followed. The important point is that when I talk about form I find similar thinking in chemistry, physics, computer science, and Kabbalah; the world of human beings is perceived in terms of form, and form is created and destroyed. That is what Chesed and Gevurah represent. The sephira Binah is the mother of form. Th at is, Binah contains within her womb the potential of all form, just as woman in the abstract contains within her womb the pote ntial of all babies. The birth of form takes place in Chesed, a nd that is why Chesed corresponds to the visionary; the pre servation and destruction of form takes place in Gevurah, and that is why Gevurah corresponds to the warrior. In most societies even a warrior takes second place to the Law. The Law comes first, and the warrior swears to defend both the Law and the country. This may sound a little i dealistic, but if one takes the trouble to listen to a few oaths of allegiance (e.g. British Police, British Army, Soviet Army) o ne should find that the essence is to obey, uphold and defend. Nothing about violence, destruction, mayem or anger. The essence of Gevurah is to uphold and defend - as Cordovero says, \"th e quality of judgement is inherent in everything insofar as ever ything wishes to remain what it is, to stay within its b ounderies\". If Cordovero had the jargon he might have talked abou t \"the immune system of God\". The Virtues of Gevurah are courage and energy . There is a saying among managers that \"any fool can manage wh en things are going well\". The acid test of management is to hav e the courage to tackle, and essentially destroy, organisations (forms) which no longer work, and to have the energy to keep goi ng against the inevitable opposition. The Vice of Gevurah is crue lty - power is seductive, and destruction can be pleasurable. The spiritual experience of Gevurah is the Vis ion of Power, and the Illusion is invincibility. I don't think t hese need any explanation. The qlippoth of Gevurah is bureaucracy, in t he common-use sense of a system of rules and procedures which has become an end in itself. My most memorable experience was the ti me I went into a social security office to ask whether they could issue me with a social security number. \"You'll have to take a ticket and wait,\" the woman behind the counter said. \"But you only have to tell me yes or no,\" I pr otested. \"You'll have to take a ticket and wait!\" she s napped. So I took a ticket and waited for twenty minutes. When my turn came I asked the question again. \"Can you issue me with a social security numbe r here?\" \"No! Next please!\""},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"This is probably not the best example of the dead hand of bureaucracy at work, as it contains a certa in amount of deliberate cruelty, but we have all encountered endless forms which *have* to be filled in, pointless procedures which *have* to be observed, interminable delays and so on. T he essence of bureaucracy is that there is real power behind it, otherwise we wouldn't suffer the indignities, but the power is locked up and everyone is rendered impotent by the *forms* of bur eaucracy. Gevurah is a hard sephirah to work with, a s Kabbalistic magicians often discover to their cost. There is absolutely no place for emotion, no place for excess, no place for ego. The warrior works within the Law, and ignorance of the Law is not an excuse. If you don't know what the Law is, don 't work with Gevurah. Most people are sloppy in thinking about problems, and take what appears to be the simplest and super ficially most convenient solution. Gevurah is clinically exact, and if you invoke Gevurah you are invoking well above the leve l of emotion, particularly *your* emotions, and as you judge, s o will you be judged. Invoke on the Pillar of Form, and cause a nd effect will follow without the slightest regard for your feelin gs. All good programmers who have sweated throughout the n ight with a programming error of their own making know this in their bones. Associated with Chesed and Gevurah are two ten dencies which are so pronounced, readily observed, and deeply rooted that I have called them the Power myth and the Annihilatio n myth, where I use the word myth in the sense that there is pre-existent, archtypal script in which anyone can play t he role of protagonist. The Power myth features a protagonist who seeks power because power means control. Everything is s pecified and controlled down to the finest detail to eli minate every possibility of discomfort, surprise or insecurit y. The world becomes an impersonal mechanism designed to provi de for every demand. The natural world is destroyed to reduce its unpredictability and untidyness. All knowledge is subverted to control. Personal relationships are restricted and formalised to minimise intrusion or any possibility of personal h urt, and are modelled to increase self-importance. Anyone who w on't play can be removed or suitably punished. The protagonist lives at the centre of the world. In the Annihilation myth the protagonist l ives for the Cause. The Cause is the most important thing in life. The protagonist prays to be released from the thrall of ego and self- importance that he may better serve the Cause with every atom of his soul. \"Yea, I am nothing\", he whispers, \"L ess than the smallest worm in the ground compared with the glory of the Cause. I humble myself before the Cause. I live only to serve the Cause.\" Pain, suffering and death are mere adornm ents for the ever-lasting glory of the Cause. The Cause might b e the Beloved, the Revolution, the Great Work, the Mistress or M aster, or God (to name only a few). Examples of both these myths in practice are legion; two examples are the package-holiday tourist as an ex ample of the Power myth, and many Christian mystics as an ex ample of the Annihilation myth. Both myths can be observed in glorious, infinitely repetitive, and predictable detail in S& M fantasies."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" The God name associated with Chesed is \"El\", or Almighty God. The archangel is Tzadkiel, the \"Righteousnes s of God\". The angel order is the Chashmalim, or Shining Ones. In Ezekiel, Chashmal is a substance which forms the splend our of God's countenance, and as chashmal is the modern Heb rew word for electricity, I find it useful to think of the Chash malim in terms of crackling thunderbolts - it goes well with the Jupiter correspondence. The God name associated with Gevurah is Elohi m Gevor. All the sephiroth on the Pillar of Form use Elohim in their God names, and in this case it is qualified by \"gevor\" , a word which expresses the qualities of a great hero - str ength, might, and courage. The name is sometimes translated as \"God of Battles\". The archangel is is sometimes given as Kamiel, and sometimes as Samael. Samael, the \"Poison of God\" is an angel with a *long* history - see [5], and is essentially the Angel of Death. Samael is not the first choice of angel to invoke when working Gevurah - work on Gevurah is tricky at the best of times, and the Angel of Death does not mess around. Neith er does Kamiel (which I have been told means \"sword of God\" - I c annot confirm this), but there is marginally more scope for inter pretation! The angel order is the Seraphim, or Fiery Serpents. Chesed and Gevurah are the sceptre and sword of a king; there are many statues of medieval kings in Briti sh cathedrals which show a king seated with the sceptre of legiti mate authority in one hand and the sword of temporal might in t he other. In Kabbalah the King corresponds to the sephira Tipher eth, the union of Chesed and Gevurah. This is a symbol of a hu man being in relationship to the world - at the bottom of all i nitiations is the full consciousness that we are kings and que ens with the freedom and power to do anything we please, and total responsibility for the consequences of everyt hing we do.

When on e looks at the progress of the Lightning Flash down the Tree of L ife, then one finds that it follows the path structure connect ing sephiroth *except* when it makes the jump from Binah to Chesed, thus reinforcing this idea of a \"gap\" or \"gulf\" whic h has to be crossed. This notion of an Abyss is extremely old and has found its way into Kabbalah in several different forms, and in the course of time they have all been mixed together in to the notion of \"the Great Abyss\"; the Great Abyss is one of th ose things so necessary that like God, if it didn't already exi st, it would have to be invented. One of the earliest sources for the Abyss co mes from the Bible: \"And the earth was without form, and void; an d darkness was upon the face of the deep.\" Kabbalists adopted this view that there was a tim e before the creation characterised by Tohu and Bohu, name ly Chaos and Emptiness [1]. Another idea mentioned several time s in the Zohar [2] is that there were several failed attempts at creation *before* the present one; these attempts failed bec ause mercy and judgement (e.g. force and form) were not balan ced, and the resulting detritus of these failed attempts, the br oken shells of previous sephiroth, accumulated in the Abyss. Beca use the shells (Qlippoth) were the result of unbalanced rigour or judgement they were considered evil, and the Abyss became a repos itory of evil spirits not dissimilar from the pit of Hell in to which the rebellious angels were cast, or the rebellious Ti tans in Greek mythology who were buried as far beneath the Earth as the Earth is beneath the sky. Another theme which contributed to the notion of the Abyss was the legend of the Fall. According to th e Kabbalistic interpretation of the Biblical myth, at the conclus ion of the act of Creation there was a pure state, denoted by Ede n, where the primordial Adam-and-Eve-conjoined existed in a sta te of divine perfection. There are various esoteric interpreta tions of what the Fall represents, but all agree that after t he Fall Eden became inaccessible and Adam and Eve were separate d and took on bodies of flesh here in the material world. T his theme of separation from God and exile in a world of ma tter (and by extension, limitation, finiteness, pain, suffer ing, death - manifestations of the rigours or evil inherent in God) precedes Kabbalah and can be found in the Gnostic legend of Sophia exiled in matter. This idea of separation or exile from di vinity mirrors very closely the use of the Abyss on the modern Tr ee to divide the sephiroth representing a human being from the sephiroth representing God. Isaac Luria (1534 -1572) introduced a new ele ment into the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"notion of the Abyss with his idea of \"tzimtzum\" or contraction. Luria wondered how it was possible for the hidden God (En Soph) to create something out of nothing if there wasn't any nothing to begin with. If the En Soph (no-end, the infinite) is everywhere then how can we be distinct from the En-Soph? Luri a argued that creation was possible because a contraction in the En Soph had created an emptiness where God was not, that En So ph had chosen to limit itself by a withdrawal, and this sho wed that the principle of self-limitation was a necessary precursor to creation; not only did this explain why the Creati on is separate from the hidden God, but it emphasised that l imitation was inherent in creation from the very beginning. Limitation, finiteness, the separation of one thing from anoth er, what early Kabbalists referred to as the severity or \"strict judgement\" of God (what modern Kabbalists call \"form\") was a puz zling quality to introduce into the Creation given that it is t he source of suffering and evil in the impersonal sense, what Dion Fortune calls \"negative evil\" [3]. Luria's notion of tsimt sum suggested that there was no possibility of creation wit hout it, and provided a rather abstract explanation to one of the most persistent questions of all time, namely: \"if God made the world and God is good, how come he made mosquitoes?\". Pull together the various ideas of the Great Abyss and one ends up with a sort of vast, initially empty arena like a Roman amphitheatre where the drama of the Creation was enacted. The mysterious En Soph played a brief role as direc tor from the imperial box, only to retire behind a veil at the conclusion of the performance leaving behind a huge power cord sn aking in from the unknown region beyond the arena, and plugged-i n to a socket at the rear of the sephira Kether. The lights of the sephiroth blaze out and illuminate the centre of this vast ar ena; this is Olam Ha-Nekudoth, \"The World of Point Lights\". At the periphery of the arena far from the lights of manifestation t here is a deep darkness where all the cast-off detritus and spoil of the creation was deposited by weary angels and left to rot. A strange life lives there. The situation was more-or-less as described a bove when in 1909 Aleister Crowley decided to \"cross the Abyss\" and added to the mythology of the Abyss with the following descr iption [4]: \"The name of the Dweller in the Abyss is Choro nzon, but he is not really an individual. The Abyss is empt y of being; it is filled with all possible forms, each equal ly inane, each therefore evil in the only true sense of the w ord - that is, meaningless but malignant, in so far as it cr aves to become real. These forms swirl senselessly into ha phazard heaps like dust devils, and each chance aggregation asserts itself to be an individual and shrieks `I am I!' tho ugh aware all the time that its elements have no true bond; so that the slightest disturbance dissipates the delusio n just as a horseman, meeting a dust devil, brings it in s howers of sand to the earth.\" I was struck when reading this by the simil arity between Crowley's description above and the section on Hod and Netzach in which I described the chaos of a personality und er the control of the \"hosts\" or \"armies\" of those two sephira, w here a host of"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"forms of behaviour compete for the right to be \"m e\". Crowley's experience has far more in common with the rending of the Veil of Paroketh separating Yesod and Tiphereth, and furth er comments by Crowley add weight to this: \"As soon as I had destroyed my personality, as soon as I had expelled my ego, the universe to which it was indeed a frightful and fatal force, fraught with every form of fear, was only so in relation to the idea `I'; so lo ng as `I am I' all else must seem hostile. Now that there was no longer any `I' to suffer, all these ideas which had infli cted suffering became innocent. I could praise the perfect ion of every part; I could wonder and worship the whole.\" This is a very recognisable description of someone who has been released from the demon of the false self and th e imprisoning triad of Hod, Netzach and Yesod, and moved throug h the Paroketh towards Tiphereth. Crowley's experience is valid as it stands, but what it might mean to \"cross the Abyss\", and th e absurdity of Crowley's belief that he had achieved this, will b e examined in the following section on Binah and Chokhmah. A twentieth-century Kabbalist who did succe ed in adding something useful to the ever-expanding notion of t he Abyss was Dion Fortune, in her theosophical work \"The Cosmic Doctrine\" [3]. The form of this work appears to have been inspired by Blavatsky's \"The Secret Doctrine\", and certainly lives up to Fortune's claim that it was \"designed to train the mind, not to inform it.\" Fortune describes three processes arising out of the Unmanifest (i.e. En Soph). Ring Cosmos is an ana bolic process underlying the creation of forms of greater and greater complexity. Ring Chaos is a catabolic process u nderlying the destruction and recycling of form. Ring-Pass-Not is a limit where catabolism turns back into anabolism. She visual ised this as three great rings of movement in the Unmanifest, w ith the motion associated with Ring Cosmos spiralling towards the centre, the movement of Ring Chaos unwinding towards the perip hery, and the dead-zone of Ring-Pass-Not defining the outer limit of Ring Chaos as an abyss of unbeing, a cosmic compost heap w here form is digested under the dominion of the Angel of Death a nd turned into something fertile where new growth can take place. The similarity between Fortune's description of Ring Chaos and what in programming is called a \"reference-cou nting garbage collector\" is remarkable, given that she was writin g in the 30's. Many programming languages allow new programming st ructures to be created dynamically, thus allowing the creation of more and more complex structures. At the same time there is a mechanism to reclaim unused resources so that the system does n ot run out of memory or disc space, and the normal scheme i s that if a structure is not referenced by any other structure, recycle it. In Fortune's language, if you want to destroy s omething, you \"make a vacuum round it (i.e. remove all references ). You prevent opposition from touching it. Then, being unopposed, it is free to follow the laws of its own nature, which is to join the motion of Ring Chaos.\" \"Cosmic Doctrine\" is a valiant attempt to say something quite profound; at an intellectual level it fails \"abysmally\","},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"and I cannot read it without squirming, but it stil l has more raw Kabbalistic and magical insight at an intuitive le vel than just about anything else I have read. The idea of a cos mic reference- counting garbage collection process and an abyss of unbeing which is not so much a state as a process of unbecoming is something not easily forgotten once touched. A final example of an abyss is one which diff ers from the previous examples in that it brings to the fore the relationship between us, the created, and the Unmanifest, the E n Soph itself. Kabbalistic writers agree that the Unmanifest is no t nothing; on the contrary, it is the hidden wellspring of being , but as it is \"not manifest being\" it combines the words \"not\" an d \"being\" in a conjuction which can be apprehended as a kind of a byss. Scholem [6] discusses this \"nothingness\" as follows: \"The primary start or wrench in which the intr ospective God is externalised and the light that shines inwardly made visible, this revolution of perspective, trans forms En Soph, the inexpressible fullness, into nothingness. It is in this mystical \"nothingness\" from which all the oth er stages of God's gradual enfolding in the Sefiroth emanat e, and which the kabbalists call the highest Sefira, or the \"supreme crown\" of Divinity. To use another metaphor, i t is the abyss which becomes visible in the gaps of ex istence. Some Kabbalists who have developed this idea, for instance Rabbi Joseph ben Shalom of Barcelona (1300), main tain that in every transformation of reality, in every chan ge of form, or every time the status of a thing is altered, the abyss of nothingness is crossed and for a fleeting my stical moment becomes visible.\" It should be clear by now that the Abyss is a metaphor for a number of intuitions or experiences. I do not k now how many different kinds of abyss there are, but the re are some distinctions which can be made: - the Abyss of nothingness - the Abyss of separation - the Abyss of knowledge - the Abyss of un-being (or un-becoming) The perception that being and nothingness go ha nd-in-hand is something Sartre studied in great depth [7], and many of his observations on the nature of consciousne ss and its relatationship to negation or nothingness are am ong the most perceptive I have found. His arguments are lengthy and complex, and I do not wish to summarise them here other tha n to say that he viewed nothingness as the necessary consequence of a special kind of being he calls \"being-for-itself\", the kin d of being we experience as self-conscious human beings. The Abyss of separation can be experienced as a separation from the divine, but it can also be experienced qu ite acutely in one's relationships with others and with the p hysical world"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"itself. Much of what we perceive about the world an d other people is an illusion created by the machinery of percepti on; strip away the trick, Yesod becomes Daath, and a yawning ab yss opens up where one is conscious less of what one knows than of what one does not; it is possible to look at a close fr iend and see something more alien, remote and unknown than th e surface of Pluto. This experience is closely related to the Abyss of knowledge, which is discussed in more detail in the discussion on Daath below. The Abyss of un-being is the direct perceptio n that at any instant it is possible to not-be. This perception g oes beyond the contemplation or awareness of physical death; it is the direct apprehension of what Dion Fortune calls \"Ring Chao s\", that un- being is less a state than a process, that at every instant there is an impulse, a magnetic attraction towards total self- annihilation on every level possible. The clos er one moves towards the roots of being, the closer one moves towards the roots of un-being. Daath means \"Knowledge\". In early Kabbalah Daath was a symbol of the union of Wisdom (Chokhmah) and Understanding (Binah). The book of Proverbs is rich mine of material on the nature of these three qualities, material whi ch forms the basis of many ideas in the Zohar and other Kabba listic texts; e.g. Proverbs 3.13: \"Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding....She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one t hat retaineth her. The Lord by wisdom hath founded t he earth; by understanding hath he founded the heavens. By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew\" And Proverbs 24.3: \"Through wisdom is an house builded; and by un derstanding is it established: And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all pleasant and precious riches.\" In the \"Bahir\" [8] and \"Zohar\" [e.g. 2] Daath r epresents the symbolic union of wisdom and understanding, and is their offspring or child. As the Microprosopus, often symbolised by Tiphereth, is also the symbolic child of Chokhma h and Binah, there is some room for confusion. According to the Zohar however, Daath has a specific location in the Microprosopus, namely in one of the three chambers of the brain, from where it mediates between the higher (Chokhmah and Binah) and the lo wer (the six sephiroth or \"chambers\" of the Microprosopus - see the reference to Proverbs 24.3 above). I have often puzzled as to why knowledge is the natural outcome of wisdom and understanding. It was only r ecently when I read Proverbs that I realised that wisdom was bein g used in the sense of something *external*, something which is received from someone else. As children we were told \"do this\" or \"don't do that\", and often couldn't question the wisdom o f the advice because we lacked the understanding. I once had a furious row"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"with my father about building a liquid fuel rocket engine in the house using petrol and hydrogen peroxide. He flat ly refused to let me do it. I couldn't understand the problem - I was going to be careful. I now *know*, because I *understand* th e stupidity of what I was trying to do, the *wisdom* of his refu sal. Received wisdom cannot be integrated into oneself unless there is the capacity to understand it, and having understood, i t becomes real knowledge which can be passed on again as wisdom to someone else. For early Kabbalists the ultimate wisdom was the wi sdom of God as expressed in the Torah, and by attempting to un derstand this wisdom (and that is what Kabbalah was) they could arrive at the only knowledge truely worth having. Knowledge of God was the union between the higher and lower, and perhaps thi s is why Daath was never a sephiroth, something which manifest s positively; since the Fall that knowledge has been lost. One of the unattributable pieces of Kabbalah I was taught was that Daath is the hole left behind when Malkuth fell out of the G arden of Eden. If you examine my derivation of the Tree of Life i n Chapter 1. closely you will see that I have based some of it on this very astute observation. The notion of Daath as a \"hole\" appears to ha ve originated this century. Gareth Knight, for example [9], provi des a complete set of correspondences for Daath, many of which happen to be negative Tiphereth correspondences or misplaced c orrespondences borrowed from other sephiroth, but one at least is appropriate: he gives the magical image of Daath as Janus, god of doorways. Kenneth Grant [10], with his usual florid imaginati on, sees Daath as a gateway through to \"outer spaces beyond, or be hind, the Tree itself\" dominated by Qlippothic forces. There is a deep correspondence between seph iroth in the lower face of the Tree and sephiroth in the upper f ace: look at the symmetry of the Tree and you should see why Malkuth, Tiphereth and Kether are linked, why Hod and Bina h are linked, why Chokhmah and Netzach are linked, and most impor tantly for the purposes of this discussion, that there is a correspondence between Yesod and Daath. These are not just sim ple geometric symmetries; they express some important relationsh ips which are experientially verifiable, and in terms of what ma kes most sense in Kabbalah and what does not, these relationships are important. Daath and Yesod, at different levels, are like tw o sides of the same coin. Jam the machinery of perception I sai d above, and Yesod can become Daath. The following quotation is taken from an bona-fide anthropological article [11] attempting t o explain some of the characteristic features of cave art: \"Moving into a yet deeper stage of tran ce is often accompanied, according to laboratory repo rts, by an experience of a vortex or rotating tunnel t hat seems to surround the subject. The external world is progressively excluded and the inner world grows more f lorid. Iconic images may appear on the walls of the vortex, often imposed on a lattice of squares, like television scree ns. Frequently there is a mixture of iconic and geom etric forms. Experienced shamans are able to plunge rapid ly into deep trance, where they manipulate the imagery acc ording to the needs of the situation. Their experience of i t, however, is of a world they have come briefly to inhabit; not a world of"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" their own making, but a spirit world they are privileged to visit.\" This will come as no surprise to anyone who has read Michael Harner's \"The Way of the Shaman\" [5]. There on page 103 (plate 8) is a beautiful picture of the tunnel vortex, complete with prisms. When I first saw this picture I was a stonished and recognised it instantly, prisms and all; when I s howed it to my wife her reaction was the same. The tunnel vortex appears to be one of the constants of magical/mystical experi ence, and it appears in a very precise context. In Kabbalah the shamanic tunnel would be attributed to the 32nd. path conne cting Malkuth to Yesod; this path connects the real world to the underworld of the imagination and the unconscious, and is common ly symbolised by a tunnel [eg.9]. However, using the symmetry of the Tree, this path also corresponds to the path at another lev el connecting Tiphereth across the Abyss, through Daath, to Kether. The tunnel/vortex at this level is no longer subjective , because this level of the Tree corresponds to the noum enal reality underpinning the phenomenal world, and links ind ividual self- consciousness to something greater. Just as Yesod represents the machinery of sense perception, so Daath can flip o ver to become the Yesod of another level of perception, not sens e perception, but something completely different that seems to o perate out of the \"back door\" of the mind; this is objective kn owledge, what used to be called gnosis. To conclude this section on Daath and the Abys s, it is worth asking what the relationship between the two ide as is. As I programmer I am continually aware of the gulf bet ween abstract ideas, such as the number two and its physical repr esentations in the world: 2, II, .., two etc. The number two can be represented in an infinite number of ways, and it is only when you share some understanding of my language that you can *begin* t o guess that a particular mark in the world represents the num ber two. The situation is even worse than it might seem; a bas ic theorem of information theory states that the optimum way of e xpressing any piece of information is one where the symbols occ ur completely randomly. I could take this paragraph, pass it thro ugh an optimal text compressor and the same piece of tex t would be indistinguishable from random garbage. Only I, knowing the compression procedure, could extract the original message from the result. Whatever we call information appe ars to exist independently of the physical world, and uses the world of chalk marks, ink marks, magnetic domains or whatever lik e a rider uses a horse. To me, the gulf is irreconcilable; betwee n the physical world and the world of the mind is an abyss, a nd I am not indulging in \"new physics\" or anything vaguely susp ect - this is meat and drink to the average progammer, who spend s most of his or her time transforming abstractions from one s ymbol set to another. To take a slightly different approach, there is a mathematical proof that there is no largest prime n umber. I know that proof. No dissection of my brain will ever re veal the proof to someone who does not know it. I am prepared to bet a large quantity of alcohol that it is theoretically impossible to discover; the proof that there is no largest prim e number will never be extracted even if you assume a neurologis t capable of"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"mapping every atom in my brain. Evolution t ends towards optimality, and I think the proof will be encoded optimally to look like random garbage. There is an abyss he re; there is knowledge which can never be attained. In K abbalah this particular abyss is called the abyss of Assiah; it is the first in a series of abysses. The next abyss is the abys s of Yetzirah, and it is this abyss I have been discussing for most of this section. There are further abysses, and this shou ld be clearer when I discuss the Four Worlds and the Extended Tre e. The Abyss and Daath go together because the Abyss sets a limi t on what can be *known* from below the Abyss; the abyss is an abyss of knowledge, and Daath is the hole we fall into when we try probe beyond. Can the nature of God be expressed in term s of anything human? No. God is as human as a cockroach, as huma n as a lump of stone, as human as a star, as human as empty spac e. So how can you *know* anything about God? Only when Daath f lips over to become the Yesod of another world can you *know* anything, but unfortunately the fiery speech of angels is lik e leprecaun's gold: by the time you've taken it home to show to your friends, you've nothing but a purse of dried leaves.

H. Lawrence The triad of Binah, Chokmah and Kether are a Kabbalistic representation of the manifest God. A discussion on this triad presents me with a problem. The problem is that whi le I have used the word \"God\" in many places in these notes, I hav e done so with a sense of unease, understanding that the word m eans so many different things to so many people that it i s effectively meaningless. I have chosen to use the word as a pl aceholder for personal experience, with the implicit assumption t hat the reader understands that \"God\" *is* a personal experience, and not an ill-defined abstraction one \"believes in\". My view is not novel, but there are still many people who are uncomforta ble with the idea of experiencing (as opposed to \"believing in\") God. A second assumption implicit in the use of the word \"God\" as a placeholder is that it stands *only* for experience; your ex perience, and hence your God, is as valid as mine, and as there are no formal definitions, there is no scope for theological deba te or dispute. This leaves me with nothing more to say. However.....these notes were intended to provide some insight into Kabbalah, and it would be odd, having begun to write them, to then turn around and say \"sorry, I won't say anything about the three supernal sephiroth\". I think I have to say something. Balanced against this is my original intention, at every stage in these notes, to relate the objects of discussion to something real, to make a personal contribution by adding my own understanding to the subject rather than simpl y pot-boiling the same old material. I cannot see how to put fle sh on the bare bones of the supernal sephiroth without discu ssing my own conception of God and whatever personal experience I might have. I am loth to do this. For a start, it isn't fair o n those people who study and use Kabbalah (many Jewish) who do not share my views, and secondly, remembering the parable of the blind men and the elephant, impressions of God tend to be shape d by the part"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"one grabs hold of, and how close to the bum end on e is standing. Like it or not, my explanations of the super nal sephiroth are going to be lacking in substance. I can only ask you, the reader, to accept that the primary purpose of Kabba lah has always been the direct, personal experience of the living God, a state Kabbalists have called \"devekuth\", or cleaving to God, and the way towards that experience comes, not from a studious examination of the symbolism of the supernals, but from the practical techniques of Kabbalah to be discussed in a later chapter. The title of the sephira Binah is t ranslated as \"understanding\", and sometimes as \"intelligence\". The title of the sephira Chokmah translates as \"wisdom\", and th at of Kether translates as \"crown\". These three sephiroth are o ften referred to as the supernal sephiroth, or simply the supern als, and they represent that aspect of God which is manifest in c reation. There is another aspect of God in Kabbalah, the \"real Go d\" or En Soph; although En Soph is responsible for the creation of the universe, En Soph manifests to us only in the limited form o f the sephira Kether. An enormous amount of effort has gone into \"explaining\" this process: one book on Kabbalah [1] in my posse ssion devotes eight pages to the En Soph, twelve pages to the su pernal trio of Kether, Chokmah and Binah, and five pages to the r emaining seven sephiroth, a proportion which seems relativ ely constant throughout Kabbalistic literature. Briefly, the hidden God or En Soph crystall ised a point which is the sephira Kether. In most versions (and this idea can be found as far back as the \"Bahir\" [2]) the En Sop h \"contracted\" (tsimtsum) to \"make room\" for the creation, and th e crystallised point of Kether manifested within this \"space\". K ether is the seed planted in nothingness from which the creation springs - an interesting metaphor turns the Tree of Life \"upsi de down\" and shows Kether at the bottom of the Tree, rooted in t he soil of the En Soph, with the rest of the sephiroth formin g the trunk, branches and leaves. Another metaphor shows Kether connected to the En Soph by a \"thread of light\", a metaphor I used somewhat whimsically in the section on \"Daath and the Aby ss\", where I portrayed the Tree of Life as a lit-up Christmas tree with a power cord snaking out of the darkness of the En So ph and through the abyss to Kether. Like the Moon, Kether has two aspects: manifest and hidden, and for this reason its magi cal image is that of a face seen in profile: one side of the fa ce (the right side, as it happens) is visible to us, but the o ther side is turned forever towards the En Soph. Kether has many titles: Existence of Existenc es, Concealed of the Concealed, Ancient of Ancients, Anci ent of Days, Primordial Point, the Smooth Point, the Point with in the Circle, the Most High, the Inscrutable Height, the Vast Cou ntenance (Arik Anpin), the White Head, the Head which is not, Macroprosopus. Taken together, these titles imply that Kether is the first, the oldest, the root of existence, remote, and its most accurate symbol is that of a point. Kether precedes all forms of existence, all differentiation and distinction, all polarity. Kether contains everything in potential, like a see d that sprouts and grows into a Tree, not once, but continuously. Kether is both root and seed. Because it precedes all forms and contains all"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"opposites it is not *like* anything. You can say it contains infinite goodness, but then you have to say that it contains infinite evil. Wrapped up in Kether is all the love in the world, and wrapped around the love is all the hate. Kether is an outpouring of purest, radiant light, but equall y it is the profoundest stygian dark. And it is none of thes e things; it precedes all form or polarity, and its Virtue is u nity. It is a point without extension or qualities, but it contains all creation within it as an unformed potential. The \"Zohar\" [3] is packed with references to K ether, and it is difficult to be selective, but the following q uote from the \"Lesser Holy Assembly\", is clear, simple, and subtl e: \"He (Kether) hath been formed, and yet as it were He hath not been formed. He hath been conformed so that he may sustain all things; yet is He not formed, see ing that He is not discovered. When He is conformed He produceth nine Lights, which shine forth from Him, from his conformation. And from Himself those Lights shine forth, a nd they emit flames, and they rush forth and are extended on every side, like as from an elevated lantern the rays of light stream down on every side. And those rays of light, which are extended, when anyone draweth near unto them so that they may be exa mined, are not found, and there is only the lantern alone.\" Polarity is contained within Kether in the form of Chokmah and Binah, the Wisdom and Understanding of God, and K abbalists have represented this polarity using the most obvious of metaphors, that of male and female. Chokmah is Abba, the Fat her, and Binah is Aima, the Mother, and the entire world is seen a s the child of the continuous and never-ending coupling of this di vine pair. The following passage is taken again from the \"Lesser H oly Assembly\": \"Come and behold. When the Most Holy Anci ent One, the Concealed with all Concealments (Kether), d esired to be formed forth, He conformed all things under th e form of Male and Female; and in such place wherein Male a nd Female are comprehended. For they could not permanently exist save in a nother aspect of the Male and Female (their countenances being joined together). And this Wisdom (Chokmah) embracing all thi ngs, when it goeth forth and shineth forth from the Most Holy Ancient One, shineth not save under the form of Male and Female. Therefore is this Wisdom extended, and it is found that it equally becometh Male and Female. ChKMH AB BINH AM: Chokmah is the Father and Binah is the Mother, and therein are Chokmah, Wisdom , and Binah, Understanding, counterbalanced together in th e most perfect"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" equality of Male and Female. And therefore are all things established in th e equality of Male and Female, for were it not so, how could they subsist! This beginning is the Father of all things; the Father of all Fathers; and both are mutually bound toge ther, and the one path shineth into the other - Chokmah, Wi sdom, as the Father; Binah, Understanding, as the Mother. It is written, Prov. 2.3: 'If thou calle st Binah the Mother.\" When They are associated together They gener ate, and are expanded in truth. And concerning the continuing act of procreation: \"Together They (Chokmah & Binah) go forth, tog ether They are at rest; the one ceaseth not from the other, and the one is never taken away from the other. And therefore is it written, Gen 2.10: 'And a river went forth from Eden' - i.e. properly speaking, i t continually goeth forth and never faileth.\" A river or spring metaphor is often used for Chokmah, to emphasise the continuous nature of creation. The pr imary metaphor is that of a phallus - Chokmah is the phallus whi ch ejaculates continuously into the womb of Binah, and Binah i n turn gives birth to phenomenal reality. Phallic symbols - a s tanding stone, a fireman's hose, a fountain, a spear etc, belong t o Chokmah, and womb symbols - a cauldron, a gourd, a chalice, an oven etc, belong to Binah. In an abstract sense, Chokm ah and Binah correspond to the first, primal manifestation of t he polarity of force and form. To repeat a metaphor I have use d previously, Binah is a hot-air balloon, and Chokmah is the roa ring blast of flame which keeps it in the air. The metaphor is n ot completely accurate: Binah is not form, but she is the Mother of Form - she creates the condition whereby form can manifest. The colour of Binah is black, and she is as sociated with Shabbatai (\"rest\"), the planet Saturn. The symboli sm of Binah is twofold: on one hand she is Aima, the fertile mothe r of creation, and on the other hand she is the mother of finiteness, limitation, restriction, boundaries, time, space, law, fate, and ultimately, death; in this form she is often depic ted as Ama the Crone, who broods (like many pictures of Queen Vic toria) in her black widow's weeds on the throne of creation - one of the titles of Binah is Khorsia, the Throne. The magician and Kabbalist Dion Fortune ha d a strongly intuitive grasp of Binah, not just as a sphere of a particular kind of emanation, but as the Great Mother her self, as the following rhyme from her novel \"Moon Magic\" [4] sho ws: \"I am she who ere the earth was formed Was Rhea, Binah, Ge. I am that soundless, boundless, bitter sea"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" Out of whose deeps life wells eternally. Astarte, Aphrodite, Ashtoreth - Giver of life and bringer in of death; Hera in heaven, on earth Persephone; Diana of the ways, and Hecate - All these am I, and they are seen in me. The hour of the high full moon draws near; I hear the invoking words, hear and appear - Shaddai El Chai and Rhea, Binah, Ge - I come unto the priest who calleth me - \" One of the oldest correspondences for Binah is th e element of water, and she is called Marah, the bitter sea f rom which all life comes and must return. She is also the Superi or or Greater Mother; the Inferior or Lesser Mother is the sephir a Malkuth, who is better symbolised by nature goddesses of the ea rth itself - e.g. the trinity of Kore, Demeter, and Persephon e. The Tree of Life has many goddess symbols, and it is not alway s easy to see where they fit: Binah is the Great Mother of All, with symbo ls of space, time, fate, spinning, weaving, cauldrons etc. Malkuth is the Earth as the soil from which life springs, matter as the basis for life, the spirit concealed in matter, best symbolised by goddesses of this earth, fertility, vegetation etc. Yesod in its lunar aspect is the Moon, a hidde n reality with the ebb and flow of secret tides, illusion, g lamour, sexual reproduction etc, and is sometimes in invoked in the form of lunar goddesses - Selene, Artemis etc. Gevurah is on the Pillar of Form; the whole Pillar has a female aspect, and Gevurah is sometimes invok ed in a female form as Kali, Durga, Hecate, or the Morriga n, although it must be said that all four goddesses also s hare definite Binah-type correspondences. Netzach has the planet Venus as a corresponde nce, and its aspect of sensual pleasure, luxury, sexual l ove and desire is sometime invoked through a goddess such as Venus or Aphrodite. The Spiritual Experience of Binah is the Visi on of Sorrow: as the Mother of Form Binah is also the Mother of f initeness and limitation, of determinism, of cause and effect. Every quality comes forth hand-in-hand with its opposite: life a nd death, joy and despair, love and hate, order and chaos, so that it is not possible to find an anchor in life. For every rea son to live I can find you, buried like a worm in an apple, a reason not to live; the Vision of Sorrow is a vision of a life condemned to tramp along the circumference of a circle while for ever denied a view of the unity of the centre. At its most extrem e the creation is seen as an evil trick played by a malign demiu rge, a sick, empty joke, or a joyless prison with death the onl y release. The classic vision of sorrow is that of Siddhartha Gautama, but"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Tolstoy records [5] a terrible and enduring psych ic experience which contains most of the elements associated wi th the worst Binah can offer - it drove him to the very edge of suicide. The Illusion of Binah is death; that is, the v ision of Binah may be compelling, but it is one-sided, a half-tr uth, and the finiteness it reveals is an illusion. Our own perso nal finiteness is an illusion. The Qlippoth of Binah is fatalism, the belie f that we are imprisoned in the mechanical causality of form, an d not only are we incapable of changing or achieving anything, b ut even if we could, there wouldn't be any point. Why try to be happy - happiness leads inexorably to sadness. Why try to build and create - it all ends in decay and ruin soon enough. As the author of \"Ecclesiastes\" says, all is vanity. The Vice of Binah is avarice. Form is only on e-half of the equation of life - change is the other half - an d to try to hold onto and preserve form at the expense of chang e would be the death of all life. The Virtue of Binah is silence. Beyond form there are no concepts, ideas, abstractions, or word s. The Spiritual Experience of Chokmah is the V ision of God Face-to-Face. The tradition I received has it tha t one cannot have this vision while incarnate i.e. one dies in the process. One Hasidic Rabbi liked to bid farewell to his family each morning as if it was his last - he feared he might die of ecstacy during the day. In the \"Greater Holy Assembly\" [3] , three Rabbis pass away in ecstacy, and in the \"Lesser Holy Asse mbly\" [3] the famous Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai passes away at th e conclusion. There is a fairly widespread belief that to look on the naked face of God, or a God, means death, but fortunate ly there is no historical evidence to suggest that the majority of Kabbalists died of anything other than natural causes. Having said that, I would not like to underplay the naked rawness of Chokmah; unconstrained, unconfined, free of form, it is the creative power which sustains the universe, and talk of d eath is not melodramatic. The Illusion of Chokmah is independence; at the level of Binah we seem to be locked in form, separate and fi nite, but just as death is seen to be an illusion so ultim ately is our independence and free-will. We *seem* to be indepe ndent, and we *seem* to have free-will, but at the level of Chokm ah we draw our water from the same well. The Virtue of Chokmah is good, and the V ice is evil. Regardless of your definition of good or e vil, Chokmah encompasses every possibility of action, circ umstance and creation, and modern Kabbalists no longer try to b elieve God is good, and evil must reside elsewhere. Medieval Ka bbalists liked to hedge their bets, but one has only to plumb t he bottomless depths of personal good and evil to find they spr ing from the same place. The Qlippoth of Chokmah is arbitrariness. The raw, creative, unconstrained energy of God at its most primal and dynamic can seem utterly arbitrary and chaotic, and some autho rs [e.g. [6]] have seen it this way. This removes the \"divine w ill\" from the energy and leaves a blind, directionless and essentially mechanical force which is unbiased - creation and destruction, order and chaos, who cares? The Kabbalistic view i s that this is"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"not so: Chokmah contains form (as Binah) *in poten tial*, and it is not correct to view Chokmah as a purely chaotic energy. It is an energy biased towards an end - \"God's Will\", f or lack of a better description. The Spiritual Experience of Kether is Union with God. My comments on the Spiritual Experience of Chokmah a pply also to Kether. The Illusion of Kether is attainment. We ca n live, we can change, but there is nothing to attain. Even Union with God is no attainment; we were always one with God, and *kno wing* that we are changes nothing of any consequence - as long as we live, there is no goal in life other than living it self. As the Kabbalist Rebbe Nachman of Breslov said [7]: \"No matter how high one reaches, there is st ill the next step. Therefore, we never know anything, an d still do not attain the true goal. This is a very deep a nd mysterious concept.\" The Qlippoth of Kether is Futility. Perhaps the c reation was a bad idea. Maybe the En Soph should never have emana ted the point- crown of Kether. Perhaps the whole of creation, lif e, the entire, ghastly three-ring circus we are forced to endure i s nothing more than *a complete waste*. The En Soph should suck Malkuth back into Kether, collapse the whole, crazy house of ca rds, and admit the mistake. The God-name of Binah is Elohim, a feminine noun with a masculine plural ending. When we read in the B ible \"In the beginning created God...\", this God is Elohim. The name Elohim is associated with all the sephiroth on the Pillar of Form, and is taken to represent the feminine aspect of God. Th e God-name of Chokmah is Yah (YH), a shortened form of YHVH. Th e God-name of Kether is Eheieh, a name sometimes translated as \"I am\", and more often as \"I will be\". The archangel of Binah is Tzaphqiel; I have b een told this means \"Shroud of God\", but I have not been able to verify this. If it does not mean \"Shroud of God\", it most cert ainly should. The archangel of Chokmah is Ratziel, the Herald o f the Deity. According to tradition, the wisdom of God and the d eepest secrets of the creation were inscribed on a sapphire whic h is in the keeping of the archangel Ratziel, and this \"Book o f Ratziel\" was given to Adam and handed down through the generati ons [8]. The archangel of Kether is Metatron, the Archangel of the Presence. According to tradition Metatron was once the man En och, who was so wise he was taken by God and made a prince among the angels. The angel orders of Binah, Chokmah and Kether can be derived directly from the vision of Ezekiel. In the B iblical text, Ezekiel describes successively the Holy Living C reatures, the great wheels within wheels, and lastly the throne-chariot (Merkabah) of God. The vision of Ezekiel had a grea t influence on early Kabbalah, and it is no coincidence that the angel order of Binah is the Aralim, or Thrones, the angel order of Chokmah is the Auphanim or Wheels, and the angel order of K ether is the Chiaoth ha Qadesh, or Holy Living Creatures. The forms of the Chiaoth ha Qadesh - lion, eagle, man and ox - hav e survived to this day in many Christian churches, and can be found on the"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"\"World\" card of most Tarot packs. It is difficult to grasp the nature of Chokm ah and Binah from symbols alone, just as it is difficult to gras p interstellar distances, the energy output of a star, the number of stars in a galaxy, and the number of galaxies visible to us. The scale of the observable physical universe relative to our pl anet (and the planet is a big place for most of us) is staggeri ng; there are something like a hundred stars in *our galaxy alon e* for every person on this planet. When I think of Chokmah and Binah I attempt to think of them on this scale; the phys ical universe where we have our home, considered as Malku th, is vast, mysterious, and contains inconceivable energies - t o consider the Father and Mother of creation on any less a scale s eems arrogant to me. Which brings me to the question \"Can one exp erience, or be initiated into, the supernal sephiroth?\". If the Kabbalah is to be considered as based o n experience, and not an intellectual construction, then the ans wer has to be \"yes\". The supernals represent something real. What do they represent? Is it possible to \"cross the Abyss\"? T he answers to these questions depends on which Kabbalistic model one chooses to use, and precisely how one interprets the Tree of Life. For the sake of argument I have chosen three alternative mo dels: Model A: the sephira Malkuth represents the w hole physical universe; the sephiroth from Yesod to Chesed (the Microprosopus) represent a sentient, self-conscious being; the supernals represent the God of the whole universe, God-in-the-Large. Model B: the Tree of Life is a model of human cons ciousness; the supernals represent the God within, God-i n-the-Small. Model C: the Tree of Life exists in the four w orlds of the creation, namely Atziluth, Briah, Yetzira h, and Assiah. When talking of \"the Tree\", we are talki ng about \"the Tree of Yetzirah\"; \"The Abyss\" is in fact \"the Abyss of Yetzirah\" only. All three models can be found in Kabbalistic writin g, and it is rarely clear which version an author is using at an y given time. I admit the fault myself. Model A differs radically from Models B and C: Model A is an all-embracing model of everyt hing, whereas in Models B and C the Tree has been applied r ecursively to a component of the whole, namely a human being considered a divine spark. This is a valid (if confusing ) Kabbalistic technique: take a whole, and find a new Tree in each of its components; apply the method recursively until you generate enough detail to explain anything. This idea is su mmed up in the aphorism: \"there is a Tree in every sephiroth\". Is it possible to experience the supernals in Model A? I would say that it is only possible to experience th em at a remove via the paths crossing over the Abyss from Tipher et; that is, as a living, incarnate being my consciousness rises no further up the Pillar of Consciousness than Tiphereth (or Daat h), but it is possible to apprehend the supernals via the linki ng paths. To experience the consciousness of Binah in this mo del would be"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"tantamount to being able to modify the physical constants of nature - Planck's constant, the speed of light, the Gravitational constant, the ratio of masses of particles etc. - the consequences don't bear thinking about! To exper ience Chokmah would be to experience the force which underpi ns a billion galaxies. I do not believe even the most arrog ant twentieth century magician would claim to have achieved eit her of these initiations - the continuing existence of the plane t is probably the best evidence for that. Model B is a model of the Microprosopus *a s a complete Tree*. There is some evidence in the \"Zohar\" tha t the author thought about the Macroprosopus and Microprosopus in precisely this way, with references to \"the greater Chokm ah\" and \"the lesser Chokmah\". Model C is substantially similar t o Model B, but cast in a slightly different model. With this inte rpretation it is certainly possible to consider \"the lesser Ch okmah\" as an accessible state of consciousness, but \"the Gre ater Chokmah\" remains as in Model A; that is, we can experience t he God within, \"God-in-the-Small\", and experience our essential u nity with all other living beings considered as \"Gods-in-the-Smal l\", but beyond that lies a greater mystery, that of \"God-in-the-L arge\". We may each be a chip off the old block, but individuall y we are not *identical* with the old block. This discussion may seem arcane, but there is a natural tendency in people to exalt spiritual experience t o the highest level, which does nothing more than inflate and devalue the currency of the language we use to describe these experiences. The universe is too large, too mysterious, and too full of infinite possibilities of wonder for anyone to cla im initiation into Malkuth, far less Kether. Lastly, it is worth asking \"what *is* God?\". What does the Kabbalistic trinity of Kether, Chokmah and Binah represent *in reality*? I have deliberately avoided mentioning an enormous amount of Kabbalistic material on these three seph iroth because it is not clear whether it contributes to a genuine understanding. How useful, for example, is it to know that the name Binah (BINH) contains not only IH (Yod, He), the letters representing Chokmah and Binah, but also BN, Ben, the son? There is a level of understanding Kabbalah which is inte llectual, and capable of almost inifinite elaboration, but it l eads nowhere. What experience or perception does the word \"God \" denote? If there is nothing which is not God, why are so many people searching for God? Why do so many people feel apart from God? I quoted D.H. Lawrence's poem \"Only Man\" because o f his deeply intuitive view of the Fall from God and the abyss o f separation. I was browsing in my local occult bookshop rece ntly, a shop which contains a catholic selection of books cov ering Eastern religions, astrology, Tarot, shamanism, crystal s, theosophy, magick, Celtic and Grail traditions, mytholo gy, Kabbalah, witchcraft, and so on. I am not sure what I was lo oking for, but despite a couple of hours of browsing I certainly did not find it. What did strike me was the extent to which so many of these books were written to make human beings *feel good* about themselves. There is a smug view permeating so much occult literature that \"spiritual\" human beings are a lit tle bit more \"advanced\" or \"developed\" than the pack, that the y are \"moving"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"along the Path\" towards some kind of \"enlightenm ent\", \"cosmic consciousness\", \"union with God\", \"divine love\", or one of many more fantastic and utterly sublime goals. It is all so empowering and affirming and cosy. Even in the less starry-e yed and gushy works the view is predominantly, almost exclu sively human- centred, and I found it difficult to avoid the im pression that the universe was designed as a foam-padded playgro und for human souls to romp around in. There is more than a lit tle truth in Marx's statement that religion is the opium of the people, and a cynic could justify a claim that occultism and esot eric religion are little more than a security blanket for unfor tunate people who cannot look reality in the face. Where are th e books which say \"you are an insignificant speck of flyshit in a universe so vast you cannot even begin to comprehend its scale; your occult pretensions amount to nothing and are carefully designed to protect you from any experience of reality; all hu man experience and knowledge is parochial, insignificant and larg ely irrelevant on a universal scale, and your personal contribut ion even more so; there are no Masters or Powers, no Secret Chi efs, no Inner Plane Adepti, no Messiahs, and God does not love you; the only thing you possess is your life, and the joy and mys tery of living in a universe filled to the brim with life, where l ittle is known and much remains to be discovered; when you die, yo u are dead.\" I do not concur with this position in its entirity, but it is a valid position to adopt, and one which is not strongly represented in esoteric and occult literature. Why not? Perhaps people do not want to buy books which say this. I w ill venture an opinion which reflects my own experience; as suc h it has no general validity, but it is worth recording neverth eless. I believe that many religious, esoteric and occult traditions currently extant are unconsciously desig ned to protect human beings from experiencing God and lead toward s experiences which are valid in themselves but which are b iased towards feelings of love, protection, peace, safety, pe rsonal growth, community and empowerment, all wrapped up in a st rongly human- centred value system where positive *human* feelings and experiences are emphasised. I believe that people are apart from God by choice, that they cannot find God because *they do not want to*. It is difficult to justify this statement with out resorting to an onion-skin model of the psyche; underneath the surface, unsuspected and virtually inaccessible, is a layer which does its best to protect us from the existential terror o f confronting things as they really are. As a child I was terr ified of the dark; the dark itself was not malign, but I was d eeply afraid, and in this case it was fear which determined my relationship with the dark, not any quality of the dark itself. So it is with God - it is our deeply buried and unrecognise d fear which determines our relationship with God. We read book s, go to the cinema and theatre, argue, invent, throw parties , play games, search for God, live and love together, and bury ou rselves in all the distractions of human society in a frenetic and unceasing effort to avoid the layers of fear - fear of solit ude, fear of rejection, fear of disease and decay and disintregr ation, fear of madness, fear of meaninglessness, arbitrariness and futility, fear of death and personal annihilation.

L ewis From an historical and traditional perspective the practical techniques of Kabbalah include techniques of mystic ism and (to a lesser extent) magic to be found the world over: complex"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"concentration and visualisation exercises, medit ation, breath control, prayer, ritual, physical posture, chantin g and singing, abstinence, fasting, mortification and good works. Many different combinations of practice were used at different tim es and places, and it is clear that practice grew more out of the temperament of the individual than from a long historical traditio n. From time to time an outstanding teacher would appear, and a school would form, but these schools tended to be short-lived, and one is struck more by the diversity and individuality of the different approaches, than by (what is often presumed) a cha in of masters handing down the core of a secret tradition through the centuries. A problem with trying to find an authen tic tradition of Kabbalistic practice is not only is it difficul t to identify just what such a tradition might be (given the diversity of approaches over the centuries), but more importantl y, the keys to many of the practical techniques have been lost. I n her book on Kabbalah [1], Perle Epstein makes a number of wry comments about the state of Kabbalah in Judaism today, and regrets the loss of a practical mystical tradition. Outside of Judaism th e situation is little better; Kabbalah has become an element in t he syllabus of many traditions, but its practical application is often limited to exercises such as pathworking. It is instructi ve to examine the Golden Dawn initiation rituals [2] as an exa mple of what happens when Kabbalah is boiled up with a mixture o f ingredients drawn from Greek, Egyptian, Rosicrucian and Enoch ian sources - there is a pervasive smell of Kabbalah throughout, but it rarely amounts to a meal. The following description of Kabbalistic prac tice makes no attempt to be comprehensive; on the contrary, I ha ve chosen only those practices with which I am personally familia r. This will be unsatisfactory to those readers with an academic or historical interest, but these notes were intended to have a practical value, and I see no value in trying to describe tec hniques I have not used. Epstein [1] provides a useful introdu ction to the breadth of Kabbalistic practice, and the personalit ies which have shaped Kabbalistic thought. I am aware that there will be those who would not wish to associate the name \"Kabbal ah\" with the practices I am about to describe - although I am n ot Jewish, I respect the beliefs of those who are - but at the s ame time there is a great deal of variety in nearly two thous and years of Kabbalah, and one living tradition is worth at lea st as much as several dead traditions. There is no right or canon ical tradition of Kabbalistic practice. The practice of Kabbalah as I will des cribe it is underpinned by the theosophical structure I h ave outlined previously in these notes. First and foremost com es the belief that there is a God. The ultimate nature of God is neither known nor manifest to us, but just as light can be pass ed through a prism to produce a rainbow of colours, so God man ifests in the creation as ten divine lights or emanations, usual ly referred to as sephiroth. Each of one of us is a part of God, a microcosm, a complete and functioning simulacrum of the whole, and so God similarly manifests within us as ten divine lights . Because we can look in the mirror of our own being and see the reflection of the macrocosm it follows that self-knowledge shades imperceptibly into knowledge of God, and as the whole of cr eation is an emanation of God, so self-knowledge moves th e centre of"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"consciousness away from a subjective awareness of r eality towards an objective and non-dualistic union with everythin g that is. The second key idea is that the emanations or sephiroth are aspects of the *creative* power of God. On a macro cosmic scale, the creation is seen as the continuing outcome of a dynamic process in which creative energy manifests progress ively through the sephiroth; at a microcosmic and personal le vel the same process is at work, and this is the Kabbalistic int erpretation of the notion that we are \"made in God's image\". By understanding the elements which comprise our own natures, by go ing far enough inside ourselves to understand the energy and dynam ics operating within our own consciousness, so we touch the same energies operating in the universe. When we have touched the se energies we can call on them; one name for this process is \"magic\". Traditionally these energies are called upon by n ame, and are characterised in concrete ways - the list of c orrespondences given in Chapter 2 of these notes provides many id eas as to how these energies are likely to be observed at a level where we are most likely to observe them. The Kabbalistic Tree of Life is an abstract representation or map describing the creat ive energy of God and the process of manifestation. And that is it, in essence. How literally y ou take these assumptions is up to you; my attitude resembles that of the engineer Oliver Heavyside, who didn't care wheth er his self- invented mathematical methods made sense to mathema ticians (they didn't), as long as his calculations produced the right answers (they did). I will talk about angels and archangel s and names of God, powers and sephiroth and invocations, and leav e it to you to make your own sense of it. But to return to the discussion of practical Kabbalah: one can identify two major kinds of practical work aris ing out of the assumptions above. From the idea that we are made i n the image of God we can conclude that by knowing ourselves we can (in some degree) know God; this leads to practical work designed to increase self-knowledge to the greatest degree possible, a process I will refer to as *initiation*. From the idea that we can call upon aspects of the creative energy of G od to change reality we arrive at practices intended to incre ase *personal power*. Kabbalah has divided along these two paths, and I believe it is accurate to say that traditional Jewish Kabbalah is predominantly mystical, with the emphasis on uni on with God, while non-Jewish Kabbalah is predominantly magi cal. It is easy to sit in judgement of these two ap proaches; many authors have done so. To seek for union with God is to seek to do God's will; the world-wide mystical agenda is compo sed largely of the subjugation of ego and the replacement of perso nal wilfulness with divine union. Magic is seen to be predominant ly wilful, and so shares the original Satanic impulse of pride and rebellion against the divine will. It is easy to conclude that mystical union (devekuth, or \"cleaving to God\") is the tr ue goal, and magic an \"egocentric\" aberration of consciousness. It is difficult to provide a *rational* cou nter to this argument: to be rational is to fail to ap preciate the ineffability of mystical insight, and to argue is to demonstrate Satanic wilfulness - one is condemned out of one' s own mouth. Nevertheless, there is a middle way between the two extremes, and in what follows the process of initiation is combi ned with the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"use of magical techniques in a blend which I believ e captures the best of both approaches. I have chosen to describe the process of initiation first because I have the romantic no tion that an ethical sense grows out of self-knowledge. I follo w that with a discussion of some general magical techniques. Initiation ---------- One of the meanings of the word \"initiation\" is \"t he process of beginning something\". What is one beginning? One is committing oneself to find answers to certain questions. What questions? The questions vary, but they are usually fundamental q uestions about the nature of life and personal existence: \"why is the world the way it is?\", \"why am I alive?\", \"what lies behind the phenomenal world?\", \"why should I continue living?\", \"what is good and what is evil?\", \"how should I live?\", and \"how can I become rich, famous and sexually attractive without expending an y effort?\". It happens (for no obvious reason) that there are peo ple who cannot escape the nagging conviction that some or all of t hese questions can be answered, and the same people are determine d to wring the answers out of somebody or something. The situatio n resembles a cat in a new house; the poor creature will not res t until it has explored every nook and cranny from the attic to th e crawlspace. So it is with certain people; they look out on th e world with cat's eyes, and metaphysical and philosophical ques tions are like dark openings into the attic and crawlspace of exis tence. And it happens that every question, when followed with enough determination, leads back to the questioner. Wha t is the pre- condition for knowing anything? We are the attics a nd crawlspaces of existence, and so in the end we forced to look within, and know ourselves. There is another aspect to initiation: on one hand we have the desire to *know*, and on the other hand we have the desire to *be something else*. Initiation is also the be ginning of a process of self-transformation, a process of becom ing something else. Becoming what? Answers vary, but in the main, people have a vision of \"myself made perfect\", and if they belie ve in saints, they want to be saintly; if they believe in God, t hey want to be united with God. Some want to be more powerful, an d some want to be rich, famous, and sexually attractive. Two eas ily observable characteristics of people looking for mystical or magical training are a lust for knowledge and a desire to be something other than what they currently are. A bizarre situ ation indeed; not only do they seek to know what they are and why they are, but even before they know the answers, they want to be something else. Kabbalistic initiation is a process of inc reasing self- knowledge, and an accompanying process of change. It is based on a practical experience of the sephiroth: if ea ch of us is potentially a simulacrum of God, and if the creat ive energy of God can be described in terms of the dynamics of the ten sephiroth, then by understanding the dynamics of the sephiroth within us we begin to understand the nature of the God within, and by extrapolation, the nature of God in the absolute. The learning process (like most learning) mirrors t he alchemical operation of \"solve et coagula\" - that is, before we can reach"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"the next stage in knowledge and understanding (\"co agula\") it is necessary to break down what already exists into its component parts (\"solve\"). This can be observed whenever w e attempt to learn a new skill; we begin in a state of unconcio us competence where we can do many tasks without difficulty, but when we try a new skill we find that our old habits are a posit ive obstacle, and we become unconsciously incompetent - we approa ch a new task in an old way and make a mess of it. When we have made enough messes we either give up, or we realise the necess ity of change, drop old habits as a prerequisite for acquirin g new habits (solve), and become consciously incompetent. Finall y, with enough practice (coagula), we return once more to a state of unconscious competence, ready to begin the cycle one more time . The process of kabbalistic initiation leading to increased self-knowledge begins with the sephiroth, and each sephira contai ns within it a world of \"solve et coagula\", a world where one may function with limited unconscious competence, but to reach a new level of understanding and competence one must go through the fire and experience the energy of the sephira deli berately and consciously. What possible advantage could there be in unde rstanding the nature of a sephira? What \"things\" are there to be learned? In answer, there are no \"things\" to be learned. A se phira is not a particular manifestation of consciousness (e.g. pl easure), or a particular behaviour (e.g. being honest, bein g kind); the sephiroth underpin manifestations of consciousness, they are the earth in which behaviours (and their opposites) are rooted, and by understanding a sephira one burrows underneath t he *phenomena* of consciousness and grasps an abstract state of *becoming* (emanation, or sephira) which gives rise to phenom ena. This is a magical procedure; when one ceases to identify wit h the shopping list of qualities, beliefs and behaviours which ca n be mistaken for personal identity (a necessarily fixed and limited abstraction) then one touches the raw substance of becoming, and it is on the power to manipulate the \"becoming\" of reality that magic is based. The closer one tries to get to th e energy of a sephira, the more one must abandon the artificial r estrictions of personality; the mystical quest for self-knowl edge and the magical quest for personal power unite in the same place. There are many ways to investigate the n ature of the sephiroth, but one of the simplest and most direct is to ask the powers of the sephiroth for help. In principal all one has to do is call upon the powers of a sephira, and ask to b e instructed. There are three potential problems with this proced ure. The first is that it is like asking to be dropped in a wilder ness; you may learn to survive, or you may not. The second possi ble problem is that people tend to have a natural affinity for s ome sephiroth and not others, and left to themselves tend to develop their knowledge in a lop-sided manner. Lastly, many peop le do not know how to call upon the powers - you can't ask Gabrie l to help you if you don't know Gabriel, and you don't know ho w to contact Gabriel. But, if you knew someone who knew Gabriel. ... The time-honoured method of initiation into th e nature of a particular sephira is to ask someone who has had th at experience to invoke to powers of the sephira on your behalf . The person chosen as initiator would use the techniques of ri tual magic to invoke the powers of a sephira with the intention t hat you should"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"receive instruction and insight into the nature of that sphere. It works. Metaphysical theories may be impossible to prove or disprove, supposed magical powers evaporate in the physics laboratory, but people who undergo this kind of i nitiation can change visibly and even claim to have learned somet hing. One can argue about the objective reality of the Archangel Gabriel and the Powers of the sephira Yesod, but it is difficu lt to dispute the validity of initiation when someone changes his or her outlook on reality and actually does things diff erently as a consequence. I would like to clarify some possible misu nderstandings. This kind of initiation is not a ceremony with a fixed and lengthy script, like the masonic-type rituals whic h have become so closely associated with magical initiations. T he initiation ritual I am describing is a challenge; it is a one-to-one encounter between an initiatee, and an initiator who acts as agent for the invoked powers. If there is a script it is minimal; the purpose of the ritual is not to impart secrets, or impose a view of the world, but to challenge the initiatee to demonstrate a personal and individual understanding relev ant to the initiation. The success of the initiation de pends on the initiator's ability to invoke and channel the power s, and on the initiatee's willingness to be challenged at a de eply personal level in an atmosphere of trust. The challen ge aspect of initiation is a vital part of its success; it creat es a catalytic stress which can act to bring about sudden and some times dramatic changes in perspective. The initiation is also a challenge for the initiator; each initiatee is different and a pproaches the same place from a different direction. This kind of initiation is not a lightweight procedure. It is easy to abuse it. The purpose of initiation is not to select for conformity (quite the opposite), but it must b e said that it is easy for an initiator to use an initiation to en hance personal power. This is a problem in esoteric systems which use an apprenticeship system and is not unique to this pa rticular form of initiation. Self-initiation is possible and may be the on ly option for many people. It suffers from a number of di sadvantages: - people are naturally self-important and endow their opinions, attitudes and prejudices with far more importance than another person would. Workin g with another person produces beneficial friction. - it is easy to make excuses to yourself which you wouldn't make to another person. Their presence is a challenge to make an effort, or do things differently. - magical work can produce dramatic changes in behaviour. An observer can provide useful feedback. - most of Kabbalah isn't \"facts\"; it is \"ways of being\", and an excellent method of learning is to let someone else demonstrate. - it is easy to reinvent the wheel when workin g by oneself. "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"None of these difficulties are insurmountable. Joining an amateur dramatic group as a conscious and delib erate magical exercise should provide some of the raw input neede d, and provide lots of stress, friction, and challenges to one's personal world view. It is easy to think up other examples. What i s important is not to treat practical Kabbalah as something separa te from normal life, but to use normal life as the stimulus to put Kabbalah into practice - this is a traditional Kabbalistic idea. If you can't do it in ordinary life, you can't do it. It is easy to mystify initiation and pret end it leads somewhere different from the \"school of hard knocks \". It doesn't. Ordinary life is a perfectly adequate initiator, and people do change in many ways (sometime dramatically) as the y grow older. At most initiation may go further. It can and shou ld accelerate the process of acquiring self-knowledge and (in the ory at least) lead to someone who has explored their personal mi crocosm in a broader, deeper and more systematic way than someo ne who has had to suffer \"the slings and arrows of outrageous for tune\" in the patchy and random sequence that is our common lot. The Kabbalist should be able to go further in exploring and analysing the extremes of consciousness, boundless steppes in the shadowland of \"not-me\", where daemons of \"otherness\" threaten the fragile ghost of personal identity. Much of what an initiator does is to ask quest ions. If you want to carry out a self-initiation you will have t o ask your own questions. I will use the sephiroth of Hod an d Netzach as examples to show how the sephirothic correspondence s can be used to ask questions. Suppose you want to identify tho se behaviours and attitudes in your personality which are underp inned by Hod and Netzach. Read the correspondences in Chapter 2 for Hod and Netzach and try to decide. Are you impulsive? Do y ou do what you want to do and ignore people who warn you of the co nsequences? Do you have strong passions for things, people, places . If asked why you are doing something, how do you explain yours elf - do you give elaborate rationalisations, or do you say th ings like \"I haven't any choice\", or \"you made me do it\", or \"I just want to\", or \"I can't explain why\". Do other people tell you to stop being irrational? Do you find it hard to suppress your em otions, do you think you are transparent to others? Are you furio us one minute, miserably sad the next, do your moods and fe elings change on the fly? On the other hand, you might be someone who is concerned with the protocol of relationships and situation s (you worry whether it is right to kiss on the first date!). Yo u like to talk about things and have definite ideas about the rig ht and wrong way to conduct a discussion - you refer to th is as \"being rational\". You analyse your conduct in some detail according to a constantly developing set of rules, and you dream u p hypothetical situations to test your ability to apply these rule s - you don't want to make a mistake. You are skilled at handling problems with many rules, and may be adept at cheating the rules . You have a clear grasp of high-level abstractions and might work in law, medicine, finance, science, or engineering, whe re you can use your ability to apply rule-based knowledge. Yo u might feel uncomfortable with a display of emotion in an other person, particlarly when it cuts across your sense of proto col, and you keep a tight rein on your own emotions. Other peopl e may find you"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"sharp but clinical, able to communicate verbally but poor at responding to real-life situations involving emotio nal conflict, poor at any problem where there is insufficient information, where variables cannot be quantified, or where there is no abstract model. The first set of behaviours is appropriate to Netzach, while the second set is appropriate to Hod. Few people a re purely one thing or another, and behaviours change according t o circumstance - drinking alcohol tends to shift people from Hod-t ype behaviours to Netzach-type behaviours. A person may sustain a Hod persona at work, then go to a bar in the evening and become the complete opposite. My favourite Hod/Netzach joke concern s the (real) couple who were asked which of the two sephiroth they had the greatest affinity to. The man responded \"Well, I feel I'm Hod\", and the woman replied \"I think I'm probably Netzac h\". The analysis can be taken further. Supp ose you have identified a large number of Hod-type behaviours in yourself. The virtue of Hod is honesty or truthfulness, and its vice is dishonesty - the power of language to represent an d communicate information about the world automatically brings with it the power to *misrepresent* what is going on. How o ften are you dishonest? With yourself? With others? In what sit uations do you sanction dishonesty? What value do you perceive i n dishonesty? Are you capable of giving a purely factual account of a failed, close relationship without rationalising your own b ehaviour? Try it, and ask a good friend to score the attempt. I must emphasise that there is no moral intent in this dissection of personal honesty - it is an exercise designed to expose the way in which we represent events so as to make ourselves feel co mfortable. The illusion of Hod is Order, and the qlippa o r shell of Hod is Rigid Order. It is easy to observe during di scussions and arguments how people try to defend and preserve the structure (or form) of their beliefs. Do you know anyone with a n unshakeable view of the world? Does it annoy you that no matter how ingenious you are in finding counter-examples to his or he r view, this person will always succeed in \"fitting\" your examp le into their world view? What about yourself? Do you collect evidence which reinforces your beliefs like someone collecting sta mps? Are you conscious of trying to \"fit\" and \"interpret\" the evidence to support your beliefs? Why are your beliefs import ant? What is their actual *value* to you. What would happen to y ou if you gave them up? You can do the same thing with the sephira Netzach. The illusion of Netzach is projection, the averse fac e of empathy, the tendency to incorrectly attribute to others the same feelings and motives as I have. Suppose I am sexually attracted to someone; I look at this person and they smile in return. What does that smile mean to me at that instant? How m any different mistakes might I have made? Suppose I say to someo ne \"I know how you feel\", and they retort angrily \"No you bloody well don't!\". One of the fastest ways of alienating someone is to consistently misinterpret how they feel. Are you constantly puzz led why people don't share your taste in clothes, music, literatur e, films, art, or decor? Do you feel that if only their eyes were opened, they might? Do you ever try to convert people to your t aste? How do react when they aren't impressed? Do you make secr et judgements which affect the way you treat them? Have you ev er discounted"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"someone because their taste offended yours? What *value* does your personal aesthetic have to you? What would h appen if you gave it up? As you can see, this is not a procedure where anyone (barring yourself) is going to provide answers. Qu estions, yes; lots of questions, but no answers. Asking the ri ght questions isn't easy; we tend to have a peculiar blindness about our own behaviour, beliefs, and attitudes, and that tran slates into an unconsciousness of what we are. One of the oldes t jokes that children play is to stick a notice on someone's bac k saying \"Kick Me\". The poor unfortunate walks around and won ders why his acquaintances are behaving oddly - tittering, sneak ing up behind, and so on. He can't see what other people can see c learly, and he hasn't the power to understand (and possibly inf luence) their behaviour until he does see. Suppose an \"initiator \" walks up and says: \"Have you looked at your back recently?\" \"Ahhhh....!\" says the victim in a sudden flash of insight. According to folk wisdom, asking questions i s a dangerous business. Asking yourself questions certainly is. It hurts. It has no obvious benefit. You may find yourself hati ng yourself as you penetrate layers of self-deception and dishon esty only to discover a fear (or terror) of changing, and piou s resolutions and commitments fall apart in the face of that fear . You take off the first skin, and then you take off the next skin , and then you take off the skin under that. Then you get stuck. You can't go any further by yourself - you haven't the courage t o do it - and at the same time you can't go back to what you were . A blind and deaf man can stand happily in the middle of a busy road, but give him sight and hearing for only a second and that happiness is gone. It is at this point where it helps to have a faith in a power greater than yourself - your Holy Guardian An gel, God, the Lion, whatever. In summary, the process of kabbalistic initia tion described above is based in detail on the map of consciousnes s provided by the Tree of Life and the correspondences. The sephiroth are explored by using ritual magic to invoke the p owers of the sephiroth for the purposes of initiation. Incidents in ordinary life are interpreted as challenges or learning experiences supplied by the powers. Major steps in the process of initiation are marked by observable changes in the initiatee, and confirmed by an initiator whose role is primaril y that of a catalyst. This technique of initiation has been use d for at least one hundred years, but its execution has tended to be marred by a good deal of superfluous dross - elaborate ce remonials and scripts, pompous and often meaningless grades and titles, and magical systems so vastly elaborate that the woul d-be initiate spends more time looking at the finger than the moo n. Ritual ====== The Kabbalistic ritual technique I am about to desc ribe is based on an assumption which may or may not be valid, bu t which gives the technique a characteristic style. The assumpt ion is \"form"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"precedes manifestation\"; that is, anything which manifests in this, the real, physical world, is preceded by a process of \"formation\", a process described in its general o utline by the doctrine of sephirothic emanation and the Kabbali stic Tree of Life. This premise is not so odd or metaphysical as it might seem. Every object in the room I am sitting in is a product of human manufacture. The mug I am drinking my tea ou t of was once clay, and its form existed in someone's mind befor e taking shape in fired clay. The house I live in was once a n architect's design, and before that, an abstract object in a la nd developer's scheme for making lots of money. Every obje ct of human manufacture originally existed as an idea or form in someone's mind, and each idea went through a process of deve lopment, from inspiration to manufacture - I have described much of this elsewhere in these Notes. It is not a large step t o conceive of the whole universe as the product of mind, so that every form of substance - the physical elements, each species of plant and animal - are the result of a process of formation occuring in mind. Where are these abstract minds? They compose a whole which the Kabbalist conveniently labels \"God\", and the parts, if we want to refer to them seperately as subordinate c omponents, we call \"archangels\", and \"angels\" and \"spirits\", an d \"elementals\" and \"devils\". Each of these minds or intellige nces holds a portion of the archetypal form of the world in pla ce, and each mind is a form in its own right; each of the se archetypal intelligences can be comprehended as a part o f Binah, the Intelligence of God and Mother of all form. When I drop a stone, it falls to the ground. It does this because the spirit of matter inhabiting the stone u ses messenger spirits (or angels) called gravitons to communic ate with the spirit of matter inhabiting the Earth. It turns out that the curvature of space-time (its form) is determined b y the Lords of Matter in an intricate but completely exact way acc ording to the distribution of mass-energy - the details can be su mmarised in an equation first written down by Albert Einstein. It may seem absurd and retrograde (and William of Occam would c ertainly turn in his grave) to suggest that what we call the law s of physics are forms maintained in the minds of archetypal intelligences, but as Einstein himself stated, \"The most incompre hensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible\"; that is, it can be described using language. There *are* abstract forms which describe change in the physical world, and t hey *can* be comprehended by mind, and although it is a large s tep to propose that mind takes primacy over matter, it is a view attractive to the practising magician. It is a view completely c onsistent with Kabbalah. When I call upon a spirit to modify the law of gravity at a specific time and place, I am not violating a physical law; I am *changing* it at its source. If \"form precedes manifestation\", then pract ical magic is about understanding how the future is formed out of the present. The seeds of many futures are planted in the present, and accessible to the magician as the forms of the futu re. The forms of the future are being progressed by many minds ; where they overlap, there is conflict and inconsistency, a situation resembling a bus where each passenger has a s teering wheel providing an unknown and variable input to the even tual direction of the bus. In one interpretation (primacy of will) the magician"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"is the person with the most powerful steering wheel ; in another interpretation (Taoist nudging) the magician is a person who understands the dynamics of steering sufficiently well to use opportune moments to move the bus in a desired dire ction. Perhaps both interpretations are valid. In either case, i f one accepts the simile, then it should be clear that magic is rarely about certain outcomes. In both cases the magician must have a clear notion of direction, what is usually called *intent ion*. Formation is a process of increasing l imitation or constraint. Once something is manifest it is c onstrained or limited by what it is at that instant. Suppose I w ant to make a film. It could be a film about *anything*. Once I h ave a script I am more limited, but have a lot of scope in direct ing the film - choice of actors, sets, locations etc. Once I have the rushes my choices are even more constrained, but I still hav e some freedom in the editing. Finally, once the film is release d, I have no more freedom to change it, unless, like some direc tors, I choose to re-edit and re-issue it. Intention is also a lim itation: it is a limitation of will. I chose to make a film, but I could have chosen to write a book instead, or chosen to take a holiday. In choosing to make a film I limited my free-will. I c ould of course abandon the film project, but a life of incomple te, abandoned projects is not very satisfactory to most people, so my will to complete (i.e. to bring into manifestation) sustain s my intention and I have to learn to live with this fairly considerable limitation on my theoretical free-will. The limitation of will and the formation of the film go hand-in-hand. I can't just intend to make a film : I have to intend to get a script, find some money, borrow t he equipment, recruit some actors and a crew. The formation of the film is driven by a fragmentation of my original intenti on into many components and sub-components as the task proceeds, and activity and intention feed off each other until, knee-deep in the details of film making, I might find myself thinking \"I'd give anything if we could get this scene in the can and knock off for a beer.\" We have gone from a person with theoretically unlim ited free-will to someone who cannot knock off for a beer. Most pe ople who go to work and attempt to bring up a family are in this situation of being so limited by previous choices and past hist ory that they have very little actual free-will or uncommitt ed energy, a situation which has to be understood in some detail before attempting serious magical work. To summarise: if magic is about making things *happen*, then the magician might want to understand the process of formation which precedes manifestation, and understand not o nly the forms which other people are *intending*, forms w hich may be competitive, but also the detailed relationship bet ween formation and intention. You don't have to understand these things; many people like magic to be truely *magical* (i.e. wit hout causality or mechanism), but Kabbalah does provide a theoret ical model for magical work (the lightning flash on the Tree) whi ch many have found to be useful. I think it is a mistake to con fuse a lack of consciousness of mechanism with a lack of mechan ism, just as someone might look at a clock and assume that it g oes round \"by magic\", and so I'd like to say something more abou t the concept of limitation, a concept essential to understandi ng the ritual framework I am going to describe."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" We are limited beings: our lives are limited t o some tens of years, our bodies are limited in their physical a bilities, and compared to the different kinds of life on this p lanet we are clearly very specialised compared with the poten tial of what we could be if we had the free choice of being anything we wanted. Even as human beings we are limited, in t hat we are all quite distinct from each other; we limit ourselve s to a small number of behaviours, attitudes and beliefs an d guard that individuality and uniqueness as an inalienable rig ht. We limit ourselves to a few skills because of the effor t and talent required, and only in exceptional cases do we find people who are expert in a large number of different skills - mos t people are happy if they are acknowledged as being an expert in one thing. It is a fact that as the sum total of knowledge increases, so people (particularly those with technical skills) are forced to become more and more specialised. This idea of limitation and specialisation has found its way into magical ritual because of a magical (or mystic al) perception that, although all consciousness in the universe is One, and that Oneness can be perceived directly, it has become l imited. There is a process of limitation (formation) in wh ich the One (God, if you like) becomes progressively str uctured and constrained until it reaches the level of thee and me. Magicians and mystics the world over are relatively unanimous in insisting that the normal everyday consciousness of most hum an beings is a severe limitation on the potential of conscious ness, and it is possible, through various disciplines, to extend consciousness into new regions. From a magical poi nt of view the personality, the ego, the continuing sense of in dividual \"me- ness\", is a magical creation, an artifici al elemental or thoughtform which consumes our magical power in exchange for the kind of limitation necessary to survive, a nd in order to work magic it is necessary to divert energy aw ay from this obsession with personal identity and self-importanc e. Now, consider the following problem: you have been imprisoned inside a large inflated plastic bag. Y ou have been given a sledghammer and a scalpel. Which tool wil l get you out faster? The answer I am obviously looking for is th e scalpel. The key to getting out of large, inflated, plastic ba gs is to apply as much force as possible to as sharp a point as possible. Magicians agree on this principle - the key to succ essful ritual is a \"single-pointed will\". A mystic may tr y to expand consciousness in all directions simultaneously, to encompass more and more of the One, to embrace the One, per haps even to transcend the One, but this is hard, and most peopl e aren't up to it in practise. Rather than expand in al l directions simultaneously, it is much easier to limit an excursion of consciousness in one direction only, and the more precise and well-defined that limitation to a specific directio n, the easier it is to get out of the plastic bag. Limitation of consciousness is the trick we use to cope with the complexities of life in modern society, and as long as we are forced to li ve under this yoke we might as well make a virtue out of a neces sity, and use our carefully cultivated ability to concentrate attention on minutiae to burst out of the bag. We find the concept of limitation appearing i n the process of formation which leads to manifestation; in the limitation of"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"will which leads to intention; now I suggest tha t a focussed limitation of consciousness is one method to re lease magical energy. Limitation is the key to understanding the structure of magical ritual as described in these notes, and the key to successful practice. Essential Steps --------------- I decided against giving the details of any ri tuals. All the rituals I have taken a part in were written by one or more of the people present. I do not think any of the rituals would be worth preserving for their literary or poetic content. On the other hand, the majority of the rituals I have taken a part in have conformed to a basic structure which has rarely varied; this structure we called \"the essential steps\". There is never going to be agreement about wha t is essential in a ritual and what is not, any more than there will ever be agreement about what makes a good novel. That does n't mean there is nothing worth learning. The steps I enumera te below are suggestions which were handed down to me, and a l ot of insight (not mine) has gone into them; they conform to a W estern magical tradition which has not changed in its essentials for thousands of years, and I hand them on to you in the same spirit as I received them. These are the essential steps: 1. Open the Circle 2. Open the Gates 3. Invocation to the Powers 4. Statement of Intention and Sacrifice 5. Main Ritual 6. Dismissal of Powers 7. Close the Gates 8. Close the Circle Step 1: Opening the Circle The Circle is the place where magical work is carried out. It might literally be circle on the ground, or i t could be a church, or a stone ring, or a temple, or it might be an imagined circle inscribed in the aethyr, or it could be any spot hallowed by tradition. In some cases the Circle is created specifically for one piece of work and then closed, while in oth er cases (e.g. a church) the building is consecrated and all the space within the building is treated as if it was an open cir cle for long periods of time. I don't want to deal too much in generalities, so I will deal with the common case where a circl e is created specifically for one piece of work, for a pe riod of time typically less than one day. The place where t he circle is created could be anywhere: indoors, outdoors, to p of a hill, a cellar. It could be an imaginary place, the ritual carried out in a lucid dream for example. Most often a ritual will take place in a room in a house, and the first magical ability the magician develops is the ability to turn any place into a te mple. I like to prepare a room with some kind of cleaning, and clear enough"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"floor space for a real or visualised circle. I se cure the room against access as far as possible, take the phone off the hook etc. The Circle is the first important magical limi t: it creates a small area within which the magical work take s place. The magician tries to control everything which takes pl ace within the Circle (limitation), and so a circle half-a-mi le across is impractical. The Circle marks the boundary betwee n the rest of the world (going on its way as normal), and a magic al space where things are most definitely not going on as norm al (otherwise there wouldn't be any point in carrying out a ritua l in the first place). There is a dislocation: the region inside the circle is separated from the rest of space and is free to go its own way. There are some types of magical work where it may n ot be sensible to have a circle (e.g. working with the natural el ements in the world at large) but unless you are working with a power already present in the environment in its normal state, i t is best to work within a circle. The Circle may be a mark on the ground, or s omething more intangible still; my own preference is an imagined line of blue fire drawn in the air. It is in the nature of cons ciousness that anything taken as real and treated as real will eventually be accepted as Real - and if you want to start an a rgument, state that money doesn't exist and isn't Real. From a ritual point of view the Circle is a real boundary, and if its usefulness is to be maintained it should be treated with the same respect as an electrified fence. Pets, childre n and casual onlookers should be kept out of it. Whatever pr ocedures take place within the Circle should only take place with in the Circle and in no other place, and conversely, your norma l life should not intrude on the Circle unless it is part of y our intention that it should. From a symbolic point of view, the Circle marks a new \"circle of normality\", a circle different fro m your usual \"circle of normality\", making it possible to keep the two \"regions of consciousness\" distinct and separate. The magician leaves everyday life behind when the Circle is opened, and returns to it when the Circle is closed, and for the duration adopts a discipline of thought and deed which is sp ecific to the type of magical work being undertaken; this proced ure is not so different from that in many kinds of laboratory whe re scientists work with hazardous materials. Opening a Circle usually involves drawing a circle in the air or on the ground, accompanied by an invocation to guardian spirits, or the elemental powers of the f our quarters, or the four watchtowers, or the archangels, or what ever. The well known Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram [2] can be use d as the basis for a Kabbalistic circle-opening. The precise met hod isn't so important as practicing it until you can do it in y our sleep, and it should be carried out with the same attitude as a soldier on formal guard duty outside a public building. The ki nd of ritual I am describing is formal; much of its effectiveness derives from a clinical precision. For example, I never at anytim e turn or move in an anti-clockwise direction within the circle. When I work in a group one of the most important officers i s the sword- bearing sentinel, responsible for procedure and dis cipline within the circle. When you create a circle you are e stablishing a perimeter under the watchful \"eyes\" of whatever guardians you"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"have requested to keep an eye on things, and a mar tial attitude and sense of discipline and precision creates the right psychological mood. When working in a group it is helpful if the person opening the circle announces \"the circle is now open\" because there should be no doubt among those present about whether the opening has been completed to the satisfaction of the person carrying it out, and the sacred sp ace has been established. Step 2: Opening the Gates The Gates in question are the boundary betwee n normal and magical consciousness. Just as opening the Circl e limits the ritual in space, so opening the Gates limits the r itual in time. Not everyone opens the Gates as a separate activit y; opening a Circle can be considered a de-facto opening of Gate s, but there are good reasons for keeping the two activit ies separate. Firstly, it is convenient to be able to open a C ircle without going into magical consciousness; despite what I s aid about not bringing normal consciousness into the Circle, rul es are made to be broken, and there are times when something u npleasant and unwanted intrudes on normal consciousness, and a Circle can be used to keep it out - think of pulling blankets ove r your head at night. Secondly, opening the Gates as a separate activity means they can be tailored to the specific type of magical consciousness you are trying to enter. Thirdly, just as bank vaults and ICBMs have two keys, so it is prudent to make the entry into magical consciousness something you are not likely to do on a whim, and the more distinct steps there a re, the more conscious effort is required. Lastly - and it is an important point - opening the Circle is best done with a mart ial attitude, and it is useful to have a breathing space to switc h out of that mood and into the mood needed for the invocation. Opening the Gates provides an opportunity to make that switch. There are many ways to open the Gates, and m any Gates you could open. I imagine the gates in front of me, an d I physically open them, reaching out with both arms. I visual ise different gates for different sephiroth, and sometimes diffe rent gates for the same sephira. Step 3: Invocation to the Powers The invocation to the Powers is normally an ex cuse for some of the most leaden, pompous, grandiose and turgid p rose ever written or recited. Tutorial books on magic ar e full of this stuff. If you are invoking Saturn during a waxing moon you might be justified in going on like Brezhnev addressing t he Praesidium of the Soviet Communist Party, but as in every ot her aspect of magic, the trick isn't what you do, but how you do it, and interminable invocations aren't the answer. On a pr actical level, reading a lengthy invocation from a sheet of paper in dim candlelight will require so much conscious effort t hat it is hard to \"let go\", so try to keep things simple and to t he point, so that you can do an invocation without having to th ink about it too much, and that will leave room for the m ore important \"consciousness changing\" aspect of the invocation. When I do sephirothic work I use the sephirothic God, Arc hangel, Angel"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Order and sephira names as part of my invocation, and put all my effort into the intonation of the name rather th an memorising lengthy invocations. An invocation is like a ticket for a train: if you can't find the train there isn't much point in having the ticket. Opening the Gates gets you to the doorstep of magical consciousness, but it is the invocation which gets you onto the train and propels you to the right place, an d that isn't something which \"just happens\" unless you have a na tural aptitude for the aspect of consciousness you are invoking. It does happen that way however; people tend to begin their magi cal work with those areas of consciousness where they feel most at home, so they may well have some initial success. Violent, evil people do violent and evil conjurations; loving people invok e love - most people begin their magical work with \"a free tic ket\", but in general invoking takes practice, and the power of the invocation comes from practice, not from deathless prose. I can't give a prescription for ente ring magical consciousness. Well devised rituals, practised oft en, have a way of shifting consciousness which is surprising and unexpected. I don't know why this happens; it just does. I suspec t the peculiar character of ritual, the way it involves every se nse, occupies mind and body at the same time, its numinou s and exotic symbolism, the intensity of preparation and execu tion, involve dormant parts of the mind, or at least engage the n ormal parts in an unusual way. Using ritual to cause marke d shifts in consciousness is not difficult; getting the results you want, and avoiding unexpected and undesired side-effects is harder. Ritual is not a rational procedure. The symbolism of magic is intuitive and bubbles out of a very deep well; the whole process of ritual effectively bypasses the rational mind, so expecting the outcome of a ritual to obey the dictates of reason is completely irrational. The image of a horse is appropriate: anyone can get on the back of a wild mustang, but getting to the point where horse and rider go in the same directio n at the same time takes practice. The process of limitation desc ribed in these notes can't influence the natural waywardness of th e animal, but at least it is a method of ensuring the horse gets a clear message. Step 4: Statement of Intention and Sacrifice If magical ritual is not to be regarded as a form of bizarre entertainment carried out for its own sake , then there has to be a reason for doing it - healing, divinat ion, personal development, initiation, and the like. If it is he aling, then it is usually healing for one specific person, and the n again, it is not just healing in general, but healing for some specific complaint, within some period of time. The statemen t of intention is the culmination of a process of limitation whic h begins when the Circle is opened, and to return to the analogy of the plastic bag, the statement of intention is like the blade on the scalpel - the more precise the intention, the more the e nergy of the ritual is applied to a single point. The observation that rituals work better if th eir energy is focussed by intention is in accord with our experience in everyday life: any change, no matter how small or insignificant,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"tends to meet with opposition. If you want to chang e the brand of coffee in the coffee machine, or if you want to rearrange the furniture in the office, someone will object. If you want to drive a new road through the countryside, local people will object. If you want to raise taxes, everyone obje cts. The more people you involve in a change, the more opposit ion you will encounter, and in magic the same principle holds, because from a magical point of view the whole fabric of the unive rse is held in place by an act of collective intention involving e verything from God downwards. When you perform a ritual you are se tting yourself up against that collective will to keep most things the way they are, and your ritual will succeed only if certai n things are true: 1. you are a being of awesome will (you have the biggest steering wheel on the bus). 2. you have allies (lots of people on the bus want to get to the same place as you). 3. you limit your intention to minimise oppos ition (Taoist nudging); another analogy is the diamond cutte r who exploits natural lines of cleavage to split a diamond. Regardless of which is the case, I will suggest t hat precision and clarity of intention will generally produce bet ter results. And so to sacrifice. The problem arises from the perception that in magic you don't get something for nothing , and if you want to bring about change through magic you have to pay for it in some way. So far so good. The question is: wha t can you give in return? You can't legitimately sacrif ice anything which is not yours to give, and so the answer to the question \"what can I sacrifice\" lies in the answer to the question \"what am I, and what have I got to give?\". If you do n't make the mistake of identifying yourself with your possessi ons you will see that the only sacrifice you can make is your self, because that is all you have to give. Every ritual inten tion requires that you sacrifice some part of yourself, and if y ou don't make the sacrifice willingly then either the ritual will fail, or the price will be exacted without your consent. You don't have to donate pints of blood or your kidneys. Each person has a certain amount of what I will call \"life energy\" at their disposal - Casteneda calls it \"personal power\" - and you can sacrifice some of that energy to power the ritual. What that means in ordinary down-to-earth terms is that you promise to do something in return for your inte ntion, and you link the sacrifice to the intention in such a way that the sacrifice focuses energy along the direction of y our intention. For example, my cat was ill and hadn't eaten for th ree weeks, so, as a last resort, fearing she would die of starvati on, I carried out a ritual to restore her appetite, and as a sa crifice I ate nothing for 24 hours. I used my (very real) hunge r to drive the intention, and she began eating the following day. Any sacrifice which hurts enough engages a ver y deep impulse inside us to make the hurt go away, and the magicia n can use that impulse to bring about magical change by linking t he removal of the pain to the accomplishment of the intention. An d I don't mean"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"magical masochism. We are creatures of habit who fi nd comfort and security by living our lives in a particular way, and any change to that habit and routine will cause some disco mfort and an opposing desire to return to the original state, a nd that desire can be used. Just as a ritual intends to change the world in some way, so a sacrifice forces us to change ourselves in some way, and that liberates magical energy. If you want to heal someone, don't just do a ritual and leave it at that; becom e involved in caring for them in some way, and that active caring will act as a channel for the healing power you have invoked. I f you want to use magic to help someone out of a mess, provi de them with active, material help as well; conversely, if you can't be bothered to provide material help, your ritual wil l be infected with that same inertia and apathy - \"true will, wi ll out\", and in many cases our true will is to do nothing at all . From a magical perspective each one of us is a magical being with a vast potential of power, but that is denie d to us by an innate, fanatical, and unbelievably deep-rooted d esire to keep the world in a regular orbit serving our own needs. Self- sacrifice disturbs this equilibrium and lets out some of that energy, and this may be why the egoless devotio n and self- sacrifice of saints has a reputation for working mi racles. Step 5: The Main Ritual After invoking the Powers and having stated the intention and sacrifice, there would seem to be nothing mor e to do, but most people like to prolong the contact with the Po wers to carry out some kind of symbolic ritual for a period of time varying from minutes to days. Ritual as I have described it so far may seem like a fairly cut-and-dried exercise, but it isn't; it is more of an art than a science, and once the Circle and Gates are opened, and the Powers are in attendance, whatever science there is gives way to the art. Magicians operate in a wor ld where ordinary things have deep symbolic meanings or correspondenc es, and they use a selection of consecrated implements or \"powe r objects\" in their work. The magician can use this palette of symbols in a ritual to paint of picture which signifies an inten tion in a non- verbal, non-rational way, and it is this ability to communicate an intention through every sense of the body, throu gh every level of the mind, which gives ritual its power. Here are a few suggestions: - each sephira has a corresponding number whic h can be used as the basis for knocks, gestures, chimes, sta mps etc. - each sephira has a corresponding colour whic h can be used throughout the working area: altar cloth , candle(s), banners, flowers, cords etc. - many occult suppliers make sephirothic incenses. The quality is so variable that it is best t o try a few suppliers and apply common sense. - each sephira has corresponding behaviours which can be used during the central part of the ritual."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" - if you are working with several people then they can take their roles from the sephira, and wear corresp onding colours etc. For example, a sentinel would use Gevuric correspondences, a scribe would use Hod corres pondences. - each sephira has ritual weapons or \"power o bjects\" which can be used in a symbolic way. - every sephira has a wide range o f individual correspondences which can be used on specific occasions e.g. a ritual of romantic love in Netzach might use a rose incense, roses, a copper love cup, wine, a poem or song dedicated to Venus, whatever gets you going... Step 6: Dismissal of Powers Once the ritual is complete the Powers are thanked and dismissed. This begins the withdrawal of consciou sness back to its pre-ritual state. Step 7: Close Gates/Close Circle The final steps are closing the Gates (thus se aling off the altered state of consciousness) and closing the Circle (thus returning to the everyday world). The Circle should not be closed if there is a suspicion that the withdrawal from the altered state has not been completed. It is sensible to ca rry out a sanity check between closing the Gates and closin g the Circle. It sometimes happens that although the magician goe s through the steps of closing down, the attention is not enga ged, and the magician remains in the altered state. This is not a good idea. The energy of that state will continue to manif est in every intention of everyday life, and all sorts of unplan ned (and often unusual) things will start to happen. A related pr oblem (and it is not rare) is that every magician will find soone r or later an altered state which compensates for some of th eir perceived inadequacies (in the way that some people like to get drunk at parties), and they will not want to let go of it be cause it makes them feel good, so they come out of the ritual i n an altered state without realising they have failed to close d own correctly. This is sometimes called obsession, and it is a difficulty of magical work. Closing down correctly is important if you don't want to end up like a badly cracked pot. If you do n't feel happy that the Powers have been completely dismissed a nd the Gates closed correctly, go back and repeat the steps agai n. Using the Sephiroth in Ritual ----------------------------- The sephiroth can be invoked during a ritual singly or in combination. This provides a vast palette of corre spondences and symbols to work with, and one of the most difficu lt aspects of planning this kind of ritual is deciding which seph iroth are the key to the problem. It is an axiom of Kabbalisti c magic that every sephira is involved somewhere in every proble m, and it is"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"sometimes difficult to avoid the conclusion t hat all ten sephiroth should be invoked; there is nothing wro ng with doing this, but if one goes the whole hog with colours, candles etc., then the temple begins to look like an explosion in a paint factory, and this tends to dilute the focus of ri tuals if done regularly. A ritual would involve typically one to three sephiroth. An important consideration is balance: when invoking sephiroth on either of the side pillars of the Tree one is creating or correcting in imbalance, and it is worthwhile to consider the balancing sephira. For example, when using Gevurah destructively, what fills the vacuum left behind? When using Ches ed creatively, what gives way for the new? The same principle ap plies to the pairs of Hod/Netzach and Binah/Chokmah. The Tree is naturally arranged in many triads, or groups of three sephiroth, and after one has gained an und erstanding of individual sephira it is natural to go on to in vestigate the triads. From the point of view of balance there is a great deal to be said for initiation into triads of sephiroth rather than individual sephira. The sephiroth are interconnec ted by paths, and again, the paths can be investigated by invok ing pairs of sephiroth. This further extends the palette of c orrespondences and relationships, and over time the Tree becomes a living tool which can be used to analyse situations in gre at depth and detail. Unless one works closely with a group of people over a period of time the Tree must remain largely a perso nal symbol and vocabulary, but if one *does* work closely with ot her people it becomes a shared vocabulary of great expressive and executive power - ideas which would otherwise be inexpres sible can be translated directly and fairly precisely into shar ed action via ritual magic. Clues as to when to invoke a given sephira can found in the correspondences, but for the sake of example I h ave given an indication in a list below: The sephira Malkuth is useful for the following mag ical work: - where you want to increase the stability of a situation. Particularly useful when everything is in a tu rmoil and you want to slow things down. - when you want to earth unwanted or unwelcome energy. Also useful for shielding and warding (think of a c astle). - when working with the four elements in the phy sical world. - when you want an intention to materialise in the physical world; when it is essential that an inte ntion \"really happens\". e.g. it is one thing to write a book, it is another thing to get it printed, published, an d read. - when invoking Gaia, Mother Earth.

The sephira Gevurah is useful for the following mag ical work: - active defense. - destruction. - severance. - justice and lawful retribution. The sephira Chesed is useful for the following magi cal work: - growth and expansion. - vision, leadership and authority (e.g. in business management, in politics). - inspiration and creativity. The sephiroth Gevurah and Chesed are best consider ed as a pair, since any work concerning one usually requires con sideration of the other. For example, if you want something to g row and expand (Chesed), will it grow at the expense of s omething else (Gevurah)? The supernal sephiroth of Binah, Chokmah and Kether can be invoked, but I would not recommend doing so un til you have considerable experience of invoking the other sephi roth - either nothing will happen, or the scope of the results may go beyond your intention. Other Practical Work -------------------- The sephirothic ritual technique described ca n be used to design an enormous variety of rituals quickly and e asily, as the basic format can remain the same. A ritual involvin g Yesod should have an utterly different feel and effect from a ri tual involving Tiphereth, and yet the basic construction of the t wo rituals can be identical. Because a ritual can be quickly car ried out (not necessarily easily, but certainly quickly), sephi rothic ritual can be used to add clout to other magical and mystical"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"techniques, such as meditation, divination, scrying , oath-making, prayer, concentration and visualisation, mediumsh ip and so on. In Conclusion ------------- I wanted to provide in these notes approximat ely the same information as I was given when I began to study Kabbalah. The person who gave me this information said \"You don't need to read lots of books, just go off and do it.\" It was soun d advice. If you want to learn how to build bridges, read books about building bridges, but if you want to learn about yourself, j ust go off and do it. \"Doing It\" consists of invoking the sephiro th and asking to be instructed. It consists of jumping in with b oth feet when something new comes along. It involves trusting y our intuition and conscience. It requires you to question everyt hing. It also requires countless meditations, concentration and visualisation exercises, self-examination, rituals, dream-reco rding, prayer, whatever you want, but there is no prescription f or this, and each person tends to find their own happy medium. As a chronic reader I found the advice about not reading books on magic and Kabbalah hard to take, but I took it, and for some thing like ten years I lost the habit completely. I'm very glad I did. There is almost enough information in these no tes to go off and \"just do it\". The information I have withheld I have done so deliberately, as it consists of little things whi ch any person with a small amount of common sense, initiative and trust in themselves can work out. You don't need to learn o ther peoples' rituals: trust your own imagination and creati vity, however insufficient they might seem, and write your own. You need to trust yourself, and that is why I haven't provided a detailed prescription. If you think Kabbalah sh ould be more complicated, then make it more complicated. If yo u think it is essential to learn about the four worlds, or the parts of the soul, or the beard of Arik Anpin or whatever, the n learn about them, but I don't think it is essential to begin w ith, and there are better and quicker ways of learning than run ning off and buying the \"Zohar\". If you trust in yourself, you w ill learn what you need to know at the rate at which you can learn it. Kabbalah is only a map (but for the record I believe it is a n accurate and useful map), and the entrance to the territory lies within you. In my experience the sephirothic magical ritua ls are the key to everything else. If you are afraid of ritual t hat is fine; lots of people are. If you are afraid of ritual b ut you invoke the Powers with the attitude and respect that is t heir due, and you are not afraid to give freely for what you get, then you will get a great deal, and almost certainly a great deal more than you would have expected.
