[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"SPRA DTzNIOVThA (SIPHRA DTZENIOUTHA); or, THE BOOK OF CONCEALED MYSTERY. M. MacGregor Mathers, tr. (1887) CHAPTER I. 1. Tradition.-\"The Book of Concealed Mystery\" is th e book of the equilibrium of balance. [The word \"Dtzenioutha\" is difficult to translate, but I think its meaning is best expressed by the wo rds \"Concealed Mystery.\" I have explained in the Introduction the qabalistical meaning of the words \"equilibrium\" and \"balance,\" §29] 2. Tradition.- For before there was equilibrium, co untenance beheld not countenance. [By the two countenances are meant Macroprosopus an d Microprosopus. See Introduction, §§42, 47, 64. 65 . 67. 73. and 77.] 3. And the kings of ancient time were dead, and the ir crowns were found no more; and the earth was des olate. (The \"kings of ancient time\" mean the same thing as the \"Edomite Kings;\" that is, they symbolize world s of \"unbalanced force,\" which. according to the Zohar, preceded the formation of this universe. I have exp lained this also in the Introduction, §41 and 56. This and the immediately following sections are supposed to trac e the gradual development of the Deity from negative into positiv e existence; the text is here describing the time w hen the Deity was just commencing His manifestation from His prim al negative form. Therefore, according to the qabal istical ideas, the universe is the garment as it were of th e Deity; He not only contains all, but is Himself a ll. and exists in all.) 4. Until that head (which is incomprehensible) desi red by all desires (proceeding from AIN SVP, Ain So ph, the infinite and limitless one), appeared and communica ted the vestments of honour. [This Head, which is here described as proceeding f rom the infinite and limitless One, the Ain Soph, i s the first Sephira, the Crown Kether. otherwise called Arikh A npin, or Macroprosopus. the Vast Countenance. From this first Sephira the other nine emanations are produced. I h ave explained all this in the Introduction, §38-57, in treating of the Sephiroth.] 5. This equilibrium hangeth in that region which is negatively existent in the Ancient One. [By the expression \"This equilibrium hangeth in tha t region which is negatively existent in the Ancien t One,\" is meant that the other nine Sephiroth (which are equi librated by their formation in trinities) are as ye t not developed in the first Sephira. but exist within it as the tree exists in the seed from which it springs. By \"the A ncient One\" is intended the first Sephira, the Crown Kether. one o f whose appellations is Autkeqa, the Ancient One. F rom this Sephira, as I have before remarked, the idea of neg ative existence depends back towards. the AIN.] 6. Thus were those powers equiponderated which were not yet in perceptible existence. [These powers are the other nine Sephiroth. which a re, as it were. powers of the first Sephira; as soo n as they are equated they become positively existent through cor relation of force. The next two sections explain th e manner of their equilibration while yet negative entities, or rather ideas ] 7. In His form (in the form of the Ancient One) exi steth the equilibrium: it is incomprehensible, it i s unseen. [But the first idea of equilibrium is the Ancient O ne (the first Sephira, or Crown Kether), because it is the first potential limitation of the boundless light which p roceeds from the Limitless One. That is, the centra l point of Kether is the equilibrium, because the balance does not yet exist, the two opposite poles which form t he balance not being yet developed. We must not confuse the two te rms, equilibrium and balance. The balance consists of two scales (Opposing forces), the equilibrium is the ce ntral point of the beam.] 8. Therein have they ascended, and therein do they ascend-they who are not, who are, and who shall be. [Therein (in the equilibrium of Kether) have they a scended (developed when they became positively exis tent), and therein (in the equilibrium) do they ascend (have t heir first existence), they (the Sephiroth) who are not (exist negatively), who are (then become positive), and wh o shall be (exist permanently. because they are cou nterbalanced powers). This triple expression \"am not, are, and s hall be,\" also refers to the triple trinity of the Sephiroth.] (See Introduction. §§ 52. 64, 65 and 66.] 9. The head which is incomprehensible is secret in secret. [This head is Macroprosopus, the Vast Countenance, and is the same as the Ancient One, or Crown Kather . It is secret. for therein are hidden the other potentiali ties.] 10. But it hath been formed and prepared in the lik eness of a cranium, and is filled with the crystall ine dew. [The crystalline dew is the creative lux or Aur. AV R. proceeding from the Limitless One. The Mantuan C odex calls the skull or cranium the first, and the crystalline dew the second conformation of Macroprosopus.] 11. His skin is of ether, clear and congealed."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"12. (His hair is as) most fine wool, floating throu gh the balanced equilibrium. [The ether is the clear and insupportable brillianc eof his glory. The hair is white - i.e.; spotless a s wool-to denote the utter absence of matter and of shell. The Mantuan C odex calls the ether the third conformation. and th e hair the fourth, which latter it refers to the Sephira Netza ch, victory.] 13. (His forehead is) the benevolence of those bene volances which are manifested through the prayers o f the inferior powers. [The supernal benignity which transmits their quali ties, powers and offices, to the lower Sephiroth (t he inferior powers). it must be remembered that each Sephira re ceives frons that which immediately precedes it, an d transmits to that which next follows it. Thus. each Sephira i s said to be feminine or passive as regards its pre decessor, and masculine or active in respect to its successor. (S ee Introduction, §§ 43 and 51.) The Mantuan Codex c alls this the fifth conformation, and refers it to the idea of th e ninth Sephira, Yesod, foundation.) 14. His eye is ever open and sleepeth not, for it c ontinually keepeth watch. And the appearance of the lower is according to the aspect of the higher light. [Were the eye to close (the directing thought Divin e to be abstracted from the Sephiroth), the whole u niverse would give way, for its mainspring would be withdrawn. Be cause the appearance (development) of the lower (ni ne Sephiroth) is according to (dependent on) the aspec t (ruling thought) of the higher light (Kether, the first Sephira). The Mantuan Codex terms this the sixth conformation of Macroprosopus, and refers it, as in the case of the fourth conformation. to the primal idea of the Sephira Net zach, victory.] 15. Therein are His two nostrils like mighty galler ies, whence His spirit rushes forth over all. (The Mantuan Codex adds that this is the seventh conformation, which r efers to MLKVTh, Malkuth, or \"the kingdom,\" the ten th emanation or Sephira of the Deity.) [The creative spirit, or the \" breath of life.\"] 16. (When, therefore, the Divine law beginneth) BRA SHITH BRA ALHIM ATH HSHMIM VATH HARTz, Berashith Bera Elohim Ath Hashamaim Vaath Haaretz: \"In the beginning the Elohim created the substance of the heavens and the substance of the earth.\" (The sense is: Six members were created, which are the six nu merations of Microprosopus-viz., benignity as His right arm; sev erity as His left arm; beauty as His body; victory as His right leg; glory as His left leg; and the foundation as reprod uctive.) For instead of BRASHITH, Berashith, \"in th e beginning,\" it may be read, BRA SHITH, Bera Shith, \"He created the six.\" Upon these depend all things which are be low (principally the Queen, who is the lowest path, or the bride of Microprosopus, and all the three infer ior worlds.) [The view which the Siphra Dtzenioutha here follows out is that the beginning of Genesis describes not only the creation of the world, but the development of God, for it considers the universe as the outward and ma terial expression of the power of the thought Divine. Micr oprosopus is as it were the reflection of Macropros opus, for as Macroprosopus has six principal titles, so is Micro prosopus composed of six of the Sephiroth. (See Int roduction. §§ 42. 47 and 77.) ShITh, Shith, is the Chaldee form o f the Hebrew ShSh, Shash, six. The queen is Malkuth , the tenth Sephira. The three inferior worlds are Briah. Yetzi rah, and Asiah. See Introduction, §§ 57-60.] 17. And the dignity of dignity hangeth from the sev en conformations of the cranium. (This is the beard of the venerable and Ancient One, which is divided into th irteen portions). [The Ancient One is the first Sephim, Macroprosopus , as I have before remarked. The beard, in continua tion of the symbolic representation of the head, is divided int o thirteen portions, which answer by Gernatria (see Introduction, § 11) to the idea of unity. For AChD, Achad, unity, y ields the number 13 by numerical value.] 18. And the second earth came not into the computat ion. (That is, the kingdom of the restored world, w hich elsewhere is called the Bride of Microprosopus, cam e not into the computation when the six members wer e said to be created. Or otherwise, when in Genesis iv. 2 it is said in another way, \"And the earth,\" that earth is not to be understood of which mention hath been first made; s ince by the first is to be understood the kingdom o f the restored world, and by the second the kingdom of the destroy ed world), and this is elsewhere said. [The kingdom of the destroyed world is that of unba lanced force. (See Introduction, §§ 41 and 56. and also note Section 3. foregoing.) This refers to a period prio r to the development of the Sephiroth. and must the refore be referable to the Edomite kings.] 19. And it hath proceeded out of that which hath un dergone the curse, as it is written in Genesis v., 29, \"From the earth which the Lord hath cursed.\" (The meaning is: That the kingdom of the restored world was formed from the kingdom of the destroyed world, wherein seven kings had died and their possessions had been broken up. Or, the explanation of the world, of which mention is made elsewhere, proceedeth from the kingdom of the destr oyed world.) [These seven kings are the Edomite kings before men tioned in Section 3.] 20. It was formless and void, and darkness upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of the Elohim vib rating upon the face of the waters. Thirteen (these words, from \"it was formless\" down to \"of the waters,\" are thirtee n in the Hebrew"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"text of Genesis) depend from the thirteen (forms) o f the dignity of dignity (that is, the beard of the Macroprosopus, or first formed head). [I have before remarked that the number thirteen ex presses unity. The author of \"The Book of Concealed Mystery\" here argues that the very number and order of the w ords in the Hebrew text refer to certain forms of t he Deity. The terms \"face of the deep\" and \"face of the waters\" b ear a striking analogy to Macroprosopus and Micropr osopus, the Vast and the lesser Countenances. In this sense the \"face of (from) the deep (abyss)\" is the countenan ce formed from Ain Soph, the limitless One; namely. the first Seph ira, the Crown Kether.] 21. Six thousand years depend from the six first. T his is what the wise have said, that the world shal l last six thousand years, and it is understood from the six n umbers of Microprosopus. But also the six following words give occasion to this idea: VIAMR ALHIM IHI AVR VIHI AVR , Veyomar Elohim Yehi Aur Vayehi Aur: \"And the Elohim said, Let there be light, and there was ligh t.\" [By an exegetical rule of numbers, not so often emp loyed as the others. simple numbers or units signif y divine things; numbers of ten, celestial things; numbers o f a hundred, terrestrial things; and thousands sign ify the future. what shall be in an after-age. Hence are the \"six t housand years\" deduced from the six first words, wh ich also are said to refer to the six Sephiroth of whom Micropro sopus is formed; the idea of six being extended int o as many thousands, to symbolise that number on the plane of a future age.) 22. The seventh (the millennium, and the seventh sp ace, namely, the Kingdom), above that One which alo ne is powerful- (i.e., when the six degrees of the member s denote mercies and judgments, the seventh degree tendeth alone to judgment and rigour). And the whole is des olate (that is, the Kingdom, MLKVTH, Malkuth, in th e higher powers, is the antitype of the sanctuary, and like as this is destroyed, so also the Schechinah, or Ki ngdom, is itself exiled) for twelve hours (for the Hebrews include a ll this time of their exile in the space of one day ). Like as it is written: \"It was formless and void, &c.\" (for from the word \"it was formless,\" down to \"upon the faces of,\" are twelve words in the Hebrew text of Genesis.) [By the same rule, the millennium is deduced from t he seventh word. The seventh space here means Malku th, the kingdom, or the queen, which together with the six of Microprosopus, makes up the seven lower Sephirot h. (See Introduction, § 77. further. for the idea of the ba lance of mercy and judgment.)] 23. The thirteenth (that is, \"of the waters,\" HMIM, Hamim, which is the thirteenth word) raiseth up th ese (that is, as well the sanctuary which is above as that which is below) through mercy (since the water symbolizeth t hat measure of mercy through which judgment and punishments are mitigated), and they are renewed as before (for th e six words follow afresh, as in the beginning the six members are enumerated). For all those six continue and sta nd fast (they are the members of the Microprosopus, and are not a s his bride, and from them is the restitution), sin ce it is written BRA, Bera, \"created\" (which hath a sense of permane nce), and then it is written HIThH, Hayitha, \"it wa s\" (which also is a phrase of permanence and not of interpola tion), for it is very truth (plainly, therefore, th e kingdom perished not, although it might be formless and void, but it retaineth hitherto the essence). [Mercy and judgment are opposites, and from the sid e of judgment comes the execution of judgment, whic h is destruction.] 24. And at the end of the Formless and the Void and the Darkness (that is, at the end of the exile thi s saying shall have place: Isa. ii. 11). And the Tetragrammaton al one shall be exalted in that day (that is, in the t ime ot Messiah). [The Tetragrammaton (see Introduction, § 67) compre hends the whole ten Sephiroth, and consequently exp resses their three trinities of balanced force also; conse quently, when the Tetragrammaton appears, the forml ess and the void and the darkness disappear, and form, fulness, and light replace them.] 25. But there are excavations of excavations. (The excavation is the receptacle, like that which is ho llowed out, or carved out, like a cave, or any other receptacle. T herefore all receptacles are inferior with respect to the superiors, among which the \"shells\" hold the last place, which here are described, which are) under the form of a vast serpent extending this way and that. (Concerning this serpe nt the author of the \"Royal Valley \" speaks thus in his \"Treatise of the Shells.\" The fragments of the receptacles, w hich have fallen into the world of Creation, of For mation, and of Action, therein exist from the Outer; and judgments are more consonant to these, which are called prof ane, and have their habitation in the middle space between the Ho ly and the Unclean. And from the head is formed tha t great dragon which is in the sea, and is the sea-serpent, which is, however, not so harmful as the earthly o ne. And this dragon hath been castrated since his crest (or memb rum genitale), together with his mate, have been re pressed, and thence have been formed four hundred desirable worl ds. And this dragon hath in his head a nostril (aft er the manner of whales) in order that he may receive influence, and in himself he containeth all other dragons, con cerning which it is said: \"Thou hast broken the heads of the drag ons upon the waters\" (Ps. lxxiv. 13). And here the idea or universal form of all the shells is understood, which encompa sseth the seven inferior emanations of the queen af ter the manner of a serpent, as well from the right as from the le ft and from every side.)"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"[The excavation or receptacle of a Sephira is that quality whereby it receives the supernal influence from that which immediately precedes it; hence each Sephira has a d ouble quality of receiving and of transmitting. whi ch passes through the four voids, in each of which the Sephir oth exist, though in gradually decreasing light. (S ee Table subjoined.) The \"shells,\" Qlisoth, are the demons, in whom again is a form of the Sephiroth, distorted and averse. This great dragon which is here described is eviden tly identical with the leviathan of Job. He is the executor of judgment. the centripetal force, the old serpent ev er seeking to penetrate into Paradise; finally, in a more exoteric sense he is Satan and the devil, the accusing one. In the Sepher Yetzirah, a most important qabalistic al book, he is called Theli, ThLI, the dragon. Now, by Gematria, T hLI = 400 + 30 + 10 = 440; and if we \"repress his c rest\" -i.e., take away the first letter, which is Th, Tau,-400, there will remain LI=4o=M, Mem, the water. The \"400 desirable worlds\" are the numerical value of Th, and signify the power of the Tetragrammaton on the material pla ne (See note to section 21, foregoing). There is much alchemical symbolism contained in the \"Siphra Dtzenioutha.\" T he \"Seven Inferior Emanations\" of the queen, are the seven lo wer Sephiroth -viz., Chesed, Geburah, Tiphereth, Ne tzach, Hod, Yesod, and Malkuth; or Microprosopus and his bride, the king and queen. \"Shells,\" Qliphoth, are the ev il spirits.] 26. His tail is in his head (that is, he holdeth hi s tail in his mouth, in order that he may form a ci rcle, since he is said to encompass holiness). He transferreth his head to behind the shoulders (that is, he raiseth his head at the back of the bride of Microprosopus, where is the place ot m ost severe judgments), and he is despised (since in him is the extremity of judgments and severities, whence wrath is the attribute of his forms). He watcheth (that is, he accurately searcheth out and seeketh in what place he may gain an entry into holiness. And he is conce aled (as if laying traps; since he insinuateth himself into the inferiors, by whose sins he hath access to the hol y grades, where the carrying out of judgments is committed to him.) He is manifested in one of the thousand shorter da ys. (Numbers are called days, and numbers of the inferior world short days; among which tens are attributed to the factive, on account of their decimal numeration; hundreds to th e formative, since they are numbers of the light of their author, and draw their existence from the tens; but thousan ds to the creative, for the same reason. But that d ragon hath about this his most powerful location, whence, if a defec t occurreth only in one numeration of that system t hrough the fault of the inferiors, he is immediately manifest, and t hus commenceth his accusations before the throne of glory.) [Here is the origin of the well-known symbol of a s erpent holding his tail in his mouth, like a circle -the serpent of Saturn. The reason that he raiseth his head behind the shoulders of the bride (Malkuth) is because he is. so to speak, not only the executor of judgment, but also the des troyer; destruction as opposed to creation, death a s opposed to life. For the whole Sephiroth are represented as be ing the balance of mercy and justice, and the tenth Sephira is especially of the nature of justice, as also is Geb urah, the fifth. He is concealed, because he is not called into action till justice requires him. The term \"decimal numera tion\" of course refers to the ten Sephiroth. The pr esence of the serpent when revealed, is an accusation, because it shows that the balance is destroyed; just as in a watch, if one of the wheels be injured. irregularity is at once mani fested. Now, life, when it consists of birth into a nother form, necessarily implies death in the previous form. The throne of glory is the Briatic world.] 27. There are swellings in his scales (that is, lik e as in a crocodile; because great in him is the he aping together of judgments). His crest keepeth its own place (that i s, there is in him no further power of hastening to things beyond in the Outer). [There is in the destroyer no \"hastening to the out er,\" because he is centripetal and not centrifugal. ) 28. But his head is broken by the waters of the gre at sea. (The great sea is wisdom, the fountain of m ercy and loving-kindness; which, if it sendeth down its infl uence, judgments are pacified, and the hurtful powe r of the shells is restricted); like as it is written, Ps. lxxiv. 1 3: \"Thou hast broken the heads of the dragons by th e waters.\" [\"The waters of the great sea.\" are the influence o f the supernal mother, Binah, of whom Malkuth is th e reflection. But Binah receives the influence of Chokmah. See In troduction.] 29. They were two (male and female, whence the text of the Psalm speaketh of the dragons in the plural number; but when the plural number is given in its least form, two only are understood). They are reduced into one (for the female leviathan hath been slain, lest they should seek to multiply judgments). Whence the word ThNINM , Thenanim (in the before-mentioned passage of the Ps alm), is written in a defective form (purposely to denote that restriction). [I may refer the reader to the Talmud forfurther in formation regarding Jewish ideas of the Leviathan. Thenanim is. written in a defective form, because the letter I o f the plural is omitted. Written fully, it should b e ThNINIM, instead of ThNINM.] 30. (But it is said) heads (in the plural number, f or the purpose of denoting a vast multitude, as wel l of species as of individuals in that genus); like as it is written, Ezek. i. 22: \"And a likeness as a firmament above t he heads of the living creature.\" (Where also the word living creat ure, ChIH, Chiah, is put in the singular as a genus of angels; and heads in the plural for the purpose of denoting spe cies and innumerable individuals.)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"[\"Thou hast broken the heads of the dragons (Thenan im) by the waters.\" It must be remembered that this dragon is said by the author of the \" Royal Valley \" to be th e king of all the \"shells\" or demons. Now, the demo ns are divided into ten classes, corresponding to the ten Sephirot h, but in an averse form, and are called in the boo k, \"Beth Elohim,\" the \"impure Sephiroth.\" The heads of the l eviathan (cf. the Lernæn Hydra which Hercules slew) are probably these. Compare the description of the beas t in Revelation.] 31. \"And the Elohim said, let there be light, and t here was light.\" (The sense may be sought from that Psalm xxxiii. 9) where it is written, \"Since He Himself spake, an d it was done.\" (First, therefore, is commemorated) the Path HVA, Hoa, (that is, the mother of understanding, wh o is called ALHIM, Elohim, near the beginning of th e verse. \"And the Elohim said.\" She also is called HVA, Hoa, in the words of Psalm xxxiii. 9, on account of her truly secret nature) is alone (as well with Moses as with David) . The word VIHI, Vayehi, \"and it was done,\" is also alone. (As if the six members were considered separately, seeing that V, Vau, occupieth the first place in the word VIHI, Vayehi. [This statement, that the supernal mother symbolize d by the word Hoa, He, seems at first sight at vari ance with the statement in another place, that Hoa represents Mac roprosopus. But the letter H in the Tetragrammaton symbolizes the supernal mother, and this is also the initial l etter of Hoa. And again by Gematria (see Introducti on) Hoa, HVA=5+6+1=12, and the digits of 12 1+2=3. And 3 sym bolizes Binah because she is the third Sephira. \"Se eing that V, Vau, occupies the first place in the word VIHI,\" because V stands for the number 6. See Table of th e Alphabet, &c., in Introduction.) 32. Then are the letters inverted, and become one. (If, namely, in the word VIHI, Vayehi, the letters I, Yod, and H, He, be placed in front so that it may read IHVI, Ya hevi, it maketh one Tetragrammaton, which exhaustet h the whole Divinity. But since these belong to the mother, fro m whom arise the judgments, hence this tetragrammat on is here written in retrograde order, which mode of writing is referred by qabalists to the judgments, on accou nt of the nature of averse things; whence this ought to be written i n this way: IHVI, Yahevi, IHV, Yeho, IH, Yah, I, Yo d. But since in the path of understanding those judgments themse lves do not exist, but only their roots, while in i tself this path is only pure mercy; hence the retrograde order is inve rted, in order that it may be posited entire in thi s manner as at first): I, Yod, IH, Yah, IHV, Yeho, IHVI, Yahevi. ( But it is not written in the usual manner, IHVH, Yo d, He, Vau, He; because the word is derived from VIHI, Vayehi, whose metathesis is here discussed. And nevertheles s the letter) which is last (namely, I, Yod, which is put in the place of the last H, He, in the ordinary form of th e Tetragrammaton, denoteth), the Schechinah (or the q ueenly presence) which is below (that is, a path of the kingdom, namely, MLKVTh, Malkuth, the tenth and last Sephira ); like as (in the other instance) the letter H, He , is found to be the Schechinah. [The reader will be utterly unable to follow the re asoning in this section, unless he reads carefully what I have said in the Introduction concerning the Literal Qabalah under the heads of Notariqon and Temurah, to which therefore I refer him. Any four-lettered name is of course a te tragrammaton, but this term is especially applied t o the word of four letters called by biblical translators Jehovah . It must be remembered that the natural course of writing Hebrew and Chaldee is from right to left, and that when it is written from left to right, it is said to be wr itten \"backwards,\" \"in retrograde order.\" or \"averse.\" By the \"path of understanding \" is meant Binah, the third Sephira. Schechinah is of course the Divine Presence manifested in the pat h of Malkuth I have explained in the Introduction t he meaning of the term \"path\" as employed in the Zohar.] 33. But in one balance are they equiponderated. (Th e balance denoteth the male and the female; and the meaning is, that the letters I, Yod, and H, He - of which the f ormer is masculine and referreth to the path of the foundation; and the latter is feminine, pertaining to the queen-are interchangeable; since whilst the equilibrium exis teth there is an intercomunication between them, and they are joined together as one. Add to this that the queen is als o called ADNI, Adenai, wherein the letter I, Yod, bringeth up the rearguard of the army, as it were; because also it is accustomed to be called, the Lesser Wisdom.) And the living creat ures rush forth and return. (This is what is said i n Ezek. i. 14 concerning the living creatures, which it is accust omed to be said concerning those letters of the Tet ragrammaton, which sometimes hold the last place and sometimes t he first; as when I, Yod, rusheth forth unto the la st place, and when it returneth unto the beginning again; and so also the letter H, He. Likewise, then, also the liv ing creatures are said to rush forth, when the Tetragrammaton is writ ten with the final H, He, because then the whole sy stem of emanatives is exhausted. But they are said to retur n when the Tetragrammaton is written with the final I, Yod, so that the sense may be collected in such a manner as to return from the last path of the queen into the penultimate of the foundation, which is designated by this letter I, Yod. [I have defined \"balance\" in the 1ntroduction, § 29 , which see. The \"path of the foundation \" is of co urse Yesod, the ninth Sephira, while the queen is Malkuth. the tent h. Yesod is therefore the connecting link between t he Microprosopus and the bride. The letter I \"bringeth up the rearguard as it were\" in the name ADNI, Ado naï. because it is the last letter. Ezek, i. 14: the Qabalists b y the term ChIVTH HQDSH, Chaivoth Ha-Qadesch, the H oly Living- Creatures, understand the letters of the Tetragramm aton. With regard to the \"letters of the Tetragramm aton, which"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"sometimes hold the last place and sometimes the fir st,\" the following are two examples - namely, as in the form IHVI, Yod. He, Vau, Yod, the letter I, Yod, is both at the beginning and end of the word; and in the f orm which is more usual IHVH, Yed, He, Vau, He, the letter H, He . is in the second and last place.) 34. Like as it is written: \"And the Elohim saw the substance of the light, that it was good. (Here a r eason is adduced from the proposed text itself, showing how the last letter of this form of the Tetragrammaton, namely, I, Yod, may be said to symbolize the bride, since God himself m ight behold in that light the path of conjunctive f oundation, which the word \"goodness\" pointeth out; but when th e foundation is in the act of conjunction - that is , under the idea of communicating goodness - there then is the bride . But also that the word \"goodness\" denoteth the fo undation is proved from Isa. iii. 10, where it is said, \"Say ye unto the righteous man\" (that is, to the path of f oundation, because the first man is said to be the foundation of the w orld, Prov. x. 25), \"that it shall be well with him .\" Therefore, then do they ascend within the equilibrium. (That is, th ese two letters, I, Yod, and H, He, mean one and th e same thing. Or, again: But behold, how in balanced power ascend the letters of Tetragrammaton. That is, how those letters agree when in conjunction, which before were standing sep arated in the word VIHI, Vayehi.) [The \"path of foundation\" is of course the ninth Se phim. Yesod, which is the sixth member of Micropros opus (see section 16. foregoing). and typifies reproductive p ower. Maikuth is the queen. We must remember that i n the Tetragrammaton. IHVH, I, Yod is the father (who is not Macroprosopus, though he is implied therein, as the top point of the Hebrew letter Yod is said to symbolize him); H, He. the supernal mother; V, Vau, the son (Microprosopus); and H. He, final, the bride (the q ueen). And this is their proper order. Other variat ions of the Tetragrammaton. therefore, alter the position of th e letters with regard to each other; their normal a nd correct position being IHVH.] 35 (Whilst the spouse, Microprosopus) was at first alone (he was standing by, whilst the letter V, Vau , occupied the first place, then was he separated from his bride). But all things returned into the unity. (That is, not only were father and mother conjoined into one, because the two lett ers, I, Yod, and H, He, were combined; but also the Microprosopus returned to his bride, whilst V, Vau, was placed next to I, Yod, in the Tetragrammaton, IHVI, Yahevi. For) V, Vau, descendeth (when in the word V IHI, Vayehi, \"and it was done,\" it occupieth the fi rst place; but in the proposed metathesis it descended into the th ird place, in order that it might be IHVI, Yahevi). And they are bound together the one to the other (male and femal e, V, Vau, and I, Yod, the path of beauty and the q ueen), namely, I, Yod, and H, He (by which are shown wisdo m and knowledge, father and mother), like unto two lovers who embrace each other. (By two lovers are understo od either V, Van, and I, Yod, only-that is, at the end; or I, Yod, and H, He, together-that is, at the beginning). [The \"path of beauty,\" or Tiphereth. the sixth Seph ira, is sometimes represented by V, Van, and theref ore sometimes stands for Microprosopus by itself; it is really th e central Sephira of the group of six Sephiroth whi ch compose him. The numerical value of Vau is 6.] 36. (Now the author of the \"Siphra Dtzenioutha\" has teneth to the latter explanation of these letters, I, Yod, and V, Van; and concerning V, Van, he saith): Six members are produced from the branch of the root of his bod y. (The body is Microprosopus; the root of the body is the mother, who is symbolized by the letter H, He; the branch of the root is the letter V, Yau, enclosed and hidden with in the letter H, He; and from that very branch were produced the six members - that is, the entire letter V, Van, no w having obtained the head.) [The mother here mentioned is of course the third S ephira. Binah. The six members of Microprosopus for ming the entire letter Vau is an allusion to the numerical v alue of that letter being 6.] 37. \"The tongue speaketh great things\" (see Dan. vi i, 8. And by the tongue is understood the foundatio n -namely, the letter I, Yod, joined with his bride; the speech is the marital influx flowing forth from the bride; f or the queen is called the word; but the great things are the infer iors of all grades produced.) [The inferiors of all \"grades \" or \"paths\" are the Sephiroth in the inferior worlds.] 38. This tongue is hidden between I, Yod, and H, He . (For father and mother are perpetually conjoined in ISVD, Yesod, the foundation, but concealed under the myst ery of Daath or of knowledge.) [The conjunction of the letters V and H at the end of the Tetragrammaton IHVH is similar to that of I and H at the beginning.] 39. Because it is written (Isa. xliv. 5): \"That man shall say, I am of the Tetragrammaton.\" (The word ANI, Ani, I, when the discourse is concerning judgments, pertain eth to the queen. But whensoever mercy is introduce d it referreth to the understanding, like as in this pla ce. In order that the sense may be: The supernal pa th, which is called I, or the understanding in act of conjunction with the father, is for the purpose of the formation of the Tetragrammaton, and this is one conjunction between the father and the mother for the constitution of the six members.) And that shall be called by the name Jaco b, IOQB, Yaqob. (To call by name is to preserve; an d another conjunction of father and mother is introduced for the purpose of preserving the Microprosopus, which is called Jacob.) And that man shall write with his hand, \"I am the Lord's.\" (To write belongeth to the written law, or the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"beautiful path, and the same also signifieth to flo w in. \"With his hand,\" BIDV, Byodo, is by metathesi s BIVD, Byod, by I, Yod-that is, through the foundation; in order that the sense may be, it may be formed from his influx, so that the Tetragrammaton may be written with I, Yod, as we have above said.) And by the name of Israel shall he call himself. He shall call himself thus in truth. (For the conception of the Microprosopus is more properl y under the name of Jacob, whose wife is Rachel; and his cognom en, as it were, is Israel, whose wife is Leah.) [The understanding is Binan, the third Sephira. whi ch is referred to the supernal H, He, The \"beautifu l path\" is Tiphereth, the sixth. The foundation is Yesod, the ninth. It is the final Yod, I, of the form of the T etragrammaton IHVI. which is referred to Yesod, and not the initi al, which belongs to Chokmah, the second Sephira, t he Father.] 40. That man shall say, I am the Lord's; he descend eth. (That is: that very conception of the word I, which is elsewhere attributed to the supernal mother, forasm uch as in her agree the three letters of the word A NI, Ani, I; namely A, Aleph, is the highest crown; N, Nun, is t he understanding itself, in its fifty celebrated ga tes; I, Yod, is the foundation or knowledge of the Father; but in this instance it is attributed to the lowest grade of th e lower mother, and now is ADNI, Adonaï, without the D, Daleth, D, or poverty, but filled with the influx, and is ANI, Ani.) And all things are called BIDV, Byodo (that is, all these t hings are applied to IVD, Yod, concerning which thi s discourse is.) All things cohere by the tongue, which is concealed in the mother. (That is, through Daath, or knowled ge, whereby wisdom is combined with the understanding, and the beautiful path with his bride the queen -, and this is the concealed idea, or soul, pervading the whole emanat ion.) Since this is opened for that which proceedet h from itself (that is, Daath is itself the beautiful path, but a lso the inner, whereto Moses referreth; and that pa th lieth hid within the mother, and is the medium of its conjunction. B ut whensoever it is considered in the outer, when i t hath come forth from the mother, then is it called Jacob.) [The reader is referred to the Introduction for the names, &c., of the Sephiroth. Nun in its fifty gat es refers to the numerical value of the letter N, which is 50. The \" lower mother\" is of course the final H of the word IHVH. the \"bride.\" Daath, generally symbolizes the conjunctio n of the second and third Sephiroth.] 41. (And herein IHV Yod, He, Vau, differeth from, t he whole name and from all the four letters. Now, h e turneth back to the other portion of the four-namely, IHV, Yod, He, Vau-and saith:) The Father resideth in the beginning (that is, that the letter I, Yod, which is the symb ol of the wisdom and of the father, in that part ho ldeth the first place, like as in the whole system; since the crown nevert heless is hidden, and is only compared to the highe st apex of the letter I, Yod). The mother in the middle (for the l etter H, Hi, which is the symbol of the unformed un derstanding and the supernal mother, holdeth the middle place betwe en I, Yod, and V, Vau, even as in the supernals she is comprehended by the Father from above, and by the M icroprosopus, which is her son, she is covered from below, in whom she sendeth herself downward into the Dath of Hod, or of glory.) And she is covered on this side and on that (by the two, father and son). Woe, woe unto him who revealeth their nakedness! (Since this can be done by the faults of the inferiors, so that Microprosopus lose th this influx, whereby he is of so great power tha t he can seek to enshroud his mother; for that covering is the recep tion of the supernal influx, and the capability of transmitting the same to the inferiors, which cannot he done if the mother be uncovered and taken away from the Micropr osopus, as the Israelites did when they committed the sin of t he calf. [IHV is of course the Tetragrammaton without the fi nal H. It is interesting to note that in the qabali stical work called the \"Sepher Yetzirah,\" this trigrammatic name is us ed instead of the Tetragrammaton. The crown which i s hidden is Kether, the first Sephira, or Macroprosopus, who is AHIH, and is therefore not openly shown in IHVH. T he path of Hod is Ehe eighth Sephira. The father and the son, by whom the mother is enclosed, are of course the l etters I and V in the word IHV. With regard to what is said regard ing the Israelites when they committed the sin of t he calf, I imagine that it is intended to intimate-(a) That th e calf as a symbol of ALHIM, Elohim, not of IHVH; f or the Israelites had said, Make us Elohim to go before us .\" (b) That this name \"Elohim\" is applied to the fe minine portion of the Tetragrammaton HH. (c) That therefore the fo rce was unbalanced which they adored, and that it w ould have been just as wrong to adore IV alone.] 42. And God said, let there be MARTh, Maroth, light s in the firmament of the heaven. (Now he hasteneth to the third part of that quadrilateral name, namely, to t hese two letters IH, Yod, He. But by lights are und erstood the sun and the moon, the beautiful path and the kingdom or bride. And herein the sense is this: although usua lly by these two letters are accustomed to be understood the Fat her and the Mother, or the wisdom and the understan ding, yet in this place the supernal lights are wanting, like as the word MARTh, Maroth, is written in a defective form; and the meaning is proper to be applied unto the firmament of the heaven- that is, to the foundation, extended and prepared for marital conjunction; for the spouse is called t he heaven, and the member of the treaty is the firm ament, like, as, therefore, the two last paths in the whole name IHV I, Yod, He, Vau, Yod are designated by the letters V, Vau, and I, Yod, so likewise these in this portion of the squar e are designated by the letters, I, Yod, and H, He. ) The husband hath dominion over the wife (since it is not writte n by V, Vau, but by I, Yod, which is the symbol of the member of the treaty, and herein denoteth the actual combinat ion with the female): like as it is written (Prov. x. 25): \"And the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"just man is the foundation of the world.\" (By this saying he illustrateth his meaning; because by the letter I, Yod, is understood the fundamental member by which the worl d is preserved in'existence.) [If the reader refers to the Introduction, he will there find in the Table showing the operation of th e Sephiroth in the four worlds. &c., that in the world of Asiah the su n is referred to Tiphereth and the moon to Yesod. F urthermore, the circumstance of certain words being written defecti vely or redundantly is commented on in the Introduc tion, § 15. The term \"square,\" or \"square name.\" is sometimes a pplied to the Tetragrammaton. The phrase \"member of the treaty\" probably alludes to the symbolism of circum cision. In this sense. I, Yod. in the path of Yesod , the ninth Sephira, has a symbolical phallic signification.] 43. I, Yod, therefore irradiateth two. (That is, th e letter I, Yod, in this square of the Tetragrammat on hath a double sense of influx, forasmuch as in the first instance it signifieth the father who illuminateth the moth er; and forasmuch as in the second instance it signifieth the Micropr osopus, or rather his treaty, which illuminateth th e kingdom.) And (again in another manner) it shineth (that is, and also hath a third signification, whilst in the comp lete name it constituteth the last letter), and passeth on into the woman. That is, and denoteth the bride of Micro prosopus, as is shown above, because it is put in the place of the last H, He, of the Tetragrammaton IHVH; like as als o it hath the same power of signification in the connection of th e names of existence and domination in this manner, IAChD, VNHI.) 44. (Now he turneth to the last part of this square , which is I, Yod, alone, and saith), I, Yod, remai neth one and alone (in order that it may show that all flow out from t he one single letter I, Yod, which is in the form o f a point, yet partaking of three parts, concerning which see else where; yet in this place denoting only the woman, o r the kingdom, wherein are contained all the supernals.). [Yod at the end of the Tetragrammaton denotes the s ynthesis, the circular movement by which the and re turns to the beginning. In the secret qabalistical alphabet know n as the \"celestial alphabet,\" Yod is represented b y three circles at the angles of an equilateral triangle with the apex uppermost. Malkuth, the tenth Sephira, of course r eceives the influx of all the other Sephiroth (see Table showin g the reception and transmission of the Sephiroth i n the four worlds.] 45. And then (if now the Tetragrammaton be not cons idered in the manner just described, but in this ma nner of instituting the square, IHVI, IHV, IH, I, then Yod also is in a certain sense solitary, but in a plain ly contrary sense. For it ascendeth in its path upwards and upwards. ( That is, it doth not so much receive the higher sen se, in order that it may denote the beautiful path or the foundation; but the highest, that is, the father or the wisdom .) The woman is again hidden. (That is, in this instance, the forme r meaning by which it denoted the bride of Micropro sopus, namely, the last letter of the above-written form of the Te tragrammaton, ceaseth in itself.) [This is in the converse manner. The letter I no lo nger signifies the bride when it ceases to be the f inal letter of a Tetragrammaton.] 46. And the mother is illuminated (that is, in the second part of the ordinary averse Tetragrammaton, which consists of the letters IH, to the letter I, Yod, which hath the signification of the father, is added the lett er H, He, which is the mother, and because these two are combined by thems elves, hence that luminous influence is denoted whe rewith the understanding is imbued by the supernal wisdom); an d is opened out into her gates (that is, if these t wo letters be bound closely together, then out of the dead the pe ntad originateth the number So, by which are denote d the fifty gates of the understanding; these are said to be op ened because the letter H, He, is last and upprotec ted, not being shut in by any other succeeding letter.) [This is taking the letters IH separate from the re st of the Tetragrammaton, but themselves conjoined. And as I=10 and H=5, these two conjoined (multiplied together) give N=50. And these are the fifty gates or propert ies of the understanding. These are opened, because in the wor d IH, Yah, the letter H is last, not being shut in, as by VH in the Tetragrammaton IHVH, or V in the trigram IHV.] 47. The key is added which containeth six, and clos eth its gate. (That is, in the third part of this a verse form, which is IHV, the letter H is not altogether the last; bu t V, the third letter of the Tetragrainmaton, close th it in on the other side, whereby are denoted the six members of the Mi croprosopus, superinvesting the six members of the mother in such a manner that her last gate, which is the path of glory, HVD, Hod, is closed, and combined with t he remainder, which are-Benignity, Severity, Beauty, Victory; dra wing their existence singly out of the decad.) [In the Trigram IHV, V may be called the key, becau se it closeth the fifty gates symbolized by IH, by coming next to H, so as to close or shut in that letter between itself and L By \"the decad \" is meant the ten Seph iroth, which are symbolized by the numerical valae of 1. which is 10 .] 48. And it applieth to the inferiors and to this pa rt. (Or, as others read, \"it applieth to this side and to that.\" Now, the discourse is concerning the fourth part of the squa re, where the name is complete, whether written as H or as I in the last path; so that, nevertheless, the bride of Micr oprosopus may be added. Therefore on either side ha th Microprosopus a connecting link, for he superinvest eth the mother from the supernal part, so that he m ay receive her"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"into himself as his soul; and he also again is cove red by his bride from the inferior part, so that he in his turn may himself become her soul.) [The bride, the inferior H, He, is said to be a ref lection of the mother, the supernal H, He, in the T etragrammaton; just as Microprosopus is said to be the reflection of Macroprosopus.] 49. Woe unto him who shall open her gate! (The gate s are said to be paths through which influence rush eth forth; they are said to be closed, because, on the other h and, too much influence cannot be taken away from t he inferiors; wherefore the members are said to be overshadowed b y the members, so that the light may diminish in it s transit. But when those very concatenations and cobibitions of the lights are separated by the sins of the infe riors, no influx can come into the universe in a proper manner.) [Following out the symbol of the equilibrium in the Sephiroth, the sin of the inferior paths would be the introduction of unbalanced force. The reader will at first find a little difficulty in following the reasoning of t hese last few sections, but after reading them over once or twice , their meaning will seem clearer to him.] CHAPTER II. 1. THE beard of truth. (That is, now followeth a de scription of the beard of Macroprosopus, and its th irteen parts, which are more fully described in the \"Idra Rabba.\" ) [The beard is the influx which descends from the fi rst Sephira through all the others. Macroprosopus i s of course, as I have fully explained in the Introduction, the fir st Sephira, Kether, or the crown also called the An cient One.] 2. Of the beard mention hath not been made. (The co rrect Mantuan Codex hath this correction, so that t he word DQNA, Deqena, is here inserted in the original text . The meaning is, that Solomon in the \"Song of Song s\" maketh mention of all the other members, but not of the be ard.) Because this is the ornament of all. (It is c alled an ornament because it covereth the rest, just as a garment whi ch ornamenteth the body covereth that. But this bea rd covereth not only the Macroprosopus, but also the father and the mother, and descendeth even unto Microprosopus. Wh ence, on account of the communication of so copious a light, it hath also itself been clothed as with a garment with the great reverence of silence.) [By this beard, covering \"not only Macroprosopus, b ut also the father and the mother.\" is meant that, while it is an important attribute of Macroprosopus (who is, be it carefully remembered by the reader Eheieh, AHIH, a nd not IHVH. in which latter name he is only alluded to as -the uppermost point of the letter I, Yod\"), it al so extends through the Sephiroth, for it covers the father and the mother (ie., the second Sephira, Chokmah, wisd om, and ihe third Sephira, Binah, understanding, the IH of IHVH ). Thus, therefore, though proper;y speaking a part of AHIH, and not of IHVH, it extends through the Tetragramma ton IHVH, for it \"descendeth even unto Microprosopu s,\" the next six Sephiroth, the V of IHVH.] 3. From the ears it proceedeth about the circumfere nce of the open space; the white locks ascend and d escend. Into thirteen portions it is distributed in adornment. ( Of all these see the explanation in the \"Idra Rabba \" and \"Idra Zuta.\") [These thirteen divisions of the beard of Macropros opus are all descanted upon at length in both the \" Greater\" and \"Lesser Holy Assembly,\" in the first mentioned of w hich a chapter is devoted to the consideration of e ach division. I therefore shall not need to enter into the subject here, as the reader will find all the information h e requires in the latter part of this volume. By Gematria (see Introd uction). the word AChD, Achad, one, unity=13. The b eard therefore is a glyph of the unity.] 4. Concerning that ornamentation it is written (Jer . ii. 6): \"No man passed through it; and where no m an dwelt.\" Man is without, man is not included therein; much less the male. [The verse runs in the English version: \"Through a land that no man passed through, and where no man d welt.\"] 5. Through thirteen springs are the fountains distr ibuced (by which there is an influx upon Microproso pus and the inferiors). Four are separately joined together, bu t nine flow upon the body (or, as others read, by a dvice of the correct Mantuan Codex), encircle the garden (that i s, the Microprosopus). [The four, separately joined, probably refer to the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, and the nine t o the last nine Sephiroth - i.e., exclusive of Kether. The Garden, or Paradise, is another term expressive of the whol e Sephirotic system in Atziloth. tne archetypal world.] 6. This ornamentation beginneth to be formed before the gate of the ears. 7. It descendeth in beauty into the beginning of th e lips; from this beginning into that beginning. 8. There existeth a path which goeth out beneath th e two galleries of the nostrils, in order that he m ay seek to pass over transgression; like as it is written, Prov. xi x. 11 \"And it is glory to pass over a transgression .\" [The parting of the moustache on the centre of the upper lip. \"It is his glory to pass over a transgre ssion.\"] 9. Beneath the lips the beard goeth about into anot her beginning. 10. Beneath that another path goeth forth. 11. It covereth the approaches to the aromatic begi nning which is above."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"12. Two apples are beheld, to illuminate the lights . [The two ,apples.\" or \"apple-trees.\" are the cheeks . Compare with this the imagery of the Song of Solo mon.] 13. The influence of all floweth down as far as the heart (therein hang suspended the superiors and th e inferiors). 14. Among those locks which hang down, none shineth forth above another. 15. The lesser cover the throat like an ornament; t he greater are restored to perfect proportion. 16. The lips are free on every side. Blessed is he who shall become the receiver of their kisses. 17. In that influence of all stream down thirteen d rops of most pure balm. 18. In this influence all things exist and are conc ealed. 19. At that time, when the seventh month draweth ni gh, those months shall be found to be thirteen (for in the Codex, so often said to be correct, this word ThRISR, Thar isar, or twelve, is expunged; as if it were then sh own to be a year of thirteen months, according to the number of thos e thirteen divisions of the influence) in the super nal world, and the thirteen gates of mercy are opened. At that tim e (by which principally the day of expiation is mea nt, according to that passage of Isaiah, iv. 6): \"Seek ye the Lord w hile He can be found.\" [The \"thirteen divisions of the influence in the su pernal world\" are of course these thirteen parts of the beard of Macroprosopus considered in the sense of Atziloth, the archetypal world, the habitation of the pure Se phiroth alone: \"Seek ye the LORD while he may be found.\"] 20. It is written, Gen. i. 11.: \"And the Lord said, Let the earth bring forth germination; (let there be) grass yielding seed.\" (If here the word IHI, Yehi, \"let there be,\" be inserted, they make nine words.) This is that w hich is written. \"And humble your bodies in the ninth of the month a t even.\" (This is to be understood concerning that time concerning which we have spoken above, because then the Lord is to be sought out.) [VIAMR ALHIM ThDShA HARTz DShA OShA MZRIO ZRO, eigh t words, to which if IHI be added, we have nine. The English version = \"And God said. Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed.\"] 21. (In that passage, Deut. iii. 24, where it is wr itten): \"Adonaï Jehovah, thou hast begun to show un to Thy servant Thy greatness,\" the name, Tetragrammaton, IHVH exis teth perfectly written in its sides. (So that the n ame ADNI, Adonaï, denoteth the inferior H, He, from the one s ide; and the points of the name ALHIM, Elohim, deno te the superior H, He, froni the other side.) [\"In its sides\" -i.e. in its aspects. The points ar e the vowel marks.] 22. But here in this progermination of the earth it is not perfect, because IHI, Yehi (let there be), is not written. (But we read it so that also these letters do not repres ent a perfect name.) 23. (But therein is represented to us) the superior I, Yod (that is, the mark of supernal mercy, which is that most holy Ancient One, as the correct Mantuan Codex shows in a marginal note), and the inferior I, Yod (that is, the mark of inferior mercy, which is Micioprosopus with the inf luence which he hath from Macroprosopus, which two II, Yods, are also represented in that passage, Gen. ii. 7): VIITzR IHVH, Vayeyetsir, Yod, He, Vau, He, and Tetr agrammaton formed (the supernal I, Yod, (and the inferior I, Y od). [The only way that I can possibly see that VIITzR I HVH will bear the construction put upon it here is this (in which an eminent Hebrew scholar, Mr. Mew, agrees with me) : V, Vau, and I, Yod, the Yod, ITzR, Yetzer, be for med (namely, the) IHVH, Tetragrammaton. In this constru ction the first letter Yod in the word VIITzR is ta ken as the object of the verb ITzR, and not as a pronominal pr efix. The most holy Ancient One is the origin of Ke ther in Ain Soph when in the condition of the Ain Soph Aur (see Introduction), while the inferior Yod is the symbo l of Yesod.] 24. (But in) IHI (besides) the superior and inferio r (also existeth) the H, He, between both (like as) a connexion of perfection (whereby the influx is derived from the Macroprosopus and passed on to the Microprosopus.) 25. (Wherefore) it is perfect (since it is this nam e without separation), but it is not turned to ever y side (because therein is no symbol of the bride of Microprosopus) . (Therefore) this narne is taken out from this pla ce and planted in another (that is, those letters also receive ano ther signification from the inferior paths). 26. (For) it is written, Gen. ii. 8: \"And the Tetra grammaton Elohim planted.\" (Whereby is understood) that H, He, which is between the two II, Yods, of the word IHI, Yehi, which in the supernals is) the position of t he nose of the more Ancient One over the Microprosopus (concerning which see further in the \"Idra Rabba,\" § 175)- (Fo r this) existeth not without the spirit. (For this H, He, symbolised in Elohim, is rather th e supernal He alone. than either the inferior He al one, or both conjoined. The nose of Macroprosopus is said in the \"Idra Rabbi\" to be life in every part - i.e., it, the life, existeth not therefore without the influx of the spirit whic h rusheth forth therefrom (See ante, Chapter 1. § 1 5.) 27. Through H, He, therefore, it is perfected (rath er by reason of the mother than by reason of the br ide, of whom it is the soul). For the one H, He, is above (namely, designating the first understanding of the Tetragra mmaton; and the other is) the H, He, below (denoting the queen and the bride). 28. Like as it is written, Jer. Xxxii. 17: AHH ADNI IHVH, Ahah, Adonaï, Yad Be Vau He: \"Ah, Lord Jehov ah,\" &c., where there is a cohesion of the connecting li nks (that is, in the word AH H, Ahah, those two HH, He's, are"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"combined which elsewhere are the media of the conne cting path). For by the spirit is made the connecti on of the balanced equilibria (that is, of the combinations a s well of the father and mother as of the Micropros opus and his bride). 29. (Now the author of the \"Siphra Dtzenioutha\" des cendeth to the inferior paths, leaving out Macropro sopus, and examineth the name IHV, Yod He Vau. In this are rep resented father and mother and Microprosopus. And f irst occurreth) the supernal I, Yod (the symbol of the f ather), which is crowned with the crown of the more Ancient One (that is, whose highest apex denoteth the highest c rown, or Macroprosopus; or, according to another re ading of the passage, \"which is surrounded by the secret things\" -that is by the influence or beard of Macroprosopus , which covereth both the father and the mother). It is tha t membrane of the supernal brain which, on account of its excellency, both shineth and is concealed. (Concern ing this matter further, see the \"Idra Rabba,\" § 58 .) 30. The supernal H, He (then presenteth itself), wh ich is surrounded by the spirit which rusheth forth from the entrances of the galleries (or the nostrils of Macr oprosopus), that it may give life to all things. 31 . The supernal V, Vau, is that tremendous flashi ng flame (which is the beginning of judgment, seein g that doubtless hitherto the Microprosopus existeth in th e mother) which is surrounded by its crown (namely, the mother). 32. And after are the letters taken in extended for m (so that this name is written at length, in this manner: VV, Vau, HH, He, IVD, Yod, which form, when it is perfect, i s usually called BN, Ben, because its numeration is 52), and in Microprosopus are they comprehended (seeing that th en he embraceth his bride). [See Introduction, page 33, Table showing the writi ng of the Tetragrammaton in the four worlds.] 33. When (this form) beginneth, they are discovered in the cranium (namely, these letters, and therein are they distributed in the most supernal part of Macroproso pus). [\"In the cranium\" (or skull), BGVLGLThA, Begelgolth a, or in Golgoltha. In the New Testament it is wort hy of note that Jesus Christ (the Son) is said to be crucified at Golgotha (the skull); while here, in the Qabala h, Microprosopus (the Son), as the Tetragrammaton, is said to be ext ended in the form of a cross, thus- I H H V -in Golgotha (the skull). The text above says, at t he end of section 33. \"of Macroprosopus but I think this is a misprint for \"of Microprosopus.\"] 34. Thence are they extended throughout his whole f orm (from the original benignity), even to the foun dation of all things (namely, as the soul of the inferiors). 35. When it is balanced in the pure equilibrium (th at is, when the white locks of the most holy Ancien t One send down the lights or names) then are those letters eq uilibrated. (That is, from their virtue cometh the light.) [The \"lights or names\" are the ten Sephiroth and th e Divine names associated with them (see Introducti on), which are (with the exception of the first Sephira) compr ehended in the Tetragrammaton IHVH.] 36. When he is manifested in Microprosopus (namely, Macroprosopus), in him are those letters, and by t hem is he named. 37. IVD, Yod, of the Ancient One, is hidden in its origin (that is, the father, who is usually symboli zed by I, Yod, and is himself also called the Ancient One, is shro uded by the beard of Macroprosopus; or otherwise. I nstead of that manner in which the other two letters duplicate the ir literal parts - e.g., HH and VV-I, Yod, by reaso n of his very nature, cannot be expressed by this duplication, bu t remaineth one and alone), because the name is not found; that is, because if II be put, it can no longer be pronounce d as I, Yod; therefore is it written IVD). [The \"Ancient One\" is one of the titles of Macropro sopus, the first Sephim. But the letter I, Yod, of the Tetragrammaton is referred to the second Sephira, C hokmah, which is also called the Father. See Introd uction, § 67.] 38. HA, He, is extended by another (He, as it is wr itten HH in open and plain writing; but also it is sometimes written in another way, HI, also HA; the one in the name OB, Aub, the other in the name MH, Mah), and in the feminine symbol it denoteth the two females (namely , the supernal mother and the inferior mother; the understanding and the kingdom). And it is discovere d through the forms. (That is, when the beard of Macroprosopus, and its forms or parts, send down hi s light into Microprosopus; then herein is his brid e produced in the light, and the supernal H, He, is reflected by another inferior H, He.) [See introduction, wherein a table is given showing the writing of the Tetragrammaton in the four worl ds.] 39. VV, Vau, is extended by another (Vam, as it is written VV, for likewise it is elsewhere written wi th I in the name OB, Aub, and by A in the names OG, Seg, and MH , Mah, in this manner VAV. So also in the name BN, Ben, it is thus written, VV. But to be disclosed it is f ully written). Like as it is written, Cant. vii. 9, \"Going down sweetly to my delight\" (whereby \"sweetly\" are understood th ese two letters VV properly extended)."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"[The Authorised Version renderes it: \"And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved. tha t goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.\"] 40. In that tremendous flashing flame (is he found in Microprosopus, seeing that in a lesser degree he hath in himself unmixed judgments), for the purpose of enshrouding that gate (that is, in order that he inay be advanc ed to the condition of maturity, and may then superumbrate hi s mother, who is symbolised by the fifty gates). [\"He\", that is the letter V, Vau, of the Tetragramm aton. I have before noticed that the fifty gates of the understanding are equivalent to I and H, to and 5, multiplied tog ether, which yield 50 = numerical value of the lett er N, Nun.] 41. (He is therefore called) the supernal V, Vau (D aath or knowledge, and) the inferior V, Vau (that i s, the external Microprosopus. And thus also) the supernal H, He (t he mother), the inferior H, He (the bride). But I, Yod, is above all (symbolizing the father), and with him is none other associated; he is I, Vod, as at first; neithe r ascendeth he in himself (through the height of the numeration, like as with H, He, the pentad, with Vau, the hexad, as cend to a similar height) except as a symbolic glyph. (That i s, the decad, which is expressed not in that same l etter I, Yod, but by a hexad and a tetrad). [But Vau, V, is produced by adding the numerical va lues of I and H (the father and the mother of the Tetragrammatnn), and then taking the least number o f the result. thus: I+H=10+5=15, and by adding the digits of 15 together, 1+5, we obtain 6=V, Vau. By the phrase \"w ith H, He, the pentad (5). with V, Vau, the hexad ( 6), ascend,\" is implied the numerical value of those letters tak en as symbolical sephirotic glyphs. The decad is re peated in the word IVD, Yod, by the addition of the last two lett ers. V and D, which =6+4=10. I, Yod. again.] 42. For when the double forms are manifested (namel y, the letters of the name in the above proposed fo rm, as HH and VV) and are united in one path, in one combinat ion, in order that they may be explained (that is, when they are fully written out in the above manner), then VD, Va u, Daleth (and not another I, Yod), are added unto I, Yod (so that also in it there may be a certain hidden analo gy of the equilibrium). 43. Woe! woe! when this is taken away, and when the other two alone are manifested (that is, when from those two letters VD, in the word IVD, the letter I is taken away; seeing it representeth the abstraction of the fatlier from the Microprosopus and his bride, who are as yet hidden in the mother, so that the disclosure of these two is vain and abortive, because the generative power of the fathe r is absent * *) * *. (Or, in another sense, if the influx be hindered and the supernal paths suffer disruption). Far, far from us be that effect! 44. (But that this may be done by the sins of the i nferiors is clear from these words) Ezek. i. 14: \"A nd the living creatures rush forth and return.\" Also Num. xxiv. 1 1: \"Flee unto thy place.\" Also Obad. i. 4: \"Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I cast thee down.\" 45. (Again it is said) Gen. i. 12: \"And the earth b rought forth germination.\" When? When the name is p lanted therein (that is, when Microprosopus receiveth his proper conformation, according to the requisite num bers - 248 of the members, and 365 of the veins.) [These numbers. 248 and 365, are formed by an elabo rate combination of Gematria, too complicated to en ter upon here.] 46. And then the wind bloweth (that is, the vital i nflux rusheth forth from Macroprosopus) and the spa rk of flame is prepared (that is, Microprosopus, who, great as he is, yet is in respect of the superiors only as a sp ark compared with fire, as he is produced from that terrific light.) 47. And amid the insupportable brilliance of that m ighty light, as it were, the likeness of a head app eareth. That is, the highest crown is found in Macroprosopus.) 48. And above him is the plenteous dew, diverse wit h two-fold colour. (Like as in Macroprosopus it is white alone, so here it is white and red, on account of the judg ments. See \"Idra Rabba,\" § 44.) [Above Microprosopus, not Macroprosopus.] 49. Three hollow places are manifested, wherein the letters are expressed. (These are to be- understoo d as symbolizing his three-fold brain, of wisdom, unders tanding, and knowledge, which here appear more plai nly; whereas in the supernals they are more concealed.) [\"The letters.\" that is, IHV, the first three lette rs of the Tetragrammaton] 50. The black (locks issuing) from the four (sides of the head) float down over the curved openings of the ears, so that he may not hear. [\"So that he may not bear.\" Remember, this is Micro prosopus, or Zauir Anpin, not Macroprosopus, or Ari kh Anpin.] 51. Right and left is here given (in all parts of t he face and head). [\"Right and left:\" that is, Microprosopus is symbol ized by a face in full; while in Macroprosopus \"all is right\"- i.e. is symbolized by a profile.

One slender higher path existeth. (The parting of the hair.)"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"53. His forehead, which shineth not, regulating the far distant future when it is his will to behold t he same. (All the qualities, with their antitheses, which are found i n Macroprosopus, are more fully described in the \"I dra Rabba\" and \"Idra Zuta,\" which see). 54. His eyes are of triple colour (that is, red, bl ack and gold) so that terror may go before them; an d with glittering glory are they glazed. 55. It is written, Isa. xxxiii. 20: \"Thine eyes sha ll behold Jerusalem at peace, even thy habitation.\" 56. Also it is written, Isa. i. 21 \"Righteousness d welled in it.\" 57. The \"peaceful habitation\" is the Ancient One, w ho is hidden and concealed. Wherefore \"thine eyes \" is written OINK, Auinak (without the letter Yod. All these thi ngs are explained in the \"Idra Rabba.\") 58. There is also the nose, to dignify the face of Microprosopus. 59. Through its nostrils three flames rush forth. 60. The profound path existeth in his ears for hear ing both the good and the evil. 61. It is written, Isa. xiii. 8: \"I am the Tetragra mmaton, that is my name, and my glory I give not to another.\" (Now the author of the \"Siphra Dtzenioutha\" beginneth to explain the ulterior difference between Microproso pus and Macroprosopus, even as to their appellations; where the word ANI, Ani, \"I,\" in the above passage refer reth to the Microprosopus, since it involveth the idea of the b ride.) Also it is written, Deut. xxxii. 39: \" I sla y, and 1 make alive.\" Also it is written, Isa. xivi. 4: \"I will b ear, and I will deliver you.\" [In the word ANI, Ani, the idea of the bride (Malku th. the H final of the Tetragrammaton) is implied b y the letter I, Yod, being last, where it symbolizes the ninth Seph ira, Yesod, which is the connecting link between Mi croprosopus and the queen. Also N. the second letter. symbolize s the conjunction of the father and the mother, I a nd H. as I have before observed.] 62. (Now, indeed, Macroprosopus is not so closely k nown by us as to address us in the first person; bu t he is called in the third person, HVA, Hoa, he.) Like as it is s aid, Ps. c. 3: \"He hath made us, and not we ourselv es.\" And again in job xxiii. 13: \"And He existeth in the unity, an d who can turn Him aside?\" [For Macroprosopus is only the commencement of mani fested Deity.] 63. (Therefore in the third person, HVA, Hoa, is He called who is the Concealed One, and is not found of any. He, who cometh not before the eyes of man; He, who is n ot called by the Name. [\"He. who is not called by the Name;\" for, as I hav e frequently before noticed, the first Sephira is n ot comprehended in the Tetragrammaton.] 64. (Hitherto hath the disquisition been concerning Microprosopus, to whom also was referred that fuln ess of form of the letter H, He, wherein it is written by the d uplicated HH. But now another point is taken into c onsideration, namely, concerning the remaining two modes of writi ng that letter, when It is written with A, Aleph, a nd with I, Yod; of which the former is made in the name MH, Ma h, and the latter in the names OB, Aub, and SG, Seg ; which two forms are given conjoined in the name AHIH, Ehe ieh (translated \"I am \" in Exodus). Therefore are t o be considered) HA and HI. (Whilst, therefore, it is wr itten HA, this form can be resolved into HVA, Hoa, he, that pronoun of the third person concerning which mentio n hath been made above: because A, Aleph, in itself containeth V, Vau; to which latter letter the middle line, in the form of the character of the letter Aleph, can be assimilated. And thus, while it is written HA, the word HVA can be s ymbolized; but not vice versa. For although) V in i tself containeth A (because the figure of the letter A ma y be said to be composed of VIV, if its middle line be divided; so that also, without taking the whole character A int o consideration, it may be read HV: this HV) nevert heless doth not contain in itself any real form of writing H, so th at it can he read HV or HI. [The reader must remember that the argument in this section is concerning the shape of the Hebrew lett ers mentioned, alone, and that neither their numerical value nor articulate power is taken into considerat ion. The shape of the Hebrew letters can be seen in the Table of t he Alphabet.] 65. (Moreover, in that same form of writing HA, lik e as A passeth into V, so that HVA, Hoa, may be rea d; so also) A is pronounced Aleph (and this is the second way o f pronouncing the writing HA, which simply is refer red upto MH, Mah. But, moreover, also) Aleph is pronounced a s IVD, Yod (because the form of the letter A is usu ally resolved into these three letters, so that Yod may be above, Vau in the middle, and Daleth below. So t hat same written form HA in itself comprehendeth also that s ublimer triune idea. But not vice versa, from HI is HA to be understood, for I, Yod, is not pronounced Aleph; bu t IVD is pronounced as I, Yod, which is concealed w ith all concealments, and to which VD are not joined (like as that form is to be found in the shape of the let ter Aleph.) [H, He. in Hebrew is the definite article; so that H-A may be read He-Aleph, the Aleph.] 66. (But this form, which in itself includeth V, Va u, and D, Daleth, is usual in the inferior paths, a nd also in the father. And) Woe! when I, Yod, irradiateth not the letters V, Yau, and D, Daleth; (and much more) when I, Yod, is taken away from V, Vau, D, Daleth, through the sins of the world; (because then) the nakedness of them all is discovered."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"67. Therefore it is written, Lev. xviii. 7. \"The na kedness of thy father thou shalt not uncover.\" (For VD, Vau Daleth are the same as H, He; and when it is written IVD, it is the same as if it were called IH (namely if V , Vau, be inserted in D, Dakth). Woe! when Yod is taken away from He (that is, wisdom from understanding, which is the conceiving mother) because it is written, Lev. xvii i. 7. \"And the nakedness of thy mother thou shalt n ot uncover; she is thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .\" Revere her; she is thy mother; because it is wri tten, Prov. ii. 3: \"Because thou shalt call understanding thy mother.\" (This is arrived at by reading the word AM in this passage with the pointing Tsere, instead of with the usual Ckire q pointing.) [\"VD=H.\" This is again referring to the shape of th e letter in question.] [I have already stated in the Introduction. for the benefit of those of my readers who are not Hebrew or Chaldee scholars. that the Hebrew alphabet is chiefly conso nantal, the vowels being supplied by small points o r marks placed close to the letters.] CHAPTER III. 1. Nine are said to be the conformations of the bea rd (of Microprosopus). For that which remaineth con cealed (that is, the other four forms, which meanwhile are not f ound in Microprosopus), and which is not manifested , is supernal and venerable (that is, properly and of itself doth not refer to Microprosopus, but nevertheless desce ndeth upon him in another manner). [It must be remembered that the beard of Macroproso pus had thirteen divisions, therefore the other fou r forms are the difference between the nine of Microprosopus an d the thirteen of Macroprosopus.] 2. Thus, therefore, is this most excellent beard ar ranged. The hairs overhang the hairs from before th e opening of the ears, even unto the beginning of the mouth. [This is the first conformation.] 3. From the one beginning even unto the other begin ning (of the mouth. This is the second conformation -namely, the beard on the upper lip). 4. Beneath the two nostrils existeth a path filled with hairs, so that it appeareth not. (This is the third conformation.) 5. The cheeks extend on one side and on the other. (This is the fourth conformation.) 6. In them appear apples red as roses. (This is the fifth conformation.) 7. In one tress hang down those hairs strong and bl ack, even unto the breast. (This is the sixth confo rmation.) 8. Red are the lips as roses, and bare. This is the seventh conformation.) 9. Short hairs descend through the place of the thr oat and cover the position of the neck. (This is th e eighth conformation.) 10. Long and short descend alike. (This is the nint h conformation.) 11. Whosoever is found among them, is found strong and robust. (That is, he who directeth his meditati ons herein.) 12. It is written, Ps. cxviii 4: \"I called upon Yah , IH, in distress.\" (In this place) David commemora teth (these) nine (conformations) even unto (those words) \"all nation s compassed me about,\" in order that they (the nine above mentioned) might surround and protect him. 13. (It is written, Gen. i. 12): \"And the earth bro ught forth germination, the herb yielding seed afte r its kind; and the tree bearing fruit, whose seed is therein, accordin g to its kind.\" 14. Those nine (paths of Microprosopus) are evolved from the perfect name (that is, from the understan ding or mother, in whom they were conceived; for unto her p ertaineth the name IHVH, which is Tetragrammaton ex pressed and Elohim hidden, which form the nine in power). A nd thence are they planted into the perfect name, l ike as it is written, Gen. ii. 8: \"And IHVH ALHIM planted \" (tha t is, these nine letters of the perfect masculine a nd feminine name, so that they may be a garden-that is, Micropr osopus in action). [By the expression \"Tetragrammaton expressed and El ohim hidden,\" is meant that the former is written w ith the vowel points of the latter. They \"form nine in powe r,\" because the four letters IHVH together with the five letters ALHIM make nine.] 15. The conformations of the beard (of Microprosopu s) are found to be thirteen when that which is supe rior becometh inferior. (That is, whensoever the beard o f Macroprosopus sendetb down its light. But in the inferior (that is, Microprosopus taken by himself), they are behel d in nine (parts of that form). 16. The twenty-two letters are figured forth in the ir colour; not only when the law is given forth in black fire upon white fire, but also in ordinary writings, because this beard is black. [The number of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet i s twenty-two. \"Black fire \" and \"white fire\" are th e colours of the beards of Microprosopus and of Macroprosopus respec tively.] 17. Concerning this (beard, that is understood whic h is said) concerning him who in his sleep beholdet h the beard. \"When any one dreameth that he taketh the upper bea rd of a man in his hand, he hath peace with his Lor d, and his enemies are subject unto him.\" [By the \"upper beard\" is meant the moustache.]"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"18. Much more (if he seeketh to touch) the supernal beard. For the inferior light, taking its rise fro m the supernal light which existeth within the benignity (thus the beard of Macroprosopus is entitled), is called in Microprosopus the benignity in a more simple manner; but when it hath its action within the light, and it shinath; t hen is it called abounding in benignity. (Others read this passage t hus: - He who dreameth that he toucheth the moustac he of a man with his hand, he may be sure that he hath peace wi th his Lord, and that his enemies are subject unto him. If that happeneth because he beholdeth in sleep such a thin g as this only, much more shall it occur if he be f ound sufficiently worthy to behold what the supernal bea rd may be. For this, seeing that it is the superior , and is called the benignity, irradiateth the inferior. But in Micropr osopus, &c.) 19. It is written, Gen. i. 20: \"Let the waters brin g forth the reptile of a living Soul\" (Ch-IH, Ch-ia h, living creature is to be here noted). [To this section belongs the annotation which is pl aced at the end of this chapter; which see.] 20. Like as it is said IH, Yah (CH-IH, Ch-iah, the corrected Mantuan Codex hath it, so that it may exp lain the word ChIH, Chiah, living creature, out of the eighth pat h of the understanding, which is that water of the name Yah, which denoteth father and mother. For when) the lig ht of the former is extended unto the latter (which is the moving of the water) all things reproduce their kind at on e and the same time - the waters of good and the wa ters of evil. (That is, there is reproduction as well in divinity and sanctity as among terrestrial living creatures and man; for by the reptile form souls are symbolized.) 21. (For) while it saith: IShRTzV, Yeshratzu, \"Let them bring forth abundantly,\" they have vital motio n; and the one form is at once included in the other form; the liv ing superior, the living inferior; the living good, the living evil. 22. (So also it is written, Gen. i. 26) And Elohim said, Let us make man.\" (Where) it is not written H ADM, Ha- Adam, \"this man \"; but Adam, man, simply, in antith esis of the Higher One who hath been made in the pe rfect name. [Regarding the \"form of the heavenly man,\" see Intr oduction, § 55.] 23. When that one was perfected, this one also was perfected; but perfected as male and female, for th e perfecting of all things. 24. (When therefore it is said) IHVH, Yod, He, Vau, He (then is expressed), the nature of the male. (W hen) ALHIM, Elohim (is joined therewith, there is expressed), t he nature of the female (who is called the kingdom) . [\"The female who is called the kingdom,\" i.e., Malk uth, the tenth Sephira.] 25. (Therefore) was the male extended, and formed w ith his members (in order that he might have), as i t were, regenerative power. [The \"members of the male\" are the six Sephiroth wh ich together form Microprosopus.] 26. By means of this regenerative power those kings , who had been destroyed, were herein restored, and obtained stability. (For when the lights were sent down thro ugh narrow channels in less abundance, the inferior intelligences could take possession of them.) [The \"kings who had been destroyed\" are the \"Edomit e kings.\" the \"worlds of unbalanced force,\" who cou ld not subsist because the \"form of the heavenly man\" was not as yet. See Introduction, § 41-56.] 27. The rigours (of judgments, which are symbolized by those kings), which are masculine, are vehement in the beginning; but in the end they are slackened. In th e female the contrary rule obtaineth. 28. (We have an example of this in this form of the name) VIH (where the male hath two letters, and th e female one only; and the masculine also the letter in the begi nning long, and afterwards short. But also in this form) the channels of connection are shrouded beneath His cov ering (that his, the supernal letters are doubtless connected in marital conjunction, but they are enshrouded in the letter Vau. And) Yod (is in this place) small, (a symbol of the foundation; because) in the very form (of the femal e, that is, even as he is hidden within H, He, whic h also is not ttie supernal but the inferior H, He) he is found. (And all are judgments, because the supernal influx is w anting.) 29. But if (these) judgments are to be mitigated, n ecessarily the Ancient One is required (that is, th e first letters of the Tetragrammaton, denoting, IH Yah, the father to gether with the crown, which is the apex of the pri mal letter, and is called Macroprosopus.) 30. The same species of rigours and judgments occur red in the inferiors. For like as to the He of the bride, are added the two letters Yod and Vau. under the idea of the leviathan; (so) the serpent came upon the woman, an d formed in her a nucleus of impurity, in order that he might m ake the habitation evil. 31. Like as it is written., Gen. iv. 1: \"And she co nceived and brought forth ATH QIN, Ath Qain, Cain, (that is) the nucleus QINA, Qaina, of the abode of evil spirits, and turbulence, and evil occurrences.\" (See further in the \"Treatise of the Revolutions of the Soul.\") [The \"Treatise of the Revolutions of the Soul\" is n ot published in this volume] 32. (But this name VIH) is restored (if it be writt en IHV; and thus) in that man (the supernal, concer ning whom it hath been spoken above; and also) in those two (nam ely, the father and the mother, also in the androgy nous"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Microprosopus; and also partly) in genus (seeing th at Vau alone symbolizeth both the Microprosopus and his bride) and in species (seeing that Yod and He are placed s eparately as father and mother). 33. (But just as much) are they contained in the sp ecial (representation of those spouses, as) also in the general (that is, as much in father and mother as in Microprosopu s with his bride); legs and arms right and left (th at is, the remaining riumerations, collected together in two l ateral lines, With the middle line representing Vau and Yod.) 34. (But) this (that is, the supreme equality) is d ivided in its sides, because Yod and He are placed expressly as the father and the mother; but in another equality) the male is conformed with the female (like an audrogy n, because the last He is not added. Whence are made) IHV. 35. I, Yod, is male (namely, the father); H, He, is female (namely, the mother); V, Vau (however, is a ndrogynous, like as) it is written, Gen. V. 2: \" Male and femal e created lie them, and blessed them, and called th eir name Adam.\" 36. (Thus also) the form and person of a man was se ated upon the throne; and it ig written, Ezek. i. 2 6: \" And upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above it.\" [This piece alludes to the Tetragrammaton itself, s howing the hieroglyphic form of a man: the I=head, H=arms, V=body, and H =legs. See Introduction and Table of Alphabet.] ANNOTATION. (Belonging to § 19, foregoing.) 1. Another explanation. \"Let waters bring forth abu ndantly.\" In this place, in the Chaldee paraphrase, it is said IRChShVN, which hath a general meaning of movement. As if it should be said: \"When his lips by moving themselves and murmuring, produced the words, like a prayer from a righteous heart and pure mind, the water produced the living soul.\" (The meaning is concerni ng the act of generating life.) 2. And when a man wishes to utter his prayers right ly before the Lord, and his lips move themselves in this manner, (his invocations) rising upward from him, for the p urpose of magnifying the majesty of his Lord unto t he place of abundance of the water where the depth of that foun tain riseth and floweth forth (that is, understandi ng emanating from wisdom); then (that fountain floweth forth ple ntifully, and) spreadeth abroad so as to send down the influx from the Highest, downwards from that place of abun dance of water, into the paths singly and conjointl y, even unto the last path; in order that her bjuntiful grace ma y be derived into all from the highest downwards. [H, He, the supernal mother.] 3. Then indeed is such a man held to intertwine the connecting links of (them) all, namely, those conn ecting links of true and righteous meditation; and all his petition s shall come to pass, whether his petition be made in a place of worship, whether in private prayer. [\"Such a man\" -i.e. a righteous man, when praying s incerely. \"Links of them\" -i.e., the paths.] 4. But the petition. which a man wisheth to make un to his Lord can ordinarily be propounded in nine wa ys. 5. Either (1) by the alphabet, or (2) by commemorat ing the attributes of the most holy and blessed God , merciful and gracious, &c. (according to the passage in Exodus x xxiv. 6, &c.); or (3) by the venerable names of the most holy and blessed God; such are these \\: AHIH, Eheieh (in res pect of the Crown), and IH, Yah (in respect of the Wisdom); IHV, Yod He Vau (in respect of the Understanding); AL, El (in respect of the Majesty); ALHIM, Elohim ( in respect of the Severity); IHVH,) Yod He Vau He (in respect of the Beauty); TzBAVTh, Tzabaoth (in respect of th e Victory and the Glory); ShDI, Shaddai (in respect of the Fo undation); and ADNI, Adonaï (in respect of the King dom). Or (4) by the ten Sephiroth or numerations, which are: MLKVTH, Malkuth, the Kingdom; ISVD, Yesod, the Foundation; HVD, Hod, the Glory; NTzCh, Netzach, th e Victory; ThPARTh, Tipereth, the Beauty; GBVRH, Geburah, the Severity; ChSID, Chesed, the Benignity ; BINH, Binah, the Understanding; ChKMH, Chokhmah, the Wisdom; and KTHR, Kether, the Crown. Or (5) by the commemoration of just men, such as are patriarchs, prophets, and kings. Or (6) by those canticles and psalms whe rein is the true Qabalah. And (7), above all these, if any one should know how to declare the conformations of his Lord, according as it is honourable to do. Or (8) if he may know how to ascend from that which is below to that which is above. Or (9) those who know also how to derive the influx from the highest downward.

Hereto also pertaineth the meditation of the wor d Amen AMN! which in itself containeth the two name s IHVH, ADNI, Yod He Vau He Adonaï (the numeration of the f ormer alone, and of these two together yielding the same, 91); of which the one concealeth its goodness and b enediction in that treasury which is called HIKL, H a-yekal, the palace. (Which word by equality of numeration is th e same as ADNI, Adonaï; but this name is said to be the palace of Tetragrammaton, because, in the first place it i s pronounced by its aid; also, in the second place, it is mingled with it alternately, letter by letter, in this way - IAH DVNHI. [A+M+N= 1+40+5O=91. I+H+V+H+A+D+N+I=10+5+6+5+1+4+50 +10=91. Again: H+I+K+L=5+10+20+30=65. A+D+N+I=1+4+50+10=65. The Jews, when they come to t he word IHVH in reading the Scriptures, either do n ot pronounce it at all and make a slight pause, or els e substitute for it the word Adonaï, ADNI.] 7. And this is pointed out in that saying, Hab. ii. 20: But the Lord is in His holy temple; let all th e earth keep silence before Him.\" (HIKL, Ha-yekal, \"the temple, or palac e; \" HS, Hes, \"keep silence; \" and ADNI, Adonaï, \" Lord; \" all have the same numeration-namely, 65.) [H+S=5+6o=65.] 8. For which reason our wise men of pious memory ha ve said mystically, that every good thing of a man is in his house; according to that which is written, Num. xi. , 7: \"He is faithful in all Mine house.\" Which is t he same as if it were said \"in all which is with Me.\" 9. But if any man attentively meditateth on the nin e divisions of these forms (see § 5 ante), like as it is meet to do; that man is one who honoureth the Name of his Lord, even the Holy Name. And hereunto belongeth that wh ich is written, 2 Sam. ii. 30: \"Since those who honour Me will I honour; and they that despise Me shall be li ghtly esteemed.\" I will honour him in this world, that I may preserve him, and provide him with all things o f which he hath need, in order that all nations of the earth m ay see that the Name of the Lord is called upon by him; and that they inay fear him. And in the world to come he sha ll be found worthy to stand in the tabernacle of th e righteous. 10. Wherefore such an one seeketh nothing of which he hath need, because he is kept under the special providence of his Lord, and can meditate concerning Him, as it is right to do. 11. But what is to he understood by that passageAnd they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed?\" S uch an one is that man who can neither institute the union of the Holy Name, nor bind together the links of truth, n or derive the supernals into the position required, nor honour th e Name of his Lord. Better were it for that man had he never been created, and much more for that man who doth not at tentively meditate when he saith Amen! 12. For which reason, concerning that man especiall y who moveth his lips (in prayer), with a pure hear t (meditating) on those purifying waters, in that passage expressl y and clearly written, Gen. i. 26: \"And the Elohirn said, Let us make man.\" As if it were said concerning such a man who knew how to unite image and likeness, as it is right: \"And they shall have dominion over the fish of the sea, &c. \" Hereunto is the annotation. CHAPTER IV. 1. THE Ancient One is hidden and concealed; the Mic roprosopus is manifested, and is not manifested. [The \"Ancient One \" is Kether, Eheieh, Macroprosopu s, the Vast Countenance. See Introduction, §. 42, 7 7.] 2. When he is manifested, he is symbolized by the l etters (in the ordinary form in which the Tetragram maton is written). 3. When he is concealed, he is hidden by the letter s which are not disposed according (to the proper o rder) of the letters, or (according to another reading of this p assage) in their proper place; because also in him their superiors and inferiors are not rightly disposed (because of the disturbed transpositions). 4. In Gen. i. 24 it is written The earth brought fo rth the living creature after its kind, cattle and reptile,\" &c. Hereunto belongeth that which is written, Ps. xxxv. 70 Lord, thou shalt preserve both man and beast.\" 5. The one is contained under the general meaning o f the other, and also the beast under the general i dea of the man (on account of the mystery of the revolution of the soul). 6. (And hereunto pertaineth that passage) Levit. i. 2: \"When a man shall bring from among you an offer ing unto the Lord, &c. Ye shall ofter, &c.\" Because animals are included under the generic term man. 7. When the inferior man descendeth (into this worl d), like unto the supernal form (in himself), there are found two spirits. (So that) man is formed from two sides-fro m the right and from the left. 8. With respect unto the right side he had NShMThA QDIShA, Neschamotha Qadisha, the holy intelligences ; with respect unto the left side, NPSh ChIH, Nephesh Chia h, the animal soul. [These answer to the right and left pillars of the Sephiroth. See Introduction.] 9. Man sinned and was expanded on the left side; an d then they who are formless were expanded also. (T hat is those spirits of matter, who received dominion in the inf erior paths of the soul of Adam, whence arose base concupiscence.) When (therefore) both were at once joined together (namely by base concupiscence, toge ther with"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"connexion, and the animal soul) generations took pl ace, like as from some animal which generateth many lives in one connexion. 10. (There are given) twenty-two letters hidden and twenty-two letters manifested (which are the symbo ls of those sublime forms). 11. (The one) Yod is concealed, the other is manife sted. (The one is the understanding or mother, the other is the kingdom or queen; so that at the same time it looke th back to the superior paths.). But that which is hidden and that which is manifest are balanced in the equilibrium o f forms. (That is, masculine and femini.ne; the one , the father and the mother; the other, the foundation and the queen ; meaning principally the female idea, which includ eth form and receptacle.) 12. Out of Yod are produced male and female (if, na mely, it be fully written as IVD, Yod, they are the n its augment), Vau and Daleth. In this position Vau is m ale, and Daleth is female. And hence arise DV, the two letters which are the duad male and female; and not only th e duad, but also the co-equal duads (of the superio r and inferior conjunctions). 13. Yod by itself is male (the father); He, female (the mother). 14. H, He, at first was D, Daleth; but after it was impregnated by I, Yod (so that thence it might pro duce the form H - namely the I, Yod, placed at the left hand lower part of Dalelh) it brought forth V, Vau. (That is, the mother impregnated by the father produced Microprosopus. B ut in the shape of the letter out of that minute I, Yod, which is hidden within the H, He, V, Vau, is said to be form ed. Or from the upper horizontal line of the letter H, which is one V, Vau, and from the right-hand vertical line, whic h is another V, Vam, and from the inserted I, Yod, is made VIV, the full form of letter Vau.) [This is again referring to the shape of the letter . See Table of the Alphabet for Hebrew form.) 15. Whence it is plain that in the letter H, He, ar e hidden the letters D, Dakth, V, Vau; and in IVD, Yod, is hidden H: whence are formed IHV. Therefore it appeareth that IVD in its own form containeth IHV, whensoever it i s fully written by IVD, which are male and female (namely I , Yod, male, and V, Vau, D, Daleth, in the form, H, He, female); hence is compounded (the son, who is) V, V au, and who overshadoweth his mother. (That is V pl aced after H, so that IHV may form the father, the mother, and Microprosopus.) 16. (Therefore in the letter IVD, Yod, and in the n ame IHI are hidden two males and two females, which is symbolized in that saying, Gen. vi. 2: \"And the son s of the Elohim beheld (the plural in its least for m denoteth two) the daughters of men \" (and this also). This explai neth on this account that which is written, Josh. i i. 1: \"Two men as spies, saying\" (hence is revealed the mystery of th e two men). But how (is it proved that two females are understood) by the words, \"Daughters of men? \" Beca use it is written, 1 Kings iii. 16: \"Then came ther e two women unto the king.\" 17. Of these it is written, ibid. 28: \"Because they saw that the wisdom of Elohim was in him.\" (Here a re involved the two males, in the wisdom, the father; in Solomon, M icroprosopus. Therefore) then came they (even the t wo women, the understanding and the queen) and not before. 18. In the palace of the union of the fountains (th at is, in the world of creation) there were two con nexions by conjunctions among the supernals; these descended f rom above, and occupied the earth; but they rejecte d the good part, which in them was the crown of mercy; and wer e crowned with the cluster of grapes. (That is inst ead of benignity, they were surrounded with judgments and rigours. Which also can be explained concerning Microprosopus and his bride, first in the mother, a nd afterwards in the existences below, and in exile with surrounding rigours and severities.) [Referring to the previous symbolical explanation o f Joshua ii, 1.] 19. (Also we find these two equations in that sayin g) Exod. xiv. 15: \"And the Lord said unto Moses (wh o is referred to the mother), Why criest thou unto Me? \" (But als o a cry is referred to the mother, just as a groan is to the beautiful path, and an exclarration to the kingdom. But) ALI, Eli, unto me (note this is the same as, \"and unto I, Yod;\" or the father). \"Speak unto the children of Israel (the sp eech is the queen; Israel is the beautiful path) th at they set forward.\" Wherein note well the word VISOV, Vayesaau, \"that t hey set forward,\" wherein are VI masculine letters; SO feminine letters). [\"But also a cry, &c.\" Meaning the three Sephiroth, Bipsah, Tiphereth, and Malkuth.] 20. From above the power of life flowed down in equ ilibrium, for he entreated the influence of the Ven erable One. [\"The Venerable One -i.e., the first Sephira, proce eding from the AIN SVP AVR, Ain Soph Aur. See Intro duction.] 21. Hereunto also pertaineth that passage, Exod. XV . 26 And if thou shalt do right in His eyes, and sh alt hearken unto His precepts, and shalt keep all His statutes. \" (Where in the last word also two equations are pl aced.) \"Because I am the Lord thy God who healeth thee.\" (Note this , because again here is hidden the mystery of the u nderstanding and the wisdom, of the path of beauty and of the co ngregation of Israel.) CHAPTER V."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"1. (IT is written) Isa. i- 4: \"Woe unto the sinful nation, unto the people heavy with iniquity, unto t he seed of evildoers, &c.\" (Here the author of the \"Siphra Dtz enioutha \" reasoneth concerning the small word HVI, \"woe,\" which also is a form of the name. And this word is alone separated from the following portions of the sentence.) 2. Seven are the paths (if the Tetragrammaton be wr itten in this way partially complete), IVD, HH, V, H, (where the father and mother are written in full, Microprosopu s and his bride are written uncovered. If here the last and first letters be combined, and the penultimate and second , and therefore the paths at either extremity, so t hat they may form the letters) HI and VV (mother and son), then are produced (the three middle letters) HH, D (whic h are the symbols of the queen, heavy with judgments. But if mother and daughter be combined) HVI and HH, (then) is produced forth VV (or Microprosopus)as well as DV ( or the androgyn, who also is a condition of judgmen ts), for occultly Adam is denoted, or the male and female, w ho are that DV concerning whom it is written (in th e place cited above) corrupt children.\" 3. (When it is said) BRAShITH, BRA, Berashith bera, In the beginning created,\" (the supernal paths are under stood. For) BRASHITH, Berashith, is the speech (one of the ten rules of Genesis), but BRA, Bera, is th e speech halved. (But there are here understood) Father and Son, the hidden and the manifest. (And also) 4 The superior Eden is hidden and concealed. (That is, no mention is made of the crown.) The inferior Eden cometh forth so that it may be transferred (towards the in feriors) and manifested (through the voice of its o riginal, which denoteth wisdom.) [\"No mention made of the crown \"-i.e., Kether, the first Sephira, Macroprosopus.] 5. For the name (Tetragrammaton) IHVH, Yod, He, Vau , He, includeth the name IH, Yah, (which is of the father, and the name) ALHIM, Elohim (which here followeth i n the text, and pertaineth unto the mother). 6. ATH, Ath (the fourth word of this text, which in another manner signifieth the name) ADNI, Adonaï, \"Lord \" (namely, the path of the kingdom; also the name) AH IH, Eheieh (that is, the path of the crown, and thu s symbolizeth in itself the two extreme paths; here denoteth) the right and the left (that is, benignity and severit y), which are united in one (equilibrium). [Ath, ATH, means \"the,\" \"the very substance of.\" Qa balistically it signifies \"the beginning and the en d.\" and is like the term \"Alpha and Omega\" used in the Apocalypse. For as Alpha and Omega are respectively the first a nd last letters of the Greek alphabet, so are Aleph and Tau of the Hebrew. The \"two extreme paths\" are the cro wn, Ketber, and the kingdom, Malkuth, the first and tenth Sephi roth, the highest and the lowest, Macroprosopus, an d the queen. If the reader turn to the Introduction, to the Tabl e showing the Sephiroth arranged in three pillars, he will see that Malkuth is, as it were, the antithesis of Kether; a nd hence it is said that \"Malkuth is Kether after a nother manner.\" And this recalls the precept of Hermes in the Smara gdine Tablet: \"That which is below is like that whi ch is above, and that which is above is like that which is below .\" 7. HShMIM, Ha-Shamaim, \"the heavens\" (the fifth wor d of this text, and) VATh, Vaath, \"and the substanc e of \" (the sixth word; they are referred unto the paths of bea uty and victory) like as it is written, 1 Chron. xx ix. 11: \"And the beauty and the victory.\" These paths are joined tog ether in one. [The beauty and the victory \" are Tiphereth and Net zach. the sixth and seventh Sephiroth.] 8. HARTz, Haaretz, \"the earth \" (the seventh word o f this beginning denoteth the queen joined together with the glory and the foundation), like as it is written, P s. viii. 2: \"How magnificent (this is the path of g lory) is Thy name in all the world \" (whereby is symbolized the foundati on); the earth which is the kingdom. Also) Isa. vi. 3: \"The whole earth is full of His glory\" (where these three path s again concur). 9. \"Let there be a firmament in the midst of the wa ters,\" \"to make a distinction between the Holy Plac e and between the Holy of Holies.\" (That is, between Microprosopu s and Macroprosopus.) 10. The Most Ancient One is expanded into Micropros opus (or the Crown into the Beauty), and adhereth ( unto it, so that it may receive increase. If) it be not perfect ly expanded (so that Microprosopus as it were exist eth by himself, but instead is retained in his mother's womb) the m outh speaking great things moveth in that place (th at Microprosopus, so that he may be fully born), and h e is crowned with the lesser crowns under the five divisions of the waters. (That is, Microprosopus receiveth the i nflux of the five benignities, which are called \"cr owns,\" because they descend from the crown, or Macroprosopus; but \"lesser crowns,\" because they take their rise from benignity in the Microprosopic path; and they are called the fiv e divisions of the waters, because the water belong eth unto the benignity, and in this verse, Gen. i. 6, 7, the wor d MIM, Meim, waters, filleth the fifth place). 11. Like as it is written, Num. xix. 17: \"And shall pour upon him living waters in a vessel.\" (But the life looketh towards the mother; and it) is (understood to be th at path which is called) ALHIM CHUM, Elohim Chiim, \"the Elohim of life;\" and the king of the universe (that is, the understanding.

(See Chap. I. § 32.) [In the Hebrew, CHIIM. Chiim. \"iving\"; in our versi on of the Old Testament it is translated \"running w ater.\" Chiim is plural.] 12. Between the waters and the waters. (Since there are the superior) perfect waters, and (those which are in Microprosopus) imperfect waters (or those mingled w ith severities; because in another manner it is sai d) perfect compassion, imperfect compassion. (Now followeth a mystical explanation of Gen. vi- 3.) 13. And the Tetragrammaton hath said: \"My spirit sh all not strive with man for ever, seeing that he al so is in the flesh.\" (In this passage, when it is said:) \"And th e Tetragrammaton hath said,\" (it is to be noted tha t) after that there was formed (the supernal structure), in the last pl ace concerning Microprosopus (this name is understo od). For when it is said, \"He calleth this also by the name,\" the Ancient One speaketh occultly in a hidden manner. [The Ancient One is symbolized by the pronoun He in the sentence. \"He calleth this also by the name.\"] 14. \"My spirit shall not strive with man.\" (Here is understood, not the spirit of Microprosopus, but) that which is from the supernals, because from that spirit which rusheth forth from the two nostrils of the nose of Macroprosopus the influx is sent down unto the inferiors. 15. And because it is written (in the same place) \" And his days shall be a hundred and twenty years,\" I, Yod, is either perfect (whensoever its singular parts exist in the form of decads) or imperfect (when they are in monads or units). When (therefore Yod (is placed by itself) a lone (it is understood to be perfect, because in it self it containeth) a hundred. (But if) two letters (are put, then are understood the ten units) twice reckoned; (hence ar e produced) the hundred and twenty years. [The \"singular parts \" of Yod are the numbers from one to ten, for the number of Yod is ten. But when Yod is taken as its square IxI=10x10=100. But II=IxI+I+l (or the two letters both multiplied and added together)= 10x10+10+10=120. But when Yod = 100, its digits are tens and not units--namely, the numbers 10, 20, 30 . &c.. instead Of 1, 2. 3. &c. 16. Yod is alone whensoever he is manifested in Mic roprosopus (that is when the lights of Macroprosopu s descend into Him, then indeed the paths of the decads are i ncreased, and this decad) is increased into ten tho usands (by the paths joined with the four letters of the Tetragram maton) of years. (But) hence (if it be conceived on ly according unto the power of Macroprosopus, it hath that posit ion) which is written, Ps. cxxxix. 5; \"And tbou sha lt place upon me thine hand: \"KPKH, Khephakha. (Where this word K PKH, if it be written according to the usual custom KPK, Khephakh, yieldeth the number 120. But now by addin g the paragogic H of the female, there is given the number 125, on account of the five severities.) [\"This decad is increased into ten thousand by the paths joined with the four letters of the Tetragram maton \"--i.e. the paths are the Sephiroth = the numbers from one to t en; and they are said to be joined with the four le tters by multiplying the decad to the fourth power, or 10 4 . Hence for 1, the first letter, we have 10x1=10; f or H, the second letter, we have 10x10=100: for V, the third letter, 10x10x10=1,000; and for H, the fourth letter, 10x10x10x10=10,000. In the Shemitic languages. a paragogic letter is on e which is added to a word to give it additional em phasis.] 17. \"There were giants in the earth,\" Gen. vi. 4. ( If this word HIV, Hayu, is considered, which also i s a form of the often varied name, it taketh its rise from the king dom.) This is that which is written, Gen. ii. 10: \" And thence is it divided, and is in four heads.\" (Where is understoo d the end of that emanation which the separated uni verse followeth. Nevertheless) from the place where the b ody is divided, they are called those trees (or, as the Mantuan Codex correcteth the passage: Where the garden is d ivided, and the seven infer;or emanations are under stood; where then it divideth the universe into the inferior wor lds and provideth a habitation for the shells or sp irits of matter). Hence it is written. \"And from hence is it divided. \" [\"The shells\" =elemental spirits. The Qabalah alway s calls the evil elemental spirits of matter \"shell s.\"] 18. They were in the earth in those days, but not i n the following time, until Joshua came. (That is, they are applicable unto the path of the bride, which also i s called the land of Canaan, wherein Joshua found t he giants.

And the sons of the Elohim. are guarded (nor is mention made of a similar case) until Solomor came and joined himself with the daughters of men; like as it is wr itten, Eccles. ii. 8: VThONVGVTh, Ve-Thonogoth \"And the delights of the sons of men,\" &c. Where (in the fem inine gender) he calleth the word ThONVGVTh, Thonog oth, and not (as elsewhere in the masculine gender) ThON VGIM, Thonogim, \"sons of Adam;\" so that it is intim ated in an occult manner that the latter (the sons of the E lohim) are of those other spirits who are not conta ined under the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"supernal wisdom; concerning which it is written, 1 Kings v. 12: \"And the Lord gave wisdom unto Solomon .\" (Concerning these matters, further see the Treatise of the Revolutions).\" [\"The Treatise of the Revolutions \" is not publishe d in this volume.] 20. Also it is written, ibid. iv, 31 \"And He was wi se above every man.\" Because these are not classed with man. 21. (But when it is said) \"And the Tetragrammaton g ave him wisdom,\" then is understood the supernal He . (Because he gave unto him the influx of the wisdom of the qu een.) \"And he was wise before every man,\" because f rom her he received the wisdom here below (through the path to the kingdom). 22. Those (spirits) are powerful who exist from ete rnity. That is, from (eternity or) the supernal wor ld (the understanding, namely, whence are excited severity and rigour). The men of the name (that is) who exer cised themselves in the name. 23. In what name? In the Holy Name, wherein they ex ercised themselves (for the performing of various w onders), and not the holy inferiors. Yet (these) did not exe rcise themselves save in the name (and not in holin ess). 24. It is said openly \"the men of the name,\" and no t \"the men of the Tetragrammaton.\" Not (therefore u sed they the name) with respect unto the mystery of the Arcanum, or in a diminutive form; nor yet with any diminuti on of the (name itself). 25. (And because) the men of the name (are) openly (spoken of, hence) are they shut out from the gener al conception of man. 26. It is written, Ps. xlix. 12: \"Man being in hono ur, abideth not.\" (When it is said) \"man being in h onour \" (the same is as if also it were said, a man such as was Solom on) shall not remain long in the honour of the King without the spirit. (That is, in the influx from the King, Micr oprosopus, to whom, or to the beautiful path, the s pirit belongeth.) 27. Thirteen kings (that is, the twelve metatheses of the Tetragrammaton with its radix, which are the measures of mercies) wage war with seven (with the Edomite king s; because, while the lights of the former flowed d own, these could not maintain themselves, and, besides, they a re the classes of the most rigorous judgments which are opposed to the mercies. For) seven kings are seen in the la nd (Edom), and now after that their vessels are bro ken, they are called shells, who have fallen down among the infer iors. (These) nine vanquished in war (the measures of Microprosopus, concerning which see the \"Idra Rabba \"; through which David conquered his enemies), whic h ascend in the paths of those which pass downward, o n account of His ruling power (that is, which make thirteen, as they are in Macroprosopus and his beard, which is c alled his influence, and freely floweth down), and there is none who can withhold their hand. (For whilst the supern al measures permit the increase in the inferiors, a ll judgments are subdiied.) [Concerning the \"twelve banners of the sacred Name, \" the metatheses of the Tetragrammaton. see introdu ction, § 62; also concerning the Edomite kings. I have befor e remarked that the demons are called Qliphoth, or \"shells,\" by the Qabalists. The thirteen in Microprosopus is com posed of nine manifest and four hidden. 28. Five kings (that is, the five letters MNTzPK, M e, Nun, Tzaddi, Pe, Kath, which are the roots of th e judgments), betake themselves into swift flight before four (th e four letters of the Tetragrammaton which bear wit h them the influx of benignity. They cannot remain (since the judgments and rigours cease and flee). [The letters of the Hebrew alphabet are divided int o three classes, the three mothers as they are call ed, AMSH; the seven duplex letters, BGDKPRTh, so called because t hey are sometimes tenues and sometimes aspirates, a ccording to whether they are written with or without the Dag hesh point; and the twelve simple letters. HVZChTIL NSOTzQ. They are also divided Into the three categories of Chosed, Din, and Rachmim, or mercy, judgment, and m ildness. Now these five letters MNTzPK denote the severest j udgments, and their number = 280 = PR = the name of the angel Sandalphon, SNDLPVN, the angel IOR, or of the wood of the world of Asiah, since the greatest par t of it are sterile trees. 29. Four kings slay four (that is, the four letters of the Tetragrammaton are bound together with the four letters ADNI, Adonaï, which) depend from them like grapes i n a cluster (in the concatenation of these two name s, thus, IAHDVNHI). 30. Among them are set apart (that is, among these paths of the Divine names a selection of holiness i s made from these broken vessels) seven channels (that is, seve n broken vessels, which now are like the shells, an d contain in themselves a great part of the lights and souls); t hey testify testimony (that is, the souls thus sele cted, thence having been born into the universe, testify that they are freed from impurity) and they do not remain in thei r place (and are no longer detained under the shells). 31. The tree which is mitigated (that is, the path of the kingdom or Schechinah, which is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which in itself existeth from the ju dgments, but is mitigated by the bridegroom through the influx of mercies) resideth within (within the shells; becaus e the kingdom hath its dominion over all things, an d its feet descend into death). In its branches (in the inferi or worlds) the birds lodge and build their nests (t he souls and the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"angels have their place).

[See the Introduction for the Sephiroth arranged in the three pillars, or tree of life.] 32. This is the tree which hath two paths (for thus is this passage restored in the corrected Codex) f or the same end (namely, good and evil, because it is the tree of t he knowledge of good and evil). And it hath around it seven columns (that is, the seven palaces), and the four splendours (that is, the four animals) whirl around it (in four wheels) on their four sides (after the fourfold des cription of the chariot of Yechesqiel (Ezekiel). [The seven palaces answer to the 3rd, 4th, 5th. 6th , 7th. Sth, and 9th Sephiroth, operating through th e respective orders of the angels into the spheres of the seven planets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury , and Luna. The four animals, or Chaioth Ha-Qadesch, are the vivifi ed powers of the four letters of the Tetragrammaton operating under the presidency of the first Sephira as the ma inspring of primum mobile of creation. The four whe els are their correlatives under the second Sephira, on their fou r sides-namely, the four elements of the air. fire, water, and earth, which are the abodes of the spirits of the elements , the sylphs, salamanders, undines, and gnomes, und er the presidency of the tenth Sephira. 33. The serpent (which was made from the rod of Mos es -that is, the shelf- NVOH, Nogah, or splendour) which rusheth forth with three hundred and seventy leaps (the thirty-two names together with the five letter s of ALHIM, Elahim, which make 37, multiplied by the decad 370, and the judgments of the bride are denoted, to whi ch that shell directeth his springs, because he is of middle natu re betwixt the holy and the profane). \"He leapeth u pon the mountains, and rusheth swiftly over the hills,\" lik e as it is written (Cant. ii. 9. That is, he leapet h high above the rest of the shells). He holdeth his tail in his mouth be tween his teeth (that is, his extremity, by which h e is linked to the shells, turneth towards his other extremity wherewi th he looketh towards holiness). He is pierced thro ugh on either side (so that he may seek to receive the superior a nd inferior nature). When the chief ariseth (who is Matatron) he is changed into three spirits (that is, he assumeth th e nature of three inferior shells). [\"Nogah \" is also the qabalistical title of the sph ere of the planet Venus. MTTRVN, Metatron, or Methr aton, is the particular intelligence of the first Sephira, and i s called the \"Prince of Faces;\" he is said also to have been the \"ruler of Moses.\" Methraton has the same numeration as ShD I, Shaddai, the Almighty.) 34. (But concerning Metatron) it is written, Gen. V . 22' \"And Enoch walked with the Elohim\" (because o ut of Enoch, Metatron is formed). And it is written, Prov . xxii. 6: \"Enoch hath been made into a boy, accord ing to his path,\" (That is, \"hath been changed into \") the boy (namely, Metatron, who is spoken of under his name NOR, Nour, which meaneth a \"boy\"). [\"Enoch hath been made into a boy,\" &c. This peculi ar rendering of the passage, \" Train up a child in the way,\" &c., arises from reading in the Hebrew text ChNVK, Chaso kh, Enoch, instead of CHNK. Chanekh, \"train up,\" or \"instruct.\") 35. With the Elohim, and not with the Tetragrammato n (because he himself is referred unto the path of the queen, to whom is attributed this name of Rigour). \"And he ex isted not\" (longer) under this name (Enoch), becaus e the Elohim took him in order that he might be called by this name. (For this name is communicable unto the angels, and in the first instance unto this chief among thein, namely, Metatron.) 36. There are three houses of judgment given, which are four (that is, the three letters IHV, referred into the understanding, which yield the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, pointed with the vowel points of th e name Elohim. For) there are four superior houses of judg ment (the four said Tetragrammatic letters) and fou r inferior (which are the four letters ADNI, Adonaï, belonging unto the kingdom). For it is written, Lev. xix. 35 : \"Ye shall not do iniquity in judgment, in dimension, in weight, a nd in measure.\" (Where these four are mystically in timated.) 37. (There is one) rigorous judgment (of severity), another that is not rigorous (that is, of the kingd om). There is one judgment by balance (wherein are the two scales of merit and error), another judgment which is not mad e by balance; (and this is) the gentle judgment (whereby the Israelites are judged. But also there is given ) the judgment which is neither of the one nature nor of the other . (Namely, the beautiful path.) [Of course the \" beautiful path \" is Tiphereth, the sixth Sephira.] 38. (Further on it is written), Gen. vi. 1. \"And it came to pass when man began to multiply upon the f ace of the earth.\" (Where by these words) ADM, Adam, began to multiply (there is understood Daath, or the knowled ge, the soul of the beautiful path, to which Moses is refer red; which sendeth down many lights into the bride, the earth, when the spouse ascendeth thither). This is that wh ich is written (ibid. 3): BShGM, Beshegam, \"in that also, he is flesh\" (which word Beshegam, \"in that also,\" by equ ality of numeration equalleth MShH, Moses) Adam (na mely) the supernal (Daath, or knowledge). And it is writt en: \"Upon the face of the earth\" (which face of the earth is this, that the highest representation of the queen is the understanding, the mother, unto whose gates Moses ascended)."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"39. (Concerning this face, it is written) Exod. xxx iv. 29: if And Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone \" where by the face the mother is understood; by the skin, the queen.) This is that which is said, Gen. iii. 21: \"Tunics of skin \" (because by itself the kingdom is wanting in light). 40. To shine (but when it is said \" the face of Mos es,\" the mother is understood), according to that p assage, 1 Sam. xvi. 13: \"And Samuel took the horn of oil\" (where b y the oil, the wisdom, by the horn, or the splendou r of the oil, the understanding is denoted). For there is no anoi nting except by the horn (that is, every descent of unction is through the mother). Hence it is said, Ps. lxxxix. 18: \"And in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.\" (Also) Ps. cxxxii. 17: \"There shall the horn of David flourish \" (that is, the queen shall receive the influx from the mo ther). This is the tenth of the kings (that is, the path of the kingdo m), and originatbth from jubilee, who is the mother . 41. For it is written, Josh. vi. 5: \"And it shall b e when the horn of jubilee is sounded.\" This is the splendour of the jubilee, and the tenth (path) is crowned by the mot her. 42. (This is) the horn which receiveth the horn and the spirit, that it may restore the spirit of Yod He unto Yod He. (That is, when the spirit is to be given unto Micro prosopus, his mother contributed as much, which is QRN, Qaran, \"the horn,' the brilliancy, as the increase which h e receiveth from the father.) And this is the horn of jubilee. And IVBL, Yobel, \"jubilee,\" is H, He (the first He of t he Tetragrammaton); and He is the spirit rushing fo rth over all (because the mother is the world to come, when in t he resurrection all things will receive the spirit) ; and all things shall return unto their place (like as in the jubil ee, so in the world to come). 43. For it is written, AHH, IHVH, ALHIM, Ahah Tetra grammaton Eloldni! \"Ah Tetragrammaton Elohim!\" When the H, He, appeareth (first), and H, He (in the sec ond place); then is Tetragrammaton called Elohim (l ike as a judge; because in the world to come there will be work for much strength. This is) the full name. And it is w ritten, Isa. ii. 11: \"And Tetragrammaton alone shall be exalted in t hat day.\" When the one He is turned towards the oth er He, and Yod is taken away, then cometh vengeance into the u niverse; and except for that Adam who is called Tetragrammaton, the universe would not exist; but a ll things would be destroyed. Hence it is written: \"And the Tetragrammaton alone,\" &c. 44. Hereunto is the hidden and involved Mystery of the King, that is \"The Book of Concealed Mystery.\" Blessed is he who entereth into and departeth therefrom, and k noweth its paths and ways. "}]
