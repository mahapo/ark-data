[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Sefer Yetzirah (The Book of Formation) Commentary on Sefer Yetzirah This commentary is by Dr. David Blumenthal as given in his \"Understanding Jewish Mysticism\". A more detailed commentary by the late Aryeh Kaplan is available at Amazon and other book shops. Commentary on Chapter 1 1.1 There are three things to note here: (1) The th irty-two wonderful paths of wisdom are the twenty-t wo letters of the Hebrew alphabet plus the first ten numbers of t he decimal system. These ten numbers correspond to each of the Sephirot. (2) The multiplying of names and terms se en here is one of the characteristics of rabbinic H ebrew style. One can also see traces of it in the liturgy and le gal literature. Here, several names of G-d are enum erated. YHVH is the most holy name of G-d. It is usually (incorrect ly) rendered Yehweh or Jehovah in English. (3) The last three terms can be translated in several ways. One must u nderstand \"border\" to mean \"boundless.\" It becomes clear, then, that G-d created the world - i.e. made it bordered, and finite - by use of the Hebrew letters and numb ers. Keep in mind that letters and numbers, in antiquity, are no t just signs or symbols but have real existence out side our minds, in this case, are also holy. 1.2 The Hebrew alphabet has twenty-two letters, and by accepted rules of grammar, seven pairs of the l etters have the same shape, with one member of each pair having a dot in the middle. The dot changes the pronuncia tion of the letter slightly. These are the \"seven doubles.\" Twe lve letters have no dotted pairs, there are called \"simple letters\". That leaves three letters which the author calls th e \"Mothers\". 1.3 The \"covenant of the Only One\" or \"covenant of the Unique One\" appears to be composed of the other two elements. One element is the \"word of the tongue,\" i.e, speech, and the other is the circumcised male organ. The symbolism is two-fold: (1) the covenants of the fle sh and of the spirit are the main tools of creation , the one human, the other divine; and (2) the sex organ and speech are the metaphors for the creative process. 1.4 First, the number ten is precisely set and prop er wisdom evoked. Then, the reader is told \"test\" a nd \"explore\" - that is, to try to combine letters and numbers to \" create\" as G-d did. Such activity was, in fact, kno wn in the Judaism of late antiquity. By it, some rabbis were reported to be able to create small animals and homunculi ( animated clay men; the Golem). In performing these acts, the prac titioner \"sets the Creator in His place,\" i.e., bec omes (in a small way) like him. The other magical mishnayot are 2:4, 5; 4:5,10; and 6:7. 1.5 In this section the basic dimensions and \"borde rs\" of reality are delineated: the physical dimensi on bounded by the six directions of the sphere, the temporal dime nsion bounded by beginning and end, and strange tho ugh it may sound to modern ears - the moral dimension of reali ty, which is as basic as the physical and temporal dimensions. Note that the temporal precedes the moral, and that both precede the physical. 1.6 The images from this section have been taken fr om Ezekiel 1. 1.7 The first image here, \"end ... fixed in their b eginning,\" is easily decipherable: a circle, which is the perfect geometric form, is generated. THe second image - th e flame and the coal - is a richer image: (1) Witho ut the coal, there is no flame (i.e., God is indispensable to th e sephirot). (2) The flame is the coal in another f orm (i.e., the sephirot participate in the divinity of God is some way). (3) The flame fluctuates. And so on. The rea der can extend his literary imagination here. 1.8 The Hebrew word for \"shut your mouth\" is belom pikha, and some commentators connect belom with bel imah, the term used to describe the sefirot. If this is c orrect, one should translate: \"the ten ineffable se firot\" or \"the ten self- contained sefirot.\" (The rendering \"intangible\" der ives from an artificial division of the word belima h into beli and mah, meaning \"withtout any thing.\") Two other point s are worth making here: (1) Note that it is the he art, and not the brain, which is the organ of thinking and consc iousness. This is true in other rabbinic sources to o, when one is told to \"direct one's heart\" i.e., consciousness, t o G-d. (2) The \"covenant\" is the agreement of the i nitiates not to speak openly of the mysteries. It is an oath of sec rect."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"1.9 The enumeration of the sefirot begins. Each con stitutes a realm within which the Creator carries o ut a specific creative activity. The first four follow the text o f Genesis: \"And the spirit of God hovered ...\" (Gen .1:2). \"And God said,\" i.e., He created with with words (Gen 1:3), the \"water\" (Gen. 1:2, 6), and the \"fire,\" which ac cording to the rabbis, was created on the second day (Gen. 1:6-8). 1.10 There are three terms here: \"The Spirit of liv ing Elohim\" (Ruah Elohim Hayyim), \"Spiritual Air\" ( Ruah), and \"Elemental Air\" (Avir). The first term refers to th e creative spirit of God, which is, however, not id entical to God Himself. The third term comes from standard ancient physics. It refers to air, one of the \"Four Elemen ts\" which encircle the Earth (cf. chap. 3 of Sefer Yetzirah). The middle term is complicated. It is intangilble, and offspring of Spirit yet different from it, and parallel to water and fire. The function is clear: it is the realm i n which the holy letters are created. Accordingly, I translate \"Spir itual Air\" to capture its divine yet physical prope rities and to set it in associative sequence with the other sefirot. 1.11 Within this realm, the tohu va-vohu of Genesis 1:2 is created. Note that, all through this sectio n, the Creator's activities are described as \"hewing and engraving\" or, better perhaps, as \"hewing and stamping\" (as on e stamps and image on a coin). The three metaphors may refer to different visual images of the same action or to th ree different type of creative activity. The initiates, presumabl y, knew. 1.12 The Seraphim are fiery angels (Isaiah 6:2). Th e Hayot are the complex holy creatures, and the Oph anim are the wheels with eyes, both in Ezekiel's vision. The rab bis taught that both prophets saw all the heavenly beings. Note that God's \"Dwelling Place\" - i.e., the seven palac es of the seven heavens are made from the three \"sp iritual elements.\" 1.13 Having generated the four realms (Spirit, Spir itual Air, Spiritual Water, and Spiritual Fire), an d having created within these realms the letters, the primal chaotic matter of the universe, and the heavenly messenger s, God now sets boundaries to space. He uses three letters of the T etragrammaton (His Holy Name), which he infuses wit h Spirit. He then \"seals\" - sets limits - to the six dimensions of space. Note that God faces east. Concluding Note: What are the sefirot and what is t heir role in Creation? The sefirot are not stages i n the progressive revelation of the Godhead. Rather they are realms generated by God within which He perform s His various creative acts. He acts within them as an ar tisan, forming and shaping His products. These real ms are real, and they are, at least partially, divine. However t here are still several open questions. The text doe s not indicate where the sephirot come from, or how they proceed f rom one another. We also cannot fully resolve the c onflict of imagery between mishna 5 and 14. What is the relationship of this chapter to Genesis 1? It supplies answers to the following questions: Where did \"chaos\" come from? (It is not co-eternal with God. It was created out of Spiritual Water.) How did God \"talk\"? (He didnt. He created letters from Spiritual Air and us ed them, as an artisan, to build the world.) What h appened before Creation? (God generated realms, the tools, and the boundaries of Creation.) Where do angels come from ? (From Spiritual Fire.) Is this version of Creation more e legant in some way than that of Genesis 1? Note that the initiate, too, can \"create,\" on a sma ller scale. Commentary on Chapter 2 2.1 Neither of the images here is clear. The first seems to indicate that guilt and merit are the basi c moral dimensions of the universe (see chap. 1 of the Sefer Yetzirah) and that it is speech (the tongue) that determines which shall prevail. The second image is even less clear. Some take it as a linguistic reference. Perhaps some bre athing technique is hinted at: breathe out (mem, and trans late \"is silent\"), breathe in (Shin), and hold one' s breath (Aleph, a gottal stop). Perhaps some incantational procedure is meant. 2.3 The sounds of these letters are produced at the points indicated. 2.4 and 2.5 The \"gates\" described here are the gate s to creative activity, and the assumption is that, if one can combine the letters properly, one can reenact the c reative process used by God Himself in the formatio n of the world. To understand this text, one must distinguis h between the \"basic arrangement\" of the letters in \"combinations\" and \"gates\" and the \"basic forms\" by which the arrangement is presented, the \"wall\" and the \"wheel.\" For a fuller explanation of these charts, see The Creator and The Computer The \"combinations\" are formed by combining each let ter with all the other letters in teh alphabet. Thi s yields 462 \"combinations\" (22 letters x 21 other letters). By eliminating all the mirror images (e.g., AB, BA), o ne arrives at the required 231 \"combinations.\" Alternately, one can c ombine each letter of the alphabet only with all th ose letters which follow it. Using the English alphabet, this g enerates the series: AB, AC, AD, ... BC, BD, BE, .. . XY, YZ ... YZ. This is the meaning of the text \"Aleph with all of them, Bet with all of them,\" etc. However, the text also says, \"All of them with Aleph, all of them with Bet,\" etc . So one must construct another set of \"combination s,\" using the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"same principle but beginning at the end of the alph abet. Again, using the English alphabet, this gener ates the series: ZY, ZX, ZW, ... YX, YW, YV ... CB, CA ... BA. This pairing of letters forward and reverse, then, gener ates the \"combinations.\" The \"gates\" are formed by pairing the pairs are the forward and reverse \"combinations.\" This is illust rated in Figure 1, where the upper line represents the reverse \"com binations,\" and the lower line represents the forwa rd \"conbinations.\" So much for the \"basic arrangement\" of the letters. As to the \"basic forms,\" the word \"wall\" suggests a re chart, and Figure 1 illustrates that. The word \" wheel\" suggests a spokelike arrangement, and Figures 2 and 3 show t he forward and reverse combinations displayed in th at form. But what is the key? Which is the magical chart (or magical position of the wheels)? The text hints th at when 'NG and NG' have been brought into some kind of balance , the \"proper\" position has been found. By shifting the \"combinations\" of the \"gates\" eighteen times to the right, one arrives at the \"proper\" point, i.e., th e point where 'NG and NG' appear. This is illustrated in Figures 4, 5 , 6 at the arrows. The \"one term\" referred to here is probably the alp habet. For another interpretation of this magic circle, se e Figure 7, taken from Stenring's translation. I do not know how to read this diagram accurately, despite Stenring's ex planations. 2.6 Here, God begins to make concrete things from c haos. The first thing He makes is columns to suppor t the physical universe. These He makes from \"elemental a ir,\" here called \"Air which is not tangible\" to dif ferentiate it from \"atmospheric air.\" The twenty-two needs of the body are not specified, although whatever they are , they correspond to the twenty-two letters of the alphabe t. Commentary on Chapter 3 3.2 The \"six rings\" are the six directions or borde rs, or the six combinations of YHVH. The sequence in this chapter is as follows: the thr ee Mothers rule over the three Elements. From them, basic physical reality (the Fathers) is generated in three dimensi ons: in the physical universe, in the year (i.e., t he seasons), and in the body. From the Fathers, flows the rest of physi cal reality. The following chart illustrates this ( see Stenring, The Book of Formation, for similar charts): Mothers Aleph Mem Shin Elements Fathers in the universe in the year in the body The author presents this sequence from two points o f view - in mishnayot 5-7 from the point of view of the balances triad, and in mishnayot 8-10 from the point of view of the creative process. Throughout the Sefer Yetzirah, the word for \"body\" is nefesh, which is usually translated as \"soul.\" T he context here and at the end of the book calls for \"body,\" howeve r. 3.4 The repetition here is due to manuscript irregu larities. I have not always included the explicator y word \"[elemental],\" so as to give the reader a feeling f or the text, but it is always intended. Commentary on Chapter 4 4.1 These are all blessings which are generated fro m these letters. 4.2 According to grammatical convention, the first letter of each of these doubles has a dot in it cal led the \"hard dot.\" Hence, the letter is \"hard.\" 4.3 Note that the opposite of peace is evil. One ma nuscript reads \"war,\" but the principle of lecio di fficilior praestat (\"the more difficult reading has precedence\") is op erative on the grounds that no one would change \"wa r\" into \"evil,\" but someone might choose the easy way and e mend \"evil\" into \"war.\" The reading \"evil,\" then, m ust be the more accurate because it is the more difficult to e xplain. Actually, the contrast may derive from Isai ah 45:7. 4.5 Again, the magical testing is referred to."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4.7 Note which are the \"seven stars.\" This is stand ard ancient astronomy, with the Earth at the center of the universe and the various heavens revolving around it. 4.8 The chart for this mishna is as follows: The double letters Bet Gimel Daled Kof Pey Resh Tav the blessing the star the day of Creation the date of the body 4.9 Every seventh year is a Sabbatical year accordi ng to the Bible. Every seventh Sabbatical year is d oubly holy, and the fiftieth year of the cycle is called the Jubile e year. Note that here, as in Mishna 4, the Temple serves as a microcosm. Note, too, that if God prefers the seven th of each sequence, then He prefers the Tav (perha ps the mark of Cain), the blessing of Dominion, the Moon, the S abbath, and the Mouth (which, by the power of speec h, creates). The manuscripts, however, differ on the sequence of the blessings, with many ascribing Gracefulness to Tav. 4.10 The anonymous translator has supplied the foll owing diagram: 2 Stones: AB BA 3 Stones: ABG AGB BAG BGA GAB GBA 4 Stones: ABGD ABDG AGBD AGDB ADBG ADGB BAGD BADG BGAD BGDA BDAG BDGA GABD GADB GBAD GBDA GDAB GDBA DABG DAGB DBAG DBGA DGAB DGBA And so forth ... To get the next figure, multiply the sum by the nex t numeral. For twenty-two letters, the number of pe rmutations is 1,124,000,727,777,607,680,000 (thats one sextillion ...). But accumlating the sums, one can calculate the total number of permuations for the usual alphabetic sequ ence. By varying the alphabetic sequence and then g enerating a new set of permutations, one does pass beyond compr ehensibility. Note, however, that this Jewish creat ive magic does not compel God (as does pagan magic). It has p ower only over matter and, perhaps, angels. Commentary on Chapter 5 5.1 These are the twelve activities that characteri ze man. Again, the manuscripts differ on the sequen ce. 5.2 The image here is of a person who is inside a c ube which, in turn, is inside a sphere. To picture it more easily, disregard the sphere. Facing in any direction, the person imagines a plane which is parallel with his face. He when imagines this plane intersecting with the perpendic ular plane coming at his face-plane from behind, on his right side. Then, from behind, on his left side; then, from beh ind, above; and then from behind below. He is, thus , boxed in front, on two sides, above, and below by these plan es. The lines of intersection are the \"borders\" of the mishna. As the cube grows to infinity, so do the lines of inte rsection. 5.7 The chart for this is as follow: Letter Hey Vav Zayin Chet Tet Yod Lamed Nun Samech Ayin Tzade Kof Constellation  Month  Organ  The diagram in Figure 8 shows the representation as a sunset, with the letter \"AU\" being an Aleph. Not e that the sunset, wall, and battle images, while representing the same creative process, evoke completely differ ents moods as images."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Commentary on Chapter 6 6.1 The original texts here are more obscure than u sual. Stenring (The Book of Formation, p. 27) lists several mishnayot before this one which summarize the prece ding chapters. I have chosen to pick up the narrati ve at the point of greatest concensus. Note that this is the sixth chapter, corresponding to the sixth day of Cr eation. The auther summarizes the book in several ways and adds three new images: (1) the Dragon - a constellation near t he North Star, which swallows the sun and the moon during ec lipses, (2) the Diurnal Sphere - the outermost heav en, which rotates once every twenty-four hours and sets the b asic rhythm of time, and (3) the Heart - the centra l organ of the body, which feels and thinks. Note, too, that nature is a witness, a proof, of th e creative order. 6.2 See above, 1:1. 6.3 The Dragon rules the material world. The Diurna l Sphere rules time. And the Heart rules the body. The three metaphors are not clear. 6.6 These are some of the combinations of God's var ious names. 6.7 The phrase \"at Creation as ...\" is in only some manuscripts, but it does confirm that this is a ma gical text and that the word nefesh used here and throughtout is intend ed to mean \"living bodies.\" Note that there are to covenants - one for progeny and one for creative power - and th at both the tongue and the male organ can serve as images for either covenant. The Sefer Yetzirah has no real end. Rather, there a re all sorts of endings. This indicates that part o f the secret creative power as exercised by God and men was stil l consciously hidden. Conclusion From Understanding Jewish Mysticism. Our study of Ma'aseh Bereshit, \"The Mechanics of Cr eation,\" as represented by the Sefer Yetzirah has s hown us a world which is very strange to modern minds. It is a world founded on intanglible beings. It is a worl d created, and sustained, by animated letters and spiritual \"eleme nts.\" It is a world of strange correlations and of an even stranger cause-effect structure. Yet it definitely has a pow er and beautry of its own. By whom and for whom was the Sefer Yetzirah written ? It was written by highly educated orthodox rabbis for other highly educated orthodox rabbis. It was not intende d for the masses. It is not written in simple style . In fact, after fifteen centuries of commentation, some of its key passages are still not clear. Why was this book wri tten? It was written as an elucidation of some of the problems o f the Genesis Creation story and as instruction in creative magic. The Talmud, that great compendium of rabbinic liter ature, reports many instances of magic as practicie d by the rabbis. One example must suffice: What [magic] is entirely permitted? Such as [the ma gic] performed by R. Hanina and R. 'Oshaia, who spe nd every Sabbath eve in studying the Laws of Creation, by me ans of which they created a third-grown calf, and i t it. (Talmud, Sanhedrin 67a, cited in J. Neusner, There We Sat Do wn {New York and Nashville: Abindon Press, 1972), p . 80.}) The Talmud does not specifiy how or why the \"Laws o f Creation\" worked, but the Sefer Yetzirah does. Cr eative magic \"worked\" for the rabbis because Creation itse lf was, after the formation of the sefirot and the letters, a mechanical - a magical - process. By this I mean that God, too, in Creation acted as an artisan who uses his tools and material and who, therewith, \"creates\" new objects. God used His animated letter s and spiritual elements, and once man had the know ledge and spirituality, he too could use the came tools and t he same elements to create. Rabbinic magic was not a coercing of God into doing the will of man. It was a parallel, though lesser, use of the same Power. And for that reason, magic was \"permitted\" with Rabbinic Judaism only when pra cticed by a rabbi, that is, only when the creative act was done with the same spiritual craftsmanship as the origin al Creative Act. The rabbi, when pious and knowledg able, shared part of God's Power. That was the \"image\" of God in which man had been created. Finally, a stufy of Sefer Yetzirah does yield answe rs to some, but not all, of the unanswered question s of Genesis. First, Sefer Yetzirah clearly states that the \"uncr eated\" elements of the Genesis text all were, in fa ct, generated at their proper time and place in the unfolding of the universe. Thus, the chaos, the abyss, the waters, the spiritual air, the angels, the darkness, etc., all came into being after Creation had begun. Nothing was co-eternal w ith God. Second, Sefer Yetzirah clearly interprets \"image\" o f God in which man was created as the power of \"hew ing and engraving,\" i.e., the power of Creation itself, on a lesser scale to be sure. Third, Sefer Yetzirah in terprets the \"speech\" of God in a very clear way. God did not ta lk to himself, like and absolute monarch who wills and it is"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"done. Rather, He generated substance, from which He formed letters, out of which He combined \"words,\" which became things. God's \"speech\" was not sound but a m odeling of units of clay. He is the great Potter he re, not the King. Fourth, the gap between God, Who is pure spir it, and Creation, which is matter, is here bridged by the various levels of spiritual matter and spiritual beings. We still do not know how the transition from spirit t o matter is accomplished, except that it is done in states. Tha t is an important contribution (right or wrong) to the understanding of what happened at Creation. And last, Sefer Yetzi rah does not tell us anything of why God created th e world. Although it teaches us some of the secrets of how t he universe came to be, Sefer Yetzirah still does n ot tell us why there was a Beginning. Is this a more elegant versi on than Genesis? Is it more spiritual? And, in the end, do we really know? "}]
