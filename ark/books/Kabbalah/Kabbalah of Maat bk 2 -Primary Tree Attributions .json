The lecture was titled “Introduction to the Perfected Tree and Its Implications with Regard to the Æon of Maat.” The original edition of B OOK T WO , released in February 1985, ran thirty-six copies and was distributed in part by Boleskine House (which was identical with Math of the ChRYSTaL HUMM), West Danby, as well as by פ -416* himself. A slightly revised second edition, again in a run of thirty-six copies, was released in April 1985. Both of these editions were 5½” by 8½” homemade chap books containing (1) an introduction (2) “The Organization of the New Tree” (3) a tree of life diagram: “Planets & Signs, primary attributions” (4) “The Sefirot” (= Primary Tree Attributions : P ART O NE ) (5) a tree of life diagram: “The Chakkras and Parts of the Soul” (6) “The Paths” (= Primary Tree Attributions : P ART T WO ) (7) a strident little essay called “Why Forsake the Earth?” Both editions sold for $3.60. The original run had a warm light blue cover; the second edition had a more subdued cool (almost lavender) blue cover. A third edition, which included (3), (4), (5) and (6) only, in an 8½”-by-11” format, was prepared in 1989 for distribution through T HE A RCHIVES at Black Moon Publishing, Cincinnati, Ohio. A fourth version—again omitting (1), (2), and (7), also 8½” by 11”—was done in December of 1994 as part of a larger work which included a selection of פ - 416’s writings pertaining to the Kabbalah of Maat from The Kabbalah of Maat : B OOKS O NE through T HREE , and Collected Articles on the Kabbalah : V OLUMES O NE and T WO . Not included from these collections were the bibliographic essays on Kabbalah study in English.** Eleven (of twelve—the twelfth being the original) photocopies were sent out in black three-ringed binders. The current edition is based primarily on the last (fourth) version, though some comparisons were made with earlier versions. פ -416 had previously edited this version (rewording or crossing out phrases and sentences, re-introducing passages from the parts omitted, etc.); these changes have been followed in this edition. Where material has been omitted, three asterisks (* * *) appear. All remarks in parentheses ( ) are from the original text; remarks in brackets [ ] have been added to the current edition.

Keter /Pluto is all at once the remote overseer of the whole tree (in symbol: the single open eye), the prime source of the tree (“...for its roots were in the heavens...”), and binah (the traditional third sefirah ) in latency. This last point is most important to understanding the new tree and its implications. Keter and binah are in essence the same, save that keter represents a phase which precedes the emanation (or extrication) of hokhmah (the traditional second sefirah , the primordial point, called “beginning”). Keter represents “the upper simple light” which “f illed entire existen ce” with “no empty space whatsoever.” 1 To this sefirah , then, would be attributed that primal sameness in which the Will of Wills arose to cause a sp ace in which creation might exist: a withdrawal of the limitless. This withdrawal is called tzimtzum (contraction). This contraction was “equally balanced around that middle point...circular and in complete balance and sameness all around.” In this contraction there were “empty space, atmosphere [residue], and a vacuum surrounding the exact middle point.” This middle point is hokhmah . To this middle point was extended a line of light from out of the limitless ( keter ). This line is simultaneously the path of [the letter] he ([to which is attributed the sign] Aries) between keter and hokhmah and the path of [the letter] shin ([to which is attributed the element] fire) between hokhmah and binah . It is the he path as the expression of keter ’s extension to hokhmah ; it is the shin path as an expression of the relationship (or spirit, hiah ) between hokhmah and binah . 2 To keter is attributed the sahasrara chakkra , the center of the crown of the head. 3 This is the part of the soul called yehidah . _________________________________________________________________ 1. Quotes in this section are from [the Lurianic text] Etz Hayim (Tree of Life) from Rabbi Levi I. Krakovsky’s translation of Ten Luminous Emanations by Rabbi Yehuda L. Ashlag (Jerusalem: Research Centre of Kabbalah, 1969). 2. The path of vau (attributed to Taurus) joins keter and binah . Most significant in this connection is the use of vau as the conjunctive “and.” 3. Keter means “crown.” "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS The Supernal Circuit: Hokhmah-Binah In descriptions of the pillars of sefirot to the right and the left (in works which have preceded our own), the terms “expansion” and “limitation” have been used; also “for ce” and “form.” In the new tree (and, actually, even in the old tree), these ascriptions do not hold up, especially in the supernal realm, where “force” is held in check by hokhmah ([with the planetary attribution of] Uranus). This “force” is not expanded, or extended, outside of a relationship with binah ([which has the planetary attribution of] Neptune). By itself, this “force” in hokhmah is utterly limited in its singularity and lack of content. It is will, but with no [means of] expression. It triggers desire, but for no particular object. Alone, hokhmah is the image of Uranus: the motive for change, yet, as in myth, castrated; it is by his castration that Uranus bears offspring. However, in this posture hokhmah /Uranus is the emblem of radical independence 4 , while ironically seeming to be the most dependent sefirah —at least in the matter of manifesting [expressing] its influence. Hokhmah is depicted as aba , the father. Binah /Neptune accounts for the directing and extending of force, w ill, and motive. In binah , creation truly begins, for here “force” is granted its expression—its obligatory “form.” The influence of hokhmah is harnessed, controlled, and patterned by a will greater than its own. 5 For this reason, binah is the sefirah of intuition, as opposed to will, for it senses the matters of what, when, and whether. It creates by its understanding of the mechanics of primal form. In this, it is the emblem of radical self-determination, which resides in concert with the radical independence of hokhmah /Uranus. 6 Binah controls, bears, and extends the “offspring” of the supernals, so it is depicted as aima , the mother. Between hokhmah and binah runs the elemental path of fire, given the Hebrew letter shin . This can be likened to passion—a passion such as that which underlies a creative surge. The whole circuit, hokhmah-shin-binah , corresponds to the ajna chakkra , which is parallel to the part of soul hiah . 7 _________________________________________________________________ 4. The nuance of the word “independence” attaches it to ideas such as transcendence and detachment . 5. Recall here the abiding affinity between keter and binah . 6. 416’s linking binah with intuition runs counter to orthodoxy which would have hokhmah as intuition (right brain) and binah as logic (left brain). At this point, פ -416 begins to switch between metaphysics and psychology. 7. All of the horizontal paths on the new tree are elements: in descending order fire, air, water. These correspond to the three mother letters of the Hebrew alphabet: shin, aleph, mem . "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS Da`at To da`at is attributed the planet Mercury. Da`at is the prismatic reflection of the supernal realm. It serves as a fulcrum between the supernals and the six lower sefirot . Hence, it is the sefirah most involved with the integration of the so-called upper and lower . In astrological terms, Mercury is the mental process. 8 Astronomically, Mercury is the smallest and most rapid planet; it is something of an interceptor of transmissions attracted by the sun. In being so small and quick, Mercury, upon receiving such transmissions, translates their activity and momentum, for Mercury is both receptive and transmissive. Da`at , as a fully empowered sefirah , represents the displacement. First, it is built (or cultivated) from the energy which, by our conditioning, is normally sunken into malkut . Second, upon being built this sefirah displaces the abyss, that chaotic and over-mystified region of the old tree which separates tiferet from the supernals. Da`at , in its apparent capacities within each of us, is not a con- sciously functioning given; it must be built, or found. * * * To da`at is attributed the visudha chakkra , the throat center, which is the part of soul neshama . The Archetypical Circuit: Hesed and Din The next pair of sefirot consists of hesed , to which Jupiter is attributed, and din , to which Saturn is attributed. Here the left-right roles of extending and limiting are reversed from those of binah and hokhmah . Jupiter characteristically signifies expansion, opening, and enthusiasm. Saturn signifies restriction, fixing, and obligation. Functionally, hesed /Jupiter and din /Saturn represent the most radical polarization on the tree, yet they are set in a tandem to maintain a singular harmony. They act like a gyroscope, hesed being the spinning weight pulling outward, din being the fixed point. This idea is reiterated in the cross which lies between hesed and din : the aleph-tav cross. Aleph signifies the elemental path of air. Here, aleph can represent a springlike burgeoning potential or a confused wad of disorganized stuff in which all things crowd ambivalently. Countering aleph is tav , or thav , which corresponds variously to the element earth, the planet Saturn, or the manifest universe in its entirety. * * * The hesed-aleph-din circuit corresponds to the anahata chakkra , which is an aspect of the part of soul ruah . This chakkra connects with the thymus, a mysterious lymphoid center known to control growth. Controlled growth, on sundry planes, is the function of this circuit. * * * _________________________________________________________________ 8. “Mental process” here is not meant to be equivalent to conscious mind . "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS Tiferet The middle pillar, which includes keter, da`at, tiferet , and yesod , plus the paths which cross the three elemental crossbars [ beth , thav , and resh ], represents strata of consciousness. There are seven strata, which match the chakkras of the tantric system. Before entering into the discussion of tiferet , to which the sun is attributed, let us establish that, in the past, far too much emphasis has been put on the sun, be this in astrology, “qabalah,” templarism, etc. In this over-emphasis is the doctrinal base for the aggrandizement of the various figures, images, and dynamics associated with tiferet /sun: i.e. the Son (Christ or Horus), the ego or self, or the sun in the natal chart. Martin Seymour-Smith makes a number of statements about the sun in his book, The New Astrologer 9 , which bear repeating here: ...the sun, as w ill be seen, is weak and exhausted of astrological power, and Mercury steals a great deal of its strength. [The sun is] that basic disappointment which everyone carries within them. [The] description of the sun as “the masculine principle”...asserts that what gives life to Earth is purely masculine. This is a grotesque, indeed an evil notion. * * * As it is with Seymour-Smith’s new astrology, so it is with the new tree: Mercury steals a great deal of the sun’s strength. It does so because, in the new tree, Mercury, which corresponds to the sefirah da`at , is given the station and function of fulcrum between the supernal realm and the lower six sefirot . Tiferet is theoretically a synthesis of the six sefirot around it: da`at, hesed, nezah, yesod, hod, and din . In this role, it can either be a reflexive nexus receiving and transmitting cues and stresses of the surrounding sefirot , or it can be a huge knot and clog in the free flow of this complex. Tiferet is the centripetal core of the lower part of the tree. It functions as the resistance needed by consciousness to pattern and retain, to identify or dis -identify. It fulfills this function by sheer gravity—and in this is the snare. Tiferet is that repository of identification, that “creature of habit” called the ego. It is this aspect which is too often mistaken for the will , or determinate part of being. In this error, this center generates self-fulfilling prophecies. On the old tree, tiferet was the dead center. On the new tree, tiferet is below center, balanced against da`at . Tiferet can be thought of as the “rendering” of the tree, and in more than just a psychological way. The center at tiferet is not so much akin to the heart as it is to that nervous mass called the solar plexus. Indeed, the chakkra of tiferet is the manipura , which corresponds to the solar plexus. This center’s natural tendency is to be reactive, defensive—to take things personally. Because of this, it is the area most inclined to clog—to cling to what it knows and has habitualized. _________________________________________________________________ 9 .

The planetary glyphs here are the familiar emblems of that classic opposition: female and male. But the female is at the base of the father’s pillar and the male is at the base of the mother’s pillar. Extension and limitation are mixed and mingled in this pair. Traditionally, both sefirot are thought of as hosts ( tzabaoth ), as reflected in their deific names: nezah - HYHVH TzaBaVTh - צבות היהוה hod - ALHYM TzaBaVTh - צבות אלהים In nezah /Venus, the ideal is given depiction, this being a translation of the activity of binah / Neptune, nezah ’s diagonal counterpart. From this sefirah , the ideal is reflected into consciousness as desire. * * * Hod /Mars is the sefirah of conviction set in motion, or initiative, being a translation of the potential of hokhmah /Uranus, the diagonal counterpart to hod . In this sefirah , energy is focused, which is reflected to the consciousness as ambition or strategy. * * * This pair [ nezah and hod ] is balanced by the path between them: the water path, given the letter mem . Ideally, mem acts as a medium of intuition, which is crystallized or focused by the activities of nezah and hod . “Feel,” rather than will or regimen, is the solution to this opposition. The chakkra of the nezah-mem-hod circuit is the svadistthana , which is connected with the adrenals, which are hormone producers. The inner portion of the adrenals secretes adrenaline, which is the hod /Mars aspect. The outer portion secretes various hormones influencing such functions as sexual characteristics, metabolism, and the retention of salt; this is the nezah /Venus aspect. (It is interesting to note that the adrenals are regulated in part by the pituitary, which corresponds to the ajna chakkra [of the hokhmah-shin-binah circuit].) Nezah-mem-hod , as the svadistthana chakkra , is an aspect of the part of soul ruah . "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS Yesod The final sefirah , and foundation (= yesod ) of the tree has as its planetary attribution the moon. It is, inwardly and outwardly, a hyper-receptive sefirah ; in this, it would seem doomed to being a reactive, emotional catch-all. However, it is spared from this by the force of its inherent cycles, which reflect the integrity of the entire tree—whether tiferet /sun is in co-operation with yesod or not. In this reflection, yesod brings to consciousness a reading of one’s internal tree in a language which often defies words. This sefirah is instinct in its broadest sense. Yesod is both receptive and transmissive, like its higher echo da`at . In much the same way that Mercury intercepts transmissions attracted by the sun, yesod /moon intercepts transmissions attracted by the earth. And even as the sun has been over-emphasized in common dogma, the moon and its influence have been considered too little. Contrary to its reputation, the moon is utterly objective in its reception and transmission. This is because the moon has no tendency to objectify (a tendency which is the sun’s major flaw). Messages of yesod /moon are called sub jective and sub conscious as a means of denying the information with which tiferet /sun (ego) chooses not to cope. The ability to read the messages of yesod /moon, to heed its instinctual and emotional cues, is crucial in the building and sustaining of da`at . The chakkra of yesod is the muladhara , which corresponds to the anal/genital area, the perceived place of the sexual stir. 10 In truth, this perception is a reflection of an inspiration transmitted from the supernal realm. This inspiration is given shape and content by the subjective complex of the six lower sefirot . But much more than having to do with sex, the stirs of the yesod zone instigate a range of relative modes of perception and enactment. Sexual terms are but one of many aspects of these stirs. The tracing of the sexual form coalesced in yesod back to the notions native to hokhmah and binah is a process vital to the integration of the tree. The yesod /moon center is equivalent to the nefesh . _________________________ 10. 416 differs from conventional chakkra /body correspondence. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS Part II: The Paths For the attributions of the planets, signs, and elements on the new tree, there is a simple scheme: 1. the planetary paths are the seven verticals 2. the paths for the signs are the twelve diagonals 3. the elemental paths are the three horizontals There is a logic to this placement which is entirely missing in the old system. 11 Not only does the new arrangement bring sense to the attributions of the astrological items, but the newly conceived formation of the tree itself accommodates Hebrew alphabetical order. 12 Aleph : Air Aleph is the prime mediating path of the tree running between hesed and din . It cuts the tree exactly in half horizontally. Being the prime mediator, this path is burdened with all of the virtues and pathologies of such a role. A skeletonic rendering of the tree shows aleph , air, between shin , fire, and mem , water: In that aspect of aleph which unifies or reconciles shin and mem , it represents all-possible and all- potential. In that aspect which divides and causes stress between shin and mem , aleph represents all chaos and confusion. It is the symbol of un-harnessed mentality, open to the fresh and new but prone to losing control. This split of aspects could be termed “inspiration” and “delusion.” The functional harness upon aleph on the tree is the tav (or thav ) path, which crosses aleph at the exact center of the tree. Aleph is considered the first creation of the universe, having been born between the primal emanations of shin (the father) and mem (the mother). In this, aleph represents a phase of the parzuf (literally “face”; persona) Zeir Anpin (hereafter Z”O), the son in the family of parzufim (faces). While initially Z”O was given the path of aleph as a station, he was ultimately removed to be confined in the sefirah tiferet because he failed to mediate. 13 _________________________________________________________________ 11. Here, “old system” refers specifically to the Golden Dawn arrangement of path attributions. 12. Refer to פ -416’s “Document #2” (D ecember 30th, 1982; in The Kabbalah of Maat : B OOK O NE , 1984) for a description of the formation of the upper half of the tree. “Document #2” is appended below. 13. “Document #2” details the mythological sequence alluded to here."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS Beth : Mercury In that phase of the formation of the tree in which the aleph path was held by Z”O, the beth path was emanated containing nukva , the daughter. In this early phase, the beth path cut the tree in half from top to bottom. 14 In the tree’s final form, the beth path connects keter and da`at . Being mercurial, it is something of an upward extension of da`at , whose planet is also Mercury. The beth path functions as a kind of antenna for da`at set into the supernal realm. Most importantly, beth crosses the shin path, which puts fire (i.e. spirit, hiah ) into the reach of consciousness. The primary function of beth is tikkun (emendation) and this by the dynamic of Mercury. The function of Mercury is dual (biune 15 ) as shown by the two glyphs which compose it: Gimel : The Moon The gimel path runs from hokhmah to hesed . Gimel is receptive to the fundamental w ill ( hokhmah ), the power of which is not released unless aided by binah or, more subjectively, by one of the paths connected to it. Hokhmah has no inherent push: its nature is to be absorptive ( i.e. , in its roll of holding the primal point). Thus, gimel draws (some would say “steals”) will—along with the notion of radical independence—from hokhmah . Through the gimel path, this will and notion are passed to hesed , where they become manifest radiations which influence the lower part of the tree. Mercifully, gimel and hesed , while acting as directors of fire of sorts, are both of a watery nature, tending to manifest more glamour than aggression. Daleth : Venus Daleth runs between binah and din . It crystallizes notions of self-determination born in binah , but in a moderating way. Daleth mediates between the radical extension (determinatrix) of binah and the restrictive recoil of din . In this position, daleth functions to sustain the “ideal,” pacing the empowerment it brings to din . It bears those inklings of a high degree of karmic insight and spiritual practicality. _________________________________________________________________ 14. In the “early phase” referred to, there were but two paths on the tree: the horizontal aleph and the vertical beth . 416 emphasizes the equivalence of nukva and Maat. 15. Details of this quality are given with regard to the signs of the zodiac which are considered “biune” by 416, namely Gemini, Cancer, Libra, Aquarius, and Pisces. See below. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS Heh : Aries ( keter-hokhmah ) That keter holds heh as binah holds shin is “the beginning of wisdom” ( reshith hokhmah ), if the reader will indulge some kabbalistic wordplay. Heh is the initial emanated blast from the infinite 16 , the “light of the line.” This heh path reflects the active expression of the initial H of HYHVH. The he ( ה ) path expels the Y ( י yod ), i.e. , hokhmah , the primal point. Vau : Taurus ( keter-binah ) The vau path expresses the affinity of keter and binah . In this regard, vau is translated literally from the Hebrew as “and.” Hidden in the conjunctive are the signals of the primal adjustment made by the infinite to accommodate the finite. The shape of the Hebrew letter suggests this primal action ( י yod ) in extension ( ו vau ). Yet this extension is corralled by that which creation ( binah ) can endure. Hence, vau is a pacer of the infinite to its alter-expression, binah , rather like the cog in the wheel of primal swirling on the one hand, or the shell of the cosmic egg on the other. Zayin : Gemini This is a complex path expressing a host of fundamental pairs, most importantly keter-binah , but also gimel-daleth . The zayin path connects hokhmah and da`at . It is two-way (biune: Gemini), inhering doubles. It presents a notion of the true will to consciousness. At the same time, it is the path which leads to the indwelling state of radical independence: will with no object. The vessel of messages from zayin is the word. POWERS OF THE BIUNE zayin /Gemini: 17 Inspiration of means. Crystallization in to form of heretofore vague notions. Illusion, in the manifest sense. Details of hidden knowledge. _________________________________________________________________ 16. According to 416, the three primal feminine forces are the infinite, aima (the mother, binah ), and nukva (the daughter). The infinite is associated with the sefirah keter . The affinity of these three is reflected in 416’s revision of the tetragrammaton to HYHVH, the Y -yod developing (or, to nuance it as פ -416 might, devolving ) into V- vau while the Hs remain constant save for their relationships with the Y and the V. 17. These comments concerning BIUNES (and all of the others throughout this piece) were culled from an early stratum of 416’s new tree material “r eceived from MVY.” Comments on the BIUNES occur in an entry from July 25, 1982, entitled “Two, 2, B.” "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS NOTE ON AIRY BIUNES : The airy biunes tend to be mental and technical; they tend toward doing. One side [of the biune] views the other with enthusiasm within the unit complex. Co-operation and advantage are deliberated. An outside influence is needed to direct the general thrust of air activity, or else useless dispersal results. The balance of the shifting acts in self-nullification unless the biune is directed. Heth : Cancer The heth path is a counterpart to the zayin path. Heth /Cancer, too, is biune, bringing to conscious- ness notions concerning modes and motives of the supernal realm. Heth ’s path runs from binah , the abode of radical [self-] determination, to da`at . Messages from the heth path course like the sea in the vessel of the image. POWERS OF THE BIUNE heth /Cancer: Inspiration of co-ordinated impression. Bound imagining. Relaxation of over-specific forms, rendering them modal. The grasp of heretofore vague notions. Nurturing. NOTE ON THE WATERY BIUNES : One side (of the biune) views the other in despair. Often, one side, the more apparently negative or difficult, is suppressed, and its expression emerges uncontrolled. An outside influence is needed to direct it by drawing from both sides. Imbalance results from unacknowledged dualness (“duality”), i.e., one side dominates (drowns) the other. Teth : Leo ( da`at-hesed ) The teth path expresses the expansive and assertive part of da’at’ s release, aptly sent to the expansive, enthusiastic hesed . After a certain manner, teth indicates binah ‘s actions upon hokhmah . In another phase, it indicates nukva ‘s actions upon Z”O. Yod : Virgo ( da`at-din ) The yod path is the counterpart to the teth path, expressing the indrawn and absorptive aspect of da`at , which is shown to din . This path develops notions received from hokhmah : isolation, independence. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS Kaph : Jupiter The kaph path extends the qualities of hesed to nezah . In formula, this path is “expansion toward the ideal,” which could alternatively be rendered “enthusiasm for the ideal desire.” Lamed : Libra Like kaph , the lamed path extends from hesed , but as a moderating path running between the fiery sun of tiferet and the watery Jupiter of hesed. Lamed paces and balances the force of hesed ‘s expansion and enthusiasm as it is brought to the middle pillar. POWERS OF THE BIUNE lamed /Libra: Inspiration of judgment. Sense of completion and grace in form (æsthetics). Evaluation of notions heretofore disordered. (Libra in particular gets loaded by outside influence. Since ambivalence is its tendency, it seeks to supply the opposition to what its outside influence has provided.) Mem : Water Mem is another mediator, here between nezah and hod . It symbolizes the subconscious and the dynamics of the lower part of the tree (which are reflected and coalesced in the sefirah yesod . Mem holds the intuitive reconciliation of nezah-hod (Venus-Mars). Being horizontal, mem functions as a brake on the release of tiferet . The resh /sun path crosses mem , suggesting the process of dispersing (the influence of) the sun. It is by the submission of the sun to water (the unconscious) that its imposing attraction (or gravity) may be overcome. Nun : Scorpio Nun runs between din and tiferet , bearing messages of restriction and adjustment. Nun perpetually signals one kind of death or another. Nun , however, is, in a certain way, modally akin to binah ; in this, nun carries notions of how the supernal realm affects tiferet . The less dispersed ( i.e. integrated) in sun is, the more jarring these messages will be—if they aren’t simply denied altogether. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS Samekh : Sagittarius Samekh connects nezah and tiferet . In the proper functioning of this path (and the sefirot at either end of it), it acts as a personalized locus of integration for one very important aspect of the supernal cross ( shin-beth , שב , or “sheev,” the Hebrew word for VITRIOL ). However, in this path lie snares which can lead to all manner of self-indulgence. Ayin : Capricorn Ayin represents another aspect of the shin-beth cross brought to the personal arena. This aspect is relative to the meaning of the word “ ayin ,” namely EYE , and to the concept of עש ( ayin-shin ), “ shin- indwelling.” If such indwelling occurs in an imbalanced psyche, obsession can result. Ayin connects tiferet and hod ; it is easy to see how, if out of balance, this complex could evoke exaggerations of self-assertion. Pe : Mars Pe ascends from hod with the feeling that it is pulled up by din . This Martian path is radicalized by din (Saturn). Pe is the purifying fire for the psyche; it clarifies a harsh view of the psychic state which invokes karma. This is complemented by pe’ s counterpart, kaph , which is the momentum to move ahead. Tsade : Aquarius Tsade brings the passage of desire and ideal to the emotive center, i.e. nezah to yesod . It reiterates the initial coming into being of the universe. THE POWERS OF THE BIUNE tsade /Aquarius: Inspiration of value, or usefulness. Relaxation of self-orientation (rendering forms and notions accessible to the “populus”). Associative and parallel thinking. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS Qoph : Pisces Qoph is the path of submission. It links the tree’s lower reflection of will directed ( hod ) with the subconscious field ( yesod ). Ironic to its position on the tree, it is a most depersonalized path, being properly perceived as sunless ( i.e. , egoless). THE POWERS OF THE BIUNE qoph /Pisces: Inspiration of depth. Unbound imagining. Hypermodality (manifestation or content unimportant or neglected). The grasp of the secret sense of heretofore vague notions or shallow understanding. Resh : Sun Resh is the extension of tiferet to yesod , the personal center of gravity to the emotive coalescence. It is the sun seeking its own reflection in the moon; however, it doesn’t always like what it sees. Resh crosses mem , bringing to the sun the means to submerge and sacrifice, and thereby save, itself. Shin : Fire ( hokhmah-binah ) Shin is the fire, or vital force, of life spirit, hiah . It is the fundamental force which stirs and sustains consciousness and movement. In the psyche, it is the play between the radicals of independence and determination, which are parallel in a certain manner to free will and fate. Thav : Saturn Thav is the pragmatic scope of possibility clamped between tiferet and da`at . It offsets the raw openness of its cross, aleph . It is the assumed and internalized domain of the personality, and thus stabilizing, but not unchanging. It records developments of the tree as a whole and presents them to the conscious (and subconscious) mind as the image of the universe—down, even, to the smallest detail.

From The Notebooks of Frater פ THE FULL TEXT OF Document #2 Dogma (December 30, 1982) 0. The lamed /Aquarius forms are not only modes of work. The aleph form is the key of creation. 1. First there is not. 2. Within not forms a will, which polarizes not. 3. The will evokes form, and the two are as fire and water. The will is an immobile flame, but the word comes down. 4. The two are mediated by the created word of not, the mediating, yet primal, element of creation: aleph . Fire and water are emanated; they meet to create air. 5. The emanated sought to form. 6. Yet Z”O remained remote and enclosed, concealing the fire from the water. So the great will of wills extended the second letter, beth , to extend the fire while containing it. The extension is nukva , favored of the will of wills. 7. To establish the right and left the will called the right gimel and the left dalet , both in the child’s honor. The gimel to the right evoked gedulah ; the dalet to the left evoked din . 8. The will sought to elevate aima so that the son should not separate her from aba , for if she remained separate, creation would not continue. 9. The will, having set the poles of right and left, established elevated stations for aba and aima through heh and vav . The will sent heh to the right, a female form, so that it might couple with aba . The will sent vav to the left, a male form, so that it might couple with aima . Between them was set the passion of the will: shin . It set aba to rule over gimel and the right. It set aima to rule over dalet and the left.

Aba sent forth the word, zain , to the children. Aima sent forth the image, cheth , to the children. ...and A”A extended beth throughout. But the son, Z”O, could not bear it, for he was receiving all in full power, yet he could not extend, so he shattered. 11. The shattering made sparks and husks. Aba and aima gathered the sparks to create a lamp to contain the powers of the extension and to mediate them and to establish a crown for nukva . Aba and aima gathered the husks to create a vessel for all, to moderate its power. This vessel was extended to the son, Z”O, as a fixed station to compensate his dispersion. 12. Aba and aima withdrew, for they loathed the son ... he had made them fix the end before its time. 13. The universe was imbalanced and unstable; upper was no longer reflected in lower, and the son was weak. This is why the father is remote and the mother is sorrow. 14. Seeing the mother’s sorrow, nukva established the sphere of reflection at the base by sacrificing her crown of glory. 15. The son could not hold right and left in his weakness, so nukva seized shin and sought to hold left and right. She did so for the sake of the mother ... for she and Z”O are crossed. To the right she revealed the fire through herself as teth , the serpent. To the left she concealed the fire through the reflection of her roots as yod . 16. Thus was the upper perfected. The lower was built by nukva alone, beginning with mercy: kaph . "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS COMMENTARY: [The text is given in CAPITAL LETTERS .] 0. T HE LAMED /A QUARIUS FORMS ARE NOT ONLY MODES OF WORK . T HE ALEPH FORM IS THE KEY OF CREATION . The modes of Maat/Nuit – lamed / tzade – Libra/Aquarius determine the current of the æon of Maat, its structures and methods. Expression in this universe is not as rigid as it has been in previous æons, because aleph is the key of creation. (In the Perfected Tree, thav , The Universe, is in the middle, crossed by aleph .) Aleph ’s secret lies in its flux and in its being a medium, or means, of reflection—an expressionless formation of peace between upper and lower. Ultimately, it is the echo of not , and it is this by its surrender or destruction. Tzade is the source. Tzade is not The Star, but the body in which the stars are embedded. This tzade figure is akin to Nuit; in the text she is called nukva . The sky-arch perceived in briah as Nuit is the arch of the foot of nukva , who resides in azilut and directs it passage. Nukva is shown as [ yesod of azilut] which combines with keter of briah as to depict the ideal universe in potential: Nukva is the daughter, equivalent to the final H ( ה ) in HYHVH ( היהוה ) and, in æonic terms, to Maat. 1. F IRST THERE IS NOT . The first event is tzimtzum ( CONTRACTION ), which is described in the kabbalah of Isaac Luria (1534-1572), whose teachings were collected in a book called The Tree of Life by his major pupil, Hayim Vital (1543-1620) [Quoted below is the Work of the Chariot translation of The Tree of Life (second edition, Los Angeles: no date—ca. 1971).] Before first “everything was imbued with infinite light, to which there was no beginning nor yet any end.” "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS First was the creation of not , by withdrawal or counter-emanation, “in such a manner that the space was a completely even circle all around, with no square angular protrusions, since the infinite also contracted itself and became circular.” The circle describes both the not within itself and the infinite outside itself. At this stage, there is no-thing. This 0 idea is echoed in the aleph-thav cross in the middle of the tree, after a certain condensed manner. Recall: 0 = 2. 2. W ITHIN NOT FORMS A WILL , WHICH POLARIZES NOT . Resident in the division between not and infinite is a polarization which, in mode, passes into not as will. This will defines not by aspecting, or polarizing, it. Yet, in this apparent corruption of pure not is its proof and momentum—its evolution by division. In not there are two tendencies: to return to the infinite and to remain not . This stress is the root of will, the potential of the primal circuit. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS 3. T HE WILL EVOKES FORM , AND THE TWO ARE AS FIRE AND WATER . T HE WILL IS AN IMMOBILE FLAME , BUT THE WORD COMES DOWN . Will is traditionally associated with fire. The present scheme refers to fire as the will in motion, or determination . Fire is the manner of spirit in these upper worlds which is generated by the interaction of will and its expression, which are inseparable from one another as well as inseparable from the spirit generated. This is like the kabbalistic idea of the unity of knower, known, and knowing in the deific realm. This concept is found in Pardes Rimmonim by Moses Cordovero (1522-1570). In Cordovero’s discussion, knowledge-knower-known refers to keter-hokhmah-binah , which would be equivalent to A”A -aba-aima in the text. (These figures are detailed in the comment to § 5 below.) The words will and impression are also akin to force and form as these words are used by some contemporary kabbalists to describe the dynamics of the right and left pillars of the tree. Azilut and briah are in the same relationship as will and impression . The spirit created between fire and water (as will and impression ) is aleph or ruah . Between fire, so-called, and water (as hokhmah and binah ) the spirit generated is shin , hiah . "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS 4. T HE TWO ARE MEDIATED BY THE CREATED WORD OF NOT , THE MEDIATING , YET PRIMAL , ELEMENT OF CREATION : ALEPH . F IRE AND WATER ARE EMANATED ; THEY MEET TO CREATE AIR . This mediate configuration is called Lamed Mode; the shape of the letter suggests the configuration. Aleph is the ox, and lamed is the goad—or mode —which drives it in this creation. Shin , fire, is that which constitutes the nature if the primal will, but only in relation to the impression, mem , water. For the will to exist, it must be expressed by its impression. The impression is constituted from the medium out of which the will arose, the infinite, for, at this stage, there is no other. The will alone is not , the zero or first division. The impression is likened to and in affinity with the infinite. (The affinity between keter and binah will be discussed more fully later. However, in the present context, the infinite, attributable to keter , and the impression, attributable to binah , are essentially the same, save that the infinite is solely in relation to itself, whereas the impression is in relation to the will.) Mem in the configuration here represents “the submergence (like sacrifice ) of the higher in the lower (position) in order to sublimate the lower” (Israel Regardie, The Golden Dawn , volume 4, page 213: description of T HE H ANGED M AN card.) Where fire and water meet, aleph /air is created— created , not emanated , for aleph is of a second order, or phase, which is briatic (creation), not azilutic (emanation). The evolution of briah is, however, matched by developments in azilut . In the present context, the activities of the parzufim ( FACES – see § 5) are azilutic while the results, or impressions, of these activities are briatic . This being the case, the separation of these two world does not truly exist."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS 5. T HE EMANATED SOUGHT TO FORM .  Aspects of emanation sought relative expressions. The aspects are called the parzufim , FACES , of which there are five. 0.  arik anpin A”A infinite tzade ( צ ) keter 1. aba father shin ( ש ) hokhmah 2. aima mother mem ( ם ) binah 3. zeir anpin Z”O son aleph ( א )  4.  nukva  daughter beth ( ב ) The doctrine of the parzufim was introduced in the Zohar and developed in Lurianic kabbalah. (Refer to Zohar §§ Sifre di Tzeniutha , Idra Rabba , and Idra Zutta .) In this mythological symbolism, azilut becomes populated. The aspects, or isolated dynamics, of the developments to this point are given anthropomorphic ascriptions to clarify their interactions. Lo, these attributions conceal as much as they reveal. From this point on, the scheme diverges from that of the patriarchs, for it describes the æon of Maat and how it comes to be. This creation shall displace the old. In the new scheme, A”A is not given a male identity as it is in the old kabbalah. One would ideally expect that this figure be genderless or hermaphroditic. However, all indications are that it is female. The dogmatic key is in the initials A”A. When unmanifest as the infinite, it is expressed as 1 / 1 . Contracted, it is 1 – 1, (0). "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS Reflected in primal manifestation it is 1 + 0 + 1, namely 2, which is one place aima and in another place beth. The implications of these formulæ incline toward a parthenogenetic ideal, which is the logical anthropomorphic solution to the formula 0 = 2. As the parzufim become defined, or condensed, they interact as components in a manner similar to the sefirot. 6. Y ET Z”O REMAINED REMOTE AND ENCLOSED , CONCEALING THE FIRE FROM THE WATER . S O THE GREAT WILL OF WILLS EXTENDED THE SECOND LETTER , BETH , TO EXTEND THE FIRE WHILE CONTAINING IT . T HE EXTENSION IS NUKVA , FAVORED OF THE WILL OF WILLS . The universe being created here is that of the æon of Maat. The Maat equivalent in the text is beth or nukva . In this scheme, the general dynamic of Horus, aleph , or Z”O is disintegrated; its nature, relative to that of Maat, is shown. Note that the will of wills is not the will. The will of wills is A”A; the will is aba . Inevitably, though, aba ’s will has its source in A”A. When Z”O condensed as a parzuf ( FACE ), rather than mediating or reflecting the interaction of aba and aima , he formed a barrier between them. He “gave the impression” that aba , fire , was enclosed, unextended, “hermetic,” so it [ aba ] is given the dynamic Virgo [ י ], concealment or absorption. A”A responded by extending an emanation of its own nature (1 + 1 = 2, beth , the second letter, as noted in § 5). In this emanation, a channel was put forth to extend fire, in the dynamic manner of Scorpio. At the same time, maintained was the phase in which fire is concealed, or self-absorbed (Virgo). The scheme here diverges from the old one, signaling the notion that beth , the daughter, is basic to the “success” of creation and linked to its"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS balance and adjustment. In the mode of lamed , beth traverses the extent of the universe at this stage to emend the effects of Z”O, aleph , the son. “Favored” is a crucial word. In Hebrew it is אהיב , which reveals/conceals the daughter’s essential lunar nature and double-lunar dynamic. אהיב = 18, the number of the tarot card qoph , The Moon, Pisces. Pisces’ glyph is two moons back to back. A universe of nine is shown on many versions of The Moon card. The missing sefirah is tiferet , the sun, or son. 18 = 2 x 9; beth x 9; or 9 of azilut + 9 of briah . 9 also connects with yesod , attributed to the moon. The word for moon in Hebrew is לבנה , showing the lamed (mode), beth (the daughter), nun (the Scorpio extension), and heh (the mother). Divided as בנה ל , the word translates “ lamed built.” בנה represents binah , save that it omits the yod ( י ) and so is uncorrupted. 7. T O ESTABLISH THE RIGHT AND LEFT THE WILL CALLED THE RIGHT GIMEL AND THE LEFT DALET , BOTH IN THE CHILD ’ S HONOR . T HE GIMEL TO THE RIGHT EVOKED GEDULAH ; THE DALET TO THE LEFT EVOKED DIN . It is important to keep in mind that, unlike aleph , beth is emanated, and, therefore, of equal stature to aba and aima . Gimel and dalet “honor” beth by showing her divisions, for gimel corresponds to the moon and dalet corresponds to Venus.. The glyphs of the moon and Venus combine to form the glyph of Mercury, the planet attributed to beth . "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS 8. T HE WILL SOUGHT TO ELEVATE AIMA SO THAT THE SON SHOULD NOT SEPARATE HER FROM ABA , FOR IF SHE REMAINED SEPARATE , CREATION WOULD NOT CONTINUE . It was willed that aba and aima not remain as upper and lower—this lower being aima sacrificed. A”A had split into A ba and A ima , but remained in affinity with the second, aima . 0 = 2. Just as beth reflects A”A in one manner, so does aima reflect A”A in this other manner. For creation to continue, concealment (absorption, Virgo) and revelation (extension, Scorpio) had to be equipoised, neither higher. They did remain in stress, for shin abides between them (see § 9). A”A’s division relative to Virgo and Scorpio is concealed in its dynamic, Aquarius, which reflects the æon. J - absorption (arrow concealed) L - extension (arrow revealed) "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS 9. T HE WILL , HAVING SET THE POLES OF RIGHT AND LEFT , ESTABLISHED ELEVATED STATIONS FOR ABA AND AIMA THROUGH HEH AND VAV . T HE WILL SENT HEH TO THE RIGHT , A FEMALE FORM , SO THAT IT MIGHT COUPLE WITH ABA . T HE WILL SENT VAV TO THE LEFT , A MALE FORM , SO THAT IT MIGHT COUPLE WITH AIMA . B ETWEEN THEM WAS SET THE PASSION OF THE WILL : SHIN . I T SET ABA TO RULE OVER GIMEL AND THE RIGHT . I T SET AIMA TO RULE OVER DALET AND THE LEFT . It is important to note that shin comes to be held between aba and aima . It is not male, nor is it in the possession of the male. The self-absorbed nature of aba (Virgo) is determined here. He is rendered remote, concealed. Between A”A and aba is put heh , a version, or reflection, of aima which is sulphuric—in possession of fire. It feeds aba ’s absorption of fire so that he will not tend to retract shin from aima (which, in an out of myth, it is his will to do). This sulphuric path has, previously, been perceived as so utterly allied with aba that in tarot the corresponding trump is called The Emperor. It is, in fact, a reflection of aima , the medial heh ( ה ) in היהוה . NOTE : In the Kabbalah of Maat, the formula יהוה is advanced to היהוה , which more accurately describes “creation” as it is presented here. היהוה has the numerical value of 31. To aima , A”A extends vav ( ו ), which, most significantly, is the Hebrew connective “and.” This reiterates the basic affinity between A”A and aima . By contrast, heh ( ה ) is in Hebrew the function word or definite article “the,” or “the one separate from all others.” "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS 10.

AND A”A EXTENDED BETH THROUGHOUT . B UT THE SON , Z”O, COULD NOT BEAR IT , FOR HE WAS RECEIVING ALL IN FULL POWER , YET HE COULD NOT EXTEND , SO HE SHATTERED . The shattering of Z”O is parallel, though with different implications, to the Lurianic concept: THE BREAKING OF THE VESSELS . This shattering concept explains why, in the old system, Z”O- vav -Microprosopus had six spheres attributed to it—these conventionally abbreviated into the attribution of tiferet . The horizontal position of Z”O, as aleph , prevented him from having the ability to “extend.” This cannot work, for any reception must be balanced by a bestowal. Since Z”O could only receive, he shattered. In a related mythic scheme, Z”O is shown as “spoiled” and unwilling to part with anything which comes into his possession. In this version of the story, he is eventually crushed beneath the weight of all he tries to carry. Notice that the shapes of the letters cheth and zain reflect the shapes of the letters heh and vav : cheth - ח : heh - ה zain - ז : vav - ו"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS 11.

A BA AND AIMA WITHDREW , FOR THEY LOATHED THE SON ... HE HAD MADE THEM FIX THE END BEFORE ITS TIME . These two sections (§§ 11 and 12) and the ones which follow speak of the revisions which truly mark the establishment of the æon of Maat—as opposed to the æon of Horus. In the Horus-embracing system, its tree and its dogma, Z”O was supposedly in affinity with A”A as Microprosopus and Macroprosopus. But Z”O has failed due to his inability to bestow. The Z”O/Horus dynamic has displeased its “parents,” for it has proven retrogressive, repeating the errors of the father ( aba /Osiris) in being absorptive—and this at the expense of the mother ( aima /Isis). Anything at the expense of the mother is also at the expense of the daughter ( nukva /Maat), for both are heh ( ה ). The greatest error of Z”O/Horus is in its failure to acknowledge that both aima and nukva are of the nature of the source, A”A. The lamp created is in [the sefirah ] da’at , which, in the æon of Maat, is an empowered sphere. There is no abyss. The abyss is a protective [some say cowardly ] contrivance to prevent Z”O ( tiferet /son/sun) from receiving supernal transmission before having attained KNOWLEDGE , namely da’at . Lo, even this projection has been abused by Horus/Osiris in its mystified mockery of KNOWLEDGE known as initiation . "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"2007 2 P RIMARY T REE A TTRIBUTIONS 13.

T HE LOWER WAS BUILT BY NUKVA ALONE , BEGINNING WITH MERCY : KAPH . With thav fixed, and with aba and aima in withdrawal, the upper and lower halves [of the tree] did not reflect one another. That this was even possible demonstrates Z”O’s failure to provide the reflexive function, namely to receive and bestow. This is his “weakness.” Nukva , on the other hand, forged an alliance with the mother, aima . By her stir to sacrifice (bestow) on account of aima ’s sorrow, nukva is given control of fire, hence, of azilut , and subsequently briah . The crown of nukva set at the base is the moon, which corresponds to gimel . The moon remains the planetary attribution or the tree’s base and foundation, yesod . Nukva ’s sacrifice reiterates her affinity and identification with aima , for it was originally aima who sacrificed herself to reflect the will. (See § 4.) 17. ADDENDUM Since the æon of Horus persists, and the æon of Maat has yet to “dawn on” the world-at-large, it is of great interest to register the completion of the myth begun in the text. Actually, there are several completions, all having the same basic theme: because Z”O persists in corrupting and confusing the processes of the tree by holding aleph , nukva seeks to destroy him. In one version, nukva takes the form of a female praying mantis. Not wanting to be left out of the goings-on, Z”O likewise take the form of a praying mantis, but male. Nukva seduces Z”O into coupling with her (controlling “fire”) and, once conjoined, she sets to devouring him. In another version, Z”O is tempted into confinement in the sun ( tiferet ) with gold and flattery. Nukva set him in this spot knowing that it would eventually be burnt to ashes, dispersed, and reverted to the female, becoming the womb of the tree. "}]
