Copyright (c) 1975 and 1990 by Bill Heidrick Crowley's Star Sponge vision at Lake Pasquaney a round 1916 e.v. was a very profound perception but a very ordinary conception. Crowley saw \"Nothingness with twinkles \" and elaborated the vision subsequently to include many insights. \"... Each stage in the process was like the joy of a young eagle soaring from height to height in ever increas ing sunlight as dawn breaks, foaming, over the purple h em of the garment of ocean, and, when the many coloured rays of rose and gold and green gathered themselves together and melted into the orbed glory of the sun, with a rapture tha t shook the soul with unimaginable ecstasy, that sphere of rushing light was recognized as a common-place idea, accept ed unquestioningly and treated with drab indifference because it had so long been assimilated as a natural and ne cessary part of the order of Nature. At first I was shocked and disgusted to discover that a series of brilliant re searches should culminate in a commonplace. But I soon unde rstood that what I had done was to live over again the tri umphant career of conquering humanity; that I had experienc ed in my own person the succession of winged victories that had been sealed by a treaty of peace whose clauses might be summed up in some such trite expression as \"Beauty depends up on form\". It would be quite impracticable to go fully into the subject of this vision of the Star-Sponge, if only because its ramifications are omniform. It must suffice to reiterate that it has been the basis of most of my work for the last five years, and to remind the reader that the essential form of it is 'Nothingness with twinkles. '\" --- From Crowley's new comment to \"Liber AL\", C h. I, v. 59. (See also \"Confessions\" p. 810 and ff; \"Liber Aleph \" generally in many of the passages citing the term \" Star(s)\"; and many passages in \"Vision and Voice\".) This vision discovered the concept of a simple mathematical field, later extended to include vecto r and functional fields. Crowley's contact with Sullivan (see \"Confessions\", p. 922) led him to investigate mathe matical authors. He was deeply impressed with the writings of Bertrand Russell and A. Eddington. Crowley's inter est in the mathematics of fields and series came to domina te many passages of his later writings, especially the comm entaries to \"Liber AL\" and \"Liber LXV\". What made the Star Sponge vision pivotal for Cro wley was his state of readiness at the time he perceived the relation. Some studies and experiences, especially initiations, must occur in sequence."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" \"Digamma-chi SEQUITUR DE HAC RE.\" \"I believe generally, on Ground both of Theory a nd Experience, so little as I have, that a Man must fi rst be Initiate, and established in Our Law, before he may use this Method.

There is nothing new or revolutionary in Chaos Magick. It is the common practice of all students of the mysteries, and a beginning to serious work. Study o f established systems is necessary. From Crowley's spontaneous (Chaotic?) vision of the Star Sponge, a trivia in itself, he went on to discover the ramifications of this vision in the accumulated lore of mathematics. Had he not done that, he would have spent much time \"rediscove ring the wheel\". As it worked out, Crowley was able to appl y elementary field theory by metaphor to teleology an d, less successfully, to sociology.  -oOo- \"4. The fifty gates of Binah have been variously e xplained. They do not appear to be of any great importance; i t is only their number which is significant. The reference i s to Nun = 50 = Scorpio Atu XIII -- Death.\" --- from \"Cry of 14 Aethyr\", \"Vision & Voice\", page 82, fn 4. The 50 gates of Binah were not directly understo od by Crowley as such, but he acquired the conception thr ough time and personal experience. The essential idea behind the 50 gates appears in many of his writings and attainmen ts; e.g., \"Wakeworld\" in \"Knox Om Pax\", and \"Vision and Voice \". Crowley missed the significance of the G.'. D.'. diagram of the ten Sephiroth in seven palaces in this conju nction. That diagram (\"Equinox\" Vol I, No. 2, \"Temple of So lomon the King\", p. 272, Dia. 27) shows the distribution of t he ten Sephiroth into seven palaces, and is a representati on of the exact moment of the opening of the fiftieth gate -- - the crossing of the Abyss. At that moment Malkut and Y esod merge and the upper three Sephiroth appear as one, as Binah. Crowley was aware of this from direct experience, a nd noted seeing the Supernals as one Sephira on first crossi ng the Abyss. Unlike his experience with the \"Star Sponge \" vision, he apparently did not identify this with a pre-exis ting body of knowledge, the tradition of the Fifty Gates of Understanding. Very Probably this oversight can be blamed on the old Golden Dawn representations of these 7 p alaces and the Beast of Revelations in a Christian negativ e view. See \"Equinox\" Vol. I, No. 2, p. 275, Dia. 33 and p. 283, Dia. 51, where the Beast is associated with the pal aces. Most of the speculation concerning it has dealt wit h things like the seven hills of Rome, Christian heresies co ncerning \"Satan\", Antichrist and the like. This Beast is a relic of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"gnostic and prechristian mysticism of unknown antiq uity. \"Revelations\" is itself a forgery, with the visions copied from prechristian Merkabah sources. The Beast with 10 horns and 7 heads is a variant of the serpent on the 32 p aths of the Tree of Life and an alternative to the diagram of the seven palaces. There is a list of the Fifty Gates of Binah or Understanding in the back of a translation of the \" Sepher Yetzirah\" by Wescott, although not in all editions, and the original of that list is in Kircher's \"Oedipus Aegy ptiacus\". Westcott took liberties with his source. He change d gate 41 and removed material from the description of gate 5 0, concerning Moses. His translations of the Latin ar e sometimes distorted by pre-conceptions. Gates 41 t hrough 49 also contain an original confusion of the prechrist ian Qabalistic angelic orders with the 5th century Hier archies of Pseudo-Dionysus. from Westcott's \"Sepher Yetzirah\", 1911ev, 3rd E d. \"The Fifty Gates of Intelligence.\" \"Attached to some editions of the Sepher Yetzirah is found this scheme of Kabalistic classification of knowledge emanating from the Second Sephira Binah, Understanding, and descending by stages through the angels, heavens, humanity, animal and vegetable and mineral kingdoms to Hyle and the chaos.

The examples of the fifty gates presented above demonstrate one of two principal forms of the gates of Understanding. These first two examples are repres entative of the higher of the two forms and can be related t o the Tree of Life diagram. According to Krakovshy's \"Ka bbalah: The Light of Redemption\", pp. 155 to 157, gates 1 t hrough 10 are the ten Sephiroth of a tree growing within the conjoined Malkut-Yesod-Tipheret of a greater tree. Thus gate 1 is Malkut within Malkut-Yesod-Tipheret. Gate 2 is Yes od within Malkut-Yesod-Tipheret. This continues with gate 10 being Keter within Malkut-Yesod-Tipheret of the greater. Gates 11 through 20 are a tree of ten growing wi thin Hod of a greater tree. Gates 21 through 30 are a tree of ten growing wi thin Netzach of a greater tree; e.g. gate 24 is Netzach of a lesser tree that grows within the Netzach of the gr eater tree. Gates 31 through 40 are a lesser tree growing wi thin the Geburah of a greater. Gates 41 through 50 are a lesser tree growing wi thin Chesed of a greater --- yet the fiftieth gate touch es a bond with Binah of the greater tree. Through Binah the f iftieth gate is distantly united with Chokmah of the greate r tree. Chokmah of the greater reaches to Keter of the grea ter. Keter of the greater touches Ain Soph Aur and becom es eternal by that touch. The second and lower of the two forms of the fift y gates of understanding has a structure curiously like cer tain of Crowley's methods. Each of the lower seven Sephiro th holds"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"a truncated tree of seven. These lesser trees are cut short by the fear that dwells in the mortal spirit of hum an kind. This spirit knows that it is but a spark before a g reater fire; yet it fears to draw the greater lest it vani sh without a trace. The lesser spirit has no need to fear dissolution, for the greater fire takes its essence from the changing sparks that shine within its flame. This lesser spark is akin to Crowley's idea of Hadit while the greater fire is akin to Nuit. The difference here is an em phasis on \"fear of encounter\" rather than on desire for union . Here is an example of the second form of the fif ty gates of Binah. It is said to be lower only from the gre ater being a perspective natural to one above the Abyss and the lower to that of one who is striving to cross the A byss. 1. Malkut within MALKUT.

The fifty gates of understanding can also be use d in ritual meditation. The second approach to interpret ing the fifty gates (below the Abyss) forms a structure for a negative confession like that found in the \"Egyptia n Book of the Dead\". In this, seven statements of purity are made for each of the seven lower Sephiroth. These are not t o be memorized, but are made up on the spot by the ritua list each time. Each statement corresponds to a Sephira with in each of the seven Sephiroth according to the pattern sho wn just above. Seven times seven is forty-nine statements in all. Each statement must take the form of a denial of fa ult, corresponding to the combination of the Sephiroth. The depth and soul-searching quality of the forth-nine truths determines success or failure. When the ritualist can say all forty-nine of these statements truthfully, the fiftieth gate will open into the Supernals though Binah. It is not necessary for the statements to be accurate in rega rd to one's everyday life. This procedure gradually form ulates a higher self from of the normal personality. The fo rm of the statements should begin with \"I have not ...\" and c onclude with a denial of fault; e.g. \"I have not cheated an yone.\" \"I have not lied to anyone.\" and so on. This pract ice is given at greater length in my booklet \"Magick and Q abalah #1\", pp. 24-27. Note ... In the above article, Hebrew Letters have been represented by English letters.

Back on the HGA &c. string: The reason you don't say \"Fire, Fire\" in that place is that it looks like a sparkeling sheet of water, act ually a sort of Paroket Zohar. 93 93/93 Bill Heidrick 50 Gates a Jewish perspective My own knowledge of this subject is based on the bi blical writings and commentaries. The 50 gates are really 49 days or 7 weeks of self-elevation and self-evaluation (followed by one day of prophet ic revelation) that the Israelites strived for from the time of th e Exodus from Egypt until the time they received the Ten Commandments at Mt. Sinai. It is said that all of Israel experienced prophecy at this time and heard the voice of G-d (Kol Hashem) declare the first two commandments . How is it possible for an entire nation to be able to experience prophecy? This is the secret of the 50 Gates of Understanding . Being worthy of receiving prophecy requires charact er improvement. There are 49 aspects of character that the Israelites wor ked on developing while they wandered in the dessert of Sinai. Thes e aspects correspond to the combinations of the 7 lower sefirot which ar e called midos or character qualities from the Hebrew. The counting is done backwards from the highest lev el to the lowest since prophecy is energy transferred from G-d to man.
