[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"An introduction to the Kabbalah for beginners This, for you dearest beginner (we were all beginners at some time), is as simple as it gets. You will need to virtually learn this introduction off by heart. From he re on prepare to expend blood, sweat, toil and tears. Make no mistake, if you make the decision to cont inue you are about to take the first step on a lifetime's journey. The word Kabbalah is derived from the root Qibel (Q BL), which means \"to receive\". This refers to the a ncient custom of transmitting Kabbalistic knowledge by the method of oral transmission. The Kabbalah is the \" received\" doctrine, the esoteric side of the scriptures, the \"Chokmah Nistorah\" or Secret Wisdom of the Inner Sc hool, that is the inner truth as opposed to the outer form. The Kabbalah is, in essence, an esoteric system of personal self-initiation. It cannot be taught to an yone; it must be experienced by every individual in their own unique way. The real secrets and true mysteries of the Ka bbalah must be discovered for and by oneself. This introduction and indeed any of the other texts are not designed to teach you the Kabbalah, but rather they are here to help you understand its fundamental principles and tradition s. The Kabbalah is properly classed under four heading s: 1. The Practical Kabbalah (Talismanic and Ceremonial M agick). 2. The Literal Kabbalah: Divided into three parts: 1. Gematria (Grk. \"Geometria\") 2. Notariqon (Ltn. \"Notarius\", a short hand writer) 3. Temurah (Heb. \"Permutation\") 3. The Unwritten Kabbalah (only communicated orally). 4. The Dogmatic Kabbalah (the doctrinal portion). In Kabbalistic philosophy there are Four Worlds whi ch constitute the Universe. After a certain manner they correspond with the Four Magical Elements. The Four Elements of Fire, Water, Air, and Earth are reflec tions of the Four Worlds of the Kabbalah. Thus is fulfilled the divine saying, \"As above, so below.\" The Four Worlds and the Four Elements correspond wi th the Four Letters of the Tetragrammaton (Yod-Heh- Vav- Heh or IHVH), which is the so-called Incommunicable Name of God which, in occult science, represents a magical formula of supreme universal importance. The Four Kabbalistic Worlds are: • Olahm Ha-Atziluth (World of Emanations or Archetypa l World) Atziluth is the World of Emanations and corresponds with the element of Fire and the letter Yod of the Tetragrammaton • Olahm Ha-Beriyah (World of Creation. Also called Kh orsia, Throne) Beriyah is the World of Archangels and corresponds with the element of Water and the letter Heh of the Tetragrammaton • Olahm Ha-Yetzirah (World of Formation and of Angels ) Yetzirah is the World of Angels and corresponds wit h the element of Air and the letter Vav of the Tetragrammaton • Olahm Ha-Asiyah (Material World. Also called Olahm Ha-Qliphoth, the World of Shells) Asiyah is the World of Action and corresponds with the element of Earth and the final letter Heh of th e Tetragrammaton In each of the Four Worlds there is contained a Tre e of Life. The Tree of Life is, after a certain fas hion, a symbolic figure of the Universe. It is made of Ten Spheres ( Sephiroth) and twenty-two Paths connecting them. Si nce there is a Tree of Life in each of the Four Worlds, there are forty Spheres in all. Yet in each Sphere there is c ontained its own Tree of Life and in each Sphere of that Tree is con tained yet another Tree, so that there are an infin ite amount of Trees and Spheres in Kabbalistic Philosophy."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life is, after a certain manner, a \"wes tern mandala\". It is a supreme magical symbol of al l the forces which constitute the operations of the Universe in its evolving scheme for absolute freedom of express ion. It is a perfect model of the Universal Plan and it plays a great role in the training of any Magician. It comp rehends and synthesizes all forces, forms, and concepts of the Universe, and it embraces all essential keys to att ain true union with the Divine. There are, in the Kabbalah, three essential parts o f the Soul. These are: • Neschamah (Soul, Intuition) • Ruach (Spirit, Mind) • Nephesch (Animal soul) Neschamah is the Supernal Triad of Kether, Chokmah and Binah on the Tree of Life, but most especially is it related to Binah. Ruach is the next six Sephiroth (Chesed t o Yesod). Nephesch is Malkuth. Eliphas Levi said the following concerning the thre e parts of the Soul: \"The body is the veil of Nephe sch. Nephesch is the veil of Ruach. Ruach is the veil of the shro ud of Neschamah.\" There are also two other parts of the Soul in Kabba listic Philosophy. These are called the Yechidah an d Chiah. The Yechidah (Indivisible Self) is related to Kether; t he Chiah (Life Force, or True Will) is related to C hokmah. These two are contained in the Immortal Neschamah. The Neschamah is represented in Tarot by the Empres s Atu (Card III of the Major Arcana). The Empress i s Isis in Nature, and also the Queen of Heaven. She is the so urce and the fulfillment of all sublime things terr estrial and celestial, material and spiritual. She is Mother Ve nus, Goddess of all. The symbol of Venus, which is also the symbol of Woman, is a Cross surmounted by a Circle. It is a symbol which contains in itself the idea o f all the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life; it contains all of t he forces of Nature, just as the Holy Neschamah con tains all. In the Hebrew language there are twenty-two letters . These correspond with the twenty-two Paths of the Tree of Life. The Hebrew Alphabet has been properly called the Holy Alphabet of the Gods and the Angelic Alpha bet. The famous Sefer Yetzirah divides the twenty-two Hebrew letters into three classes of three, seven and twe lve. These are: • The three Mother Letters (Aleph, Mem, Shin). • The seven Double Letters (Beth, Gimel, Daleth, Kaph, Peh, Resh, Tav). • The twelve Single Letters (Heh, Vav, Zain, Cheth, Teth, Yod, Lamed, Nun, Same ch, Ayin, Tzaddi, Qoph). The three Mother Letters correspond with the three Philosophic Elements of Air (Aleph), Water (Mem), a nd Fire (Shin). They also correspond with the three Gunas o f Samkhya Philosophy (Aleph = Sattva, Mem = Tapas, Shin = Rajas) and also with the three Principles of Alkhem i (Aleph = Mercury, Mem = Salt, Shin = Sulphur). Th ese three letters are reflections of the Supernal Triad of Li ght, Wisdom and Understanding. The seven Double Let ters correspond with the Seven Ancient Planets, the Seve n Chakkras, the Seven Alkhemical Metals, the Seven Steps of Initiation, the Seven Days of the Week, the Seven E lohim or Spirits of God, the Seven Eyes of God, the Seven Archangels, the Seven Masters, the Seven Steps of S olomon's Temple, the Seven Colors, the Seven Senses , and the Seven Musical Tones. The twelve Single Letters corr espond with the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. The twenty-two Paths also correspond with the twent y-two Atus of Thoth, or the Major Arcana Cards of t he Tarot numbers 0-21. Aleph is The Fool, Beth is The Magici an, Gimel is The High Priestess, Daleth is The Empr ess, Heh is The Star (or The Emperor), Vav is The Hierophant, Z ayin is The Lovers, Cheth is The Chariot, Teth is S trength (or Lust), Yod is The Hermit, Kaph is The Wheel of Fort une, Lamed is Justice (or Adjustment), Mem is The H anged Man, Nun is Death, Samech is Temperance (or Art), A yin is The Devil, Peh is The Tower, Tzaddi is The E mperor (or The Star), Qoph is The Moon, Resh is The Sun, S hin is Judgement (or The Aeon), and Tav is The Worl d (or The Universe). The twenty-two Paths are microcosmic realities whic h concentrate and equilibrate the macrocosmic force s represented by the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life. T hey are subjective, whereas the Sephiroth are objec tive. Each Path is a door to achieving union with the divine f orces of the Universe, and they inevitably lead to the Secret Wisdom. The force of each Path is represented by it s corresponding Tarot Card related to its correspon ding Hebrew letter. Thus the eleventh Path of Aleph is The Fool on the Tree of Life. This particular Path connects Kether and Chokmah, and represents the spiritual consciousness related thereto. The Sefer Yetzirah speaks of Thirty-two Paths of Wi sdom. Thirty-two is the numerical value of the word Laib (LB) which means the Heart of Man. Thus the Thirty-two P aths are the occult mysteries of the Doctrine of th e Heart."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"These are the Ten Sephiroth and their twenty-two co nnecting links on the Tree of Life. Sephira is sing ular, Sephiroth is plural. It means \"numerical emanation. \" The first Sephira is called the Crown or the Inscru table Height; the second is called Wisdom; the thir d is called Understanding; the fourth is called Love, Mercy or Majesty; the fifth is called Severity, Justice or F ear; the sixth is called Beauty; the seventh is called Victory; the e ighth is called Splendour or Glory; the ninth is ca lled Foundation; and the tenth is called the Kingdom. The Ten Sephiroth have a direct relationship with t he Sun, Moon, Planets and Elements. Pluto correspon ds with Kether or the Crown; Uranus corresponds with Chokma h or Wisdom; Saturn corresponds with Binah or Understanding; Jupiter corresponds with Chesed or M ercy; Mars corresponds with Geburah or Severity; th e Sun corresponds with Tiphareth or Beauty; Venus corresp onds with Netzach or Victory; Mercury corresponds w ith Hod or Glory; the Moon corresponds with Yesod or the Fo undation; and the Four Elements of Fire, Water, Air , and Earth correspond with Malkuth or the Kingdom. All the pla nets have been listed but Neptune. Neptune correspo nds with the so-called Invisible Sephira on the Tree of Life . This hidden Sephira is called Daath or Knowledge and is located in the Abyss below Chokmah and Binah on the Tree. I t was the original location of Malkuth before the s o-called Fall of Man. The Ten Sephiroth correspond in Tarot with the Mino r Arcana cards: 1. The four aces are Kether 2. The four twos are Chokmah 3. The four threes are Binah 4. The four fours are Chesed 5. The four fives are Geburah 6. The four sixes are Tiphareth 7. The four sevens are Netzach 8. The four eights are Hod 9. The four nines are Yesod 10. The four tens are Malkuth Each of these Minor Arcana suits represent the oper ation of one of the Sephiroth in a particular eleme nt: 1. Wands represents the operation of Tiphareth in the element of fire 2. Cups represent the operation of the Sephiroth in th e element of Water 3. Swords represent the operation of the Sephiroth in the element of Air 4. Coins/Pentacles represent the operation of the Seph iroth in the element of Earth The Tree of Life contains three Triads. The first t riad has been called the Intellectual World or Olah m Mevshekal, the second is called the Moral World or Olahm Morga sh, and the third is called the Material World or O lahm Ha- Mevetbau. These three triads have been properly def ined by Dion Fortune as the Supernal Triad, the Eth ical Triad and the Astral Triad. The Tree of Life is, to all practical intents and p urposes, an occult system of classification. It sho uld be committed to memory by every Occultist and it should become the automatic background of all their thinking. For the Kabbalistic Tree of Life should play a vital role in the traini ng and initiation of any Magician. Every idea and e very experience should be classified in the Tree according to the o ccult principle of analogy. By this means the pract icing Magician will organize his mind and strengthen his magical k nowledge, and he will inevitably be able to unify t hat knowledge and transmute the Many into the One. The three principal Kabbalistic Books (All available on this site) are: • The Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Formation) • The Sefer Ha-Bahir (Book of Illumination) • The Sefer Ha-Zohar (Book of Splendour) Other important books (Eventually to be available on this site) are: • Sefer Raziel (Book of Raziel) • Sefer Sephiroth (Book of Emanations) • Asch Metzareph (Book of Purifying Fire) The Sefer Yetzirah was written down in Hebrew by a man named Akibha ben Joseph, who was a Rabbi of the first century. It first appeared in actual print in a Lat in translation by a man named William Postel, which was published in Paris in 1552, and ten years later the original Hebrew appeared in print. Akibha founded the first Kabbalistic School. He was succeeded by his pupil named Simeon ben Yochai. Akibha suffered persecution by the Roma ns, and was finally martyred by them. Sefer Yetzirah did no t originate in the mind of Akibha; it was transmitt ed to him orally; he was simply a scribe of the Ageless Wisdo m. The mythical Abraham, as tradition has it, was t he true"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"originator or receiver of the Sefer Yetzirah. Tradi tionally, Abraham is the author of the Kabbalah, an d it was to his son Isaac that he transmitted its Sacred Wisdom, wh ereas to his other son Ishmael he transmitted the s acred mysteries of Alchemy. The Sefer Ha-Bahir is attributed to Rabbi Nehunia b en haKana. The Bahir is one of the oldest and most important of all Kabbalistic texts. Until the publication of the Zohar, the Bahir was the most influential source o f Kabbalistic teachings. It is quoted in virtually every major Ka bbalistic work and is cited numerous times by the R amban in his commentary on the Torah. It is also paraphrased and quoted many times in the Zohar. Sefer Ha-Zohar was said to be composed by Simeon be n Yochai, the pupil of Akibha. But it was not writt en down until the year 1290, from the pen of Rabbi Moses be n Leon. It was written in Aramaic by him under the pseudonym of Simeon ben Yochai. Moses ben Leon was certainly the first to write it down, but its origin is much older. Much of the Zohar goes back to Mishnic times, around A.D. 7 0- 200. The Zohar first appeared in printed form in the Hebrew language in Mantua in 1558. The Zohar is essentiall y a commentary on the Torah (Pentateuch). "}]
