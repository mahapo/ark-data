[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Unspeakable Name of God in Kabbalah Dear Chaverim, The vowelized vocalization of the four-letter, Inef fibale Name of God, the Shem HaMeforash, YHVH, was known only by the High Priest of the Temple in Jerusalem, and uttered by him only once each year, on Yom Kippur, and then, only in the Holy of Holies. So holy, so powerful was th is secret name that anyone other than the High Prie st who uttered it would die -- and even he could be st ruck down by God if he mispronounced it for some re ason. As a result, the High Priest entered the Holy of Ho lies alone on Yom Kippur with a rope tied around on e ankle; thus, in the event that he should be struck down by YHVH for mispronouncing the Shem HaMeforash, the seconda ry priests could pull him out of the room so that he c ould pass on the vocalization of the Name to one pr iest before he expired. With the final destruction of the Temple and the re sultant passing of the office of the Kohain Gadol ( High Priest), the true vocalization of YHVH, the most-high \"Name, \" was lost. Only the \"High-Priest-To-Come,\" which i s to say the Messiah, would know its true pronunciation and be authorized to speak it. Thus, Jesus prays to God , \"I have made your Name known to the men you took from the w orld to give to me\" (John 17:6) and uses his privel eged knowledge of the Shem HaMeforash as proof of his Me ssianic office by declaring to his disciples, \"The works I do by my father's Name are my witness [that I am the Messiah]\" (John 10:2 5), and \"Whatever you ask for in my name I will do\" (John 14:13) Viewed within this context, Sabbatai Zevi's \"strang e gesture\" of publically uttering the forbidden YHV H can be seen as his proclimation that he was, indeed, the Chosen One of God, the Messiah of Israel and the world. T he exact nature of his vocalization of the four vowels has b een lost, or kept as a secret by the 300-year old T urkish \"Donmeh,\" descendants of the families who followed Sabbatai into Islam over three centuries ago and co ntinue to covertly worship him as the Messiah, while overtly practicing Islam. (There are an estimated 1 0 to 15 thousand such Believers in the world today, mostly in the Levant, who are only recently beginning to surface as a \"lost species\" of Judaism.) Nevertheless, there are numberous possibile ways in which the Shem HaMeforash could have been vocalize d by AMIRA\"H -- and these, by tradition, were transmitte d from the last Kohain Gadol to the great Kabbalist s of his time, and from them to their successors down throug h history who preserved them in the ancient Kabbali stic amulets they prepared. In the second post of this series, I will describe a number of these Secret Names of God preserved in Kabbalistic amulets down through the ages, many of which were u sed for \"magical\" purposes by so-called \"Practical\" Kabbalists -- practioners of the ancient, Left-Hand Path of Esoteric Judaism. Raising up the Holy Sparks together, Dear Chaverim, In the first part of this series I discussed the ba ckground to the mystical and \"practical\" (i.e., mag ical) meaning of the Shem HaMeforash (Ineffibale Name of God) and its se cret transmission through the Kabbalah since its loss at the time of the destruct ion of the Second Temple, and its subsequent passin g of the institution of the Kohain Gadol, or High Priest, wh o was the only living person to know the true vocal ization of the consonants, YHVH. Here, after giving a brief backgr ound, I will describe some of the possible Shem HaM eforashim proposed by Kabbalists. BACKGROUND The Kabbalists have been searching for the Ineffabl e Name through the transmissions they have inherite d from their predecessors over nearly two and a half millennia. As a result, they are able to put forward several N ames of God of increasing complexity. Some of these names have bee n known since at least the first century, although in some instances both the origin and the source of the act ual names themselves have disappeared from knowledg e. (See Hebrew Magic Amulets by T. Schrire, Berman House, 1982.) Various methods have been adopted by Kabbalaists at different times to enable them to reconstruct and/ or remember these lost Names of God. Some of these names, becau se of their great age, have aquired a certain degre e of sanctity to Kabbalists, but the Rabbinate has never been pre pared to accept them. Rashi, for example, the great commentator of the 11th century, and no sympathizer of Kabbalah , flatly states about at least two such elaborate n ames, \"These they [the rabbis] did not explain to us!\" (Kidushin 71a) "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"ANCIENT RENDERINGS OF THE SHEM HAMEFORASH The Monogrammaton, or Single-Letter Name of God This is usually the single-letter \"Heh\" (H) of the Hebrew alphabet. It has the gematria of 5, which co rresponds to the heirosgamos, or mystical wedding of God and Man. Th is is often found repeated five times, as HHHHH, wh ich has the plus-one gematria of 26, or the sum of the Hebr ew letters of the Tetragrammaton, YHVH. That is: [Y=10] + [H=5] + [V=6] + [H=5] = 26 The other single-lettr name of God is the Hebrew le tter \"Daled\" (D), which has the gematria of 4 the a lchemical number of wholeness which is also equal to the Hebr ew word, \"Avoh,\" meaning \"I will come,\" spelled: [Aleph=1] + [Bait=2] + [Aleph=1] = 4 The Digrammaton There are two such names, the first consists of the Hebrew letters Yud-Yud (YY), and the second of Yud -Heh (YH). \"YY\" has the gematria of 20, corresponding to the H ebrew word, Yadoh, \"His hand;\" and \"YH\" has the gem atria of 15, corresponding to \"bigdoh,\" or \"His garment.\" The Trigrammaton These are Yud-Yud-Yud (YYY), Yud-Vauv-Yud (YVY) and Vauv-Heh-Vauv (VHV).The first has the gematria of 30 = Yadayin (\"His hands\"); the second is 26 = YHVH ; and the third is 17 = Chait (\"sin\"). The Substituted Tetragrammaton There are three Kabbalistic methods for substitutin g one Hebrew letter for another to arrive at the sa me but different rendering of a word, phrase or sentence. These are Notarikon, Temurah-Atbash, Temurah-Albam, Temurah-A vgad, and, as we have indicated above, Gematria. Notarikon . The initial letters of each word in a sentence, p hase, paragraph etc. alone are used. This \"compress es\" the text and, thus, even adds to its mystical power . Temurah There are basically three forms of Temurah: \"Atbas h,\" in which the first letter is substituted for th e last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, the second for the n ext-to-last, the third for the third-from-the-last, and so forth; \"Albam\" in which the first Hebrew letter is replace d by the 12th, the second by the 13th, etc.; and \"A vgad\" in which each letter in the Hebrew alphabet is replaced by t he one succeeding it so that, in English for exampl e, a=b, b=c, c=d, etc. There are other forms of Temurah, such \"A ich B'Char,\" but these are too complicated to descr ibe here. Thus, by \"Atbash\" the Tetragrammaton, YHVH, becomes MEM-TZADI-PEH-TZADI; by \"Albam\" it becomes SHIN-AYIN-PEH-AYIN; and by \"Avgad\" it becomes KUPH- CHET-VAUV. The gematriot for these three Temurim are, respectively: 300, 250, and 34 -- whic h correspond to the Hebrew words Yetzir (\"Formed,\" as in Sefer Yetzirah\"), Nair (\"Lamp\", as in Nathan of Gaza's pseudonym, \"The Holy Lamp\") and B'Lev (\"The Heart,\" as in Yakov Leib Frank). * * * * * In the next post of this series, I'll describe the 8-, 12-, 14-, 42-, 45-, and 72-letter Names of God and their Kabbalistic significance. Raising up the Holy Sparks together, Dear Chaverim, In my last post, I described the origin and esoteri c meanings of the One-, Two-, Three- and Four-Lette r names of God in Kabbalah -- that is, \"H\", \"Y-Y\" (\"Y-H\"); \"Y- Y-Y\" (\"Y-V-Y,\" \"V-H-V\"); and \"M-Tz-P-Tz\" (\"Sh-Ay-P- Ay,\" \"K-V-Z-V\"), respectively. Here I will describe the Eight-Letter name and its construction. Before that, however, let me briefly explain why it was and is important for Kabbalists to know the tr ue Shem HaMeforash. Imagine that you have entered a room fu ll of people and you see your new friend George sta nding way accross the room, with his back to you. You want to get his attention so you call to him, but having f ogotten his name for the moment, you shout, \"Harry!\" He doesn't turn around. So you try, \"Bob!\" Still no response. You go through every name you can think of until you finally shout, \"George!\" Sure enough, he turns arou nd and waves to you. BACKGROUND"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This mystical name of God is spelled with the Hebre w letters, YUD-ALEPH-HEH-DALED-VAUV-NUN-HEH- YUD (YAHDVNHY). It is to be found particularly in Kurdistan where it is used extensiv ely in metallic Kabbalistic amulets. (See Hebrew Magic Amulets , T. Schrire, Behrman House, 1966.) It is always writ ten in large and beautiful Ashuri characters in contrast to the rest of the amulet's inscription which is usually in Kurdistani local sc ript. CONSTRUCTION OF THE EIGHT-LETTER NAME The Eight-Letter Name of God is a combination of th e Hebrew letters in the Tetragrammaton, YHVH, alter nating with the four letters of the Hebrew world for \"Lord ,\" or \"Adonai,\" spelled ALEPH-DALED-NUN-YUD. Thus, when combined, we have the name: 1 = YUD [Tetragrammaton] 2 = ALEPH [Adonai] 3 = HEH [T] 4 = DALED [A] 5 = VAUV [T] 6 = NUN [A] 7 = HEH [T] 8 = YUD [A] MYSTICAL MEANING OF THE EIGHT-LETTER NAME This powerful name can be pronounced, \"Yad On-Hey\" or \"Yad V'Heh,\" which can be taken to mean \"Hand of God.\" It is often used in combination with the even -more powerful 22-letter Kabbalistic name, \"Anaktam Pastam Paspasim Deyonsim\" (which I will discuss in a later lecture) as a protective amulet against the Evil E ye and the dangers of Lilith, the Mother of Demons, during chi ldbirth. The holiness of this name is said to be in creased by virtue of its gematria of 91, which is equal to tha t of the Hebrew words Omain (\"Amen\") and HaElohim ( \"The God[s]\"). I'll discuss the other Kabbalistic names of God, an d their meanings, in subsequent posts. Raising up the Holy Sparks together, "}]
