The publication of Sepher Ha Zohar, or The Book of Splendour, which is the palmary Kabalistic text, for the first time in another language than the original Chaldaic, took place in France between the years 1906 and I9H, 1 thus putting into the hands of modern students the best means of judgment concerning the tradition at large. If there be not at the present day much that remains for our agreement in the very interesting literary monograph of Adolphe Franck, entitled La Kabbale* published in 1843 an&amp;lt; ^ reprinted more recently, with some corrections, in 1892, I believe that I shall be in accord with all scholarship that deserves the name if I express my concurrence when he says that the later Kabalists, like Isaac de Loria, Abraham Cohen Irira et hoc genus omne, added mainly their personal reveries to that great text and enfeebled it precisely in proportion as they sought to develop and reduce it into 1 SEPHER HA ZOHAR (Le Ltvre de la Splendeur): Doctrine soterique des Israelites.

I am concerned in the present study with few questions belonging to purely critical scholarship, but in these prefatory remarks a word must be said upon the Zohar in respect of its authority or otherwise on the question of date not indeed with the view of discussing, much less of deter mining so difficult a question, but to shew in the interests of clearness that such a question exists. The text itself belongs to a period in literature which knew nothing of chronological importance and still less of the values attaching to personalities in authorship. It is anonymous in respect of its redaction and it is silent as to the circumstances under which and the imputed time of the world when it came into the ever growing circle of Jewish records. By its hypothesis, however, it is an account of discourses between Rabbi Simeon Ben Jochai and other masters of the mystic understanding of the Law and the Prophets, of whom he was leader and chief. 1 This is the first point of the hypothesis. In respect of the second and last point, it is a record of the debates which took place between certain immediate successors of Rabbi Simeon, who belongs by tradition to the first century of the Christian era, or the period of the destruction of Jerusalem by Vespasian, A.D. 70. I put aside in this connection various texts and extracts or fragments of texts which are, as one may say, imbedded in the Zohar, introduced for the most part at arbitrary points, where they have little or no relation to that which precedes and comes after. It is to this that we owe the preservation of certain parts of a work entitled Sepher Ha Bahir, or Book of Brightness. Their authority has been disputed, but there seems good ground for believing (i) that if the Zohar proper is a work of the early Christian 1 It should be observed that he is the traditional author of the text itself, subject, I suppose, to exceptions in respect of those parts which either give account of his death or of what transpired among his successors after that event.

Speaking generally of all the additamenta, their introduction is so apart from design that they might have been attached by a tran scriber where they suited his convenience, or when he happened to come across some of them. The Book of Concealment, The Greater Holy Synod and The Lesser Holy Synod, which have been made available for some years by more or less pretentious and unsatisfactory translations into French and English, from the Latin version of Rosenroth, are particular instances to the point in this connection. There seems no reason whatsoever why the first should follow one of the closing sections of the Commentary on Exodus, why the second should intervene at an early stage of the Commentary on Numbers, or the third appear at the end of the Zohar, amidst the frag ments of a Commentary on Deuteronomy. It may be said indeed that the last is that which recounts the death of Simeon Ben Jochai, and that hence it is an appropriate conclusion to the work ; but there is no chronological order to be found in the text as a whole, and in the course of many early discussions between the Sons of the Doctrine, it is evident that the great master of Kabalistic sentences has already passed away. The present study is in no sense a sequel to The Doctrine and Literature of the Kabalah ; it approaches the whole question of Zoharic tradition from another point of view ; but as I do not wish it to cover the same ground when occasion might prompt this, it will be sufficient at this point to refer those who are concerned to the consideration which I have given therein upon the questions of date and authority in respect of the vii"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine in Israel Zohar. 1 It represents the views of scholarship at the period, under all reserves that are necessary concerning my own knowledge. The French translation of the Zohar is the work of Jean de Pauly and it has been published posthumously by Emile Lafuma-Giraud, who has completed and corrected it with the assistance of other Rabbinical scholars. The personal views of Jean de Pauly on the whole question of Zoharic antiquity are represented sufficiently by his opinion that the three Idras being The Assembly of the Sanctuary and the Greater and Lesser Holy Assemblies or Synods already named are referable to the second or third century before Christ. M. Lafuma-Giraud says justly that this is rejected by all critical learning. His personal conclusion is that the Zohar as a whole embodies very old materials combined with much that is of modern authorship, which is pre cisely my own opinion, as stated in 1902, while this in its turn was merely the sum of preceding scholarly judgment, or a reasonable mean between various con flicting views. I should add that the Zohar is a literary document in the sense that it bears the marks of its making. It is for the most part, as already indicated, a record of Rabbinical debates, and I suppose that there has been never a champion of its authenticity who dared to say that it was compiled from notes taken on the spot by ear and eye witnesses. Within its own hypothesis it is such of course, but an occasional lapsus memorice deter mines the value of the implied claim in the negative sense, just as we should expect antecedently, and the unknown editor is found on these occasions reminding 1 A.

I do not know whether I was the first to call it a medley, but there is no nearer description of the things therein, regarded as they are. It represents not only the con flicting views developed in the course of a symposium and the occasional harmonies established subsequently between them, as this or another discussion drew to its term, but at different stages of the text many irreconcile- able points emerge into prominence, and it cannot be said that the Sons of the Doctrine are left at the close of all in exact unanimity with themselves, much less with one another. The fact does not signify, and this statement might obtain on the simple ground (i) that the Zohar embodies many independent texts and (2) does not repre sent an ordered system ; but it may be justified more especi ally from my own standpoint, which can be formulated briefly thus. The work is a development of Secret Doctrine, but the root-matter of that doctrine is presumed to be familiar throughout, as we can understand readily when the interlocutors are ex hypothesi initiated therein, are talking among themselves and not for the elucidation of the subject before an assembly unversed therein. While the whole Secret Doctrine may be therefore found in the Zohar, it is accidentally rather than systematically. There may be some indeed who will question whether the complete system can be adduced therefrom, and for its warrants no one will look. At all points there is much that goes before and does not pass into expression, to say nothing of what may come after. In any case, the 1 See, for example, Z., Pt. I, fol. lib; DE PAULY, I, 65, where the scribe forgets as I have mentioned in the text above that Rabbi Simeon is speaking&quot; to his intimate disciples and co-heirs and not writing a book which may be used by the unprepared and the hostile.

IX"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine in Israel teaching of Zoharic Kabalism upon a given doctrinal matter can only be ascertained by the codification of every reference thereto, occurring throughout the texts. This is the task which I have set before me. I could have wished to have added some consideration of the doctrine, so expli cated and harmonised, in the light of more general secret tradition in Christian times, as I understand this and have dealt with it in other writings : but it has been impossible within the limits assigned to the present undertaking. I have not, however, omitted the application, if any, of Theosophical Doctrine in Israel to the mind of Chris tian mysticism in the modern world, which is everywhere and always my real concern and that which I have taken for my province. I said long ago that the Rabbinical doctors in the chairs of the Holy Assemblies are men who are our brothers, and as such it is important to know the kind of message which they communicate to us at the present day. In the decade and more than a decade which has intervened since the publication of my previous study, I have travelled if I may venture so tb say very far in the search after Secret Doctrine, its symbolism and its liter ature. There is naturally something to correct in that which has preceded within the measures of Kabalism, something on points of fact, something in points of view, and these things will be seen to when and if an oppor tunity arises in the future. Meanwhile The Doctrine and Literature of the Kabalah may continue to serve its purpose, as the corrections here intimated are not vital in their nature, more especially for the unadvanced student. So far as concerns the Secret Tradition in Israel, I have reached my term here. Several departments belonging to the same subject in other places and times have been dealt with in earlier works ; that which remains is the Hermetic side of transmission, properly so called, by which I mean the great texts of alchemy. The decoding of this symbolism in any complete sense presents extra-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Preface ordinary difficulties, and it may well be that several years will elapse before the task is finished. I am therefore indicating only that which is my next concern. I mention these personal matters, asking to be forgiven beforehand for what seems extraneous to my subject here and now. It is not so in reality. The Secret Doctrine in Israel is part of a long series undertaken with one object in view, being the demonstration of a great experiment which has been always in the world but has assumed particular forms during the Christian centuries the literature of the Holy Graal, the texts of Hermetic Art, the pageant of the Rosy Cross, the symbolism and ceremonies of Masonry. I have intimated elsewhere that the books of Zoharic Kabalism are to some extent a witness apart, if only for the obvious reason that they are not Christian evidence, though they arose in Christian times. The witness in the open world throughout the whole period has been that of Christian mystic literature. There is one point more which it seems desirable to mention, so that there may be no misconception as to the nature of the present study ; it does not pretend to con tain direct translation anywhere, save and except in those rare instances which are marked as such by means of quotation commas ; it is a work of critical analysis and collation for the, exposition of Zoharic doctrine on the several subjects indicated by the teachings of its sections, and this has been attempted for the specific purpose of proving that behind each and all there lies a single radical and essential thesis which is spoken of in general terms as the Mystery of Faith. It is this thesis which constitutes the vital part of the Secret Doctrine in Israel. XI"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"CONTENTS CHAP. I. THE EARLY STUDENTS OF KABALISM II.

He was himself the pupil in Jewish philosophy of Elias del Medigo, who filled a chair at Padua and wrote two treatises at the instance of Picus, one being on the Intellect and on Prophecy, in 1481-82, which seems to have remained unprinted and was written in Hebrew, like its com panion De Substantia Orbis, the work of 1485, but this appeared at Basle in 1629. It was also edited with a commentary by Isaac Reggio and so republished at Vienna in 1833.

I believe that I have mentioned elsewhere how perilous it would have seemed then to have entered such a field of research. To deny in the particular case that the Zohar embodies the actual discourses of Rabbi Simeon Ben Jochai might have been tantamount to suspecting the authorship of the Pentateuch by which I mean that it would have opened a vast speculative horizon, so that one might have suggested the other. There came a time, and it was not far away, when the treasure of Picus was questioned, when people began to distinguish between a false and a true Zohar, the first as the work of one Moses de Leon, belonging to the late 1 3th century, and the second as something un- demonstrable in respect of age and value. The distinc tion remains at a high point in the world of speculation, because no one has heard of the, second ; it might not be worth while to mention it in the present place save that it gives the opportunity of stating that the manuscript purchased by Picus represented the identical work which has been known for six centuries and over under the name of Sepher Ha Zohar. An index of the codices acquired by him was published in 1651 by the French bibliographer Gaffarel, 1 and in the recent translation of the Zohar its instalments are appended to the various sections. There are innumerable mistaken references, but the index reflects the text ; what is missing in items referred to one section may be found sometimes in another, and though the pains of Gaffarel can in no wise be called representative as an attempted summary it is not even the shadow there is no question that the treasures of Picus are those which we know under the distinctive 1 JACOBUS GAFFAREL : Codicum Cabbalisticorum manuscriptorum quibus est usus JOANNES Picus, COMES MIRANDULANUS, Index, 1651. ^"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Early Students of Kabalism name of Zohar. There is no alternative text and the differentiation given above is a mendacity which can deceive no one. 1 The contribution of Picus de Mirandula to the know ledge of the Zohar in Europe does not exceed to any considerable extent the simple fact of its existence. His short Latin theses, translated in my previous work, cannot be termed representative, nor can anything else from his pen. It remains that he was the first Christian into whose hands the work came in any form whatsoever, and it seems to have been that authoritative form which was represented later on by the Cremona and Mantua edi tions. 2 We shall never know under what circumstances these appeared at their several dates, 3 and so far as I have been able to trace the bibliography of Kabalism, it does not appear that there is any earlier codex in manu script. As he was the first to see the volumes, so Picus was the first to postulate that the Zohar incorporated many elements which are capable of a Christian con struction. 4 I shall deal with this at the close of the present study, when there will be something to say on the fact that the Christian predisposition of which 1 Curiously enough, the report has reached us through Richard Simon, the well-known author of Hist.

The latter is called bibliographically the Great Zohar because it contains certain tracts and fragments which are not found in the Mantua edition, whence the latter has been named the Little Zohar. Other editions are those of Dublin, 1623 ; Amsterdam, 1714 and 1805 ; Constantinople, 1736; and Venice, with the date of which I am unacquainted. 3 The Mantua edition appeared under the auspices of R.

Picus passed away in his youth, 1 or there are indications which lend colour to the possible realisa tion of his great dream that the Latin pontificate itself, in the person of Pope Julius, might have lent an ear to his eloquence and done something to approach Israel from the standpoint of Christianity in Kabalism. 2 Well, it was after this manner that the work began to be known in Europe, and there passed something like a century away, after which the next name to our pur pose is that of William Postel. It was he who translated The Sepher Tetzirah for the first time into Latin, and thus introduced to the curious and learned of Europe the root of all Kabalism concerning the doctrine of the Sephiroth, the powers and virtues of the twenty-two Hebrew letters and the mystery which resides in numbers. I must not say that The Book of Formation is like that legendary grain of mustard which grows into a vast tree, because the Zohar is in no sense its development except in so far as letters and numerations are concerned ; but it ranks as the primitive text of theosophical doctrine in Israel, and the contribution of Postel to our knowledge minute as it is seems much more to our purpose than the detached and almost sporadic Conclusions!

Postel is credited by tradition with a translation of the Sepher Ha Zohar which would be a rare 1 He died at Florence in 1492. 2 The points of correspondence observed by Picus de Mirandula led him to infer that the Zohar contains : (i) The Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, (2) The Fall of the Angels, (3) Original sin, understood as the Fall of Man, (4) The necessity of redemption, (5) The incarnation of the Divine Word. With certain reserves in respect of the Trinity, and what is to be understood by Divine Incarnation, these doctrines are not only to be found in the text, but are of continual recurrence therein, and yet the most surprising thing about the work, having regard to the period of its origin, is the very slight tincture that it has received from the Christianity in the midst of which it originated and developed."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Early Students of Kabalism treasure had it ever come into existence or been main tained therein. 1 I do not know how or with whom the attractive story arose, but some years since it took a very strong hold on the mind of French students and there was a great research after it, terminating as might have been expected. There is, however, rather more basis for the attempt than mere legend, as it is impossible to read PosteTs most memorable work, or Claris Abscondi- sorum, without inferring that he must have been acquainted with the text, and might, therefore, by bare possibility, have undertaken such a task. 2 It speaks of the soul of the Mediator as the first creature of God and the Law, the reconciler of the universe, referred to the Sephira Binah^ which titles and which local habitation are those of Shekinah, according to the Zohar. 3 It is too early in our inquiry to dwell upon this point, for much attaches thereto which will be considered at later stages. This is by no means the only direction in which Postel connects with the chief text of the Secret Tradition in Israel, but it is sufficient on my part to have established the fact without enlarging thereon. Between the period of Mirandula and that of William Postel I have given some space in my previous work to the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but it has been only to shew that the first connects more especially with the practical Kabalah so called, powers of Divine Names, mysteries of numbers, doctrines of angels and demons, drawn for the most part from sources other than the Zohar ; while in respect of the second his 1 Picus de Mirandula is said to have caused the Zohar to be translated into Latin, or alternatively a Latin version was one of the manuscripts which came into his possession by purchase from the unknown Jew. 2 The legend of a Latin version is recurrent. A French gentleman of Lyons is supposed to have purchased a copy in 1890, paying many thousands of francs, and a translation is also ascribed to Gui de Viterbi. There is nothing improbable in the notion that it may have been so rendered, and may be in hiding somewhere, though I do not put much value on the Lyons story. 3 Later Kabalism regarded Adam Kadmon, the Great Countenance as the pre-existent soul of Messiah."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine in Israel use of the word Kabalah has no connection with any theosophy of Jewry. Contemporary with Postel there was John Reuchlin or Capnion, who dedicated his three books entitled De Arte Cab alls tica to Leo X. His work may be best de scribed as a study of Messianic doctrine, the object of which was to shew that He who was expected by Israel had already come. I am not actually certain, but I believe that he was the first to point out that the Hebrew name of Jesus was formed of the consonants of Jehovah = mir with the addition of the second letter fo # = mOT i.e. Jehos- huah. He quotes a large number of post-Zoharic writers on Kabalism, but does not mention the Zohar, at least by name. 1 Reuchlin wrote also De Verbo Mirtfico. Be longing to the same period as Reuchlin, there was Petrus Galatinus, an Italian convert from Jewry, the author of De Arcanis Catholics Veritatis? drawn from the texts of Kabalism into twelve great books in the form of a debate between himself, a certain Hogostratus of whom I know little otherwise and Reuchlin. It is a work of much greater extent and more considerable learning than the books of the last writer and it does mention the Zohar, 1 There are several editions of both these works, and they are in cluded in the collection of Pistorius entitled, Artis Cabalistica Scrip- tores^ Tomus Primus, but the second volume if that was the limit intended never appeared. This publication belongs to the year 1587. 2 PETRI GALATINI : De Arcanis Catholiccc Veritatis, Libri XII, 1672. The text in this edition is followed by REUCHLIN : De Arte Cabalistica. It is of course a reprint, the work itself having been com pleted in 1516, according to its colophon. Those who can suffer its prolixity will not be unrepaid by its reading, even at this day.

But seeing that the Zohar is by its own arrangement a long succession of studies in the five books of the Penta teuch, it would treat these texts point by point under the heads which I have indicated, and present a digest of the commentaries, maintaining the aspect of commentary.

I have there fore approached the subject from the one point of view which is important to my own mind and in the one way that is possible, having regard to the nature of the work. I have taken it as it is essentially, namely, a store-house of Secret Doctrine, and for the use of students of Secret Doctrine I propose to present it, so to speak, at first hand in all its important aspects for the purpose of ascertaining as already mentioned what light it casts if indeed any upon other forms of the Secret Tradi tion, as these have been presented in earlier and more ambitious writings with which I have been concerned in the past. Here is the keynote in respect of my whole research, and if there be another which is second only thereto it is to learn whether the Secret Doctrine in Israel must remain with us merely as an historical land mark, or whether it conveys an understanding of things which, when considered in its true light, is of moment to us as mystics here and now. To complete the circle of these preliminary remarks, I will add that the plan thus outlined will be found in the outcome to include all that is of importance in the alternative scheme that I have mentioned, for by the nature of the case there is no para mount doctrine under the aegis of the Old Covenant, no vital phase of scriptural tradition and no large event in the history of Israel about which we shall not learn in due course, and fully, the mind of the Zohar.

After due allowance has been made for the predilection and enthusiasms of a mystic who has taken the business of the Secret Tradition into his heart of hearts, I shall be glad if those whom I address will be content to believe on my testimony that the Zohar is one of the great books of the world, one also which stands alone and is comparable to nothing save itself; but I have no intention of recommending it to their particular and earnest consideration at full length. In the French translation it contains, roughly speaking, about 1,250,000 words, distributed throughout six very large volumes, and in the absence of a special dedication it will prove frankly unreadable, vexatious even and irritating per haps to the last degree. I am giving an account of its essence on the great subjects of its concern things which a careful collation has lifted out of the mass of material. Beyond these there is all the drift and scattermeal of its speculation, like a vast waste beyond the garden of the wise, arid as a field of quest, arbitrary beyond words as exegesis, out of all reason as thesis and ridiculous at every turn and corner of the streets of thought. I am confus ing images or mixing metaphors rather of set purpose, to produce the kind of effect which is fitting to the kind of subject.

In attempting to educe from the Zohar the root- matter of the Secret Doctrine which it claims to embody, we are brought very quickly to a pause by the fact not merely of many inconsistencies characteristic of the text at large in a variety of lesser respects, but of the ob vious manner in which the great record seems contin ually at issue with itself over matters of prime importance. It is easy to allow for those cases and they are com paratively few in which the doctors correct one another, whether or not they reach an agreement subsequently ; but one seems to be dealing continually with irreme diable variation over clear issues, though in establishing the simple fact at this early stage there will be no occasion to cite instances. I mention it only to indicate my in tention to find as we move forward in our research a middle way, wherever possible, between statements that exclude one another. There are two things, however, for which allowance must be made from the beginning : one is the distinction of aspects, and then a reconciliation may be possible not so much in the middle way as by means of checking and counterchecking allowing for the point of view ; another arises from the fact that the content of the Zohar is made up of materials belonging to different dates, and this is much more difficult to deal with, because the Secret Doctrine of Israel should be in harmony with itself whatever the period. 1 Where either arises we must deal with cases individually, and it is this necessity which will tend to swell the annotations much beyond any limit that I could have desired on my own part. In the last resource we must recognise that the Secret Doctrine issues in a mystery in all directions because 1 Here, as in other cryptic literatures and especially that of alchemy if we can find something which will serve as a key, the house of mystery will give up its treasures, which does not mean that every point of symbolism will be placed of necessity in our hands, but we shall find the principle at work and the true subject.

The remark is in a sense helpful, because those who are in favour of established ways and notions can take their proper warn ing before they go further. And again, in so far as it is possible, I should wish to exclude from the auditorium all those who understand the Scientia Kabalistica as an art of making, consecrating and using talismans and amulets, as a magical mystery concerning the power of Divine Names, or as the root matter of grimoires and ceremonial rituals of evocation. 2 I can at least tell them that they will be saved from disappointment if they go elsewhere for enlightenment : this is no guide to the perplexed in the paths of occult arts. I mention this matter because there is a debased Kabalism, improperly so called, which 1 To give almost a frivolous example of disparities which arise in this way, the Zohar proper everywhere condemns astrology, but The Faithful Shepherd, a tract inserted at different points of the text, acknow ledges one of its root principles.

I have said all that is necessary on this subject in my earlier study, and they are apart from the present concern. The reader may consult also DR. W.

The mind of the Zohar on the subject of the occult sciences will be shewn towards the end of this study, so that there may be no mistake hereon at the term of quest. I mention it at this initial stage, so that there may be no mistake now. I have termed the present chapter The Hidden Church of Israel^ but it is not in the sense of suggesting that there was any formal incorporation, 1 much less that there were secret religious rites and ceremonies in use among a company of adepts ; it was an entirely inward, spiritual and mystic church, for all purposes of which the official forms of the external Holy Assembly would have been held to be of sufficient efficacy, had the Temple, during the period when the Zoharic records came into existence, stood at Jerusalem, as it did in the days of old. One reason is 2 that the Secret Doctrine was judged to be inseparable from the literal or written word ; it was developed sometimes as if to deepen its meaning and extend its office, never to make it void within its own measures or in the place to which it belonged. 3 Our 1 At the same time we do meet with a number of occasional instances, the suggestion of which is almost as if the colleagues formed a College of Initiates. Sometimes it even looks as if there were almost a cere monial manner of imparting mysteries. See, for example, Z., Pt. I, fol. I33a; DE PAULY, II, 124. Again, it is said that the mysteries were guarded secretly in the hearts of those who possessed them and com municated secretly to each other. /., fol. 960 ; I, 550 For further allusions, see ib., fol. I33a; II, 124 ; ib., fol. I55b; II, 212, shewing that what was known by one of the adepts was not always familiar to another; ib., Pt. II, fol. 8b ; III, 3b ; ib., I4a; III, 61 ; ib., fol. i68a; IV, 116 ; ib., Pt. Ill, fol. i8;a ; V, 490. 2 In illustration of this, there is one similitude which says that the Written Doctrine is the candle or lamp, while the flame is the Oral Law. Z., Pt. II, fol. i66a ; DE PAULY, IV, 112. 8 The thesis was that the written word of Scripture, in every passage and syllable, was the word of the living God. The meanings, however, were many, but they are usually reduced to three : (i) the historical sense, which corresponds to the Court of the Temple ; (2) the moral sense, which answers to the Holy Place ; and (3) the mystical sense, which is in analogy with the Holy of Holies."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine in Israel first task is therefore to ascertain what is established in the Zohar concerning the fact of the Secret Doctrine; we must then take in succession the chief points of intimation on external doctrine and religion in Jewry, so as to elicit the sense of that tradition respecting each and all. Lastly, we must find if this indeed be possible * whether the tradition has a central root from which the great tree of the concealed knowledge has grown up ; whether also as I have said and how far we are concerned or perhaps even should be integrated therein as mystics of this day. I must add that while the last point is obviously the most important and vital, it can only be reached by the mediation of the two others. The question is therefore as to the fact of the Secret Doctrine and under what terms it is mentioned in the records. It is of course, broadly and generally, a method of interpreting Scripture, 2 but so far as this expression is to be understood in an ordinary sense as an actual and logical construction of the letter the interpretation, as I have indicated already, is of no value, for the most part. It is, however, to be understood after a mode of its own, and in the light of this it signifies little that the Doctrine, in respect of exegesis, is often arbitrary 1 It is perhaps just to myself if I add in this place that, since I am not concerned with compilations as such, there would have been no excuse for the present work if I had not satisfied myself: (i) that such a root exists, and (2) that its nature can be set forth clearly. This has been implied already in several places. 2 The symbolism of the Secret Doctrine is also extracted from Scriptural words and phrases which antecedently seem far from the mark. The word &quot; waters,&quot; as it is used sometimes in the Talmud, is said to signify the Secret Doctrine, and when David cried : &quot; Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me&quot; (Ps. ii, 12), he was praying for his heart to be opened by the study of divine mysteries. So also it is said : &quot; Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place&quot; (Gen. i, 9). The waters refer to the Secret Doctrine, and the one place designates Israel, whose soul depends from that region to which Scripture alludes in the words, &quot; Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place&quot; (Ezek. ii, 12). The &quot;glory of the Lord&quot; signifies the Shekinah below and &quot;from His place &quot; signifies the Shekinah above. 14"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"&quot;The Hidden Church of Israel to the last degree ; one would scarcely expect it to be otherwise, having regard to the Rabbinical mind. And the great point is that the mills of those lesser gods who are called Sons of the Doctrine ground out great things in their processes pure and precious jewels of the spirit as well as much dust and many rough stones from the matter which they passed through their mills. It is only as if casually that the word interpretation x can be held to apply in any solid sense : the Secret Doctrine is rather the sense below the sense which is found in the literal word as if one story were written on the obverse side of the parchment and another on the reverse side. This is not an exact comparison, but it gives my meaning clearly enough for the purpose. There are hard things said from time to time about the outward sense and they must not be taken too seriously, for the letter was always precious, if only as a vesture ; but the difference between that which was within and without is well illustrated 2 by a similitude which says that those who interpret Scripture according to the literal sense set the Sacred King and His Bride upon an ass, while those who understand it according to a mystic sense mount them nobly on a horse. 3 This notwithstanding, the two belong to one another, because the Written Law is completed by that which is traditional, 4 and the latter issues from the 1 The canon of interpretation is often exceedingly simple : for example, any reference to vegetation coming up out of the ground is explicable by symbolical vegetation, the one and the other being confused together, and either taken to explain the other. In Ps. Ixxxv, u, it is said that &quot;truth shall spring out of the earth,&quot; and literal grass is held therefore to signify truth. 2 The Zohar gives another illustration when it says that the Oral Law enlightens the Written Law. Z., Pt. Ill, fol. 23a ; DE PAULY, V, 61. Z.,Pt. III,275b; VI, 47- * The Written Law is designated in another place under the name of heaven, while the Oral Law is called earth. On the surface this appears somewhat against the more obvious sense and intention, but what is signified may be an obscure counterchange in virtue of corre spondences between things above and below, and this is a recurring Zoharic doctrine. /&, Pt.

We shall see at the proper time that chief among the root doctrines is that Jehovah is one with Elohim in a sense which is very far from the theological understanding of Scripture ; but it is held also that the Written Law is the image of Jehovah, as the Oral Law is of Elohim, meaning the Holy Shekinah, from which it would follow that at heart they are two aspects of one and the same Law. That which is oral is called the voice of the turtle, 1 and it comes from the side of mercy ; it is also the green wood, while the literal Law is the dry, 2 coming from the side of judgment. But as a further instance of the unity in both it is laid down that there are three things which are at once hidden and concealed being God, the Law and Israel itself. The vulgar man sees only the material side, but the initiate discerns also that which is buried within it. In virtue of this bond of union, we meet with intimations occasionally in which terms are applied to the one that seem referable rather 3 to the other. It is said, for example, that the Written Law is above and that which is Oral below, as also that the former penetrates and fructifies the latter. 4 That which is without seems, however, to be clearly a manifestation of that which is within, though there is a sense also in which the Law was regarded as written on high ; but this I should understand to signify that the Oral Law passes into expression here and into 1 Z., Pt.

To conclude upon these analogies: the manifested part bears no comparison with that which is contained within ; that which is essential is called the Soul of Scripture ; the commandments are its body and the tales are the garments thereof.

Cursed be he, says the text, 1 who pre tends that the recitals of Scripture have no other meaning than that which appears on the surface. Scripture, if this were the case, would not be the Law of Truth, the Holy Law and the Perfect Witness, more precious than gold and jewels. If it contained only simple stories and such vulgar elements as of Esau, Hagar, Laban and Balaam s ass it would be possible to produce something better, apart from all inspiration, after the manner of profane books ; but the truth is that every word of Scripture enshrines a supreme mystery, and is capable of sixty methods of interpretation. 2 This is a character istic extravagance, but every one who has followed the quest of the mystic sense knows how manifold it is, and hence no doubt it has been testified that the original Zohar was a load for seven camels. That is like St. John saying : &quot; I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written/ if all the acts of Jesus were reduced into a complete memorial. 3 I am very sure that the beloved disciple was guilty herein of no extravagant utterance, because Christ has been always in the world ; and I am not less certain that the 1 Z., Pt.

Now, it is said that the inner sense of the Law is not less concealed than the world from which it emanates, 1 wherefore the mysteries known to the Sons of the Doctrine are guarded secretly in their hearts. Those who apply themselves to its study receive as their in heritance the world to come as well as that of Jacob, for it is the path of the life to come. 2 He who is so dedicated and so consecrated is accounted as if he had received its sweet and heavenly words on Mount Sinai itself. 3 It is the way of the Garden of the Sacred King and the way of the King Himself. 4 A certain price has to be paid however, for it is said hyperbolically that the study of the Law succeeds only in the case of him who kills himself for the Law, meaning that it is a path of poverty, and a poor man is considered as one who is dead. 6 1 Z., Ft.

It remains with them during that day and returns whence it came. But it would seem that the Sons of the Doctrine are in permanent enjoyment of this added part. He who does not cultivate the mystic science is therefore in a state of deprivation. The soul is brought down by the voice of him who studies the Secret Doctrine and it comes from the land of the living, making him whom it overshadows equal to the angels.

Another explanation is that it is on the side of mercy, and by mercy the world was made : it is the beneplacitum termino carens. We find, moreover, that God created the world by joining thereto the Secret Doctrine. The world was founded thereon, and it is added that so long as Israel is consecrated to its study, so long will the world be stable.

It was needful for the doctors who rose at midnight to clothe themselves for the purpose of study, out of respect to the Shekinah, who accompanies students of the Doctrine.

Adam became acquainted in this manner with Supernal Wisdom, 2 and the celestial choirs came down to be present when he read the book. He was cautioned, however, to conceal it, and he seems there fore to have studied it in silence with recollection of the heart. The book proved later on to be like the Lthet Gradalis or fundamental record concerning the Holy Graal, for it took unto itself wings at need when Adam his advantages notwithstanding fell ultimately into sin. It was clasped in his hands when he was driven out of the Garden of Eden, but thereafter it vanished, and for long and long he lamented the loss of his treasure. Ultimately it was given back to him, in answer to his tears and prayers, 3 by the angel Raphael ; he returned to its study and bequeathed it to his son Seth, who entrusted it to later messengers, so that the Secret Doctrine might be spread through the world. It became known as the Book of Enoch after passing through the hands of that patriarch, 4 and it is said that Abraham penetrated the in heaven and a part on earth, but it is not otherwise described.

The External Law and the Secret Doctrine were both revealed on Mount Sinai, and as Moses transmitted the one to his nation at large so he communicated the other to certain elders, by whom it was handed on.

We can only understand this on the hypothesis that the science in question is concerned at some stage or under some aspect with a most holy mystery of sex, as if some unknown path of splendour and path to the height might open therefrom.

Those who study the Doctrine are set free from fear whether of things in heaven or things on earth, whether of evils which may overwhelm mankind for they are grafted on the Tree of Life and are taught daily thereby. As regards things in heaven, the meaning is that the fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom, has been absorbed by the love of God, which is wisdom in realisation, and the Divine Doctrine cannot be studied without imparting love for the Divine. To walk in the path of the Doctrine is therefore to follow the path of love ; it is said other wise to lead into the way of truth, so that we learn how the soul may return to its Master. It is not the work of a certain day, nor of a certain hour, but one of the day and the night. We come to understand in this manner that the study is a question of life, of living with the face towards Jerusalem, having the aware ness of God in the heart, and herein is the moyen de paruenir, the counsel of real living. We shall understand also why it is added that he who neglects or forsakes the study of the doctrine is not less guilty than if he separated himself from the Tree of Life, for he is leading the life of separation. 1 The last considerations follow, as it seems to me, the ordinary course of thought in the direction to which they belong ; but the extracts out of which they arise are a counsel to those who would study the Secret Doctrine that there is needed a conscious union by intention, con templation, and the art of finding in the heart, so that the heart and mind of the student may concur in an ineffable union which is said to be consummated above.

This point will recur continually, and so shall I look to reach in fine a culmination or term of quest, from which we shall be able to look back over the whole journey and survey it under one light.

The Latin equivalent \\sfine carens, that is to say, without end, and it is customary to translate Ain Soph Aour as Limitless Light, that which is without end being held to be without beginning. Ain-Soph is, however, understood in the Zohar as the limitless mystery of Divine Thought, the centre of all and the secret of all secrets God unknown and unknowable in respect of His Essence. 2 The references to this state of Deity are comparatively few in the Zohar, 3 and it was unknown to the Book of Formation which preceded it. There are im portant developments concerning it in later Kabalism, which located it above Kether in the Sephirotic Tree and regarded this first Sephira sphere or numeration as the Throne of the Infinite, adding that Ain-Soph dwells in the hiddenness thereof. 4 The Zohar testifies: (i) That God is essentially without form, 5 but in His manifestation He is seen 1 Z., Pt.

In those portions of the Zohar which were rendered into Latin by Rosenroth he has introduced an interlinear commentary which gives a false impression as to the re currence of the doctrine throughout the text. M. Franck (La Kabbale, 1843, pp. 173-176) introduces the term Ain-Soph in the course of a long Zoharic excerpt which is difficult to follow on the assumption that it is direct translation. Lastly, Mr. Mathers (The Kabbalah Unveiled^ 1887), who failed to render even Rosenroth s Latin correctly, produces the latter s commentary with additions of his own and increases the confusion further. * See Kabbala Denudata : Apparatus in Librum Sohar, Pars Prima, p. 81. 6 Z., Pt.

So also it was out of the literal sense of Scripture that the doctors derived their exalted notion of things unseen and of Him Who reigns not alone in the world to come but in this which we see with our eyes, Who fills them both and by Whom the soul is replenished on all the planes of being.

Now the Zohar speaks of three Supernal Degrees or Divine Hypostases, and the first of them is called Kether. 1 It is said also that when the world of manifest things was in the state of Tohu, God revealed Himself therein under the Hypostasis Shaddai ; when it had proceeded to the condition called Bohu He manifested as the Hypostasis Sabbaoth ; but when the darkness had disappeared from the face of things He appeared as Elohim. Hereto appertain the words: &quot;And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,&quot; 11 understood as a reference to the sweet and harmonious voice heard by Elijah and termed : &quot;The Voice of the Lord is upon the waters.&quot; 3 This signifies the completion of the Sacred Name Jehovah. Hence in the vision of Elijah it is said that &quot; the Lord (Jehovah) was not in the earthquake :&quot; it was Shaddai. He was not in the fire ; this was Sabbaoth ; but He was in the still small voice, being that of the Spirit of Elohim, and the name of Jehovah was complete. 4 It is said also that this name is composed of four letters, 5 the relation of which to the Divine Essence is like that of the limbs to the human body ; 6 but this notwithstanding, the Hypostases are three only. Now, as Kether is the first, it is to be inferred that Chokmah and Binah consti tute the other two, and the world of Atziluth or Emana tion will be completed in these. They are symbolised by the three bars of the Hebrew letter Shin, 1 which also exhibits their essential unity. We may regard the point as determined by one further statement, according to which the First Light is symbolised by the Crown and the Second Light or Hypostasis forms the second Sephira. 1 Z., Pt.

I now proceed to establish the following Sephirotic division as that which best represents the mind of the original text. To the first world of Alziluth are referred Kether, Chokmah and Einah ; to the second world of Eriah are allocated Chesed, Geburah and Tip here th ; Tetzirah com prises Netzach) Hod and Tesod ; while Assiah is Malkuth, as I have said at the beginning of this study. The ten Sephiroth are therefore contained within the four worlds. According to the Zohar, the Sephiroth are comparable to chariots for the degrees of the Divine Essence, and the word degrees, which is used very frequently in the text, illustrates after a simple manner the idea of gradations in the nature of the Presence as the spheres of manifestation proceed further from the centre. The supernal world contains the highest degrees of which the human mind can conceive by the intellection of faith, and Kether, Chofonah, Einah form an unity therein. It will be seen from previous extracts that Eriah is the world of created intelligence, though it would seem that its content flows over into Tetzirah. The third and the fourth world are not described in the Zohar, but their names indicate that as in Eriah God created the forms of consciousness to which He could manifest Himself by divine modes, so in Tetzirah He produced the pattern, idea or archetype of the visible and material cosmos, referred to Assiah. The names allocated to the ten Sephiroth are on their surface conventional and arbitrary at least in certain cases. We can recognise that Malkuth is appropriate in respect of the visible world, and that Kether is the crown or summit of the entire Sephirotic system.

The source of Zoharic information respecting the ten Sephiroth or Numberings is in the Sephcr Tetzirah or Book of Formation. 1 It is a work which is assigned to several periods by scholarship, and if we take the middle view we should place it very early in post-Talmudic times let us say roughly, the fourth century of the Christian era. A summary of what is found concerning the Sephiroth in this tract is necessary as a point of de parture. They are termed ineffable, without beginning and without end ; they are an abyss of good, but one also of evil ; they are height and depth unmeasured, illimitable on the right and on the left, in each of the four quarters. They are said to give forth the ten numbers, and the correspondences established respecting the latter must apply presumably to the sources from which they emanate. The sequence however seems arbi trary to the last degree, and I have found nothing in the Zohar which can be held to connect therewith. They are briefly as follows : I. The Spirit of God. II. The element of air, meaning the air which is set in motion by the utterance of the voice and which produces in this manner the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. III.

From this point of view, the ten Sephiroth represent doctrines of extension in space and of the Divine manifesting therein. It is said that the Faith ful King rules all these from His Holy Seat, for ever and ever. It will be observed that the names allocated to the SephirotJi are wanting in this description, nor do I pretend to say when or in what work they are met with for the first time. Something will depend on the date to which we assign the Zohar itself: if it is earlier than the commentaries on the Sepher Tetzirah by Judah Halevi and by Eben Ezra, it may have been for all that I know to the contrary the authority for the ten names. It should be noted further that the Sephiroth are repre sented as good and evil equally, which seems reasonable in respect of that world of dimensions wherein both principles manifest. The Zohar has developments of its own on this subject and something must be said of them later. The diagrams which represent the Sephiroth in the form of the Tree of Life are unknown to The Book of Formation, nor can they be deduced therefrom. Here also the origin is doubtful, but a certain form is met with in the Zohar, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it is implied continually therein.

The Middle Pillar is the Tree of Life, and perhaps the two other pillars are together the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil but it is all speculation and all is high convention. There is no evil when these are united with the central pillar, which is called the seventh day, 6 the Sabbath and the tent of peace. 7 It is the peace in particular between the light of the right side and thi.t which in another place is called the darkness of the left. 8 The Talmud and the Mishnah come from the Middle Pillar. 9 There are many contradictory allocations, as for example, when the Middle Pillar is called the son of Tod but also the He, which is Binah.

The holy degrees are declared to emanate from the holy side and the impure degrees from the impure side. 6 It follows that the Zohar bears out the thesis of the Sepher Tetzirah when this work describes the Sephiroth as the abyss of good and evil. It gives no explanation which will help us to understand this, though it speaks in one place of the union between good and evil 7 as a secret or mystery and indicates in another that there is a sense in which the left side is on the way of attainment. 8 It was possibly the difficulties arising from the allocation of evil to spheres in which God was present everywhere 9 that led the later Kabalists to suppose that the ten Sephiroth were repeated in each of the four worlds ; but this development does not really deal with the point at issue, and as there is no further light thereon we must be content to pass over it, remembering that, almost in the words of the text, the Middle Pillar draws the right and left sides, the good and the evil together, in which union evil dissolves as such and the good obtains entirely under the name of Benignity which is that of the Middle Pillar.

We must remember, however, that late Kabalism arose to account for the difficulties, omissions and discrepancies which prevail in the fountain text, and though I have had occasion to make various strictures, these are without prejudice to the fact that the work as a whole was done with sincerity and zeal, whence it is helpful in respect of occasional conciliation and from time to time as reasonable extension and inference. This notwithstanding, I believe that my diagram is more within the logic of the symbolism than are its alternatives in the printed text-books.

Like the Christian Trinity, the letters which are their symbols are called one on account of the unity of God. We will now proceed one step further. Tod and He are the Supreme Mystery, 2 for ever impenetrable. 3 On the Tod are all things based, 4 and it is never in separation from the He. 5 As the prototypical male principle, it has man for another symbol. 6 He is the female principle, 7 and it has woman therefore as its emblem ; it signifies many mysteries, 8 and its true name is Shekinah. Because the letter He is duplicated in the Sacred Name it is said to terminate both the first and second parts thereof. 9 The world was created by the He, 10 or alternatively by the Tod and He in the perfection of their concurrence. 11 The Vau is the &quot; free Son,&quot; 12 and it is this which diffuses all blessings. 13 The Tod unites with the He, as male with female, and gives birth to the Vau as Son. 14 The three dwell together in unity. 15 Vau is the eternal world. 16 So far in respect of the three Divine Hypostases ; but there is the He final which completes the Sacred Name, I An important analogous intimation occurs early in the Zohar. The Scriptural reference is &quot; Let there be light&quot; (Gen. i, 3), which in Hebrew is Titf VP, the first word being the verb in the imperative. It should be remembered here that Hebrew is read from left to right. This word, Yod, He, Yod, is regarded as a symbol of the three Divine Hypostases occurring at the opening of Genesis and designed to shew that the three are one. The first Yod is the Heavenly Father, the He is the Divine Mother, while the third Hypostasis is indicated by the second Yod and proceeds from the first two.

Yod is the Father of all, Vau as seen already is the begotten Son, and Dalelh is the Daughter that is, the Daughter of Matrona. The imagery is exceedingly mixed as this Daughter is said to proceed from the Father and the Son, whereas it is certain in the sense of things and is plain from the text elsewhere that the He primal of the Sacred Name produces in union with the Yod not only the Son, being Vau, but his Sister, who is also her daughter and in the natural succession of the Divine Name is therefore the He final. Here however the Yod as Father is probably implied as abiding with the Divine Mother. Ib., Pt. Ill, lob ; V, 31.

The same subject is continued in The Great and Holy Assembly^ and therein the White Head is described as Ancient of Ancients, concealed of all concealed, and only imperfectly definable. 2 He who is symbolised thereby is the Master with the white mantle and resplen dent visage, and he is also called Holy of Holies. The Countenance is described at great length, the hair and the beard of snow which depend therefrom. We learn that the eyes are without lids because the eyes never close in slumber, 3 as their sacred and beautiful light shines on the worlds for ever. It has been supposed by some modern students who have followed transla tions only that there is no body attached to the White Head, but this is an error, as the navel is mentioned 1 The Assembly of the Sanctuary is inserted towards the end of Part II, 6, and occupies folios 1220 to 1230. The Secret Book, called sometimes in translation The Book of Concealed Mystery, follows Part II, 7, and occupies folios 1760 to I79a. The Great and Holy Assembly is placed early in The Commentary on Numbers, i, Z., Pt. Ill, folios 1270 to 1453. The Little Holy Assembly follows The Commentary on Deuteronomy, 10, Z., Pt.

The White Head was also without beginning and without end before its reign was established and the Crown, that is, Kether was assumed. The reference would seem there fore to Ain-Soph Aour, which pours down into Kether, and we shall see that the White Head is called Ain. At this point the Zohar and the mystical theology of pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite join hands. It should be understood, however, that the White Head is not Ain-Soph, but the first procession therefrom. 3 Ib., fol.

Below this there is the Lesser Countenance and Form, the head of which is in Daath, while the body is extended through Briah, Tetzirah and Assiah, the male being not without the female.

In conclusion as to the Majesty of God in Kabalism, I must add that there is a Zoharic theosophy of the Word, but how the term should be referred in respect of the Divine Hypostases is not easy to determine. The name of Elohim is allocated thereto, 2 but this is a title of Shekinah. Again, it is said that the Word was mani fested in the Sanctuary, because it was indispensable to the existence of the latter on earth that the Divine should be present therein ; 3 but that which we know to have appeared between the Kerubim on the Mercy Seat was the Presence in the form of Shekinah. In the paraphrase of Onkelos the term Meimra was substituted for Jehovah, Who is thus identified with the Word ; but in the Zohar it is held that the Word in Scripture is designated under the term Eereshilh^ because in order to fulfil the work of creation this term was engraven &quot; under the form of a turnstile,&quot; 4 representing the six great celestial directions, 1 Z.,Pt.

Here indeed is one of those allusions through which a vista opens into the unwritten Secret Doctrine.

The symbolism of the thesis is very curious and deep withal herein. The Sacred Name of God presupposes those who can pronounce, or at least conceive it. 1 In this sense the Name exists for man and as antecedent of necessity thereto are the letters which are images of the Word. Now the world is said to have been created by the help of the Hebrew letters, 2 whence it follows that these were produced in the first place or rather their archetypes. They are said to have emanated from one another, 3 presum ably on account of the fact that it is possible to reduce them to a few primitive simple forms. After their emanation, the sacred letters, the Great Letters the letters that are above, of which those on earth are a reflection remained in concealment for a period which is specified as 2000 years before the Holy One pro ceeded further in His work. 4 When He willed so to do the letters came successively before Him, to shew cause why each one of them should be utilised as an instrument in the task. This is mere comedy in the literal understanding and is one of the curiosities of literature in its form of expression, as it is easy to say ; but let us mark what issues therefrom. The letter Beth was chosen, but not because it is the initial of the word Bara, meaning to create, nor yet because it is that of Bereshith, or &quot; In the beginning/ with which the Book of Genesis opens, but because it is the initial letter of the word Barach, which signifies to bless.

It is in virtue of the benepladtum termino carens that the letter Beth was used in creation, and I care not by what devious or grotesque path of thought such a truth is reached, so long as it emerges at last on the Pisgah height with such a sun shining in the eyes. The Zohar is like the Hebrew Scriptures, canonical and sub-canonical ; it is sealed with sanctity. The writers had passed that sacred initiatory degree in which the soul looks for &quot; good things of the Lord in the land of the living &quot; : * they had come to see with their own eyes. Amidst the sorrows and rogations of the Greater Exile, their hearts never faltered nor failed over that faith which opens into sight, or in that hope which begins already to realise itself in participation. The Zohar is therefore like Osiris : it is &quot; true of voice,&quot; and is inspired on every page, not only with the sense of immortality but with that of a conscious communion subsisting ever and continually between the Holy Assembly that is above and the Assembly which has attained holiness below. There is hence a consolation throughout it which seems for the most part to be implied only under veils by the Law and the Prophets. The Divine intention to make use of the letter Beth, for the reason stated, does not concern further the mind 1 Ps. xxvii, 13. 55"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine in Israel of the Zohar, 1 because it has done its work in delineating the motive of the worlds, shewing that the instrument of creation was the power to bless all things.

The pro cedure is symbolised by reciting that the Holy One engraved in the ineffable world those letters which represent the Mystery of Faith, being Yod, He, Vau, He, the synthesis of all worlds above and below. 2 Tod represents the central point and the cause of all things, concealed and unknown for ever, being the Supreme Mystery of the Infinite. 3 It is that point of Divine Thought which has been mentioned previously, and from it there issues a slender thread of light which is itself concealed but contains all lights, receiving vibrations from Him Who does not vibrate and reflecting light from Him Who dbes not diffuse light that is, the mysterious point, or God centralised in thought on the world about to be produced. The slender light lumen exile gives birth to a world of light, which enlightens the other worlds.

Whether it so does depends upon the quality of thought which is extracted in such strange manners as these, and of course it has to be realised that the peg is only a pretext whether Jewish theosophy understood it as such or not. From the manner in which the Secret Doctrine is externalised in the Zohar one can not help feeling that some of its authors knew this in their day, and in no very different manner from that in which I realise it now. The changes are rung after many manners by the great bells of tradition when they peal out the work of creation. The truth which emerges from the far-spreading tissue of reveries is the operating efficacy of the Divine Will in all the manifest universe, together with that which may be held to lie within the measures of the Doctrine of Correspondences, which obtains everywhere in the Secret Doctrine whatever the schools thereof and has been reflected thence into systems which cannot be included in the same category.

But this the Doctrine of Correspondences. Nature, according to the Zohar, is the garment of God ; x it is that in which He appears and wherein He is veiled, so that we can look upon Him and know Him in His vestured aspect ; but it is not the body of God which is more properly Shekinah, at least in one of her aspects and it is still less God manifest. It is that which He took upon Himself for the purpose of appearing. Prior to the period when the Divine Name was formulated for the ends of creation He was apart from the kind of definition implied therein and this non-defined state is termed &quot; Who &quot; by the Zohar, as in the words : &quot; Behold Who hath created,&quot; 2 while the product of creation is called &quot; That &quot; : &quot; Behold Who hath created That &quot;or these things. The Hebrew words are respectively Mi and Elah. The product specified was not, however, for the Zohar, that which we understand by creation but the Elohim below, 3 who thus came into being when the letters emanated from each other. The explanation is that by the pairing of Elah and Mi the Sons of the Doctrine contrived to obtain the word Elohim, and out was assuredly a glass which was common in several respects to other seers besides himself.

In the text itself a discussion follows and there is a divided view. /$., fol. 59b; I, 337. 65 E"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine in Israel down ; but while it is thus a limit in both directions, the firmament is also a bond of union between the one and the other, so that both are united thereby in Elohim.

But there are certain final intimations which belong more especially to our subject and lead therein. When the Holy One created the world He engraved the Mystery of Faith in letters of sparkling light ; He engraved it above and below, because it is the same mystery and because the world below is the mirror of that which is above. By means of the Mystery of Faith He created the worlds. Now, in another place it is asked : What worlds ? The answer is matrimonial unions. 4 These are the worlds which God does not cease from creating. It follows that creation, as the story is told, is a veil of the sex mystery ; it follows also that something is under stood of which physical union is the shadow as this is known here : the intimations concern union as the result of a law, which law is literal on the plane of expression and mystical on a higher plane. Another key is given in these words : The union of the male and female prin ciple engendered the world 5 as indeed it was impossible that it should do otherwise within the measures of Zoharic 1 Z., Pt. I, fol. 2ia ; DE PAULY, I, 129. 2 Ib., fol. 3ib ; I, 196. The Zohar is sometimes like scholastic philo sophy in its lighter moments and seeing that the six days of creation are mentioned by Genesis but not the six nights which are implied therein, it inquires what has become of the latter and concludes that God holds them in concealment for some good purpose of His own. 3 //&amp;gt;., fol. 33b ; I, 208. 4 Ib., fol. 8ga ; I, 511. 5 7.,Pt. 1 1, fol. 228a; IV, 250. 66"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE SEPHIROTH IN CIRCLES Facing page 66"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Doctrine of Cosmology symbolism.

Another story intimates that God took the &quot; heap of letters &quot; in His hands and began to make worlds therewith over and over, but they had no consistence, the reason being that the covenant had not yet been made. 2 The world under the law of circumcision must be understood as a specific dispensation within the mani fest order, and the destroyed worlds are previous dispen sations which arose and decayed unceasingly. This is illustrated when it is said that their destruction was because those who dwelt therein did not accept the commandments of the Doctrine.

It is a matter of some difficulty to disassociate the subject from that Divine personality the Indwelling Glory which is the central figure of the Aramaic text and the full discussion of which I have de cided for good reasons to postpone till the end of our study. It must be explained in the first place that there are two Gardens of Eden which are in communication one with another, while the one leads to the other. 1 The one is the mystery of sex as it was established or rather formulated originally on this lower earth by the hypo thesis of the Secret Doctrine, but this Garden was ravished ; the other is a mystery in transcendence as it subsists in the eternal world, the world of the supernals. In the symbolism of the whole subject, the word of both is womanhood; she is the Garden in transcendence and 1 According to later Kabalism, the Superior Paradise is referable to Briah in respect of souls and to Yetzirah in respect of angels, but this is manifestly opposed to Zoharic teaching, by which it is allocated to Binah and is therefore in the supernal world of Atziluth. The Inferior Para dise is in Assiah according to both forms of Kabalism. We shall see in its proper place that the Higher Eden is probably the abode of souls awaiting incarnation and that the Lower Eden is, so to speak, the threshold of entrance into the life of earth. So also on the return journey through the gate of death the Lower Paradise is a tarrying-place for the souls of the just before they ascend higher, that is to say, into the Supernal Eden, where perfect liberation is enjoyed.

We shall see at a later stage that all these designations are titles of Shekinah as the Divine Personality which I have mentioned and she can be regarded from two points of view, being (i) as woman in the archetype and (2) as the mystery of sex. Speaking essentially, these two are reducible to one. But the male is not without the female, nor is the woman apart from the man in respect of this mystery, which includes all. It is that of God in His concealment, of God also as He is manifested in the Secret Doctrine, and of prototypical humanity. It is the mystery of the traditional fall of man and of all the banishments which the elect are postulated as having suffered ; but as it is owing to this mystery that each one of us is incarnate here so is it also through this that we return homeward into the refuge whose name is Shekinah ; it is with us at this day in the bondage of our mortality, but it is also the law of our liberation. The Zoharic legend of the Earthly Paradise may be held to formulate the mystery, but it does not expound it. The Paradise above is called &quot; the Sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have estab lished.&quot; 2 The Paradise below has the Holy of Holies for its image and both are at the centre of the earth, called Zion and Jerusalem the place and house of peace. 3 As regards the making of man we know 1 According to Franck, Paradise is always termed by the Kabalists either fijj p = the Garden of Eden or &on D^15J = the World to Come and never D*nB=*/*w#kr= :: Garden) this being the word of the modern Kaba lists.

According to the Elohistic text man was made in the likeness of the Elohim that is to say, male and female for which reason we shall see that Shekinah whose title is Elohim is now male, and female at another time. In so far as she represents the mystery of sex, it is obvious that she is of both sexes, or male on the right side of the Tree of Life which is the masculine side and female on the left side. But the myth of the Earthly Paradise is a Jehovistic text, and by its hypothesis Adam, being the male in distinction from the female, or having the female latent within him, was made in the first place. Now, it is said that when the Holy One created Adam He exhorted him to walk in the way of goodness and revealed to him the Mystery of Wisdom, by aid of which he could attain even to the supreme degree. 1 He also gave him the Law and taught him His ways. 2 This is not, however, Adam in distinc tion from Eve but refers to humanity in its two primor dial forms : so also in respect of what follows. Man was crowned with celestial crowns and was so endowed that he could rule over the six directions of space ; he was perfect in all things and bore the seal of the heights on his countenance. The angels encompassed him and honoured him, revealing mysteries relating to the know ledge of their Master. But he on his part beheld all supreme mysteries and all wisdom exceeding, as we have seen already, the science of the angels and he knew the glory of God. The intention was that he should remain united in heart and mind to Him Who and planted by the Holy One, that He might have joy with the souls of the just who dwell therein ; but the Garden which is planted in the tran scendence, under the Wings of Shekinah, is the place of contemplation for souls in the sweetness of the Lord, and herein is the Blessed Vision.

The unreason is of course to treat a pure myth as if it were literal history. By so much, however, as we elect to exalt the state of man in Paradise, by so much our construction crucifies further the story with which it professes to deal. 2 In respect of the Garden itself, we learn that the whole world is watered by that mysterious river which went forth out of Eden meaning the Paradise that is above. 3 It came from a secret place on high, and brought life to things below. 4 This place is symbolised by the 1 Z., Ft.

It is said also that God encompassed Adam with glory from on high (ib.}, meaning the resplendent vesture or vehicle in which he was manifested before he was clothed with skins as one consequence of his fall. 2 We are told in Gen. ii, 15 that &quot;the Lord God took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.&quot; With this it is interesting to contrast the Zoharic ideas of those duties which fell to Adam in his original state of radiance. He was set to offer sacrifices in the Garden, and for this purpose an altar is postulated therein, which he profaned by his fall, and so became a tiller of the ground. Z., Pt. I, fol. 57b ; DE PAULY, I, 331. It is said in another place that he was set to grow roses. These things occurred by the hypothesis before the institu tion of blood offerings ; we can infer therefore that the sacrifices of Adam were offerings of aspiration, and I think that what is indicated is part of the mystery of union. We shall see otherwise the kind of altar that was profaned by the fall ; it is simply another variant of the mystery of woman hood that Garden which man was given to cultivate. Ib., Pt.

The river brings sanctity from on high ; and when the Kingdom of Heaven shall have come under the form of first-fruits of the earth, the latter will be raised and made equal with Heaven. One might call this a keynote for the whole doctrine of cosmology, except that a keynote of one or another kind seems to transpire everywhere. Holiness is life, and the world subsists by holiness. If this, its correspondences and analogues, were not the beginning, middle and end of Zoharic theosophy, I should have no cause to write about it, because it would not belong to the Secret Doctrine of God, which is my concern in the old litera tures. As regards the formation of Eve from the side of Adam, we meet in the Zohar with another presentation of a tradition which is found in many places of legend. 1 Adam and Eve were joined side by side originally. The explanation which is given in one place only, or perhaps I should say rather that there is no alternative is after the most inscrutable manner of the text i.e., that they were not face to face because as yet &quot;the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth.&quot; 2 This is on the authority of Rabbi Simeon, who forgot, as one might think, for a moment that the same verse adds: &quot;And there was not a man to till the ground.&quot; Too much attention must not be given to inconsistencies of this kind whether or not some means of escape happens to be found subsequently as the purpose of the Zohar is always to make known a point of its Secret Doctrine which can be hooked on to a text, and the context for 1 7., Pt.

It is obvious that a spiritual mystery is here indicated, and one that is part of the intercourse which constitutes the transcen dental unions. The physical basis is of course that the sex-union of humanity takes place in an opposite position to that of all the animals, which was certain to suggest deep symbolism to the Zoharic doctors, though they do not make the contrast. Another intimation is that in their original state not only was Adam made male and female but so also was the woman attached to his side. 3 I suppose that this notion is the antechamber or threshold of that &quot;supreme mystery * which is believed to be expressed in the words : &quot; Male and female created He them.&quot; 4 It is said to constitute the glory of God and to be the object of faith. In the root-nature it is regarded as inaccessible to human reason, perhaps in the sense that it has not entered into the heart of man to understand what God has prepared for those who love Him, or, from another standpoint, it is a matter of experience and not of dissertation. By this mystery was man created as well as the heaven and the earth. It is inferred that every figure which does not represent male and female has no likeness to the heavenly figure. 5 We shall see in 1 As a matter of fact, the discrepancy is recognised speedily, and the same master of doctrine explains that there was no man because Eve had not yet been created, and man was as if non-existent because he was incomplete in her absence. The last point is not a subtlety of the moment, but a doctrine which obtains everywhere regarding our human nature. Z., Pt.

Eve was joined to Adam until he was put to sleep, 2 and here the text dwells especially on the fact that the place of his entrancement was that place where the Temple was built subsequently. 3 As regards the formation of Eve, it is said that &quot; He took one of his ribs,&quot; and here the Zohar develops a great subtlety, inferring that the second pronoun alludes, like the first, to Jehovah Elohim. It says, further, that the plural &quot;ribs&quot; signify the virgins of Matrona, meaning her maids of honour, one of whom was taken to be the &quot; help meet &quot; for Adam. 4 However this story is for gotten soon afterwards and yet others are substituted, but I do not think that we need attach importance to any.

The Pauline consciousness that all Nature groaneth and travaileth, the sense of suffering in all animate beings had never entered therein, though there was a very keen sense of the burdens on election in Israel. It is admitted quite freely, and indeed the notion is implied in several places, that the Holy One has created both the just and the unjust, 2 or still more plainly that He formed man of a spirit of good and a spirit of evil. The exoneration resides in the fact that evil is of service to good, because good turns evil to account. 3 Moreover, God created that Tree the eating of which meant that the full understanding of the evil side of things entered into the life of humanity ; but the saving clause is that it imparted also the knowledge of good. There can be no question and we have seen already that from this point of view the Tree of the Trespass is a synonym or image of the Written Law, for this is prohibition above all things, which defines evil and separates that which is so imputed from what is recognised as good It is understood, however, that the definition is on the formal side and stands therein at its value, without reference to essentials. 4 1 We have seen that there is also no difficulty in the Sepher Yetzirah on the subject, and it is this primitive text which is responsible for Sephirotic theology throughout the Zohar proper.

If the last lives in purity, the first acquires an ascendency over the second, so that both combine to protect him in all his ways. /., fol. i65b ; II, 250. The Spirit of Evil is in a state of incompleteness unless man nourishes him by sin. /#., fol. 2Oia ; II, 398. Apparently, those who thus nourish their master are maintained in turn by him, whence the happiness and prosperity of the Gentiles is a fruit of the union between Samael and his prostituted wife. Ib. t Pt. II, iia; III, 47. It is admitted, on the other hand, that evil is stronger than good. /^., Pt. Ill, fol. 2&3b ; VI, 24.

As to these there is no difficulty: it is only among those who regard it as in some sense a veil of man s spiritual history that the problems offered by this myth are of real consequence, and it is these naturally who have expended their skill in seeking to construct it rationally. Very few have done otherwise than distort the materials placed in their hands, so that if it is hard to be satisfied with the plain story, it is impossible to accept the attempts by which the literal body has been buried, so that it might be raised a spiritual body.

I have spent many years among the mystics who have made excursions into this subject and have produced their vari ous versions, &quot; to perplex the sages &quot; and others. The versions stand at their value, and I do not know that there is much to choose between them, from those of St. Augustine to Saint-Martin. Readers who are acquainted with the theses of Jacob Btfhme on the Paradisaical state will remember that Adam, in his system, began to de generate before the specific occasion of his Fall is sup posed to have arisen and, as part of his declension, that a state of inactivity supervened. 2 One consequence was that Eve had to be removed from within him and mani fested in a state of separation. I do not know how this is harmonised with the Lord God s statement that &quot; it is not good that the man should be alone,&quot; 3 nor does it perhaps signify. In any case the provision of a helpmate did not save him, for in the obscure providence of those dealings the woman was the occasion of his literal fall. The Zohar also recognises a gradual degeneration of Adam, 4 because apparently the workings of the beast &quot; more subtle than any &quot; were in process prior to the manifest temptation of Eve.

It appears that the original union of man, male and female, was apart from fleshly sensation, and it was therefore an union in modesty. 3 When Adam said : &quot; This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh &quot; 4 he was seeking to dispose Eve in favour of this inter course, because they were one only. It was out of this that the temptation is represented as having arisen, for immediately after these words of tenderness the spirit of evil awoke, to substitute carnal pleasures for its own profit in place of pure affection. 5 The object was also to sully the sanctity above by defiling man below in the first place. 6 As regards what theology would call the matter of the sin, there is no need to add that the apple is not understood literally.

It is said that when Adam sinned the evil serpent cleaved to him and defiled him, as well as all future generations. 2 The serpent was able to penetrate secretly into man s interior, and Adam submitted to this so that he might know the mysteries of things below. The serpent showed him all the pleasures of the world 3 presumably as Satan took Christ into a high mountain whence He beheld all the Kingdoms. These intimations depend from a thesis which recurs many times in the Zohar. It is testified by the colleagues that the fall of man was one of sin with a woman 4 in the normal sense which attaches to this expression. It is added almost immediately that sexual desires have caused all evils, the correction or modification assigned to which in the course of debate is that in themselves they are good or evil according to the spirit which inspires them. Now, seeing that it is to Eve that sin of a sexual order was first imputed, the question is who instructed or initiated her ? The answer is that the serpent meaning Samael had &quot; criminal relations &quot; with her and injected his defilement into her, 5 Adam not being affected until she communicated in turn to him. 6 She cohabited with Samael, who corrupted her and by whom she became with child, bringing forth Cain. 7 It is obvious that this is in clear contradiction 1 Z., Pt.

The Zohar is content equally to contradict itself, for it affirms in another place that Adam was defiled by the impure spirit before his union with Eve, and the son whom he begot in this state of impurity was from the left side : so was Cain born. But when Adam repented he engendered a son from the right side : so was Abel born. 2 It is of course arbitrary to postulate such repentance between the two nativities rather than before or after. All that we know from the text of Genesis is that at the birth of Cain Eve was of opinion that she had &quot; gotten a man from God.&quot; Another account, on the authority of Rabbi Eleazar, recurs to the earlier thesis, specifying that Cain was begotten from the serpent but that after intercourse with Adam, Eve conceived again, and so brought two sons into the world one of the works of the serpent and one of the works of Adam. The image of Abel was from on high and that of Cain from below. 4 We have not finished, however, with the complications is also of general rabbinical authority otherwise, and is stated by R. Abraham de Seba in his commentary on the Pentateuch. The Midrash Ruth affirms that both Adam and Eve were defiled by the serpent. Finally, it is mentioned categorically in the Paraphrase of Jonathan ben Uziel (Gen. iv, i) that when Adam knew Eve his wife she had conceived already of the angel Samael. Apparently as a r result of the dual inter course, she brought forth Cain, who is said to have resembled the beings who are above, not those who are below.

I suppose that one of these demons was the black Lilith and the other Naamah, who are both mentioned in the Zohar, though not actually in this connection. We shall see shortly that Lilith was the wife of Adam in Paradise. Adam remained separated from his wife for one hundred and thirty years, continuing to engender, and so long as he was defiled by the infection of the impure spirit, he had no desire for union with Eve. It returned, however, when he purified himself, and he begot &quot;a son in his own likeness, after his image &quot; that is to say, Seth. 4 Dwelling still upon the mystery behind sex, the Zohar generalises on this matter, saying that so long as man follows the path which leads to the left side, his desire is towards the impure only, but the just who 1 Z., Pt.

It may be noted here that she is distinct from the &quot; adulterous woman &quot; who was the wife of Samael, as the latter is to be distinguished from Leviathan. Ib., Pt.

The particular mystery of iniquity indicated by the Zohar is peculiar thereto. The patience of God was extended until the evil began to take that form which is described as the spilling of blood vainly on the earth. 1 The sex aberration here designated will be understood by the expression used. It is the crime attributed to Onan, and the Zoharic doctrine affirms that no man who is sullied in this manner shall enter the heavenly palace nor behold the face of Shekinah. 2 The Shekinah is driven away thereby, and because of its prevalence the world fell into corruption, in part through the sin itself and for the rest by the absence of Shekinah. It was as if the principle of life had been withdrawn or that the loss of the head caused the body to decay.

The reason is found in the words : &quot; For thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.&quot; But Elohim is the celestial Bride, who is Shekinah, and it was by her permission, as Bride, Wife and Mistress of the house, that he had a license to leave the Ark when the Deluge was over. After leaving those hospitable quarters, Noah made a present to the lady of the house, but it reached her by the mediation of her spouse, because Scripture tells us that it was to Jehovah and not to Elohim that Noah erected an altar and offered sacrifice thereon. It was direct, however, from the lady of the house that Noah received his reward, because it is said that Elohim blessed Noah and his children, saying: &quot;Increase and multiply and fill the earth.&quot; 3 It follows, as we shall see otherwise, that Shekinah presides over the fruit of nuptials, as well as over the nuptials themselves. In respect of the altar itself, it may be remembered that the Zohar has occasional references to an offering made by Adam and to that on which he sacrificed. The Deluge either destroyed or overturned everything, and when the time came for Noah to sacrifice on his part he is sup posed to have raised up for this purpose the overthrown altar of Adam. 4 We see that his sacrifice is connected, though obscurely enough, with that mystery of sex which is the subject of allusion throughout. This would seem to be the case with every kind of burnt-offering, and it is even said that Leviticus i, 17, should be translated to signify that the holocaust is a woman and as such an agreeable odour to God. 5 The Authorised Version 1 Z., Pt.

It is admitted also that the word translated burnt is correct according to the literal sense, but if this were its true meaning it is argued that the orthography would have been different. The real purpose of the holocaust was the union of the male and female principles, as these should never be in separation. Noah offered a sacrifice because he represented the male principle which the Holy One united to the Ark, the latter representing the female principle. 1 There are two other points which may be mentioned for the sake of completeness, and the first of these is that the Holy Land was not covered by the waters of the Deluge. 2 An authority is found in the words : &quot; Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.&quot; ; The second is that the Deluge came to be called the waters of Noah, because he prayed for himself only and not for the world. I believe that this idea attaches to a Talmudic story, for there is no indication in Genesis of especial prayer on the part of Noah. The thesis is, however, that, had he chosen, he could have prevailed with God to spare the whole creation. 4 We know from Genesis that Noah planted a vine yard, and according to one Zoharic opinion he trans planted the vine which had grown in the Garden of Eden, but whether this signifies the Tree of Knowledge does not transpire except by inference from the legends. sense of Scripture by substituting other vowel-points. But the question for us is whether it succeeds in conveying its own designed intimation.

The fact that Noah pressed the grapes as Eve is said also to have done par took of the juice and so became drunken, is held to contain a mystery of wisdom. 1 We have seen that ex hypothesi the lady of all our race was making an experiment of know ledge, and we shall understand further that what followed was an intoxication after its own kind. So also Noah was concerned with an experiment, having set himseli to fathom that sin which had caused the fall of the first man. His intention was to find a cure for the world, &quot;in place of Eve and her poison&quot;; 2 but he became drunken by laying bare the Divine Essence without having the intellectual strength to fathom it. This is why Scripture says that he was drunken and was un covered within his tent. The meaning is that he raised a corner of the veil concerning that breach of the world which ought always to remain secret. The physical symbolism is obvious in this place. Moreover, the tent of Noah was really the tent of the vine. 3 I do not pretend that the last sentences are intelligible from any point of view, nor that the materials as a whole of this section convey anything of especial importance, beyond the postulated experiment made by Noah for the purpose of restoring the mystery of sex to its proper place in the spiritual life of man.

I do not think that this is the case, but that it was rather a record of magical art as this was attained by Enos, according to another Zoharic account. 2 It is said that his knowledge and ability in occult science exceeded that of his predecessors from Adam downward, and this is the sense in which we are to understand the scriptural statement that he, Enos, began to &quot; call upon the name of the Lord&quot; 3 that is to say, he used the Divine Name to compel spirits in accordance with the recognised pro cedure of magical operations. The progress of this science ended by assuming such proportions that the wicked generation of the Deluge expected to escape the Divine chastisement by recourse thereto. With the help of its mysteries they prepared even to make war on the Holy One, which was also the intention of those who planned the tower of Babel. 4 Like their predecessors, they had great skill in magic : it was enough for them to pronounce words and things were accomplished.

The first is consecutive, coherent in a certain sense and of great length, but it is not of our especial concern ; the second, on account of its content, is scattered throughout the text and is of prime import ance to the subject of this study. The first may be said to open with an interpretation of the call which came to the patriarch, in answer to which he left &quot;the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees &quot; * and entered into the land of Canaan. The journey was literal no doubt for the doctors in Kabalism and stood as such at its value, but it was also a mystic travelling and in this respect it belongs to a higher currency. Abraham had been endowed with a spirit of wisdom 2 and by the use of its talents had attained a knowledge of the celestial chiefs 3 who govern the various divisions of the habitable world. 4 He had also gone further than this, having dis covered that Palestine was the centre of the earth, and the point of departure in its creation.

This is another sense in which he was to come out of his own country. The words : &quot; Go into a land that I will shew thee &quot; * mean that Abraham was to be occupied henceforth only by those things which God would make known to him, though the essential nature of the Supreme Power which rules the world could not be included in the revelation, being above human understanding. It was therefore a journey in the Divine obedience rather than one of the soul in God ; but this path of conformity is itself a ladder of sanctity, by which man can be united to the Holy One and is indeed the one way of our ascent. Abraham went up this ladder stage by stage 2 until he attained that point which was designed in his case, as it is written : ^And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South&quot; being the Holy Land, wherein he was to reach the highest degree of holiness.

Only as they drew near to Egypt did she raise a corner of her veil, and then he saw that she was fair. 2 In Egypt he found a great centre of the occult arts and again betook himself to their study, but this time he penetrated the secret of evil without being led away thereby.

For once, as it seems to me, the Zohar has exceeded its own measures at this point and has announced a spiritual truth the full purport of which it did not realise.

If at first it was a hygienic observance or one that might act as an aid to continence, it has become in the Secret Tradition a seal of purity, and though it is not expressed it is implied indubitably by the text that it had reference also to the purity of womanhood, because her protection was therein. The proof is that, according to the Zohar, the male side of humanity in its separation from the female had no true title to the name and prerogative of man. There is little need to add that the woman was not without the man, but this is not discussed in the Zohar, for, with all its illuminations and its strong tendencies towards the liberal side, it represents the last development of a purely oriental religion. 1 It remains that while the masculine shares in humanity, it is man only in union with womanhood. When Abraham was circumcised 2 he separated himself from the impure world and entered into the Sacred Covenant, into that covenant on which the world is based ; and seeing that he so entered, it follows that the world is founded on him. Expanding this fantasy, it is sometimes affirmed that Genesis opens with the words : &quot; By Abraham God created, * &c., and therefore the covenant of circumcision is the origin of heaven and earth. 3 The He added to the name of Abram after he had fulfilled the ordinance is said to symbolise the five books of the Law, which are the records at length of the covenant.

It is said also that so long as a man is uncircumcised, he can not unite himself to the Name of the Holy One ; but after circumcision, he enters that name and is joined therewith. 6 Those who do not preserve the sign in purity make separation, in a manner, between Israel and the Heavenly Father. 7 All the forces of Nature centre in the organ of the Covenant, and in the metaphysical principle of the Covenant it is held 8 that there was subsequently hidden and enclosed that light created when God said : &quot; Let there be light&quot; -the alleged reason being that it symbolises the fructifying principle, qui semen injicit famine.

Before they left the presence of the Maker, all souls were conjured to keep the precepts of the Law. 3 While they await incarnation in Paradise they are clothed with bodies and have countenances like those which they are destined to possess hereafter, but these vestures are of course of a psychic or spiritual kind. 4 When the time arrives for embodiment each soul in its turn is called before the Holy One and is told which physical envelope to inhabit. 5 Paradise is a place of blessing, and it may be that &quot; from the gold bar &quot; thereof it has leaned out and seen no reason to descend of its own accord, or to quit present happiness, as it is said, &quot;for bondage and temptation. &quot; It is assured, however, that from the day of its creation it had no other mission than to come into this world. 6 It submits therefore and is stripped of the paradisaical body, that it may be clothed with that of earth.

They descend also together, but they come into the charge of an angel who presides over the pregnancy of women and they are then separated. 4 Sometimes the male soul animates a man first, sometimes the reverse. 5 When the time of marriage comes, the Holy One unites them as before and proclaims their union.

I have now given the general thesis, supplemented by counter-theses, but it should be realised that it is drawn from several places. Among questions which must be left open when the text is collated at large there is that which locates the soul prior to incarnation in the Paradise below, as I have said. Other accounts substitute the superior Eden 3 and according to one of these the descent for a period into the Earthly Garden takes place just prior to incarnation. The time is thirty days. 4 One of the alternatives has no explicit concern with either Paradise but affirms that from an epoch which preceded the creation of the world all souls have been in the presence of the Holy One and there remain till they are called to go down on earth. 5 According to tradition all emanate 1 As the Zoharic considerations on the subject of sister-souls, who have been, so to speak, mismarried, bear ample witness. 2 Z., Pt.

Speaking for the majority of cases, there is some trouble in effecting a harmonious junction between the soul and its earthly envelope 3 ; it is not definitely established therein until after thirty-three days, and for the first seven it goes in and out continuously. One reason seems to be that circumcision, in the Zohar, does not take place till the thirtieth day and that for three days thereafter the body is in a state of suffering. 4 These reveries are tortured out of two texts : &quot; She shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days,&quot; 5 which is of course a reference to the purification of women after childbirth ; and : &quot; It shall be seven days under the dam,&quot; 6 which is a reference to the birth of animals bullocks, sheep, or goats. The &quot; blood of her purification &quot; is in some obscure way the blood of circumcision. 7 Hereof is the Zohar in one of its exegetical moods ; but these things are weariness, and I will conclude there fore on pre-existence with one further reference.

One would say that these souls were the thoughts of God dwelling in divine men, but if we reflect upon the subject, we shall, I think, see that the Zoharic hypothesis really comes to this ; that the soul- world is a world of thought in God ; that the thought precedes the Word, as it is shewn to have done in respect of creation generally ; and that souls are uttered forth continually, passing ultimately into expression in flesh. Though it is closely connected with pre-existence, the mode followed in the generation or creation of souls is hypothetically at least independent and there are import ant reasons why it should be postponed for consideration till I treat of the mystery of sex in Zoharic theosophy. I proceed therefore to the parts or divisions of the soul. It is taught in a summary way that man is composed of three things : 3 Life, or Nephesh ; Spirit, which is Ruah or Ha id ; and Soul, that is, Neshamah. By this he be comes &quot; a living spirit&quot; a term, however, which is applied more especially to Neshamah. They are called also three degrees, or vital spirit, intellectual spirit and soul proper. 4 Nephesh is the fallible part, for sin is sug gested neither by Ruah nor Neshamah.* It is said else where and more plainly that the vital spirit sins, but not the soul. The three degrees are superposed one upon 1 Z., Pt. I, fol. ia ; DE PAULY, I, 5. 2 Song of Solomon ii, 12. 3 Z., Pt. I, fol. 2;a ; I, 169. The &quot;living spirit&quot; is said to proceed from the mouth of Shekinah, who is called &quot;living soul.&quot; Here is another aspect of souls being uttered forth by the Divine, and seeing that this is the Shekinah in transcendence, who is (a) the Third Hypostasis and (b) the M other = Aima in the Supernal Sephira Binah, we shall understand the kind of union which subsists between her and the Father, who is Abba in Chokwah. There is the Divine Thought in Kcther : it is formulated as if mentally in Chokniah : and it is uttered in Binah, producing the living intelligences, who are therefore begotten into the higher Paradise. 4 Il&amp;gt;., Pt.

It is said that some persons are judged worthy to possess a Neshamah, others a Ruah only, while yet others have a Nephesh and nothing more. 4 These last, by reason of their deficiency, are attached to the impure spirit. 5 The Nephesh alone is imprescriptible, or necessary to the man s existence. 6 If he comports himself worthily with this gift another spirit is poured into him, which is like a crown of Nephesh, and this is Ruah. The man is then illuminated by light from a superior region and is in a position to discern the laws of the Sacred King. If he still continues worthy he receives the crown of Ruah, the name of which is Neshamah, but it is called also Soul of God. Now, it seems obvious that it is this only of which pre-existence, paradisaical life and the Divine Vision can be predicated, and the point is therefore that con trary to the very clear doctrine concerning the descent of sou-Is Neshamah does not come down and incarnate in every human being. 7 It seems in this case to be mere fantasy with which we have been dealing previously. 1 Z.,Pt.II,fol.2o6a;DEPAULY, 11,425. i /.,Pt.III,fol.25a; ,64. 3 lb., Pt.

The spirit of light and the intellectual spirit dwell together and depend one upon the other, but the soul is independent of both. Another thesis is that when man proposes to live in purity heaven comes to his aid, grant ing him the holy soul, by which he is purified and sancti fied ; but if he be unworthy and will not live in purity, he is animated only by Nephesh and Ruah. It is obvious that this fails to concur with the earlier statement, which represents Ruah as a gift to be earned, but we can read between the lines of contradiction and conclude that the real intention is to represent the permanent part of man as descending and overshading the personality, when this * is born into the world ; it draws nearer with his growth and improvement ; and it may be, so to speak, incor porated with him, or it may not. Understood thus, the speculation will stand at its value : it is a primitive crudity of materialism, but the Zohar sometimes exceeds such notions and ascends into a clearer region. Before giving two or three casual examples, I will cite another classification because of the extraordinary conse- m the text, though I do not propose to consider it, as the multiplication ol aspects beyond what is actually needed must tend only to the reader s confusion. I have registered the fact for the use of those who would carry their research further.

Nephesh is presumably of the earth earthy, for it is said to remain in the tomb 4 but any statement seems to serve which is made on the spur of the moment ; Ruah enters the Earthly Paradise, where the High Priest Michael offers it as a holocaust to the Holy One and it remains in the joy of Paradise ; 5 Nesh amah ascends on high. 6 What purpose has been attained by its experience below does not appear in the text ; if it cannot sin, it is not in search of merit. There is no need to add that here again this version of the tripartite personality, postulating independent survival in three separate directions for Nephesh is alive in the tomb cannot be reconciled with the alternatives that have gone before. I conclude that the Secret Doctrine in Israel was unsettled on the subject of the soul and its divisions, that there is no guide for the perplexed therein, and that we shall come in the end to recognise only one secret doctrine in Jewry, which is the secret concerning sex. Among several intimations which are better than formal attempts to classify there is one which says that 1 Z., Pt.

It was held to extend through the body, to be rational and self-subsisting, but its mode of comprehension was by inter mediaries and not direct.

Late Kabalism said that Yehidah is individuality the unity or correspondence by which man becomes like unto his First Cause.

It appears to be a sacred soul issuing from the Tree of Life, and it is adapted to the works of the recipient.

They are consoled by Messiah, who brings them into the fourth palace, where are the souls of all those who have shared the sorrow of Zion and those also who have been slain by the heathens. The fifth palace is the sojourn of true penitents who have restored their souls to a state of purity, and of those who have sanctified the Name of their Master by going to meet death for His glory. 2 There also are the souls of those who have repented on their death-beds, for the Doctors of Kabalism insist no less on the possibility of saving the situation of life thus at the last moment than do the doctors of the Latin church : for the one and the other the great fatality resides in final impenitence. The sixth palace is the sojourn of the souls of Zelatorcs who have pro claimed the Master s unity, and have loved Him with a true love. 3 The seventh palace is that which I have called superior in respect of the rest ; it is also more secret and mysterious.

But the Zohar is really concerned only with enforcing the idea of ascent in the scale hereafter, and the logic of its fiction is of no consequence in comparison witfi the main object. It is therefore idle to rectify on our part ; let us realise rather that the Zohar is establishing another point of correspondence between the lesser and greater world. We have seen how early in the Christian centuries it has forestalled the modern doctrine of macrocosmic evolution and this now is a story of evolution in the microcosm, working on the basis of six periods corre sponding to those of creation ; while as the latter was followed by a period of rest, so is the seventh palace a place of the secrecy and mystery suggesting a Sabbatic state. But above it there is the other and ineffable order of the supernal palaces, and beyond the present epoch in created things there is the Messianic age to come, in which the story of the world and man reaches its end for Zoharic theosophy, as it does in the Apocalypse. The idea of reincarnation in Kabalism has been the subject of much confusion in the modern occult schools, which have depended, firstly, on the vague and incor rect vestige of elucidation offered by Adolphe Franck * 1 La Kabbale, pp. 244-247. There is postulated in the first place the fact of metempsychosis in Kabalism on the authority of Z., Pt. II,fol.99b, and afterwards the author gives a very imperfect account of the Zoharic doctrine concerning overshadowing, impingement, or embryonic states of souls, with which I am proceeding to deal. 167"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The Secret Die trine in Israel and, secondly, on the obvious misstatements of Eliphas Leva. 1 It is dismissed by the one in a few paragraphs and the other states that the doctors of traditional science in Israel did not admit the subject. On the contrary, there is a very clear system of reincarnation scattered throughout the Zohar. To some extent the doctrine hinges on questions of paternity, for it is stated very plainly that when a man has failed to have children in this world, the Holy One will send him back, and many times at need, to fulfil what has been neglected, so that he is compared to a plant which is continually removed from the ground and located elsewhere in the hope that it will do better. 2 Reincarnation is not, however, an universal law, or at least it is contingent on other cases than the particular case which has been just specified. Those who have accomplished their mission during a single sojourn on earth rest near to the Holy One ; those who return are those who have not finished their work, whether it be that of parentage or otherwise. 3 It is rather obvious that the perfect fulfilment of the Law was a matter of great difficulty, and we know that St. Paul regarded it as an intolerable burden ; we know also that failure in certain points voided the entire fulfilment; and the inference would seem to be that reincarnation for the doing of that which had been previously left undone arid for the undoing of that which was amiss formerly must, by the hypothesis, have been the rule rather than the exception.

In order that the significance of the expression should not remain doubtful, it is added that the Holy One will some day ransom the world and will grant the spirit in question to men generally, so that they may live eternally. 1 This is said to be shewn by the words : &quot; For as the days of a tree are the days of my people,&quot; 2 and also : &quot; He will swallow up death in victory : and the Lord God will wipe away all tears from off all faces ; and the rebuke of His people shall He take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.&quot; 3 Reincarnation or transmigration would seem also to be the invariable fate of the Gentiles ; I do not know what happens to those who die in whatever land they belong to, but there is no reason to suppose that they are better off in this respect than the souls of Pagans who deliver up their bodies in the Holy Land. 4 Of these it is said that they are not received in heaven, that they wander about in the universe, transmigrate many times and finally return to the unclean place whence they came. The souls of Israel which leave the body outside Palestine have also transmigrations and wanderings before reaching the region assigned them. 5 If this is to be taken as definite and 1 do not think that the view is revised subsequently one side of the law of reincarnation depends upon a merely external accident. It will be useful to remark here that the Zohar knows nothing concerning spaces of time intervening between death and rebirth ; the question does not seem to have arisen within their consciousness ; the period elapsing may have been variable, as it is regarded in Eastern doctrine ; but it is sometimes at least immediate.

It is said further that Phineas received the soul of Nadab and Abihu, who were alive at the time. 3 Rabbi Simeon testifies that this is a mystery, meaning that their soul did not find refuge under the wings of Shekinah, because they left no children and had thus diminished the figure of the King. The King here is presumably the Adam Protoplastes of late Kabalism, corresponding to the Lesser Countenance. I have spoken already of the place whatever it is, for it is indeed described variously in which souls are reserved, awaiting the period of their primary embodiment in flesh ; I have mentioned also the notion that at the Messianic period the fount of souls will be exhausted, leading to the creation of entirely new cohorts. 4 But it is said also that there will come a time when old souls, meaning souls in migration, will be renewed for the renewal of the world. 5 Each of these souls which have been incarnated previously will be united to a new created soul, as it is written : &quot; And it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jeru salem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem. * We see by these extracts that reincarnation according to Kabalism is complicated by several considerations and that the word impingement or overshadowing would be a better de scription of that which occurred in certain cases.

The testimony of Isaac de Loria in his Book of the Revolutions of Souls is an instance of the lengths to which the subject could be carried and I shall have to deal with it at a later stage. 1 The question of resurrection in connection with re incarnation created difficulties of its own. It was alleged that in the case of souls who take flesh several times the body which shall rise will be that in which the soul has succeeded in taking root, meaning presumably that it has fulfilled the Law in perfection. 2 Those bodies in which the soul fails to reach its ends are like dried up trees which fall to dust, and they will rise no more. There is some subtlety in this as a way out of the difficulty created by the idea of resurrection in connection with the idea of rebirth. But it will be observed that nothing is said as to those who have been rooted only in wickedness. I may add that the Zoharic doctrine of the world to come and the recompenses and punishments therein is quite independent of any reincarnation hypothesis and cannot be adjusted thereto. The two ideas were developed almost certainly in complete independence of e.ach other. As regards resurrection, there is a variant of the above view, according to which the soul will return into the last body that was animated, but the previous bodies will rise also and will be animated with new souls. &quot; If these bodies have fulfilled meritorious works &quot; I give the literal words in this instance &quot;they will continue, but if not they will return again to dust,&quot; and as no purpose will have been served, this reverie does not seem less than imbecile. 3 Some incidental points may be summarised as follows.

This implies that the axiom once an Israelite always an Israelite obtains automatically, and though I have not had occasion to mention it previously, it may be said now that what may be called the primordial generation of the chosen people insures this supposing that rebirth occurs. There is another point : reincarnation is good because good reasons are, by the hypothesis, behind it, but as it is not good in itself it is well to be spared therefrom. In conclusion, rebirth befalls those who do not study the Law, the inference being that those who do and who at the same time fulfil the other precepts do not suffer transmigration. 4 1 Z., Pt.

It seems to me that the Doctors testified very often with the unmeasured words of enthusiasm and that the emotion of the moment gave the inward meaning to the written word much more frequently than any abstruse law of interpretation. I will speak first of that which is held to occur at the time of death and then of punishment in Sheol, with special reference to its duration. Many things which are hidden from the mind and heart of man so long as the body is in health are beheld by the soul when it is hovering between life and death. 1 Three messengers descend who begin to count up the days that he has lived, the sins that he has committed, and all the works which he has accomplished here below. 1 Z., Pt.

On quitting this lower world the man gives account to his Master on the basis of the record which has been mentioned. Having crossed the threshold, he recognises many persons whom he knew on earth. As we have seen otherwise, he also beholds Adam seated before the Garden of Eden, so that he may rejoice with those who have observed the commands of their Master. Adam is ever encompassed with a multitude of the just, who have learned how to avoid the path going down to hell and who have been gathered into the abode of Paradise. 2 Another account says that when the soul leaves this world, it is stopped by a number of angels who preside over the offices of severity, and is prevented from pass ing through that door by which it would attain a place on high if the person has left no pledge on earth, mean ing no son. 3 Those who would enjoy the inheritance of God and be united with Him for ever in the land of life must have produced male issue, so that the Divine Law may continue to have its servants through all generations. 4 1 The thesis is that sins are committed while spirit is united to body, and the account rrjust be taken therefore before their separation is com pleted.

They are all plunged in sadness. Relations and friends accompany the soul into the other world and shew him the place of his reward or punishment. This is one side of the story 6 but another is that when the souls of those who have studied the Doctrine relinquish the body which is composed of the four elements they ascend into heaven or into that part and that they might inherit the earth but that the Law might prevail therein. The production of children was therefore for the glory of God. It was a continuous building of houses not made with hands which might become meet for His habitation.

There is a very true sense further more in which it may be said that out of this mystery all Kabalism seems to issue and, moreover, goes back therein.

In this union abides the Mystery of Faith, which is the synthesis of the whole Law Written and Oral Law and of all that exists whatsoever.

The same vibrations which are mentioned in the case of Metatron constitute the beatitude of the soul in heaven. There are two points which should be memorised on this subject. At the apex of the union between male and female which is to be understood only in a spiritual sense the sex distinction has ceased : it is only from this point of view that the Shekinah is mentioned sometimes as if she were on the male side. Here is the first point, and the second is that in characteristics and in mission, she is always typically female ; it is she who comprises all women in her mystery, 5 and this is why as we shall see she does not abide except with him who is united to a woman. 6 We have next to consider her relation to the letters of Tetragrammaton.

The tabernacle was erected to serve as her residence ; and at the moment when it was set up by Moses, there was another erected in the world above. What seems to have happened, however, was that the Mosaic tabernacle became the residence of Metatron, who connects so curiously with Shekinah. 3 The latter was also that cloud which abode on the tent of the congregation while the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. 4 Alternatively it was a cloud that rose up to veil her presence, and dis solved when she went forth. It is called smoke by the Zohar, which also gives the reason, according to its own fantastic symbolism namely, that the Shekinah had been drawn into this world by the fire which burns in the hearts of the patriarchs. 5 The male principle or Jehovah is said also to have spoken from the tabernacle by the intermediation of Shekinah, who is the female principle. 6 The tabernacle itself as we have seen is the Shekinah under another aspect, 7 much as the tent of Sarah is so called on occasion, because she and the Divine Bride dwelt therein. 8 The Shekinah considered as the tabernacle is in pledge for the sins of man. 9 1 Z., Pt.

The Mishna is the servant of Shekinah 2 and is also that helpmeet for man which is promised in Scripture. 3 Whether this interpretation could be elucidated by explaining in what sense the Mishna as part of the story of Israel may be said to have tempted men, understood as those who are elect or are at least capable of election, and may have led them into the exile of the fall, is another question ; but the tour de force is not attempted in the Zohar. It might be affirmed truly that it took them further and further into the bondage of the letter. The text itself says only that the Mishna was the spouse of Israel during his adolescence, 4 spouse also during his exile, though sometimes for and sometimes against him. The marriage was imperfect at best. During the adolescent period the Mishna was pre-eminent over Matrona, so that the King and Matrona were separated from the celestial spouse. 5 It was the servant who took the place of the mistress.

The answer, according to the Zohar, is that the Oral Law is the image of Elohim, and this we know to be Shekinah. 1 There is one practical application of all this cloud of doctrine, and it may be summarised in a few words. It is prayer that attaches man to Shekinah, and as the Holy One is united constantly to her, it follows that by prayer man is attached to the Holy One. 2 All the angels open their wings to receive the Shekinah by prayer* and those on earth who wish their prayers to reach heaven should unite themselves with the Shekinah. 3 Whereas the gates of the palaces to which prayers ascend commonly have numerous guardians, those of the palace of Shekinah have none, and prayers enter unhindered. 4 It will seem at first sight that she occupies in Kabalism the same position of intercessor which is ascribed to the Blessed Virgin by the devotion of the Latin Church, yet having regard to Shekinah s incorporation with the Divine Hypostases, I incline to think that the analogy is misleading. In view of all that has been done to Christianise Kabalism by every good means, and by so many that are bad intellectually, one has to be very careful of reading Christian implicits into the text of the literature. 5 There is a question whether my next and last point of analysis had better be taken here or in a later chapter ; but as I have mentioned Christian implicits, and as what I have to say seems to connect with this subject, I will incorporate it under that motive, though it has also other issues.

They forget, however, that neither in the East nor the West under the aegis of the Greek or Roman Orthodoxy is the Son held to proceed from the Father and the Spirit, but on the contrary that the last is postulated as proceeding from the Father and the Son. Albeit the Filioque clause of the Nicene creed^ was a ground of division between the two branches of the Church Catholic, as not of apostolical authority, I have heard that it is not denied otherwise in the Greek Rite. One alternative would be the co-equal and co- eternal procession of the Son and the Spirit from the Divine Father, and the symbol in this case would be a triangle with the apex upward, not in the reverse position which characterises Latin theology. Now it cannot be said that either doctrinal position represents the mind of Kabalism. We have seen that Jehovah Elohim, Spouse and Bride, Father and Mother, God and His Shekinah are in Kcther in a state of oneness, without separation, if not without distinction. There are very few references to this state in the Zohar. I have intimated indeed that there is only one which can be quoted with complete certainty in the wording, but I am justified thereby in saying that it is a state corresponding to that of parentage. They reproduce themselves immediately 1 I have said that it arises naturally, but I do not mean that we should do much in this manner to complete the Christian Triad in Kabalism. Readers who have followed my study up to this point will find little o-round for comparison between those who dwell in the Sephirotic Supernals and Father, Son and Holy Ghost in the Heaven of St. Thomas Aquinas, or other of the Latin Doctors. 2l6"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"The Mystery of Shekinah below as Abba and Alma, referred to Kether and Chokmah. But as in the Supernals there is no distinction between Shekinah and the Holy One, so the male and female in these Sephiroth are one with those which are in Kether. It follows that Shekinah is on both sides of the Tree, as I have said elsewhere in this book, and it is difficult to postulate in such a triad either a time conception or passage from subject to object. But the Trinity was working towards manifestation, and the result was that Abba and Alma begot the Son, who is Van in Daath, from which His personality was extended through all the lower Sephiroth. They begot also the Daughter and Bride, at first implied in the Son, but afterwards separated and extended with him through the three worlds below Atziluth. Later Kabalism locates the conception of Tod in Chokmah, excogitated as King and Father ; He in Elnah, as Queen and Mother ; Van posited in the Six Briatic and Yetziratic Sephiroth from Chesed to Tesod inclusive, but enthroned especially as the Son in Tip- hereth ; while the He final is in Malkuth. The descent of the second He being into Malkuth, the two schemes concur, and have been followed in my special diagram. It must be recognised otherwise that two separate arrange ments of the Tree seem implied in the Zohar. There is that which I have followed, drawing largely from The Book of Mystery and the three Idras, and there is its alternative which can be extracted not without some confusion from other parts of the collection. According to this the Father and Mother are in Kether, the Son who is the Word is in Chokmah, the Daughter and Bride is in Binah. Now the Divine Name attributed to Kether is Jah, formed of Jod and He final belonging to the Tetragam. It is said to be the Unknown God for whom the Name in question is that which the propitiatory was for the Tabernacle a summary of the male world above and the female world below. It is the Name of the Ancient of Ancients ; it is the synthesis of all things 217"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine in Israel above and below. It follows in the arrangement that the Vau is referable to Chokmah and the He final to Binah, who descended to Malkuth, as the Bride or Shekinah in manifestation. Shekinah is really in every part as well as on both sides of the Tree, being the mistress of the height and the deep, president over the four quarters of the universe of created things and all that led up thereto. Now the editor and translator of the Zohar have an arrangement peculiar to themselves, by virtue of which Tod or the male principle, understood as the Father, is allocated to Kether ; He, understood as Shekinah, is in Chokmah ; while Vau in Einah is the Holy Spirit. The Christian Trinity is thus complete, though the question of procession is left to account for itself as it may. The attribution is part of a scheme for decoding the mystery of Shekinah along a particular line in connection with the Zoharic doctrine respecting Messiah, and it will be considered in full later on. The question which arises here is whether the Shekinah, by us allocated to Binah, is or is not the Holy Spirit. The editor or translator maintain that she is not, and the fact that two opinions are possible on the subject implies that the Zohar is either not at one with itself or utters an uncertain voice. There are many references, and perhaps there is a choice between them. It is manifest in the first place that the Holy Spirit is personified in the Zohar, and a pre liminary point is whether we can find authority for this in the Old Testament. &quot;Take not thy Holy Spirit from me,&quot; 1 says David, and according to Isaiah the people of Israel vexed God s Holy Spirit. 2 He asks also : &quot; Where is He that put His Holy Spirit within him ? &quot; 3 meaning Moses, adding that &quot; The Spirit of the Lord &quot; caused Moses to rest.

They may be kept in mind by the reader in connection with the Zoharic allusions which will follow hereon. He shall decide for himself as I have no wish to adjudicate whether there is more explicit personification in the Kabalistic text, and if so whether it is to be accounted for by (i) natural development of ideas; (2) Jewish tendencies prior to the Talmuds, represented roughly by Philo and, as s_uch, a possible common source for Kabalistic Jew and Christian; (3) Talmudic evidence; or (4) the atmosphere of Christian doctrine in which the Kabalistic Jew lived and moved for the most part and which he can have scarcely failed to absorb in some degree. I will take first of all those references which are either dubious or appear to suggest that the Holy Spirit is not synonymous with Shekinah. The Zohar asks : what is signified by the words : &quot; And the Spirit returns to Elohim who gave it &quot; ? 14 1 Numbers xi, 29. 2 //;., xi, 26. 3 //;., xxvi, 18. 4 Deut. ii, 30. 5 i Chron. xii, 18.

Again, it is said that when man is circumcised he is joined to the sacred crown of Shekinah and the Holy Spirit rests upon him. 2 In another place three spirits are dis tinguished : (i) The Spirit below, which is called the Holy Spirit ; (2) the Spirit of the Middle Way, which is that of Wisdom and Understanding; (3) The Spirit which sounds the trumpet and unites the fire to the water, this being the Superior, Concealed and Mysterious Spirit, whereunto are suspended all sacred spirits and all luminous countenances. 3 Now, it is stated, after the prevailing manner of the Zohar, which cannot postulate a triad apart from an inward unity, that these three are one and that they form a holocaust, which is the Holy of Holies. 4 This, however, is explained elsewhere to be Shekinah, for as we have seen she is the sacrifice which God has placed on His right and His left hand, and about Him. 5 Again, &quot; she is the sacrifice of the Holy One,&quot; and prayer is the holocaust which in turn is offered to her. 6 Once more, it is said that when the Shekinah resided in the Holy Land the impure spirit took flight and found refuge in the abyss, while the Holy Spirit was diffused throughout the world, so that the one would seem to be associated closely with the other, if we can pre sume that there is indeed distinction. 7 In this connection 1 Z., Pt.

They did homage accordingly, and thereafter the Holy Spirit ascended towards the King The three letters, Mem, Shin and He, belonging to the name of Moses, offered their worship also ; and then the Holy Spirit, in fulfilment of what had been foretold, came down to earth, bearing the arms necessary to smite Pharaoh and his entire country. On reaching this world He found the Shekinah already here, radiant of aspect and spreading light through all the house. 1 It will be observed that the last sentence looks like an unqualified and conclusive distinction, though in its absence and from what has preceded in the extract one would have Benjamin would have part in the Holy Land, and (b) that the Shekinah would reside therein. Whether this tends to identification or to the opposite might be difficult to affirm. See ib., Ft. I, fol. 2O2b ; II, 405. 1 Z., Pt. II, fol. 53b, 54a ; DE PAULY, III, 241, 242. 221"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine in Israel said that the Holy Spirit was actually a synonym of Shekinah. We hear nothing more, however, of any office in distinction, for that which henceforward abode with the Lawgiver was not the Holy Spirit but the glory of his Spiritual Spouse, who had been with him from his beginning on earth. Let us now take the evidence in the contrary sense, proceeding in the same manner and remembering that there is only one decisive testimony at most on the nega tive side of the subject. In the first place, it is said as we have seen indeed already that the Holy Spirit inspired Leah concerning her work in connection with the foundation of the twelve tribes; 1 but we know otherwise that it is Shekinah who presides over birth, seeming to be in analogy with the chaste and conjugal Venus. In con nection with the daughter of Jethro who was the father-in-law of Moses the Holy Spirit is affirmed to have been always with Moses, J which we may read in the light of another statement that the Shekinah was associated with the orders which Moses gave to the experts charged with building the Tabernacle, because such work could not be accomplished properly without the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. 3 The association of Shekinah meant the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit. Here again is at least the close connection in virtue of which the one is not without the other, and the kind of nearness is illustrated more clearly by another passage which speaks of that day when God shall pour upon us the Holy Spirit of His Shekinah. 4 It would seem again to be the breath of Shekinah. Once more it is said that the Holy Spirit is called Z0//7, being the name which designates the sign of the 1 Z., Pt. I, fol. i57a ; DE PAULY, II, 216. - //;., Pt.

So also when Balaam lifted up his eyes, 2 he is supposed to have beheld Shekinah resting with poised wings above the twelve tribes of Israel, and to have questioned how he could prevail against them, seeing that the Holy Spirit was thus their stay and their protection. There seems no doubt that this is an equivalent of identification. 3 It is only at the end of the Zohar that we obtain a still more decisive voice on the affirmative side. The question is one of alleged or suggested criminal relations between Esther and Ahasuerus, which are characterised as slander, the Zohar adding that &quot;she was clothed with the Holy Spirit,&quot; 4 as it is written : &quot; Esther put on her royal apparel &quot; or, as the passage renders it, &quot; clothed herself with royalty.&quot; The inter pretation follows immediately thus : &quot; The Holy Spirit this is the Shekinah with which Esther clothed herself.&quot; 5 It is an opportunity for a favourite form of testimony, and the great text adds : &quot; Woe to those who feed Upon the husk of the Law, while the grain of wheat is the mystic sense.&quot; It will be observed that, if words signify anything, this is not less than an unqualified and con clusive identification. If anyone will read over with care similar to my own the references which I have now provided on both sides of the question, I believe that they will conclude with me, as against the one definite statement on the negative side, that there is a cumulative affirmative evidence crowned by a most clear affirmation : &quot; The Holy Spirit this is the Shekinah.&quot; When therefore the editor and translator of the Zohar allocate .this Spirit to Binah, it means that they are referring the Shekinah thereto, as I have done 1 Z., Ft.

But this Spirit is not the Third Person in the Blessed Trinity of Christendom, though it is impossible that it should not have aspects of likeness, in so far as the root of both doctrines is in the Holy Scriptures of Israel. I conclude on the authority of the text itself which for once I must repeat at this point that &quot;from the constant and ardent love of He&quot; in Binah &quot; for Tod&quot; in Chokmah &quot;there issues Vau&quot; in Daath, conceived and born of He, by which also it is nourished. 1 &quot; But Van came into the world with a twin-sister bearing the name of Grace,&quot; which is Chesed because Grace is Mercy. &quot; The two took root on earth and constituted the He final &quot; that is to say, in Malkuth because the male is not without the female as we shall see either above or below. &quot; Thus was the Vau united to the He&quot; final. But in the completion, the perfection and harmony of the Divine Name, letter by letter and letter within letter, all these are one at the root: there would be separation proclaimed in the Divine Nature if Tod, He, Vau, He did not bear witness to His unity. 2 The most important consideration which arises out of the whole subject is after what manner we are to regard essentially this Cohabiting or Indwelling Glory which is termed Shekinah in Scripture and in the sacred texts of the Zohar. We know that it dwelt between the Kerubim in the Tabernacle or Ark of Moses, and the Kerubim are said to have been male and female, types in the Sanctuary of Israel of things manifested on earth as types in their 1 Z., Pt.

When the harmony is taken between all the cloud of references, it calls for no gift of interpretation to discern what lies with uttermost plainness on the surface ; but we have explained nothing which is vital if we say that Shekinah is the principle of Divine Motherhood that is, the feminine side of Divinity, implied in. the logic of our symbolism when we speak of the Fatherhood in God. It is a case of being true to our symbols, and though this is of consequence intellectually, it remains thereat. If we turn to the analogy which subsists in virtue of the symbolism be tween womanhood above and that which is found below, we shall not proceed much further if there is brought home to us merely the notion that the office of the mother on earth is made sacred in a sense that is above the hallowed sense of Nature by the conception of its archetype in heaven. It has been present to us through all the Christian centuries in the popular and most catholic devotion to the Queen of Heaven, which, like so many other popular interests, but those more especi ally that are consecrated by the greatest of all the churches, adumbrates a vital truth in the spiritual life and a first principle in the world of reality. It has been a very sincere and whole-hearted devotion in those who have been drawn thereto ; but the particular doctrine of miraculous and virgin birth, though eloquent and sugges tive within its own measures, creates a clear line of de marcation between subject and object, so that there is a world-wide distinction between the honour paid to her who is ever outside ourselves and the adoration of Him Who is never understood essentially until He is realised within. Now, there are no prayers to Shekinah in the official liturgies of Jewish religion, but in the Secret Church of Israel, frequented in spirit and in truth by the Sons of the Doctrine, she is either the House of Prayer or else abides therein, and we have seen that her doors are open to prayers for ever. She was the 225 p"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine in Israel great object of prayer, though it is to be questioned whether it was by the way of prescribed forms : it was rather by that prayer in the stillness of unexpressed thought about which we hear in the Zohar. The reason is ready to our hands, and the first light which may be said to fall on our subject is that the Shekinah is an indwelling glory. The Latin Kabalists made use of the term cohabitant by an imperfect understanding on their own part of the mystery involved that is to say, by a consideration of the external side which obtains in espousal relations on earth. The proper word is inhabi tant, for it is said that the Shekinah dwells in man, 1 being in the heart of those who seek after good works zealously. 2 And more definitely : Man is the House of the Shekinah. 3 The beginning of this inhabitation is when man makes a firm effort towards self-amendment, for by such turning the Shekinah is drawn towards him, 4 and to this condi tion are applied the words : &quot; I am my beloved s and his desire is towards me.&quot; 5 Those with whom she dwells are those who are humbled and even broken by suffering. 6 Yet does she reign only where there is joy rather than sad ness, an allusion to the support of trials with resignation. The suffering is, however, more especially that of which the root or cause is in love, being the state of those who are consumed by the love of the Divine : these are the Brothers of the Shekinah. 7 Again, it is said that the work of Shekinah below is comparable to that which the soul accomplishes in the body : more accurately still, it is the same work, 8 and this enables us to understand in what sense she is termed the soul of the Tabernacle below, 9 which Tabernacle is the sacred body of man. I have called these intimations a first light, but I have not intended to exaggerate their value as such. I speak 1 Z., Ft. I, fol. i66a ; DE PAULY, II, 250. 2 Ib., Pt. II, fol.

It is idle to decode books of secret doctrine unless they have something more definite to tell us concerning the way, the truth and the life. So also it is beautiful to hear that whosoever wrongs a poor person is guilty of wrong to Shekinah, because she is the protectress of the poor ; 1 but we know too well already of the things which grieve the spirit. I might multiply these quotations, and it would serve no greater purpose ; the question would remain then which remains now ; the Secret Doctrine of Israel either covers a mystery of know ledge wherein there lies possible a mystery of certitude in experience or it is a temple in a waste of thought, far from any city of refuge and filled only with confused rumours or raving of empty words. Now, I have per formed many arid journeys in my time and have returned with an empty wallet ; but if this had been one of them I should not have written its itinerary in the present study of the Zohar. There have been recurring intimations there and here in these pages concerning a mystery of sex ; it is imposed upon me now to affirm that this is the mystery of Shekinah ; and the nature of such mystery corresponds according to its veiled claim with the definition which I have just given concerning a knowledge and an experience. The point and centre of the whole subject is the Indwelling Glory ; it is declared everywhere, but everywhere it is also concealed ; one aspect of its presentation amidst great hiddenness of wording sug gests that the entrance of the High Priest into the Holy 1 Z., Pt.

I will rather resume the conference by saying that, according to the Zohar, the union of male and female is Modesty,- and that the title to behold the face of Shekinah is one of purity. 3 It seems true therefore to say that she is the Law of the Mystery, and the Zohar quotes concerning her, &quot; When thou goest, it shall lead thee ; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee ; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.&quot; 4 The study of this Law is life eternal. 5 Considered as a law, it implies a covenant, and of this covenant Joseph is said to be the image, because of his continence in respect of Potiphar s wife. 6 Having tabulated these premisses and thus secured a point of departure, we have again to ap proach the great text and see after what manner it will shed light on the research. It is specified that the Shekinah dwelt with Israel prior to the captivity, meaning probably the captivity in Babylon, and the sin which brought about this exile was equivalent to the uncovering of the hidden physical centre of Shekinah. I am speaking here under great difficulty and am somewhat exchanging terms, for this Minerva and Diana of Israel is a woman, like Isis, and her veil is not to be lifted. The French translators finish the quotation under notice with the help of the Latin tongue, and it reads : Traditum est . . . genitaks panes Shekin* existere? This also is a sacrament, but we can understand the meaning by assuming that the Shekinah in such a connection signifies the Secret Doctrine in so far as it was a mystery of sex, and the Zohar goes on to particularise the alleged sin as a crime of incest, by which 1 Z., Ft.

It matters nothing to our subject if on the surface of Scripture the accusation seems without warrant ; to justify the hermeneutics of the Zohar would be a task as much beyond my province as beyond my powers of pleading. 1 But we begin to see in this manner the kind of problem that has been taken in hand. It is said farther that the mystery of the Shekinah comprises all women, and this as we have seen is why she does not abide except with him who is united to a woman. 2 She is fixed definitely in the house of man when he marries, ct quum ftfderis suum signum in locum pomt? This is why the He and the Van follow each other in the alphabet Vau being the symbol of the male and He of the female principle. Husband and wife are one, and a ray of celestial grace covers them ; it descends from Chokmah, penetrates the male principle, and the latter communicates it to the female. 4 We can understand therefore in what sense her shame is the defiled body of man, 5 and how she is weighted by the sin of Israel. 6 The reason is that she is a virgin betrothed to the Middle Pillar, 7 and of her it was said by Adam in the great day of his perfection : &quot; This is now r bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh,&quot; s which is to affirm that in one of her aspects she is the type of stainless womanhood ; but she passes ever into espousals below as she is ever in es pousals above for the fulfilment of herself in humanity, 1 As a matter of fact, the idea is drawn from the Talmud, which enumerates various cases of the crime in question, but the reference in the Zohar is to be understood spiritually, as of an assault on Shekinah, who as we have seen is the sister of all men. From all modern points of view and feeling, this kind of symbolism is unfortunate and disconcerting enough ; but I think that the Sons of the Doctrine, if they had been challenged on the subject, would have replied with Gerald Massey that Nature is not ashamed of her emblems. 2 Z., Ft.

The evidence is that when there is a just man on earth the Shekinah cleaves to him and does not leave him henceforth. 1 It will be observed that in order to gain the parti cular point at a given moment the Zohar is valiantly careless of that which goes before, as of that which may be designed to come after. The history of the fall of man through the intermediation of woman, acting under the virus of the serpent, is by no means the history of Shekinah, unless under a special aspect and as a remote reflection ; but when it is sought to shew that she is nearer to the elect than hands and feet are near, it is difficult to find anything more complete in its correspondence than such words as &quot; bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh,&quot; 2 and the use of the text so long as it is apart from the context happens to be a true one, though it is about as literal in its application as is the tale of the Garden of Eden. So also when the Zohar wishes to apply that idea of a &quot; field which the Lord has blessed &quot; 3 to the mystery of sex, it is not above saying that the King who &quot; tills the field &quot; 4 or is u served by the field &quot; is the Shekinah, sex-contradiction notwithstanding. The object is to indicate that the dwelling of the Shekinah in the house of those who are married is to bring about the descent of souls to animate children under her presidency. 5 But perhaps there was never an instance so much to our purpose as the statement that on the day when the Song of Solomon was revealed below, the Shekinah descended 6 as if for the first time, though we know 1 Z., Pt.

It is the summary of Holy Scripture ; it is the work of creation, the mystery of the patriarchs, the exile in Egypt, the exodus of Israel, the Decalogue and manifestation on Sinai, the emblem of all events during the sojourn in the desert, thence to the entrance into the Holy Land and so forward to the building of the Holy Temple.

It is rather vision which is promised to the blessed in the world beyond, to gaze upon the face of Shekinah, 1 as in a substituted state of union, and the title must be earned in this life by the following of the path of purity. 2 It is affirmed in reference to this that those only who quit the lower world in the grace of the Shekinah are judged worthy of eternal life. 3 So also there are some who do not die as men die commonly, but are ravished by the attraction which Shekinah exercises on their souls. 4 The Mother in transcendence is, however, like the Mother below, and spiritual communion with her is in so far as man has become a house or abode by attaching himself to the female : it is then that the Divine Mother pours down her blessings on both. 5 There is in the true sense of this term a spiritual union below for the Sons of the Doctrine, so that they are encompassed by two females G the wife who is on earth and the Unseen Helpmate. After what manner her presence is realised never transpires definitely in the text, but as there is no need to say it is by spiritual apprehension only. Curiously enough, this appears at its best not in connection with the nuptial state itself but in the discourses of the Sons of the Doctrine on the Traditional Law ; they are conscious then of the presence of Shekinah and testify respecting it continually with no uncertain voice.

When, however, the master of the Law was going by himself upon a journey, and when, technically speaking, the male was to be apart from the female, he was not for that reason in a state of separation from the Shekinah, supposing that he had prayed to the Holy one before starting, 1 in order to maintain the union between male and female abroad as well as at home. Another condition was that he must watch over all his actions in every phase of life : 2 otherwise he might be separated from his spiritual companion, putting a stop to the union and rendering himself an incomplete being. It is scarcely desirable at this stage to speak of any thing so obvious and familiar as the known character istics of oriental imagery, to recall for example the personifications of Wisdom in the books ascribed to King Solomon ; but the literary vestures of these ex perienced two curious developments. The titles and offices of the Hebrew Chokmah were raised bodily from their setting and transferred to the Blessed Virgin by the compilers of the Roman Breviary, while through another channel they passed over to the Gnostic Sophia and by a last transition into the Virgin Wisdom of Jacob Bohme and the later mystics of his school. The cor respondences between Shekinah and the Christian Mother of God are rather plausible on the surface and may be deceptive to that extent, because shallow analogies still deceive many ; but even the unusual predispositions which led up to the French translation of the Zohar have not permitted its editors to postulate that the Shekinah is a veil of Mary.

There is one possible alternative that the root-matter of Jewish tradition in the Scrip tures of the Old Testament developed in his own con sciousness, to some extent after the same manner as it did in that of the Sons of the Doctrine, so that in his case, as in others without number, it proved that true men and seers spoke the same language because they belonged to the same region of thought. They saw also in the same glass of vision. But the question, however interesting, is not of our real concern. We have now considered the Shekinah in the light of all her attributes. I do not believe that I have omitted a single reference of the least importance found in the text of the Zohar, while all have been considered criti cally. The conclusion reached is that the Shekinah, as the president of a mystery of sex, is the direction in which we must seek if as labourers in this strange field we are to obtain our wages. The other intimations are excellent and agreeable in their way, but that which we seek in what is for us an untrodden region of thought is some new message, which is not to be found in the other offices, qualities and virtues that characterise the Holy Guide of Jewry.

It may be an open question whether I should begin at the highest point of the research and thence work downward or take the opposite course and so as the proverb counsels proceed from small beginnings to the greater end. That is best which seems the simplest, and I have therefore chosen to work upwards from below. I will cite in the first place certain great axioms of the whole subject as these have been proclaimed on the authority of the masters. It is testified that the union of the male and female must be a perfect union in the mystery of faith. 1 There is also another testimony, already given, and this is that the title to behold the face of Shekinah is one of purity, 2 the scholium on which though it lies far away in the text is that modesty is the union of the male and female ; 3 and it may be noted in this connection that the most cryptic of all texts in the Zohar containing the mys teries of Divine personalities is called The Book of Con cealment or of Modesty. These things being so, we may consider in the next place what is said on the subject of espousals, as these are known on earth. There is one definition which is in keeping with the tradition at large, and this is that marriage is the union of the Sacred Name 1 Z., Ft. I, fol. ioib ; DE PAULY, II, u. 2 Ib,, Pt.

The thesis appertaining hereto is that circumcision is the symbol of all purity in sexual intercourse ; 2 that Israel is placed on this account in purity as a starting-point and enters under the wings of the Shekinah. 3 This sacred sign of the Covenant constitutes the root-matter of the Sacred Name and of the Mystery of Faith. 4 As the sun enlightens the world, so the sacred sign enlightens the body ; as a buckler protects man, so does this : no evil spirit can approach him who preserves it in purity. 5 But as the advantage is greater with which the children of Israel begin their earthly life so is the responsibility greater if they make the covenant of no effect in their own persons. Now, the Sacred Name is never attached to an in complete man, being one who is unmarried, or one who dies without issue. 6 Such a person does not penetrate after death into the vestibule of Paradise, 7 on account of his incompleteness.

God blessed Adam because they were made together male and female, and blessings are found only where male and female are united for the fulfilment of the purpose of creation, 2 which according to the counsel of the Elohim was to increase, multiply and replenish the earth. It was not good for man to be alone because this end was in a state of frustration. It may even be that the Zoharic legend concerning the male and female being originally side by side may be only a veiled way of indicating that they were not in the marital estate. 3 Afterwards they were face to face, signifying the fulfil ment of the precept. I have now dealt briefly with what may be called the principles at issue, and we have next to see after whac manner those who exalted so highly the nuptial state gave instruction, so to speak, on its practice here below. The doctrine was that no marriage is made on earth before it is proclaimed in heaven, and that the Holy One accomplishes unions in the world above before the de scent of souls on earth. 4 About the last point we shall see at a later stage. In practice the Sons of the Doctrine were separated as far from the uninitiated world of Israel 1 Z., Ft. I, fol. 272b ; DE PAULY, II, 641.

Whether there was ever such an epoch in the history of the human soul is another question. We must remember that the object of the soul s legends is not the delineation of putative histories, but the symbolical adumbration of possibilities inherent in the soul.

But this is the time when the counsel to the Sons of the Doctrine is that they should arise for the study of the Law, for union thereby with the Community of Israel above and for the praise of the Sacred Name of God. 4 The Sons of the Doctrine are described as reserving conjugal relations for the night of the Sabbath, being the moment when the Holy One is united to the Community 1 Z., Pt.

The man is not, however, without the woman, and this is a thing to be marked because the contrary idea may be presented to some minds. The following curious point may be noticed in this connection. It is affirmed that the words: &quot;In the beginning God created &quot; (Gen. i, i) conceal the same mystery as those other words : &quot; And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made He a woman&quot; (/., ii, 22).

The principle is that the male must be always attached to the female for the Shekinah ever to be with him. 2 All holiness might be practised, the Secret Doctrine might be studied by night and by day, and the illuminations thereof might overflow the intellec tual part ; but failing fulfilment of this radical counsel a man was not on the way which leads into true life. 3 He was in that condition in which &quot; it is not good for man to be &quot; 4 alone, like Adam in the Garden. 5 But those who had the precept at heart and were therefore complete men by their union with women on earth, remind us in one particular of many students of the Middle Ages : they were travellers in search of wisdom ; and they were also men of affairs, workers in the vineyard of this world as well as in the Garden of God. The Zohar is full of their little journeys, and these as far as possible were taken one with another, so that the Secret Doctrine might be studied on the way and that the presence of Shekinah might be thus secured for their consolation, protection and instruction as they fared forward.

It was after all an unincorporated fraternity, and though it looks differently there and here, initiation was by a segregating principle and not by communication from a common centre of knowledge. The son of an instructed doctor might have advanced a great distance unknown to others, while occasionally an isolated student entered by his own reflections, and by grace descending into the heart, into the golden chain of tradition, so that he was not less in the light state than if he had sat at the feet of Rabbi Simeon through the days and the years. Now, journeys in search of wisdom or in the prosecution of business which, it may be mentioned, was often of a humble kind meant separation from the wife of the doctor s household, and this would seem at first sight to involve separation from Shekinah. 1 To remove this diffi culty it was held sufficient as we have seen (a) that the doctor should pray to the Holy One before starting and (b) should watch over all his actions during the period of absence from home. 2 He would not then be separated from his spiritual companion, nor would he put that stop to the union between male and female which would render him an incomplete being. It was understood further that the counsel which prevailed abroad must prevail at home also, so that what was inculcated was really a precept of life.

The reason is that the union below is an image of the union that is above. The mystery of the whole subject is that the Mother in transcendence abides with the male only in so far as he has constituted himself a house by his attachment to the female : there must be a local habitation, an union below to offer a point of con tact with the union that is on high, and then the Divine Mother pours down her blessings thereon that is to say, on male and female in equal measures. 2 So is the male below said to be encompassed by two females, and all the ways of blessing in the two worlds are open before him. 3 He reads the Secret Doctrine in the womanhood on earth, and it is read to him by her who sits between the pillars of the eternal Temple with the Book of the Secret Law lying open on her sacred knees. 4 1 It is part of the contemplation of the absent and higher beauty in union with that beauty which, albeit lower, is present, manifest and is or may become sacramental.

It follows that the Supreme Mystery and the Mystery of Faith are one as [ have said and are also the Mystery of Union of Male and Female in the Divine Nature, behind which I infer that there is a mystery of experience in man. Let us now take another legend of the soul which is not quite in consonance with some things that have pre ceded, as it postulates a continual generation as fruit of the eternal union between the Father and Mother in transcendence 2 in place of a creation of souls once and for all prior to the evolution of the created universe. That which follows is more in consonance with the Mystery of Faith, and is in fact one of its aspects.

This seems to me an allusion to a pre-natal state, for things must be referred to their natures ; the spiritual unions are one thing and have their own end; the physical union is another and Nature thereby insures the perpetuation of species. 2 Hence it is said that man understood as male and female is the synthesis of Jehovah and Elohim.

The Scripture adds : &quot; And fowl that may fly upon the earth,&quot; 3 because at the moment when the newly created soul traverses the heavenly region called &quot; living &quot; meaning the Land of Life it is accompanied by many angels, who have followed it from the time that it was detached from the Tree of Heaven. 4 Those who abstain from practising the precept : &quot;Increase and multiply&quot; diminish if it be per mitted so to speak the celestial figure, centralisation of all figures ; they arrest the course of the celestial river and defile the Holy Alliance. 5 We have seen that this is a sin against God Himself; the soul of such a man will never penetrate into the vestibule of Paradise and shall be repulsed from the world above. 6 After this manner does the Zohar indicate yet again that from the beginning of the sacred text it is concerned with the history of man rather than the external cosmos and, by inference, with the history of Israel rather than of man at large.

The souls of all Gentiles emanate from the demons under circumstances which are not explained in the Zohar. 1 The suggestion is sometimes that they are from the left side of the Tree, but the question is exceedingly obscure, 2 because God and His Shekinah are everywhere in the Tree of the Sephiroth, and though there is a sense in which God is allowed to have created evil, the position is by no means maintained with any consistency through out. It was left for late Kabalism to contrive its own way of escape from the difficulty, for which purpose it devised the idea of postulating ten Sephiroth in each of the four worlds, as also in each Sephira. There is practically no warrant for this in the original text, though there is a trace of some septenary repetition of Sephiroth in the in dividual Sephiroth. There was, however, the case of those who were converted from Paganism to Jewry and fulfilled the whole law thereafter ; it was necessary that they should be reconciled on all the planes or it would serve no pur pose to receive them into the fold ; and it was therefore postulated that after undergoing circumcision they entered under the wings of Shekinah and were separated from the side of the Demons. 3 They did not participate, in the 1 It is affirmed elsewhere, on the contrary, that they come from the Divine World ; but the question is negligible, as anything that is found in the Zohar on the subject of unbelievers is antecedently known to be worthless, all Secret Doctrine notwithstanding.

Zoharic Kabalism recognised, moreover, an averse Tree under the title of Inferior Crowns, in analogy with the Crowns that are above, namely, the true Scphiroth. The salient allusions are as follows : (a) There are ten averse Crowns and they are in analogy with ten varieties of magic, all understood as infernal, for the Zohar very properly recognises no distinction between &quot;Black and White in the occult arts.

The implicit is of course that the male body contains a male soul and that the soul of a woman is female, though there is an obscure sense in which any soul is male to any body but is female to the degree which is above it. 2 Another implicit can be recognised which is more to our purpose that he who abides in the true way will meet in marriage with the woman-soul which was his pre natal companion. 3 If he has deviated it may happen that the woman predestined to him is espoused to 1 Though there has been no occasion to dwell upon it, seeing that I am not concerned with the maintenance of orthodox theological views or their opposites, I think that the reader has abundant proof in his hands by this time that the Zoharic system as a whole is no more emanationist than pantheistic.

Yet another story of palaces tells us that there are four which are exclusive to women, or at least to holy mothers, but it is forbidden to reveal their nature. 1 Daring the day the females are separated from the males, but the spouses are in union at night, and in their mutual embrace the lights of both dissolve into a single light. The conclusion reached on this sub ject is that blessed is the lot of the just, male as well as female, for they shall enjoy all delights in the world to come. 2 We are led on in this manner to the great mystery of the subject, as to which there are several testimonies. It rests on the witness of a testament bequeathed by Rabbi Eieazar the Great 3 that when the Holy One comes down into Paradise at midnight the male souls are united to the female ; fecundation follows from the joy which they experience in the contemplation of God, and they bring forth other souls 4 which are destined to occupy the bodies of Gentiles who will become converts to the Law of Israel. 5 But, almost immediately, this is explained after a different manner : the souls born of celestial unions are reserved in a palace, and when a man is converted one of them takes flight and comes under the wings of She- kinah, who embraces her because she is the fruit of the just in their intercourse and sends her into the body of a convert where she or he remains, and from that moment the convert acquires the title of just. 6 This is the mystery of those words in Scripture : 4C The fruit of the just is the Tree of Life.&quot; 7 There is, however, by yet another testimony, a general sense in which the Holy 1 Z., Pt.

There are a few minor points which I will mention at this stage. It is said that all depends on thought and intention ; holiness is attracted by good thought ; but he who defiles himself by thought, and he who at the moment of fulfilling the act of intercourse with his wife thinks of another woman changes the degree above the degree of holiness into one that is impure. 3 We may compare the elective affinities of Goethe, for the child born of such union is called a substituted son : soul and body are held to be alike substituted. The second point is that there are rare occasions when conjugal relations seem forbidden, even on the Sabbath, and periods of famine are a case in point : 4 the child born at such a season will be from the side of the demon.

It is a very simple transfer of an earthly image, but the legion does not consist of human souls. 1 We are now at the end of our inquiry into the Mystery of Sex, so far as the statements in the text are concerned, and that which remains is to determine whether the path which was followed by the early Kabalists may have led them into any experience of the spiritual kind that is implied rather than expressed in the records before us. I will suppose that they followed the counsel on which those records insist, and as it in volved a distinct mode of procedure in connection with an important fact of life, the insistence, as it seems to me, must indicate that in the experience of things the method had proved of practical service. In other words, they had found that there is a mystery of nuptials of which it has not entered into the heart of man to con ceive in the ordinary ways and under the common motives of desire. 2 There is one beautiful point to observe in this connection that their mystery lay within the pure offices of Nature, under all the accepted war rants.

On the other hand, the ideal presented in the Zohar stands for true and life-long consecration on the highest plane ; it is not the ceremonial of a moment which puts a kind of eccle siastical veneer over something that was less or more abhorred. Here is the first point, and the second in all simplicity is added on the hypothesis, at its value, that the ideal did more than exist on paper and may repre sent the practice of a secret school. We are told by the records that the fruit of the mystic intercourse was the begetting of children from what is called the Holy Side, as against the side of the demons, and I believe that this was a Kabalistic way of accounting for the literal fact that children born of such unions belonged to another category than we are accustomed to meet with in the streets and byways of daily life all the world over, or for that matter to be familiar with in our own homes.

With all his imperfections, the writings of Eliphas Levi, who is now well known in England, should have done much to correct this view, and there are other sources of information. When William Postel trans lated the Sepher Telzirah and so made a certain begin ning of public knowledge concerning the literature of Kabalism, the magical grimoires, which are a depra vation at a very far distance of certain Kabalistic notions, were already extant in manuscript and indeed in some printed forms. To describe these testimonies of the dregs and lees of life and quest as holding in any true sense from the tradition of Israel is unques tionably to place upon them an undue imputed import ance. They contain ignorant travesties of Hebrew Divine Names, angelical titles and things of this order. There is no doctrine attached to them, no practice which reflects anything in the sacred literature at large : it would be almost as reasonable at first sight to suggest that the makers of grimoires had drawn from Hebrew copies of the Old Testament with some additions from the Greek of the Gospels or the Rites of the Orthodox Church.

Beyond this, and much more important that is to say, from the mystic stand point there is the fact that the voice of the Zohar testifies in no uncertain manner as to the view con cerning magic, its connections and derivations, held by all Sons of the Doctrine and imposed by inference on those who might seek to come after them, following in their path. This notwithstanding, we may find here and there in the long sequence of debate that the same standpoint is not maintained invariably on specific details, and there are certain statements which might lend colour to an opinion that the root-matter of one and another department of occult experiment may be found therein. It is said, for example, that there is a mystery known to the holy thaumaturgists con cerning the miraculous powers which inhere in the sacred celestial letters and that if these are written inversely, after a certain manner, the extinction of the guilty can be brought about thereby. 1 Now it is to be observed that the celestial characters are not those which are written with the hand by human scribes, but are the Great Letters, alive and givers of life, emblems of all intelligence and therefore endowed with understanding. By the Zoharic hypothesis, they existed before the creation and as we saw long ago one of them was concerned therewith. The explana tion of this fable is that, for all the sages of Israel, thought must pass into expression, because that which is done in heaven must be done also on earth.

After what manner the holy thaumaturgists brought down the celestial letters for the purpose under consideration, or for any other, is not told in the story, and I suppose that for sane persons there can be no question that the intimation must be understood allegorically, though I am not pro posing to explain after what manner as the unexpressed meaning exceeds my purpose. For the rest, I am certain that the Zohar was unknown to the adepts of magical workings ; it reflects there and here some practices which obtained in Jewry and the Talmuds are a source of sporadic information to those who would pursue the subject. The general thesis of the Zohar is that the science of magic came from the sages of the East, 1 and as it is said by the Scriptures that the wisdom of Solomon surpassed that of the Egyptians, as well as of all the East, 2 it seems to be understood that he drew from some superior source, in respect of occult science. The intention is not, however, either to exonerate the science or to justify the king in this branch of his learning. He seems to have pursued it when he fell away from justice, but it was otherwise during the building of the Temple : 3 then he beheld wisdom face to face and 1 Z., Pt.

In virtue of his communications with the abyss, Pharaoh himself was skilled more highly in occult practices than any of the magicians he employed. 4 Abraham as we have seen was drawn in this direction, and when he first went into Egypt it was for the profound study of Egyptian occult science, though not as one who was seduced nor one who became attached thereto. 5 He penetrated the secret of evil only to reascend towards the good. As regards the later children of the East and their wisdom, there is a sense in which Abraham was himself a fountain of knowledge, for the presents made by him to the children of his concubines seem to have been a medley of true knowledge and occult arts, which were taken eastward and deteriorated in the course of the centuries. 6 There is therefore a vestige of truth in the eastern wisdom, but it is combined with magic is older than the Deluge ; it existed also during the patriarchal age.

The authority for this statement is not fortunately the Secret Tradition in Israel but a book of magic said to have been transmitted to Solomon by the demon Asmodeus. 2 It affirms also that the Holy Spirit demands a price, must be bought and the cost is high. The Zohar explains that this price is one of effort for the puri fication of heart and soul, that the aspirant may be made worthy of serving in the tabernacle of the spirit.

Every three groups have at their head a chief placed in charge of one or other nation of the earth. 4 These chiefs in their turn are overruled by superiors entrusted with the direction of the stars, so that each nation is indirectly under the influence of a certain star, which, it will be seen, is another astrological intimation. Hence the destiny of one nation is never like that of another. 5 The reign of these chiefs will continue till the Holy One shall Himself come down and govern here below. 6 Most curious of all is the intimation that if these degrees or groups are disintegrated there will be found at the centre a sacred kernel which draws all, even the impure side. 7 Having regard to the consideration allotted to the interpretation of dreams by the Old Testament, it would surpass expectation if the Zohar rejected the possibility, more especially with the authority of the Talmud to support the affirmative view.

The explanation is probably that the dream-inter preter was in a kind of prophetic state, but this is to be distinguished from the ceremonial and magical use of words, as for example when it is said of the pre-diluvian sorcerers that, with the aid of the mysteries contained in their secret book, it was enough for them to utter words and the desired things were accomplished.

There could be no greater opportunity, for I have indicated that the Zohar assumes throughout a more or less perfect familiarity with the chief heads of its subject, and it is not therefore concerned with presenting a formal system of the Secret Doctrine. The later Kabalists provided that which was wanted there and here out of their own heads, with the help of any flotsam and jetsam of theosophical reverie which was passing from mouth to mouth in and about the Academies from Sapeth to Beaucaire. We know that about the middle of the eighteenth century two sects arose in Jewry, claiming the Zohar as their authority in chief. One was the sect of Pietists or New Hassiaim, which rejected the Talmud, together with external forms, and was zealous in the practice of Contemplative Prayers, as recommended by the Zohar to those who are in search of inward know ledge concerning Divine Mysteries. It was incorporated for the quest of perfection along these lines. Solomon Maimon has left some particulars concerning the vagaries of these enthusiasts, who were followers of Israel Baal Shem, and its vestiges were to be found in Poland at the middle of the nineteenth century. The second was the sect of Zoharists who belonged to the same country. It was established by Jacob Frank, and it embraced Chris tianity. I mention these matters, because they shew the kind of influence exercised by the Zohar at one period in a particular locality. Of its secret influence on remote continental Jewry, in places like Galicia above all, we shall probably never know, so that the later developments of Kabalism are without adequate records.

I have met with nothing on the mystery of sex which can be said to carry the subject further, and except for one contribution by Isaac de Loria 1 the concern was slight therein. Wherever there have been important developments on any matter they have appeared already in the annotations, and they stand at their proper value. In respect of one and all I may say that for those who believe that there was a floating tradition preserved among the doctors of Israel^ and transmitted from mouth to mouth, it will be advisable that they should not regard the later Kabalists as having reduced that tradition to writing. As I have indicated, that which they may have done was to reproduce current speculation to which they added their own. If the debates at Salamanca had ever been reduced into ^vvhat the Fama Fraternitatis R.C. calls &quot;a true memorial,&quot; the later Kabalists supposing that they had been admitted to the conclave might have made a contribution which would have been within the law and the order in respect of the rule of debate, and this is where they stand within their particular subject ; nor have I found that they make a higher claim, all their contentious voice of certi tude notwithstanding. 2 1 I know of this only through Rosenroth, who in the preface to his second volume gives a list of the Loria literary remains as collected by R.

It is the question of the Revolution of Souls, which was treated at great length by Isaac de Loria. 1 . So far as his repute is concerned at his particular period being that of the seventeenth century he was of almost indescribable lustre. The account of his literary memorials occupies a considerable space in the Kabbala Demdata, which also incorporated many hundreds of Loria extracts in the alphabetical apparatus which constitutes the bulk of the first volume. The treatise entitled De Revolutionibus Ani- marum is given in its entirety, and it is from this that my points are drawn. The sin of Adam resulted in an admixture of good and evil, and hence we are obliged to fulfil many re volutions before we attain reintegration. Two things followed, being (i) the necessity that man should sepa rate good from evil and then (2) reintegrate the good part. These dedications were accomplished by the perfect keeping of the Law, but this had to be done in thought and word and deed. Moreover, the Law must be studied according to its literal, allegorical, anagogic and mystical or Kabalistic sense, and the soul who has neglected one or more of these must return again and again to earth till he has become proficient in each and all. 2 There are two modes of return, one of which is passes almost through extravagance to blasphemy.

The embryonic state is that of a soul who enters into a man already born into the world and as it may be of adult age. The analogy which is instituted is one of the sex-order, for it is said that when a soul enters into such a person it is like entering the body of a woman who has conceived : it is this correspondence indeed which accounts for the conventional name ; and the state is like a new fecunda tion taking place in the adult man, who receives a new soul in addition to that which is called his radical soul. 3 This cannot occur till he has reached the age of thirty years and one day, being the period when he is held to doctrine when they were first made flesh could so be on a second occasion. Moreover, the Zohar never assumed that man could attain the knowledge of the whole Law, for that Law was infinite in depth of meaning. At the same time the conclusion of Isaac de Loria was natural enough, as in Law and in conduct the task imposed on Jewry was so arduous that it seemed antecedently unlikely for deficiencies to be fully atoned for if reincarnations were limited. 1 The hypothesis is that all souls, as a consequence of the catastrophe which befell Adam Prrtofilastes in the mystical garden, are suffering from an admixture of good and evil : they come into this world to remake themselves by separating the good from the evil. It is the whole work of life. r*A II. 2 This is called dlptl. 3 There is an overshadowing of the embodied by a disembodied personality recognised by the Zohar and referred to twice by the text, namely, in the discourse of the Ancient Man in Section Mishpatim. It is a very important section for many doctrines and ideas connected with transmigration. The thesis is (i) That all holy and superior souls which are destined to enter this world are accustomed while awaiting incarnation to descend from their residence on high and visit the Earthly Paradise at stated periods. (2) That they meet therein the souls of proselytes and other inferior souls which have been incarnated once only and cannot ascend higher. (3) That the superior souls clothe themselves with inferior souls, as if with a vesture, and are so joined to these during their sojourn in Paradise ; but they unclothe to return above. It is a particular illustration of the invariable teaching that the spirit is draped to come down and nndraped to go up. (4) That the inferior soul, so far from being degraded by this use as a vesture, profits through the experience ; but unfortunately at this point there is a break in the discourse of the Ancient Man, and the same thread is not resumed.

The embryonic state is twofold ; there is the case of a soul which is added to a man because it is in a condition of imperfection, something having been wanting in the fulfilment of one or another precept during a pre ceding revolution. Alternatively there may have been some precept which a particular calling or condition may have made it impossible to carry out : the levirate is an example in point. There is no occasion for a soul to descend into reincarnation for the repair of such a formal deficiency ; therefore it enters into the embryonic condition and fulfils the precept in the person of that man to whom it is attached. Secondly, a soul may fructify a man solely in the interest of the latter, that he may be led to perfection in obedience to the Law. There is a difference in the two cases, for when a soul returns to improve its own condition it is extended through the whole body of the man, like his own soul, and shares all misfortunes which befall the body. On the other hand, when the soul comes for ministration and assistance to the man on earth it is not subject to his bodily suffer ings and there is no fixed time for the indwelling ; it seems to be at the discretion of the soul and may con tinue so long as there is good will in the personality. But if the man falls into evil ways, separation follows and presumably the experiment has proved a failure. There is also more than one kind of reincarnation, though it is difficult to present the details in an exact manner without carrying explanations much further than one is warranted by their value or interest. Speaking rather roughly, more than one soul may reincarnate in a single body. If one person has led another person away both will suffer rebirth in the same body, he who was seducer that he may help the other to fulfil those duties from which he has turned him previously and thus repair 289 T"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine in Israel the evil of which he has been the cause. The fructifica tion which is implied by the embryonic state may take place between two living beings ; for example, if a just man alive on this earth is engrossed by the observance of a particular precept and if there is another of the same period who is making a struggle to fulfil it, the Nephesh or lower soul of the just man may impregnate the other, though both are leading their separate personal lives. There are several reasons for reincarnation but they are reduced to four as follows, (i) A soul returns because it contracted a vice in its previous life and its period of rebirth is consecrated to the reparation of the sin in question. In this case it is easy for reincarnate man to sin afresh. (2) Another soul returns to fulfil and perfect some neglected precept, and this soul will be less likely to sin than one who comes back to atone for a specific vice. (3) Yet other souls come to lead men into justice, to conduct them along the path of goodness and not for any concern of their own. These are absolutely certain to avoid sin. (4) Finally some souls return because in the previous incarnation they have not deserved to receive the beloved spouse or sister-soul belonging to them, but they will do so in their second birth. The number of souls who will reincarnate in a single body is limited to four, or there may be a new soul, not previously incar nated and now appearing in conjunction with three old souls. The same rule applies to the embryonic state, the limit being three souls therein in addition to the root-soul belonging to the incarnate personality. I have spoken here of the principles which are held to be at work in the two states specified, and I feel that the matter can be left at this point.

It is not worth while to follow out a speculation of this kind unless the canon of criticism on which it rests should be found to speak with authority, and this is by no means the case.

Herein, as in my other writings, I am dealing only with an epoch of Christendom. If it could be shewn that the Zohar did not antecede the twelfth or thirteenth century in any part of the collection, even this substi tuted antiquity would be adequate for my purpose, if I found that its intimations offered aspects of importance within the measures of Secret Tradition. There was assuredly a Secret School of Kabalism, and it is a subject of incessant reference in the Zohar under the general title of Sons of the Doctrine. Whether it was an incorporated school is another question. It is said in one place that man is renewed or reborn by every new idea respecting the Secret Doctrine 1 almost as if the latter constitutes a sequence of principles, presupposed and wholly understood, out of which many developments might issue. It was not consequently always a matter of tradition. Granting that there was this common or general root, not only were fresh lights possible but their discovery became a source of joy where and when soever it rose, with whomsoever it might be for a mouth piece. 2 The disciples of the Zohar held open minds, giving ready even rapturous welcome to any new idea, if it carried the proper warrants. But it is said further, -and not in full consonance with what I have just intimated, that the message must be one of a master meaning pre sumably that he must either be known as such or must prove himself. 3 It was a case, however, that by his own words ye shall know him. A stranger in the course of 1 Z., Pt.

As to the latter classes the counsel was one of silence, because he who pronounces sentences without having attained the grade of a master of sentences would produce only mis fortunes. 2 Under the guide of ordinary reason, one would say that this must be interpreted intellectually, as of the misfortunes of ignorance, mistakes and mental mischances, or confusions arising therefrom. However, Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai cautioned his auditors on one occasion never to pronounce a word touching the Secret Doctrine without being entirely certain as to its exact ness. 3 To do otherwise might cause the death of legions. This is an alleged consequence which calls to be under stood physically, and I mention it because although it can be nothing but a grotesque hyperbole of speech 4 it looks for a moment as if the great teacher of Kabalism were quoting the penal clause of a pledge by which the Sons of the Doctrine were bound together.

It may be of the tenth century and it may be earlier ; some vestiges may even go back to pre-Christian times, but this does not signify. 1 The literature of alchemy made a great and new beginning, somewhere about that period, or when it assumed a Latin garb : the literature of the Holy Graal was posterior by some two centuries ; the other written testimonies to the Secret Doctrine under the asgis of Christendom were products of a still later period. What was the message of theosophical Jewry in comparison with the alternative messages ? As a purpose in litera ture, does it connect with the other and the later pur poses, as a school with some other schools in respect of the end proposed or is it of itself and no other ? The mystery of the Graal is of the mystical body of Christ ; the mystery of alchemy is many sided, but on one side it is of the body of man in its transmutation ; the mystery of Rosicrucianism is one of Divine Union, but here again there is more than a single aspect and one is the body of resurrection ; the mystery of speculative Masonry is of the building up of man into a spiritual house, meet for the inhabitation of God. And the Secret Doctrine of Israel concerns a mystery of sex summarised as the mystical body of Shekinah, while it includes the shadows and outlines of a science of perfection, of union also, therein, so that amidst all variations of process, distinction in symbolism and diversity as to root-ideas in doctrine, the question is answered by saying that it is not only in analogy but in living concurrence with the other witnesses.

I have been trying for some years past to hold up a certain glass of vision which tends to shew that the same term of research was sought everywhere in the secret literary schools and in two instituted mysteries belonging to the Christian centuries.

Now, the points at issue between Israel and Chris tendom on the subject of Messiah are obviously of a very simple kind, so far as the ground is concerned, for unless the Christ of Nazareth as His story appears in the records had not offered, or had not been represented as offering, at least some considerable proportion of the marks and seals by which He might be entitled to acknowledgment, the claim could not have been proffered on His own part, nor sustained on that of His believers. Otherwise, the expectation of Jewry was one thing and the event another, or there would have been no colourable basis for His rejection in the natural reason of things. I suppose that the time has gone past when it was thought possible to affirm that Jesus, Son of Mary and putative Son of the carpenter Joseph, was antecedently likely or tolerable as the Deliverer to come and that it was owing to wilfully hardened hearts, to eyes that were blinded wilfully, that He was not recognised as such. It is not less true that any claimant was, in a sense, antecedently improbable, because of the complete vagueness charac terising every intimation by which He is supposed to be foreshadowed. As it so happens justly or unjustly Israel expected a Deliverer who would be a mighty warrior before the face of the Lord Who sent him and before the faces of the nations whom he was to scatter, who was to deliver the Gentiles into the hands of Jews, that the one might be sacrificed by the other to that Samae l who is the master of the Gentiles.

The speculative thesis before us is that by the evidence, expressed or implied, of Sepher Ha Zohar the Messiah has come. So far as expression is concerned this thesis is manifestly untrue, while so far as implica- cation goes I am very certain that the text is on the opposite side. It contains no particle of real evidence concerning that imputed sect in Jewry which under the title of Sons of the Doctrine had confessed to the Christ of Nazareth and were putting forward their views under veils. It is clear, in the first place, that if such evidence exists it lies within the veils ; it is not I repeat suggested that it is part of the surface sense, and hence the question is reduced to its minimum so far as circumstances will permit. In the second place, I have to shew that it is not contained in the hidden sense.

The counter-thesis requires very careful tabulation, as it is scattered through a great many notes and is not presented formally. I shall connect it with two subsidiary points, which will illustrate further the un critical bias with which we are called to deal. In respect of Shekinah and Messiah it is maintained that the former designates the Second Degree of the Divine Essence, otherwise the Second Person, in Chokmah and is also the Word. The Shekinah in transcendence is the Word before incarnation and below is the Word made flesh. It is stated in the Zohar that the Shekinah does become incarnate and in so doing assumes the form of man. The incarnation of Messiah is by operation of the Van, and the Zohar indicates that there is unity between God and the Redeemer. This incarnation of the He, or Word, is recognised by Rabbi Simeon. The Messiah is Metatron, or the body of Shekinah which is said to be the same thing. The Lesser Countenance of the Idras designates the Word incarnate on earth, and the Greater Countenance is the Word prior to manifesta tion in created things. One passage of the Zohar is declared to have no meaning unless the incarnation is admitted, while it is held that another announces the mystery in formal words.

I feel that the whole question is determined already in a negative sense by my readers as well as myself, but I will analyse the various clauses, so that no false impression may be possible. (i) We have seen that the Shekinah is on both sides of the Tree ; that it is in Chokmah as well as Binah, because the Supernals are in unity ; that it is in Kether for the same reason. (2) We have seen that the Holy One uttered forth the Word and that the Builder who is Shekinah acted thereon ; there is thus a distinction between God, His Word and the Architect, but again the Three are One, because all is one in Atziluth. The statement that Shekinah in transcendence is the Word before manifestation and below is the incarnate Word is made on several occasions, but unfortunately in respect of extracts which carry no conviction because they do not convey the intended message. It is said, for example, in the Zohar that the daily morning sacrifice 2 is signified in the words of Isaiah which it renders: &quot; And the Lord shall keep thee always in repose &quot; ; 3 but this sacrifice of the morning-tide is held by the French editors to mean the Shekinah above, while the afternoon sacrifice signifies the Shekinah in manifestation.

This is for our delectation ; but as an instance of their canon of criticism the editors have recourse to the Talmud, where they find that the Sabbath came secretly into the world, unlike other gifts of God to Israel, and thence they conclude that the only Daughter is the only Son and was born secretly in flesh. (3) It is never said in the Zohar that the Shekinah becomes incarnate and much less that then it assumes the form of man. The passage referred to specifies that the letter Vau is a symbol of the body of man in an erect position, and adds cryp tically : 2 &quot; Hence God willed that Shekinah should be present at the building of the Tabernacle&quot; by Moses. The editors argue that if this does not mean what they postulate there is no sense in the passage. The second alternative is preferable to the arbitrary construction. (4) The Zohar does not say that the incarnation of Messiah is operated by the Vau. The passage in ques tion is dealing with Gen. xix, 33, concerning the first born daughter of Lot : &quot; And he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.&quot; The word which corresponds to &quot; arose&quot; in Hebrew &quot; is augmented by a Vau&quot; to shew that the child whom she conceived was to constitute the stem of Messiah. 3 (5) The incarna tion of the He or Word is not recognised by Rabbi Simeon, who is referring only to the descent of Shekinah into Egypt, 4 accompanying Israel and guarded by 42 angels, as we have seen elsewhere.

I will mention only one thing more on this part of the subject. The He final comes down to earth and has done so from the beginning of things, according to the Zohar. If we could suppose for a moment that there is authority in the text for an actual incarnation of the He that is, of Shekinah she could appear only as a woman, or the whole symbolism would be falsified. There is indeed one passage in which the Daughter of the King is said to have taken flesh 2 but Metatron was her body, even as Shekinah herself is said in another place to be the body of the Holy One. It is flesh of the Land of Life and not of earth. If any personality symbolised by any consonant of the Sacred Name is really expected by Kabalism to assume the limitations of mortality in the bonds of the body of earth, that consonant is Vau, and what is meant can be only the incarnation of the Begotten Son, who is assuredly the Lesser Countenance of the Idras.

For this feminine personality there is no room in the Christian scheme, because although I regard Shekinah as practically identical with the Blessed and Holy Spirit, the suggestion that this latter is in the relation of wife to Messiah or belongs to the side of womanhood means that Latin Trinitarian doctrine calls to be revised and the French editors are evidently under the obedience of Rome in respect of official religion. Having reached this point, we can deal shortly with their views on the subject of the Holy Spirit, Which is identified with the Van of the Sacred Name and is located in Einah.

As regards that place in the Zohar where the Indwelling Glory is plainly identified with the Holy Spirit, 1 the difficulty is disposed of by saying that it is a transcriber s mistake ; but to justify this, even in a preliminary sense, the error would have to be characteristic of one codex only, plus any edition or manuscript which may have derived indubitably therefrom.

Such separation means of course affliction for Kabalism. There is, how ever, some undemonstrable way in which this under standing of unleavened bread is held to mean the Eucharist in which case it can be only that of the Latin rite, where the bread is in separation from the wine. There is also a Zoharic reference to the offering of bread and wine, the one representing joy and the right side, while the other is the left and is therefore affliction, though it is not specified in the text. 3 This, say the editors, exposes clearly the mystery of the Blessed Sacrament. We are prepared in such manner for the last suggestion which I feel called to mention here. At the death of Rabbi Simeon, his son, Rabbi Eleazar, overcome with grief, exclaims that &quot;all the colleagues should drink blood.&quot; 4 This indicates the &quot; offering of the Holy Sacrifice and proceeding to transubstantiation.&quot; Under all these considerations, not to speak of many others of similar purport and intention, we can under stand that the Kabalistic Community of Israel is re garded as the Church of God, in the sense of the Christian Church.

It follows, however, another path of symbolism, and there is this further to be said that, perhaps more than most others in the great schools, the doctors of the hidden Law realised that it has not entered into the heart of man to conceive what God has prepared for those who love Him. They must have known at least how the experience transcends expression, as the mourn ful failures of mystic literature bear witness on every side. I take it that this is why the union of male and female which is their adopted form of symbolism the more it is raised into the transcendence is the deeper covered with veils. On the sanctification of the natural act and the path therein, they speak with reasonable fulness, all things perhaps considered. They are ex plicit also on the correspondence between things above and below therein, but there is not a word or part of a word which tells of the end attained.

The necessity of this call and the departure which follows thereon resides in the fact that whatsoever is pro duced in this world is in a state of separation ; union exists only in the world above, according to the words : &quot;From thence it was parted and became into four heads.&quot; 5 This is held to be the doctrine of distinction, diversity and inevitable separateness in the way of mani festation. The path is followed in the faith which pre cedes experience, and the postulate of this faith abides in the recognition of unity in heaven, on earth and in all the worlds. Those who can realise along this line are counted among the just whose will is done by the Holy One. 6 The Zohar in this place is either written more wisely than its makers knew or we have a hint of secret doctrine which never passed fully into expression. The essential of progress in the path is that man shall apply himself to the study of the Law and shall cleave thereto, so that he may be judged worthy of being united to the Tree of Life. 7 This is another symbol of the union, for 1 Z., Pt.

The analogy breaks at this point and is not restored by (3) the hypothesis that Adam and Eve were originally side by side, which hypothesis is grounded on certain monstrous births that occur from time to time in humanity and are a yoking but not an unity. Nor is it restored by a literal understanding of Genesis, according to which Eve was dormant in Adam, not active and conscious within him, for in the latter case he could not have been said to be alone. There is finally no intention of maintaining the corre spondence, because (4) the original generation of souls was in separation as male and female, and (5) this dis tinction will continue to be maintained in the eternal world by the mode of simple reunion in companionship, plus a transcendental intercourse the rapture of which is increased by a visual contemplation therein of God and His Shekinah, Who is also God.

We are not concerned with applying tests of value to the metaphysical part of the doctrine, for its collation with other doctrines leads to insuperable difficulties, some of which have been illustrated by the lights of later Kabalism. There is, however, the doctrine of experience, and I wish to say that if we accept Zoharic teaching on its own warrants, then the imitation on earth of that which is operated in the transcendence, being done if I may so express it in the sense of God s ineffable union, did not unreasonably become, in the eyes of those who not only held the doctrine but performed the prac tice, a work of sanctification. Now, the question is where it may have brought them. The Zohar is silent thereon, except in so far as it testifies with no uncertain voice to the presence of the Shekinah in the houses of the holy doctors of the Law. But this presence followed them in their travels abroad, and there is one allusion at least to a state in which it was realised invariably as indwelling in the soul. 1 It seems to me that there are three qualities of intimation as to a Divine Realisation in consciousness resulting from the manner of life laid down as indispensable thereto. In this case the Sons of the Doctrine walked not only by faith but by expe rience, and it follows that this mystery in its practice had a consequence within themselves as well as in their children. More than this cannot be said on the evidence which lies before us, and of the issue which came of the unions thus adumbrated it is obvious that we can say nothing. One of the Instituted Mysteries tells us in its moving ritual that the children of philosophers belong to philosophy, and we may believe that in the case under notice they were worthy of their high calling and birth right. 1 Z., Pt.

There is firstly the doctrinal side, and it will be seen that those among us who belong to the Christian tradition, more especially on the orthodox side, must be conscious that they are moving through the great text as through a strange world of images vestiges of many pantheons, many systems of the past, and legends of the soul of man. I have mentioned already that the theological doctrine of the Trinity must complete its own symbolism, if it is to be held as a product of the logical mind, and that therefore the Eternal Father is ex hypothesi the Eternal Mother, or in the sense and reason of things there could be no generation of an Eternal Son. The Zoharic male and female in the Deity cannot be therefore repugnant to the Trinitarian. Beyond this point the Kabalistic system moves farther and farther, as it pro ceeds, from the authorised fields of theology. If it were not complicated by irreconcilable elements in the medley of texts and testimonies, so that on the one hand we have the creation of souls en masse, as if by the conventional Fiat, and on the other their unceasing generation as the result of Divine Communion, to say nothing of the minor alternatives, there is much that is suggestive in the second dream, and for those who feel able to accept any definite hypothesis on the subject it may have an appealing aspect. We know also that the tradition of souls being created, generated or otherwise evolved in pairs is old and far diffused.

The nuptials of Rabbi Simeon at the close of the Lesser Holy Assembly were, one feels, of another order 3 than most of the psychic marriages proclaimed in the Zohar. When, however, the scheme is detached to some extent from its setting, it is worth while formulating its irreducible minimum as follows : (i) The Communion of the Divine Duality, Ineffable Male and Female, in the supernal world, generates human souls, male and female, in Its own likeness, who assume flesh according to a law of succession.

I do not know of any light on the mystery of man s beginning in his inward state which carries the seals of mastery, for the literature of mystic attainment, the records of our precursors on the path which leads to God, have nothing to testify thereon, as it is not the concern of their experience. Each school reproduces therefore the accepted teaching of its time and place. 1 The Zohar shews in its own manner that the end is like the beginning, and if it be only a tale of faerie, it is one of grace as such.

If we take the Christian records, that part of them which deserves to be called mystic is either a study of conditions, processes, practices leading to the term in God or it is concerned with the experience attained in the term. The first may depend from dogma e.g. the idea that an ascetic path is of Divine counsel but it does not explain the counsel or ordinance ; the second is a realisation of the Divine in consciousness and has nothing to do with vision, as when Dr. John Pordage seems to have seen the Trinity manifest in arbitrary forms.

I have said at the beginning of this chapter that the form of symbolism adopted in respect of Divine attainment by the doctors of the Hidden Law is that of male and female in their union ; it begins here on earth and it is raised into all the heavens ; mutatis mutandis it is the same kind of intercourse on all the planes 1 and all planes or worlds are in communication one with another, not merely by the analogy which ob tains but in a manner which is represented by the recurring image of the world above being married to the world below. We have seen that he is called perfect and blessed who knows how to effect such an union, and this so far as the individual is concerned can be only by fulfilling that which he is appointed to do under the pro visions of the Secret Law. My hypothesis is that in so doing he became conscious of what for want of a better expression I must term the cosmic union, in which the personal act was merged, so that he shared in the loving intercourse which obtains, according to Kabalism, above and below. By this also the worlds are bound together, God is united to creation and the soul of man partakes within its proper measures and under the reserves of all the veils by which he is covered during the life of earth of that universal and divine communion. I have said that there are intimations of this state in eastern teaching, by which I mean India, but that so far as I am aware they have not passed into writing.

It would be possible to carry these considerations much further, but I do not feel that they are meant for presentation at length in this place. The suggestion is that, expressed in very plain language, there is something to be fulfilled between man and woman by a marriage of Nature and Grace of which the sacramental aspect some times attributed to earthly marriage is the merest shadow and vestige. We have seen what Zoharic theosophy adum brates on this work ; I have found the same testimony in the allegories of some alchemical books, 2 and there are vestiges of the experience or of notions concerning the experience in the Philadelphian mystical school of the late seventeenth century in England. 3 It is better for the moment at least that those who feel drawn in this direction, with clean hearts and minds turned towards God, should follow out the research for themselves in the literatures to which I have alluded.

I have called it elsewhere The Book of tJie Silence of Hermes. 3 From this point of view and otherwise all the writings belonging to the Philadelphian school demand consideration anew, including Robert Roach s Imperial Standard of Messiah Triumphant, Theologia Mystica of John Pordage, the works of Jane Lead, and the rare Philadelphian Transactions. 3*9"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"&quot;The Secret Doctrine in Israel see that the analogy instituted by the Latin Church be tween those who are joined in wedlock and the union of Christ with His Church has a deeper meaning than has been discerned in the public ways, that in certain grades of consecration the spouse and the beloved on earth do stand for Christ the Lover of the soul and for the soul in that nuptial union which is called the mystic marriage in great and holy texts; the absconditus sponsus may be under veils of the living man, and the sponsa may realise in the person of her own consciousness that the soul is indeed the bride. I am the last person in the world to enforce practical conclusions, but if those who are prepared thereto within and without and this not too late in life were to enter the nuptial state and fulfil it consistently, as also with high reverence, in the sense of the Zohar, I think that the world might be changed and that a generation to come born of such unions would be children of a risen life. For the rest, in conclusion, it will be seen that I have not put forward the Secret Doctrine in Israel as one who regards its part major as of great theosophical and high mystical .importance, though I hold its memorials not merely as of living interest but as belonging to that kind which does not die, for at the back of all its reverie, the strange fantasia of symbols and images, there is the pulsating heart of a dedicated humanity, set in and out of season to justify the ways of God to those who could see through its particular glass of vision.

Yes, there is truth in Kabalism, all its contradictory messages notwithstanding ; the contradictions themselves are but turnings of the glass of mind, hither and thither, to encompass all directions opposites included, and in cluded the pairs of these. But the great message of all is the message of the Indwelling Presence, though it comes to us who are mystics under unwonted forms and in a peculiar radiance of vesture. The Divine Father hood is one side of the shield of faith and the other is Divine Motherhood. Whether we regard it as doctrine handed down from an immemorial past few of us can so regard it or whether we decide in our excess that it was conceived by Moses de Leon and born of his brain and pen, it is a wonderful heritage of mind which has come into our hands, and perhaps at this day it has a greater message for us than it had ever for our brothers in Jewry. I could almost wish that this Moses were the one and very man, for I do not think that in the wide world there would be the same kind of greatness as his.

It is the central root which I have men tioned, and from this root the Tree of Knowledge grows up. It becomes, as the Zohar intimates, the Tree of Life. At this end of our travelling, I feel that in these final words I have reached what was set before us when the work was first undertaken, namely, a term of quest, from which we can look back over the strange path that we have followed and can survey it under one light. The Shekinah is the high light which shines thereon. We have seen that this Lady of Mediation is the president over that nuptial intercourse which I have described as begun on earth and completed in the World of the Supernals.
