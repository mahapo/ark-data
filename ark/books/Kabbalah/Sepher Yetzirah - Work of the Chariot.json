Twenty-Two Letters are the Foundation : three Mothers, seven Doubles, and twelve Simple.

Twenty-Two Letters are the Foundation : He engraved them, He hewed them out, He comb ined them, and He set them at opposites, and He formed through them everything that is fo rmed and everything that is destined to be formed. 3. Twenty-Two Letters are the Foundation : He engraved them through Voice, He hewed th em out through Air, and He set them through the mouth in five places: Alef a , Chet x , Heh h , and Ayin i in the throat; Gimel g , Yod y , Kaf k , and Qof q on the palate; Dalet d , Tet u , Lamed l , Nun n , and Tav t with the tongue; Zayin z , Samek c , Shin s , Resh r , and Tzade o with the teeth; Beyt b , Vav v , Mem m , and Pey p with the lips. 4.

When Abraham our father, may he rest in peace, came, he: looked, and saw, and understood, and explored, and engraved, and hewed out, and succeeded. The Lord of All was revealed to him in His bosom, and He kissed him on hi s head and He called him “Abraham, my beloved,” 46 and He cut a covenant with him and his seed forever, as it is said, “And he believed in the Lord hvhy , and He considered it to him for righteousness.” 47 And He cut a covenant with him between the ten fingers of his hands, and that is the covenant of the tongue (Alef a ), and between the ten toes of his feet, and that is the covenant of the circumcision (Ayin i ), and He tied the twenty-two letters of the Torah 48 on his tongue, and He revealed to him His secret. He drew them through Water, He burned them in Fire, He shook them through the Air, He kindled them in the Seven, He led them through the twelve constellations. End of the Book of Formation   1 The thirty-two paths are the configuration of ten Sefiroth and twenty-two letter-gates. 2 A reference to the Name hvhy in the World of Atziluth (Emanation). 3 These are the borders of Chapter 5:2. 4 These are the gates that connect the Sefiroth. 5 These are the ten Sefiroth. 6 The Covenant of Unity ( dxy tyrb , B’rith Yachid ) is the Ayn ]ya projecting the unmanifest Alef of Unity a (Small Face) from which emanate (i.e. Atziluth) the supern al twenty-two letters; also corresponds to Consciousness in the roots of the Tree. 7 The Organ of the Tongue is the Alef a of Unity (Small Face). 8 The Organ of Nakedness is the Ayin i (Vast Face). 9 The Hebrew word here translated as “the Creator” has the literal meaning of “He who forms.” 10 The restoration herein described is a reference to the transformation of the Fallen Tree back into a Tree of Perfection. 11 The Sefiroth are created in pairs. 12 El Faithful King ( El Melekh Nehehman ), in the form of the well-known acronym “Amen,” is an epitaph which is used at the end of prayers by Jews, Christians, and Muslims. 13 See Torah Doverim 33:27. “Dwelling-Place” refers to the Sefi roth of the Inner Court of the Tree. 14 See Book of Enoch 14. Lightning emanates from a da rk cloud which, in the Qabalah, is an epitaph of Vast Face, further alluded to by the words “whose limits are without end” i.e. Ayn Sof (lit. Endless, or Without End). 15 See Atharva Veda , 2nd Mundaka, Canto 11:5: “That Thing, That is Such, is True:"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15       As from a fire, fully ablaze, fly off sparks, In their thousands, that akin to the fire... From Him emerges the Fire.” 16 In the Sama Veda , Chhandogya Upanishad 6:24, there is the Mahavakya (“Great Utterance”), “In the beginning, my dear, was Being Alone, One only without a second.” 17 O, Nothing, Ayn ]ya . The letter Ayin in Sinatic Hebrew is O. 18 These are instructions for meditation i.e. indrawing of senses, stilling of the mind. 19 Ezekiel 1:14. 20 Hebrew Ruach xvr , here translated as “Spirit.” 21 The Holy Spirit ( Ruach HaQodesh ) is the shell of embodied existence of the World of B’riyah (Creation). 22 Hebrew Ruach xvr , here translated as “Air,” m eaning Space, one of the Fathers. 23 Hebrew Mayim ,ym , here translated as “Water,” m eaning Matter, one of the Fathers. 24 “The Wall” is an array formed from all possible permutations of pairs of the respective twenty-two Hebrew letters rotated forward and backward. Some of these gates are known Hebrew “words,” with literal and hidden meanings, and some are unknown in these latter days. 25 Hebrew Esh sa , here translated as “Fire,” mean ing “Energy,” one of the Fathers. 26 Psalms 104:4. 27 The Shem HaMephoresh (“Brilliant Name of Fire”) is given here as vhy instead of hvhy because the action is occurring in Yetzirah (World of Formation), and the final Heh h of Asiyah (World of Making) is not active yet. 28 These are the same Sefiroth given in Chapter 1:5. Note that in the Sefer Yetzirah , Fire is alternately called Depth of Evil and Water is Depth of Good. 29 Mem m is the Scale of Merit, Shin s is the Scale of Guilt, Alef a is the Tongue of Statute. 30 This is a reference to the cycle mentioned in Chapter 2:4. 31 The Shem Echad (One Name) is the Name hvhy . 32 Hebrew a vir ryva , translated here as “air,” means Space. It is the opinion of the translator that ruach xvr was originally used for “Spirit” alone, and avir was used for Air, Space, and Atmosphere. However, ruach has become a synonym for avir in the six texts consulted: a. The Genizah text (940 CE). b. The Saadia Gaon text (950 CE). c. Two texts of the 15th Century in the Jewish Theological Seminary believed to be from Spain. d. Ha’Ari’’s text, which is considered to be the best of the six. e. A text of unknown origin published by Lewin-Epstein, Ltd. The Hebrew text used as the basis of this translation is a composite of the translator’s opinion of what the common text must have been to give rise to the above six texts. 33 The six rings are the Directional Sefiroth. 34 The use of the word ‘crown’ here implies the Atziluthic letters. In Sanskrit, there is a symbol called the anusvara which denotes that the letter to which it has been attached (actually above the letter) is in its Atziluthic form, and therefore pronounced differently. For example, the anusvara is prominent in the Sanskrit word Om Ð . Hebrew scribes also put crowns on the letters in the Torah to indicate their nature as dancing letters of fire. 35 Hebrew Avir ryva , here translated “Air,” meaning Atmosphere. 36 Geviyah hyvg is the subtle or astral body. The Sanskrit equivalent is the Linga Sharira (no English equivalent), and the subtle matter of this realm is called tanmatras . The tanmatras flow as currents through the subtle nerves of the Linga Sharira . It is interesting to note that the word Geviyah begins with the letter Gimel g , which is the gate that connects Sefirah Foundation/Below to Sefirah Beauty/The Last in the World of Yetzirah. The Gimel is followed by the letters hyv , which is the seal of the Sefirah Understanding/North, the supernal root of the World of Yetzirah. 37 This verse yields a variation of Fi g. “Holy Dwelling Place unto Eternity” from SY 1.5."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16       38 Torah B’reshith 1. 39 These stones are the Atziluthic letters. The Genizah text calls them, “The smooth stones that are sunk in the Abyss.” (A.M. Haberman, Sinai, 10th year, Jerusalem, 1947). 40 This description of the factorial numbers is an addition by the translator. 41 “The correspondence of the constellations with the mont hs in Chapter 6 (with no variations in the six texts considered) occurred during the time of Abraham, circa 4000 years ago. At this time (1974 BCE), the Sun is 58 degrees further to the West and stands in Leo during Tish ri due to the Procession of the Equinoxes. A check on the data logs of the old Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Greeks indicated that no one had astronomical knowledge of the Procession (until about 1700 ACE). The Procession of th e Equinoxes acts as an unforgeable clock dating this section of the Book of Formation 4000 plus or minus 800 y ears ago (not anywhere within the range of medieval times). 42 The Sunset includes all information on the letters in the Sefer Yetzirah . 43 “The Wall” is an Atziluthic meditation on the letters taken two at a time. Each pair has its own distinct vibrational signature when it becomes manifest in the World of B’riyah, and is activated by the vowels in the Sefirah Knowledge (of the Ayn )/The First. 44 It is the tension of this battle that produces the Creation. 45 “Fire lifts the Water” is an image comparable to Chi Chi (“After Completion”), the sixty-third hexagram in the Chinese I Ching ( Book of Changes ). There are the many similarities between the Sefer Yetzirah and the Shuo Kua , the eighth and oldest wing of the I Ching . The translation of the entire Shuo Kua is available in Appendix K. 46 Isaiah 41:8. 47 Torah B’reshith 15:6. 48 This is a reference to the Atziluthic Torah , by which the Creation was made."}]
