ZOHAR For the Quabbalists, the AIN-SOPH is the absolute, Supreme Deity, the one eternal state of being, and symbolized by the circle, within this circle all worlds are ma nifested, thus creating all this is inside and all that is outside. In the process of creation, the manifest life of th e AIN-SOPH proceeds from the circumference to the c enter, and establishes a point. The two dimensional symbol is now shown as plat no. 1 . With the circle as the first limitation defining th e limits of space and the second limitation as the point, a universal germ, AIN-SOPH no longer shines through space, but rather upon space from an established first point. The ZOHAR further establishes 40 rates of vibration s or subdivisions of the manifested AIN-SOPH, repre sented symbolically as concentric circles within the prima ry circle of the limits of space. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" For informational purposes, the 40 circles of creat ion from the AIN-SOPH, are divided into 4 great cir cles of world chains, consisting of ten subdivisions each. The fo ur world chains (A, B ,C, D) are called: A l- l0, Atziluth or Boundless world of Divine Name s; B l- l0, Briah, or Archangelic world of Creations; C l- l0, Yetzirah or Hierarchal world of Formations ; D l- l0, Assiah or Elemental world of Substances. Now, these four world chains between the great circ le and the central point do not concern us for the purpose of the celestial tetrahedron. What is important is that th e ZOHAR pre-establishes two additional circles betw een the great circle and the first subdivision called Atziluth. T hus, the internal, unmanifested nature of AIN-SOPH is divided into three parts represented by the concentric circle sp aces respectively between the outer circle (x) as f ollows: X to X-l, AIN, the vacuum of pure spirit; X-l to X-2, AIN-SOPH, the limitless and Boundless; X-2 to X-3, AIN-SOPH-AUR, the limitless Light. Thus, from the outer circle (x) to the central poin t, are three circles representing the three in one unity of the unmanifested AIN-SOPH. From this unmanifested trini ty comes the manifested worlds represented by 40 gr eat subdivisions. The ZOHAR symbol for the celestial te trahedron is now as shown with each successive circ le being a limit on the preceding. As stated by Manley P. Hall,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"It should be borne in mind that in the beginning t he Supreme Substance, AIN, alone permeated the area of the circle; the inner rings had not yet come into manif estation. As the Divine Essence concentrated Itself , the rings X 2 and X 3 became apprehensible, for AIN SOPH is a lim itation of AIN, and AIN SOPH AUR, or Light, is a st ill greater limitation. Thus the nature of the Supreme One is considered to be threefold, and from this th reefold nature the powers and elements of creation were reflected into the Abyss left by motion of AIN SOPH towards t he center of Itself. The continual motion of AIN SOPH towards the center of Itself resulted in the establishment of the dot in the circle. The dot was called God, as being the su preme individualization of the Universal Essence. T he name of this point is I AM, called by the Hebrews Eheieh an d it controls and contains all other emanations.\" Further the central point represents the crown or K ether of the Sephirothic Tree. There are four trees , one in each of the four world chains. The central point controls a nd contains all the 39 circles within the four worl d chains which it encloses. Thus, the ZOHAR establishes the concept o f the three forces of the trinity outside the centr al dot as unmanifested universe and the central dot as a sepa rate world unto itself consisting of 40 subdivision s divided over 4 world chains of manifested universe. This cosmic seal set forth in the ZOHAR is the esot eric wisdom of one of the three books of the Quabba la. Despite the ravings of H.P. Blavatsky against the Hebrew al phabet as essentially phallic and the medieval book s of the Quabbala as altered to suit Christianity, she unequ ivocally accepts the ZOHAR as representing the Hind u cosmology described in The Secret Doctrine as follo ws: \"The entire scheme is in the Chaldean Book of Numbe rs, and even in the ZOHAR, if one only understood t he meaning of the apocalyptic hints. First comes Ain-S oph, the \"Concealed of the Concealed,\" then the Poi nt, Sephirah and the later Sephiroth; then the Atzilatic World, a World of Emanations that gives birth to three oth er worlds: (the first, the Briatic World or World of Creation), cal led the Throne, the abode of pure Spirits; the seco nd, the World of Formation, or Yetziratic, the habitat of the Angels who sent forth the Third, or World of Action, the Asiatic World, which is the Earth or our World; and yet it is said of it that this world, also called Olam ha-Kliphot h, containing the (six other) Spheres,Galgallim), and matter, is the residence of the \"Prince of Darkness.\" This is as c learly stated as can be; for Metatron, the Angel of the second or Br iatic World, means Messenger, Angel, called the gre at Teacher; and under him are the Angels of the Third World, or Yetziratic, whose ten and seven classes are the Se phiroth,of whom it is said that \"they inhabit and vivify this world as Essential Entities and Intelligences, whos e correlatives and contraries inhabit the third or Asiatic World.\" These \"Contraries\" are called the \"Shells,\" (Kliph oth), or demons, who inhabit the seven habitations called Sheva Hekh aloth, which are simply the seven zones of our glob e. Their prince is called in the Kabala Sammael, the Angel o f Death, who is also the seducing serpent Satan; bu t that Satan is also Lucifer, the bright angel of Light, the Light- and Life-bringer, the \"Soul\" alienated for the Holy Ones, the other angels, and for a period, anticipating the time whe n they would have descended on Earth to incarnate i n their turn.\" In, conclusion, the l4th century ZOHAR repeating th e wisdom of the ancient Chaldean Book of Numbers, c learly defines the unmanifested universe of the celestial tetrahedron as a trinity of three concentric circle s localizing a central dot, which dot in turn, represents the mani fested universe and its subdivisions. 2. CIRCLE-TRIANGLE A geometrical evolution has occurred from the early representation of the unmanifested world as a symb ol of three circles and a center point. For example, G.I. Gurdj ieff in explaining his law of reciprocal maintenanc e sets forth a series of twelve essence groups called the Trogoant oegocrat. At the top of the ladder he represents th e absolute or unmanifested deity as a circle, with an inscribed t riangle and a central dot. Likewise, the Quabbalist s represent the first three Sephiroth, Kether, Binah and Hochma as a triangle, represented by the letter 'shin', and c ircumscribed by a circle. Also, all the major books of theosophy repr esents the triple aspects of Deity with a triangle, symbolic of the higher unity of Manas-Buddha-Atman. In fact, every exoteric religion has evolved the sy mbol of the three aspects of Deity into a circle, i nscribed with a triangle and central dot, replacing the three circl es of the Zohar with a central triangle as follows:"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 3. GOD AS TRINITY. The reason for the evolution of the three circles i nto the triangle is that upon recognition of the th ree aspects of God - Absolute- Ain-Soph etc., the triangle is more geo metrically representative. Thus, the outer circle s till symbolizes the limits of space in which the deity acts but the deity itself becomes represented by the triangle. The triad or triangle has become a universal exoteric symbol of deity in its three aspects. Again this took historical time to achieve because the evolution of exoteric religions, also progresse d in stages. The first cultural epoch or first religion represented by the Hindu-Brahman can be thought of as a plurali ty of gods in unity as a circle. The second cultural epoch repres ented by the Persian-Zoroastrian, can be thought of as the emergence of Duality, as Ahura-Madza and Ahrihman. Not until the third cultural epoch as represented b y the Egyptian-Chaldean, do we see the first emergence of the three aspects of god as a trinity or triangle. Thenceforth, god can be represented as a trinity in all religion s as follows: RELIGION TRINITY Hindu Brahma Shiva Vishnu Christian Father Son Holy Spirit Hebrew Kether Hochma Binah Egyptian Osiris Isis Horus Persian Ahura-Mazda Vohuman Asha Vahishta Scandinavian Thor Freya Odin Druid Taulec Fan Mollec Babylonian Anu Ea Bel R Steiner explains this evolution of deity as unity then duality then trinity as follows: \"The first period, the primeval Indian, developed a religion that seems like an inner lighting-up, an inner repetition, in ideas and feelings, of the very first period, wh en sun and moon were still bound up with the earth. The spirit who, in the first condition of the earth, in the primeva l mist, connected himself with all angels, archange ls, high gods, and spiritual being, was for Indian consciousness summe d up as a single high individuality under the name of Brahm or"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Brahma. This first post-Atlantean culture recapitul ated in the spirit what had happened earlier. It is a repetition of the first epoch of the earth, in its inner aspect. \"Now let us look at the second cultural period. In the principles of light and darkness we have the re ligious consciousness of the primeval Persian period. The g reat initiate saw an opposition between two beings, one of the which was personified in the sun and the other in t he moon. Ahura Mazdao or Ormuzd, the Light-aura, is the being whom the Persians venerated as the highest god. Ahr iman is the evil spirit, the representative of all the beings who belonged to earth-plus-moon. The religion of the Pe rsians is a remembrance of the second epoch of the earth. \"In the third cultural epoch, man had to say to him self, \"In me are the forces of the sun and of the m oon; I am a son of the sun and a son of the moon. All the forces of the sun and of the moon appear as my father and my mother.\" Thus we have UNITY in the primeval past as the atti tude of the Indian; while the DUALITY that appeared with the separation of the sun is reflected in the religion of the Persians; and in the religious views of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, Assyrians, and Babylonians we find the t rinity that appeared in the third cultural epoch. T rinity appears in all religions of the third period, and in Egypt is exemplified in Osiris, Isis and Horus.\" Of course, the Hindu and Persian had a trinity in t heir esoteric cosmology, but these were not reveale d by the Vedas and Manes, respectively, until after the establishm ent of the Egyptian trinity. 4. LAW OF THREE Now, the triangle represents everything with a thre efold nature and as such, its possibilities of repr esentation are infinite. However, we do not want to confuse the tr iangle as unmanifested deity with the triad as mani fested in the created universe. The celestial tetrahedron is the three aspects of deity unmanifested and represented , for now, as a triangle. The manifestations of deity in the create d world are also threefold such as the triads of th e primary colors, the equilateral triangle in Masonry, triad of sun, moon and earth, etc. However, the latter triads are manifestations of the law of three in physical, created universe of n ature and do not concern us in discussion of the ce lestial tetrahedron. However, an explanation of this fundam ental occult law will help later in explaining how deity contains within itself the three forces, universally recogni zed as the occult trinity. The medieval Christians were the first to reveal as an exoteric symbol the principal of the law of thr ee. In an effort to explain in an appropriate symbol the Christian d octrine of the triune nature of God as Father, Son and Holy Ghost as separate, yet one unity, many European churches (built by anti-Catholic masons of course) display t he following symbol of God as trinity. Here we see the Father, Son and Holy Ghost separate d as three circles but connected by two aspects of two forces called EST and Non-EST. These represent the active and passive forces. In other similar symbols, we se e reference to a third force called the neutralizing force. Tog ether, these three forces, active, passive and neut ralizing, represent the three aspects of Deity unmanifested. As manifes ted, we need a fourth resultant combining the three into the matter of physics. Although the trinity of three forces appear in nume rous esoteric occult teachings such as the Salt, Su lphur and Mercury of Alchemy, no clear exoteric explanation i s given until the publication of The Secret Doctrin e in l888 by H.P. Blavatsky and later In Search of the Miraculou s by P.D. Ouspensky in l949. In the latter, G.I. Gu rdjieff explains the law as follows: \"Every phenomenon, on whatever scale and in whateve r world it may take place, from molecules to cosmic , is the result of the combination or the meeting of three d ifferent and opposing forces. One force, or two for ces recognized by modern science as positive and negative, alone c an never produce a phenomenon. The presence of a th ird force is always necessary. The first may be called active or positive; the second, passive or negative and the third, neutralizing. The first two forces are obvious to a ny person as positive or negative, male-female, goo d-evil, etc. However, the third neutralizing force is difficult of observation. \"Also, all these forces are just names for what in reality appears as all three forces are equally act ive, passive and neutralizing only in their meeting points and only in relation to one another at a given moment in tim e. For example, the element carbon is much more active in the organ ic world than it is in the mineral world as is sili con more active in the formation of the earth's crust than it is in the organic world. \"The relationship of the three forces to the trinit y is that the three forces acting together form a t rinity which produces a new phenomenon. Thus, the three in one, when manifested form a fourth complete whole as mat ter and subdivisions, thereof: This concept is the essence of the celestial tetrahedron, the three forces as t rinity produce a fourth, manifested as matter, the first subdivision of material, created and physical universe which c an be counted, weighed, built upon, lifted and observed. The tetra hedron represents the three forces as trinity of go d (spirit) and the fourth as matter. Further, Gurdjieff explains: \"The four aspects or states of every substance have definite names."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"When a substance is the conductor of the first or t he active force it is called 'carbon,' and, like th e carbon of chemistry, it is designated by the letter C. When a substance is the conductor of the second or the passive force, it is called 'oxygen,' and, like the oxygen of chemistry, it is designated by the letter O. When a substance is the conductor of the third or n eutralizing force, it is called 'nitrogen,' and lik e the nitrogen of chemistry, it is designated by the letter N. When a substance is taken without relation to the f orce manifesting itself through it, it is called 'h ydrogen,' and, like the hydrogen of chemistry, it is designated by the letter H. The active, the passive, and the neutralizing force s are designated by the figures l, 2, 3. and the su bstances by the letters C, O, N, and H.\" Although the basic concept of the law of three is a ncient, the modern notation of C-O-N-H used by Gurd jieff was most likely borrowed from Madame H.P.B. in The Secr et Doctrine. She says, \"The numbers 3 and 4 are respectively male and fema le, spirit and matter and their union is the emblem of life eternal in spirit on its ascending arc and in matte r as the ever resurrecting element by procreation a nd reproduction ... The former (the 3) is invisible (as spirit) and the latter (the 4) is on the plane of objective pe rception (as matter). This is why all the matter of the universe, when an alyzed by science to its ultimates, can be reduced to four elements only C-O-N-H; and why the three primaries, the noum ena of the four, or graduated spirit or force have remained a terra incognita.\" In conclusion, God as Trinity, represented as an eq uilateral triangle, for exoteric purposes revealed as the triple aspect of deity, while for esoteric purposes is con cealed as the ancient law of three. 5. SEPHIROTH TREE The principal of three as Spirit and unmanifested c osmos passing into four as matter and manifested co smos has its prima-facie origin in Western occultism in the SEPH ER YETZIRAH book of the quabbalah. The esoteric sym bol of the Quabbalah is the Sephiroth Tree of Life (from K ircher)."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"From the AIN SOPH represented, as before, by the O circle beyond and above all number, emanate a succe ssion of ten Sephiroth. Do the first three Sephiroth, shown as Kether, Bina h and Holhmah, represent the trinity as Law of Thre e? Consulting some Quabbalahistic sources we find: IBN Geberol saying, \"The triad is the root of everythi ng\"; the Idrah Zootah says; \"The Ancient, whose name be bles sed! has three heads which are yet one head\"; and I ssac Myer saying, \"The triad of the Ancient Quabbalah is Keth er, the Father; Binah, the Holy Spirit or Mother; a nd Hokhomah, the Word or Son; which three are distinguished from the other Sephiroth and are called the 'upper holy triad' and together form the Intellectual World (A'Tzeel atic world) and govern the head.\" This upper holy triad has always been distinguished from the lower triads emanating from the lower sev en Sephiroth, because in fact, the Quabbalahists inten d this first triad to represent the trinity. From K ether, emanates the opposition, the female and male, the negative and p ositive principals. Together, the three are one, in unity. How then does the three as trinity pass into the fo ur as matter in the Quabbala? From the third Sephir oth Hokhomah, emanates the fourth sephiroth known as HESED. The Z ohar says that from the breast of Hokhomah, the wor d, the divine son emanated six principals or Sephiroth cal led the \"Sephiroth of Construction\". Issac Myer say s these symbolize the dimensions of matter, the six sides o f the entire universe, the six days of building (fr om Genesis), be it an atom or universe, as represented in the three di mensions of Length, Breadth, Depth, and the positiv e and negative poles of each of these. These six dimensions of the material or manifested cosmos are represented as t he six sided cube with a numerical Hebraic script value of 72. Thus, the trinity as the upper holy triad of the fi rst three sephiroth pass into the fourth sephiroth HESED and its emanations as the constructed or manifested world r epresented by the dimensions of matter. Another interesting way we see the three pass into the four as represented in the Zohar is by the grea t name of the Tetragrammaton represented in the name of God writt en as Jehovah (YHVH and pronounced as ADONI). The Zohar says, \"There are four lights! Three of them a re concealed and one is revealed. The letter of Kether if Y-Yod, of Binah H. Heh and of Hokhmah which is a complete symbol in itself of the name of God as representative of the trinity. However, a fo urth letter is always added to the name of God maki ng the complete Tetragrammaton of four letters. The letter H is added at the end, thus YHVH. The reason for t his is explained by Issac Myer as the last letter H of thi s ineffable name being always applied to the six lo wer and last Sephiroth represented, as above state, in the Fourt h Sephiroth of Construction, HESED. The first three sephiroth represented the upper holy triad in the first three letters Y-H-V and the lower Sephiroth of Construct ion in the fourth letter repeated as H as HESED. Taken together, we h ave the sacred holy name of Jehovah, the Tetragramm aton, as YHVH expressed as three letters plus one making the four letter name of God. This mystery of the holy name as representative of the principal of three passing into the four has be en aptly commented upon. \"If thou art attentive to that most holy name of the Deity (that is the Tetragrammaton or four lettered name YHVH) as found explained in the myste ries of mysteries, thou beholdest, a name of three letters, thou of four symbols, one of them a twin, being written twice, that is, the H-HED. If anybody examines them , he can see that the very name represents both one and three, t ruly each pointing to the oneness of the substance, so that it shows the trinity of persons.\" The first and second letters form YH, the second an d third letters form HV and the third and fourth le tters VH, joined together they form the one great name YHVH. Thus, the three letters (of the trinity) form a uni ty of four (the constructed world of matter). 6. TETRAHEDRON AS MATTER"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" The tetrahedron like, the first circle of the ZOHAR , is the first subdivision to divide the universe i nto two parts: all of the universe inside the system and all the unive rse outside its system. Buckminister Fuller has exa mined the tetrahedron as the sum of the forces of the law of three in several ways. In solving the relationship of plane geometry and G alileo's parallelogram of forces, he thought of the basic mathematical problem of ships on a collision course on the ocean. One ship was drawn on a plane runnin g at a certain velocity in a given direction. Multiply its weight times its velocity and make a length of a l ine called a vector. Then likewise, vector the other ship. Then, make two other lines parallel with the first set o f two vectorial lines and make a parallelogram with the first two v ectors. Next, make a line diagonal in the parallelogram fro m the point of collision to its diagonally opposite corner. The external equidistant extension of the diagonal of t he parallelogram was called the resultant of forces . From this diagram the two ships after collision are supposed to go in the same somewhere direction for some mile s. Of course, this does not really happen after the collision bec ause one ship sinks to the bottom of the ocean. Now what Fuller recognized was that modern science did not recognize what we said earlier about the ne utralizing force. The third force is very difficult for the av erage person to see. Although, science grasped the idea of the fourth force or resultant, (our hydrogen as the combinatio n of the three forces), it did not grasp or recogni ze the third force or nitrogen principal. Fuller found that in reality four forces are operating on the ships at sea. Two forces accelerate conically together, rising from the earth, plus gra vity, plus the resultant. So when the two ships col lide, they really want to rise up against gravity, and they could if they had enough speed, but instead they sink or go a few yards in the direction of the resultant of forces. The patte rn of real forces looks very much like a music stan d, three vectorial legs spread out with a fourth vertical vector."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" Fuller shows the creation of the first subdivision of universe as a tetrahedron in plat no. 1 . The ba ll on the string is anything. The string however long is the force of g ravity as the combined mass attraction exerted upon one by all the stars in universe. It can move in any direction but it cannot get out of or absolutely away from the u niverse, so the single string is always attached to it. Turning the mass attractions of the stars into two hemispheres, those to the left and those to the rig ht. We find itself like a ping pong ball suspended in the middle of a one string fiddle with two restraints. It can still move but only on a plane perpendicular to the string, in circles, or cloverleaves, etc. With three restraints, It moves only as if in the m iddle of drum head and in a line perpendicular to t he plane of the drum head or web triangle. With one restraint, the ball was moving omnidirectionally and multidimensio nally. With two restraints, it was moving in a plane and with t hree restraints, only in a line. Finally, with four restraints, the ball is immobilized and represents a minimum system. Although restrained from directional motion, the ce nter ball can still create or move as the center do t in the ZOHAR represented 39 subdivisions of influences. The ball can still turbine, rotate, and precess locally in space without altering the geometric position at volume center of the celestial tetrahedron from whose four corners the four vectors of restraint were imposed. It can rotate in place a round an axis and that axis can incline at many ang les like a gyroscope top without altering its volumetric cente r. The tetrahedron is a triangularly faceted polyhedro n of four faces. It is unique as the minimum system . All matter of physical universe, as manifested, is in the primary form of a tetrahedron. Modern science recognizes t his in organic chemistry, mineralogy and crystallography. 7. PYTHAGORAS Pythagoras knew how the law of three produces the f ourth as matter or form. From his travels, he learn ed the Hindu, Persian and Egyptian systems of esoteric and exoter ic knowledge. He was also initiated into most if no t all then existing mystery schools. He taught his students th at \"all things consist of three\" and \"establish the triangle and the problem is two-thirds solved\". Besides establishing the famous geometrical theorem, the tetractys, the five (platonic) solids and the musical geometry of the spheres, he established how number is related to form ."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" The dot was the monad or number l; The line, the po wer of 2; the triangle, the power of 3 and the soli d tetrahedron, the power of 4. Note, when he established the solid or primary matter as the fourth power, he did not use the cube (the traditional ancient symbol of Earth) as the fo rm, he used the tetrahedron. He knew how the three forces together formed the first solid dimension. I would like to k now the results of an investigation of the karmic r elationship between Pythagoras and B. Fuller, either as reincarnation or channel. Gurudas in his first book on Vibrational Healing states that B. Fuller recei ved channeled information (from the music of the spheres, no doub t). What Euclid was to geometry for the past two millen niums, Fuller will be to the future millenniums. 8. TETRAHEDRON AS PRIMARY ATOM-EVENT B. Fuller further examines the tetrahedron as an en ergy event comprising the law of three. An open ended triangle can be considered as one ene rgy event consisting of our three forces of action, reaction and resultant. Two such tripartite vector spirals or op en triangles, one positive and one negative, combin e to form the tetrahedron. One set of three vector open triangle groups corres ponds to the proton (with its electron and anti-neu trino) and the other set of three vector triangle groups correspon ds to the neutrino (with its positron and neutrino) . Each of these groups is identified by nuclear physics as one-half Plank's constant or one-half spin or one-half quan tum."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"When brought together, these two sets of three vect or groups form the six edges of the tetrahedron whi ch is the conceptual unit of one energy quantum or atom. Thus, Fuller establishes the Law of Three (active, passive and resultant forces) in two sets as constr ucting the primary atom or element as a tetrahedronal form. (S ee Plat no. 2 for illustration.) 9. CONCLUSION - HARDLY Having established: (l) the ancients represented th e three aspects of deity as an equilateral triangle ; (2) the deity as a triangle represented the unmanifested spirit in its three aspects; (3) the law of three represented th e esoteric version of the three aspects of Deity as active, passive an d neutralizing forces inherent in all matter; (4) t he deity as triangle transforms into the tetrahedron, as three becomes f our and spirit becomes matter; (5) spirit and matte r as four in tetrahedron is the first subdivision of matter; (6) Fuller established the tetrahedron as the special form of the primary atom event. Therefore, using the isotropic law of \"as above, so below,\" since in the microcosm, the atom is formed as tetrahedron, so in the macrocosm, the celestial sph ere is formed as the celestial tetrahedron. (Thus, the name of this exercise.) However, this symmetry does not work. We cannot rep lace the primary First Circle with primary first tr iangle. That is why the tetrahedron should not be thought of as universe of deity but as the First Subdivision of universe as our familar zohar circle.."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" The scientific reasons for this are at least twofol d. First, although the tetrahedron is the first pri me volume in universe with a unique domain, it does not have a n ucleus. As Fuller shows, a prime volume is differen t from a generalized regenerative system. Generalized regene rative systems have a nucleus and prime volumes do not. There are only three prime volumes: tetrahedron, octahedr on and icosahedron. Prime volumes are characterized exclusively by external structural stability. Thus as a structure of cosmic hierarchy, the tetrahedron has the structural stability befitting its lofty status, but no center , and we cannot have a representation of deity with no center - this is blasphemy. (Actually, inside a tetrahedron comprise d of four tangent spheres, there is no central sphe re but there is a hole or curved convex space in the shape of an octa hedron. So something could fit inside here). Second, the tetrahedron alone, consisting of only f our vectors of restraint can still move in several directions. In a nuclear domain of four close packed spheres, the te trahedron system is stable as in Plat no. 3 . Howev er, in a celestial domain of four vectors of restraint defin ing an inside-outside domain of universe: (l) each of the four corners can be pushed, thus turning the tetrahedron inside out in four directions (concave-convex) or (2) the entire tetrahedron can rotate in a 360 direction (precess locally within its celestial sphere). As shown in P lat no. 4 ,it takes a minimum of twelve vectors of restraint to immobil ize the center ball of the tetrahedron , to keep it from motion to turbine, rotate or precess. Each of the four corner s of the tetrahedron need three vectors of restrain t to lock the four corners in place."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Thus, to have a celestial tetrahedron as permanent and immobile, locked in place, we need to have \"fou r external star foci events\" restrained by three sets of vector ten sions each. \"The cohering integrity of universe is manifest to us by consideration of the celestial advantage poin t from which our four central restraints were mounted to prevent local in position twist and torque, each of the fo ur corner tensional restraints will have to be multiplying re placed by three restraints, all springing from thre e external points at each of the four tetrahedral corners; and each of t he three tensions from any one of the four corners must cross the others triangularly and be attached tangentially to the ball at the center.\" (B. Fuller) This concept is represented in the following diagram as a tensegrity tetrahedron ."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Now, our search here has not been to find how to re strain the center of a tetrahedron or restrain the center dot of the Zohar symbol. It has been to define a celestial tet rahedron which we know somehow must exist in fact, but we became mixed up in twelve vectors of restraint as n ecessary to define a tetrahedron that evolved forme rly with four vectors of restraint. Now, we know that to have a celestial tetrahedron, it must be defined by four external star foci event s, located somewhere in our celestial sphere, from which each of the four corners must project three sets each of tension vectors of restraint!! Now, before we locate and define the four corners o f the celestial tetrahedron, we should ask if we st ill have a circle circumscribing the triangle or tetrahedron as or if now after the analysis, the tetrahedron is outside and the circle inside as . 10. CELESTIAL SPHERE What is the external shape of the perimeter of univ erse? Is it the circle of the Zohar within which ci rcle our worlds are manifested or is it the triangle or tetrahedron within which we also know all can be separated int o inside and outside? We must keep in mind that the universe is expanding (after Hubbel) and space is curved (after Einstein). The latter would suggest an easy solution and end t he discussion here, but. Fuller also observed and defined a mathematical phe nomenon known as a geodesic. It is the most economi cal relationship between any two events. Just as a line is the shortest distance between two points on a p lane, a geodesic line is the shortest distance between any two point s on the outside of a sphere. A sphere composed of geodesic lines is called a geodesic sphere and includes all the pr incipals of tensegrity. Each line on the perimeter of the geodesic sphere d efines a great circle. A great circle is mapped whe n a regular polygon is rotated inside the sphere and the nodes of the polygon trace a circle on the sphere. For ex ample, we know that our celestial tetrahedron with only four vecto rs of restraint can still rotate in place. If we ro tate this tetrahedron,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"each of the four modes define four great circles on the geodesic sphere. Plat no. 5 shows the four gre at circles of the tetrahedron inscribed on the sphere, and the six gr eat circles of the octahedron and the 20 circles of the icoshedron. Likewise, for illustration, Plat 6 Plat No. 6 shows the many great circles of another geodesic."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Thus, it we spin the celestial tetrahedron inside t he celestial sphere, we can have it both ways. The external shape of the perimeter of universe is neither a circle nor t riangle, and we do not have to address the issue of which is first. The celestial sphere is a geodesic sphere defined b y the great circles of the inscribed polygon, which at a minimum is the four great circle celestial tetrahedron and a maximum, zillions of great circles tracing the ro tating star events of the Milky Way Galaxy! Thus, our familar Zohar tr iangle prevails as unity."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" Incorporated by synergy into our celestial sphere i s the concept of tensegrity. Fuller created the wor d and concept as a contraction of tensional - integrity. As defined by Fuller, \"tensegrity defines a structural relatio nship principal in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitel y closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional beh aviors of the system. All structures, from the solar system to th e atom, properly understood, are tensegrity structu res. Universe is omnitensional integrity.\" Thus, space is curved (after Einstein) because the celestial sphere is composed of the domain of the s uccessive great circles. Universe is expanding (after Hubbel) becau se the tensegrity of the celestial sphere provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or c oming apart. In conclusion, the compound curvature geodesic stru cture of the celestial sphere employs the tensegrit y principal and remember, the four corners of the celestial tet rahedron need to be replaced to form the tensegrity tetrahedron. 11. A MODEL In the third degree of masonic initiation, a scene is related wherein King Solomon is apprehensive abo ut the safety and whereabouts of his master builder, Hiram Abiff. To search for him, Solomon orders three workers to go each in the direction of the four cardinal points of univer se. This allegory has always fascinated me because the three workers in the four directions (3 x 4) resembles th e three vectors of restraint at the four corners of the celestial tetrahedron. This allegory will be the working model to define a nd locate the four corners of the celestial tetrahe dron which need to be replaced by four sets of three vectors of res traint. The \"four external star foci events\" are th e four cardinal"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"points of the world referred to by all ancients. Th ese become fixed points on the celestial tensegrity sphere which radiate three vectors each through space down to th e four fixed points (signs) located in the zodiac a s Leo, Taurus, Scorpio, and Aquarius. The center ball of the tensegrity tetrahedron is re placed by the band of the zodiac, now locked in pla ce by the twelve vectors of restraint as was the center ball in the figure on Page l3. The four cardinal points of the \"world\" need to be located outside the band of the zodiac, so a distin ction needs to be made between the four cardinal po ints and the four fixed signs of the zodiac. Within the band of the zodiac is another sphere or circle of the ZOHAR , in which deity manifests logos in our world of sun, planets, moon, comets and organic life. l2. SPIRITUAL HIERARCHIES The celestial hierarchies were first introduced to western occultism through St. Paul the apostle at t he Greek school. His most intimate pupil, Dionysius the Aeropagite u sed the following terms in descending order from th e deity: Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominions, Mights, Pow ers, Archai, Archangels, and Angels. The Hindu Rish is spoke of spiritual hierarchies as did the Egyptians , Chaldeans and Gnostics. Ancient wisdom named the planets not as physical globes but for the spirit which resided there. Thus, the moon (angels); Mercury (archangel ); Venus (archai); sun (powers); Mars (mights); Jupiter (Dom inions) and Saturn (Thrones). The preceding orders relate to the planetary logos emanating through the seven planets of the ancients and do not concern us here. (The i nner circle of the Zohar.) Above the planetary spheres reside the domains of t he Seraphim and Cherubim. And in the creation of Sa turn (Thrones) form the triad of the first round. Rudolf Steiner explains as such in The Spiritual Hierarch ies: \"Before a system of Thrones, Cherubim and Seraphim comes about, it must first have been a solar system . This means a sun must have reached the stage when it cou ld unite itself again with its planets; then it can become peripheral. The sun itself becomes a zodiac. What w e have come to know as the exalted beings in the zo diac are remnants that have passed over to us from a previou s solar system. Seraphim, Cherubim and Thrones repr esent for us the highest hierarchy among divine beings becaus e they have already accomplished this development a s a solar system and have risen to an exalted rank of cosmic sacrificial service. We must picture the godhead as beyond the Seraphim. The (Seraphim) receive the plans for a ne w cosmic system from the divine trinity from whom t hey originated. The name Seraphim is always interpreted as referring to beings who receive the loftiest id eas and aims of a cosmic system from the trinity. \"The Cherubim, who belong to the next hierarchy, ha ve the task of elaborating in wisdom the aims and i deas of received from the gods. They are capable of transpo rting into workable plans what is indicated by the Seraphim. \"The Thrones, the third rank of the hierarchies, ha ve the task of putting into practice the lofty cosm ic thoughts, received by the Seraphim from the gods and pondered over by the Cherubim.\" The first and second threefold hierarchy is represe nted by Steiner as concentric circles shown in Plat No. 7. The purpose of the first and second triad is to com press their particular sphere of influence. Cosmic bodies such as suns and planets do not simply condense, spiritual beings have to bring about the condensation, the Ch erubim accomplished this task for the zodiac or animal cir cle. Steiner represented this process of evolution in th e following diagram Plat No. 8. The inner circle (t he center ball in our tetrahedron) represents the globe of the old su n (first round). The archangels sped outward in all directions from the center globe and spread spiritually into the co smos. The Cherubim where the beings who come to mee t the archangels. \"For the Cherubim, in fact, drew near, to begin with, from four sides\". These four sides w ere the primary four sets of three vectors restraints emanating fro m the four corners of the celestial tetrahedron. Th ey approached in shapes that could afterwards be represented as the four winged beasts (Ezekiel's vision) of the Bull, Eagle, Lion and Man. For Plat No. 8, the four fixed signs of the zodiac are Leo (Lion); Scorpio (Eagle); Taurus (Bull) and Aquarius (Water-man). Notice that along side each primary Ch erubim are secondary (later) zodiac signs which rep resents the four sets of three vectors restraints. As Steiner s ays: \"I have only spoken about four names of the zodiac. They represent the four principal expressions of t he Cherubim, but in reality each of these cherubic beings has to the right and the left of it a kind of follower or companion. Thus we have twelvefold forces belonging to the realm of the Cherubim.\" Thus, Steiner recognizes that beyond the Seraphim i s the threefold trinity of deity exactly similar to our zohar model of the threefold trinity as triangle or tetrahedron . In addition, he recognizes the primary sphere, of unmanifested deity as trinity and the manifested sphere of the S eraphim as manifested deity. Or put another way, th e trinity cannot manifest itself directly in our chain of worlds but can only do so in and through the manifest sphere of the Seraphim. The Seraphim and Cherubim do the work for the deity in our chain of worlds."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Steiner also recognizes the twelvefold nature of th e Zodiac as a result of the work of the Cherubim. T his fits very neatly with our twelvefold vectors of restraint man ifested through the four principal expressions of t he zodiac with its eight followers or companions of three zodiac s igns. Finally, the fixed signs of the zodiac represent th e four places where the four sets of three vectors attach themselves tangently to the center sphere of the celestial tet rahedron. From the four cardinal points or \"four external star foc i events\" emanate four sets of three vector restrai nts which attach tangently to the four fixed signs of the zodiac. Th us, the four cardinal points are located (somewhere ) on the surface of the celestial tensegrity geodesic sphere wholly outside the sphere of the zodiac. As far as the order of successive chains of cosmic creation is concerned, this did not proceed progres sively inward from the celestial tetrahedron. As previously state d, before a system of Seraphim, Cherubim and Throne s comes about, it must first have a solar system. The sun i tself can become a zodiac, dissolve into the cosmos and become a choir of celestial beings like the Seraphim and Che rubim. For this reason, the celestial tetrahedron d id not first begin as such. Through an evolution of suns and planets o ver four rounds only did the celestial tetrahedron become. As each successive order of spiritual hierarchies comp letes its assigned task, that order passes on in et ernity to higher orders and is likewise replaced by similar orders e volving upwards in the spiritual hierarchy. In each of the four rounds, successive orders of the spiritual hierarch ies move up and down the ladder of creation. The ce lestial path of the retiring Cherubim ascending as our tensional ve ctor strings becomes the four cardinal points on th e celestial geodesic sphere. The location of the four cardinal points is still a mystery to me, but I suggest the seven Rishis located in the Great Bear Constellation is one such external foci event. 13. CONCLUSION In conclusion, our spiritual geometry evolution beg ins with the ZOHAR symbol of the circle with centra l point as here. This circle represented the outer limits of creatio n (the Milky Way) by the Deity as within this circu mscribing circle all worlds are manifested. The central point or mon ad is the universal germ or seed creating the manif est worlds through the triple aspect of Deity represented by t he three inscribed circles as"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Later, the three circles of the Zohar are replaced by the Pythagorean triangle, with the point or mona d of the tetractys as center. Thus, (our zohar circle) becomes the occult symbol of the circumscribed cosmos of the Milky Way, inscr ibed by the Pythagorean triangle and the universal seed as mona d of the TETRACTYS"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" The triangle represents the forces of the Law of Th ree as active, passive and neutralizing, and as the three pass into four, as spirit passes into matter, the triangle be comes the tetrahedron as primary atomic event. With the introduction of Fuller geodesics, the cele stial sphere as circle is replaced with the compoun d curvature spherical tetrahedron. Although a good symbol, the spherical tetrahedron is not yet perfect because it is not fixed in space, it can still rotate, turbine and twist in pl ace. In order to immobilize the tetrahedron, it is necessary to fix each of the four corners with three vectors each of rest raint. This is accomplished by replacing the center point or monad with the twelvefold band of the zodiac. With each o f the twelve signs of the zodiac representing a vec tor of restraint, the twelve respective tangents stretch from each zo diac sign to the edge of the celestial sphere, lock ing the system is place as a completed spherical tensegrity tetrahedr on. Each of the four corners of the spherical tetra hedron are now represented in space by four star foci events whose four primary tangents run their course from the pe rimeter of the celestial sphere, through the spaces of the Milky W ay and attach themselves to the four fixed signs of the zodiac. The result is the spiritual geometric evolution of: (1) the circle now as a celestial tensegrity spher e enclosing the Milky Way; (2) the triangle now as a tensegrity tet rahedron with four fixed corners as star foci event s and (3) the central point now as the band of the zodiac with tw elve vector tangents extending from the zodiac in t welve directions through space to the edge of the celesti al sphere and attached at the four star foci events , locking the entire synergetic system in place, as shown in the frontis piece.

It derive s from the Hermetic conclusion of the universal uni ty of the manifest world. The classical formulation was set forth in the seco nd verse of the EMERALD TABLET (in Latin, the TABUL A SAMARGDINA and its Alchemical sybmol )attributed to the thrice great Hermes Trismegistus, as follows: That which is above is like to that which is below and that which is below is like to that which is ab ove, to accomplish the miracles of the one thing. TABULA SMARAGDINA HERMETIS . It is true, certain, and without falsehood, that wh atever is below is like that which is above; and th at which is above is like that which is below: to accomplish the one wonderful work. As all things are derived from the One Only Thing, by the will and by the word of the One Only One who created it in His Mind, so all things owe t heir existence to this Unity by the order of Nature, and can be improved by Adaptation to that Mind. Its Father is the Sun; its Mother is the Moon; the Wind carries it in its womb; and its nurse is the E arth. This Thing is the Father of all perfect things in the world. I ts power is most perfect when it has again been cha nged into Earth. Separate the Earth from the Fire, the subtle from t he gross, but carefully and with great judgment and skill.. It ascends from earth to heaven, and descends again , new born, to the earth, taking unto itself thereb y the power of the Above and the Below. Thus the splendor of the w hole world will be thine, and all darkness shall fl ee from thee. This is the strongest of all powers, the Force of a ll forces, for it overcometh all subtle things and can penetrate all that is solid. For thus was the world created, and rare combinations, and wonders of many kinds are wr ought. Hence I am called HERMES TRISMEGISTUS, having maste red the three parts of the wisdom of the whole worl d.

Nowhere is it better said about this great law than in MEDITATIONS ON THE TAROT (1985 English edition) : \"Since at the root of the diversity of phenomena th eir unity is found, in such a way that they are at one and the same time different and one, they are neither identical nor heterogeneous but are analagous in so far as th ey manifest their essential kinship... The formula of analogy applied in space is the basi s of TYPOLOGICAL symbolism, that is, of symbols exp ressing CORRESPONDANCES between PROTOTYPES above and their manisfestations below: the formula of analogy applied in time is the basis of MYTHOLOGICAL symbol ism, that is, of symbols expressing correspondances between ARCHETYPES in the past and their manisfesta tions in the present. these two categories of symbo lism, based on alalogy, constitute through their mutual r elationship a cross\". In the next chapters, we will be dealing with the a ction of this law in SPACE, as topology, and not in time, as mythology. In space, this law manifests itself on l evels of correspondance from the archetypal world d own to the physical world. In space, this law manifests in a s eptenary evolution of periodicity, exoterically as sound, discoverable in the laws of music and esoterically, as light. The electromagnetic spectrum of the worl d ether manifests as sound and light in a broad range of si nusoidal curves. For a sine curve, in uniform motio n, above the horizon is the same as below the horizon, only reve rsed in direction. The macrocosm above and the micr ocosm below. These esoteric light waves are the bearers o f the activity of the Spirits of Form, also called Elohim, Exusiai or Powers, who create the forms of this manifest wo rld. As Goethe said in his THEORY OF COLOR, \"If only the divergence of the yellow and blue is p roperly grasped, and if especially the deepening in to red, whereby the opposite colors lean together and unite in a th ird, is adequately studied, then assuredly a partic ularly mysterious manifestation will appear-a spiritual significance will be found underlying these two separated and op posed beings; and, if one sees them producing downwards the green and upwards the red, one can hardly refrain from t hinking of the creative activity there on earth and here in he aven, of the ELOHIM\" The underlying form of the manifest world, esoteric ally as light from the Elohim, is reflected in the septenary of the visible spectrum, exoterically as sound, in the sep tenary of the musical scale. From the unity of the one, there is an evolution in space of the diffusion, thru the perio dicity of the forces of the seven and the return to unity at a higher level in the twelve, the number of equilibrium. The conceptual model here is UNITY (1)--DIVERSITY (7) and a return to UNITY at a higher level (12). above - - - - - past_____________________________________future TIM E, MYTHOLOGY - - - - - below SPACE-TOPOLOGY THE LAW OF SEVEN 1. Septenary in Nature The septenary principle is observed everywhere in c osmos and is the fundamental law of Periodicity. As observed by Peter Bongus in Mysticae Numerum Significationis (1585): \"The number Seven,' says this learned author, has a wonderful property, for it neither begets nor is b egotten, as the rest are, by any of the numbers within ten, wherefo re philosophers resemble it to the ruler or governo r of all things, who neither moves nor is moved. Philolaus the Pytha gorean, nor ignoble author, testifies thus, and wri tes that the eternal God is permanent, void of motion, similar t o himself, and different from others; and Boetius h as a passage much to the same purpose. The idea of virginity had such a relation to the number Seven, that it was a lso named Pallas; and the Pythagoreans, initiated in her rite s, compare the virgin Minerva to that number, seein g she was not"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"born, but sprung from the head of Jupiter. God rest ed on the Seventh day, wherefore it is named Sabbat h, a word signifying rest. The Seventh petition of the Lord's Prayer is, deliver us from evil; because the numbe r Seven denotes rest, and all evil being removed from man, he rests in good; and farther, the seventh day or sabbath r epresents death, or the rest of the soul from worldly labours. In Se ven days after Noah entered the ark the flood began : in the Apocalypse Seven trumpets are mentioned: Job speaks of the visitation of six tribulations, which six s ucceeding days brought on him, but on the Seventh no harm cou ld touch the just: God blessed only the Seventh day , wherefore the number Seven is attributed to the Holy Ghost, w ithout whom there is no blessing. This St. John pro ves, when in the Apocalypse he calls the Seven horns and the Sev en eyes the Seven spirits of God. The fever left th e son of Regulas, according to St. John, at the Seventh hour . Elisha breathed Seven times on the dead man. Chri st after his resurrection feasted with Seven disciples; and Seve n brother were sent to baptise Cornelius. The Seven hairs of Sampson; Seven golden candlesticks: and in Leviticu s command was given to sprinkle the blood and oil S even times. The Seven stars in the bear; the Seven princ ipal angels who rule the world under God, and have charge of the Seven planets, as namely, Horophiel the spirit of S aturn, Anael the spirit of Venus, Zachariel of Jupi ter, Raphael of Mercury, Samael of Mars, Gabriel of the moon, and M ichael the spirit of the sun. The moon changes its form Seven times, and completes its course in twenty-eight day s, which is the sum of the number Seven, and all th e numbers under it. Josephus writes that a certain river in S yria is dry for six days, and full on the Seventh. Farther, the great artist did not only dignify the heavens, but he als o adorned with the number Seven his favourite creat ure man, who has seven inward parts, or bowels, stomach, heart, lungs, milt, liver, reins, and bladder; and seven e xterior, as head, back, belly, two hands, and two feet. There are sev en object of sight, as body, distance, figure, magn itude, colour, motion, and rest: and Seven species of colour, taki ng the two extremes of white and black, viz., yello w, sky-blue, green purple, and red. No one can without eating li ve after the Seventh day. Physicians reckon ten tim es Seven years to be the period of human life, which Hippocrates d ivides into Seven stages. The ancient lyre, used bo th by Orpheus and Amphion, had only Seven chords, answering, as i t is said, to the Seven gates of Thebes. Every Seve nth daughter, no son coming between, hath, by virtue of the number Seven as I imagine, a great power in ea sing the pains of child-birth: and every Seventh son, no dau ghter coming between, has the power of curing the s curvy and leprosy by the bare touch; so that diseases, incura ble by physicians, are curable by the virtue contai ned in the number Seven. A right-angled triangle is constitute d of the sides three, four, five, but three and fou r contain the right angle, which is perfection itself, and therefore th eir sum seven, must as a number be most perfect. Ev ery active body has three dimensions, length, breadth, and thicknes s, and these have four extremes, point, line, surfa ce, and solid, and these together make up the number Seven. Gurdjieff was the first occultist to call the septe nary principle, the Law of Seven. I have never seen the principle better explained than by him. (From In Search of th e Miraculous). \"The next fundamental law of the universe is the la w of seven or the law of octaves. \"In order to understand the meaning of this law it is necessary to regard the universe as consisting o f vibrations. These vibrations proceed in all kinds, aspects, and densities of the matter which constitutes the univ erse, from the finest to the coarsest; they issue from various sou rces and proceed in various directions, crossing on e another, colliding, strengthening, weakening, arresting one another, and so on. \"The principle of the discontinuity of vibration me ans the definite and necessary characteristic of al l vibrations in nature, whether ascending or descending, to develop not uniformly but with periodical accelerations an d retardations. This principle can be formulated stil l more precisely if we say that the force of the or iginal impulse in vibrations does not act uniformly but, as it were, becomes alternately stronger and weaker. The force of the impulse acts without changing its nature and vibrations dev elop in a regular way only for a certain time which is determined by the nature of the impulse, the medium, the condi tions, and so forth. But at a certain moment a kind of change takes place in it and the vibrations, so to speak, cease to obey it and for a short time they slow dow n and to a certain extent change their nature or direction; for exampl e, ascending vibrations at a certain moment begin t o ascend more slowly, and descending vibrations begin to descend more slowly. After this temporary retardation, both in ascending and descending, the vibrations again enter the form er channel and for a certain time ascend or descend uniformly up to a certain moment when a check in their developme nt again takes place. In this connection it is sign ificant that the periods of uniform action of the momentum are not e qual and that the moments of retardation of 'the vi brations are not symmetrical. One period is shorter, the other i s longer. \"In order to determine these moments of retardation , or rather, the checks in the ascent and descent o f vibrations, the lines of development of vibrations are divided into periods corresponding to the doubling or the halvi ng of the number of vibrations in a given space of time. \"Let us imagine a line of increasing vibrations. Le t us take them at the moment when they are vibratin g at the rate of one thousand a second. After a certain time the num ber of vibrations is doubled, that is, reaches two thousand."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"\"It has been found and established that in this int erval of vibrations, between the given number of vi brations and a number twice as large, there are two places where a retardation in the increase of vibrations takes pl ace. One is near the beginning but not at the beginning itself. The other occurs almost at the end. \"The laws which govern the retardation or the defle ction of vibrations from their primary direction we re known to ancient science. These laws were duly incorporated into a particular formula or diagram which has been preserved up to our times. In this formula the period in whic h vibrations are doubled was divided into eight une qual steps corresponding to the rate of increase in the vibrat ions. The eighth step repeats the first step with d ouble the number of vibrations. This period of the doubling of the v ibrations, or the line of the development of vibrat ions, between a given number of vibrations and double that number, is called an octave, that is to say, composed of ei ght. \"In the guise of this formula ideas of the octave h ave been handed down from teacher to pupil, from on e school to another. \"The seven-tone scale is the formula of a cosmic la w which was worked out by ancient schools and appli ed to music. \"A study of the structure of the seven-tone musical scale gives a very good foundation for understandi ng the cosmic law of octaves. \"Let us again take the ascending octave, that is, t he octave in which the frequency of vibrations incr eases. Let us suppose that this octave begins with one thousand v ibrations a second. Let us designate these thousand vibrations by the note do. Vibrations are growing, that is, their frequency is increasing. At the point where they r each two thousand vibrations a second there will be a second do, that is, the do of the next octave. \"The period between one do and the next, that is, a n octave, is divided into seven-unequal parts becau se the frequency of vibrations does not increase uniformly . \"The ratio of the pitch of the notes, or of the fre quency of vibrations will be as follows: \"If we take do as 1 then re will be 9/8, mi 5/4, fa 4/3, sol 3/2, la 5/3, si l5/8, and do 2. \"The differences in the acceleration or increase in the notes or the difference in tone will be as fol lows: between do and re 9/8 : 1 = 9/8 between re and mi 5/4 : 9/8 = 10/9 between mi and fa 4/3 : 5/4 = 16/15 increase retard ed between fa and sol 3/2 : 4/3 = 9/8 between sol and la 5/3 : 3/2 = 10/9 between la and si 15/8 : 5/3 = 9/8 between si and do 2 : 15/8 = 16/15 increase again retarded \"The differences in the notes or the differences in the pitch of the notes are called intervals. We se e that there are three kinds of intervals in the octave: 9/8, 10/9, and 16/15, which in whole numbers correspond to 405 , 400, and 384. The smallest interval 16/15 occurs between mi and fa and between si and do. These are precisely t he places of retardation in the octave. \"In relation to the musical (seven-tone) scale it i s generally considered (theoretically) that there a re two semitones between each two notes, with the exception of the i ntervals mi-fa and si-do, which have only one semi- tone and in which one semitone is regarded as being left out. \"In this manner twenty notes are obtained, eight of which are fundamental: do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do and twelve intermediate: two between each of the fo llowing two notes: do-re re-mi fa-sol sol-la la-si and one between each of the following two notes: mi-fa si-do \"But in practice, that is, in music, instead of twe lve intermediate semi-tones only five are taken, th at is one semitone between: do-re re-mi fa-sol sol-la"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"la-si \"Between mi and fa and between si and do the semito ne is not taken at all. \"In this way the structure of the musical seven-ton e scale gives a scheme of the cosmic law of 'interv als,' or absent semitones. In this respect when octaves are spoken of in a 'cosmic' or in a 'mechanical' sense, only t hose intervals between mi-fa and si-do are called 'intervals.' \"What precisely does happen at the moment of the re tardation of vibrations? A deviation from the origi nal direction takes place. \"All this and many other things can be explained wi th the help of the law of octaves together with an understanding of the role and significance of 'intervals' which c ause the line of the development of force constantl y to change, to go in a broken line, to turn round, to become its 'own opposite' and so on. \"Such a course of things, that is, a change of dire ction, we can observe, in everything. \"The law of octaves explains many phenomena in our lives which are incomprehensible. \"First is the principle of the deviation of forces. \"Second is the fact that nothing in the world stays in the same place, or remains what it was, everyth ing moves, everything is going somewhere, is changing, and ine vitably either develops or goes down, weakens or de generates, that is to say, it moves along either an ascending or a descending line of octaves. \"And third, that in the actual development itself o f both ascending and descending octaves, fluctuatio ns, rises and falls are constantly taking place.\" The laws of music are a mathematical analysis of th e laws of vibrations. Modern science says that ener gy is matter moving at a vibration rate of the velocity of light squared. Thus, a study of music is the study of th e universe of vibrations. The esoteric study of music is the law of seven consisting of tones, semi-tones, and absen t semi-tones or intervals. In this explanation of the esoteric law, Gurdjieff also states (about year 1915) that this law is ever ywhere the same and that light, heat, chemical, magnetic and other vibrations are subject to the law of seven. Has thi s esoteric observation been proved correct by modern science? For example, look at the visible light spectrum see n through the dispersing prism of Sir Newton. The p rism deflects the seven colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blu e, indigo and violet. Newton, himself, observed the correlation between the musical scale and the visible light spe ctrum. but, he went no further in exoteric publicat ion than his Optics. Taking a typical base note such as a C, the ratios of the frequencies of D, E, F, etc., may be taken i n the musical scale (first formulated by Pythagoras) as set forth above as 9:8, 5:4, 4:3, etc. The correspondence be tween the visible light scale and the musical scale is as set forth b elow: Using C as a base note of DO, the Pythagorean music al ratios produce the visible light spectrum. Do - C 1 : 1 Cycle / Sound 4.40 x 10'4 Red Re - D 9 : 8 4.95 x 10'4 Orange Mi - E 5 : 4 5.5 x 10'4 Yellow Fa - F 4 : 3 5.86 x 10'4 Green Sol- G 3 : 2 6.60 x 10'4 Blue La - A 5 : 3 7.33 x 10'4 Indigo Ti - B 15 : 8 8.25 x 10'4 Violet Do 2 : 1 Invisible One should observe that the correspondence holds up quite well. If valid for the visible light spectru m, the correspondence should also hold up for the non-visi ble electromagnetic spectrum from gamma rays to rad io waves. In fact, ours is a cosmos of radiation, the lengths of its waves continuously varying in length from v ery short (gamma) to very long (radio). However, radiation is not distributed continuously in a given region, bu t is concentrated into pellets called photons which have both wave and particle properties. Until the disco very of the prism by (Newton), our science did not conceive of visible light consisting of seven independent wave lengths of light, which in unity is white light. However, the occult scientists did and this correspondence is re flected in the seven notes of the musical scale. Another example of the correspondence of the septen ary principle is in the atomic world of the chemica l elements. Each atom is enclosed, like the layers of an onion, with SEVEN electron shells. As each successive she ll fills with free electrons, the chemical properties of the elem ents depend upon the number of electrons in the out ermost shell available for the chemical bonds."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"In addition, the chemical elements show a septenary relation in the periodic table of Mendeleev (1869) . As observed several years earlier in 1864 by J. Newlands, \"the difference between the number of the lowest member of a group (of the periodic table) and that immediately above it is 7; in other words, the eighth element startin g from a given one is a king of repetition of the first, like the eighth note of an octave in music\". So close yet so far. Going beyond the atomic world of correspondence to the molecular world of correspondence, we again fin d the septenary principle evident in the mineral kingdom of nature. Crystals are a three dimensional periodi c arrangement of atoms in molecular form dispersed symmetrically at a given point of space. There are 230 possible s pace groups of three dimensional crystal structure in symmetry. This number of total possible arrangements in spac e can be reduced to thirty-two crystal classes, which consis ts of structural forms such as prism, pyramid, dome , cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, etc. All crystal classes can be further reduced to SEVEN crystal systems whi ch contain all crystal classes as follows: Isometric 5 classes Tetragonal 7 classes Hexagonal 7 classes Trigonal 5 classes Orthorhombic 3 classes monoclinic 3 classes triclinic 2 classes 32 crystal classes Thus, the shape and structure of our solid earth sh ows a septenary periodicity. The universality of th e law of seven shows itself in the vibrations of visible light, th e invisible light of the electromagnetic spectrum, sound, color, atomic world of chemical elements, periodic table o f chemical elements and molecular world of mineral structure. The number of correspondence is as infinite as the cosmos itself and unimportant. What is important is to see this principle at work, in everything around us in the m anifested world, unlike the law of three which oper ates in the first instance in the unmanifested world and is more diff icult to recognize. 2. SEPTENARY IN MAN If there is any gnosis that a human should depart w ith in death from this planet, none is more importa nt than the principle of the law of seven as applied to man. The Madame H.P.B. in the Secret Doctrine shows beyo nd a doubt the septenary in man is a fundamental es oteric doctrine of antiquity. The Egyptians divided the sky by night into seven p arts, the heaven into seven parts, the forces of na ture into seven parts, the invisible forces of nature into seven el ementals and also, seven elements or souls to man ( from Gerald Massey). 1. KHAT - body 2. BA - soul of breath 3. KHABA - the shade 4. AKHU - intelligence or perception 5. SEB - ancestral soul 6. PUTAH - first intellectual father 7. ATMU - divine or eternal soul Another esoteric division given by H.P.B. is by F. Lambert (1887) and taken from hieroglyphics and The Egyptian Book of the Dead: 1. KHAT - physical body 2. ANKH - vital force 3. KA - astral body - sidereal man 4. ABHATY - animal soul - heart 5. BA - intellectual soul - intelligence 6. KHAIBIT - spiritual soul 7. KHU - divine spirit In reference to the Persian-Zoroastrian cultural ep och and system of knowledge, an article appeared in the early Theosophist, reprinted in Five Years of Theosophy s etting forth the seven principles in their man as f ollows: 1. TANWAS - body 2. USHTANAS - vital force 3. KEHERAS - aerial form 4. TEVISHIS - will, sentient consciousness 5. BOADHAS - animal soul"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"6. VRWANEM - soul, that is judged often death 7. FRAWASHEM - spirit - divinity The source is taken from the holy hymn book Avesta whose initiates were called the Magi. A footnote in the article is written by the editors declares that the ancient Chinese text I Ching wri tten some 1,200 years B.C. also references a septenary nature in ma n as follows: 1. KWEI 2. SHAN 3. KWEI SHAN 4. ZHING 5. PHO 6. KHI 7. HWUN With the founding of the Theosophical Society in 18 75, the occult doctrines of the Buddhist and Hindu East began to be published in the English language for the fir st time. Madame H.P.B. as messenger of the trans-Hi malayan Arhats decided it was the time in the Kaliyuga cycl e to make exoteric many of the former esoteric tena nts of the Secret Doctrine. This disclosure was desperately needed because west ern occultism suffered from schism and persecution from the Catholic Church since the beginning of the Christia n Councils in the third century. The essences were exterminated by the Romans the school and library of Alexandria after repeated razing, met its final demise in the year 641 by the Calif Omar. The only remains of the Gnostics is the Pistis Sophia. The Cathars burned at the stake by the Albigensian Crusade and the Knights Templar burned at the stake by King Philip of France. After the ho rrible death of Jacques de Molay in year 1314, the Temple of Sol omon was finally destroyed and western occultists w ent underground. The medieval Kabbalists and Alchemists , the esoteric Christian Rosicrucians and the mason ic lodges were all secret organizations hiding from the tortu re, vivisection and death by the Church. When these groups did go exoteric, only a shell remained of their spiritual impulse and their revealed knowledge was in symboli c or mandala form, inaccessible to the common man. Thank God and not the Church for the spiritual revival lead by t he Theosophical Society of the Nineteenth Century. First in the series of disclosures of the ARHAT doc trines was A.P. Sinnett's book Esoteric Buddhism wh ich set forth the principles as follows: 1. Body - RUPA 2. Vitality - PRANA or JIVA 3. Astral Body - LINGA SARIRA 4. Animal Soul - KAMA RUPA 5. Human Soul - MANAS 6. Spiritual Soul - BUDDHI 7. Universal Spirit - ATMA This division separates the seven principles into a lower quaternary which function on the astral and physical planes and a higher triad of undeveloped principles repres enting the future evolution of spirit in mankind. A s explained by Sinnett, the second principle of man, vitality, con sists of Prana or life force as matter in its aspec t as force. Bury the body after death, and its Jiva will attach itself t o the vegetation which springs above or the lower a nimal forms which evolves from its substance. Burn the body, an d indestructible Jiva flies back to the planet itse lf from which it was originally borrowed. The astral body is the etheric duplicate of the phy sical body, a sort of original design or template f or organic development and differentiation. It never leaves th e body except at death when it is disembodied for s everal days, and disperses into the astral world. The forth principle is translated as the body of de sire in its earthly aspect and vehicle of will in i ts spiritual aspect. Traditionally, this principle was the animal soul a s seat of animal desires which include the whole ra nge of human passions and was the last earthly principle. Starting with the fifth principle, we see the first of the spiritual qualities in man which are not ye t fully developed. This human soul is the seat of mind or intelligence . Sinnett relates the sixth principle is still in e mbryo and the seventh principle is the spark of the divine or god in all of us, which is the same for all humanity. The sixth principle may be called the vehicle of the seventh as well as the fourth principle is the vehicle of the fifth. Sinnett goes the further step in declaring that all principles, even the three finer spiritual princip les \"are material and molecular in their constitution.\" Unknown to him at the time, this was probably his greatest achieveme nt when this book hit the bookstands in Europe. Every spirituali sts came out of the closest and decried him the ult imate \"materialist\". Of course, this declaration is exact ly the same as that of Gurdjieff when 40 years late r he said that"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"\"Everything in the universe can be weighed and meas ured. The absolute is as material, as weighable and measurable, as the moon or as man. If the absolute is God, it means that God can be weighed and measur ed.\" Thus, a great debate ensued which only helped the cause o f revealing more esoteric doctrine to mankind. R. Steiner did a series of lectures in 1915 later p ublished as The Occult Movement in the Nineteenth C entury in which he calls Sinnett \"a journalist whose brain te nded entirely to materialism\" and that Madame H.P.B . \"had been driven into the one-sided sphere of left-wing India n occultists.\" In these lectures, R. Steiner correc tly declares that the teachings of repeated earth-lives, a basic tena nt of Buddhist and Brahman theology of karma and re incarnation, has been deliberately withheld from Christian esote ric teachings. Likewise, the teachings of the septe nary nature of man been intentionally withheld from Christian sour ces. This is because the doctrine of the septenary nature of man pre-supposes a life after death, an ascent through the spiritual worlds to cleanse the palate of anima l desires and sins, a re-birth on earth as a human to forward the evolu tion of the three higher principles of mankind towa rds spiritual perfection and ultimate union with the seventh prin ciple, Atma. Steiner as a Christian esotericist made a deliberat e attempt to unite Eastern teachings about incarnat ion and karma into Christian occult theology. His septenary eleme nts of the man is as follows: l. Physical body 2. Etheric Body 3. Astral Body 4. Ego (thinking, willing and feeling) 5. Spirit - Self (Manas) 6. Life - Spirit (Buddhi) 7. Spirit - Man (Atma) Please note the two changes from the Eastern occult set forth by Sinnett and the Theosophists. First, Steiner re- names the higher triad according to his spiritual s cience doctrine of Anthroposophy. For the years 190 2 from 1913, Steiner was the head of the German Chapter of the T heosophical Society in Europe. During these years h e gave thousands of public lectures using the Theosophical terminology of Manas-Buddhi and Atma for the highe r triad. However, he was fired by Annie Besant, the head of the Theosophical Society which maintained its headq uarters in Adyar, India to preserve its Eastern influence, whi ch Steiner was trying to unite into an East-West oc cult theology. In addition, Steiner flatly rejected the contention of A. Besant and C.W. Leadbeater for the Theosophi cal Society that a young Indian boy named Krishnamurti would be ar the reincarnation of Jesus Christ at the end of the second millennium, an event more than one religious group expected. In the end, Krishnamurti rejected the man tle of Christ consciousness and Steiner's rejection proved valid. However, after leaving the Theosophical Society, h e founded his own Western version called Anthroposophy. It was pr obably in an effort to distinguish his Anthrosophic group from the Theosophic group, that he changed the tradition al Eastern occult terms for the higher triad. Second, he drops the traditional Eastern occult nam e for the fourth principle - Kamarupa or animal sou l and substitutes the term Ego. He further attributes to the ego the functions of kama rupa as thinking - wi lling - feeling. This was a good change so as to eliminate the contr oversy and confusion existing over the fourth princ iple in dealing with higher and lower manas (mind) and calling as S innett did, the fourth principle as vehicle of the fifth (manas). Now, for Western occultism, the fourth principle is simply the human I or ego in its three animal soul functions of thinking (mind), feeling (emotions) and willing (de sire) or the three soul forces in which the ego eme rges, sentient soul, mind soul and consciousness soul. Lastly, Steiner names the second principle the ethe ric body, a term which has taken hold in the Twenti eth Century to distinguish the life body, etheric double from the astral body or body of animal desires. Sinnett ofte n confused the astral body with the etheric double. Personally my classification of the septenary princ iples would name the lower quaternary from Steiner as physical, etheric, astral and ego and keep the Eastern occult terms for the higher triad as Manas, Buddhi and At ma. This blends East and West occult terminology and since s o much more is written about the three higher princ iples in the East than the West, keeping the Eastern terms allow s one when studying the higher principles to have c onsistent terminology. Steiner described the higher triad as follows: \"We have often mentioned that today man consists of four members - physical, etheric and astral bodies , and an \"I\" or ego. This is the key to all spiritual science. W e also know about man's future development, how the \"I\" working from within gradually transforms the astral body so that it finally gains complete mastery over it. Wh en the astral body has been thus transformed, we say that it cont ains Spirit Self or Manas. An astral body ruled by the ego is the Spirit Self or Manas. The same applies to the ether body. When the ego works still more powerfully, it can overcome the opposing forces of the ether body. The transformed ether body then becomes Life Spirit or Buddhi. Finally, when the ego gains mastery over the physic al body, when the most powerfully opposing forces o f the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"physical body are also overcome, man bears in him S pirit Man or Atman. Thus, in transforming his physi cal body into Atman or Spirit Man, he becomes sevenfold. Out wardly, the physical body appears as a physical bod y, but inwardly it is completely controlled and permeated by the ego. At this stage, the physical body is bot h physical body and Atman. The ether body is both ether body and Li fe Spirit or Buddhi, and the astral body is both as tral body and Spirit Self or Manas. The ego has now become ruler of the other members. Thus, man evolves to higher s tages of development out of his own forces. He strives towar d his own deification, as Dionysius the Areopagite, the friend and pupil of St. Paul, called it.\" 3. SEPTENARY IN THE AGES AND EPOCHS OF MANKIND Astronomical Ages Cosmic Christianity demands knowledge of the evolut ionary ages and epochs of mankind which in Christia n tradition is reflected in the APOCALYPSE OF ST. JOH N. First, we must distinguish between ages and epoc hs. An astronomical age is determined by the vernal poi nt of the sun in the plane of the sidereal zodiac. What the ancients called the \"great Platonic year\" is now ca lled the precession of the equinoxes caused by the wobble of the earth's axis due to the gravitational pull of the s un and moon. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" The length of this solar sidereal year was also det ermined by the ancients and even today is determine d to be 25,920 years. While there is an apparent eastward movement of the sun thru the plane of the houses of the zod iac over the course of a tropical solar year, there is also a re verse, precessional motion of the sun thru the side real zodiac over the course of 25,920 years. The vernal point is the loc ation of the sun in the sidereal zodiac on the day of the spring equinox. Our present tropical calender and zodiac p laces this as 1 degree Aries, when in fact, due to the precession, every 72 years it is 1 degree backwards in the zodi ac. As of February 10, 1983, the longitude of the v ernal point was exactly 5 1/2 degrees Pisces in the sidereal zodiac . For this reason, we live in theASTRONOMICAL AGE o f Pisces. Now, an astrological age is different from the abov e astronomical age. The modern calender sets the ve rnal equinox to begin on March 21 concordant with the astrologic al month of Aries. How did we get into this mess wh ere the astronomical vernal equinox on March 21st is actual ly 5 1/2 degrees Pisces, but when you look at your calender or have your horoscope cast, the first day of spring i s 1 degree Aries? Historically, there were two impo rtant changes made to our calender which then was in more confusi on than the tongues of Babel."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Every culture had their own personal system to begi n the new year and all nations, except for the Esse nes, used a lunar calender consisting of 13 months and between 354 and 364 days. Enter Julius Caesar. With the hel p of an initiate named Sosigenes, the first calender reform ed occurred. Taking the year 47 BC, at which time o ur January 1st would have fallen on October 13, he inserted two ne w months of 33 and 34 days between November and Dec ember. Then, he added an intercalary period of 23 days nea r February for a total length of 445 days. Macrobiu s called this long year, the last year of confusion. Beginning th e next year, he started a new year of 365 days with a leap year every fourth year of 366 days. Had he asked, or may be Sosigenes told him, but he could not wait, the A ncient Wisdom would have told him to begin the new year at a new moon on an equinox or solstice. Julius did get one-half of it right. In 45 BC, the new moon occurred 7 days after the December 24th so lstice, so he made December to have 30 days, and began the new ye ar 7 days later on what he called the calends of Ja nuary. Of course, it would have been better to have waited un til a new moon coincided with the winter solstice, but that is how the new year begins on January 1st. Caesar harmoniz ed the seasons with the calender, so that winter wa s again under the signs of Capricorn and Aquarius, except for the precession which no one then would have noticed. Now the Julian year had 12 months, to which he assi gned 30 days to even months and 31 days to odd mont hs, with the exception of February, which had 29 days. Not t o be outdone by his father, for whom the month of J uly was named, Augustus later renamed August and stole one day from February to give himself a 31 day immortal honor. Since the Julian calendar is 11 minutes and 14 seco nds longer than the tropical year of the seasons, b y 1583 the year was about 10 days behind the seasons (one day in 12 8 years). Pope Gregory XIII introduced a reform to delete a leap year every century mark except the fourth. The second change occurred at that famous Council o f Nicea held in 325 AD by Constantine the Great. Th en the good church fathers decreed that the months be fore ver fixed, so that on whatever day the vernal equin ox occurred, it would arbitrarily be called March 21st and the r emainder of the year to adjust accordingly. Since t hen, instead of the equinoctial point moving steadily thru one mont h to another to reflect the precession, the first d ay of spring and Aries is fixed and the months move slowly away back wards."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"With the calender now adjusted for a fixed tropical year, we can look at the remainder of the great cy cle upon which all occult time is reckoned. The actual rate of pre cession is equal to 1 degree every 72 years or acco rding to Newcomb in 1925, 50.2610\" per year. Therefore, at t his precessional rate, the sun travels westward thr u an entire sidereal zodiac house (30 degrees X 72) every 2,160 years. The total precessional cycle of the great solar sid ereal year is fixed at 25,920 years. However, the i nferior cycles of 2,160 years are uneven and unequal in duration and length. For example, the actual length of the stars from one end of the constellation to the other in Pisces is 34 d egrees and its duration will be 2,592 years. For th e constellation of Aquarius, the length is 26 degrees, and the duratio n is 1,872 years. In addition, because of Kepler's laws of planetary motion, the actual rate of motion also varies, so a t the present time, the precessional rate is closer to 71 1/2 years. For these reasons, occultists use an average rate o f 1 degree for 72 years and an average length of 30 degrees per zodical house. Thus, an average astronomical age is set at 2,160 years, even though the individual len gth and rate varies considerably. To determine when the age of Pisces will precess in to the age of Aquarius, simply multiply 5 1/2 degre es by 72 years and add (396) to the last determined year of 1983. Thus, the \"Dawning of the age of Aquarius\" be gins about year 2379, further in the future than many new age morons predict. Likewise, subtracting 2,160 years f rom the end year, we arrive at the beginning of the age of Pisc es at year 219 AD. By extrapolation, we can determi ne the astronomical ages for the five sub-races of the Fif th Aryan root race as follows (taken from Robert Po well): Cancer 8426 to 6266 BC Gemini 6266 to 4106 BC Taurus 4106 tp 1946 BC Aries 1946 BC to 215 AD Pisces 215 AD to 2379 AD Aquarius 2379 to 4535 AD Likewise, we can also extrapolate the astronomical ages for the seven sub-races of the Fourth Atlantea n Root Race as follows: Aquarius 23,546 to 21,386 BC Capricorn 21,386 to 19,226 BC Sagittarius 19,226 to 17,066 BC Scorpio 17,066 to 14,906 BC Libra 14,906 to 12,746 BC Virgo 12,476 to 10,586 BC Leo 10,586 to 8,426 BC CULTURAL EPOCHS The Ancient wisdom referred to these inferior prece ssional cycles as the \"Religious Ages of Mankind\" k nowing the hermetic axiom that \"as above, so below\" reflected a succession of cosmic evolution unfolding in cycle s upon historical evolution. However, although the astrono mical ages ran parallel to the religious ages, they do not run coincident in time with them. This lack of synchron icity has always been a problem to occultists who d ecipher the symbols of a particular age, but can not place the age in historical astronomical time. For me, I always had the problem when, for example, Dr. Steiner places the age of Pisces beginning at year 1413 AD, when I know the astronomical age actually began around year 215. It is so remarkable that even our legacy of tropical astrologists can not determine the dates o f the astronomical ages, by simple calculation. It seems every tropical astrologist has his own date for the age o f Aquarius. One problem stems from the fact that to get the determination of the February 10, 1983 Ephemeris, i t is necessary to have a perfect alignment of the e arth, sun and a fixed star on the ecliptic, which does not often oc cur. Ptolemy in his ALMAGEST, recognized the year 747 BC as the historical date of recorded astronomical an d chronological time (from King Nabonasser of Babylon ). This year coincides with the historical founding date of the city of Rome, whence began the reign of the 7 kings . It is also recognized occultly as the beginning o f the religious age of Aries. However, the astronomical age of Arie s actually begins at year 1946 BC - a difference of 1199 years. The Ancient Wisdom recognized that a change from on e precessional cycle to another reflected a change of consciousness from one level to another. The creati ve hierarchies located in each of the constellation s pour forth spiritual impulses to guide humanity and to commenc e such a new age, give birth to an avatar, manu, me ssiah or Naros. The solution to this problem of the time lag between astronomical ages and CULTURAL EPOCHS (n/f religious ages) was exoterically revealed by Robert Powell in his book HERMETIC ASTROLOGY VOL I (1987) where he says: \"The period of rotation of the Venus Pentagram arou nd the sidereal zodiac is 1199 years. Like the moti on of the vernal point, the rotation of the Venus Pentagram i s backwards, it regresses through the sidereal zodi ac. In the length"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"of time it takes for a complete cycle of the preces sion of the equinoxes through the sidereal zodiac ( 25,920 years), the Venus Pentagram makes some 21 1/2 rotations (21 .5 X 1199 = 25,778.5 years). The ratio of the cycle of the Venus Pentagram (1199) to that of the precession of the equinoxes (25,920) is a little less than the r atio of one to twenty-four, which is the ratio of one hour to one day. If the complete precession cycle is likened to a \"world day\", then the rotation of the Venus pentagram is like th e passage of a \"world Hour.\" When a new astrologica l age starts, signified by the entrance of the vernal point into a new sign of the zodiac, a world hour still elapse s before the new zodiacal impulse begins to register as a cultural p henomenon, and this lapse of time is measured by th e rotation of the Venus Pentagram. A new impulse starts to work o n a spiritual levle as soon as the vernal point ent ers a new zodical sign, but it has to filter through from cos mic realms...The Venus Pentagram acts as a kind of cosmic transformer, stepping down the cosmic impulse, whic h operates on a very high level, a religious level, to become a social impulse, which works on a more human level.\" That being very well expressed, Dr. Steiner has giv en us numerous lectures on the exact dates of the c ultural epochs for the five Post-Atlantean civilizations as follow s: 1. Cancer 7227 BC Hindu/Indian 2. Gemini 5067 BC Persian 3. Taurus 2907 BC Egyptian/Chaldean 4. Aries 747 BC Greek/Roman 5. Pisces 1414 AD European Going backwards in time to the Atlantean age, an is sue arises over whether or not a pralaya occurs bet ween each successive root race. It would seem logical to me t hat each successive root race age would contain 7 a ctive and 5 inactive (rest) inferior cycles of 2,160 years to b alance out a great solar sidereal year of 25,920 ye ars. In this way each Root Race would be complemented by a complete turn of the earth's axis around the polar star. Als o, we will learn from the Law of Twelve that the 7 (manifest) and 5 (hidden) completes a complete cycle between t wo adjoining cosmos. However, Dr. Steiner in his lectures entitled ANCIE NT MYTHS (1918), draws a parallel between the seven th sub- race of Lemuria and the present fifth sub-race (our own) of the Aryan root race. He says that twelve c ultural epochs ago, the sun was also in Pisces. To get back there from here, he drew a continuous line of successive cultural epochs, beginning with four from our age, seven from the At lantean age and one from Lemuria, twelve in all. Th us, from his spiritual investigation of the Akashic record, he f ound no discontinuity or pralaya between the ages. In fact Spiritual Science teaches that a long prala ya occurs after a manvantara, the seven days and fi ve nights of Brahma, and a short pralaya occurs after each succe ssive globe or (Christian) kingdom. thus, globes, a ges and epochs draw no pralaya. During our fourth manvantar a of earth evolution, the 7 globes pass thru 7 Root Race ages thru 7 cultural epochs for a total of 343 Condition s of Form, all without interruption of pralaya. This being diagnosed, we can extrapolate the exact dates for the cultural epochs of the Fourth Atlante an Root Race as follows: 1. Rmoahals 22,347 BC Aquarius 2. Tlavathis 20187 BC Capricorn 3. Toltecs 18027 BC Sagittarius 4. Turanians 15876 BC Scorpio 5. Semites 13707 BC Libra 6. Accadians 11547 BC Virgo 7. Mongolians 9387 BC Leo The Biblical Flood In addition, we can extrapolate the Lemurian third root race as beginning about 37,467 BC and ending a bout 22,347 BC with the fire of tectonic plate subduction that is now raising the Himalayan mountains. Mankind as we can see from these figures is a lot younger than we moderns can conceive. I admittedly even have a problem reconciling occult principles such as the Lemurian sacrifice of Chris t (humanoid standing) and the extrusion of the moon from the Pa cific ocean, both of which occurred during the Lemu rian age with the realistic geologic evidence of planetary e volution. Our traditional methods of radio-active c arbon and other isotope dating of fossils and minerals will continu e to be sacrosanct until scientists understand that all matter enters a state of radiation, not just uranium and several others. In fact, during the pralaya of the seven vi als of wrath, mentioned in the APOCALYPSE, all matter will radiat e so that the physical earth will dissolve and heav enly Jerusalem can descend from the astral world. Looking towards the future, we can extrapolate the dates of the next two cultural epochs as follows: 6.Aquarius 3574 AD to 5734 Russian/Slavic 7. Capricorn 5734 to 7894 American"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Thus, ends the Fifth root race in what Dr. Steiner calls the \"Great war of all against all.\" Now, all of these ages and epochs have their Christ ian occult symbolism ciphered in the revelations of the APOCALYPSE. In fact, the mysteries of cosmic Christ ianity can be summarized in the following sentence: The Cosmic Christ administers His Divine Plan thru His angels. The first mystery is that of Christ as the Solar Logos. The second mystery is that of the Divine Plan as re flected in the evolution of the manvantaras, rounds , globes, ages and epochs. The third mystery is that of the minist ration of this Plan and the Spiritual Guidance of h umanity thru the nine hierarchies of angels, as Christianised by the teachings of Dionysius the Aeropagite, St. Thomas Aquinas and Dr. Steiner. In each of the 7 letters to the 7 churches, St. Joh n speaks to each successive cultural epoch of this Fifth Root Race. Thus, the first five epochs are addressed: Ephesus as Hindu; Smyrna as Persian; Pergamos as Egyptian/C haldean; Thyatira as Greek/Roman and Sardis as the European. Reserved for the future sixth and seventh cultural epochs are Philadelphia and Laodicea. As was the history of Le muria and Atlantis, each great age of the Root Race s ends in catastrophe, respectively, the fires and flooding o f tectonic plate subduction. Our great Aryan age wi ll end in a huge battle of good against evil, such as seen in the \"S tar Wars\" movie trilogy. Following the chronology of the Divine plan, there will be two more Root Races following our Aryan roo t race. The Sixth will commence in year 7894 and adding to this 7 epochs of 2,160 years each (15,120), will end in the year 23,014. This sixth age is symbolized by St. John as the book sealed with 7 seals, each seal being a su b-race cultural epoch of the sixth root race. This evolution will b e a resurrection of the Atlanten root race but at a higher level. The Seventh will commence in year 23,014 and adding to this seven cultural epochs of 2,160 years each (15,120), will end in the year 38,134. This Seventh age is sy mbolized by St. John as the sounding of the 7 trump ets, each trumpet being a sub-race, which also will be a resu rrection of the Lemurian root race. After these great ages, the book of the APOCALYPSE ends with the series of the 7 vials of wrath, the L ast Judgment and the New Jerusalem. In every sense of t hese Christian words, the end of the seventh root r ace, at the sounding of the seventh trumpet, is the end of our planet earth. Having completed a globe of 7 X 7 Con ditions of Form, there will be a short pralaya described by St . John as the pouring of the 7 Vials of Wrath, whic h is described with thunders, lightnings, earthquakes and fallen n ations. This is the radiation of all matter (descri bed above), when the mineral world dissolves. During this transition stage all mankind will be separated into two camps , those of the white robes in whom the Christ impulse resides and those who appear in the form of the beast with seve n heads and ten horns, in whom the serpent still resides. Durin g the Last Judgment, an angel comes down from heave n and chains the great serpent and casts him into the aby ss of the bottomless pit, together, of course, with his legion of human serpents. The descent of the Heavenly Jerusalem represents th e completed goal of physical evolution of this manv antara. The sixth epoch of the seven seals is the descended ast ral world and the seventh epoch of the seven trumpe ts is the descended Heavenly (lower Devachan) world. Of cours e, we should remember that both the astral and Deva chanic worlds consist of what we as humans put into them ( ye reap, what you sow). Everything physical will ra diate and dissolve and pass over into an astral cosmic globe. After a long pralaya, the Fifth manvantara of the future Jupiter planetary evolution begins with our white robed fol lowers of Christ in seed form. The abyss is a symbol for the sub-earthly astral st ate located in nine divisions within the earth's in terior (Dante's Inferno). This is opposite to the above earth astra l state that extends from the earth sphere to the s phere of the sun. The lower astral world consists of evil elementary Ahrimanic spirits and also human souls that have no t evolved past the animal form of the beast. As slaves to their pa ssions, desires and instincts, they have separated out from those humans who have purified their astral bodies and al so bear the Christ impulse within. To the above ear th astral world will ascend the successful souls waiting in t he Heavenly Jerusalem for their incarnation into th e next Jupiter manvantara. To the sub-earth astral world and possi bly the Eight Sphere will descend those failed evil souls where they will wait as elementary spirits, the Final Jud gment at the end of the Vulcan manvantara and the f inal separation of good and evil. It was not our purpose here to discuss all the symb ols of the APOCALYPSE, but to only provide a skelet on form in which to display the chronology of the ages and epo chs of mankind which serves as a foundation for the se meditations. 6. 7,894 to 23,014 Sixth root race 7 epochs of 7 se als 7. 23,014 to 38,134 Seventh root race 7 epochs of 7 trumpets The end of time; Short Pralaya - age of the 7 vials of Wrath; The Last Judgment; The descent of the Heavenly Jerusalem; Long Pralaya; Beginning of the Jupiter manvantara."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"THE SATURN CYCLE There is another confirmation of the lengths of the ages and epochs of mankind as outlined above. Robe rt Powell in his new book THE CHRONICLE OF THE LIVING CHRIST (19 96) discloses his discovery of the \"Saturn Period.\" As is common knowledge, the orbit of the planet Sat urn around the sun is approximately 29 1/2 years. N ow, if one orbit is compared to one day in the ministry of Chr ist, a secret cycle unfolds. According to his calcu lations, taken from the visions of Sister Anne Catherine Emmerich (hereinafter, Sister Christian), the ministry laste d exactly 1,290 days, beginning with the baptism in the Jordan on S eptember 23, 29 AD to the Resurrection on April 5, 33 AD. This 1,290 days is also a secret cycle mentioned in the book of Daniel and translated into 3 1/2 years, is also mentioned several times in the APOCALYPSE. Powell calls the ministry of Christ His \"embryonic period\" because the Baptism by St. John actually ma rked the beginning of the life of Jesus as bearer of the spi ritual being of the Christ as Solar Logos. Prior to the Baptism, the Nathan Jesus was human in every sense of the word, granted, the greatest human who ever lived, but sti ll human. This raises an old debate about the divine nature o f the Jesus person. We know that the ancient teachi ng of the Nestorians preserved a deep secret of Esoteric Chri stianity, that the incarnation of the Christ being as solar logos occurred during the Baptism when the Father said \"T his is my beloved Son, today I have begotten Him.\" Nestorius (b.381 AD) was an Aristotelian Christian who provok ed the great ecumenical debate against the monophys ites. Following Cyril of Alexandria and the Platonic Chri stians, they believed in the unification of the two natures, man and God, of Jesus into an undifferentiated Divine f orm. Part and parcel with this belief, was that Mar y, the mother of Jesus, was also liken to a god, for giving birth to a God. Nestorius, being learned in the great Aristotelian tradition written down in DE ANIMA, knew that the s pirit (nous) descended into the body (soma) and is a nature comp letely separate from the body. The (Holy) spirit wo uld enter (thyrathen) the body from the outside, both for Mar y at the Annunciation and for Jesus at the Baptism .This Duophysite (two natures) doctrine of Nestorius, was declared heretic at the 3rd Ecumenical Council of Ephesus in 431 AD. This act of the church fathers, of course, laid the mind set for the later 8th Ecumenical Coun cil held in 869 Ad in Constantine wherein the trichotomy of body-so ul-spirit was also declared heretic. We will see th e Nestorian doctrine resurrected as the \"Active intelligence-Ho ly Spirit of the moon sphere\" in the 11th century m etaphysics of Avicenna and Averroes, which was later debated by a nother Aristotelian, St. Thomas Aquinas. Following the Nestorian esoterism, we will start th e Embryonic period of the life of Christ at the Bap tism. Whereas the life of a single person unfolds in successive 7 year intervals, so that of the Christ unfolds hist orically over the entire life of humanity. Each day of His ministry i s imprinted into the cosmic heavens of our solar sy stem, which extends to the planetary limits of Saturn. The Gree k name for Saturn was Chronos, the ruler of time. I ndeed, Dr. Steiner says that Saturn is the \" guardian of cosmi c memory\" who records all that occurs in planetary life. If we correspond one day in the ministry of Christ with one orbit of Saturn, we find a secret cycle of (1290 days X 29.4578 years) 38,000 years. Adding to this the 33 years in the entire life of Christ, the result is w ithin one hundred years of our year 38,134 AD which we calculated abo ve as the end of historical time for humanity as ci phered in the APOCALYPSE (the end of the Age of the 7 trumpets). Thus, we have first, the Saturn Period as a confirm ation of historical time as described in the APOCAL YPSE. Second, we can conclude with Powell that the minist ry of Christ \"contains in seed-form the future evol ution of the Christ impulse as it unfolds through historical evo lution.\" This conclusion can be reached about no other relig ious teacher, avatar, manu, buddha or messiah. With Christ being the fulcrum of historical evolution, THE LIFE OF CH RIST EQUALS THE LIFE OF HUMANITY. His life serves as an archetype of the future evolution of humanity . Thus, the great events in His life, such as the B aptism, the Temptation, the healings and miracles, the Transfig uration, the entrance into Jerusalem, the Last Supp er , the Passion ,the night in Gethsemane, the Crucifixion, the Deposition and Resurrection, all these events i n His life will have their corresponding reflection on the physical plane during the entire life of humanity over the next 36,000 years. We are presently still in the age of the Tem ptation in the Desert which lasted for Christ, 40 d ays and will last for humanity (40 X 29.5 years) 1,180 years. Do the time equations for yourselves, follow the de velopment of the macrocosmic ego of the Christ over the corresponding microcosmic evolution of humanity. He re is wisdom. 3.

The Lemniscate of Religion"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" The traditional correspondence between the so-calle d religious ages of man has an astronomical basis i n the Great Solar Year of 25,920 years divided by the twelve zo diac signs into cultural-religious epochs of approx imately 2,160 years as follows: Sign Sub-Race/Cultural Epoch 1. Cancer Hindu-Indian 2. Gemini Persian 3. Taurus Egyptian-Chaldean 4. Aries Roman-Greek"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"5. Pisces Fifth (Present) 6. Aquarius Sixth 7. Capricorn Seventh The leading mission of the Fifth (Aryan) Root Race is the development of manas, the thinking facility, on the physical plane. The origin of logical and analytica l thinking began in the fifth sub-race of the Fourt h Root- Race in the peoples designated by Theosophy as the Primal S emites. The elect of this group were the last to mi grate from the sinking Atlantis. Following the great Manu, they tr aveled from Ireland, eastward through Europe to Cen tral Asia. From here, a colony was directed out to the Indus v alley to start the First Cultural Epoch known as th e Hindu-Indian civilization. Manu directed the seven Rishis to guide the new Fif th root-race and to direct its evolution towards th e development of the mental facility of thought. In addition, Man u directed that all human activities, all human ins titutions, all cultural achievements in science and art bear a rel igious character reflecting man's aspiration to hig her, spiritual worlds. Thus, the fifth root- race carries with it a profound religious fervor different from the miss ion of the fourth root race. Against the direction of the Divine Plan of the Spi rits of Form and the seven Rishis, the sixth sub-ra ce (the Akkadians) and the seventh sub-race (the Mongols) h eld over after the end of the Atlantean period. The oriental Mongols have become the most populated sub-race in the world today. They too partially developed the t hinking facility. However, for various reasons, they held f irm to the ancestral memory of their culture and ne glected the intended development of the thinking faculity. The development of the thinking function of the ego is inversely proportional to the memory function held in the eth eric body. The chief characteristic of the fourth root- race w as an unlimited ancestral memory, which was firmly held over in the Mongol sub-race. Traces of this can also be see n in the Malay sub-race and Polynesians who keep th e sculls of their ancestors hung from the door of their houses. From ancestral memory developed ancestor worship w hich held the same position in the Atlantean races as religio n does now in the Aryan races. The transition from the fourth to the fifth root- race was marked by the decline in a ncestor worship and the rise of Polytheism. In 1893 a certain A.G.Harrison gave a series of lec tures to a group of esoteric Christians naming them selves the Bearean Society. As a group of \"theoretical occulti sts\", their task was to evaluate the growing influe nce of the good Madame H.P. Blavatsky in relation to traditional Ch ristianity with a strong dose of Catholicism. These lectures have recently been reprinted in a 1993 edition entitled, \"THE TRANSCENDENTAL UNIVERSE\". Harrison, as a self-initiated occult Christian reco gnized the septenary in the Religions of Man. In a most unique configuration, he relates the intellectual growth o f the Theology of the fifth Root Race to the succes sive growths of the seven sub-races and/or the cultural/religious e pochs. Harrison is careful to explain that the seven sub-r aces do not exactly correspond to the seven forms o f the evolution of the God Idea in the fifth root race. His configu ration is as follows: Polytheism Esoteric Pantheism Anthropomorphism Theomorphism Christian Pantheism Christian Polytheism Polytheism is the worship of many gods, a pantheon of deities. Harrison says this religion is characte ristic of the Hindu Brahmans. Indeed, the good Madam H.P.B. has o ften remarked that this culture has names for no le ss than 330 million spirits. Pantheism is a view of the entire created universe as a manifestation of God, not God as a deity, but as the sum total of the forces acting in the universe. Schopenhauer was the modern representative of this religion of t he uneducated masses. Harrison says that, \"While Brahminism is a polytheistic religion for the multitude, it is fund ed on a philosophical system which is essentially Pantheist ic\". Thus, for him the esoteric doctrines of the in itiated and adapts of Hindu Brahminism represents the second st age. Anthropomorphism, which includes the monotheism of the Jews, represents an advance for Harrison, becau se Hindu Pantheism was purely an intellectual doctrine, devo id of any personal or moral aspects. For the first time in the fifth root- race, the high spirituality and detached inte llect of esoteric Brahminism was put in a new direc tion by the Jews, that of a god in separately connected with the idea of righteousness. The anthropomorphic act of givin g god a personality, such as the avenging Jehovah, necessar ily gives a moral character to god and his worshipe rs. Likewise, the name given to god by the Jews is a personal one , distinguishing the true god from all false ones. In Christian theology, the god made man and the word made flesh is the ultimate act of anthropomorphism."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Harrison arranged his six stages of the intellectua l understanding of the God-Idea around a neutral ce nter in the shape of a lemniscate . Technically, a leminscate i s in geometry the locus of the foot of the perpendi cular from the center of a conic on its tangent. In two dimensions , a figure eight is representative and in three dim ensions, a double cone or vortex is representative. Realizing that be lief in God can take only three forms, i.e.,polythe ism, pantheism and anthropomorphism, the last three stages for the Harrison lemniscate are a repetition of the first three, only at a higher stage and in the opposite direction. This is a very sound principle in fact for the lemi scate is an ancient esoteric symbol. First describe d by Plato in THE TIMAEUS, with later commentaries by Macrobius and t he Stoics, this symbol becomes the gyres of St. Tho mas Aquinas and the divination tables of Dr. Dee. Swede nborg said, \"all physical reality, the universe as a whole, every solar system, every atom, is a double cone; where t here are two poles one opposite to the other,these two poles have the form of cones\". In the 20th. century, W.B.Yeats wrote (by automatic writing from the spirit of Gir aldus) an entire history of Western civilization using the do uble cone divided into twenty-eight lunar phases as a symbolic template. In the near future, the lemniscate will b ecome a fundamental theorm of science. One only nee d look at the Lorentz attractor (another view ), a figure-eight i n a finite space with an infinite orbital path that never repeats itself nor crosses itself. "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" \"The evolution of the God-Idea starts at this neutr al center, arrives at the same point halfway in its evolutionary course; and touches it again at its finish\". For Ha rrison the neutral center is ignorance, which in mo dern times, corresponds to Agnosticism. At the close of the fourth sub-race, Harrison descr ibes what he calls Theomorphism or the worship of t he Divine Man. The ages of faith of medieval times, the doctr ine of the Holy Trinity and the Latin Catholicism o f the Western Europe characterizes this period. Harrison next proceeds to the fifth sub-race which he sees as roughly the English speaking people whic h have replaced Latin Christianity. In its modern guise, T heomorphism is characterized by the scientific mate rialism of modern Europe and America. Finally he says, \"The re ligions and intellectual evolution of the sub-race are both converging to the point of sacramentalism, and when this point is reached, and the pioneer of scientif ic sacramentalism appears, the fifth period of the evo lution of the God-Idea will draw towards its close, and Christian Pantheism will put an end to the conflict between s cience and religion which has lasted so many centur ies.\" Harrison explains \"sacramentalism is to the spirit what symbolism is to the mind and both are systems which make use of the visible and material things to convey be nefits of an invisible and immaterial character..Go d, as revealed through Christ, conveys his grace, or life giving s piritual impulse, through the medium of the sacrame nts.\" The seven sacraments, Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Matrimony, Penance, Order and Extreme Unction are the evolutionary equivalents of the seven-fold involuti onary spiritual energy which cause birth, strength, nutrition, generation, recuperation, speech and transmutation. Sacrementalism can not be practiced without a profo und respect for ceremonial order, which probably co rresponds to what Alice Bailey describes as the seventh ray n ow coming into manifestation for the Fifth Root Rac e. The seventh ray is one of ceremonial order and control over the forces of nature. Magic, ritual and sacram entalism are characteristic of this ray which she says will mani fest itself predominantly through the Russian natio n. Christian Pantheism of the Fifth (English) sub-race had its beginning in the works of Anna Bonus Kings ford (1846- 1888). She was quite a leading lady of 19th. centur y western Europe. In 1870 she became a Roman Cathol ic, later separated from her minister husband and throughout her life was an editor of numerous women's rights m agazines. Between 1874 and 1880, she lived in Paris with her spiritual mentor, Edward Maitland, as uncle and nie ce, to attend and finally graduate from medical school (where she was refused in England). During this time, her and Maitland experimented together in spiritual researches as me diums. They were contacted by elementary spirits, a ncient Egyptian and Greek spirits, by individual spirits s uch as that of Apollonius of Tyana and Swedenborg a nd even had visions of scenes from the life of Christ. These ve ry occult \"illuminations\" produced a coherent dogma of Esoteric Christianity which they sponsored as a \"new Gospel\" . During May and June of 1881, Maitland and Kingsfo rd presented this material in a series of lectures in London to private audiences. The lectures were publ ished a year later as THE PERFECT WAY or the FINDING OF CHRIST."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"In 1883 Kingsford was elected president of the Lond on Lodge of the Theosophical Society and obviously she must have had a close working relationship with the good Madame H.P.B. Even though she was more connected t o Gnostic Christianity and Egyptian Hermetic sciences , the Mahatma letters state that her appointment wa s approved by the master Koot Hoomi. A fierce battle arose ove r her appointment with A.P. Sinnett who had returne d to London in April 1883 after losing his newspaper edi torship in India. Nowhere was the schism between We stern Christian occultism as represented by Kingsford and Maitland and Eastern Indian occultism as represent ed by Blavatsky and Sinnett more evident than the split i n the London Lodge. To solve the problem, Olcott of fered Kingsford her own separate charter called, \"the Her metic Lodge of the Theosophical Society.\" which she accepted while Sinnett got his candidate elected as new pres ident of the London Lodge of the T.S. Renamed the \" Hermetic Society\", Kingsford and Maitland enjoyed a huge suc cess giving lectures and publishing books on Egypti an Hermeticism. As her Esoteric Christianity (based upon Egyptian H ermeticism) evolved, she became learned in the addi tional occult sciences of Alchemy, the Hebrew scriptures, the Hebrew Kabbalah, Gnostic Christianity, Orphism, Angelology and in 1887, thru the manuscripts Elipha s Levi, the occult astrology of Trithemius and the coming age of Michael. Had she not died an early death, she mi ght have accomplished a synthesis of the entire Wes tern tradition of occultism and her special brand of the new Chris tian revelation. Her Christian esotericism had its unique influence on Annie Besant, C.W.Leadbeater, G.R.S.Me ad, A.E.Waite, C.C.Massey and her financial sponser , the Lady Caithness. The Perfect Way is the most often quoted source boo k in the Secret Doctrine. In fact, it reads like a treatise on Esoteric Buddhism, with the Bible replacing the Sta nzas of Dzyan and Christ representing the perfect B uddha. She accepts the traditional Eastern concepts of incarna tion and karma and places them in a Christian conte xt. As for the Trinity, the Father is deity unmanifest and the Son is deity manifest. God unmanifest and abstract is the primordial mind and the cosmic universe is the ideation of tha t mind. To think is to create. Each planet and orb in infinite space is a thinking, creative god. Likewise, the indivisu al human ego and soul is the \"agglomerate essences\" (or synthesis) of the numberless consciousness composing us. Of greatest interest, her organic Pantheism evolves from synthesis into the discovery of that greatest achievement of R. Buckminster Fuller, the idea of Synergy. First, on the chemical level, she recognizes the principle that water is greater than its parts of hydrogen and oxygen sayin g, \"The sum of activities of the molecules of the r esulting product is different from that previously possessed by its factors..The synthetical resultant is not a mere ag gregate of constituents.\" Then, on the religious level, she co rresponds the synergy principle to the human soul a nd then to the macrocosm, as follows: \"Such as all creatures composing the planet are to the planet, all the planets are to the universe, an d such are the Gods to God (in manifestation). The supreme Ego of the universe is the sum total of all the Gods; His Personality is their agglomerate personalty; to pray to Him is to address all the celestial host, and, by inclusion, the souls of all just men. But as in man, the central unity of consciousn ess constituted of the association of all the consc iousness of his system, is more than the sum total of these, inasmu ch as it is on a higher level;-so in the planet and the universe. The soul of the planet is more than the associated esse nces of the souls composing it. The consciousness o f the system is more than that of the associated consciousness. The consciousness of the manifest universe is more tha n that of the corporate systems; and that of the Unmanifest Deity is greater than that of them all. For the Manifest does not exhaust the Unmanifest; but the Father is greater t han the Son.\" Buckminister Fuller aside, Kingsford is the first t o discover and name (synthetic resultant) the princ iple that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. For her , the organizing synergy is mind and god. For Fulle r it is geometry, but what is the difference if as Plato said, God ge ometrizes. She also accepts in her new Gospel, the traditional Catholic doctrines of the Immaculate Conception, t he Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, the Fall, Origina l sin and the doctrines of the Redemption and Atone ment. Her discussion of angels, elementary spirits and the as tral plane was the best to be seen until the arriva l of R. Steiner, several decades later. She also divides the human p erson into four principles, which include the septe nary principles of the T.S. and the Good Madame as follows: 1. material body (includes sthula-sarira and prana) 2. astral body (linga-sarira, kama-rupa and manas) 3. soul (buddhi) 4. divine spirit (atma) For her, the soul incarnates in many different bodi es to evolve to union with the divine spirit, the C hrist within. At this time, even the T.S. did not teach about reinca rnation, as ISIS UNVEILED side-stepped the issue. O nly with the publication of Sinnetts ESOTERIC BUDDHISM in 1883 a nd in several articles in THE THEOSOPHIST magazine, did the T.S. learn that the Tibetan Mahatmas endors ed reincarnation. It must have caused quite a stir in the T.S."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"when the Catholic Kingsford was actively teaching t he theory that the good Madame, then living in Indi a, rejected in ISIS. If anything bothers me about this great Christian s piritualist, it would have to be the comment of Hen ry Olcott when he met her in 1884 that, \"there was something uncan ny to me in her views about human affection. She sa id she had never felt love for a human being...yet she lavishe d excessive love on (her pet) guinea pig.\" For some one to have actual visions of Christ and not feel human love is certainly a waste. Christian Pantheism at this early stage of developm ent must have borrowed all of its esoteric concepts from the Esoteric Pantheism she intuitively absorbed from Eg yptian Hermeticism and Orphism, and grafted into th em, the Christ impulse. She writes, \"the fundamental truth embodied is the doctrine of Pantheism; God is in al l things, God and God only, in all and through all.\" I suppose th is is only natural if one looks at Christian Panthe ism as a repetition of Esoteric Pantheism, only at a higher stage, the higher stage being the additional mystery of the Ch rist event. The common ground of Pantheism probably is what ear ned her the respect and support of the good Madame and the Master Koot Hoomi. However, at the present time, th e Eastern religions of Esoteric Buddhist and Bramin Pantheism do not recognize Christ as other than one in a succ ession of Avataras. The prejudices against Christ i n the Hindu, Brahman and Buddhist religions is also only natural historically, since these religions pre-date the C hrist event by many thousands of years. However, the prejudices of the leaders of the Theos ophical Society are more difficult to accept. For e xample, the rift caused by A. P. Sinnett to oust Kingsford from the London T.S., her tenure as a Christian president la sting only one year. Although the Theosophical movement represents itself as a generic pantheism with all religions s haring an equal footing, this theological concession is only made if one also accepts the Mahayana Buddhism theo sophy of the good Madame as the mother source of all religions. The good Madame's hatred of the Western Christian c hurches and all practicing Christians was most perv asive. Her successor, Annie Besant, fired R. Steiner as head o f the German Section of the T. S. while on his way to Genoa to give a lecture series on the relationship of Buddha with Christ. It was unbearable to her to have a T. S. member extol Christ and not Buddha as the center-point of earthl y evolution. Another successor of the T. S. in Amer ica, G. de Purucker, calls Christ the \"Syrian Initiate\" and te aches that Christ is an Avatara incarnation of the nirmanakaya of Buddha. The fact is that Christian Pantheism will never bec ome a religious force in the Lemniscate of sub-root races as envisioned by Harrison, unless and until it divorce s itself from the Theosophical movement. Harrison c learly recognized this unhappy marriage between his London contemporaries, Kingsford, Blavatsky, and Sinnett and in his lecture series, taught that Blavatsky was duped by Hindu occultists and that the Masters K.H. and M. n ever existed. In addition, Harrison fervently opposed the Eastern principles of re-incarnation and karma feeling tha t these doctrines were premature and harmful to traditional European Esoteric Christianity. On the last turn of the lemniscate , Harrison descr ibes Christian Polytheism as the nine orders of cel estial creative beings described by Dionysius the Areopagite. We wi ll deal with the angelic orders later, but the impo rtant point is that Harrison recognizes the Divine hierarchies of Dionysius as the final and highest form in the evol ution of the God-Idea for the fifth root- race. B. SEVEN CULTURAL EPOCHS A vastly difference approach to the septenary in th e religions of man is taken by Steiner in his lectu re series entitled, Egyptian Myths and Mysteries, (1908). For him, the religions of man reflect the cosmic events of plane tary evolution. Using Rosicrucian terminology, the evolution of our solar system develops through seven successive pla netary conditions (also called Manvantaras). The first was called Old Saturn which was a condition of a nebul a, the perimeter of which extended to the orbital limit of the planet Saturn. No planetary bodies separated o ut at this stage characterized by uniformity. During the next manvan tara called Old Sun, a central cosmic sun separated out at this stage characterized by duality. During the third ma nvantara called Old Moon, a central sun again separ ated out of the nebula and for the first time a planetary condi tion arose. A planet called the Old Moon orbited th e sun in the same way the present moon circles our present earth , ie. with only one side facing the sun. This creat ed a condition of intense heat and light on one side and intense c old and darkness on the other side. This condition was three-fold. During the pralaya after the Old Moon evolution, th e planets fell back and united with the sun. Only in the fourth round of the fourth manvantara d id the present earth condition arise. During the fi rst three rounds, there was a recapitulation of Old Saturn, Old Sun a nd Old Moon. Then, during the first three root-race s of this fourth round, there was another recapitulation of these pr evious cosmic events. During the first root race, t hat called the Polarian, the sun, earth and moon were united in an arupa-sphere. Here were laid the seeds for the hum an species known as the \"sons of the sun\". During the second o r Hyperborean root race, the earth separated out as an orbiting planet. At this time, the Solar Pitris incarnated i n man creating an upright posture, the beautiful Ap ollo-men. During"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"the third or Lemurian root-race, the moon extruded out of the earth and bi-sexual evolution commenced. During this time, the Lunar Pitris incarnated creating our phys ical ancestors. Thus, what occurred in spiritual cosmic events of p lanetary evolution in three stages is reflected in the physical world as: 1. Unity - Sun 2. Duality - Sun and Earth 3. Trinity - Sun, Earth and Moon As Harrison recognized supra, religion did not come into its own until the Fifth or Aryan root race. T he previous Atlantean epoch was characterized by ancestor worsh ip deriving from an unlimited ancestral memory exta nt in the etheric bodies of the races. For Steiner, the cosmic events of planetary evoluti on are reflected in the epochs and religions of man . This is a very profound correspondence which he describes, We have unity in the primeval past as the attitude of the Indian; while the duality that appeared with the separation of the sun is reflected in the religion of the Pers ians; and in the religions view of the Egyptians, C haldeans and Babylonians we find the trinity that appeared in th e third epoch, after the separation of the earth an d moon. Trinity appears in all the religions of the third period. The Brahman-Hindu religion of the Indians really do es contain all in unity. First, there is the onenes s of the monotheistic para-Brahman. Then there is the trimur ti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The ancient Brahman s were fire worshipers and performed sacrificial rites, th e lower castes were idol worshipers of the lingam a nd yoni. The four Vedas contain the ancient wisdom of the world as given by the seven Rishis. The later Upanishads originate the grand doctrines of incarnation, karma and nirvana. Cult worship appears in the doctrine of the Avatar, or ten incarnations of Vishnu. Sect differentiation arises with initiation rites, mantras and gurus. The Hind u angelic pantheon is almost infinite. Hinduism is the great ocean of all religions. The second cultural epoch is characterized by the d uality of Zoroastrianism. The doctrine of Zarathust ra is preserved in the seventeen hymns of the Gathas and the holy s cripture of the Avesta. For him and the later Zurva nites, there are two fundamentally opposed principals which alwa ys are in conflict, light and darkness, good and ev il, the sun aura of Ahura Mazda and the earth-moon forces of Ah riman. This duality is so pervasive that while ever y other religion recognizes the twelve creative hierarchies of the twelvefold zodiac, the mind of the Zoroastr ian recognizes only six, the Bounteous Immortals or Amahraspands. For them, even the zodiac is not a unity of twelve but six plus six, good and evil, ascending and descending. The third cultural epoch is characterized by the tr inity of earth - sun - moon. In Egypt, we see Osiri s, Isis and Horus. For the Chaldeans, it was composed of Anu, Bel and Hua. Even the Jews, which to this day deny the trin ity and had their beginning (Abraham from Ur) and their captivi ty in Chaldea, when it came time to appoint vowels to pronounce their sacred name JHVH, added the vowels from the Chaldean trinity. J e h ov a h is Bel, Hoa , and Anu.(see the table of correspondances for the Trini ty on page ). For the early Christian Gnostics and Ophites, the s upreme God was IAO, from whom derived the seven pla netary aeons or genii. Pronounced ee - ah - oh, in the fir st instance, the letters e - a -o came from the sam e Chaldean trinity and in the second instance, correspond to I = Isis - Virgo, Nature, Mother O = Osiris - Sol, slain and risen A = Apophis - Scorpio (Typhon, Set), death & destro yer As the good Madam H.P.B. exposed in ISIS UNVEILED, the doctrine of the trinity is eminently pre-Christ ian and representative of all cultures of the third sub-rac e or cultural epoch. In the fourth sub-race we see a new impulse derived through the Jewish peoples, that of monotheism. Th is religion represents a turning away from the direction of the first three sub-races, which were characterized by a differentiation from the original Hindu unity. Thus , there are now two religions currents manifesting in evolution. The first is that of plurality or emanation from un ity. This current proceeds from a number which in t he first instance is the one, the para-Brahman. Then, the three repre sented in the trinity; the seven, represented in th e planetary aeons, genii, Elohim and St. John's seven Spirits before t he Throne. Finally, there is the twelve, representi ng the creative hierarchy forces of the twelvefold zodiac fixed sta r system. The second current is that of monism, a synthetic, all pervading movement towards the monad, represent ed by Jewish monotheism and the Books of the Quabbalah. T he polarity created by these two currents are neces sary for the proper development and evolution of the religio ns of man. An associative force towards unity and a dis- associative force away from unity, into plurality. Both forces corresponding to the fundamental polar forces of the physical plane, centrifugal and centripetal."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Beginning the fifth sub-race, Steiner recognized th e lemniscate or double vortex of religion and the p rincipal of repitition working again on a higher level. For him , the fifth, sixth and seventh sub-races repeat the mselves at a higher level as a repetition of the third, second a nd first sub-races. Thus, 1. Cancer Hindu/Indian Unity 2. Gemini Persian Duality 3. Taurus Egyptian/Chaldean Trinity 4. Aries Greek/roman Monotheism 5. Pisces fifth Trinity 6. Aquarius sixth Duality 7. Capricorn seventh Unity In our fifth cultural epoch, there has been no decl ine in the belief of the Trinity. However, the chie f characteristic of this period, as also observed by Harrison, is scien tific materialism. Steiner says that this attitude comes from the spiritual fact of the Egyptian practice of mummifyi ng the dead. By preserving the outer form of the bo dy, the soul after death was more bound to the physical plane. T he soul is susceptible to impressions after death a nd the picture of the mummified body made a lasting impression on Egyptian souls after death. Theses same souls have now incarnated in this fifth epoch and this remembrance lives on as a strong impulse to materialism. In Foundations of Esotericism, Steiner says that th e entire fifth root- race is descended from the pri mal Semites, who were the fifth sub-race of the Atlantean (fourth) r oot- race. Likewise, a new spiral is forming in the fifth sub-race of this fifth root -race, that of the hidden spiritual ity of the Russian peasantry. As the culture of the present fifth cultural epoch is descending, the culture of the Russian six th cultural epoch is ascending. The first three cul tural epochs had a common esoteric mystery center source. The fourth epoch of Semite monotheism is neutral, as observed by Harrison, and repeats none of the former or later e pochs. Beginning the fifth epoch, a new impulse eme rges in the Russian people, looking towards the future, while r epeating the former first three epochs on a higher level. The central and western European cultures are the advan ce post of what is to develop out of the Slavonic p eoples of the European east. For Steiner, the future sub-races or cultural epochs are: 5. Pisces - Central European, led by German 6. Aquarius - Eastern European, lead by Slavonic 7. Capricorn - American The task of the German peoples of this fifth cultur al epoch is to take in the Christ impulse more and more consciously in the future. This Christ impulse has worked sub-consciously in the astral and etheric bo dies over the past centuries. Now and in the future, the \"marriag e in heaven\" of Martinus Cappella and Christian Ros enkreutz will take place ever more often, this being the consciou s union of the ego and astral body with the Christ impulse. This task of the German peoples is being accomplish ed by their guiding folk spirit in a unique way. Hi storically, souls in incarnation pass from one culture to anoth er. It is unusual for a person having lived, for ex ample, as a Greek, to be incarnated later in the same Greek cul ture. However, in present Germany are souls who hav e lived as members of the Germanic tribes in the past. This gi ves a particular strength to the Germanic folk spir it and a conscious link with the Christian religion. When in their next incarnation, these former German souls appear in the Slavonic culture, there will be a rapid cultural ev olution characterized by this united Christ impulse . That which will happen in the sixth cultural epoch will be prepared beforehand for the Germanic peoples. The civilization of the Slavonic peoples in the fut ure sixth cultural epoch will be primarily a recept ive one working on two levels. First, there will be the receptivity of the achievements of Western Europe, such as the technology, music, arts and sciences. The field of experimentat ion of modern technology lies in the West and the f ruits of its success shall easily pass to the sixth culture. Second, there will be the receptivity of the descen t of the spiritual forces of the sixth principle, B uddhi. The full manifestation of Buddhi on the physical plane will occur in the next Round during the future sixth roo t- race, while the sixth sub-race in this fourth Round will receiv e only a taste of what the future holds. This taste , where the ego looks upwards to the higher principal, will manifes t itself as a duality in mankind corresponding to t he duality felt by mankind in the second, Persian, cultural epoch. As stated supra, the bodies of man consists of the lower quaternary of physical, etheric, astral and e go. Above this quaternary, stand the trinity of macrocosmic princi ples, Manas, Buddhi and Atma. The first three princ iples of the lower quaternary have fully descended upon mankind and have been incorporated into his being, the four th is presently in manifestation. The trinity of the high er principles have only partially descended upon ma nkind and only in a few adapts have they been incorporated into th eir being. For the mankind of the fifth cultural epoch, there is not yet any duality between the lower quaternary and the higher trinity because the ego is still firmly grounded in the lower quaternary. However, as the ego matures into the sixth cultural epoch, for many persons the ego will groun d itself in the higher trinity. In this respect, th e Hindu"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"classification of the septenary in man is more desc riptive than our Western model, because it recogniz es a higher and lower manas. Using this Hindu terminology, the ego of the man of our fifth epoch has its center of gravity in lower manas, while the ego of man of the sixth epoch will have its cen ter of gravity in the higher manas. This will creat e a duality in which man will consciously feel the higher manas st ruggling to hold the lower manas in complete contro l. Two WILL CENTERS develop in man, each the expression of the ego manifesting itself in the higher and lower natures. In the terminology of C.G. Harrison, each will cent er can be considered double vortices acting against each other at unequal velocity or force, producing our old friend , the lemniscate. These conical spheroids, which pr ojected in two dimensions as double spirals or vortices, revolve i n opposite directions until equilibrium is reached by an axial coincidence of the rotational planes. This equilibr ium is the \"marriage in heaven\" of the higher and l ower manas. Steiner says that this duality felt in each individ ual man will express itself in theology as an exper ience of the duality inherent in Christ. His divine nature is represente d microcosmically in the higher trinity and his hum an nature so represented in the lower quaternary. Understanding the Christ being as an organic unity of divine and human natures will help man to understand and balance his higher and lower manas. Christianity in the future will co me to shape the social order of our towns, states and nation. ASIAN WAR It should be considered also that the Asian contine nt bears three totally different sub-races. The Chi nese culture derives from the last of the seven sub-races of the fourth Atlantean Root-Race. This is a wholly self- contained culture not capable of further development, since t hey did not take up the ego impulse of the primal S emite sub-race. The Hindu-Indian culture derives from the first sub -race of the Fifth Aryan root-race and represents a polar opposite to the Chinese culture preserving the Atlantean cha racter. Since all sub-races of the fifth root-race receive the ego impulse to a certain extent, the Hindu-Indian cultu re is capable of further development. However, this development is limited since their folk-spirit evolved its high spirituality prior to the Christ event. It would seem very likely that these two opposite c ultures, the last of the Atlantean race and the fir st of the Aryan race, would someday come into conflict, even war. A nd if this conflict did arise, it would occur in th e backyard of Russia, the evolving future sixth sub-race. THE ALPHA-OMEGA CONFLICT The seventh sub-race or cultural epoch will see a r eturn to unity, characteristic of the Hindu-Indian sub-race but, again, repeated at a higher level. In a certain sen se, mankind was destined to so return because when the spirit of the age of the first sub-race of India has completed hi s task, he was raised to the guiding spirit of the entire evolution of the fifth root-race. Even though this spirit is evolving over the many t housands of years of this root- race, he necessaril y must retain some of his original Hindu character. This Hindu ch aracter experienced the ego or I subjectively long before it was able to experience an objective ego or I available after the Christ event. The Hindu culture is the Al pha or first sub- race and was very mature in its soul development an d spirituality at the time of the Christ event, whi ch occurred many thousands of years after the Rishis appeared t o instruct the old Indians. The Christ event could not be grasped and understood by a culture who did not recognize t he workings of the angels and archangels that coope ratively who brought about the Christ event. At the opposite extreme, we observe in the cultures of the fifth and sixth sub-races, the relatively y oung peoples of Western and Eastern Europe, who lived through worki ngs of the angels and archangels who brought about the Christ event. For example, the folk-spirits (archangels) o f the English (1650), Italian (1530) and French (16 00) peoples did not achieve an ego-will-identity, which in the phys ical plane reflects itself as a distinct nationalit y, until the 16th and 17th Centuries. Prior to this time, these cultures were barbaric compared to the mature Hindu, then la ter Persian and still later Egyptian sub-races. For the peoples of Western Europe, the ego was more of an objective re ality that developed relations between things, such as other p eople, other groups and other nations. As the ego m atures into the last Omega seventh sub-race, it will harden, be come selfish ad evil. The task of this presiding spirit of the fifth root -race is to unite the Alpha races of the subjective ego with the Omega races of the objective ego. The religions of the Al pha cultures look backwards to a union with the spi ritual worlds with a personal subjective ego. Thus, Hinduism, Bra hmanism and Buddhism are characterized by suppressi on of the ego, a denial of the senses, a recognition of maya, an escape from desire and rebirth, and a personal striving to nirvana. The religions of the Omega cultures look forward to a union with the spiritual worlds with an imperson al, objective ego. The Omega religions carry within themselves th e Christ impulse which is a religion for all humani ty. The Christ impulse is impersonal and rejects the castes of the Brahmans, Magi and Egyptian priests. It is universal humanity accepting beggars, thiefs and indian chief s. It is objective because it recognizes the Christ as a spirit united"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"with earth evolution and which descended from a cel estial sphere higher than Brahman, Ahura Mazda and Osiris. It does not suppress the ego with an aversion for eart hly incarnation but raises the ego to work cooperat ively within the various groups and nations of humanity towards a co mmon salvation. Thus, there is necessarily some conflict between th e Alpha and Omega sub-races which can be characteri zed as the personal, detached self path towards salvation and the impersonal, group path of the Christ impulse. L ikewise, there is necessarily some conflict between the presiding (formerly Hindu) spirit of the entire fifth root-ra ce and the various spirits of the age for the fifth, sixth and seventh sub-races who evolved during and after the Christ event. Likewise, there must necessarily be some conflict b etween the Christ who is a spirit united with all h umanity for all future root races and the presiding spirit of this fifth root-race. When during the fourth sub-race (G reek-Roman) the spirit of the fifth root-race appointed the spirit of motion on Mars to lead his epoch as a spirit of the age, the West rejected this appointment and exchanged in his plac e the Christ spirit, a split occurred between the E ast and West, the Alpha and Omega. The task of the seventh sub-ro ot race is to unite these religious conflicts. DESCENT OF MANAS On another level, we shall see during the seventh s ub-race this \"marriage in heaven\" the unity of the ego and manas. The task of the Atlantean fourth root-race was to p repare the human physical body to become the bearer of the microcosmic ego. For this to happen, a physical eve nt in evolution had to first occur. Prior to the At lantean flood, no person was able to develop ego self-consciousness t o the extent to say \"I am\". His ego was more closel y connected to a common group soul and ancestral memory. By the time of the flood, the physical body had developed to such an extent that the physical event could occur, i.e., t he etheric head sank into and merged with the physi cal head. This physical event made it possible for the human body to carry the descending ego fulfilled by the Christ Spirit. The task of the Aryan fifth root-race was to prepar e the ego for the descent of the microcosmic fifth principle of manas. This preparation took place slowly, spread o ver the seven sub-races as follows: 1. Hindu/Indian etheric body 2. Persian astral body 3. Egyptian/Chaldean feeling -soul 4. Greek/roman thinking-soul 5. European willing-soul 6. Slavonic Manas 7. Seventh Buddhi In the first post-Atlantean sub-race, the Hindu-Ind ian culture developed the etheric body as bearer of the ego, as was accomplished with the physical body prior to the At lantean flood. The ancient Indian could perceive by the forces of the etheric body and this gave rise to the great wi sdom of the Vedas and the developed soul forces of the yogas. In the second sub-race, the Persian culture develop ed the astral body as bearer of the ego. The astral body being much more active than the etheric body, the Persian s performed physical work in developing a material culture, much the opposite of the Indian culture. Beginning the third sub-race, the ego itself develo ps through its soul functions of feeling, thinking and willing. The Egyptian - Chaldean sub-race developed the feeling or sentient function of soul as bearer of the ego. These cultures were directed outward towards the stars and their t ransits. Astronomy arose as a science. In the fourth sub-race, the Greek-Roman culture dev eloped the intellectual or thinking soul as bearer of the ego. The intellectual achievements of the Greek culture have never really been equaled by a later culture. For this reason Alfred North Whitehead says that the history of Wes tern civilization consists of a series of footnotes to Plato. Aristotle invented logic. The Romans invented juris prudence, legislative government and the concept of the free citizen with legal rights. However, for reasons sta ted in the section on \"the culture of 666\", the kno wledge of Hellenistic culture was suppressed in Europe beginn ing about 400 A.D. because it was not inspired with the Christ impulse. In the present fifth sub-race, the European culture develops the willing or consciousness soul as bear er of the ego. The political reflection of this event is the exten sion of the Roman concept of a free citizen with le gal rights to the concept of a personal, individual freedom for each citizen. The rule of primogenitor, where a person i nherited his rank in the community, together with the laws of fi efdom, serfdom and fee-tail, all worked against the striving of the individual, conscious ego to achieve statue in soci ety. Beginning first in England with the Magna Cart a and its Parliamentary forms of government and later in Ital y with its free city states, the individual ego act ively worked in society releasing the bonds chains of inherited sta tus. The pinnacle of the transition from Medieval g overnment to Constitional contract government was the American D eclaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. All of the demands of the modern age come from the conflict be tween the consciousness soul seeking political free dom from the old institutions. In present American jurisprud ence, nearly every week, the legal system extends t he boundaries of individual human rights in housing, education an d social services, particularily in the area of hom osexual rights."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Now, within the European culture each nation has it s specific mission and this mission is guided by th e respective folk-souls as archangels. Folk-souls work into mans etheric body and guide from therein. Physical even ts being a reflection of spiritual events, the political life of humanity as reflected thru nations is really the spiritual life of folk- sprits. In addition, folk-spirits evolve their prin ciples over time in the same way that individual me n and cultures develop and evolve their principles. For this reaso n every nation represents a certain stage of develo pment of their evolving folk-spirit ego. For example, Steiner says that in Italy and Spain, the national element come s to expression in the feeling or sentient soul. In France, it come s to expression as thinking or intellectual soul. I n England, it comes to expression as willing or spiritual soul. In Germ any, it comes to expression in the full ego. Eventually, the conflict between the warring folk-s ouls will converge into a common, unified folk-soul of Europe. Efforts to achieve this is now seen in the effort t o create a European Common Market. With the new uni fication of East-West Germany, the German folk-spirit will grad ually transform Himself into a Spirit of the age, l eading a unified Europe into the sixth sub-race. In the future sixth sub-race, manas will descend pr oducing (duality) two will centers of higher and lo wer manas, as above described, which when evolving into equilibri um, will create the \"marriage in heaven\" of the hum an ego and manas. This epoch will be characterized by an agree ment between what different people experience as a higher reality in the same sense that people today experie nce as an agreement of higher mathematical and geom etric axioms. As fortold in THE APOCALYPSE OF ST. JOHN, t his culture of Philadelphia will bring peace and brotherhood thru a common wisdom that \"hath the key of David\". Steiner refers to the descent of Manas in the sixth epoch as the three days of initiation. In the GOSP EL OF ST. JOHN(1908) he comments on the prophecy from this go spel, \"on the third day there was a marriage in Can a of Galilee\". The first day of initiation was the trans ition from the third to the fourth cultural epoch. The second day of initiation was the transition from the fourth to th e fifth epoch. The third day of initiation will be the transition from the fifth to the sixth epoch. These three days of i nitiation correspond to the three days of entombmen t in the ancient Mystery Schools the candidate spent under the spiri tual guidance of the hierophant. The marriage in Ca na corresponds to the marriage in heaven of higher and lower manas with the mature Christ impulse. These three days of initiation also correspond to t hree historical ages. The first representative of t he Father as the age of the Old Testament. The second representative of the Son as the age of the New Testament. The th ird, beginning the 20th century, as representative of th e Holy Spirit. In the future seventh sub-race, Buddhi will descend upon a community of free and independent egos. Thi s is referred to in THE APOCALYPSE as the Church of Laodicea whic h forms a stream in humanity of warring, fighting e gos, unable to unite and harmonize conflicting social an d personal interests and desires. The other stream in humanity is represented by the brotherhood of the Church of Phi ladelphia, whose foundation will be laid down in th e sixth epoch. At the close of the seventh epoch these two streams will do battle in what is called the \"great war of all against all\". At the close of the fourth Atlantean age, civilizat ion was destroyed by the great flood. So will the c ivilization of the fifth Aryan age perish by the great war. As occurre d at the end of the Atlantean age, the great Manu w ill lead a small group of highly evolved persons out of the ashes to populate a new civilization of the sixth root race . WHAT IS ISLAM ? (The other Son of Abraham) Islam is the fastest growing religion on the planet . In our century, the great french intellectuals, F rithjof Schuon, Rene Guenon, Titus Bruckhardt and Henry Corbin, hav e fallen away from Christianity and embraced with o pen hearts the Islamic revelation. Bruckhardt says, \"Islam regards itself as the renew al of the primordial religion of Humanity.\" Schuon says, \"Islam integrates Christ in its perspective...Accor ding to this perspective, the Word does not manifes t itself in any particular man as such, but in the Prophetic functi on-in the highest sense of the term-and above all, in the revealed books: and since the Prophetic function of Mohammed is real and the Koran a true revelatiom, Moslems, who admit only these two criteria, see no reason for placing Jesus before Mohammed. Indeed, they must give prece dence to Mohammed, in as much as the latter, being the last representative of the Prophetic function, recapitul ates and synthesizes every aspect of this function and CLOSE S THE CYCLE ON THE MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD.\" Schuon further says that the three monotheistic rel igions, Judism, Christianity and Islam, are all rel igions of the Prophet and the revealed book(s). Excepting the Mor mons, it is true that Mohammed is the last prophet of the cycle. Schuon raises the following grave issues for Christ ians. Why should Christianity be considered the \"true rel igion\" , when it is, admittedly, not the final one of the cycle."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Why should Christ as a prophet and His books (the o ld and new Testaments) of the Divine Word be given precedence over other revelations, when both Christ and His Revelation can wholly be integrated into t he Islamic paradigm, which extends from Adam, thru Abraham, to Mohammed? Why should Christianity continue the priestly funct ions of the sacraments, when the historical necessi ty of the division between royal and sacradotal functions has virtually been eliminated by the rise of Democracy and women in the (protestant, anyway) priesthood? Islam has e liminated the need for a priesthood, since every Mo slem is everywhere a priest within his own religion. \"It ma tters little to him whether or not he is externally severed from the Moslem community; he always remains his own priest and an autonomous unity.\" Every Moslem can perform the essential rites of his religion, personally, by him self. It is clear to me the reason the great French intel lectuals have left the Christian community is that Islam is a \"spiritual, religious and social block\" that has so lved the historical problems of the Prophet, the Wo rd and the priesthood. Like no other religion, Islam is a comp lete unity and perfect monotheism. So say what you Christians about that? Well, I might only retort that the Bodh isattva of this century converted to a Roman cathol ic! To evaluate this dilemma, I would say first, that S chuon is wrong to call Christianity one of the thre e monotheistic religions. There is NO what he terms, \"Ternary Aspe ct of Monotheism.\" With its Trinity, Christianity i s not strictly monotheistic, as it resembles all religions of the third cultural epoch that reflect the recapitulatio n of the sun-moon- earth evolution in the form of a trinity. The reason why Islam is so popular and powerful is that it replaced Judaism as the only monotheistic r eligion on the planet. As Dr. Steiner says in THE MISSION OF FOLK SOULS (1910), \" There are two spiritual currents in mankind. The one must be called, that which proceeds from plural ity, Monadolgy, which conceives the origin and source of existence as consisting primarily of a number of b eings and forces. (Thus we have the Hindu) Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu (and the German) Odin, Hoenir and Loedur. Th is is the current which, because it proceeds from a number, m ay assume the greatest possible variety. \"This worship of many HAD to be opposed by a synthe tic, all comprising movement which proceeded strict ly from the Monon, Monism. The actual inspirers, the impuls e givers of all monotheism and monism, of the worsh ip of a single divinity, are the Semitic peoples... It is i n their nature, it is in their blood, to represent the one God, the Monon. The other peoples have pluralistic impulses. \" Looking at this dichotomy of monism vs monadism, Ch ristianity certainly is pluralistic in its Trinity, contra Schuon. Steiner even confirms this when he says, \"the monon in India was soon divided into a trinity, as the o ne God of Christianity is divided into three persons.\" The ke y to understanding these two spiritual currents of humanity is that the schism creats a \"great polarity' between plural ism and monism and we know that evolution on the ph ysical plane always proceeds thru a duality of yin-yang. Here Dr . Steiner states the key- \"Monism is not possible without pluralism and the l atter is not possible without the former. Therefore , we must recognize the NECESSITY FOR BOTH.\" This is the rule for spiritual evolution on the phy sical plane. Now, what happened to the monistic impulse of the J ews? As Steiner has said many, many times and Schuo n re- emphasizes as follows: \"The monotheistic religion belonged originally to t he entire nomadic branch of the Semitic group, a br anch that, having issued from Abraham, was subdivided into two secondary branches, one issuing from Isaac and the other from Ishmael, and it was not until the time of Mose s that monotheism took a Judiac form: it was Moses who, at a time when the religion of Abraham was growing di m among the Ishmaelites, was called upon to give monotheism a powerful support by linking it in a certain manner with the people of Israel, who thus became its guardians. It may thus be said that Judaism annexed monotheism and made it th e possession of Israel.\" Obviously, the line of Isaac has terminated with wh at Schuon calls \"Christ put a final term to the rel igion of Moses.\" This is very true but for the wrong reasons. In that most profound treatise of revelation, THE M ISSION OF FOLK SOULS, Dr. Steiner explains why cert ain civilizations rise to a pinnacle but suddenly, almo st overnight, crumble away into cultural diaspora. For the Celts, their guiding archangel renounced going to the high er level of a Spirit of the Age. Instead, he sacrif iced himself and became the \"inspiring spirit of Esoteric Christiani ty.\" Likewise, the Greek archangel renounced his as cension to this higher level to become the \"guiding spirit of Exote ric Christianity.\" As a result, both Celtic and Gre ek nations \"crumbled away so quickly.\" Here is another occult law of spiritual evolution. Every nation is guided by its archangel, who lives and evolves himself within this cultural-linguistic group chara cteristic of a natioon. When the folk-spirit leaves his folks, by reason of either, (1) renounciation or (2) the norm al evolution of the rise and fall of civilizations, the folk, without a center, crumbles away into diaspora."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Celtic and Greek diaspora are two examples of r enunciation. The other process is one of normal evo lution, when the guiding archangel, lives in unity within h is folk culture, thru the rise and fall of its civi lization. Then, the archangel matures and leaves his folk of his own vo lition, in order to continue his evolution in the h igher spheres of the angelic hierarchy. Scattered around the planet are pockets of \"remnants of former cultures\" such a s the Polynesians in the Pacific ocean, the Indians in th e Caribbean and the American Indians. These groups are the remnant diaspora of the former Atlantean races and sub-races whose guiding archangel matured and volun tarily left many thousands of years ago. Contrast this situatio n with the genocide of the native Indian of 19th ce ntury Argentina, which results with, of course, no remnan ts left over. The archangel of these remnants did not desert thei r folks in any negative sense. To the contrary, the ir archangel, having completed his evolutionary task assigned to him, departed and rose to the level of a Spirit of the Age, as a normal process of evolution thru the angelic hierar chies. We know the Divine Plan of the Spirits of Fo rm was to have each of the seven Atlantean races evolve conse cutively, one after another. However, because of th e interference of the Planetary Spirits of Motion, ev olution of the successive races was held back, held over. Thus, the Divine Plan of the Spirits of From was to have, for example, the Toltecs, to evolve in their normal course, the rise and fall, the ascending and descending pha ses. But, when the descending phase was historicall y and chronologically completed, this race was not termin ated (yes, in the genocidal sense of the word), but certain peoples remained over. So in the Americas, for exam ple, we have small groups of \"held over\" sub-races, such as the Mexican and American Indians, who struggle to survi ve, without the spiritual guidance of their archang el. At least, the American Indian acknowledged that their Great S pirit was dead. As V.S. Naipaul has correctly obser ved, the Carribean peoples of Central America will never hav e a cohesive social and political culture. They can not ever, being a surviving remnant of a former great civiliz ation, that should have been extinct when the delug e waters of the Biblical flood submerged the Atlantean continent. I know that this analysis sounds harsh and I do not want to be accused of fostering genocide, but the Divine Plan of the Spirits of Form is an example of what the ancie nt Egyptians called the \"Iron will of necessity.\" For the Jews of the third cultural epoch of the Ary an fifth root race, the situation is even more dram atic and complicated. First, at the angelic level, there was an inspiring folk-soul, Elijah, who was not merely the normal angel, aspiring to rise to the level of arch-angel. He had the (miraculous) powers of an archangel who had descended to the level of an angel. Dr. Steiner speaks of the origin of this folk-soul: \"For such an individuali ty, provision is made in the Mother-Lodge of Humanity. Such an ego w as born into the body under the immediate guidance and direction of the great Mother-Lodge of Humanity in the central sanctuary of earthly spiritual life. Th e John (Elijah) ego descended from the same holy region as that fro m which the soul-being of the (Nathan) Jesus child descended.\" In each of his incarnations as Phinehas (son of Ele azar), Elijah-Naboth, Elijah-Elisha and St. John th e Baptist, he rescued the fallen group spirit of the people and r estored its vigor to fulfill their karmic mission. At the arch-angelic level, Michael was the guiding folk-spirit, who received orders from the higher Ar chai and give orders to his folk-soul. He was also more elevated than the normal archangel, being a sun spirit and a cting as the countenance of Jehovah. The corresponding Spirit of the Age was the Greek Archai, which had basically fulfilled his task by the end of the Golden Age of Greece. In normal cultural evolution, when we approach the second angelic hierarchy, there is no direct corres pondence between the nation and the guidance from the Spirit s of Form and Spirits of Motion. These higher spiri ts normally work equally thru all nations of a race or sub-race . However, with the Hebrew nation, Jehovah-Elohim, as a Spirit of Form worked directly in the Jewish blood from Abrah am, thru the 3 X 14 generations of the Matthew Gosp el, to the birth of Jesus. At the level of the Planetary Spirits of Motion, th e Semitic race belonged to the Mars race-spirit. Ag ain, there is not a normal relationship here. The Mars Spirits themse lves work directly thru the blood producing the Mon golian race. However, in order for Jehovah to intervene and work directly thru the blood, a special cooperation had to be reached between the two spirits, so that Jehovah ALONE and not the Mars Spirits, could have exclusive influenc e over the Hebrew nation. Thus, throughout the second and first angelic hiera rchies, all angelic beings worked cooperatively for the great karmic task of the evolution of the Semitic race; w hich in the Abraham-Isaac line would bear the incar nation of the Christ and in the Abraham-Ishmael line which into t he future would continue the monotheistic tradition of the Prophet and the Word. The special angelic beings wh o guided this mission were: Elijah angel Folk-soul Michael arch-angel Folk-spirit Greek Archai Spirit of the Age Jehovah-Elohim Spirit of Form"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Mars/Jehovah Spirit of Motion Now, as Schuon says, the Christ event ended the pro phetic cycle of the Abraham-Issac Semitic line, but as I have said, for the wrong reason. The real reason was tha t the \"Mission Impossible\" accomplished, the specia l alliance of guiding spirits served its Divine purpose and was t herefore disbanded. Elijah has had at least two sub sequent incarnations, as Raphael and Novalis, but these are not connected with the Hebrew race. Michael has wi thdrawn his leadership in preparation for his Regency as Spirit of the Age beginning 1879. The Greek Archai renoun ced and lives on as the inspirer of Exoteric Christianity t hroughout the future Spirits of the Ages. Jehovah h ad ascended the angelic ranks and the Mars Planetary spirit had res umed his former activity as a race spirit. With the se angels leaving in the normal course of evolution, Jewish d iaspora resulted, with the destruction of the Essen e monastery in Qumran and the razing of the Temple and city of Jer usalem in 70 AD. Mission Impossible accomplished, was the departure of the leading Jehovah spirit the end of the monist ic impulse ? No, the Spirits of Form, in their infinite wisdom, had a back up plan preserved in the Semitic line of the other son of Abraham, Ishmael. For a new monistic impulse to be implanted, the remaining Semitic peoples were the b est suited for two reasons. First, the blood line had been wor ked over for the 3 X 14 generations by Jehovah. Sec ond, the monistic tradition of the prophet and the book of t he Word had also existed since the time of Moses. I slam as the direct descendant of the duplicate Semitic line fro m Abraham was the best suited to integrate these tw o traditions. They need only to eliminate the priesthood which wa s destined to extinction anyway as a penalty for th e crucifixion of Christ. In conclusion, Islam is the logical conclusion to t he other Adam-Abraham-Ishmael line established by M elchisadek as the bearer of the monistic impulse. As a religio n of fervent monotheism, Islam will necessarily con flict with its closest pluralistic religion, Christianity. It will most likely be the source of the anti-Christ. Howe ver, Christianity and Islam should stand side by side, like neighbors with a good fence, and recognize a respect for eac h other. The spiritual development of humanity needs and require s this eternal duality. RELIGION (conclusion) I While it is true that the leading mission of the Fi fth root race is the development of Manas on the ph ysical plane, it is equally true that the development of this thinking faculty proceeds hand in hand with the cultural evo lution of religious forms on the same plane. The Atlantean Ag e was first and foremost an evolution of the divers ity of human races thru their etheric bodytypes. In our Fifth Ar yan root race, diversity of races falls into the ba ckground, while religious evolution proceeds in the foreground thru its septenary forms. Dr. Steiner was absolutely co rrect in disagreeing with the Good Madame H.P.Blavsatsky and her Theosophists, that religion, not racial divers ity, continues thru the Fifth Age. Hand in hand with religious evolution comes cultura l evolution. This is why Dr. Steiner renamed the se ven Theosophical epochs of the Fifth Age as cultural ep ochs and not as racial epochs. Each cultural age is commenced with a theophany, a religious revelation of the pro phet and his book, the logos. Thus, for the Hindu r evelation, we have the group revelation of the prophet thru the S even Rishes and the books of the Vedas. For the nex t epoch, we have the revelation of Zarathustra and his book, th e Avesta. During the third epoch, we have the revel ation of Hermes and what survives of his 42 texts, such as t he Emerald Tablet, the Poimandres, etc. Also during this third epoch we have the beginning of the monotheistic imp ulse of the Father, in the prophet Moses and his bo oks, the Pentateuch. During the fourth epoch, we have the Ch rist as greatest of all prophets and the books writ ten for Him, the New Testament, Acts and Letters of the Apostles and the Apocalypse, written by His initiate, St. J ohn. The esoteric seeds of this greatest of all revelations lies both in the Angelic Hierarchies of Dionysius t he Aeropagite and the so-called (by Joan of Arc) Book of God, which i s the preserved etheric tableu of the life of Chris t, which is seen by the various Saints and most recently by Sister E mmerich. With the diaspora of Jewish monotheism, we also hav e in the fourth epoch the renewed impulse of the Fa ther thru the prophet Mohammed and his book, the Koran. Altho ugh not discussed before in ISLAM (infra), Dr. Stei ner feels very strongly that the \"number of the beast\" from t he APOCALYPSE of St. John has risen in this culture of \"666\" in Islam. \"The streaming of Arabism towards Europe, wh erein Christianity became permeated by a teaching w hich could only make men fail to see their humanity with in themselves; where the Father dogma is controvert ed into naturalism.\" For Steiner, this renewed monotheistic impulse of the \"Father as natural laws\" is directl y in opposition to the Son dogma of Christianity and with it, of co urse, the Spirit dogma completing the Holy Trinity. Furthermore, this Islamic impulse is the direct inspiration of t he Sun Demon, Sorath, working thru the elemental fo rces of Ahriman. The date of the 666 appears first in the M ohammed revelation, set off in the shape of a cresc ent, as an opposition to Christianity, then again in 1332 with the genocide of the Templar impulse and will appea r for the third time at the end of our century in 1998. As the sun is the balance between the earth and moon, so is Ch ristianity the balance between the earthly forces of Ahriman and t he remaining over Old Moon forces of Lucifer. The C hrist"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"revelation is the middle of that sliding scale of e arthly materialism on one side and extreme lunar sp iritualism on the other side. For this reason, Islam will always be t he religious and cultural antithesis of Christianit y and Western culture. The fourth epoch is that time when a new impulse ar rives, in this case, in the two impulses of Christi anity and Islam. The fifth-sixth-seventh epochs will be a repetition at a higher level of the impulses given during the first three epochs (as observed by Harrison) wherein the esoter ic seeds will bear fruit within the exoteric plant of existing religious forms. There will be per-se no new religi ous forms arising but there will be renewed impulse s within the existing forms. For example, we see in the last century the new Chr istian impulse of the prophet Joseph Smith and his book of Mormon, revealed by the angel Moroni. Mormon cures many of the traditional ills of the Christian dogma , particulary those errors of the many Protestant fai ths. Remember, the Protestants have neither a proph et nor a book, there main purpose being to print the book (Bible) of the Christian revelation which the Catholics, li ke the ancient Jewish priests, kept in secret. This book of Mormon restores the body-soul-spirit tricotomy that was e liminated at the Church Council of Constantinople in 869 AD. It also teaches of the pre-existence of the soul in sp iritual worlds prior to incarnation at birth, which is a timely re newal of the Platonic doctrine over the Aristotelia n contribution to Catholic dogma. In addition, it teaches of the indi viduality of the three persons of the Holy Trinity, separate in person, but united in purpose within the Trinity. T hese three truthful and important doctrines which w ere put aside for good reasons by the early Catholic church, are now being restored during the Age of Michael. Because the religious revelation is inherently a cu ltural impulse also, it is appropriate to speak now and in the future of cultural evolution as the hallmark of the politi cal evolution of nations. For the first time in uni versity academics, we see this wisdom pour out in the recent book by S amuel P. Huntington called THE CLASH OF CIVILIZATIO NS AND THE REMAKING OF WORLD ORDER. Here he makes the case that the war of political systems and ideology is over and the wars of cultures has begun . The tectonic plates of the new world order are se ven or eight cultures; the Western, Eastern Orthodox, Islamic, L atin America, Japanese, Chinese, Hindu and possibly the African. These cultural groups are indeed close to our histo rical cultural epochs. The Eastern Orthodox is of c ourse, our next sixth cultural epoch of the Slavic/Russian. For the reasons discussed (infra) in ISLAM, the Latin Amer ican is not a cultural force since these peoples are the remainin g diaspora left over after their guiding archangel departed, during the last Atlantean Age. However, South America will indeed be a cultural force in the future seventh c ultural epoch. China is not regarded as a religious culture since its Mongolian race is a renewal of the seventh sub- race of the last Atlantean Age, which by definition is pre-religious . They are a culture of ancestor worshippers not go d worshipers. Guenon says that there is a Far-Eastern religious t radition that dates from the 6th century BC, this b eing the time of Lao Tzu and Confucius. Later, the tradition was sep arated into esoteric Taoism and exoteric Confuciani sm. It is forseable that the exoteric tradition could assume the Buddhist religion, as did Japan, and in this ca se China could be considered both a religious and cultural front. In any event, China is a huge cultural group which has a destiny with the first cultural group of the fifth Aryan root ra ce, the Hindus. Mr. Huntington's critics point out that there are s till significant political conflicts that derive fr om other than tradition, culture and religion. For example, what should have been a culturally united Western Europe certainly did not prevent itself from slaughtering millions of pe rsons during the last two World Wars. This is true, but the newly founded European Common Market should form a lastin g cultural community, provided the German archangel does not still seek to become the Spirit of the Age. Likewise, critics point to the war in Afghanistan w hich began as a war between Russian and Islamic cul tures but has since now divided into a war within Islam itself. T he Sunnis are fighting the Shiites, city Muslims ar e fighting the rural Muslims and at least four regional Islamic po wers are fighting for control. Again, this is also true, but over time, these internal conflicts will work themselves out and there will be a unified victor. This Afghan example points to a higher wisdom conce rning the nature of the archangels who control nati onal and cultural evolution. On the one side, the forces of Ahriman on the physical plane manifest division wit hin any human/religious community and on the other side, an gelic evolution proceeds from unity thru stages of diversity. Apart from Ahrimanic influences, diversity is the m anifestation of forces reflecting down from the hig her angelic hierarchies. The exoteric revelation given to the p eoples can only become diversified and every religi on reflects this principle. Within Christianity there is the ternary division i nto Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox and Protestan ts and we may now be witnessing a manifestation of a future s eptenary in the coming fourth impulse of the Mormon s. Within Islam, the division between Sunni and Shiite has ex isted since the first generation of Mohammed and I am sure we will live to see a third division emerging as Islam increases its sphere of influence. It is the faste st growing religion on the planet. In contrast, Hinduism has been esote rically sevenfold since its inception. Within its r anks there is even"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"a monotheism trend in the strict vedantic sects of Sankara in the 9th century, and the Islamic-Hindu t rend of Kabir and Guru Nanak in the 15th century. All religions n aturally diversify and the above Afgan criticism is no more than an observation of the normal evolution of archangel ic ternary and septenary evolution. When Huntington speaks of the present and future do minance of cultural and religious conflict, there i s no better example than what recently happened in the college town of Lincoln, Nebraska. A 39 year old gulf war r efugee married off his two age 13 and 14 daughters to two fellow Iraqi refugees, aged 28 and 34. The ceremony was performed in full Muslim tradition with cleric, fam ily and friends. When one of the young wives ran of f to a shelter, the city cops came in and put the two wives in fost er homes. Then, the police arrested five adults and charges are pending for crimes ranging from child abuse to rape . The two husbands who consumated their marriages a re facing rape charges and 50 years in prison. Now, that is r eligious and cultural conflict the critics should t alk about. II Another aspect to consider is what is the relations hip between this national/state entity impulse and religion? As we said before, the purpose of the 5th Aryan Age is tw o fold: first the development of religion and secon d the descent of manas into the physical plane. the descent of ma nas entails the rise of the state in opposition to the religious impulse. In the Atlantean age, there was no need for religio n because each person lived directly in the spiritu al world. During sleep, one could directly experience the hierarchie s of the spiritual world and during the day conscio usness, one was directed by the impulses that were received during the night. For this reason, the Atlantean age was a n age not of religion but of ancestor worship. This is clearly s een anthropologically in the remnants of the Atlant ean Age, for example in the Chinese and Polynesian cultures. Wit h the descent of manas during the 5th Aryan Age, ma nkind thru its intellect, drew away from the direct experience of the spiritual worlds and religion became necess ary for mankind to maintain a direct link with the spiritual worlds . The religious impulses from the book and the prop hets of the worlds great religions are great gifts from the god s to humanity. As i said before, the decline of ata vistic clairvoyance and the rise of the cognative faculty of mind are inversly porportional, as is also the c ase of the detachment from the 4 group souls and the rise of t he individual ego. The evolution of the nation/state as organizing pri nciple of cultures runs hand in hand with the desce nt of manas and counter to the principle of religion as organizing principle of cultures. As recent book review of a M arcel Gauchet's book THE DISENCHANTMENT OF THE WORLD says that \"som etime around 3000 BC, somewhere in Mesopotamia and Eqypt, a parting of the ways took p lace, with a social ordering that was seen as origi nating in individual human wills and individual human wills p erceived as themselves existing prior to the social bond (of religion) that holds them together.\" This impulse i n Eqypt came from the building of the pyramids whic h was the first time society was organized for a great purpos e. It is no coincidence that also around 3000 BC Dr. S teiner says that mankind suffered an incarnation of Lucifer. Although the place of this incarnation was in the f ar east, the impulse was quickly transplanted into the western Egyptian/Summerian area as the first experiment in the organizating principle of nation/state. (a simi lar experiment also took place in the 20th century with the transp lanted impulse of communism in Russia). The emergen ce of the nation/state is a luciferic impulse of ordering ind ividual human wills and the building of the pyramid s was the first rebellion against the principle of religion as orde ring individual human wills. These impulses are aga in inversly porportional in that great bell curve of human evol ution during the Aryan Age. The other pole of Monot heism as such is also an impulse towards the totalitarian na tion/state. III After long cycles of diversity of religious manifes tation, what brings about a unity of religions ? It is as Frithjof Schuon observed, the esoteric uni ty of all religious revelation that binds people to gether in eternal truths. Looking as he does at all religions in the shape of a pyramid with god at the apex, at the hig her esoteric level all religions converge towards the apex and below a t the exoteric level, all diverge. What leads back to unity is the gradual revelation of universal truths from the eso teric core or seed that lies behind every religious theophany. For Christianity, Spiritual Science and Anthroposophy r eveal the core of religious truths that will lead a ll Christians to a common ground for only in the universality of truth is there unnamimity. In Islam, we now see the esot eric core being pealed back thru the works of Henry Corbin an d S.H. Nasr. Esoterism is the path of truth that leads to religi ous unity. \"For the exoteric, God is primarily love d, for the esoteric, He is primarily known.\" This is why Dr. Steiner say s, \"Christianity has begun as a religion, for human ity (in our Aryan Age) was founded on religion. Yet religion mu st be replaced by wisdom, by knowledge. In so far a s religion rests upon faith and is not inflamed with the fire of knowledge, it is something that must be replaced in the course of humanity's progress.\" This replacement process will slowly occur because the goal of the Aryan fifth A ge is both: (1) the descent of Manas and (2) the septenary evol ution of religious forms, together. Manas gives kno wledge to the exoteric religious experience. \"From religion, mank ind evolves to wisdom glowed through by love.\""},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"If humanity evolves to achieve the final esoteric u nity of religions, why will Christianity become the universal final solution for all believers ? It is because of the a ppearance of Christ in the etheric beginning in yea r 1933. As Schuon correctly observes, the process which cau ses separation in the kingdoms of nature is reverse d for the kingdom of mankind. He says \"That which unites the being and more particulary the realized being to th e Divine Principle, is the intellect; that which separates t he world-or any microcosm-from the Principle is exi stance...the metaphysic proceeds exclusively from the intellect. ..the universality of esoterism is the same thing a s the universality of metaphysic and is itself of a unive rsal order, and not, like reason, of an individual order.\" This universal order of intelligence to which Schuon ref ers is the same Cosmic Intelligence of which the Is lamic tradition is fully aware thru the writings of Avicenna and Av erroes. In the Western tradition, Steiner refers to this as the descent of Manas on the physical plane during our A ryan Age which began in 869 AD. It represents the s acrifice of the body of an angelic being spread over humanity a nd as part of an universal order, its benefits will be available to everyone. In the future, Manas will become organic and transmitted thru heredity in the same way that the ego, astral body, etheric body and physical body are now given to mankind. When in the past, one had to rai se his consciousness to the level of the Cosmic Intelligen ce to receive the esoteric revelation, in the futur e this will be commonplace. However, therein lies the danger of th e unpurified astral body which receives the Manas r evelation. The purpose of the Christ revelation was to insure this occurs in a being infused with love. With the appearance of Christ in the etheric, those persons who attain the esoteric revelation, either now consciously thru their personal effort or, in the future, uncon sciously thru the descent of Manas, will find in th e etheric not the Buddha, the Confucius, nor the avatar, nor the Mait reya Bodhisattva, but the Christ being Himself, in all His Divine splendor. For persons of all different religious pe rsuasions, the experience will be the same, the per ception of the Christ being. This universal experience will finall y unite persons around the world in a common religi ous experience. Certainly, other persons will perceive other various spiritual beings of different angelic orders other than the Christ, but for these persons, the experience w ill not be universal, it will be as individual as i s the different beings experienced. Only with the experience of the Christ being will the religious experience be univ ersal. This is also the reason that the Christ being retur ned to the etheric plane and not to the physical pl ane as incorrectly predicted by those evangelists of the second coming . Had Christ returned in a human body to the physic al plane, the same problems would occur as did when He incarnated in Judea. Because of the \"diversity of Existence\", as Schuon observes, some people would accept Him and some wou ld not. The return to the physical plane could not accomplish a universal experience common to all hum anity for those who seek the religious truths. In the end, the varieties of all religious experien ce will be reduced to the single experience of the Christ in the etheric. Of course, to cement this man-God experien ce, Christ will again appear in the future sixth an d seventh cultural epochs within the astral and devachanic pl anes. DIONYSIUS THE AEROPAGITE On the hill of Mars, St. Paul lectured to the philo sophers and judges of the Aeropagus and two named c onverts left with him, one was that man Dionysius referred to in Acts 17:34. Who was this man that later wrote in a letter to Polycarp? \"What have you to say about the solar eclipse which occurred when the Savior was put on the cross.? At that time the two of us were in Heliopolis and we both witnessed the extraordinary phenomenon of the moon hiding the sun at a time that was out of season for their coming together, and from the 9th hour until evening it was supernaturally positioned in the middle of the sun. We saw the moon begin to hide the sun from the east, travel across to the other side of the sun, and return on its path so that the hiding and the restoration of the light did not take place in the same direction but rather in diametri cally opposite directions.\" So began the conversion of Dionysius to Christianit y. But his conversion was not from just that of a p agan to a believer, but, like to the experience of St. Paul o n the road to Damascus, from the depths of the paga n mysteries unto the most sacred heights of the essence of the Chris tian mysteries. Dr. Steiner lectured that Dionysius was a most profound pupil of the christian mysteries taught by St. Paul at the School of Athens. Although there i s no exoteric historical record of this first mystery school, it is certain that what was taught there was preserved in theCORPUS AREOPAGITICUM attributed to the Dionysuis, of Acts 17:34. These books include the Mystical Theology, t he Divine Names, the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy and the Celestial Hierarchy, plus a few collected letters. For the few centuries that passed after the death o f Paul and presumably Dionysius, the CORPUSremained hidden in the Christian East until first reference was made t o it in a report entitled \"Epistle of Innocent the Maronite"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"concerning a conference held with the Severians.\" T his report was based upon a debate between Hypatius of Ephesus and a group of Severians over the decrees o f the church Council of Chalcedon in 451. It had ha ppened at this church Council that, before he had arrived to defend himself, Nestorius was declared anathema by the church. The Council was called to declare heretic the doctr ines of Nestorius which have been historically grou ped under the term 'monophysite', meaning the single god-man natu re of the incarnate Logos. The duophysite nature, p roclaimed by Athanasius, meant that Jesus was both fully man and god, in one undivided nature, sort of two-in-on e. This Council preserved for the Roman church, the dogmas of the virgin birth of Mary as well as her place as the unblemished mother of Jesus. For Nestorius, both Ma ry and Jesus of Nazareth, were natural persons unti l the baptism by John in the Jordan, during which event, the Father incarnated in the person of Jesus. Jesus did not beget his divine nature until the baptism, after which He became monophysite, one nature as God-man. Severus (465-538) and his followers were east Syria n Christians of the Nestorian variety and any quoti ng of Dionysius in their defense also worked anathema aga inst Dionysius. In addition, several other passages in the volumes of the CORPUS dealing with the nature of th e trinity and the nature and number of sacraments w ere questionable in flavor and suffered the danger of a lso being called heretical to the Roman Council. To rectify this situation, a certain John of Scythopolis in Palesti ne began writing glosses of commentary on the CORPU S, explaining away the controversial passages with alt ernative meanings and where necessary, making edito rial changes. Another church father, Maximus the Confess or, also contributed significant explanation and de fense of the Dionysian texts. As a Eusebius also identified the Dionysius of Acts 17:34 as the first Bishop of Athe ns in his Ecclesiastical History, which was well respected it s accuracy of apostolic succession. Thus, over time and believing the all important link to St. Paul, the number of h igh ecclesiastical authorities coming from monaster ies all over the east in support, theCORPUS was saved from contagion with the Nestorian heresy and became orthodox theo logy in the Eastern church. So much so, that with the help of Maximus, the Lateran Council in 649 cited Dionys ius as a witness against monothelism. As the American scholar Jaroslav Pelikan commented, the first odyssey of the CORPUS AREOPAGITICUM was to be saved from \"the heretical East to the Orthodox E ast, the spirituality of this 'Maximized' Dionysius having been purged of any lingering suspicions about his orthod oxy, well before the time of his second odyssey, fr om the Orthodox East to the Catholic West.\" This second od yssey to the catholic west began in 827 when the by zantine Emperor Michael II (the Stammerer) sent a legation from Constantinople to the Frankish Emperor Louis t he Pious bearing gifts and a copy of the CORPUS AREOPAGITICU M. A certain arch-chaplain friend of Louis named Hilduin of the St. Denys monastery near Paris made the first western translation of the CORPUS into La tin in 838. This translation was unintelligible and later King Charles the Bald ordered John Scotis Eriugena to ma ke another translation which was finished in 862. John, coming from the schools of Ireland, had suddenly appeared in the court of Charles in 847 and was quickly appointed head of the palace school. Although not known to travel to Greece and the east, he was well versed in greek and soon beca me very influential in the court. The lack of imagi nation that plagued the translation of Hilduin, soared in the m ind of John, who had a kindred spirit with Dionysiu s. He understood the nuances of greek, wrote annotations and in his own theological writings, highly praised the CORPUS, which advanced both author and translator w ith the sudden popularity of the texts. Now for the first time the problem of the PSEUDO-Di onysius came into existence. In his translation of the monastery's text, Hilduin also wrote an hagiography and identified Dionysius with St. Dionysius (or De nys), the first bishop of Paris. Now, there were three Dionysius, t he first was Dionysius the Aeropagite of Acts 17:54 and Eusebiun Bishop of Athens; second, the Dionysius id entified by Dr. Steiner, who was the pupil of St. P aul at the Academy of Athens, and the third, the martyred Bish op of Paris and patron saint of France who died som e 100 years later than any contemporary of St. Paul. I would offer the following explanation. First, wit h Dr. Steiner's identification of Dionysius as a pu pil of St. Paul, this is most likely a well kept esoteric secret of the medieval monastic life, particularly of the Cis tercian variety. I may refer the reader to the famous painting of Raph ael of the Academy of Athens and ask why not the tw o figures actually being St. Paul and Dionysius and not the p resumed Aristotle and Plato. Second, we have it fro m good sources, notably, Babai the Great, who in the 7th c entury, wrote commentary on the DIVINE NAMES andcal led its author \"Saint Dionysius disciple of Paul.\" (Babai 5 69-628 was a wealthy Persian christian who studied literature and went to Nisibis and studied medicine. He later beca me the head of the monastery of Mar Abraham on Mt. Izla and was considered the greatest divine theologian of th e Eastern Nestorian church and has been considered the first sufi) The Academy of St. Paul at Athens was the first eso teric christian mystery school that bore the wisdom of the risen Christ as experienced by Paul on the road to Damasc us. In addition, Paul most likely spent some of his three years in the desert in the monastery at Qumran where he lear ned the angelology of the Essenes which was passed down from the master Zarathas during the Babylonian exile. In the Jewish tradition, Paul's teachings, preserved by his pupils, bore the ancient wisdom of both the celestial hiera rchy as well as the divine names. As is well known in any initiatic"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"school, the hierophant bears the name of its founde r and each succeeding master continues this traditi on. That the first Dionysius of Acts 17:34 died and passed his a stral and etheric mantle to his successor is presum ed tradition. That this successor bore the same name, had no hist orical biography until he moved to Paris, where he became bishop and martyr is also likely (similar to what t he risen Lazarus accomplished in Ephesus). As is an cient custom, the church of St. Denys bears both the name and the relics of its founder. Most likely also, the monas tic order at this church preserved the oral teaching of the Athens sc hool for 700 years until a written copy of the CORP US AREOPAGITICUM magically appeared in 838 from the ea st. Unfortunately, the priesthood at St. Denys chur ch were incapable of giving the divine texts their rig htful understanding. Fortunately, for western chris tianity, John Eriugena was the right man in the right place to wa ter this seed from Constantinople. A similar seed b lossomed in Europe 600 years later when Gemistos Plethon again came over from Constantinople with the major greek texts to the court of Cosimo De'Medici, whence began the ren aissance. The second odyssey, from Orthodox East to Catholic West, was now complete with the new translation and publication by John, who said of these texts, \"The Mystical divinity ran across England like deer.\" We ll, the current was more underground that aboveground, since very f ew references to the CORPUS were made during the ne xt several centuries. However, as we have heard before , the 12th century was a mini-renaissance. In 1165 a certain John Sarazin, a monk at the St. Denys monastery, ma de a new translation of the CORPUS with commentary which became dedicated to \"Master, John of Salisbury\" als o known as John of Chartres. In the KARMIC RELATIONSHIPS lectures ( Vol.III ) Dr. Steiner spok e about the great Platonic revival that occurred at the School of Chartres thru the monks of the Cistercian order. Great teachers like Alain de Lille, Bernardus Sylv estris and Bernard of Chartres taught of the creative powers o f the Goddess Natura as a living being and of the G oddesses of the seven Liberal Arts, who also, were real, living spiritual beings. Although the real founders of th e Cistercian order, St. Bernard of Clairvaux and William of Sain t Thierrim, were not greatly influenced by the CORP US, it flourished in Chartres and poured itself into the O rder. And after the death of these great teachers, Dr. Steiner said, \"The last great ones of the School of Chartres had just arrived in the spiritual world...and at the beginning of the 13th century there took place one of the most important exchanges of ideas behind the scenes of human evolution, an exchange of ideas between those who had carried up the old Platonism, inspired by spiritual vision, from the School of Chartres into the spiritual world, and those on the other hand who were preparing to carry Aristotelianism down to earth, as the great transition to bring about a new spiritua lity that was to flow into the evolution of mankind in the future....It was a truly living cooperation, the great Alain de Lille (1120-1202) sent his pupil down to continue through the Dominican Order the task that was now to pass over to Aristotelianism.\" With the Dominicans, Albert the Great and St. Tomas Aquinas, the great age of scholasticism began, whi ch was that world historic perfect blending of Plato and Aristo tle, faith and reason, and for the future, faith an d science. The fact that St. Thomas made over 1700 references to theCOR PUS AREOPAGITICUM and that (another celestial architect) St. Bonaventure called Dionysius \"the pr ince of mystics\" has forever made the CORPUS dogma for the western catholic church. The CORPUS also found its way into the great mystic s of the middle ages, including Master Eckhart, Tau ler, Ruysbroek, Gerson, Nicholas of Cusa, Denis the Cart husian, St. John of the Cross, Francis of Osuna and Harphius. After that second burst of Platonic revival occurre d into the 15th century renaissance, Marsilio Fican o took time from translating his Hermetic and Greek texts and m ade a new translation and commentary in 1492. Taken up by the Florentine Academy, Dionysius again 'spread like de er' across Europe along with the translated Gemisto s Plethon texts reaching even Protestant countries like Germa ny and England. It was reported that the thrice-gre at Trithemius, Abbott of Sponhein, became completely absorbed in c opying and translating Dionysius. I can imagine thi s kindred spirit going absolutely bonkers over the Celestial Hierarchy such that the Abbot never touched ground again. Unfortunately, with the spread of the humanist Prot estant reformation, the second odyssey with the pro blem of the PSEUDO-Dionysius began in earnest. The first critic , Lorenzo Valla (1407-1457) in his New testament gl osses claimed that Dionysius probably never wrote anythin g at all. For him the term 'Aeropagite' denoted a j udge (which is very true) and not a theologian and Valla felt w rote that the reference to observing the eclipse of the sun in the \"letter to Polycarp\" (above quoted) was a blatant f iction. Later in 1504 the well published and schola rly Erasmus published the Valla Annotations along with his bibl ical works. For this he was criticized by catholic theologians as if it was his own opinion."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"By the time of the Reformation, scholars took sides and battle lines drawn. The young Martin Luther fa vorably studied the CORPUS, as did any young monk. However, in 1519 during the Leipzig Disputation, John Eck u sed the CORPUS as argument and evidence for the apostolic o rigin of papal legitimacy. Then , the dispute becam e a Luther Project. As we know, Luther called the Pope the 'an tichrist' and wrote that the best way to destroy th e papal hierarchy was to attack the catholic mass and its s acraments. Dionysius in his Ecclesiastical Hierarch y, created a hierarchy of church offices and sacramental rites w hich correspond to the nine levels of angels presen ted in the Celestial Hierarchies. This was a most brilliant Pl atonic expression of the ancient wisdom, 'as above, so below.' Luther in his efforts to condemn and destroy papal legitimacy preferred a later dating for the CORPUS, depriving it of any support of the early apostolic fathers. The PSEUDO dispute was a perfect bootstrap to hang on. He wrote , \"I admonish you to shun like the plague that 'Mystical Theology' of Dionysius and similar books that cont ain such idle talk\" and called Dionysius \"most pernicious; he Pla tonizes more than he Christianizes.\" The real key in this attack lies equally with the r eformist protestant mentality against the ancient w isdom and the Platonic Renaissance revival begun by Ficino, Della Mirandola and Cusa, which even a humanist englishm an like John Colet, into \"Plato himself.\" Of course, that o ther polemicist, John Calvin, later grabbed the oth er bootstrap and railed against the illicit knowledge of god and ang els presented in the Celestial Hierarchies. To this day, it is very sad indeed, that the protestants have rejected the Platonic wisdom given forth by Dionysius, the Ciste rcians and the Renaissance masters, such that there is today, no c elestial angelology in their theology, or most impo rtantly, in their prayers.. THE CELESTIAL HIERARCHIES Four of his writings survived to this day, namely, CONCERNING THE HEAVENLY HIERARCHY; CONCERNING THE DIVINE NAMES; CONCERNING THE ECCLESI ASTICAL HIERARCHY; and CONCERNING MYSTICAL THEOLOGY. His most esoteric wor k, THE CELESTIAL HIERARCHY forms the backbone of the Western Esoteric tradition. In it h e names the Celestial Hierarchy as follows: 1. Seraphim 2. Cherubim First Triad/Hierarchy 3. Thrones 4. Dominations (Kyriotetes) 5. Virtues (Dynamis) Second Triad/Hierarchy 6. Powers (Exusiai) 7.Principalities (Archai) 8. Archangels Third Triad/Hierarchy 9. Angels (an ancient source comments as follows:) \"The angels are divided into nine choirs and form t hree hierarchies, hence the \"angelic world is prese nted to our view as a magnificent army ranged in the most admir able order.\" \"The first hierarchy is composed of the Seraphim, t he Cherubim and the Thrones; the second comprises t he Dominations, the Virtues and the Powers; the third is formed of the Principalities, the Archangels and the Angels. Each choir has a different office as will be shown in the following outline, necessarily brief, since the scope of this little work does not permit more. But let us ferven tly beg each one to share with us the particular gr ace with which it is endowed. \"The Seraphim come first. Their very name means ard or, and they are consumed with the fire of Divine L ove of \"which they are the created representations.\" This burning love keeps them ever close to God's Throne and they bear love and light to the lesser choirs of angels. O ar dent Seraphim, enkindle in our hearts, by the virtu e of the Divine Blood, the sacred flame of the love of God with whi ch you are consumed. \"The Cherubim are next. Their name signifies \"fulln ess of knowledge.\" They are characterized by a deep insight into God's secrets and they truly possess the fullness o f the divine science of heaven. They enlighten the lesser choirs of angels and are to them the Voice of Divine Wisdom. O bright Cherubim, instruct us more to appreciate t he power of the Precious Blood, in the excellent science of the saints, that we may also praise and glorify God wi th you. \"The Thrones form the last choir of the first' hier archy which is the closest to the Divine Majesty. T hey are so styled because their main characteristics are submission a nd peace. God rests upon the Thrones and in a certa in manner conveys His Spirit by these angels, who in turn com municate it to the inferior angels and to men. We s hould pray to the Thrones especially for peace. O Blessed Thrones , obtain for us peace through the Divine Blood, tha t peace which the world cannot give, which comes from submi ssion to God's will in our regard. \"The second hierarchy of angels is more specificall y devoted to the management of human affairs. It op ens with the Dominations, so called because \"they rule over all the angelic orders charged with the execution of th e commands of the Great Monarch.\" Therefore, these bright spirits make known to us the commands of God and their mai n virtue is"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"zeal for the maintenance of the King's authority. l et vs remember them when seeking God's will and inv oke them in our perplexities. O holy angels, pray to God for vs , that we may ever be faithful to His holy will in all the circumstances of our earthly pilgrimage. \"To the choir of Virtues has been confided the duty of carrying out the orders issued by the Dominatio ns. To them is attributed strength and we should seek their assist ance in combatting the enemies of our salvation. \"i t is through them also,\" says Bovdon, \"that God governs the seas ons, the visible heavens and the elements in genera l, although angels of the lower hierarchy have charge of them.\" Let us therefore have recourse to the Virtues in a ll extraordinary necessities of mind and body, as well as in times o f public afflictions. O mighty Intelligences, help vs always, in virtue of the Divine Blood, to accomplish with pers everance whatever duty has been entrusted to vs by God's will. \"The Powers,\" someone has said, \"are the favorites among mortals.\" They are appointed in a special way to fight against the evil spirits and to defeat their wicke~ d plans. \"When we see storms gathering either in th e Church or in the State, machinations to resist those who are wor king for the glory of God, extraordinary conspiraci es to defeat some great good which is being planned for some dio cese, city or country, then it is that we ought to perform frequent devotions in honor of these Powers of heav en, that they may overturn and destroy all the migh t and miserable plotting of hell.\" (Boudon). O invincible Pourers, in virtue of the Divine Blood, defend us against the attacks of the devil, the world and the flesh and m ake vs victorious against that triple power. \"The Principalities preside over the third hierarch y. Their duties are executive in regard to the visi ble world of men. They also guard the nations of the earth and St. Th omas says of them: \"The execution of the angelic mi nistrations consists in announcing divine things. Now, in the e xecution of any action there are beginners and lead ers; this-the leadership-belongs to the Principalities.\" We shoul d then invoke them for the protection of our countr y that it may realize the designs of God upon it. Those who have to exercise any authority should honor these blesse d spirits in a special way; they would receive from them graces of light and strength in the discharge of their dutie s. Sovereign Principalities, in virtue of the Divine Blood, gove rn also our souls and our bodies, and assist vs in the attainment of our eternal destinies. \"The Archangels are entrusted with the more importa nt missions to men. They are also given as guardian s to great personages, such as the Holy Father, Cardinals, Bis hops, Rulers of States, and others who have special work to do for the glory of God upon earth. They protect the C hurch under the leadership of St. Michael and defen d it against its enemies. Let us not forget them when praying fo r the triumph of the Church, that these celestial s pirits may safeguard its interests and watch over our Supreme Pontiff. Noble Archangels, we beg you to aid us alw ays, that profiting by the Divine Blood, we may ever live in faith, hope and charity, and die as true children o f our Holy Mother the Church. \"The Angels, specially so called, close the last ch oir of the spirits of light. They are the ordinary messengers sent to men and from their ranks our own guardian angels ar e usually chosen. They mirror in a very particular way the goodness of God toward vs. They are ever ready to g o wherever the will of God sends them, and they min ister to all, just and sinner alike. They have a true sense of va lues and they know that to serve God in any capacit y is a very great honor. Let vs frequently invoke their help as they are most happy to be of service to us. As the y are our lifelong companions, we shall speak of them more at length later. Most holy Angels be ever for vs the guardians of our safety and salvation, and since we were redeeme d by the Divine Blood, obtain for vs the grace of f inal perseverance.\" THE ADAM APOCALYPSE It would be easy to assume that the angelology of D ionysius derived from St. Paul and thus from the te achings of Christ himself. Of course, we know that St. Paul's conversion at Damascus occurred after the death and resurrection, so Paul had no physical contact with Christ. St. Pa ul also appears to be the only disciple to specific ally mention the names of certain orders of the angels in his writin gs. So it would seem that the other apostles were n ot his source. The key to his sources may come from the Essene Com munity at Qumran. A recently rediscovered manuscript, one copy in Eth iopian and one in Arabic, entitled THE HEXAMERON containing the ADAM APOCALYPSE, bears the signature of our great Church Father, Epiphanius, Bishop of Cyprus. We know that he was closely connected with early Esoteric Christianity from his church writing s which so confuse the scholarly commentators. They are confus ing because, like Plato, he carefully weaves the oc cult truths with exoteric facts, bewildering the historian buy leaving between the line occult keys to the inquiri ng mind. In the ADAM APOCALYPSE, he writes, \"In the beginning, on the first day, God created he aven and the earth, water, air, and fire, the invis ible spirits, that is, the angels: the Thrones, the Dominations, the Princ ipalities and Powers, the Cherubim and Seraphim, al l castes and orders of spirits.\" In addition, the ADAM APOCALYPSE described three or ders of angels called heavens comprising ten hosts. The first heaven contains the \"beautiful\", the Cherubim and the Seraphim, who carry the \"throne\" of God. I n the second"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"heaven, three more orders dwell, called the dominio ns (masters) led by Gabriel, the thrones led by Rap hael and the sultans, led by Syrial, who blows a trumpet. Betwee n the first and second heaven is a fourth host call ed the powers and led by St. Michael. In the third heaven three m ore hosts of angels are described, being the Judges , the archangels and the angels. Above the throne of God floats the Trinity. This angelology of Epiphanius exactly parallels the celestial hierarchy of Dionysius except for the na mes of certain angelic hosts. Scholars recognize the ADAM APOCALYP SE as the oldest known source to date of the elabor ate ordering of angels, the Arabic version being the ol dest text. We know that it was written after the li fe of St. Paul because it refers to angels blowing trumpets \"as de scribed in the vision of John, that is, the Apocaly pse\"(New Testament). However, to ascribe its authorship to E piphanius (375 A.D.) is unlikely because he was not an apocalyptic writer. His task was to preserve occult traditions from the censorship and liturgical dogm a evolving from the triumph of Nicene Christianity in 325 A.D. As G.R. S. Mead so intuitively observes \"Epiphaniu s knew of an ancient tradition which declared that the Christ ians originally derived from the Essenes, that Jesu s himself had been an Essene and that this Church Father wished t o safeguard the doctrinal tradition now stereotyped by the ecumenical decisions at Nicaea.\" During early Christianity, the writings of Dionysiu s were hidden from the profane until the 6th Centur y and for this reason, modern scholars say that he never wrote the manuscripts that bear his name. (It distresses me to read in a recent book on Angelology that the author says that Dionysius, \"pretended to be Dionysius the Areopagi te, the first century Greek who was converted by St. Paul at Athe ns...until around 1450 A.D. he was discovered to be a fraud ...therefore he is now called the pseudo-Areopagite \".)The only difference between the ADAM APOCALYPSE and the CELESTIAL HIERARCHY is in the names of certain angelic hosts known as the \"beautiful, masters, jud ges and the sultans\". Jewish angelology as reflected in the ir Quabbalah derived from Chaldean traditions durin g the Babylonian captivity, adding only Hebrew names to a pre-existing angelic order. About 100 B.C., the Es sene Teacher of Righteousness (Jeschu Ben Pandira) merge d the Chaldean mystery stream of Zarathustra with t he Jewish mystery stream of Melchizedek and Abraham to prepar e for the birth event of the two Jesus children. It seems likely that Epiphanius, while using the Chaldean names of his orders of angelic hosts was trying to preserve an esoteric tradition extent in the Essene Community that survi ved until the destruction of Qumran by the Romans i n 68 A.D. Saul the Pharisee, after his conversion and in prep aration for his many years of teaching, was instruc ted by the Essenes to Hellenize the names of the hosts in the celestial hierarchy because the Greek and Roman wor ld were not familiar with the Arabic names of the autocratic st ate dignitaries. Only after the publication of the Dead Sea Scrolls will scholars connect the Pauline Community with th e Essene Community at Qumran. Several authors such as Alan F. Segal, J.A. Fitzmyer, and N.A. Dahl now suspect that St. Paul , especially in the CORINTHIANS, eith er is directly quoting or otherwise relying on scrolls re ceived from Qumran. THE CHALDEAN PLANETARY SPHERES Against this background of the Christian Church Fat hers commenting on the angelic hierarchy, there rem ained over the so-called pagan authors commenting on the plane tary hierarchy as revealed through the ancient myst eries. The rise of Christianity was inversely proportional to the demise of the ancient mysteries. The Empero r Julian the Apostate was initiated into the Mithraic Mysteries and after his death, there was no longer any trace of the ancient mysteries in either the Roman Rulers nor Christian clergy. In 399 A.D. the Emperor Theodosius issued h is famous edict abolishing the mysteries, \"Whatever privileges were conceded by the ancient l aws to the priests, ministers, prefects, hierophant s of sacred things, or by whatsoever name they may be designate d, are to be abolished henceforth, and let them not think that they are protected by a granted privilege when thei r religious confession is known to have been condem ned by law.\" The early Christians destroyed the temples, burnt t he libraries and broke the statues and relics of th e Ancient Gods. The bearers of the occult mystery wisdom of Osiris, Mithras Serapis, Demeter, Appolo, Dionysius, and M ani went underground not to resurface until the 17th Century with the publications of the Rosicrucian manifesto s and the 18th Century Masonic rituals. Simultaneously, the exoteric scientific wisdom of t he Greeks steamed into the Academy of Edessa in Syr ia. This school was the last vestige of the arts, music, log ic, math, geometry, medicine and other Liberal Arts of Plato and Aristole. In 489 A.D. the Emperor Zeno closed this school and drove out all its students and teachers. With the arts and sciences of Hellenistic wisdom finally closed t o the West by the Roman Emperors and Western Christ ian Church, the center of the ancient wisdom transforme d to the Persian Academy of Jundi Sabur. Henceforth , the advancement of the arts, sciences and medicine was the dominion of the Arabic culture. The first and greatest exposition of the planetary hierarchy was a long poem by Martianus Cappella ent itled, DE NUPTIIS PHILOLOGIAE et. seq. It was written about 5 00 A.D. in North Africa and was widely distributed and recognized as an occult textbook late into the 19th . century. It forms the cosmology later revived by the great Arab"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"scholar, Avicenna and like the CHEMICAL NUPTIALS of Christian Rosencrutz is the allegorical story of a marriage performed in heaven. Cappella tells of the courtship of Mercury and Phil ologia that travels up through the planetary sphere s to the castle of Zeus, where their wedding takes place. During th e journey, the Gods of the planets are identified. The planetary spheres are moved by the Muses emitting the sounds of \"Music of the Spheres\". Also, the intervals betw een the planetary spheres are correlated with the Pythagore an musical intervals of the seven tone scale. All i s harmony of music and number in the classic Pythagorean sense. The Gods and their spheres were: Urania Fixed Stars (Zodiac) Polyhymnia Saturn Euterpe Jupiter Erato Mars Melpomene Sun Terpsichore Venus Calliope Mercury (Cyllenium) Clio Moon Thalia Earth As we shall develop later, this ninefold planetary hierarchy will correspond to the ninefold angelic h ierarchy of Dionysius. It represents the ancient seven Chaldean planets with the addition of earth at the bottom a nd the sphere of the zodiac at the top. The doctrine of the Ascent o f the soul through seven successive stages of being or consciousness originates with the Babylonian myth o f Tammuz and Ishtar and is memorialized in the seve n steps of the Ziggarat. Later, this doctrine appears in the P OIMANDRES of Hermes, the royal arches of Enoch, the seven heavens of St. John's REVELATION and Mohammed's NIG HT JOURNEY TO HEAVEN with the angel Gabriel. After the birth of Christ, we see the doctrine of t he planetary spheres accepted by the Christian Gnos tics at the School of Alexandria. The Demiurge of Saturn gave b irth out of himself to six sons or aeons, who toget her became the seven planetary spirits of the created material world. They are as described by Origen, Ialdabaoth------ Saturn Iao------------- - Jupiter Sabaoth-------- Mars Adonaios------ Sun Astaphaios----- Venus Ailoaios --------- Mercury Oraios ----------- Moon Unfortunately, the treasures of Gnostic wisdom, bea ring a mixture of the Christos and Greek Platonics have not survived since the destruction of the great library of Seraphium once by Emperor Theodosius and his cr azed Christians and late again Caliph Omar in 641 A.D. t o preserve the dominance of the Academy at Jundi Sa bur. THREE CULTURAL STREAMS In retrospect, the transition from paganism to West ern Christianity took place over a remarkably short period of time. This push came as the result of at least thre e very strong impulses. On the one side there was t he impulse of exoteric Christianity which Steiner says came from the time spirit or Archai of the Greek nation. This Archai could have ascende d to the rank of Spirit of Form or Power, but inste ad, he sacrificed himself and became the missionary, the i nspirer of out- spreading exoteric Christianity. Th rough his efforts the religion of Christianity spread through out Europe and He became the inspirer for the Gothi c Cathedrals, Byzantine and Romanesque art. In addition, the seve ral folk-spirits of Europe became the servants of t his Christ Spirit and because of this, they worked in various ways in the many different cultures instead of in a unified way in one particular culture. This exoteric spirit of Christianity worked behind the scenes and with Him, it may be said, so did the bodies of the Christ. This remarkable fact was explained by Stein er in The Principle of Spiritual Economy (1909). \"W hen Christ left the material world, innumerable copies of His etheric and astral bodies were preserved and came i nto being. These were destined to be woven into the bodies of human beings suited to disseminate Christianity.\" O ver the course of time, certain persons, regardless of nati onality, who were mature and suitable enough, had t hese copies of the etheric and astral bodies engrafted into their souls. This process has a correspondence to distinct perio ds in the development of Christianity. For example, the etheric body being the bearer of memory, effected the early church fathers such as St. Irenaeus, Papias and St . Augustine with emphasis on memory of and a direct physical te aching of the Christ event. Missionaries who also r eceived a copy of the etheric body of Christ, such as Columba n, Gallus and St. Patrick, taught memory of the phy sical event"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"and the rules and covenants of the new Christian or der. This period of the spread of the etheric body of Christ ended about the 9th Century with John Scotus Erigena. Beginning the 10th Century, the copies of the astra l body of Christ began to circulate in the leading Christian personalities of Europe. Being the seat of the emot ions, these copies of the astral body caused great emotional sentiments, fervor and zeal, and a direct feeling o f the Christ. This exalted devotion was evident in such persons as St. Francis of Assisi and Elisabeth of Thuringen an d also in the German mystics, Meister Eckhart and J ohannes Tauler. The thinking function of the astral body of Christ produced the great teachers of scholasticis m, Albert the Great,St. Thomas Aquinas and Cardinal Nicholas of C usa. They implanted into traditional Christian dogm a, the capacity to think with analytical penetrating logic derived from Aristotle. This evolution of Christianity corresponding with t he etheric and astral bodies of Christ, through the process of spiritual economy, came to an end in the 15th Centu ry. With the onset of the Fifth Cultural Epoch, man kind required individual reliance and development of the personal ego. These greatly inspired personalities of early Christianity and the Middle Ages are a tribute to the past and a rarity of the present. THE PERSIAN ACADEMY As a polar opposite to the ubiquitous stream of exo teric Christianity, a second influence arose in Per sia that was called by Steiner the \"culture of 666 A.D.\" (How Do I Find the Christ, 1918). Briefly stated, the four th cultural epoch occurred from 747 B.C. to 1413 A.D., being th e astrological cycle of Aries lasting 2160 years. T he mid-point of this epoch (-747 plus 1080) was reached in the y ear 333 A.D. \"The mystery of Golgotha preceded the middle point of this epoch by 333 years, i.e. by just as m any years prior to this point, as years after it, c ertain spiritual powers intended to direct the evolution of mankind into quite different channels from those into it wa s ultimately lead by the mystery of Golgotha\". Thus, 333 years a fter this midpoint is the year 666 A.D., the same y ear as the number of the beast (Sorath) in the APOCALYPSE of S t. John. The intention of these spiritual powers wa s to instill in exoteric Western Christianity a Hellenistic-Gnos tic inspired natural science that would cut off man kind's spiritual path to achieve Manas, Buddhi and Atma in future cu ltural epochs. The time for the endowment upon humanity of what St einer calls the consciousness soul was destined for the Fifth Cultural epoch (age of Pisces) beginning in 1413. W ithout firmly grounding humanity in the Christ impu lse of exoteric Christianity, the human ego would not be f ree at this later epoch to develop as intended by t he Spirits of Form. This neo-Persian influence was centered in the Acad emy of Gondhishapur (Jundi Sabor) and it reached it s peak in the year 666 A.D. Steiner says that all the teacher s within the Academy were inspired by Luciferic-Ahr imanic spiritual powers whose purpose was to instill pre-m aturally into mankind the consciousness soul inspir ed by the Hellenistic sciences. As discussed above, the fruit of Greek wisdom in the sciences and medicine were not Christ inspired because the Archai of the Greek nation sac rificed himself to become the impulse of Exoteric C hristianity. Thus, the great intellectual achievements of this l eading spirit of the Greek culture were turned back against him by the impulse of the Persian Academy. Beginning in the 12th Century, the scholarly scienc es of the Arabs were translated into Latin and carr ied to the West. Until the rise of the Florentine Academy in t he 15th Century, all Greek texts available to Weste rn scholars came from Arabic sources. Thus, the entire natural sciences and particularly medicine came to the West ern universities in an Arabic form influenced by the po wers of Lucifer-Arihiman. As a response to this pow erful influence, in the 13th Century Albert Magnus and St . Thomas Acquinas in Paris began teaching the logic and natural science of Aristotle in a new form saturated with t he Christian dogma of the classic Church Fathers, t he likes of St. Augustine, Dionysius, St. Jerome, St. Clement, Orig en, Eusebius, and Tertullian. The scholastics waged intellectual war upon great Arab philosophers and physicians Avi cenna, Averroes and Moses Maimonides. Scholasticism was the burning torch of Western Exoteric Christianity in the otherwise dark Middle Ages waiting for the d awn of the consciousness soul in the Fifth Cultural Epoch comm encing the year 1413. In fact, the tide did turn. In 1439, the stranger n amed Gemistos Plethon silently arrived at the court of Cosimo de Medici with original Greek texts of Plato and vario us neo-Platonic authors. In addition he had preserv ed major Hermetic texts and the Kabbalah. When Marsilio Fici no was commissioned to translate these original tex ts, the Arabic sources were bypassed and thence began the R enaissance and the emergence of the consciousness s oul. ESOTERIC CHRISTIANITY The third influence at work in Europe during the Fo urth Cultural Epoch was the special mission of Esot eric Christianity beginning with Dionysius at the School of St. Paul at Athens. Steiner says in the GOSPEL OF ST. JOHN, \"This esoteric Christianity has always been fostere d alongside the outer Christian exoteric teaching.. .(ST.)Paul founded an Esoteric school. the director of which w as Dionysius, the Areopagite, mentioned in the acts of the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Apostles. In this Christian esoteric school at Athe ns which was directly founded by Paul himself, the purest Spiritual Science was taught.\" Steiner further corresponds that in the same way th e Archai of the Greek nation sacrificed himself to become the impulse of exoteric Christianity, the Archangel of the Celtic peoples sacrificed Himself to become the inspiring spirit of Esoteric Christianity. This particular fo lk spirit upon completing his mission as an archang el had the opportunity to rise to the level of an Archai or Sp irit of the Age. However, he renounced, he remained behind so as to become the servant of the various Archai that wo uld arise in the future Europe. And no matter how t he various Archai would work, no matter their particular task, the guiding spirit of Esoteric Christianity would remain a source and inspirer of the ancient wisdom surviving in the various mystery centers. It goes without saying that the streams of Esoteric Christianity are intentionally hidden. B.C.J. Liev egoed in his book, Mystery Streams in Europe (1982) identified f our major currents which he describes in a general overview: WESTERN, originating in the mysteries of ancient At lantis, trailing through Hibernia and Celtic Christ ianity, known as the King Arthur Stream, which purpose was to develop the Buddhi impulse. EASTERN, originating in the five Post-Atlantis fift h sub- races, known as the Grail Stream, transplant ed by Joseph of Arimathea from Judea to Glastonbury, which purpo se was to develop the Manas impulse. In 869 A.D., the East-West impulses united together with the deed of Parsifal, who as a knight of King Arthur, became King of the Grail. NORTHERN, originating in the very ancient mysteries of Hyperborea, trailing through the Germanic and Scandinavian Drotten and Trudi mysteries, known as the Vidar Stream, which purpose was to develop the ego impulse. SOUTHERN, originating in the ancient mysteries of L emuria, trailing through the Egyptian- Hebraic myst eries, Hermetic, King Solomon and Templar mysteries later known as the Rosicurcian Stream, which purpose was to develop the Atma impulse. With the coming of the Michael Age in 1879 and the end of the Kali Yuga in 1898, all four esoteric str eams came to an end. In 1923 a new mystery center was chosen and now all four impulses work towards a unity in the new mysteries. A most unique feature of the efforts of these two s pirits of Exoteric and Esoteric Christianity is tha t they do not seem to work together. In fact, the Exoteric spirit work s against the Esoteric impulse to the point of deat h and extinction. Consider this. During the Albigensian Crusade, orde red by Pope Innocent III, (1208), the troops of mil itary leader Simon de Montfort swept through southern France wit h a vengeance. At Bram, he took a hundred hostages, cut off their noses and upper lips and blinded all but one who led a procession to the castle. At Lavaur, nine ty captured knights were ordered hung, then impatiently, they w ere stabbed to death. Inside this castle, 400 Catha rs were found and burned alive. At Minerve, the entire captured a rmy as well as all the Cathar parfaits, were burned alive on a flaming pyre. After the death of Pope Innocent, Pop e Gregory IX ordered the Dominicans to expunge the remaining Cathar sanctuaries. Over the next fifty years, the Inquisition burned perhaps 5,000 heretics, sometime s exhuming the bodies and publicly burning the bones of those luck y enough to have escaped the funeral pyre the first time. Among the lost treasures of the Cathars is believed to be the Holy Grail of Esoteric Christianity. Dur ing the siege of the mountain top castle of Montsegur four monks sli pped out at night, lowered themselves on rope down the rock cliffs and made their getaway to the caves at Sabar thes. The next day, March 16, 1244, the Inquisition marched 200 Cathar monks out of the captured castle and burned them alive. This particular episode of extinction by the Popes and Dominican Inquisition lasted over 113 years. Be ginning with the razing of the Essene Monastery at Qumran in 68 A.D. by the Romans, through the death by burning of Jacques De Molay on March 14, 1314 at the Cathedral of Notr e Dame, we see the great efforts of Esoteric Christ ianity martyred at the stake by the leading personalities of Exoteric Christianity. Of course, this veil cove ring the historical forms of Exoteric Christianity has been penetrated by the evil of Lucifer-Ahriman which even this grea t spirit cannot escape. TRACES IN MEDIEVAL ART Although the Great God Pan is dead, he rules us fro m the grave. Throughout early Christianity, there i s one remarkable truth, the icons of pagan art are transf ormed into Christian symbols. The sites of pagan te mple sacrifice are transformed into Christian Churches and the occ ult wisdom of the mysteries is preserved in the str eam of Esoteric Christianity. Consider that the Basilica o f St. Peters Church in Rome was the site of a templ e dedicated to Mithras. The Cathedral at Chartres was the site of an Hibernian mystery center and later a Druid cave sanctuary containing the Black Madonna. The Abbey at Glastonb ury, England was also an ancient site of an Hiberni an mystery center before St. Joseph of Arimathea recei ved his charter and twelve hides from the Pagan Kin g Arviragus."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"There is not a better example of how pagan idols we re transformed into Christian symbols than the two stone slabs on the walls of the Visigoth Church (7th. century) at Burgos, Spain.

Prior to the 10th Century, the most elaborate paint ings occur as the triumphal arches in Santa Marie A ntiqua and San Prassede in Rome. At Santa Marie Antiqua, different hierarchies of angels are designated to different spheres with different colors used to distinguish the groups. Th e Seraphim have white robes, red and amber wings an d their feet are set in flames. The archangels wear red robes. T he Cherubim support the throne of God. Remarkably, there are day and night angels colored pink and green respect ively. On the apse of San Prassede, the Virgin Mary is sea ted in glory on a throne. To each side of her, are groups of angels with wings, halos on their heads, and folded hands in adoration. Above her head is the symbol, A 12th Century Fresco in the Chiesa di San Pietro a t Civate shows the angelic orders of virtues, princ ipatus and potestates with wings and halos. A 12th Century tympanon on the south portal at Mois sac entitled, \"The Lord in Glory\" shows Christ on a throne surrounded by the twenty-four elders, two angels an d the four beasts of St. John's APOCALYPSE. As the four beasts of Ezekiels vision, the lion, bull, eagle an d man usually are identified with the Cherubim orde r and appear frequently in Medieval Art and sculpture. Likewise, the twenty-four elders of the APOCALYPSE appear th roughout Europe in such places as on the Portico de la Glori a at Santiago, Oloron-Sainte-Marie in Carboeiro, th ree times at the Cathedral at Chartres and at Notre Dame in Pari s. In Northern France alone, there are Romanesque s culptures of the Elders in at least nineteen different churches. Another source of angelology survives in the twenty -seven manuscripts of Beatus, a bishop of Libera, S pain who wrote a commentary on St. John's APOCALYPSE. He inc ludes all symbols of esoteric Christianity particul arly the sacrificial lamb of Christ pierced by the sword in the form of the cross. The four beasts are shown ei ther as the Evangelists or as Cherubim angels with six wings. T he seven spirits are shown as angels with two wings . The twenty-four elders wear crowns and are displayed as kings in adoration. Throughout the manuscripts, th ere appear wheels, probably from Ezekiels's vision, bearing a motif of Ying-Yang symmetry. A very clear example of the angelic orders appears in the Assunta by Masolino. Here, the Virgin Mary i s seated in an oval mandola surrounded by Cherubim and Seraphim . They are shaped like swallows with human heads an d halos. Outside this oval is another layer of angels holding emblems of their particular orders, such a s virtues and shields, orbs, lancers and scepters and a banner in scribed-Virtues. Likewise, the orders are clearly laid out in an ill umination of a 14th Century copy of the Dionysius m anuscript at the Bibliotheque Nationale. St. Denis is shown at his d esk writing his book of commentary entitled DE HIER ARCHIA. Above him in nine arcs are shown the nine Angelic o rders of Dionysius with angels with wings and halos . This particular representation contains the core of Esot eric Christianity replete with figures of the most Holy Trinity above the nine orders.

Typically, th e orders are recognized by a secret script of symbols and colors . For example, in the painting Mary, Queen of Heave n by Frans Hals, we see the Virgin surrounded by various order s of angels, each order being represented by variou s types of musical instruments while still preserving the esot eric characters of the Holy Trinity placed above th e angel groups. This symbolism seen in sculptures, paintings and il luminations throughout the Middle Age has been coll ected by Kathi Meyer-Baer in her book, MUSIC OF THE SPHERES AND THE DANCE OF DEATH (1970). She described the correspondences drawn from the historical comme ntaries as follows: Angels with six wings, the Counsellors: Seraphim Flames Love Cherubim Eyes Knowledge Thrones Wheels Devotion Angels with four wings, the Rulers: Dominations Royal insignia Nobility Virtues Scale Calmness Powers Arms Activity Angels with two wings, the Servants: Principalities Scepter Law Archangels Crozier Work Angels censer Prayer In addition, we also find a variety of shields, orb s, crowns, lances and numerous musical instruments including harps, lutes, flutes, trumpets, fiddles and organs. In the 16th Century, we also see an interesting mus ical score written by Robert Wilkinson entitled Sal ve Regina. It was written in nine parts with each part designated to one of the nine orders of the Celestial Hierarc hy.

THOMAS AQUINAS Prior to St. Thomas Aquinas, the most comprehensive commentary on the CELESTIAL HIERARCHY of Dionysius was by John Erigina Scotus in the Ninth Century. St . Thomas was born near Naples in the ancestral cast le of the Courts of Aquino about year 1224. He studied the Li beral Arts at the University of Naples and at this time met Dominicans who had opened there a school of theolog y. Against the desires of his family, he became a D ominican and travelled to Paris to study theology from Alber t the Great. Still upset, his widowed mother sent t wo of his brothers from the army to capture and hold him host age. After more than a year in captivity, the Domin icans had him set free after pleading with both the Pope and the Emperor. St. Thomas became the prized pupil of Albert, called the Magus, because of his wisdom of the Herm etic sciences as well as being the foremost Western authority of the Hellenistic arts and sciences of Aristotle. In 1256 he received his doctorate in theology and b egan his long career of teaching and writing only a fter receiving a papal dispensation because he was so young. After several years in Paris, he returned to Italy. His fame as a scholar, teacher and writer became so great, he tur ned down offers to became Archbishop and Abbott, so as to continue his vocation. He continued the tradition o f Albert the Great to incorporate the works of Aris totle into theology. To accomplish this, he translated his own texts directly from the Greek because he felt the Arabic versions to be corrupted. His greatest achievement and, of course, the source book of medieval scholasticism was the unfinished SUMMA THEOLOGICA. This text consists of thousands of page s of pinhead dialectic on such subjects as the natu re of God, the Trinity, the Angels, Creation, Man, and Divine Government. While saying Mass on December 6, 1273, he had a revelation, after which he never wrote again. When urged to complete the SUMMA, he is said to have res ponded, \"I can do no more, such things have been revealed to m e that all I have written seems as straw, and I now await the end of my life.\" He died several months later while on journey to a church council at Lyons. In the SUMMA, his discussion of the angelic degrees of hierarchies and orders covers eight points of i nquiry:"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"1. Whether all the angels belong to one hierarchy? 2. Whether in one hierarchy there is only one order ? 3. Whether in one order there are many angels? 4. Whether the distinction of hierarchies and order is natural? 5. Of the names and properties of each order. 6. Of the comparison of the orders to one another. 7. Whether the orders will outlast the Day of Judgm ent? 8. Whether men are taken up into the angelic orders ? Through the hundred of references to the CELESTIAL HIERARCHY, we come to know the contents of this wor k in the same way we learn about the lost writings of Or igen through the commentaries of the Church Fathers . St. Thomas first establishes a distinction between the human and angelic hierarchy. Although all men a re of one species and have one natural mode of understanding, the angels have three distinct and separate hierar chies based upon the more universal knowledge of truth by the s uperior angels. In addition, the diversity of order arises from the diversity of offices and action, which is reduced t o three, namely, the summit, the middle and the bas e. Likewise, within each order, there are angels who are first, middle and last. Next, St. Thomas endeavors to clean up messy termin ology that arises from less than perfect commentari es. The second hierarchy of Dionysius included Dominations, Virtues and Powers. However, Pope Gregory the Grea t (6th Century) says Dominations, Principalities, Powers, then for the third hierarchy, Virtues, Archangels a nd Angels. Both draw upon St. Paul on their authority. In Ephe sians (I. 20-21) he says, \"God has set the man Chri st on his right hand in the heavenly places above all principality and power, and virtue and dominion.\" However, in COLOSSIANS (I. 16) he says, \"Whether Thrones, or Do minations or Principalities, or Powers, all things were created by Him and in Him.\" Apparently, this conflict between Dionysius and Gre gory was important to resolve because it consumes t he largest portion of the text. St. Thomas regards the second hierarchy as a government or administration of exec ution of divine tasks. To the Dominations belong the job of appointing what things are to be done. To the Virtu es belong the jobs of carrying out what is to be done. To the Pow ers belong the orders to be commanded what has been decreed by the higher orders. Citing Dionysius, he says that t he proper name of each order expresses its property . For the first hierarchy, the Cherubim have the excellence of know ledge and the Seraphim the excellence of ardor and charity. Both enjoy having an immediate knowledge of the Div ine will and plan. The Thrones are recognized as ma terial seats, raised above the earth and because of their shape, are open to received the sitter and to serve Him. To the third hierarchy lies the execution of the divine plan. Th e Principalities are the leaders of angelic ministr ations. The angels are the messengers who simply execute what is to be done. Between the two, are the Archangels or angel princes who announce the tasks to the angels but answer to their higher order of Principalities. To each man a guardian angel is assigned for life. Without resolving the issue, St. Thomas suggests th at both orders or Gregory and Dionyius are reasonab le because little or no difference exists in reality between t he orders from mankind's point of view. In an interesting digression St. Thomas addresses t he issue of whether men are taken up with the angel ic orders. He answers that Christ promised (Luke 20) the children of the resurrection will be equal to the number of the angels in heaven. By the gift of grace men can merit glory in such a degree as to be equal to the angels in each of the angelic orders and this implies that men are taken up into the orders of the angels. This concept was further elaborated by Steiner when discussing the Eastern tradition of Buddahood. A D hyani- BuddhA is ensouled by a spirit of the Principalitie s down to his physical body. A Bodhisattva is ensou led by an archangel down to his physical and etheric bodies a nd a human Buddha is ensouled by an angel down to h is physical, etheric and astral bodies. Finally, St. Thomas addresses some issues concernin g the evil angels or demons. He reasoned that since the angels in God's administration existed in certain well def ined orders, so should those spirits who work again st the divine plan. For this he cites the wisdom of St. Paul (Eph esians), \"our wrestling is not against the flesh an d the blood but against Principalities and Powers, against the rule rs of the world of this darkness against the spirit s of wickedness in the high places\". The order of Powers is that of th e Spirits of Form. It was during the Lemurian epoch that Lucifer and his legions invaded the astral body of mankind to work in opposition to the Divine Plan of the spi rits of Form. Similarly, during the Atlantean epoch, the spirits of Ahriman or Satan (as called by the Scholastics) invaded the etheric body of mankind in opposition to the Divine Plan of the Principalities or Archai. Although St. Thomas goes to length in his discussio ns about angels and demons, he ends his treatise on the hierarchies of Dionysius rather abruptly. One would certainly wish his divine inspiration to extend fu rther than his treatise on \"Irascible passions\" or the \" Goodness and Malice of the Interior Act of the Will\". Mankin d had to wait to the revelations of the Michael Age for the next cha pter."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE MARRIAGE IN HEAVEN The marriage of the ancient Chaldean planets to the angelic hierarchy of Dionysuis takes place through the medium of music. In the 6th Century DE NUPTIIS of Martianu s Cappella, we saw the Chaldean planetary spheres m oved by the Muses. In the evolution of angelology through t he Middle Ages, it was only a small leap of faith t o replace the Hellenistic Muses with the Celestial Hierarchy of D ionysius. During this transition, a remarkable woodcut by Fra nchino Gafori (1508) stands out. As shown, there is a correspondence between the Caldean planets on the r ight, the Muses on the left and the tones and inter vals of the Pythagorean musical scale in the middle. At the bot tom is planet Earth represented as the center of th is cosmos, surrounded by the four ancient elements. At the top is Apollo, the sun god, treading on the three head ed serpent. The entire scheme represents the Hellenistic cosmos of Plato and Pythagoras with Christian symbols. The tr ansition from Greek Paganism to Esoteric Christianity is accompli shed with the simple substitutions of Apollo into C hrist, the sun spirit treading the serpent Satan and the Muses int o the angelic hierarchy of Dionyius. Robert FLUDD was born in 1574 and bred a true Eliza bethan, his father having received knighthood. He g raduated from St. John's College, Oxford with a Master's deg ree in 1598. Thereafter, he travelled for six years in Europe supporting himself as a tutor in wealthy families. On his return to England he entered Christ Church, Oxford and graduated in 1605 with a Doctorate of Medicine. How ever, it took him four more years to be accepted in the College of Physicians because of his rejection of tradition al medicine as practiced in Calvinist and Anglican England. As a private physician he followed the practice of Parac elsus and homoeopathy, with a healthy dose of astro logy, magnetic healing and alchemy. For each patient, he calculated their horoscope and determined their cri tical days from planetary transits. Around the year 1614, we see the publication of the three Rosicrucian Manifestoes and although, he alw ays denied being a Rosicrucian, he spent great efforts in publ ishing defenses to the secret society. His many tex tbooks on the ancient wisdom and esoteric Christianity were publi shed in folio format, replete with more diagrams an d illustrations than occultists have seen before or a fter. A true Renaissance man, his goal was none oth er than a complete encyclopedic tabulation of the esoteric sc iences. In his treatise, HISTORY OF THE MACROCOSM, he discu sses and accepts the cosmology of Martianus Capella . With Fludd the marriage of Capella and Dionysius is complete. In dozens of illustrations, he unites th e Chaldean planets and the angelic hierarchy (with the Pope Gr egory reversal) as follows: 1. Moon ------------ Angels 2. Mercury--------- -Archangels 3. Venus------------ Virtues 4. Sun--------------- Principatus 5. Mars -------------- Potestates 6. Jupiter-------------Dominationes 7. Saturn------------- Throni 8. Fixed Stars (Zodiac)----- Cherubim 9. Primum Mobile--------- Seraphim The Holy Trinity Henry Cornelius Agrippa (his portrait) of Neeteshei m revived an ancient wisdom that had been completel y lost from the time of the Magi and King Solomon. In his table s of the planets he assigned to each of the Chaldea n spheres, an intelligence, which by nature is good. He also assi gned to each a spirit, or demon which by nature was evil, to the extent that the demon worked against the plan of th e intelligence. Thus, for each of the angelic hiera rchies associated with a particular planet, there were nam ed presiding spirits. Naming spirits was important for the ancient practice of Geomancy and inscribing talismans. For example, look at the planetary table of MERCURY ."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" First the kamea or magic square has 64 squares, eig ht on each side. The numbers vertically, horizontal ly and diagonally all add up to the number 260 and the sum of all is 2080. The intelligence of the planet is Tiriel and the demon is Taphthartharath. To prepare a talisman for good or evil purposes, a sigil of the spirit is dr awn. First, the name of the saint is reduced by AIQ-BEKER or \"the Q uabbalah of Nine Chambers.\" Thus, for the demon of Mercury, the GEMATRIA (courtesey of Doug Evans, the Hermit) for the seven Hebrew letters is Tau, 400; PeH, 80; Tau 400; Resh 200; Tau 400; Resh 200; and Tau 400. This reduces to 40,8,40,20,40,20, and 40. Second, b eginning with a small circle, a continuous line is traced up on the Kamea to each of the reduced numbers. The re sulting figure shown at the lower right corner, (resembling an ups ide down F) is the sigil symbol to be traced on the talisman for evil purposes. Likewise, the seal of the planet is a symmetrical d esign arranged that its lines pass through every nu mber on the Kamea, thus, becoming a sort of synthesis of the ma gic square. The obvious purpose of such signs, seals, and sigil s was for invoking spirits, both of a good and evil nature. Agrippa doubtless drew upon the Lemegeton or Lesser Key of Solomon and the Book of Enoch Angelic tables for hi s sources. Later ceremonial magicians such as Dr. Rud d, Dr. John Dee, Sir Edward Kelly and Casaubon drew upon Agrippa's text, De Occulta Philosophia(1651) and Ro sicrucian centers existent in Central Europe. By th e late 19th"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Century these planetary tables were again lost, unt il McGregor Mathers translated the Key of Solomonan d revived \"the Treatises of Dr. Rudd\" from manuscripts in the British Museum to be used for ceremonial rituals i n the Golden Dawn. Even Steiner in The Apocalypse of St. John (1 908) performs the gematria of the evil spirit of th e sun- SORATH as Tau 400; Resh 200; Van 6 and Samech 60 fo r a total of 666, the number of the beast! He also draws the sigil for the sun demon as \"a thick stoke bent back upon itself and terminating in two curved points\". The important theme here is not the invoking ritual s of ceremonial magicians but the recognition by me dieval occultists of the practice of the ancient wisdom of naming planets and stars for the spirits (whether good or evil) who rule and preside over them. Central to the ange lology of Agrippa naming the intelligence and demon of each Chaldean planet was the esoteric understanding that mankind was the intelligence spirit of planet Eart h. Occultists like Agrippa knew that mankind received a task from the Elohim to evolve into a ruling planetary spiri t, both as a mover of the planet around the sun and as bearer of creative forces in earth kingdoms of mineral, plan t and animal. By assigning the planetary intelligence of earth to mankind, Agrippa placed the earth in the order of the Chaldean planets and mankind in the order of the angelic cre ative hierarchies. THE ROSICRUCIAN ENIGMA During this time we also see the transition from th e earth centered cosmos of Ptolemy to the sun cente red cosmos of Copernicas. The transition was however, a spiritual one, for the earth centered scheme was a spiritual representation of ruling orders of the angelic hierarchy. The anci ent wisdom surely knew the astronomical fact that t he sun was the center of our planetary system. Exoteric sources in clude Aristarchus(260 B.C.) who laid the foundation for the remarkable achievements of Archimedes and Hipparchu s. The Ptolemaic scheme was an effort by Esoteric Christianity to preserve a spiritual fact that eart h and mankind were the center of the Celestial Hier archy. In all of the ancient religions, one never sees the planet earth represented as one of the seven Chald ean planets. Likewise, when spiritual beings and intelligences a re assigned to the various ancient planets, as we s aw supra with Origen and Agrippa, no spirit is assigned to the Ea rth. This was because esoterically, mankind itself was considered the bearer of the intelligence of this planet. Looking at the Celestial Hierarchy of Dionysius, we see the first hierarchy with three orders of spiri ts, the second hierarchy with three orders of spirits and also the third hierarchy with three orders of spirits. If o ne wished to place mankind in the Celestial hierarchy, he would be the Fourth Hierarchy, with a potential three orders or graduations of humans. Mankind as a creative Fourth Hierarchy was certainl y the intention and grand plan of the Elohim or sun spirits of Form. However, after the fall, mankind united himse lf too strongly with the earth and lost his relatio nship with the creative sun spirits. Instead of being the lowest r ung on the chain of the creative angelic hierarchie s, mankind was in place and stead the highest of the kingdoms of natu re. The earth gave forth the mineral, plant, animal and human kingdoms. This was the major theological problem addressed by the Scholastics of the Middle Ages and the Rosicru cians, as represented by Flood, in the 16th and 17 Centuries. It was also the crux of the spiritual problem betw een the Copernican and Ptolemaic universes. In the course o f evolution of our solar system, the earth separate d out of the mass of the sun as a separate and distinct planet. Christ, as leader of the Spirits of Form (Powers) r emained behind on the sun to guide the evolution of the earth, fro m outside the earth through His agency of the Elohi m Spirits of Form. Because of the Fall, mankind had to be redeem ed by Christ, a spirit from the sun. In this way, t he evolution of the earth united with the evolution of the sun. At his death on the cross, Christ became united with t he earth and as such became the planetary spirit of the earth. Befo re the fall, it was the plan of the Elohim, that ma nkind become the planetary spirit of the earth. Thus, mankind's task to become the Fourth Creative Hierarchy had to be abandoned as Christ took over this mission to fulfill the allott ed task of the earth as it raised its kingdoms of n ature. In a very real sense, the Ptolemaic system with the earth as the center of the planetary system and ma nkind as the Fourth Hierarchy was the ordained plan of the Elohi m. However, when Christ descended through the spher es, incarnated on earth and died on the cross to redeem our sins, mankind's relationship to the planetary system significantly changed. This \"cosmic mistake\" brough t about by the fall and human sin is represented in the Copernican system with the sun as the center and pr ime mover of the planetary affairs. The realization of this cosmic change of plan of the Elohim was the heart a nd soul of the medieval Christian and profoundly ef fected the thinking of Esoteric Christianity. Nicolaus Koppernigk was born in the year 1473. Dr. Steiner (as well as the Good Madame Blavatsky) says that the astral body of former Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa (14 01-1464) ( a page from his book) was woven into the astral body of Copernicus, thereby preserving his scientif ic wisdom. A certain spiritual thread is visible in these two personalities preparing the world for the dawn of s cientific materialism. Nicholas of Cusa was a precu rsor of Copernicus in that his observations in astronomy le d him to believe that the earth was a moving body a nd not the fixed center of the cosmos according to the Ptolema ic view. In addition, this scientific Nicholas was very learned in"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"the orders of the celestial hierarchies through the writings of John Scotus Erigena. Therefore, this u ltimate break with the old world view of Ptolemy was accomplished not with a Charles Darwin type personality but wit h two church fathers fully familiar with the spiritual co nsequences of the doctrines as taught by Dionysius. When Copernicus died in 1543, the medieval world wa s not yet ready for his heliocentic theory. His tex t was given over to Giese, protestant bishop of Kulm, then to f ellow professor Joachim Rheticus and finally to a L utheran theologian named Andreas Osiander. When finally pub lished as DE REVOLUTIONIBUS ORBIUM COELETIUM, Osiander added a preface that said, \"these hypothes es are not necessarily true or even probable\". His work was firmly rejected by Tycho Brahe, the greatest observ ational astronomer in modern times. On his deathbed , Tycho passed his volumes of planetary tables to Johann Ke pler (b. 1571) with a solemn promise that Kepler no t abandon the theory that the sun moves around the earth and that all the other planets move around the sun. Fin ally, when Kepler published his three laws of planetary motion , the scientific revolution from Ptolemy to Coperni cus was completed, both spiritually and physically. We have then, beginning the 17th Century a complete separation of the physical and spiritual worlds, s imilar to the separation of earth-moon from the sun and the later separation of moon from the earth. The Ptolemaic s ystem is an accurate picture of the realms of the rulership of the spiritual hierarchies with the earth at the cen ter. The Copernican system is an accurate picture of the physical plane ts and their motions in space and time, with the su n as center. Because of this historical fact, it is true that si nce the 17th Century, mankind has ceased to be cons cious of the spiritual world and modern science is divorced from religion. Kepler can be said to be the last deeply religious, occult and mystical scientist. To this fundamental realization of man's cosmic mistake and the scienti fic revolution of the Copernicus system, no one really understands , nor is there a solution. This script has been written in the Astral Light, t he Akasha, for all the angelic hierarchies to read and ponder. Now THEY know that we as mankind know our relationship to the spiritual worlds has forever changed. Mankin d is truly alone until the earth re-unites with the sun in som e distant manvantara .

(Angel Magic, From the Ms Harley 6482 British Museu m Library) A LAST WORD Sister Anne Catherine Emmerich says of St. Dionysiu s in her vision of the saint: \"I saw this saint in his boyhood. He was the child of pagan parents and of an inquiring mind. He alway s recommended himself to the Supreme God who enlighte ned him by visions in his sleep. I saw his parents reproving"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"him for his neglect of the gods and placing him und er the charge of a stern preceptor; but an appariti on came to him by night and bade him flee whilst his preceptor sle pt. He obeyed, and I saw him transversing Palestine and listening eagerly to whatever he could hear concerning Jesus. Again I saw him in Egypt where he studied astronom y in the place in which the Holy family had sojourned. Here I saw him, standing with several others before the school, observing the sun's eclipse at the death of Jesus. He said: \"This is not in accordance with nature's l aws. Either a god is dying, or the world is coming to an end!\" I saw the precepter himself, a man of upright intentions, warned to seek his scholar. He did so, found him, and went with hi m to Heliopolis. It was long before Dionysius could reconcile himself to the idea of a crucified God. After his c onversion, he often travelled with Paul (as confirm ed by the spiritual vision of Dr. Steiner). He journeyed wiht him to Ephesus to see Mary. Pope Clement sent him to Paris where I saw his martydom. He took his head in his h ands, crossed them on his breast,, and walked aroun d the mountain, a great light shining forth from him. The executioners fled at the sight, and a woman gave h im sepulture. He was then very old. He had had many celestial vis ions besides which, Paul had revealed to him what h e himself had seen. he wrote magnificent works of which many are still extant. His book on the Sacraments was no t finished by himself, but by another.\" At his beheading on Montmarte, his blood was collec ted on a cloth called the Oriflamme, which lated be came the gold flame on the French flag. St. Joan of Acr carr ied the cloth into battle and there is a window in the cathedral showing St. Denys giving the Oriflamme to a Knight Templar. SEPTENARY IN HUMAN AND ANGELIC EVOLUTION 1. The Pitris The good Madame H.P.B. in the Secret Doctrine state s that there are seven classes of Angels or Pitris, three incorporeal and four corporeal and two kinds, Agnis hvattas and the Barhishads. All Pitris are called t he progenitors or fathers of mankind and it is the difference betw een these two classes and the evolutionary lines th at proceed from them that we will discuss here. The Barhishads are commonly referred to as Lunar Pi tris, and are possessed of the creative fire. They are responsible for physical evolution, round which nat ure has created the present physical form. They are the four classes of corporal bodies, the lower quaternary de void of intellect, the hosts of the four material c lasses who originally created men simultaneously in the seven zones on earth. As the Madame explains in Eastern occultism, \"It is, then, the moon that plays the largest and m ost important part, as well in the formation of the earth itself, as in the peopling thereof with human beings. The Lunar M onads or Pitris, the ancestors of man, became in re ality man himself. They are the monads who enter on the cycle of evolution of Globe A, and who, in passing round the chain of planets, evolve the human form...at the beginnin g of the human stage of the Fourth Round on this gl obe, they ooze out their astral doubles from the ape like for ms which had evolved in Round III. It is this subtl e, finer form, which serves as the model round which nature builds physical man. These monads or divine sparks are th us the Lunar ancestors, the Pitris themselves. For these L unar spirits have to become men in order that their monads may reach a higher plane of activity and self-conscious ness, ie., the plane of the Manasaputras, those who endow the senseless shells, created and informed by the Pitri s with 'mind' in the latter part of the Third Root Race.\" The other division of Pitris, the Agnishvattas, are commonly referred to as the Solar Pitris. They are possessed of the intellectual fire (agni) and are responsible for th e implanting of the fifth principle (manas) in man as opposed to the lower quaternary (physical, etheric, astral, lower ego) in man created by the Lunar Pitris. In the sen se that the heart is the center of the human body, these solar angels or fire Dhyanis are considered as the heart of the Dhyani- Chohanic body of celestial angels, as the sun is th e heart of the solar system. Their role in the evolution of humanity is understo od only in connection with the Lunar Pitris. The hu man Pitris evolved the lower quaternary of man during the firs t three globes or kingdoms of the Fourth Round. Dur ing the evolution of the fourth kingdom, after the passing from an arupa to a rupa condition, the earth and it s life forms become physical. The human evolved an animal form, but it was mindless, only a shell. The Lunar Pitris did not have the karmic background to endow the human form with a mind. Thus, the animal form of man evolved d uring the Polarean and Hyperborean root races only to fin d at the beginning of the third root race, a mindle ss creature incapable of further intellectual evolution. Becaus e the solar Pitris and the lunar Pitris had evolved separately, the humankind of the Lemurian root race possessed only the lower quaternary, devoid of the fifth principle . Refused to Create The occult reason the Solar and Lunar Pitris evolve d separately is because the solar Pitris \"refused t o create\". Had they created along with the Lunar Pitris, then mank ind would have evolved with all five principles tog ether. There are several levels of explanation as to why the Agn ishvattas held back and did not incarnate in man un til the Third root races."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"One reason is given by L. Gorden Plummer presumably derived from lectures of the Theosophical Society. At the end of each round including the last lunar round, a ll life forms go into a long pralaya or Nirvanic re st. There are many levels of Nirvana, with each spiritual entity going to that level corresponding to its attained s tate of consciousness. Thus, lower evolved entities go to a lower level than more highly evolved ones. Higher evolved entities go to a higher level of bliss and for a lo nger duration. At the end of the third round, the Pitris were evol ved animal monads destined to become human in the F ourth Round. As said before, there are seven classes of P itris, and the Agrishnatti Pitris were of the highe r three classes, being more advanced. Therefore, they stayed longer in their nirvanic pralaya and emerged later than di d the less evolved human Lunar Pitris. This concept is similar to what the good Madame H.P .B. states from a source in the Hindu Puranas, that since the Solar Pitris were of the three higher classes, they were incorporate or arupa, being more spiritual an d intellectual. Because they were arupa, they had no astral body to sacrifice to the evolving humanity below. Their re fusal to create was not so much as act of rebellion but one of karm ic destiny. In addition, evolution requires a lower class of an gels to create inhabited globes and to deal with th e dense matter on the physical plane. The good Madame further says, \" Where there is no struggle, there is not merit. Hum anity was not destined to be created by the first divine brea th; therefore they are said to have to refuse to (c reate) and man to be formed by more material creators, who, in their turn, could give only what they had in their own na tures, and no more. Perfection, to be fully such, must be born ou t of imperfection.\" Descent of the Manasaputras In the Apocalypse of St. John, we read about the gr eat war in heaven, where Michael and his angels fou ght against the dragon. The great dragon was defeated and cast out and his tail drew \"the third part\" of the stars in heaven and did cast them to the earth. This third part of the stars in heaven corresponds to the three classes of Arupa Solar Pitris, the ones endowed with Manas or intelligence. Up to the beginning of the Third Root Race, the Lunar Pit ris had evolved the lower quaternary but without mind or in telligence, the fifth principle called manas. Easte rn occultism calls these Solar Pitris the \"mind-born sons\" or Ma nasaputras and the descent of the Manasuptras (the Prometheus legend in Greek) refers to their incarnation in the Lemurian Third root race as kings, Rishis, heroes and leaders of nations and migrations. Since there are three classes of Solar Pitris, ther e will be three classes of mind-born sons when they incarnate in the third-root race. Some of these were Nirmanakayas fr om previous Rounds or Manvantaras and these of cour se came first and filled the minds of the elect of mankind as Rishis, kings and leaders of nations. Speech did not exist then nor did it have to since mankind recognized their s uperior qualities and followed them. The second cla ss of Agnishuatta Pitris were far more numerous and incar nated in the vast majority of mankind who were \"hal f ready\" and received but a spark of manas. This average hum anity of which we are a part needs only to proporti onately develop manas during this Round and not to perfect it as in the case of the pre-maturely developed int ellects of the first class whom we call \"fifth-rounders\". The third class of Solar Pitris relates to the lagg ards at the close of the Lunar or third manvantara who were not ready to receive the spark of manas. These were the least evolved animals monads on the Lunar chain an d had to evolve further at the beginning of this round to ma mmals. The animal has an astral body which survives for a short time after death, but it does not go to Devachan bu t instead spends a short time in the species group soul. The animal monad incarnates in a higher species and this incar nation must occur before the middle of the Fourth R oot Race when the door shuts closed on further upward transm igration. Thus, certain animal monads evolving duri ng this round and certain laggard Lunar Pitris can evolve i nto human monads but being the latest arrivals thei r intelligence is lowest in the chain. These late human monads can only incarnate in bodies of the savage, which has only a dim spark of manas. However, they still have the evolut ionary possibility to reach the level of the second or average class of Solar Pitris at the end of this round, so as to incarnate as Sons of Wisdom at the beginning of the fifth Round. Gorilla Man Western esoterism describes the evolution of the So lar and Lunar Pitris a little differently, R. Stein er in his Foundations of Esotericism describes what exists as a Jehovah principle and a Lucifer principle. \"Half way through the Lemurian Race kama-manas appeared on the physic al plane in the duality of the sexes. The God who b rought about kama-manas was Jehovah. This is why H.P. Blav atsky called him the moon God; he is rightly called the God of Fertility. The sexuality which made its appearan ce in the Lemurian age, when we trace it backwards, in its higher, nature becomes the Second Logos.\" With the separation of the Sun and Old Moon during the third manvantara, the Old Moon retained the pow er of reproduction represented in the kama principle of s eptenary man. Later, during the separation of the m oon from the earth in the Fourth Round, the leader of the Pitris who remained on the moon was the Jehovah God, of H ebraic"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"tradition and also one of the seven Elohim of Genes is. The fifth principle, intelligence or manas, did not interest him. His intention was the perfection of form, the creation of beautifully formed human beings. Howeve r, this principle if exhausted to its limit would have prod uced beautiful but rigid, frozen forms and in addit ion, would also have expended the power of reproduction. As a testament to the Jehovah principle, a classic example is visible today in the silver backed goril la. This magnificent beast is tall, strong, healthy, handsom e, intelligent and monument to the evolution of the JHVH principle of form. However, every naturalist who ha s studied and observed the species says that it is doomed to extinction because the species has a rapidly declin ing rate of reproduction. The female is still sexua lly receptive, but the male, the classic symbol of the species virilit y only has an erection about five or six days a yea r. This degeneration of the sexual impulse, the victory of form over function, is exactly what occultists pred icted about the Jehovah principle of reproduction expending itself into extinction. The condor of the Andes Mountains in Chile is another example of the evolution of a magnificent f lying form threatened to extinction because the fem ale only produces a single egg every eighteen months. On the other hand, there is a line of evolution whe re form is perfected but not at the cost of loss of sexual virility. In the insect world we see how ants and bees have virt ually eliminated sexual reproduction from their soc ial and individual lives. What is sexual and necessary for the reproduction of the species is vested in only o ne queen. Here lies great wisdom for the future of mankind where s ex is replaced by work as the fabric of social stru cture! Genius Another approach to understanding the Luciferic spi rits is in relation to micro-cosmic evolution of th e seven principles. The seven principles in Eastern occulti sm (Sanskrit) next to their Western counterparts ar e and the macro-cosmic elements are: MICRO-COSMIC PRINCIPLES ELEMENTS MANVANTARA 1. Sthula-Sarira Physical body Earth Old Saturn 2. Linga-Sariri Etheric body Water Old Sun 3. Kama-Rupa Astral body Air Old Moon 4. Kama-Manas Lower/Higher Ego fire Earth 5. Manas Spirit-self Akasha Jupiter 6. Buddhi Life-spirit Spirit Venus 7. Atma Spirit-man Divine Vulcan During each of the seven planetary evolutions or ma nvantaras a Macro-cosmic element is evolved, which corresponds in man to the septenary micro-cosmic pr inciples. Thus, during the Old Saturn Manvantara, t he seed for the physical body was laid down by the Thrones and the Archai or Spirits of the Age achieved their hum an or fourth principle. During the Old Sun Manvantara, the seed for the etheric body was laid down by the Dominatio ns or Spirits of Wisdom and the Archangels achieved their fourth principle. During the Old Moon Manvantara, the Mights or spirits of Motion laid down the seed for the ast ral body and the Angels achieved their fourth princ iple. In each case, the corresponding Archai, Archangel and Angel achieves its fourth principle by actually inhabiti ng the human physical body (so far as it had evolved) on the ear th. This evolutionary progression continues so that dur ing this fourth Manvantara, we collectively as mank ind are to achieve the fourth principle and incorporate it int o our physical body. This is the whole mission of t his Earth evolution. At the end of this fourth planetary evol ution, the lower quaternary of physical, etheric, a stral and ego should be completely evolved in the general mass of humanity. Simultaneously with the evolution of the fourth pri nciple or ego during this Manvantara, mankind is gi ven a glimpse or taste of his three higher principles of Manas, B uddhi and Atma. This was not the Divine plan of the Spirits of Form, but occured as a result of the Luciferic spir its invading the human astral body after the middle of the Lemurian age. The higher triad is not scheduled to be evolved to the degree the ego evolves during thi s Round, as this will occur during the following Manvantaras. T hus, the plan of the Spirits of Form is during the next Jupiter evolution, the fifth principle or manas will be inc orporated into the physical body to the extent that the ego will be during this stage. Likewise, during the Venus evolu tion, the sixth principle or Buddhi will be incorpo rated into the physical body and so, with the seventh principle du ring the Vulcan evolution. In all, during this fourth planetary evolution, we as mankind only so to speak look up to the higher t riad but do not embody it into our physical body. Thus, the general mass of humanity receives a spark of manas during the fifth root race, a spark of Buddhi during the sixth root race and a spark of Atma during the seventh root race. M anas will develop on the physical plane into a kind of harden ed egoism, during the sixth cultural epoch, which n eeds to be overcome with altruism, during the seventh cultural epoch, but these sparks never reach the level of e mbodiment for the whole of humanity."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The Pitris during the third or Old Moon planetary e volution experienced the corresponding evolution of the seven principles as we do now during earth evolution. For these who had a normal development or as the good Madame H. P. B. would say, \"those who ran the race successful ly\", would come over to the earth evolution with a normally developed physical, etheric and astral body, into w hich could be incorporated the ego. These normal Lu nar Pitris form the general mass of humanity today. However, some do not run the race successfully. The se who run ahead are the moon adepts and those who fall behind are the Lunar Pitris called Luciferic spirit s. Not every angel who fully developed its fourth p rinciple during the Old Moon evolution, also fully developed the sp ark of the higher triad it received as we humans re ceive the spark during this earth evolution. Some angels may have only developed through the fifth principle, ot hers through the sixth principle. They should have all developed through seven principles, but some were laggards a nd some the product of normal septenary evolution. At the beginning of the fourth Manvantara, which is to proceed through seven rounds and forty-nine glo bes, R. Steiner says in the Cosmic Ego (1912) that there ar e two classes of Lunar Pitris, \"First, those who ha d developed only their fifth principle and did not develop thei r sixth and seventh principle. (Second) those who h ad developed their sixth principle and but not their seventh\". T o this we can add a third class of normal human mon ads who had developed their three principles on Old Moon and ca me to earth evolution ready to develop their fourth (ego). Of these three classes of beings, only the normally developed human monads could evolve within a human physical body. The two classes of Lunar Pitris did not deser ve nor could they attain nor did the possibility ex ist for embodiment in a human physical body. Thus, in order to continue developing their sixth and seventh pri nciples, these Luciferic spirits penetrated the human astral body as a substitute for the physical body. During the Lemurian and Atlantean Ages, there were some human monads who had prematurely developed the ir fourth principle and these persons were the first t o be possessed by the Luciferic spirits. As discuss ed before, these persons became the leaders of humanity, of nations and migrations, kings, heroes and prophets. It is o bvious that the great leaders of humanity were not normally develop ed persons. The great secret of cultural evolution lies in the fact that the intellectual (Manas) development of scienc e, philosophy and mathematics and the Buddhi develo pment of art, music and literature are directed by Luciferic spirits evolving in the astral bodies of normally developing mankind. The traditional role given Lucifer and his legions by the Western Christian exoteric church i s that of the evil devil leading his spirits from hell to cause s in, disease and death. Obviously, this designation is misplaced when even the Western name for Lucifer means Light-beare r! As human evolution has proceeded through the Atlant ean Age and through four cultural epochs in the Ary an Root Race, so have the Luciferic spirits evolved their f ifth and sixth and seventh principles. Now what we call a genius is a person who is possessed by a Luciferic spirit evo lving his seventh principle. Sometimes, this may la st only a few years, enough time to enter and leave the physical plane, but the results of genius leave an everlasti ng impact on our cultural traditions. And, for those Luciferic spiri ts who successfully develop their higher principles , they are redeemed thru mankind and allowed to pass on and co mplete their normal evolution in future Manvantaras . Such is a cosmic task of human evolution in developing the angelic hierarchies. Orpheus Descending During my lifetime, the musical world of rock and r oll serves as the great play ground of the Luciferi c spirits. Take a familar example of Jim Morrison of the DOORS. At th e age of 20, he was a college film student going no where. Suddenly, his ego was taken over by a Luciferic spi rit and overnight a star was born. His music was ve ry original and poetic, but with a dark underside of cruelty, p arental anger, fear and death. His many monologues also spoke of that Luciferic symbol of antiquity, the serpent, wh ich he called the MO-JO RISING. On the one hand, hi s many LSD trips put him in a place where his Luciferic sp irit guided him creatively, but on the other hand, under the later influence of a witch, he attracted many dark demons from the astral world which carried with them very negative and self-destructive impulses. He was not at the peak of his career when he commit ted suicide in Paris. My observation of this Lucife ric phenomenon in rock and roll, is that at the upper f lat length of the bell curve, the guiding spirit de parts. If the creative artist has no \"spiritual center\" to hold h is seven princilples together, unvariably, manic de pression and suicide results. In Jim's case, in Paris he realise d that his Luciferic spirit had left him high and d ry and without prolonging the agony of despair, he killed himself. This course of events does not happen in all cases. For example, another singer, songwriter and politi cal activist, Phil Ochs, rode the Luciferic comet to the top. He was compared to Bob Dylan. His bell curve flattened out around 1970 when he cut his final album. Unlike Jim Morris on, Phil struggled with what his biographers call \"disillusionment, poor career choices and depressio n\" over the next six years, until his suicide in 19 76. We actually observe three types of rock and roll st ars, which by definition are drug dependant, posses sed by Luciferic spirits. In the Morrison case, the astral demons wasted no time in leading the soul to suici de. The same can"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"be said about Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Coba in and Sid Vicious. In the second case of Phil Ochs , after he realised that his muse had left, he struggled and t ried to pull his life together, but over time and h aving no spiritual center, he also surrendered to suicide. The third type can be seen in a star like Paul McCa rtney formerly of the Beatles fame. Without questio n, when the Beatles split apart, the spirit departed in a hurry . But, McCartney did not go the path of the first t wo types. The essential difference with the third type is the nou rishment of a \"spiritual center.\" One can never giv e himself up wholly to his Luciferic spirit without maintaining an ego centered around a higher spiritual value. I do not personally know what held McCartney together, but it may be as simple as love, marriage and family, a spiritual v alue not common to rock stars. With Bob Dylan, it was religi on and family. New Age critics scoff at stars who \" get religion\", but it is precisely having this spiritual center to fall back on that pulls artists thru when the spir it departs. Granted, getting religion takes many weird forms, such as, J esus freaks, vegetarians, cultism and spiritualism, and this represents a low level insecure response to the los s, but they hold together and do not commit suicide . Do not think for a minute that the Luciferic spirit enjoys leaving his host high and dry. The successf ul creative artist, such as Paul Simon, keeps his spirit over time by n ourishing a spiritual center without being dragged down by the astral demons. No star has been thru more and lived to see the sunrise than Elton John, but, somehow h e has kept his spirit, thru the rise and fall of astral demons. The lesson here is simple. The Luciferic spirits ne ed a warm body to develop their principles and we c an ride the comet to fame and fortune, or we can consciously de velop-in unity with the spirit-our higher principle s around a Buddhic Center (6th principle), our higher ego, and enjoy the ride without a fall. Soul Food The Knights Templar take their name from the Temple of Solomon given to them by King Baldwin II after the victorious First Crusade. In Arabic, this temple is called Al-Aqsa and was built by Abd-Al-Malik at th e site of the Temple Mount built by King Solomon. The Koran tells the tale of the night Muhammad the prophet was awa kened by the Archangel Gabriel. He was led to the Kabba ( built by Abraham) and there he mounted a beautiful snow white winged beast which flew him to the Temple Mount and former site of Razed Temple of Solomon in Jerusale m. Inside the Temple he had discourse with all the pro phets who proceeded him, including Abraham, Moses a nd Jesus. Mohammad was asked by the prophets to choose a drin k for refreshment, either milk or wine. He chose th e milk and Gabriel said that this was a wise choice for him an d his generations. Henceforth, the consumption of w ine and other alcoholic spirits was banned from Arabic society. This story has great symbolism relating to our Sola r and Lunar Pitris. The food of the Lunar Pitris li ne of evolution is represented by everything relating to milk. This first form of human food dates from the pre-Lemuri an Age of mammals feeding their young with their own milk. Oc cultists call milk, moon-food, and persons who nour ish themselves on milk are called Sons of the Moon. Mil k contains the Jahve forces of the moon. Scientists have long recognized the difference in r aces and nations that can and cannot dissolve the m ilk sugar lactose in their stomachs. For example, an Irishman can drink a 16 oz. glass of milk and the same drin k would give an Italian a belly-ache. Biologist Jared Diamond of UCLA recently divided all human nations into two g roups, the \"lactase race\" and the \"lactase-deprived race\" sayi ng that there is an actual gene for this enzyme whi ch dissolves lactose. Other scientists say that everyone is born with this enzyme but that it stops producing itsel f in the stomach after infancy, in certain cultures, particularly th e Mediterranean. Thus, there is an actual genetic b asis for moon-food that has biologically evolved since Lemurian times and which now seems to be phasing itself out of rac ial evolution. The food of the Solar Pitris line of evolution is r epresented by everything relating to the upper part of the plant. The leaves, blossoms and fruit of the plant grow, live and die while bathed in the light giving forces of the sun. The plant proteins of nuts and fruit feed the lower body of m an while the stem and leaves feed the middle body t o nourish the heart and lungs. Occultists call all that portion o f the plant that grows above the ground, sun-food a nd the farming and gathering peoples, Sons of the Sun. This was th e second form of human food. The difference between sun food and moon food is pr eserved in the Bible story of Cain and Abel. Cain w as a farmer of the soil and represented the Sons of the Sun. Ab el was a shepherd and represented the Sons of the M oon. The Jehovah forces of the moon worked their way into th e forces of animal nature in the flocks of beasts w ho nourished their young with milk. Steiner says that, \"It was a falling away from Jehovah when man went over to th e sun-food. This is why Jehovah would not accept Cain's offerin g, because it was the offering of sun-food.\" Thus, the burnt offerings of pre-Christian animal sacrifice were in tended for our moon Elohim, as an appeasement for t he farming and gathering tribes of the rising Atlantean root-r ace. A third type of human food was added during the evo lution of the Fifth Root Race, when man added to hi s diet what he took out of the earth in the form of minerals. T his includes the root part of the plant consisting of mineral salts that lies beneath the soil, out of the reach of the sun's rays. This also includes such plant tubers a s the potato and the turnip. In addition, the mineral form includes all food forms prepared through a chemical process, suc h as applied to"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"plants and proteins and fruits. The representative of chemically prepared food products is wine becaus e the grapes are sun-food worked over chemically by man and not by nature. Thus, there is an evolution through the food groups of milk, plant proteins and wine corresponding to the Lemurian, Atlantean and post-Atlantean Ages, corresponding to hunting, gathering and farming and lastly, mining peoples. There is also a similar correspondence among the in itiates of the various mystery centers. As can be s een from our Koran story of Muhammed the Prophet, the initiates of the Hindu, Persian and Egyptian epochs rejected the use of ceremonial wine. These three cultural epochs were r epetitions of earlier cultural evolutions. With the beginning of the fourth cultural epoch in the Greek-Roman sub-ra ce, we see for the first time an actual mystery cul t celebrate wine was part of the initiation ceremonies. The Gre ek Dionysius was a wine God! This celebration of wi ne transferred over into the Christian culture when Ch rist turned water into wine at the marriage at Cana . Christ also inaugurated the celebration of wine at the Last Sup per as a repetition of the giving of bread and wine by Melchizedek to Abraham, as he arrived in Jerusalem from Ur. Christ is the Son of Man in the sense that the Solar Pitris are the Sons of the Sun and the Lunar Pitris are the Sons of the Moon. Likewise, the Christian clergy are the Sons of Man since they daily celebrate the taking w ine with each Mass. Why is the Christian clergy instructed to drink win e at every Mass? It is because wine and all alcohol consumption represents a loss of memory. With the Atlantean ata vistic clairvoyance, the etheric body had unlimited ancestral memory. The Christ event in the fourth cultural epo ch represented the macro-cosmic ego of fourth princ iple being given to humanity for development throughout the re mainder of earth evolution in this Manvantara. In o rder to fully develop the ego, it was absolutely necessary to sup press the memory and teaching of incarnation and Ka rma. For this reason, the Judeo-Christian tradition teaches the significance of this earth life and Karma has b een turned into the doctrine of pre-destination (from St. Augustine to John Calvin). The difference in ego development between Western culture with its wine food and Eastern cult ure with its teaching of incarnation and karma is c learly evident. Since the Archangel Michael event in 1879, the teac hing of incarnation and karma is ripe for the Chris tian culture. Hopefully, we shall see the clergy stop celebrating wine at Mass and also see a miracle of turning win e back into water. 2. DIVISION OF THE RACES JHVH INFLUENCE As stated before, the Mission of earth evolution is the development of the Fourth principle or the ego , the human I. At the stage of the Third Root Race or Lemurian Age , man consisted of what was carried over from the t hree previous Manvantaras: the physical body from the Ol d Saturn age, the etheric body from the Old Sun age and the astral body from the Old Moon age. However, at this time, the ego had not yet descended into the human sheath, nor was there incarnation of souls because mankind was under the guidance of a common group soul, located on the Astral plane. In addition, the earth-moon planet wa s separated out from the ancient sun but was united as a single planetary body. Had the earth remained united with the moon, the ph ysical bodies of animal evolution would have become hard and calcified, leading to an evolutionary dead-end. Rec ognizing this problem, the Spirits of Form with hel p from the other Hierarchies, separated out the moon and with it all the dense, heavy matter that would have grou nded humankind. In this sense, the moon is thought of as a corpse of the earth planet. The Elohim Jahve wen t with the moon and with him the forces of reproduction. Thus, during the Lemurian Age, the separation of the sex es occurred, the first \"fall\" of mankind into generation. Sexual reproduction wrecked havoc upon the evolutio n of the human animal. Interbreeding among species of animals occurred resulting in all sorts of grotesqu e by-products. The beautiful astral bodies of the A pollo men sacraficed by the Solar Pitris during the Hyperbore an Age were later degenerated into physical human b odies incapable of developing the ego principle. This was the darkest period of humanity and human evolution as we know it almost came to an end. Two things needed to happen to save the human race. First, the principle of species heredity needed to be established. Probably the greatest achievement of J ahve was to evolve the biological mechanism of here dity to prevent species from inbreeding. Second, a spiritual pralaya was needed to protect i ncarnating animal monads from entering these grotes que bodies resulting from the orgy of sexual reproduction. The Hindus still worship the monkey as a reminder of t he sins of our fathers. Prior to the actual extrusion of the moon from the earth-moon mass, the life wave of incarnat ing human monads was descending upon the earth to begin their ascent through evolution. Certain souls also havin g incarnated several times an earth remained in the spiritual wo rld of the earth's aura, and \"refused to create\" or descend again into these unsuitable Lemurian bodies. Certain othe r incarnating souls wanted to descend but found the Lemurian bodies too hardened and ossified."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"As Steiner says, \"only the very strongest souls wer e able to master the hardened matter sufficiently t o incarnate on the earth; the others were obligated to withdraw ag ain into the spiritual world\". Thus, a sort of spir itual pralaya occurred as described in Occult History, and of cou rse this resulted in a serious de-population of the human species on the planet. Where did this life-wave of incarnating animal mona ds and previously incarnated human monads go? Stein er says that they were transported to other five planets th at had formed out of the planetary substance, some to Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury. This was not a ne w concept, going back to Plato's Timaeus of Locri w ho says \"She (nature) then took up the task of working out mortal and ephemeral living beings, whose souls wer e drawn in from different sources, some from the moon, others from the sun, and others from the various planets.\" A significant result of this sojourn to the various planets was t hat these souls could not come under the direct inf luence of the Spirits of Form residing in the sun and whose task it was to guide the racial evolution of humanity. Earth Rotation During this spiritual pralaya, the sun, earth and m oon forces evolved into their astronomical relation ship we now see. For example, when the Old Moon planet separate d from the Old Sun during the third manvantara, alt hough it followed an elliptical orbit around the Old Sun, th e planet itself did not rotate in place. (For a pla net to rotate on its axis, a Spirit of Motion is necessary to reside the rein). It always kept its same side facing the Old Sun as the moon now does in respect to its orbit around the earth. Thus, during the Old Moon age, the activity of the Spirits of Form residing in the Old Sun was continuous, without alt ernating day and night. During the Hyperborean Age, prior to the extrusion of the moon, our planet earth also orbited around o ur sun in a similar manner, keeping one side always facing the sun. However, after the extrusion of the moon durin g the Lemurian Age, the earth began to rotate in place ca using day and night and the corresponding alternati ng activity of the Spirits of Form. This physical event was very i mportant for the salvation of humankind after the s eparation of the sexes. As said before, the greatest event of the Jahve Elo him was the evolution of the principle of species h eredity. This event saved the human race as a populating species. However, it also grounded the evolving ego princip le entirely in the earth aura. With the heredity principle, each a nimal species developed a group soul which was enti rely bound to earth evolution. Early man evolving during the Lemu rian Age also had a group soul. It was not until th e end of the Atlantean Age that most individual souls had fully detached themselves from the group species soul. Th e animals of Eziekie'ls vision and of the Apocalypse, the bull, lion, eagle and man are ancient symbols of the work of the group soul on the etheric body during the first four sub- races of the Atlantean Age. Thus, the evolution of the ego principle in each in dividual incarnating monad is simultaneously a sepa ration of the individual ego from the unified group soul created in the plan of the Spirits of Form. As a result of the heredity principle, in each earth life the soul felt the exi stence of a group ego all the way back to the earli est ancestor and this ancestral memory was preserved in the etheric body. The down side to the Jahue achievement was that ea ch individual ego was restrained from evolving as an i ndependent soul, being always grounded in earth evo lution. It was necessary to preserve mankind's contact with th e higher spiritual beings who sacrificed their bodi es for them. The physical solution to this problem of ancestral memory restraining the evolving earth ego from its contact with spiritual worlds occurred when the earth planet beg an to rotate on its polar axis. With rotation in pl ace come alternating day and night. During the day, the huma n ego and astral bodies worked into the etheric and physical bodies. At night, this daytime activity ceased, and the ego and astral bodies separated from the physi cal and etheric bodies. In this body-free time during sleep, the eg o and astral bodies communicated with the higher sp iritual beings known as Angels, Archangels, and Archai. In this wa y, the higher spiritual beings could influence the ego and repair the damage to the astral body caused by the day con sciousness Luciferic spirits. Before the physical event of day and night, the inc arnating ego on earth would have had no contact wit h the spiritual hierarchies during life and after death the ego wou ld have returned to the group soul and been later r eborn in another human body, without the spiritual union in a body f ree condition with the spiritual hierarchies. The m ore grounded earth ego can during sleep maintain its contact and retain memories of higher spiritual beings and dur ing each successive incarnation evolve out of the group ego as an individual being. Examples of this accomplish ment are plentiful. For example, the heroes of Greek mytholo gy are actual beings who lived on the astral plane during the Atlantean Age with memory of that being retained by incarnating souls into the Aryan Age. This condition of night time caused by the rotation of the earth allowed the ego and astral body to ha ve spiritual communion with the members of the third Hierarchy o f Angels, Archangels and Archai. Their influence wa s determined for this manvantara by working on mankin d during the night while the ego and astral body we re in a body-free condition during sleep. But what of the i nfluence of the true leaders of earth evolution, th e Spirits of Form from the second Hierarchy ? They work thru the sunl ight during the daytime and at night, their influen ce is stopped by cover of darkness."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"During the Hyperborean Age, when the sun had separa ted out the earth-moon planet, the work of the Spir its of Form was continuous, because there was no night time. Du ring the early Lemurian Age, when the moon separate d out from the earth-moon planet and the earth began to r otate, the activity of the Spirits of Form was not continuous, but interrupted by the night condition. Would mankind e volve in a condition where the activity of the Spir its of Form was only half-fold ? The solution to this problem came when the Spirits of Form sent the JAVHE Elohim to the moon. At the e nd of the Old Moon manvantara, 7 spiritual beings had evolved whom we call the Spirits of Form or Elohim and the y worked from the sun to guide evolution. Other spiritual be ings, who had not achieved their rank in the Hierar chy, needed a place to reside so as to continue their development and for this reason the sun separated out the plan et Mercury for the Archai and the planet Venus for the Archangels. The sphere of the angels became the moon, after it separated out. The activity of the Spirits of Form is embodied in the sunlight and it is in this sunlight that they f ill the planetary cosmos with their mission during each manvantara. D uring the Old Sun manvantara, the mission of the Hi erarchies created a \"cosmos of strength.\" During the Old Moon manvantara, the Hierarchies created a \"cosmos of w isdom.\" The mission of the Elohim during this earth manvant ara is to create a \"cosmos of love.\" As this earth evolution rests upon the foundations of the earlier manvantaras, ou r cosmos of love rests upon the pillars of Strength and Wisdom (represented by the pillars of Jochim and Boaz in t he APOCALYPSE and in the Masonic tradition). The occult laws of three and seven teach that from the unity proceeds, first the three and then the se ven. The ancient mysteries taught that the sun was three-fold, as la st expressed by Emporer Julian the Apostate at the close of the mysteries in the fourth century. The light of this three-fold spiritual sun is sevenfold in its rays o f the spectrum as reflected in the seven Elohim collectively called t he Logos by Gnostic and Hellenistic wisdom. It is i n the rays of sunlight that the Elohim send down the forces of lo ve to embody the mission of this manvantara. With the separation of the moon from the earth, the Spirits of Form sent the JAHVE Elohim to the moon to continue their activity. During the day, the rays of love fr om the remaining six Elohim work on man's whole bod y from outside. But they cannot work directly on the ego a nd astral body because, during the day they are not in a body free condition, being incorporated in the other principl es of man. However, at night during sleep, the JAHV E Elohim works on the ego and astral body in their body free condition thru the reflected light of the three-fo ld spiritual sun. Return to Earth With the reciprocal relations of the sun, earth and moon being established by the Spirits of Motion du ring this spiritual pralaya, the time came when these souls w ho had previously been removed to the planets, retu rned to populate the earth. This was the life wave of incar nating monads commencing during the end of the Lemu rian Age and continuing into the Atlantean or Fourth Root Ra ce. As the souls migrating to each race increased, so did the human population. Racial chacteristics are a direct result the different soul-lives experienced during the sojorn to the various planets. The Lemurian continent arose in the area of the Ind ian Ocean. Australia and New Zealand are remaining portions of it. When this continental plate subducted a portion of the plate containing the nation of India collid ed with the continental shield of Asia causing the Himalayan Mo untains to uplift. Life during this age was difficu lt. The continent was shaped with tremendous volcanic activ ity and at the other extreme with periodic glaciati on. Surviving this great winter of the earth's discontent was one ancestral pair, the Adam and Eve of Genesis. Moder n anthropology recognizes this fact with the theory t hat all humans have the same genetic link back to a n original mother or Eve. This pralaya made it possible for hu man substance to be refined and suitable to receive the weaken souls. Until the middle of the Atlantean Age, the d escendants of Adam and Eve were able to live in a m ore plastic substance then had been available before the extrus ion of the moon. Thus, all the generations of perso ns evolving on earth are the result of propagation with the descen dants of this ancestral pair. That an historical pa ir did survive the entire planetary evolution is now recognized by ant hropologists as the Biblical or Mitochondrrial Eve, which they genetically trace, for now, back 200,000 years to A frica As the Atlantis land mass became isolated from the sea floor spreading of the Mid-Atlantic ridge, a co ntinental island emerged supporting life and as the peopling of the earth increased, two evolutionary lines of s ouls emerged. First, there were those human generations whose sou ls coming from the various planets were from the fi rst time appearing on earth. Second, there were those souls, the direct descendants of Adam and Eve, who had pr eviously incarnated an earth, having never left it during th e pralaya. This would require a racial line of the Adam-Eve descendants who were under the direct influence of the Spirits of Form and a separate racial line unde r the direct influence of the five planetary spirits, the Spirit s of Motion. With the advent of incarnation through both soul lines, there appeared for the first time, individual human karma. This human karma increased as the number of individuals evolving their ego principle and separating from th e species group soul increased."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Those souls descending for the first time from plan etary space and incarnated in human bodies stood in a different relation to those souls who had already several ear th lives behind them. The first group of planetary souls brought with them for their earth life only the conditions to which they experienced during their pralaya in t he planetary spheres. The second group of souls added to each su ccessive earth life, the earthly karma they acquire d. Thus, over time, there appeared fewer and fewer of the young p lanetary souls appearing for the first time and mor e and more of the older souls carrying with them the fruits of pa st karma. Thus, the first important aspect to recognize as a result of these two lines of propagation, is the mo on nature of the physical and etheric bodies of evolving humanity. T hat ancestral pair that remained on earth during th e period in the Lemuria Age when the earth-moon planet was united, also survived through that period in the Lemurian A ge when the moon was extruded from the earth. That ancestra l pair, the Mitochondrial Eve, experienced both the union of earth-moon and the separation of earth-moon. After the separation of the moon, the earth bears within it none of those physical elements that detached and went with the moon. Thus, the earth carries within it no tra ce of the moon forces but the human physical and etheric bodies do carry the forces of the moon densification. All ge nerations of Adam and Eve bear the moon influences within the ph ysical and etheric bodies while the astral and ego bodies bear the planetary influences brought by the souls retur ning to earth after the earth-moon separation from Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, etc. The second important aspect to recognize as a resul t of these two lines of propagation, is the planeta ry nature of the astral and ego bodies of evolving humanity. The spi rits of form, the Elohim, have in one way or anothe r always worked upon mans physical and etheric bodies. Thus was accomplished directly from inside when the sun- earth- moon were united. It was accomplished indirectly fr om outside, when the sun separated from the earth-m oon planet. Even after this separation, a part of the Elohim re mained united with the earth during the earth-moon evolution. Then, after the earth-moon separation, the Elohim f orces still worked through Jahue on the moon from t he outside and from the inside through the reserved moon force s in man's physical and etheric bodies. This work of the Elohim from inside and outside, bo th as a separate Elohim from the moon, such as Jeho vah and as united Elohim from the sun, as the Logos can be rec ognized as the Solar Pitris line. This should not b e confused with what was said earlier about the Lunar Pitris b eing the fathers of humanity. To the extent the Spi rits of Form work on the perfect physical body and the higher ch akras of the etheric body, this is the work done by the Solar Pitris. They had a general plan for the development of the physical and etheric bodies carried out by the Solar Pitris. However, this plan was modified by the influence of the Lunar Pitris and our present human form is the result of the combination of the two. The important distinction here is the fundamental u nity of man's physical and etheric bodies, created during the Old Saturn and Old Sun manvantaras, with the Spirits of Form working thru the Solar Pitris generational li ne. The astral body and ego came much later in the history of evol ution and are associated more with the Lunar Pitris who intervened in the normal course of evolution and ag ainst the general plan laid down by the Spirits of Form. As a result of the intervention, the Lunar Pitris are as sociated more with the four lower principles or low er quaternary of man and less with the three higher principles. Now, it was described previously, the Luciferic spi rits in order to complete their own evolution, need ed human sheaths to develop their sixth and seventh principl es. It was also described that these spirits prefer red those humans which had a more developed ego of fourth principle. This type of more advanced human is represented by the first soul type of the older souls descending from the Ad am-Eve line. The union of the older souls with the Luciferic spirits produced the kings, prophets and leaders of humanity Steiner says, \"Although the Luciferic influence made itself felt at first only in the more advanced individuals, it soon spread out to others. The descendants of these advanced human bei ngs intermingled with the less advanced. By this me ans the Luciferic power injected itself into the latter. Th e etheric body of the souls returning from the plan ets could not receive the same degree of protection enjoyed by th e etheric body of those who had remained on earth.\" Steiner refers here to the etheric body. To avoid c onfusion, it should be said that the Luciferic forc es primarily attack the astral body first, but then work into the ether ic and physical bodies over time. Here lay the seeds for the destruction of the Atlan tean races. We know the unevolved ego has its highe r and lower aspects. In its higher aspect it looks up to Manas and in its lower aspect, it is drawn down to kama ( desire) and the sexual principle of JAHVE, the lower quaternary. Th e Solar Pitris angels gave protection of the etheri c body of the older souls of the Adam-Eve descendants. This line of humanity was called the \"Sons of the Sun\" and th e higher ego in these Sun-Men was the Spiritual sun or Christ Sp irit. Not so fortunate, the etheric bodies of the young s ouls returning from the planetary spheres. Their hi gher egos were controlled by the presiding spirit of Motion of eac h respective planet, Jupiter, Mars, etc. The separa tion of spirits followed the recapitulation of the Old Saturn, Old Sun and Old Moon Manvantaras at the beginning of ou r earth"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"evolution. When the sun separated from the common p lanetary mass, the Spirits of Form or Elohim went w ith the sun where they remain. It was their ordained task to guide human evolution with a series of seven etheric bodies, one for eac h of the seven spirits of form. In addition, each of the seven eth eric bodies was to develop in sequential order, fro m first to last, with each sub-race dying out in order, similar to t he way the Neanderthal Man died out with the rise o f the CroMagnon man. However, just the opposite to the Di vine Plan occurred because of the effect of the pla netary spirits during the spiritual pralaya. Instead, the highest planetary spirit of each respe ctive planet decided to create its own separate rac ial line of evolution and in this way, the Atlantean races were distinguished by Jupiter men, Saturn men, Mars men , etc. In addition, the higher ego of each initiate and his f ollowers was controlled by the respective planetary spirit. Thus, instead of seven races evolving under the guidance of the seven Elohim, with Christ as their leader, w e have five planetary races separately evolving, each looking u p to their planetary spirit as leader and highest \" God\". Because of this evolution of diversity instead of u nity, the greatest confusion has evolved among the great spiritual leaders of mankind. For example, the Madame H.P.B. says that Buddha is Mercury, and she is correct. Fo r the Mercury race of incarnating monads, the higher ego of the initiates and religious leaders is the Mercu ry spirit revealed through Buddha. For this reason, they do n ot recognize the Christ as the highest spirit. When their initiates achieve the highest evolution possible, they look u p and find the Mercury planetary spirit, because th ey are in fact generational descendants of the Mercury line. Only the initiates of the Sons of the Sun generational l ine after developing their three higher principles, can look up and find the Christ. In the same way, the initia tes of the Jupiter race of Greeks looked up to Zeus as the highest God . From this it is easy to see that the greatest minds and the most spiritual adepts could never agree th at the Christ Spirit of the Sun man is the highest of the planeta ry spirits. There is a racial prejudice extending a ll the way back to the orgin of their soul life in their respective pl anetary spirits. The Race Spirits A planetary spirit is another term for the logos of a planet. Historically recognized by every religio n, they have been called by the Hindus, the Dhyani-Chohans and Kumara s; by the Gnostics of Alexandria, Ialdaboath and hi s six sons (the Demiurge and the Aeons); by the Kabalists, the lower seven Sephiroth; by the Zoroastrians, the St ar-Yazatas; recognized by the Egyptians in the seven chambers i n the Cheops pyramid; in the mysteries of Samothrac e, the 7 Kabiri; and by the Christians, the planetary Angels or the 7 Spirits before the Presence. They are the Virtues in the second angelic Hierarchy of Dominations, Virtues an d Powers (Spirits of Form) and stand four stages hi gher than mankind. It is easy to confuse these with the Elohim or Spir its of Form because they are both seven in number. The Spirits of Form, which stand three stages higher than mankind, have seven logi, six of them work from the sun and one from the moon. Exoterically, there are also seven planet ary spirits, historically drawing their names from the seven ancient planets as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Merc ury, Venus and Moon. But, herein lies a veil or bli nd. The sun and moon are not related even physically to the other five planets, the sun is higher and the moon is lower. The moon is a planetary corpse of earth and the sun is a fixed star, again not even a planet. Therefor e, it is only exoterically that the sun and moon are included in the numeration of the ancient planets. Esoterically , the sun and moon are blinds for two hidden planets yet to be di scovered or manifested. The sun can be substituted for the planet Vulcan, whose orbit is within the orbit of Mercury, and the moon can be substituted for Uranus. Theref ore, the five ancient planets and the veiled sun and moon represe nt the seven planetary spirits that originally took part in the formation of our solar system. The other planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto did no t belong to the formation of our solar system, but have been captured, and to the extent that they rotate on an axis, they too have planetary spirits, but they are not directly involved in earth evolution as are the ancient plan ets. Thus, the five planets of Saturn, Jupiter, Mar s, Mercury and Venus are manifested in their influence as Race Spi rits and the two veiled planets are unmanifested, k eeping in mind that the planets are also septenary lives that evol ve thru seven stages of embodiment, only the fourth of which is physical. It is also important to keep in mind that the seven rays from the Spirits of Form and the seven rays f rom the five and two planetary spirits all influence the earth and m ankind. Thus, as they interface, each planet is in esoteric conflict within and without by these two sources. Now a certain arrangement had to be made when the m oon extruded or geologically separated out of the e arth. If the moon had remained united, human evolution would not have proceeded as we know it. When certain older S pirits of Motion had decided to remain behind in their evolut ion and not proceed to the hierarchy of Spirits of Wisdom, the normal Spirits of Form had to weaken their strength to maintain the equilibrium required to further ev olution. \" The Spirits of Wisdom established a colony upon the moo n in order to preserve the equilibrium, and so from the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"direction of the moon, compensating spirits work in upon humanity.\" This task was accomplished by the JHVH Elohim splitting off and going with the moon, while the other six Elohim remained united with the sun. The moon does not rotate so it is not inhabited by a Spirit of Motion, but it does pass light, although reflect ed from the sun. Thus, it does embody a Spirit of Form being that Ol d Testament entity known as Jehovah. These held back Spirits of Motion have two faces. A s Spirits of Motion, there are the planetary spirit s whose sphere of influence extends up to each of the five ancient planets. However, in respect to certain qualities in which they have made sacrifice or renunciation, they act also as Spirits of Form. Thus, in a cooperative activity , we have working in our solar system, the activities of the normal Spirits of Form working from the sun and tog ether with the activities of the held back Spirits of Motion, work ing from the other five planets. The effect of this cosmic arrangement is seen most dramatically in the develo pment of the human races. In Genesis the 7 Spirits of Form are called the Elo him and they have their activity centered in the su n. One of these Elohim split off when the earth separated from the moon and He works from the sphere of the moon. The creative forces of the Elohim stream down in the sunlight, s ix rays from the sun and one reflected as polarized light from the moon. Interacting with these rays of the Spirits of Form are the five planetary rays of the held back Spirits of Motion radiating from Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mer cury. As discussed above, after the return to earth of the souls from their spiritual praylaya, each of the planetar y spirits (in cooperation with the Spirits of Form) decided to create its own separate racial line as embodied by a disti nct racial etheric body. They have produced what ar e known as the five root-races. The common human form and a unitar y group soul was each created by the normal Spirits of Form, the racial modifications of this common form comes from the influence of the five planetary spirits al so called Race Spirits. The cooperation of the Mercury Race Spirit has prod uced the negro race characterized by the Ethiopian culture and its activities are reflected in the glandular syste m. The efforts of the Venus Race Spirit has produced t he Malay or yellow race and its activities are refl ected in respiration as it effects the solar plexus and symp athetic nervous system. The efforts of the Mars Race Spirit has produced th e Mongolian race and its activities are reflected i n the blood. The Jupiter Race Spirit has worked into the Aryan-C aucasian race, the predominant type of this Fifth R oot Race age. The Aryan race began in India and worked westwards, so that now, in this cultural epoch, its activitie s are reflected in the peoples of Asia Minor and Western Europe. It s forces stream in through the sense impressions as processed by the higher nervous system of the brain and spina l cord. The last Race Spirit of Saturn works in the brown r ace of the American Indian. Its activities invade t he glandular system tending to ossification and ending in human death. The Saturn spirit brings about the decay and decline of a racial line as represented in the past in the Ameri can Indian and in the future seventh cultural epoch in the American culture. A special modification of these five racial lines o ccurred as a result of the plan of the Spirits of F orm to incarnate the Christ Spirit on earth. Christ should have incarnat ed during the middle of the Atlantean age. This was the time ordained for the Spirits of Form to begin work on t he human ego. However, the matriarchal cultures of the Atlantean peoples lagged behind and were not ready to recogni ze so significant an event. In addition, as a resul t of the Luciferic spirits invading of the human astral body during the Lemurian Age, the descent of the Christ Spirit was delayed as far into the future Aryan Age as the int ervention of the Luciferic spirits lay in the past. For this event a special racial type had to be prep ared to serve as a vehicle for the incarnation of t he macro-cosmic Christ ego. The genealogy of this racial line is pr eserved in the historical description of the 3 X 14 generations of the St. Matthew Gospel. Since the Mars race spirit work s into the blood, a special cooperation had to be e ffected to prevent its activity in the blood line of the Hebre w generations. The spiritual mission of the Hebrew nation to prepare a physical body suitable to host such a gre at spirit, was led by the Jehovah Elohim from the m oon and He worked thru the blood line. For this reason, JHVH i s the God of the Hebrew nation who worked in the bl ood line of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, thru the sons of the Hous e of David and finally He appeared in the birth of the Solomon Jesus child. The Temple Legend In the previous discussion about Soul Food, we saw the profound wisdom of the Cain and Abel offering t o the already predisposed Moon god, Jehovah. In the TEMPL E LEGEND Steiner lectures about another ancient mys tery concerning this ancestral pair of brothers and thei r generational lines. One of the Elohim created the primal mother called Eve in the Genesis Bible story. From their union th e son Cain was born. Then another Elohim, called Adoni or Jeho vah, created the primal man, Adam. From the union o f Adam and Eve the son called Abel was born. Thus, from th e beginning of human evolution, there were two dist inct lines of evolution. Cain killed Abel and the Abel line later descended thru his brother Seth, born later to Ada m and Eve. After the fratricide, Cain travels east of Eden and begets his own race."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The wisdom of this myth relates to our Pitris and t he separation of the races of humankind. The Cain l ine has been called the Sons of Fire and represents the Solar Pi tris generational line in evolution. They are the f arming and gathering peoples who till the soil, the Sons of th e Earth. They are the creators of the arts, languag e and sciences, the workers in metals and ores as taught by Tubal-Cain. The Abel line has been called the Sons of God and r epresents the Lunar Pitris generational line in evo lution. They are the shepard's who take from the earth what it f reely gives without effort and skill. From them des cend the priestly line seen as the Brahmans of the Hindus, t he Magi of the Persians, and the priests of the Tem ple for the Chaldeans, Egyptians and Hebrews. Begining the four th cultural epoch, the priestly line evolves into t he the succession of Kings as rulers of the masses. As suc h, the sons of Cain have been historically subjecte d to the sons of Abel. With the building of King Solomon's temple, these t wo divergent lines came together for a brief reconc iliation. Solomon came from the Abel line of priests and did not have the skills to design and build the temple. For assistance he had to seek the help of Hiram-Abiff, a son of Ca in who had the necessary skills of geometry, metall urgy, architecture and building. Together they built the grand edifice to the Moon God, Jehovah. Although no temple was built for the God of the sons of Cain, the monument to their achievement was to be the casting of the molten sea or brazen sea. This was a huge mold to hold firm in br onze the movement of the waters, which if accomplis hed, would have made Hiram the greatest artisan in history. Without getting into the details of this long story , which forms the ritual of the Third Degree in Mas onry, the casting of the molten sea was destroyed by a conspiracy of three rejected masons seeking revenge upon Hiram. W hen the mold broke, a horrible catastrophe followed spillin g molten metal mixed with water and fire, killing p eople and causing Hiram the greatest humiliation. The importa nt part of the story concerns Solomon who was told by the workman Benoni of the plot and Solomon did nothing to prevent its execution. It seems the great Hebrew king had his own failings of greed and jealousy as Balkis, t he Queen of Sheba, had taken a fondness to the powe r of Hiram. In grief, Hiram threw himself into the furnace that prepared the metal for the molten sea. There he me t the \"father of thy fathers, Tubal-Cain, son of Lamech\" who taught him the weakness of Jehovah, whom we know from the Old Testament to be a vengeful and unforgiving God. He was also told, \" A son shall be born unto thee whom thou shall indeed not see, but whose numerous descendants shal l perpetuate thy race, which, superior to that of A dam, shall acquire the empire of the world...at last the best shall become the strongest, and restore on the eart h the worship of fire. Thy sons, invincible in thy name, shall destr oy the power of kings, the ministers of the Adonai' s tyranny.\" With the help of the grand master Tubal-Cain, Hiram successfully completed the casting of the molten s ea, much to the disappointment of Solomon and again, gained the favor of Queen Balkis. Solomon again hatched a plo t which ended with the murder of Hiram by the three fellow- craftsmen. Historically then, we see an opportunity for the co ming together of the generational lines of the sons of Cain and Abel in the building of King Solomon's temple. Howe ver, King Solomon used this meeting for his own sel fish purposes. First, he builds the temple for his perso nal fame and glory, which he could not have otherwi se done without help from the sons of Cain. Then he plots t o get the favor of Hiram's sweetheart, Queen Balkis and lastly, he consents to a plot that gets Hiram murdered. To add insult to murder, he finally marries the Queen of Sheba and has children with her. Historically then, this opportun ity to merge the generational lines did not occur a s a result of the reprehensible acts of King Solomon. The important part of the prophecy given to Hiram b y Naamah, sister of Tubal-Cain, was that a son was to be born that would destroy the power of Kings. The rule of the sons of Abel began first as priestly rule in th e temples and evolved over time into kingly rule. Historically, w e have seen a transition from kingly rule to Parlia mentary rule and Democratic rule in Western Europe and America. Argu ably, the change from kingly rule to democracy occu rred through the efforts of Rosicrucians in Europe and M asons here in America. The secret history of the Fr ench Revolution and the death of Louis XVI was a case in point. Although Steiner does not identify the name of the son to be born, he does credit the orgin of the Tem ple legend to Father C.R.C., Christian Rosenkreutz in the 14th. a nd 15th. centuries. His birth in 1378 came shortly after the murder of Jacques de Molay and the total genocide o f the Knights Templar in 1314 by Plilip IV King of France and Pope Clement V. Steiner further says that the Rosic rucians were the successors to the esoteric traditi on of the Knights Templar and he also confirms the spiritual identity of Father C.R.C. with the Comte of Saint G ermain.

The Atlantean Races All persons in their successive incarnations pass t hru the various races. Before heredity became the c ontrolling factor of race, the geographical place where a man was born was determinative of racial characteristic s. These geographical locations were controlled by the Spiri ts of Motion, whose influence radiated out of the e arth and determined the whole life of mankind. There is an o riginal development of man as reflected in the Merc ury race in Africa. Here, the forces of the earth imprinted upo n this race the characteristics of early childhood. Moving eastward to Asia, the Venus and Mars spirits imprinted upon the racial type those characteristics of youth. Mov ing westward to Europe, the Jupiter spirits imprinted upon the r acial type the characteristics of early adulthood. Finally, in America the Saturn spirits imprinted upon the brown race, those characteristics dominating the last on e-third of life, being old age and death. Steiner says that the evolution of civilization ass umes the character as shown by a continuation of th e race line and this was a geographic line beginning in Africa, mov ing east to Asia and westward again to Europe and e nding in America. In the American and Mexican Indian and the peoples of the Carribean Islands, we see descendan ts of the Atlantean races struggling to survive. They have no national identity as their folk-soul passed on tho usands of years ago. Under the geographic influence of the Saturn s pirits, these cultures are destined to pass away as racial development follows an ordained path from birth, ch ildhood, youth, middle age and finally, into old ag e and death. The Atlantean races were the first Root Race to str ictly sub-divide into seven racial types following the influences of the Spirits of Form and the race spirits. At variou s times during the evolution of the Atlantean races , migrations took place out of Atlantis to various geographical locat ions on the earth where they could receive the corr ect racial cultivation. The guidance of this distribution of r aces took place in the Mystery centers of various A tlantean Oracles. For example, the Manu of the Mercury Oracle guided his peoples to Africa to cultivate the Ethopian rac e. In this way, the earth was populated by the racial types un der the guidance of the Oracles of the Spirits of M otion. For this reason, as discussed above, the initiates of each O racle looked up to their corresponding planetary sp irit as its own \"God\". From a portion of the elect and most advanced of th e Lemurian Third root-race, the first sub-race of t he Atlanteans developed. The task of this Fourth Root Race was to develop memory and language in the sense that the task of the Fifth Ayran Root Race is to develop Manas or cognit ive thought. Drawing from Theosophical sources, in COSMIC MEMORY Steiner describes the seven sub-races. The first sub-race was called the Rmoahals. Here, t he vestiges of speech began and as memory increased so did the development of language. The word was sacred, magic al and powerful. The second sub-race was called the Tlavatli. Here, with the development of communal life, ancestral me mory began. With the great deeds of men being preserved through memory, leaders emerged and their legacy was vener ated through an ancestor cult worship. The third sub-race was called the Toltecs whose des cendants after emigration, consisted primarily of t he Mayan Indians of the American continent. Here, the social community reached full development into an autocra tic type state government, led by a king whose power and aut hority was passed from generation to generation. The fourth sub-race was called the primal Turanians . Here, occurred the development of personality and ambition, which combined with an autocratic government, cause d tribal wars and slavery. The fifth sub-race was called the Primal Semites. I n them, the origins of logical, cognitive thinking began as memories were compared and combined. The faculty of judgment developed. From this sub-race were chosen those persons led by the Jupiter Manu to begin and popula te the future Fifth Root Race after the decline of the Atlantean race. In the sixth sub-race, that of the Akkadians, the f aculty of thought developed further into the origin of regulations of law and justice. Colonization began, and with it, t he commerce of trade between tribes and nations. In the last sub-race, that of the Mongols, the path of thought developed in the fifth and sixth sub-ra ces, sort of turned in upon itself, returning to the vestiges of the fo urth sub-race. Ancestral memory and ancestor cult w orship returned as a stronger force over the ascending Manas force, which effects can still be seen today in the Chine se culture. 3. THE UNITY OF THE RACES Sacrifice of the Ram"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Christ event represents the fusion of three mys tery streams of occult knowledge, that of Buddhism, Zoroastrianism and Old Testament Judaism. In discus sing the evolution of mankind, the Hebrew Semitic s ub-race plays the most important role in the Aryan Root Rac e. As a sub-race, the Hebrews had their beginning in t he fifth sub-race of the Fourth Atlantean Root Race . They were called the Primal Semites and in them was laid the seed for logical, cognitive thinking. After the des truction of Atlantis, the most advanced from this sub-race were lead by the Manu from Ireland eastward across Euro pe and the Middle East to the Indus Valley to start the first (Hindu) sub-race of the Fifth Root Race. The purpose of the Fifth Root Race was to develop M anas on the physical plane and the quality the Manu looked for in these peoples was that of the intellect. The ter m \"most advanced\" used above for this sub-race does not mean the best hunters, farmers or shepards, but the most adv anced in the power of critical thinking. As the Manu led the migration from Atlantis across Europe and the Middle East, certain portions of the peoples separated off and began independent cultures along the way. Those that eventually populated the Indus Valley and began the Hindu cultural epoch were not the most ad vanced in respect of intellect, although they had o ther qualities. Those peoples who later become the Semites in the t hird and fourth cultural epochs, stayed in the Midd le East area and populated their generations. ne contribution made by the Hebrews was the prepara tion of the physical body to become a vessel for th e incarnation of the Christ ego. The Christ could not inhabit an unsuitable body as represented in the e volving sub- races of the Aryan Age. For this reason, simultaneo usly with the descent of Christ thru the heavenly s pheres, the physical, etheric and astral bodies of the Hebrew n ation was being prepared thru the 3 X 14 generation s of the St. Matthew Gospel, begining with Abraham. The entire H ebrew nation descended from his son, Isaac and the generations from him cumulated in the birth of a si ngle person, the Solomon Jesus child. The more important contribution made by the Hebrew nation also began with Abraham and Steiner calls th is the \"sacrifice of the ram.\" When Abraham came from the land of Ur or Chaldea, h e met with Melchizedek, the most high priest of (Jeru)Salem. This meeting is memorialized in Genesi s with the gifts of bread and wine. But Melchizedek must have given Abraham something else if he was destined to be the seed for the nation ordained to bear the inc arnation of Christ. We know from OCCULT SCIENCE that the etheric bodies of the seven highest initiates of the Atlantean or acles were preserved, this in accordance with the princip le of Spiritual Economy. \"The sun (Christ) oracle knew the secret of produci ng, for this or that individual, the kind of human ether bodies that were possessed by the highest initiates of the othe r oracles. With this means at their disposal, count er parts of the most perfect ether bodies of the ancient initiates were preserved and later implanted in the individua ls best fitted for the purpose\" Safekeeping of these etheric bodies was given to th e Sun oracle who distributed them to the new oracle s of the Fifth post-Atlantean Age. The type of etheric bodies pres erved were those that had the least degree of separ ation between the physical and etheric bodies. Such persons were best suited to guide evolution through the age of t he descent of Manas. They had less spirituality but had more thin king ability. Co-equal with this development was th e separation of the individual ego from the Atlantean group ego. The loss of ancestral memory was inversely proport ional to the rise of the thinking or Manas function of the ego. Steiner says, \"the part of the ether body bound to the physical body transformed the physical brain into the actual orga n of thought and only from that time onward did the human being feel his ego in the physical body.\" Now, it is both an occult law and a biological law that every human capacity must have its beginning i n one human individuality. Such is required by the gene pool whether it be the convolutions of Brocca's brain for the faculty of speech or the larynx of the future androgynous man for the facult y of Kriyashakti to give birth from the power of th e Logos. Abraham was the first person in whom the faculty of cognitive thought first occurred in the gene pool. This is why he was recognized as the founder of mathematics. In the GOSPEL OF ST. MATTHEW, Steiner identifies Me lchizedek as the great initiate of the Sun oracle, in whom resides the power of producing etheric bodies of an cient initiates. In order not to confuse Abraham, M elchizedek appeared at their meeting bearing the etheric body of Shem, son of Noah, and progenitor of the Semitic sub-race after the Atlantean flood. To Abraham was imparted an etheric body of the type preserved by the Sun or acle within which the physical organ of human cognitive thought had its beginning. The cosmic purpose of this organ of analytical, cal culating reason was to develop the thinking functio n of the micro- cosmic human ego. It was truely a gift from the God s. The meeting of the Sun oracle with Abraham was v eiled in the Old Testament story of the meeting with Melchiz edek. Likewise, the gift of the organ of thinking w as veiled in the Bible story of the sacrifice of Isaac."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"This story is nowhere told more beautifully then in THE BOOK OF JASHER which one can hardly read witho ut a feeling of piety and dignity. Interestingly, Satan appears four times to Abraham while traveling the r oad to Mount Moriah with his sons Isaac and Ishmael. The first t ime Satan \"appeared to Abraham in the figure of a v ery aged man, humble and contrite of spirit\" and tried to pe rsuade Abraham from making the sacrifice. But he \"k new it was the word of Satan who endeavored to draw him aside from the way of the Lord\" and Abraham rebuked him s o that he went away. A second time Satan returned and came to Isaac in t he figure of a young man, comely and well favored. Again Satan was rebuked. A third time, Satan realizing he could not prevail over them, transformed himself into a brook, large and powerful as the mighty waters. As the travelers passed thru the stream, the water reached their ne cks and they were terrified. Suddenly, Abraham recognized the pl ace and he knew there was no water there before. A last time he rebuked Satan saying, \"The Lord rebuke thee, O Sata n, begone from us for we go by the commands of God. \" After Abraham was told by the Lord to substitute \"t he ram which the Lord God had created in the earth in the day that He made earth and heaven\", Satan again appeare d and caught the hold of the ram and entangled his horns in the thicket. Abraham freed the ram, placed it upon the alter for sacrifice and sprinkled some of its blood upon the alter, after which the Lord blessed Abraham and his seed. It is interesting to observe the many temptations m ade by Satan to prevent this event so important to the evolution of the Christ impulse. Steiner says that the sacrifice of Isaac was a symb ol of the sacrifice of the ancient clairvoyant thin king function of the ego, which had to be progressively eliminated f rom our gene pool so that the new cognitive thinkin g function of the ego, as represented by the generations of Abrah am, could develop in our Fifth Root Race. \"The last faculty to be given up in exchange for th e gift of the Hebrew people was connected with the sign of the Ram. Therefore, a ram was sacrificed in the place o f Isaac (and) from Isaac the entire Hebrew nation d escended.\" Steiner further discloses a greater occult secret w hen he says that,\"the two horns of the ram symboliz e the sacrifice of the two-petalled lotus flower.\" This two-petalle d lotus flower is the sixth chakra of the etheric b ody corresponding to the brow. In Eastern Occultism, it is the AJNA center called the third eye and is connected with the pituitary g land and the autonomic nervous system. Situated between the eye brows, it is the seat of intuition and cognitive fa culties on the one hand and of clairvoyance on the other hand. As C.W. Leadbeater pointed out, technically, there are 96 spokes to this chakra but it is mentioned in the Hindu tradit ion as having only two petals, because it, \"has the appearance of being divided into halves, one chiefly rose clored, though with a great deal of yellow about it, and t he other predominately a kind of purplish-blue.\" Traditional Hindu occultism recognizes this center as a white lotus with two petals bearing the letters h and ks with a white tr iangle, apex pointing downward. What then was given to Abraham by the Sun oracle wa s an etheric body which for the first time in evolu tion had the template of the physical body's organ for cognitive thought. However, in this etheric body, the brow c hakra, representing the ancient clairvoyant thinking facul ty as reflected in ancestral memory, was closed. Th e evolutionary plan of the Spirits of Form was to close this brow chakra so that after the evolution of cognitive tho ught in the Aryan age, this chakra could be re-opened to emerge at a higher level. In the future Sixth Root Race, this g ift would be given back to mankind, so that clairvoyance could p roceed from a person fully grounded in analytical, calculating and logical reasoning. Esoterically, these two peta ls of the ANJA chakra were closed and symbolized by the sacrifice of the ram. The Fall of Mankind-One Key This is not the first time in the evolution of the races that the Spirits of Form had withheld a gift from the Gods. As the good Madame H.P.B. says, every great symbol has seven levels of meaning and seven keys. One of the keys to the \"fall of mankind\" as reflected in the Garden of Eden Genesis story, is the withholding of the high er chakras in the etheric body. Before the fall, the Spirits of Form had designed t he human form with seven fully operative and functi oning chakras within the human etheric body. The chakras correspo nd in the micro-cosmic principles of man to that, w hich in turn, correspond to the macro-cosmic principles of the Co smic Elements, known in Eastern Occultism as the TA TTVAS, as follows: CHAKRA TATTVAS COSMIC ELEMENT 1. Crown Adi Divine (Life-ether) 1 st . Logos 2. Brow Anupadaka Spirit (sound-ether) 2 nd Logos 3. Throat Akasha Aether (light-ether) 3rd Logos 4. Heart Tejas Fire Ether 5. Solar/plexus Vayu Air 6. Sacral Apas Water 7. Coccygeal Prithivi Earth"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"However, during the Lemurian age of the Third Root Race, our Lunar Pitris, the followers of Lucifer, i mplanted themselves into the astral body of mankind. The res ults of this are also sevenfold, but, generally spe aking, this descent into matter, earth passion, desire, freedom , evil, etc., was earlier than intended by the Spir its of Form. The effects of this event could not be reversed and the possibility existed, that over time, the course of evolution would require the Luciferic forces to also invade the eth eric body of mankind. If this occurred, the results would be devastating to mankind because of the super-human powers contai ned in the three higher chakras of the etheric body. For this reason, the Spirits of Form withdrew the h igher chakras of the etheric body to be preserved f or a later time in the Sixth and Seventh Root Races, when mankind w ould be more highly evolved and mature. Thus, one k ey to the mystery of the Fall of Mankind, was the intenti onal closing by the Elohim of the higher chakras an d the function of their corresponding organs, the larynx, pituitar y and pineal glands. For example, in the throat chakra, Steiner speaks i n KNOWLEDGE OF THE HIGHER WORLDS that during an earlier stage of evolution, eight of the sixteen sp okes had been closed and ceased their activity. The eight-fold path of the Buddha was an esoteric path to re-open them and attain their full intended use. \"Man can now de velop the remaining 8 petals by means of conscious exercises, thereby, the whole lotus flower becomes luninous a nd mobile.\" In Eastern Occultism, the good Madame H.P.B. speaks of the KRIYASHAKTI force. This has the power of producing on the physical plane material forms and objects through the potency of Will and Ideation. I t was this force that caused androgynous man in the Lemurian ( pre-Fall) root races to produce offspring without a sexual"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"union. In Western Occultism, it is this force that Steiner says will manifest itself in the future Six th Root Race in the human (male) larynx to likewise reproduce without s exual union out of itself with the power of the cre ative word. If the power of this reproductive force were not withh eld, mankind would most likely experience a second Fall, because of the failure of present humans to control the passions of the astral body. Also, the ego functions of thinking, feeling and wi lling are reflected in the higher chakras and highe r trinity of micro-cosmic principles. To the extent that a perso n has consciously transformed his astral, etheric a nd physical bodies, he has partially obtained, Manas, Buddhi an d Atma. To a certain extent, all of mankind has ach ieved Manas and Buddhi, through the feeling and willing functio n of the ego. This is now more or less achieved unc onsciously or instinctively by the work of angels in the astral b ody. All persons can say \"I feel\" and \"I will\" and their functions are reflections from the light ether and fire ether of the macro-cosmic elements. Therefore, we can say th ese chakras are partially open as Steiner says about the throat cha kra. However, we cannot say \"I think\" as reflected from the sound ether thru the brow chakra nor can we hav e the cosmic wisdom of \"oneness\" as reflected from the life-ethe r thru the crown chakra. This is a difficult concep t to understand because, at first glance, of course every one belie ves he can think separate thoughts. But as Steiner says in THE GOSPEL OF ST. LUKE, \" Whereas each man's feeling an d will are personal, we immediately come into somet hing universal when we rise into the realm of words and the realm of thoughts. No one individual can form t houghts that are his alone.\" And the secret to understanding thi s concept is said, \"If thoughts were as individual as feelings we should never understand one another.\" Our words create a cognitive set from which our tho ughts arise. This is the basis for the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity that the thinking of a partic ular culture is affected by the structure of the la nguage it speaks. Words have their orgin in the sound ether and this ether extends upwards to the sphere of the moon. Wh ere there is a common language, there is a common or uniform thoug ht pool from which are drawn our thoughts. The Spir its of Form closed the chakra thru which this sound ether manifests itself in the human body. Likewise, the c hakra was closed thru which the life ether gives meaning or t he wisdom of \"one-ness\" to cognitive thought. Thus, there is a great difference in the etheric bo dies of mankind from before the Fall and after the Fall. It is thru the path of initiation and adeptship that these closed chakras are restored. The Lost Pleiad The mission of the Hebrew nation was at least two-f old. First, their spiritual task was to prepare a p hysical body thru the 3 X 14 generations suitable for the incarnation of the macro-cosmic Christ ego. Second, their evol utionary task was to extinguish the mental faculty of the ancient clairvoyance and instill in mankind the physical o rgan of cognitive thought. The sacrifice of the ram was in a very real sense also the sacrifice of the Hebrew nation as a sub- race for over 2,000 years, until the birth of Israe l in the 20th. century. There are many references to the ancient legend of the lost Pleiad, although I personally have never c ome across it. In every great symbol there are seven levels and se ven keys, one of which is the astronomical key. Thi s key has been preserved in the tauroctony or bull-slaying scene f rom the ancient mysteries of Mithras. Mithraism and Christianity fiercely competed for th e souls of Western man from the first century A.D. to the end of the fourth century, when Constantine converted the Roman Empire to Christianity and the edict of Emper or Theodosius abolished by law the practice of the anc ient mysteries. Arising at the same time and coveri ng the same geographic area, Mithraism was truly, \"the road not taken by Western civilization.\" The scene of initiation for the candidates of Zarat hustra were subterranean caves on the ceiling of wh ich were symbols of the planets and the zodiac. Likewise, th e initiations into the seven grades of the mysterie s of Mithras occurred in a stone vault, now called a Mithraeum, which were also located underground or in temples m ade to look subterranean. Hundreds of these vaults survive to t he present day and common to all of them was the ce ntral symbol of the tauroctony carved in stone."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" The central icon is the scene of Mithras slaying th e bull with a sword placed in its shoulder.

Being familiar with the solar year of the pr ecession of the equinoxes (our Messianic cycle), he places Mithras on the celestial equator as it was when the spring equinox was in the constellation of Taurus and the fall equinox wa s in Scorpio rather than now in the 20th. century w hen the spring equinox is in Aries. Starting with the spring equin ox in Taurus, and moving west, the celestial equato r passes through the following constellations: Taurus, the b ull; Canis Major, the dog; Hydra, the snake; Crater , the cup; Corvus, the raven and Scorpius, the scorpion. In ad dition, the two torchbearers who usually appear in the scene, as Cautes represents the spring equinox and Cautopates represents the fall equinox. Lastly, with the spri ng equinox in Taurus, the summer solstice appears in Leo, the lio n. Ulansey's key is that \"the taurocotony represents t he astronomical situation which obtained during the epoch in which the spring equinox was in Taurus \""},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" and his conclusion is that the bull-slaying represe nts the death of the previous astronomical Age of T aurus brought about by the solar precession .

Porphyry also describes Mithras as bearing the swor d of Aries, which he says is \"the sign of Mars.\" As described above in The Race Spirits, we know that the Hebrew nation had a special relationship with the Mars rac e spirit so that Jehovah could work in the Hebrew blood line of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to secure the 3 X 14 gene rations. Thus, on a higher level of correspondence, the Mith raic taurocotony represents a Spirit of Form (an El ohim of Genesis) slaying the bull (the Age of Taurus) with the sword of Mars placed in the celestial position of the seven stars of the Pleiades. As a result of this slaying that occured during the Age of Taurus, one of the s even sisters of the Pleiades is sacrificed or \"lost\" as represented by the position where the sword enters the shoulder. In the SECRET DOCTRINE the good Madame says,\"the co nstellations of the Great Bear and the Pleiades con stitute the greatest mystery of occult nature...the six pre sent and the one hidden.\" Most importantly, she als o says, \"the Pleiades were at one time the Atlantides and connec ted with Atlantis and its seven races.\" We learned above that the Primal Semites were an original sub-race, the fifth of the Atlantean Age. I would suggest that the \"greatest mystery\" of occu lt nature is now solved. The lost Pleiad represents the Hebrew nation after the sacrifice of the ram by Abraham an d this event occured during the Age of Taurus and i ts astronomical key is represented by the Mithraic tau rocotony. The Universal Human As we discussed before, the seven Spirits of Form h ad a general plan of earth evolution which was modi fied when the Spirits of Motion held back and became Race Spi rits that populated the Atlantean Age with racial v arieties. The evolution of these racial varities has been much co mmentated on in such books as A.P. Sinnett's ESOTER IC BUDDHISM and of course in THE SECRET DOCTRINE. In T heosophical parlance it was commonplace to speak of the progress of the Messianic cycles or cultural epochs of 2,160 years as co-equal with the evoluti on of the 7 X 7 sub-races for each Root Race. However, Steiner has commented on several occasions that the differentiation of racial characteristics was a dominant factor only in the Atlantean root Races. A s we progress over time, thru the Fifth (Aryan) Roo t Race and into the future Sixth Root Race, the significance o f racial diversity will diminish over time."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The etheric body is the template of the physical bo dy. Aside from racial characteristics our physical bodies are the same. However, there are seven distinct types of et heric bodies spread over mankind. The differences b etween these seven types correspondingly makes people different. The seven colors of the etheric body reflect the s even rays of the Spirits of Form. Although we can say that the f ive race spirits have produced the five basic human racial types, originally there were seven types, two of which hav e disappeared. The plan of the Spirits of Form was to have these s even racial types with their seven etheric bodies p roceed successively in evolution beginning the first sub-r ace of the Atlantean Age. Then, the first type of e theric body would have predominated as a racial form over the d uration of that epoch. Then, during the sixth sub-r ace, the second etheric bodily type would have dominated, an d so on consecutively seven times until the end of the fourth sub-race of the Fifth Root Race. However, the forces of Lucifer and Ahriman worked a gainst this plan as they work against all the plans of the Spirits of Form. Evolution is designed to have a beginning, middle and end. To the extent that any evolutionar y force holds back past its planned termination, Luciferic forces are at work. When, for example, certain Spirits of the Age do not pass on at the end of an epoch, but hold back to ma intain their influence over peoples of the next epo ch, this is the result of Luciferic forces, throwing a body block a cross the path of normal evolution designed by the Spirits of Form. During the Atlantean age, Luciferic forces held bac k and preserved the racial forms so that the first type developed alongside the second, and the first and second type developed alongside the third, and so on. Thus, in stead of consecutive development there was concurrent evolut ion of the seven etheric types that obviously exten ds to this present day. The plan of the Elohim was to have one common human racial and etheric type, drawn from a n unitary group soul, begining the fifth cultural epoch (1413 A.D.). One result of this plan was that the physical body as developed during the fourth cultural epoch of th e Greek- Romans, was at its peak on the evolutionary scale. This highest human form was reflected in the sculpt ure of the Greeks in the Apollo-Zeus-Mercury types. Our human bodies are now on the descending arc of that curve beginning the fifth sub-race of Atlantis. Additionally, had this divergence of the racial typ es continued as before past the Greek-Roman cultura l epoch, evolution would have required the differentiation i nto seven separate and distinct racial types, each as different from each other as is a separate animal species. What we consider as racism now, would progressively worsen into a condition where the different racial types would no t regard each other as belonging to the same specie s. The Spirits of Form had to counteract this real evo lutionary force separating humanity into seven ethe ric groups. The solution was to send the Christ Spirit to earth to incarnate in a human body. After the Mystery of Golgotha, the Christ impulse works in two ways to restore both th e physical and etheric bodies of mankind. As concerns the physical body, we said before that the outer human form was at its peak during the Gre ek-Roman cultural epoch. However, the inner human form was a t its lowest. Steiner in FROM JESUS TO CHRIST (1911 ) describes what he calls the human \"phantom\" as the \"form-shape which as a spiritual texture works up t he physical substances and forces so that they fill out the (hu man) form which we encounter on the physical plane. \" Further he says, \"At the beginning of human evolution it was intende d that the phantom should remain untouched by the m aterial elements that man takes for his nutrition from the plant, animal and mineral kingdoms. But it did not remain untouched, for the Luciferic influence brought abou t a close connection between the phantom and the fo rces which man absorbs through his earthly evolution...Since t he beginning of earth existence man has lived in a physical body which is subject to destruction, which cannot adequ ately counter the destructive forces with upbuildin g forces...Man has lost the form of the physical body.\" In Eastern occultism, the good Madame H.P.B. calls this phantom body the \"Auric Body\" or egg which, \"is the chief principle of all, the luminous egg (H iranyagarbha) of the invisible magnetic sphere in w hich every man is enveloped. It is the direct emanation (a) from t he Atmic Ray in its triple aspect and (b) from Budd hi-Manas. The seventh aspect of this individual aura is the facul ty of assuming the form of its body and becoming th e 'radiant', the Luminous Augoeides...the reason why public mention of the auric Body was not permitted was on account of its being so sacred. It is this body which, at death, a ssimilates the essence of Buddhi and Manas and beco mes the vehicle of these sacred principles, which are not o bjective, and then, with the full radiation of Atma upon it ascends as Manas-Taijasi into the Devachanic state...It is the silver thread which incarnates from the beginni ng of the manvantara to the end, stringing itself upon the pe arls of human existance. After death , the Auric bo dy remains either in the Devachanic state of consciousness, or in the case of an Adept, prefers the state of a Ni rmanakaya.\" Our physical bodies have evolved over millions of y ears from the original body of the Adam of Genesis. As a result of Luciferic influences invading our bodies since t he Lemurian age, our phantom or auric egg has given over to"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"disease, dysfunction, destruction and death. This o f course was not the intention of the Spirits of Fo rm who reside within the phantom body. Christ, thru the Mystery o f Golgotha, came to change all of this. On another level of correspondence, the deteriorati on of the inner body of mankind resulted from the h istorical necessity of the liberation of the EGO, which also had been in preparation since the middle of the Atl antean Age. Dr. Steiner says in THE EVOLUTION OF THE WORLD AND OF HUMANITY (1923), \"The astral body before the year 333 A.D. was such that the greater part, the more active part of it, was in the upper part of man and the less active part in the lower m an; the middle man lying between the two. By reason of the upper part of the astral body being more powerful in thos e olden times, the higher Divine Spiritual beings w ere able to exercise thru it their great influence on human bei ngs. It was part of the plan for the whole evolutio n of humanity that it should progress in a certain way: while tha t was the condition of man's astral body about 3,00 0 B.C., at about 1,000 B.C., the lower part of the astral body had c onsiderably increased in size while the upper part had proportionately decreased. In the year 333 A.D., ho wever, the upper part was about equal to the lower. This was the crises that occurred in the year 333 A.D. Since tha t time the upper part of the astral body has consta ntly decreased in size and man's development is furthered by this...I f man had not experienced this diminution of the up per part of his astral body, the ego would not have gained sufficie nt influence; he would never have become free\". The problem here is the old double edged sword of t he inversely proportional relationship. It is from the upper half of the astral body that man derives the strength to control the etheric an physical bodies. Thus, by r educing the size of the upper part, the health of all humanity would gradually diminish. The price of a free will was b ought at the expense of increased illness. However, this fatal e volutionary impulse was overcome by the death of Ch rist and His resurrection in the glorious phantom body Just prio r to 333 A.D., the healing forces of the phantom bo dy of Christ forever entered earth evolution. The physical body in which He incarnated at the tim e of the baptism at Jordan, had been prepared thru the 3 X 14 generations of the St. Matthew Gospel. Between the ages of twelve and thirty, the ego-less Nathan Jesu s child resided in this human sheath. When the Christ Ego i ncarnated in the physical, etheric and astral bodie s of the Nathan Jesus child, for the first time on earth since the \"fall\" of Adam, an ego was present in a human body that was untouched by the influences of Lucifer and Ahriman. For the three years between the baptism and the cr ucifixation, the Christ Spirit lived in a human body, the phanto m of which had never been in the course of human ev olution. After His death and resurrection, what Mary Magdale ne and the apostles saw as the figure of the risen Christ, was this luminous phantom, the Augoeides of Christ. Christ left the seed of this phantom body for us on earth. In the past, when man returned from Devacha n to incarnate on earth, he brought with him for his next earth li fe, the defective phantom which had been given over to disease, destruction and death. \"With Christ there rose out of the grave a kind of kernel for the reconstructio n of our human phantom, and it is possible for this kernel to inco rporate itself in those individuals who find a conn ection with the Christ impulse.\" To the extent that a person takes in the Christ impulse, he also takes in part of the phantom body of Christ, which transforms the Adam Auric egg into th e Christ Auric egg. Similarly, during the evolution of Christianity ove r the fifth, sixth and seventh cultural epochs, tho se Christians that possess a transformed phantom body, share a common humanity with a rejuvenated physical and etheric bo dy. In sharing the phantom body of Christ, humanity can un ite the otherwise natural diversity of racial types . In the same sense that the physical body of mankind could be tr aced back to the Adam body, now and in the future, the phantom body of persons in whom the Christ Spirit dwells, c an be traced back to the second Adam, the Christ. T his is the path in which humanity unites thru the physical bod y. The other path is thru the etheric body which is re flected on the astral plane and this relates to the mystery of the Second Coming. Today, as we draw near the end of the second millen nium, much is said about the Second Coming of Chris t. However, it must be made perfectly clear that this does not mean a return to earth in a physical body as mankind experienced in the Mystery of Golgotha. This extrao rdinary feat of white magic will never occur again and damn the torpedoes for those who say it will. One level of e xplanation is as follows. Christ united with humanity only because the possib ility existed that a held back portion of the ether ic body was preserved in the spiritual worlds and did not parti cipate in the \"Fall of Mankind\" as reflected in the Genesis Bible story. We discussed above that, \"the Spirits of For m withdrew the higher chakras of the etheric body t o be preserved for a later time.\" We know from the teachings of St einer that in the Nathan Jesus child, there existed a human soul that went back to Adam before the Fall and this fac t is reflected in the generations narrated in the S t. Luke Gospel. He says, \" the etheric substance withheld from Adam had been preserved and sent down to this child.\" The fall of mankind is a symbol for the interventio n by the spirits of Lucifer into the astral body of man beginning the middle of the Lemurian Third root race. Likewis e, mankind experienced a second fall beginning the middle of the Atlantean Fourth Root Race when the spirits of Ahriman invaded the etheric body. And since the mid dle of the"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Aryan Fifth Root Race, the Asuras began to invade m ankind's physical body, which in the future epochs will cause an evil far greater than that caused by the legions of Lucifer and Ahriman. Christ did not incarnate in the body of the Solomon Jesus child because this body participated in huma n evolution with numerous incarnations since the fall. As great and good was the ego of Zarathustra, his astral bo dy given to Hermes and his etheric body given to Moses, it was tainted by the forces of Lucifer and Ahriman that e xisted after the fall. Only in the Nathan child did an etheric b ody exist that was the brother of Adam as it existe d before the Fall, that had no previous incarnations and as such did n ot carry the karma of earthly evolution. The reason why there is no Second Coming is that th is brother soul of Adam was spent on the Nathan Jes us child (and also on St. John the Baptist) and none others exist in the spiritual worlds. At the age of twelve , when the Nathan Jesus child cast off his astral body, it ros e upward and united with the Nirmanakaya of the Bud dha. Thus, at the Temple scene, the Nathan child consisted of a p hysical body, an etheric body of an Adam type that bore no earthly karma, an astral body that was united with the Nirmanakaya of the Buddhi, that also bore no ea rthly karma and the ego of Zarathustra. This person lived on ea rth from age twelve until age thirty when at the ba ptism at the Jordan, the macro-cosmic Christ ego descended and r eplaced the micro-cosmic Zarathustra ego. This inca rnation of the Christ ego into the sheaths of the Nathan child was a tremendous chance of white magic and a once in evolution event, never to be repeated again. This is what the occult law of sacrifice means. At every level of evolution, in each of the nine level s of the Angelic Hierarchies, the possibility exists for a spiritual being to hold itself back, to renounce its advance to the next hierarchy, in order to preserve the possibility of redemption at a critical moment in evolution. Of th ose Solar Pitris who \"refused to create\", the angel of the Nathan Je sus ego held back descent to the physical plane unt il the age of King Herod. In a similar way but on a higher level in the Hiera rchies, the arch-angelic body of the Christ Spirit itself held back during both the Old Sun and Old Moon manvantaras to preserve the possibility of the redemption of mank ind in the future Earth Round. Even if Christ could descend th ru the spheres again, as He did prior to the Myster y of Golgotha, He could descend only so far as an angelic body bec ause his physical body has been spent. The fruits o f this physical body of the Nathan child is represented by the Phantom body discussed above. After His crucifixion on Golgotha, Christ experienc ed physical death in every sense that we do when we die. As such, His higher principles are ascending upwards t hru the spheres in the opposite direction that He d escended downwards thru the spheres to incarnate here on ear th. Now a normal person after death also discards h is physical and etheric bodies and ascends thru the astral worl ds of Kama-Loka (purgatory) and then the divine sph eres of lower and upper Devachan (heaven). Then, with his phantom body or auric-egg bearing the seed of his higher t rinity of Manas, Buddhi and Atma, he descends down thru the s pheres to another earth incarnation. What draws man back to earth for repeated incarnations in a physical body is his karma, his unpaid debt owed to the physical plane. With the Christ, the situation is entirely differen t. As discussed above, the etheric body of the Nath an child bore no earthly karma from prior incarnations and his astra l body was perfected by none other than the Buddha, now residing in his Dharmakaya body in Nirvana. The Chr ist ego, during His three and one half years of the ministry, also bore no earthly karma. Therefore, after the ph ysical death at Golgotha, the resurrected phantom b ody of Christ, carrying His higher six principles, bore no karma t o return to earth. Christ, like a Buddha who enters Nirvana, can never incarnate in a physical body again because there i s no karma to connect Him to the physical plane. Like a Buddha, w ho still continues to help mankind in a physical bo dy of a Bodhisattva thru his Nirmanakaya on the astral plan e, Christ continues to help mankind thru his angeli c body. But, both the Buddha and the Christ can appear only so f ar down as the astral-etheric plane, never again on the physical plane. It is for these reasons that Steiner says that ther e is no Second Coming of Christ in a physical body on earth. Christ will return in an angelic body on the astral-etheri c plane where He can be experienced clairvoyantly b y those persons who can raise themselves to this level. It is at this etheric level that those who can say \"th e Christ in me\" will unite mankind in a universal brotherhood, rega rdless of nation or religion. A true unity of human ity from within to oppose the diversity of humanity arising from wi thout by the race spirits. In CHRIST IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY (1913) Steiner s ays, \"When the Mystery of Golgotha took place, the earth ly body of Jesus of Nazareth was given over to the elements of the earth and from that time onwards Christ has bee n united with the spiritual (etheric) sphere of the earth and lives within it...He manifests Himself directly as an ang el...This angelic being, who since then has been an outer form assumed by Christ, suffered an extinction of consci ousness in the course of the intervening 19 centuri es as a result of the opposing materialistic forces brought into the spiritual worlds...This onset of unconsciousness in the spiritual worlds will lead to the resurrection of the Christ consciousness in the souls of men on earth...from t he 20th. century"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"onwards, an ever increasing number of persons will be capable of perceiving the manifestation of the E theric Christ, that is, Christ in the form of an angel\" In the fourth Greek-Roman cultural epoch, Christ ap peared in a physical body on the physical plane. In the fifth epoch, beginning the 20th. century, Christ will app ear in an angelic form on the astral plane. In the sixth epoch, Christ will appear in an astral form on the lower Devachan plane to prepare for the coming of the Maitreya Buddha. In the seven th epoch, Christ will appear on the higher Devachan plane. \"I am with you always, even unto the end of the world .\" Conclusion In conclusion, the Law of Seven teaches that evolut ion begins with the one in unity, in this case the plan of the Spirits of Form, and then separates into the Three, the three-fold sun and diversifies into the Seven, in this case the plan of the Race Spirits. After the evolution of th e septenary, there is a return towards unity, which in this case is the unification of humanity through the Christ impulse. The secret of evolution and of the spiritual guidan ce of humanity has not been better stated than by S teiner in THE GOSPEL OF ST. LUKE, \"In order that humanity may advance, provision has always been made for two streams of civilization, o ne of which receives into itself the rudiments of certain facul ties and elaborates them, while development of the other, adjacent, stream is as it were held back. The one stream deve lops certain faculties to a suitable degree-faculti es which are then essentially part of this stream and of the men belo nging to it. Evolution proceeds, and something new appears; but the first stream would not be capable of rising to a higher stage through its own powers. Provision ha s therefore to be made for another stream to run side by side with it. This second stream remains in a certain respec t undeveloped, having not nearly researched the level of the first ; nevertheless it continues its course and is event ually able to benefit from the faculties acquired by the first. H aving in the intervening period remained youthful, it is able, later on, to rise higher. Thus the one stream has fertili zed the other. Spiritual streams must run their cou rse side by side in this way in the evolution of humanity and provision must be made accordingly by the spiritual guidance of the world\" SYMBOLS OF SEVEN 1. Cube and Triangle The most simple symbol for the septenary in man is the division by Sinnett into the lower quaternary r epresented by a square and the higher triad represented by the tr iangle,(alchemical symbol )as follows: 7. Atma 6. Buddhi 5. Manas 4. Ego (Kama Rupa) 3. Astral (Linga Sartha) 2. Etheric (Prana)"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"1. Physical Body Again, we see our factors of the three and the four , now this time as the number seven as a compound o f the three and four. The reason for this correspondence is bec ause the Law of Seven is the factor element in natu re and the occultists recognizing this principle made it also the factor element in every ancient religion and cu lture, including the Hindu, Chaldean, Babylonian, Persian, Egyptian, Hebrew, and Pythagorean. Thus, the triangle as three represents the triple a spect of Deity, the unmanifested cosmos, and in man , the future evolution of the three higher aspects of spirit. Th e square as four, represents the manifested world o f matter and in man, the product of earth evolution of the ancient four elements of fire, air, water and earth as well as the earth's evolution of the mineral, plant, animal and man kin gdoms of nature. Every man is a quaternary represen ting the earth elements and earth evolution of the four king doms. Man number five, either as a result of his ow n efforts or the future evolution of mankind as a whole, is represen ted with the triangle resting congruent on the top of the square as this is why in our present fifth (Ayran) root race, man is called a pentagon or five pointed star. Thi s represents the goal of our present evolutionary epoch as the incor poration of the fifth principle (Manas) into the lo wer man. In the sixth epoch, the sixth root race will conquer the s ixth principle and after the evolution the seventh root race, mankind having the higher triad inside him will be symbolized as, with the triangle wholly inside the square. 2. CUBE UNFOLDED The most ancient symbol for the septenary in man is the Tau cross or T. It was formed from the figure of 7 affixed to the Greek letter (Gamma) as a double glyph. The let ter gamma is the symbol of earth life or Gaia and t he figure 7 is the symbol of the divine life taught by Pythagoras as the perfect divine number known as Telesphoros. Together as a double glyph, they represent earth life and divine life linked together eternally. In addition, the ho rizontal line represents the Female or matter and the vertical li ne the Male or spirit. The Egyptians added to the prefect Tau a mundane ci rcle (above) as an attribute of Isis which has come to be known as Ankh (life) or ansated cross as their symbol of eternal life. The Madam H.P.B. relates that the Ankh cross symbol is another form of Venus as Isis as . It rep resented esoterically that mid-point in the third root race when the separation of the sexes occurred, when hum an procreation descended from androgynous Adam and separated into man and woman and procreation of the species throug h sexual union. Thus, the first \"fall\" is mankind and all animal life dropping out of the divine spiritu al circle and fallen into male and female generation. Symbolically, the divine becomes , then and finally . However, the Ankh cross of the Egyptians has a much deeper symbolic meaning. We saw before that the fo rth Sephiroth HESED represented the Sephiroth of constr uction as the six dimensions of matter creating the manifested cosmos. It was symbolized by a six-sided cube with the Hebraic script valve of 72. Also, the lower qua ternary of man, the first four principles, is represented as s quare or three dimensional as a cube. This cube of earth-man unfolded represents a very esoteric septenary symbo l as union of the three and four. J. Ralston Skinne r in The Source of Measures states, \"If it is desired to display the process of the est ablishment of the co-ordinating unit of measure spo ken of, by way of symbol, it would be by the figure of the cube unfol ded, in connection with the circle, whose measure i s taken off onto the edges of the cube. The cube unfolded becom es, in superficial display, a cross proper, or of t he tau form, and the attachment of the circle to this last gives the ansated cross of the Egyptians, with its obvious m eaning of the origin of measures.\" \"It is very observable that, while there are but 6 faces to a cube, the representation of the cross as the cube unfolded, as to the cross-bars, displays one face of the cube as common to two bars, counted as belonging to eit her; then, while the faces originally represented are but, the use o f the two bars counts the square as 4 for the uprig ht and 3 for the cross-bar, making 7 in all. Here we have the famous 4 and 3 and 7.\" Thus, on one level and with one key, Skinner shows that the cube unfolded represents the septenary pri nciple in man, the three and four united in a symbol of seven . The Egyptians made the Ankh cross their symbol of man, generation and life and buried their dead with it. But how old is this symbol? Skinner further states that the Aku-aku Cyclopean statues on Easter Isle in the mid-Pacific bear this symbol carved in stone. These islands ar e the remanent tops of mountain ranges on the ancient submerged co ntinent of Lemuria, the home of the third root race . Madame H.P.B. was right when she said the ansated cross wa s a third root race symbol, millions of years old."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" On another level, using the Hebraic script numbers as a key, Skinner discovered another occult corresp ondence with the cube unfolded. In Hebrew, one of the word forms for man is ATSH and adding the value of the letter s (300 +l0 +l) is 311 or reading from right to left in Hebrew is 113. The Hebrew word for lunar year or SHANAH (5 0 +5 +300) or 355. As shown in Plat No. , the cube unfolded is an astronomical symbol of the macrocosm and with t he circle attached to the tau cross as the head of a man \"cir cling the square\", it is a symbol of the microcosm or man. The ratio of 113 to 355 is an ancient value for the rat io of the diameter to the circle or (3.1415). Thus, the cube unfolded is also an ancient symbol o f the primary mathematical relationship of and as S kinner says, an origin of measures reflected in number form in t he cross. This Hebrew word for man represented as 1 13 was probably the \"primordial word\" of the Hebrew script . By welding man to the tau cross we also have the co ncept of the crucifixion in the microcosm and \"man crucified in space\" in the macrocosm. Skinner says, \"In fact, the Old Testament is rabbinically and kab balistically familiar with the expression of crucif ying a man, or men, before the Lord and the sun. In symbol, the na ils of the cross have the shape of the heads thereo f a solid pyramid, and a tapering square obeliscal shaft, or phallic emblem, for the nail. Taking the position o f the three nails in the man's extremities, and on the cross they for m or mark a triangle in shape, one nail being at ea ch corner of the triangle. The wounds, or stigmata, in the extremiti es are necessarily four, designative of the square; there have been two used as one, or rather one used as tow, in the connection of the three nails with the four extremi ties. The three nails with the three wounds are in number 6, which denotes the 6 faces of the cube unfolded, on which the man is placed; and this in turn points to the circular mea sure transferred onto the edges of the cube. The on e wound of the feet separates into two when the feet are separated , making three together for all, and four when sepa rated, or 7 in all-another and most holy feminine base number. In the macrocosm, Plato adopted the decussate cross in space (the X) as the second god who impressed h imself on the universe in the form of the cross and astronomi cally this is represented in the Southern Cross Con stellation. In the microcosm, the fact of Christ crucified on t he cross is an ancient idea acted out in the myster ies of initiation for thousands of years prior to the birth of Christ ."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" The first part of the mystery lay in the coffin. R. Steiner described the candidate for admission bein g placed in a coffin for three days and nights, during which time his atral body and ego traveled with his master on the astral plane. Upon being \"raised\" from the coffin, the can didate, after experiencing the spirit world, become s a fully initiated adept. The druids used subterranean caves or temple crypts in lieu of the coffin. The coffin ritual is still preserved in the third degree of a master mason whi ch still occurs thousands of times a year to this d ay. Even in black magic this ritual is preserved where the Hait ian voo-doo priest drugs his candidate and places h im in a coffin for three days, after which he is raised as a zombi e slave. Whether placed in an underground crypt or coffin, the symbolism is in all ancient mysteries the same. The three days in the coffin for the candidate is corr espondent to the three days Christ spent in the crypt after his cruc ifixion, both the candidate and Christ are raised o r resurrected to a new spiritual life. The second part of the mystery lies in the crucifix ion on the cross as the tree of life. In the Egypti an mysteries, the initiation took place in the kings chamber of the G reat Pyramid of Cheops. This room is built entirely of granite, well finished and finely jointed. Positional close to the west wall is a large rectangular granite san eophagus so impressive that the original British surveyors Vyse and Penning remarked (1837) that, \"the kings chamb ers is the principle apartment, and the security of the sarcop hagus within it the great object for which the Grea t Pyramid was erected.\" So true, the other pyramids were for bury ing the dead, the Great Pyramid was for initiation of the living and the coming mystery of Golgatha. The candidate who had passed all his former trials was attached (not nailed) to a wooden cross in the tau shape and afterwards placed in the sarcophagus for the three days during which time his spiritual ego traveled t he spirit land. During the night of the approaching third day, the candidate in the sarcophagus was carried to a galle ry where at dawn, he was raised to the glory of the rising sun (Osiris), addressing the sun spirit with a newborn spiritual life. The mystery of Christ, as the Solar logos, crucifie d on the cross and afterwards his resurrection from three days in the crypt now becomes clear. We know that Plato was initiated in the kings chamber and he is the sourc e of the astronomical cross in space. Likewise, we know Mose s and his master JETHRO were Egyptian initiates and they carried this symbolism into the Hebrew Messianic cy cle so that the passion and death of Christ was \"ac cording to the scriptures\" or more accurately \" according to t he Egyptian mysteries\". Thus, the mystery of the crucifixion dates back to the very establishment of the ancient mysteries whe re in the candidate becomes reborn after his crucifixion on t he tree of life or tau cross. And, so Skinner shows , this mystery is written into the mathematical and geometric symbols of the cube unfolded. 3. INSIDE THE CUBE"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The cube is everywhere the symbol for earth and mat ter. In the Qabbalah we saw the fourth sephiroth He sed represent the six dimensions of matter as a six-sid ed cube. In the Timaeus, Plato described the cube a s the corpuscular element of earth and matter. However, t here is one fundamental problem with the cube as re presentative of the building block of the manifested universe, C omposed of six square faces, it is inherently unsta ble. As B. Fuller says, \"Any polygon with more than thre e sides is unstable. Only the triangle is inherentl y stable. Any polyhedron bounded by polygonal sides with more tha n three sides is unstable. Only polyhedra bounded b y triangular faces are inherently stable.\" This can b e shown in Plat no. 10 . Therefore, the triangular face of the tetrahedron is more stable than the square face of a cube. From the Law of Three, we saw that the tetrahedron is the first subdivision of the universe and also t he first primary structure. This is not inconsistent with the cube a s primary elements of earth-matter, since the cube can be constructed of tetrahedra."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" All polyhedra may be subdivided into comparable tet rahedra. Every cube contains two tetrahedra as show n here and here"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" without the cube edges here . "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"This is accomplished by subscribing on every square fact a diagonal which becomes one of the six edges on the tetrahedra. A cube stabilized by one tetrahedra has each of six square faces inscribed by a diagonal. A cube stabilized by two tetrahedra, has each of six squar e faces inscribed by two diagonals. Obviously, the latter cube with two inscribed tetrahedra is the most stable. B. Fuller called the alternate pair of tetrahedra, \"symmetrically juxtaposed positive and negative \" w hose centers of volume are congruent with one another and congruent with the center volume of the cube. Thus, every cu be can be stabilized with a positive set of six tetra diagona ls and a negative set of six tetra diagonals. It is possible to stack cubes in one column containing only positive tetra and a separate column containing only negative tetr a. In conclusion, we have solved the problem of the un stable cube as representative of earth=matter by in serting into the cube either a positive tetra, a negative tetra or both. Thus, our cube unfolded should be re-drawn to show the alternating pair of tetrahedrons inside it as shown above . Considering the cube as the platonic element of ear th-matter with two tetra inside it, some interestin g correspondences occur. 4.SYNERGETIC CUBE UNFOLDED"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" First, J.R. Skinner's model of the cube unfolded ne eds to be reworked. His mathematical and geometrica l key for the symbolic coordinating unit of measure discussed on the cube unfolded is based upon, \"the figure of the cube unfolded, in connection with the CIRCLE, WHOSE MEAS URE IS TAKEN OFF ONTO THE EDGES OF THE CUBE\". His mistake is using the \"edge length\" of a cube as the primary unit of measure as opposed to using th e \"diagonal length\" of the cube as the primary unit. From the Law of Three, we observed that the tetrahe dron is the primary structural unit of cosmos, and not the cube. Therefore, the edge length of the tetrahedron shoul d also be the primary unit of measure for a coordin ating geometry of cosmos. Otherwise, one must always use a convers ion factor representing the difference between the edge length"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"of the cube edge as the edge length of the tetra. T his is a problem of all modern science which uses t he three- dimensional cube as primary unit of measure. For ex ample, volume should be measured not as cubic volum e but as tetra volume which is three times more efficient. A lso, geometry should not use the 90 degree coordina tion of the cube but should use the 60 degree coordination of t he tetra. The edge length of the tetra is contained in the cu be as the length of the cube face diagonal. Therefo re, in the Skinner model of the cube unfolded, the circle or s phere as head of man, should be measured off the di agonal length of the cube and not the edge length of the cube. Using this new key, synergetic geometry measurement of unity commences with the tetra-edge as prime ve ctor. Unity is not taken from the cube edge, but from one of the two tetra-edge diagonals that structure the cube. MENSURAL UNITY shows the cube structured by the tet ra whose unit vector diameter value is two, an the cube edge lengths value is the square root of two, a dif ference of two - 1.4142 = 0.5858. For example, the conventional XYZ 90 degrees coordi nate volume for a sphere of radius one is 4.1888. T o convert that cube edge length value to a sphere whose diame ter is equal to the diagonal or tetra-edge length w e must multiply by the above mentioned conversion factor o f 1.0606. The result for a sphere volume with at te tra-edge length is 4.4429, a difference of 0.2541 primary un its of measure. Second, lets call the Skinner cube now containing t wo center congruent tetrahedron the \" Synergetic Cu be Unfolded .\" Reflecting back on the Law of Three and the upper h oly triad of the Quabbalah, we saw how the cosmos w as divided into the manifest and un-manifest worlds. T he unmanifest world showed God as trinity in unity in all ancient wisdom-religion systems. God as trinity also relate d to the Law of Three as representative of the thre e forces of active - passive - neutralizing (from Madame HPB an d Gurdjieff) and positive - negative - resulting (f rom B. Fuller). Taking the volume of the tetra as unity as one, the volume of a tetra-edge length cube is three. The c orrespondence follows. Contained within the manifest world as cub e is the unmanifest world of Deity as three in one unity. Contained with the synergetic cube unfolded, is a p ositive tetra representing the positive or active f ace in nature and a negative tetra representing the negative or passi ve force in nature. A cube stabilized by two tetra is not full in volume, since the cube volume is three and two tetr a volume is two. All that remains as space volume i n the stabilized cube is represented by the third force a s neutralizing - resulting and the holy ghost. The active - passive forces act in space and the resultant of their acti ons is reflected in form in the surrounding one thi rd remaining volume of the cube. Thus, the synergetic cube contains within itself th e Law of Three in several forms. First, a cube with no tetra enclosed. Second, a cube with one positive tetra, w hich can be separately stacked. Third, a cube with one negative"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"tetra, which also can be stacked. Fourth, a cube wi th both positive and negative tetra enclosed within the space of the third force. Thus, a total of four variations in th e manifest world. This has great possibilities as a building block or element in the manifest world the cube can exist i ndependently and be stacked as positively charged, or negatively cha rged or as a balanced charge of neutral. We see thi s in the atomic world as independently charged bodies of electrons, protons, and positrons empty cubes as neutrinos an d neutrons and atoms. On the sub-atomic scale our own script c ould be as follows: Empty Cube--------------- Neutrino--------(0) Positive Cube------------- Positron--------(+) Negative Cube------------- Electron-------(-) Synergetic Cube ----------- Atom (Duo-Tet Cube) (2 interpenetrating triangles) Stating that the empty space within the synergetic cube represents the third or neutralizing force of the holy ghost is a sort of leap of faith and further explanation is required. This empty space shall be called (after F uller) the \"complementation domain\". A cube has a tetra-volume of three and two tetrahedrons have a volume of two . But the remaining complementation domain of the holy ghost is not the remainder of one, because the combined t wo tetra share a combined common center with the cube center : shared common space which must be less than two v olume units.

The sphere represents the tri nity: the Father is the center, the Son the surface, and the Holy Spirit the uniformity of the distance from cen ter to surface(the radius);...A certain image of the zodiac and of the whole firmament is imprinted by God in the soul of the earth.\""},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Now that the space or complementation domain of the third force (holy ghost) has been established as o ne and one- half tetra-volumes, what is the action or non-actio n of the third force within this domain? We observed in the Law of Seven the symbolic repres entation of the triangle wholly within the cube as the synthesis of the lower quaternary with the upper triad. This correspondence can be now brought forward in t he concept of the rotation of a triangle in a cube or the holy ghost as wave (spirit) propagation model. Ours is a universe of radiation in harmonic vibrato ry motion. Starting with a primary vibrating unit c alled a photon, the process of emission and movement of these units is called radiation. The space-time ratio of the v ibration is the frequency of the radiation and the speed of the out ward progression of the speed of radiation is the s peed of light. The combination of a vibratory motion and a linear motion perpendicular to the line of vibration resul ts in a path which has the form of a sine curve or wave. B. Fuller has demonstrated that wave propagation model wave propagation action is cyclically generated by a cube with a triangle rotating in it Synergetics. As shown in Plat No. , the triangle formed by conne cting the diagonals of three adjacent faces of the cube is the face of the tetrahedron within the cube. As the triangle rotates in the cube, so that its vertexes move alo ng the edges of the cube, it goes from being congruent with the pos itive tetrahedron to being congruent with the negat ive tetrahedron.

Our empty cube is static and forms a rotational bas e from which the triangles in tetrahedrons can ente r and rotate. As the triangles of the tetrahedron rotate within the cube, the static form of the empty cube oscillates to a swollen dynamic condition, from the potential to the radian t. As the triangle rotates, what was once an empty static space, pulsates into a spherical cube as the edges of the cube become the six wave linear (sine curve) diagon als of the tetrahedron. The electromagnetic sine curve or wave is the six f old path of the photon along the diagonals of the c ube faces. The cube face is surface area and the total available e nergy of a system is related to its surface area, i nvolving the second power of the radius (E=MC). The tetrahedron has the most surface area with the least volume of any sym metrical polyhedra. Positive and negative electromagnetic en ergy is generated as the rotating triangle passes t hrough the common energy centers of the two tetrahedron and de livers the opposite electromagnetic charge from the base of one tetra to the other tetra. This rapid shuttle of the rotating triangle back and forth between oppos itely charged tetra generates electromagnetic energy which is transferr ed to the faces of the cube. In conclusion, within the empty space or complement ation domain of the third force or Holy Ghost (Spir it), there is an abundance of activity. The rotation of the trian gle within the cube with six vector wave moves per cycle, alternately expands from a static cube to a spheric al cube and contracts back to a static tetrahedron, which tetra is alternatively positive and negative, propagating el ectromagnetic waves reflected on the faces of the c ube.

Of the Numbers that the Ancients Consecrated to The ir Gods and Ascribed to the Elements and Planets The PYTHAGOREANS dedicated certain Numbers sacred t o the Elements and heavenly bodies. To the Air and Octonary, to the Fire a Tetragon, to the Earth a Se nary, to the Water a Duodenary number they assigned . Moreover, they ascribed unity to the Sun, because he is the o nly King of the stars, wherein God placed his Taber nacle. They ascribed the same to Jupiter, who was the father an d head of the Gods, as unity is the beginning and p arent of Numbers. Duality is given to the Moon, which is the second l uminary, and figures out the Soul of the World, and is called June, because between her and unity there is the fi rst conjunction and alike concord. It is also given to Saturn and Mars, the two Infortunes with Astrologers. The Number Three agrees with Jupiter, the Sun and V enus, the three fortunes, it is also deputed to Ves ta, Hecate and Diana. This triad is therefore dedicated to this vi rgin, which they say is powerful both in heaven and hell. Four or the Quaternary Number belongs to the Sun wh o by that number constitutes the cardinal points of heaven and the seasons or times of the year, it is also depute d to Cillenius which was the only quadrate God este emed. Five or a Quinary is assigned to Mercury from one p arity and one imparity, as it is manifest from eith er sex, masculine or feminine.

A Senary pertains to Venus and Jupiter, which is ma de up of a triad led by a dyad, which number Pythag oras is accommodated to generation and marriage. Septenary, a number of rest, belongs to Saturn. The same number concerns the Moon's motion and light. It is assigned to Minerva who hath no generation, also to Pallas that virago, because it consists of numbers as well masculine as feminine. Plutarch gives this number t o Apollo. The Eighth number belongs to Jupiter, sacred to Jus tice and it is dedicated to Vulcan. It is attribute d to Cybele, the Mother of the Gods, to whom every Cube is given. Pl utarch assigned that number to Bacchus or Dionysius , who was born in the eighth month; because others born in th e eighth month died, they constituted that number t o Saturn and the Parcae.

(From ANGEL MAGIC, British Museum) Without narrating a life of Pythagoras, there are t wo important things to remember about him. First Py thagoras was an initiate of all the ancient mysteries. This fact is reflected first hand in The Life of Pythagoras by Iamblichus (B.250 AD). After receiving all the available teach ings of ancient Greece and presumably initiated int o the Eleusinian mysteries and after consulting all the G reek oracles, he travelled to Egypt on the advice o f his teacher, Thales. Here, he was initiated into the mysteries o f Isis at the hands of priests at Memphis and Thebe s. Like his future successor Plato, he was placed on the Tau wo oden cross and raised on the third day from the gra nite sarcophagus in the Kings chamber. Later, he travell ed to Phoenicia and Syria where he was initiated in to all the mysteries of Adonis at Byblos and Tyre. Taken capti ve by the soldiers of Cambyses, he was carried off to Babylon, where he was later initiated by the magi in the Cha ldean lore of astronomy and geometry. Although Iamb lichus does not mention this sojourn, he is said to have travel led through Media and Persia into India where he st udied for several years as a pupil of the Brahmin priests of Elephanta and Ellora. The name of Pythagoras is sti ll preserved in Brahmin records as Yavancharya, the Ionian teacher. Pythagoras was said by all ancient biographers to b e the incarnated son of Apollo and Pythais and Frie nd of Zeus. He certainly taught of the incarnation of the soul, which was exoterically confused with the transmigr ation theory later attributed to him. Fragments from the Doxogra phers say \" He said that the soul is immortal, and that it changes from one body to another; so he was wont to say tha t he himself had been born before the Trojan war as Aethalides, and at the time of the Trojan war as Euphorbus, and after that as Hermontimus of Samos, then as Pyrrho s of Delos, fifth as Pythagoras.\" His father built a temple to Apollo, inscribed to Pythais and his birth was pred icted by the Pythian Oracle. Certainly, Pythagoras was a messeng er from the Gods and his wisdom a synthesis of all then"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"existing mystery schools. We really do not see anot her such an eclectic esoteric person until the life of Apollonius of Tyana, a contemporary of Christ. Second, as a great initiate, Pythagoras was part of the messianic cycle leading to the birth of Christ . R. Steiner has spoken on numerous occasions that the messianic cyc le preparing for the birth of Christ was more than the scripture of the Jewish-Hebrew tradition dating from Moses an d the Exodus. In fact, all the ancient mystery scho ols contributed through their mystery wisdom and rites of initiation to the birth, life and death of Chris t as Golgatha. A glimpse of this secret knowledge was discussed supr a when it was related how the Egyptian initiation i n the King's chamber enacted the drama of Christ as nailed to th e Tau cross, death in the crypt for three days and resurrection to a new spiritual life. Another glimpse of this secret key known to ancient mystery wisdom has been revealed by Steiner in a s eries of lectures on the birth of the Christ child as follow s. About 100 years prior to the birth of the Christ ch ild, an incarnation of the Gautama Buddha was born in the Holy Land named Jesus Ben (son of) Pandira. He became th e founder of the Essence religions sect, which late r taught the Christ child after he left the temple at age twelve . His purpose was to prepare the world for the birt h of Christ. He had a pupil named Matthew whose name passed over to other pupils and the Matthew Synoptic gospel was w ritten in the form of rituals taken from the ancient myste ries by the first Matthew. (This is why the Matthew gospel was first written in Hebrew and not Greek as translated by St. Jerome.) The good Madame H.P.B. confirms this historical eve nt in her paper entitled, The Esoteric Character of the Gospels, referring to the Rabbinical tradition in the Babylo nian Gemera called Sepher Toldus Jeshu about Jesus being the son of one named Pandira, and having lived a century ea rlier than the Christian era, namely, during the re ign of the Jewish King Alexander Jannaeus and his wife Salome who reigned from 106 to 79 B.C. \"accused by the Jew s of having stolen from the Holy of Holies the Incommuni cable name, Jehoshua (Greek for Jesus) was put to d eath by the Sanhedrin at Lud. He was stoned and then crucif ied on a tree, on the eve of Passover. The narrativ e is ascribed to the Talmudistic authors.\" In the Bible, Jesus descended from the House of Dav id. However, two Jesus children were born, one from the Solomon line of the House of David and one from the Nathan line of the House of David. The individuali ty who was the Solomon Jesus child was an incarnation of Zarat hustra; the founder of the cultural epoch of Persia and the mystery school of the Magi. At age twelve, through on occult process, the individuality of Zarathustra forsook the body of the Solomon Jesus child and went over to th e etheric body of the Nathan Jesus child. The body of the Nathan Jesus child was prepared by and contained th e astral body of the Gautama Buddha. After leaving the temple at age twelve, the now Jesus of Nazareth child, bea ring the etheric body of Zarathustra and the astral body of Buddha, wandered the near east visiting the sites o f the ancient mysteries, including the Mithras cult . I say the now Jesus of Nazareth because after age twelve, the mot her of the Nathan Jesus boy died and the father of the Solomon Jesus boy died. The surviving spouses married and t he brothers and sisters of the Solomon child became part of his family, now living in Nazareth. Later, Jesus of Nazareth spent many years with the Essene sect, where he met John the Baptist. At the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan, the ego of Christ as solar log os descended upon him completing the four bodies of his lower quaternary. Knowing the Zarathustra connection in the Messianic cycle, the Pythagoran connection can be explained. Porphyry (b.233 A.D.) the Greek neoplatonic philosopher in w riting an the life of Pythagoras says that, \"In Bab ylon he associated himself with the other Chaldeans, especi ally attaching himself to Zaratus (Zarathustra), by whom he was purified from the pollution of his past life...and here, Pythagoras acquired the greater part of his w isdom.\" The name Zarathustra as well as the names of other ancient s avants like Mani, Manu, Hermes, Rishi, etc. once st ood for an original person, but in the mystery tradition, the students take the name of the teacher, so that afte r several generations, the name becomes generic representing an esoteric stream of knowledge. This is why modern scholars can never exactly date the life and death of the gr eat adepts. Steiner says that Zarathustra incarnated as Zaratus (as per Porphyry) or Nazarathes, the teacher of Py thagoras in Babylon. Here, in Babylon, Pythagoras became initia ted in the Messianic cycle as did the Jews of the B abylonian captivity. In subsequent incarnations, Pythagoras w as reborn as one of the three Magi who visited the crib of Jesus in Bethlehem and later became a disciple of Jesus o f Nazareth. The good Madame H.P.B. also confirms the Zarathustr a connection in the Messianic cycle. The first thre e chapters of Vol II, ISIS UNVEILED is dedicated to the propos ition that the appellation of Jesus of Nazareth was so called not because he came from his father's residence at Naza reth but because Jesus was an initiated member of t he esoteric mystery sect called the NAZARIA, the healers. To support this theory, she states that the Nazirea te sect existed long before the Laws of Moses and o riginated among peoples most inimical to the \"chosen\" ones of Israel, the people of Galilee, where was built a c ity called"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Nazara, the present Masra. Here, and in the caves o f Bethlehem, the Nazra held their sacred mystery ri tes of initiation. In fact, history shows the first Christ ian sects to be either the Ebionites or the Essenes , the later being Therapeutae healers, of which the Nazarenes were a dissenting branch which included John the Baptist a nd his followers. The Madame says that the Nazara of Galilee were fir st Pythagoreans and after conversion to the Buddhis t monastic life, became the sect known as Essenes. The word \"N azar\" means to vow or consecrate oneself to the ser vice of God. As a noun it was an emblem of such dedication, and for this reason Joseph, Ezra, Sampson and Samu el were called Nazars. She concludes that the Zar-adas of t he Pythagorean biographer Porphyry was the head or Nazar of the Babylonian mystery school in which Pythagoras was i nitiated. She, like Steiner, recognizes that the wo rd Zoroaster becomes a generic term since the followers of the o riginal Zoroaster called themselves as disciples by the same name. Thus, some historians refer to Pythagoras Babylonia n teacher as Nazarathus (by Clement of Alexandria) or Zaratus or Zaradas or Narazad. These are but changes of idi oms for different cultures. The key is that they ar e all derivatives of the word Nazar which establishes a direct link w ith Pythagoras, his teacher Zarathustra at Babylon and the Essene sect which instructed Jesus prior to his leaving th is sect with John the Baptist. In addition, other clues emerge with the Nazarene c onnection with Christ. For example, the Nazarene pr iests and initiates were circumcised. All sect members were b aptized in the Jordan River and before and after ba ptism, they had to fast. The gospels tell us that Jesus fasted for forty days after his baptism in the Jordan by J ohn. The Nazarenes wore their hair long, like Sampson and Elijah, the prophet. Both John the Baptist and Jesus are descri bed in the gospels as wearing very long hair. Lastly, Jesus is described as wearing a log white garment without a ny seams. This is the same description given by Josephus of Nazare ne priests and the Buddhist Essenes. In conclusion, Pythagoras, the great initiate, carr ied forth his occult wisdom, hand in hand with Zara thustra, in the ancient mysteries preparation of the Messianic cycl e. 2. THE TETRACTYS and the SQUARE of FOUR By way of introduction, the symbol of \"The tetrakty s and the square of Four\" is best described by Rene Guenon in his 1937 published article of the same name which i s set forth entirely because so instructive and not a wasted word. \" We have often had occasion to allude to the Pytha gorean tetractys with its numerical formula 1+2+3+4 +10, showing the relationship that unites the number 10 directly with the number 4. the quite exceptional i mportance which the Pythagoreans attached to the Tetraktys is well known and it can be measured especially by th e fact that they swore by the \"holy tetraktys.\" It is no doubt less well known that they also had a nother formula for their oaths, namely, \"by the squ are of four\"; between the two formulas there is an obvious relati onship; for the number 4 is their common base. This implies, among other things, that the Pythagorean doctrine h ad to be put forward in a mode that was more \"cosmo logical than purely metaphysical\", nor is that an exception al case when Western traditions are concerned, for we have already had cause to make an analogous remark about Hermetism. The reason for this deduction, which ma y seem strange at first to those who are unaccustomed to t he use of numerical symbolism, is that the quaterna ry is always and everywhere considered as the number of universa l manifestation. In this respect, it therefore mark s the very starting point of cosmology, while the numbers that precede it, 1.2 and 3, are strictly related to ont ology. The particular emphasis on the quaternary ipso facto co rresponds to the cosmological perspective itself."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"At the beginning of the Rasa il Ikhwan as-Safa, the four terms of the fundamental quaternary are enume rated as follows: 1-the principle, which is designated as al -Bari, the creator(which indicates that it is not t he supreme principle, but only being, inasmuch as it is the fi rst principle of manifestation which is, in fact, m etaphysical Unity); 2-the universal Spirit; 3-the universal soul; and 4 -the primordial Hyle. We will not develop just now the different points of view from which these terms can be unders tood; they could be said, for example, to correspon d to the four worlds of the Hebrew Kabbala, which also have their exact equivalents in Islamic esoterism. What conce rns us for the moment is that the quaternary thus constituted is held to be presupposed by manifestation, in the sense that the presence of all its terms is necessary for complete development of the possibilities which manifestati on comprises; and this moreover is said to be why, in the order o f manifested things, the mark of the quaternary, we might say its \"signature\", is always especially noticeably-whence , for example, the 4 elements (ether is not being c ounted here, for it is a question only of the differentiated ele ments), the four cardinal points (or the 4 regions of space which correspond to them, with the 4 pillars of the world ), the 4 phases into which each cycle is naturally divided (the ages of human life, the seasons in the yearly cycle, the lunar phases in the monthly cycle, etc.) and so on . Any number of applications of the quaternary are there, all inter connected moreover by rigorous analogical correspon dances, for basically they are just so many more or less specia lized aspects of one same general schema of manifes tation. This schema, in its geometric form, is one of the m ost widespread symbols, one of those which are trul y common to all traditions: it is the circle divided into 4 equ al parts by a cross formed from 2 diameters at righ t angles; and it can be noted at once that this figure expresses precise ly the relationship between the quaternary and the denary, as does the numerical formula we recalled at the beginning. In fact the quaternary is represented geometricall y in its static aspect by the square, but in its dynamic aspect, as here, by the cross; and the cross, when it turns a round its own center, engenders the circumference which, with the center, represents the denary which itself is the complete numerical cycle. This is what is called the \"circli ng of the square\", the geometric representation of which is represented arithmetically by the formula 1+2+3+4=1 0. Inversly, the Hermetic problem of squaring the c ircle (an expression so often misunderstood) is nothing other what is represented by the fourfold division of th e circle implicit from the two diameters at right angles. This will b e expressed numerically by the same formula, but wr itten inversely: 10=1+2+3+4, to show that all the develop ment of manifestation is thus brought back to the f undamental quaternary. Let us now return to the relationship between the T etraktys and the square of 4: the numbers 10 and 16 have the same rank, namely the fourth, in the two series of triangular numbers and square numbers respectively. The triangular numbers, of course, are those numbers ob tained by adding the consecutive whole numbers from unity to each of the successive terms of the series. Unity i tself is the first triangular number, as it is also the first square number; for being the principle and the origin of t he series of whole numbers it must also be the prin ciple and orgin of all the other series that are derived from it. T he second triangular number is 1+2=3, which shows, moreover, that once unity has produced the binary by its own polar isation, the immediate result is the ternary; and t he geometric representation of this is obvious: 1 corresponds to the summit of the triangle; 2 to the extremities o f the base, and the triangle itself taken as a whole is naturally the f igure of the number 3. If we then consider the thre e terms of the ternary as having an independent existence, this su m gives the third triangular number: 1+2+3=6. This senary number, being the double of the ternary, can be sai d to imply a new ternary which is a reflection of t he first, as in the well known symbol of the \"seal of Solomon\". Continu ing the series, the fourth triangular number is: 1+ 2+3+4=10, namely the Tetrakys; and one sees by this, that the quaternary in a sense contains all the numbers bec ause it contains the denary-whence the formula of the TOA-TE-KING, o ne has produced two, two has produced three and thr ee has produced all the numbers, which amount to saying on ce again that all manifestation is as it were envel oped within the quaternary, or inversly, that the quaternary co nstitutes the whole basis of manifestation's integr al development. The Tetraktys, as a triangular number, was naturall y represented by a symbol which, taken as a whole, was of ternary form, each of its outer sides comprising 4 elements; and this symbol was comprised of 10 eleme nts in all, represented by as many points, of which 9 were the perimeter of the triangle and one at its center. It will be noted that in this disposition, despite the difference of geometric forms, we have the equivalent of the alr eady explained representation of the denary by the circle, as ther e also 1 corresponds to the center and 9 to the cir cumference. In this connection, that it is because 9 and not 10 is the number of the circumference, that its division is n ormally calculated in multiples of 9 (90 degrees for the quadrant and subsequently 360 degrees for the entire circumferen ce) which is moreover directly related to the whole question of cyclic numbers. The square of four is, geometrically, a square of w hich the sides contain 4 elements, like those of th e already mentioned triangle. If we consider the sides themse lves, as measured by the number of these elements, the result is that the sides of the triangle and those of the squ are will be equal. These 2 figures can be united by making the base of the triangle and the upper side of the square co incide as in the figure below and the whole thus ob tained gives rise to the several other considerations that are likewi se not without importance. first, if we consider on ly the triangle"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"and square as such, this combination is a geometric al figure of the septenary as this is the sum of th e ternary and the quaternary: 3+4=7. More precisly, and according to the actual arrangement of the figure, this septenar y is formed from the union of an upper ternary and lower quater nary, which lends itself to various applications. I n the correspondence of triangular and square numbers, th e first must be related to a higher domain than the second, from which it can be inferred that in Pythagorean symbol ism the Tetraktys must have had a function higher t han that of the square of four; and in fact, all that is known of that symbolism would seem to indicate that this was indeed the case. There is a point which is somewhat stranger and whi ch, though it refers to a different traditional for m certainly cannot be considered as a mere coincidence. The two numbers 10 and 16, contained respectively in the t riangle and square, have 26 as their sum; and this number is th e total numerical value of the letters forming the Hebrew Tetragrammaton, yodh, he, vau, he. (we will see thi s later) This division of the Tetraktys is perfectl y normal and the correspondance of the two parts is again very signi ficant; the Tetraktys is thus identified with the Y ODH in the triangle while the rest of the tetragrammaton is in scribed in the square placed beneath it. On the other hand, the triangle and the square both contain four lines made up of points; and if only to call attention to the concordances of the different traditional sc iences, that 4 lines made up of points are to be fo und in the diagrams of geomancy diagrams which by the quaterna ry combination of 1 and 2 are of the number of 16=4squared.; and geomancy, as the name indicates, stands in a special relationship to the earth which , according to the far Eastern tradition, is symbolized by the squ are. Finally, if we consider the solid forms in three di mensional geometry that correspond to the plane fig ures in question here, the cube corresponds to the square, and the f igure that corresponds to the triangle is the quadr angular pyramid with the upper face of the cube as its base. The wh ole forms what Masonic symbolism designates as the \"pointed cubic stone\" and which in the Hermetic tradition is considered to be a figure of the Philosopher's sto ne.\" That being said by the snerdly master of traditiona l symbolism, I would only add that the 3-dimensiona l form of the triangle is the tetrahedron, not the pyramid and as Dr. Steiner recommends, when I say the 7 petitions of the Lord's Prayer, I visualize the seven sides of the above sy mbol as said supra about the 7 principles of man re presented geometrically as our figure of the septenary. 3. MORE SYMBOLISM"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Before studying more of the most ancient symbol of the Decad ,one must take the Pythagorean oath, \"By that pure, holy, four lettered name on high, nature's eternal fountain and supply, the parent of all souls that living be, by him, with faith find oath, I swear to thee.\" The first four numbers arranged in a triangle of te n points is the sacred tetractys . The word is derived from \"tetras\" or four and also represents the quaternary. The first quaternary is one of dimension and number related to form. The dot is the form of the number one. The line is the form of the number two. The plane is the for m of the number three and the solid tetrahedron the form of the number four. The second quaternary is that of music, the symphon ic ratios which form the mathematical harmony of th e musical scale: 1:2, the octave; 2:3, the perfect fifth; and 3:4, the perfect fourth. The third quaternary is that of the ancient Platoni c elements: one is fire; two is air; three is water and four is earth. The fourth quaternary is that of the Platonic solid s as they relate to the elements: fire is the tetra hedron; air is the octahedron; water is the icosahedron and earth is t he cube.

The importance of the quaternary is obtained by add ition (that is to say 1 + 2 + 3 + 4) is great in mu sic because all the consonances are found in it. But it is not only for this reason that all Pythagoreans hold it in h ighest esteem: it is also because it seems to outline the entire nature of the universe. It is for this reason that the for mula of their oath was: \"I swear by the one who has bestowed the Tetra ktys to the coming generations, source of eternal n ature, into our souls.\" The one who bestowed it was Pythagoras, and it has been said that the Tetraktys appears in deed to have been discovered by him."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The first quaternary is the one of which we've just spoken: it is formed by addition of the first four numbers. The second is formed by multiplication, of even and odd numbers, starting from unity. Of these numbers , unity is the first because, as we have said, it is the princ iple of all the even numbers, the odd numbers and o f all the odd-even numbers, and its essence is simple. Next comes thre e numbers from the odd as well as the even series. They allow for the unification of odd and even because numbers are not only odd or even. For this reason, in mult iplication, two quaternaries are taken, one even, the other odd; th e even in double ratio, the first of the even numbe rs being 2 which comes from unity doubled; the odd in triple ratio, the first of the odd numbers being the number 3 whi ch arise from unity being tripled, so that unity is odd and even simultaneously and belongs to both. The second numb er in the even and double [series] is 2 and in the odd and triple is 3. The third of the order of even numbers is 4, and in the odd series, 9. The fourth among the even numbers is 8, and among the odd numbers, 27. The ratios of the most perfect consonances are foun d in these numbers; even the tone is included. Howe ver unity contains the principle of ratio, of limit and of po int. The second numbers, 2 and 3, have the side rat io, being prime, incomposite numbers, and measured only by the unit, and are consequently linear numbers. The third ter ms, 4 and 9, have the power of the squared surface, being equall y equal (that is to say square numbers). The fourth terms, 8 and 27, have the power of the cubic solid, being equall y equal equally (that is to say, cubic numbers). In this way, by virtue of the numbers from this tetraktys, growth p roceeds from the limit and the point up to the soli d. In fact, after the limit and the point comes the side, then the su rface and finally the solid. It is with these numbe rs that Plate, in the Timaeus, constitutes the [world] soul.* The las t of these seven numbers is equal to the sum of all the preceding, as we have 1+2+3+4+8+9= n. There are then two quaternaries of numbers, one whi ch is made by addition, the other by multiplication ; and these quaternaries encompass the musical, geometric and a rithmetic ratios of which the harmony of the univer se is composed. The third quaternary is that which, following the s ame proportion, embraces the nature of all magnitud es, for the place taken by unity, in the preceding quaternary, is that of the point in this one; and that of the n umbers 2 and 3, having lateral (or linear) power, is here that of t he line, through its double form, straight or circu lar, the straight line corresponding to the even number because it termina tes at two points (the line and circle are given as examples here), and the circular to the odd, because it is c omposed of a single line without terminus. And what, in the preceding quaternary, are the numb ers 4 and 9, having the power of the surface, the t wo types of surface, the planar and the curved, are so (surface ) in this one. Finally, what, in the preceding are the numbers 8 and 27, which have the power of the cube and of which o ne is even and the other odd, is constituted by the solid in this one. There are two kinds of solids, one with a curv ed surface, like the sphere or the cylinder, the ot her with a plane surface, such as the cube and the pyramid. This is the third tetraktys then, the one having the proper ty of constituting any magnitude, through the point, the line, the sur face and the solid. The fourth quaternary is that of the simple bodies, fire, air, water and earth, and it offers the same proportion as the quaternary of numbers. The place occupied by unity in the quaternary of numbers is taken by fire in th is one, air corresponds to the number 2, water to the number 3, earth to the number 4; such is indeed the nature o f the elements according to their fineness or density, in such a w ay that fire is to air as 1 is to 2, to water as 1 is to 3, and to earth as 1 is to 4. The other relationships are also equal ( that is to say, that air is to water as 2 is to 3, and so forth for the others). The fifth quaternary is that of the shapes of simpl e bodies, for the pyramid is the figure of fire, th e octahedron the figure of air, the icosahedron the figure of water and the cube the figure of earth. The sixth is that of the created things, the seed b eing analogous to unity and the point. A growth in length is analogous to the number 2 and the line, and a growt h in width is analogous to the number 3 and to the surface, and finally a growth in thickness is analogous to the n umber 4 and to the solid. The seventh quaternary is that of societies. Man is principle and is thus unity. The family correspond s to the number 2, the village to the number 3 and the city to the number 4; for these are the elements which comprise the nation. All of these quaternaries are material and percepti ble. The eighth contains faculties by which we are able to form judgment on the preceding, and which are it s intellectual part, namely: thought, science, opinion and feeling . And certainly thought, in its essence, must be as similated to unity; science is the number 2, because it is the science of all things; opinion is like the number 3, becaus e it is something between science and ignorance; and finally feeling is like the number 4 because it is quadruple, the s ense of touch being common to all, all the senses being motivated through contact. The ninth quaternary is that which composes the liv ing things, body and soul, the soul having three pa rts, the rational, the emotional and the willful; the fourth part is the body in which the soul resides The tenth quaternary is that of the of the seasons of the year, through the suc-"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"cession of which all things take birth, that is, sp ring, summer, autumn and winter. The eleventh is th at of the ages: childhood, adolescence, maturity and old age. There are thus eleven quaternaries. The first is th at of the numbers which are formed by addition, the second is that of the numbers formed by multiplication, the fourth is that of magnitudes, the fifth is that of simple bodies, the sixth is that of created things, the seventh is that of s ocieties, the eighth is that of the faculties of ju dgment, the ninth is that of the living things, the tenth is that of the seasons, and the eleventh is that of the ages. The y are proportional to one another, since what is unity in the first and t he second quaternary, the point is in the third, fi re is in fourth, the pyramid in the fifth, the seed in the sixth, man in the seventh, thought in the eighth, and so forth w ith the others following the same proportion. Thus the first quaternary is i, 2, 3, 4. The second is unity, the side, the square, the cube. The thir d is the point, the line, the surface, the solid. The fourth is fire, a ir, water, earth. The fifth is the pyramid, the oct ahedron, the icosahedron, the cube. The sixth is the seed, the l ength, the width, the height. The seventh is man, t he family, the village, the city. The eighth is thought, science, opinion, sense. The ninth is the rational, the emot ional and the willful parts of the soul, and the body. The tenth is spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The eleventh is childhood, adolescence, maturity and old age. And the perfect world which results from these quaternaries is geom etrically, harmonically and arithmetically arranged, containin g in power the entire nature of number, every magni tude and every body, whether simple or composite. It is perf ect because everything is part of it, and it is its elf a part of nothing else. This is why the Pythagoreans used the oath whose formula we have reported, and through w hich all things are assimilated to number. I am surprised that the great Madame H.P.B. did not remark on the following correspondence between the tetractys and the following Hindu Yogas, although she did cla im on numerous occasions that Pythagoras learned hi s mysteries in India. The figures for these world age s in years were taken from THE SECRET DOCTRINE. 1 = Kali Yuga = 432,000 2 = Dvapara Yuga = 864,000 3 = Treta Yuga = 1,296,000 4 = Krita Yuga = 1,728,000 10 = Maha Yuga = 4,320,000 So sacred is the quaternary, that every Anthropomor phic name of God is written and pronounced by old n ations with four letters. For the Egyptians, Teut; the Arabs, A lla; the Persians, Sire; the Magi, Orsi; the Mahome tans, Abdi; the Greeks, Teos; the ancient Turks, Esar; the Romans, Deus; the Germans, Gott; and the Tartars, Itga. The good Madame H.P.B. says, \"the Logos is the apex of the Pythagorean triangle. when the triangle is complete it becomes the tetrakyts, or the triangle in the squar e, and is the dual symbol of the four-lettered Tetr agrammaton in the manifested Kosmos, and of its radical triple Ra y in the unmanifested, or its numenon.\" For Pythago ras, the Logos was the point or monad, from whence, in refle cting upon itself, all things are created. As state d by George Oliver in THE PYTHAGOREAN TRIANGLE, \"a point corresponds with the monad, both being ind ivisible; and as the monad is the principle of numb ers, so is the point of lines. A line corresponds with the dual, b oth being considered by transition. A line is lengt h without breadth, extending between two points. A superfice corresponds with the triad, because in addition to the duad, length, it possesses a third property, viz., breadt h; which is effected by setting down three points, two opposite, the third at the juncture of the lines made by the othe r two. A solid or cube represents the tetrad; for i f we make three points in a triangular form, and set a forth over t hem, we have a solid body in the form of a pyramid, which has three dimensions, length, breadth and thickness. In geome try, the tetrad combines within itself all the mate rials of which the world and all things therein are composed viz., the point extended to a line; a line to superficie s; and the superficies or triad converted to a solid or tetrad by the point being placed over it.\" Thus, the Logos of H.P.B. and the point of Pythagor as or even the Monad of Liebnitz evolves through ge ometry, into the three dimensions of the manifest world as reflected in the tetractys symbol. But H.P.B. says that this symbol is dual and also reflects the tetragrammaton. As G. Oliver notes, the quaternary was called tetractys by the Gentiles and the tetragrammaton by the Jews. The Jewish name of God the tetragammaton as Jehovah is composed of four letters. Yod ( J), He (H), Vau (V) and He (H) or JHVH. Its origin is from Exodus when Mose s asked the Lord by what name should He be called i f asked by his brethren of Israel. He responded, \"I am that I am\". Because the Hebrew language does not employ vowels in its written form, the correct pronunciation of the ineffable name of God was lost (the Hiram Abiff Mas onic legend of the lost word) until rediscovered by the Quabbal ists. They gave it the name of Tetragrammaton or th e quaternary"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"and discontinued the prior use of the name of God a s Shem Ha-Meforash, a seventy-two syllable name con sisting of 216 letters.

Its relationship as the dual symbol appeared to be well hidden for cent uries until the publication of Kircher's OEDIPI AEG YPTIACI which has the following tetractys in Hebrew letters set above a mandala entitled, THE CHRIST OF GLORY and as follows: 1.

In plane geometry of two dimensions, t heses three are the three primary plane shapes which will independe ntly fill a surface without leaving any gaps - all space filling. In solid geometry of three dimensions, the hexagon in the center represents a family of 2-3-4-fold sym metry the prime representatives of which are the octahedron, cube and cuboctahedron. Taken in another correspondence, the tetractys repr esents the basic theme of our study dealing with th e Law of Three as representative of Deity and the unmanifest ed planes and the Law of Seven as representative of manifested plane of creation. By connecting with lives the mid dle level points, a sixsided hexagon is revealed th e hidden cube . The three points at the corners form a triangle and represent the symbol of the unmanifested planes. T he six points of the hexagon and seventh center point represent t he seven manifested planes. In the Quabbalah, the three points represent the up per Holy Triad of Kether, Binah and Hochmah, the he ad and shoulders of Adam Kadmon and the Atziluth world, al l as represented by the Hebrew letter SHIN. The lower seven points represent the seven lower se phiroth of the manifest world, the creative Elohim of Genesis, all as represented by a cube, the six sides of whic h are the six days of creation and the seventh (cen tral point) the Sabbath. This is the key of the tetractys. As a whole, both the universe and man is formed and built upon ten, the decad. Every atom, cell, plant, mind and spiritual being i s a complete hierarchy in ten degrees or planes. As a completed whole, everything in cosmos is tenfold, composed of the three as a root and seven in active manifestat ion. The Quabbalist symbolism of the central cube hidden in the tetractys was carried forward to the sevent eenth century symbolism of the Rosicrucians. The first exoteric publication appeared at Altona i n 1785 entitled, \"Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucian s of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries. A.E. Waite has traced the contents of this extraordinary volume b ack to Frankfurt in 1678 and an original edition in 1625 p ublished in German and translated into Latin. P. Ma nley Hall in the Secret Teachings reviews the Georgius Van Weldi ng volume of Fifteen Rosicrucian Diagrams published in 1735 and Hall states the correspondence of the cube as s ymbol of salt and matter: \"The cube has six sides, corresponding to the six d ays of creation, with the point of rest (the sevent h day) in the center of the cube, on each surface of the cube app ears the signs of the four elements (as triangles). The cube is composed of twelve bodies, each of which has six si des. These bodies are the twelve fundamental pillar s of the true invisible church, and when multiplied by the six si des of the cube, the magical number 72 results. The cube also consists of six pyramids with the six surfaces of t he cube as their bases. The point of these six pyra mids meet at the center of the cube. These six pyramids, each consis ting of four triangles, signify the elements, and p roduce the magical number 24, which is the Elders before the T hrone. The six surfaces and the central point const itute the magical number 7. If 7 is multiplied by 7 over 7 ti mes, the method used by the ancients for measuring the periods of eternity; (not in earth years) 49 = 7 X 7 343 = 7 X 49 2,401 = 7 X 343 16,807 = 7 X 2,401 117,649 = 7 X 16,807"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"823,543 = 7 X 117,649 5,764,801 = 7 X 823,543 The 5,000,000 equals the great Hall year; the 700,0 00 equals the great Sabbath year, wherein all human beings gradually gain true understanding and became heirs to the original and eternal inheritance, which was lost when they were enmeshed in the lower elements. The 64,800 is the number of fallen angels and the last year is th e liberation of Lucifer and return to his original estate\". Another Rosicrucian diagram from this selection sho ws the cube as the New Jerusalem with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel written on the twelve lines of the cube, and in the center is the eye of God. A correspondence that bears more scrutiny is the ti me period calculation shown previously between the Hindu cosmic cycle of the four Yugas and the ancients (la ter Rosicrucian) periods of eternity as a permutati on of cycles of them. 4.ROSICRUCIAN WORLD AGES The identity of the hidden central cube which when taken with the central seventh point shows how the law of seven operates within the symbol of the whole decad or te tractys. Following the correspondence of the \"perio ds of eternity\" of the ancients and the seventeenth centu ry Rosicrucians, it is interesting to see how the n ineteenth century Rosicrucians have extended this occult permutation of 7 x 7. R. Steiner in his series of lectures entitled, \"THE APOCALYPSE OF ST. JOHN\" speaks of the world ages a s an \"outer scaffolding\" that has to be taken down when the building is complete. These lectures were given in 1908 while he was the head of the Theosophical Society i n Germany but, for lack of a better term, I will ca ll them the Rosicrucian System because of their correspondence with the Seventeenth Century world ages of the fift een Rosicrucian diagrams of Van Welling. He begins with a permutation of 7 as the so-called Post-Atlantean Cultural Epochs 1. Ancient Indian 2. Ancient Persian 3. Assyrian-Babylonian-Egyptian 4. Graeco-Roman 5. Present Cultural 6. Sixth Cultural (Un-named) 7. Seventh Cultural (Un-named) Each of these epochs represent a cultural phase in the evolution of humanity. For example, the ancient Indian epoch arose about the eighth millennium B.C. and its spir itual, intellectual and moral development was guide d by the holy Rishis, through initiation in the mystery schools. The Buddhist and Brahman paths still have a signifi cant spiritual effect on the Hindu culture today. The second cultural epoch arose in the fifth millen nium B.C. with the ancient Persians guided by the t eachings of the great initiate of the Sun oracle, Zarathustra. The third cultural epoch arose about the beginning of the third millennium B.C. This was a time of gre at scientific advances by the Chaldeans in astronomy and the Egyp tians in architecture and socialization of the mass es. The fourth cultural epoch coincides with the Graaeco-Ro man civilization arising in the eighth century B.C. During this time, Christ came into this world in fulfillment of the prophetic vision of the ancient mystery school s and the Jewish prophets. The present Fifth cultural epoch begins in the year 1413 with the European civilization intellectually rising with the Renaissance and leading to our materialistic age of modern science. Each cultural age represents a stage of the soul ev olution of the human ego. At the end of the seventh cultural epoch, Steiner says, will come the great \"war of all again st all\" wherein civilization will be destroyed exce pt for a select few whose destiny is to begin the evolution of the next sixth root race. Steiner next proceeds with a second permutation of 7 as the so-called root-races or evolutionary epoch s. 1. Polarian Race 2. Hyperborean Race 3. Lemurian Race 4. Atlantean Race 5. Aryan Race 6. Sixth Race (Un-named) 7. Seventh Race (Un-named) In the first two root races, we do not see man in t he sense of the physical body we have today. Basica lly, these epochs were the evolutionary stages of an astral pr oto-type which descended and materialized into the first human"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"form during the middle of the third Lemurian Race a t which time, the first \"fall\" of mankind occurred, the division of the sexes into sexual generation. The location o f the Lemurian continent was south of Asia in the I ndian and Pacific oceans and extended from Ceylon to Madagasc ar. The tectonic plates of this long since submerge d continent have caused the uplifting of the Himalayan mountain s. The Remnant survivor sub-races from this civiliz ation destroyed by \"fire\" are to be seen in the Aborigine s of Australia. Each root race has physical and mental characterist ics peculiar to it. The task of the fourth root rac e was to develop human memory and its keystone was communication by speech and language. Each root race also has a perm utation of 7 known as sub-races. The sub-races for the Atla ntean race are: 1. Rmoahals - feelings, personal and ancestral memo ry. 2. Tlavatli - personal ambition. 3. Toltecs - social communal life, kings. 4. Primal Turanians - abuse of power. 5. Primal Semites - logical thinking. 6. Akkadians - social order and laws. 7. Mongols - duty to ancestral memory. The epoch of the Atlantean Race ended about one mil lion years ago by destruction with \"water\" and the subversion of the Atlantis continent in the Atlantic Ocean. We are now in the middle of the fifth or Aryan Root R ace. The next Septenary world age Steiner describes as C onditions of Forms.: \"Before something becomes physical it is astral; be fore it is astral it is at a spiritual stage which is called Lower Devachan; and before anything descends to this stag e it is in a higher stage of devachan. When the ast ral condenses it becomes physical. Then the physical dissolves ag ain and returns to a more perfect astral. This pass es to a more perfect lower devachanic form; and this to a higher devachanic form. The physical condition of form is in the middle.\" This means that our planet Earth is in an intermedi ate physical stage, after condensing from the forme r astral stage and in the future will dissolve and ascend to the m ore perfect astral stage. Thus, the conditions of form through which every ki ngdom passes, 1. higher Devachan 2. lower Devachan 3. Astral 4. Physical (present earth in middle stage) 5. more perfect astral 6. lower Devachan 7. higher Devachan The next Septenary world age is called by Steiner t he Conditions of Life and is represented by the sev en so-called kingdoms of nature. 1. First Elementary Kingdom 2. Second Elementary Kingdom 3. Third Elementary Kingdom 4. Mineral Kingdom (present mankind in middle stage ) 5. Plant Kingdom 6. Animal Kingdom 7. Human Kingdom The elementary kingdoms are those of the gnomes, sy lphs and undines as described by Paracelsus in the 16th Century. Mankind, now, has its consciousness only i n the Fourth mineral kingdom. By this is meant that he can control the forces of nature in this kingdom only. For example, from the mineral kingdom, he can build houses and machines and even synthetic crystals. However, his knowledge has not yet penetrated those same forces to create out of the plant kingdom. Our current progress in DNA g enetics research in producing DNA altered and impla nted microbes is a reflection of this future direction o f evolution. The last Septenary world age is called by Steiner t he seven conditions of Consciousness and this relat es in the microcosm to the septenary bodies of man described in The Law of Seven. There it was shown that the ev olution of man was a progressive control by the ego or fourth body over the unfolding of the three higher princip les in man. For example, to the extent that the ego has worked upon the astral body so as to gain control of the a nimal instincts and passions, one is said to have developed his fif th principle or Manas. Likewise, as the ego control s and transforms the etheric body, one is said to have de veloped his sixth principle or Buddhi. Likewise, eg o control over"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"the physical body develops the seventh principle or Atma. We said before that man now is represented o nly as a pentagon because at this evolutionary state, he has only begun to work on his fifth principal of manas . In the future, at the end of the Vulcan Round he will some day hav e the completed triangle of three higher principles wholly within the quaternary of the four lower principles. Steiner relates this unfolding of the sevenfold nat ure of man on the macrocosmic planetary scale in th e seven Conditions of Consciousness as, MACROCOSM---------------------------------MACROCOSM 1. Old Saturn ------------------------ Physical bod y 2. Old Sun -------------------------Etheric 3. Old Moon ----------------------Astral 4. Earth --(present earth)------------- -------- Eg o (present mankind) 5. Jupiter ----------------------------Manas 6. Venus - ---------------------------Buddhi 7. Vulcan -------------------------- Atma Thus, the physical body of man was developed in a p lanetary stage called - old Saturn, etc. Mankind is presently in the Fourth or Earth State wherein the ego is being developed during the seven cultural epochs as afore said. In conclusion, the periods of eternity described nu merically only by the seventeenth century Rosicruci ans, has been further described by the nineteenth century Rosicru cian Steiner as, 7 Conditions of Consciousness 4 th 7 X 7 Conditions of Life 4 th 7 X 7 X 7 Conditions of Form 4 th 7 X 7 X 7 X 7 Root Races 5 th 7 X 7 X 7 X 7 X 7 Atlantean sub-races 7 X 7 X 7 X 7 X 7 X 7 Cultural epochs 5 th Having briefly discussed the seven planetary condit ions, this throws some light on the symbolism on th e \"twenty- four elders before the Throne\" mentioned in connect ion with the central cube of the 17th Century Rosic rucians. Steiner says that during each planetary condition, certain beings reach their evolutionary potential a nd then pass onto higher celestial hierarchies. For example, during S aturn Round, the Asuras or Archaia, during the Sun Round, archangels and during the Moon Round, the angels, r eached the human or Seventh Condition of Life. Afte rwards, they passed on and have progressed further than man , but they can still look back and remember their e volution. They can look down upon evolving mankind from their spiritual cosmic realm and help guide and regulate man's evolution. Of those beings who have passed on to hi gher realms, seven from the Saturn Round, seven fro m the Sun Round, seven from the Moon round and three from the Earth Round (twenty-four in all) have remained beh ind to help guide the evolution of man. These directors of time are called in Western occultism the twenty-fo ur elders before the Throne, the original historical referenc e coming from the Apocalypse of St. John. It is imp ortant to observe that the number of the Elders (24) is not d erived from the Law of Twelve (12+12), but from the Law of Seven (7+7+7+3) and the central cube of the tetract ys. In Eastern occultism there is a similar doctrin e where in the directors of time are called Lords of Compassion an d the elders are called Dhyani-Buddhas. Lastly, some explanations should be offered as to w here mankind stands in this scheme of world ages at the present time. Each planetary round or Condition of Consciou sness can run its cause only after seven Conditions of Life and each Condition of Life can only run its course afte r seven Conditions of Form. Thus, the entire Earth evolution requires 7x7x7 = 343 Conditions of Form. Since we are now in the fourth Planetary Round or C ondition of Consciousness, then Old Saturn has pass ed through 7 Conditions of Life and 7 Conditions of Form for a total of 7x7 = 49. Likewise, the old-Sun has passe d through 7x7 or 49 Conditions of Form and the moon as passed thr ough 7x7 or 49 conditions for a total of 147 Condit ions of Form (49+49+49). These 147 conditions bring us to the present Fourth Planetary Round of Earth. On Earth, mankind has al ready passed through three Conditions of Life or three ro unds and we are presently living in the Fourth Roun d of the Mineral kingdom. Thus, we add 3x7 or 21 Conditions of Form to the 147. In addition, man has lived thro ugh the first 3 Conditions of Form (the higher and lower De vachan and Astral) leaving four Conditions of Form for future evolution. The total is 7 x 7 = 49 old Saturn 7 x 7 = 49 old Sun 7 x 7 = 49 old Moon 147+ 3 x 7 = 21"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"3 = 3 Total = 171 Conditions of Form Man is presently living in the Fifth Cultural Age ( beginning in 1413) of the Fifth or Aryan Root Race of the 172nd Condition of Form.

HINDU YUGA CYCLE We saw in the Rosicrucian world ages a cosmic cycle as a permutation of seven, which seven is taken fr om the central cube and hidden seventh point residing with in the tetractys. We tracked the source of this sys tem beginning with the Quabbalah, through the Apocalypse of St. J ohn in the New Testament, to 17th Century and final ly 19th Century Rosicrucian symbolism. This is the progress ion of Western occultism. The progression of the Eastern occultism is based u pon the Hindu Yuga cycle of 4-3-2 and not the Rosic rucian cycle of 7 x 7, although the two cycles are related, as w ill be later shown. Both Western and Eastern occult cycles are drawn from the tetryactys. First, as described on page , the Hindu Yuga cycle is most definitely based upon the tetractys with a root number of 432 which is the tetractys ratio in reverse order, with the number 1 or unity dropped, viz: 1-2-3-4 re versed to 4-3-2- (1 dropped). Thus, the numbers of years in a Kali Y uga is 432,000 years and each successive Yuga adds to the tenfoldness of the Maha Yuga of 4,320,000 years. Now, the Hindu Yuga cycle as well as the Chaldean n umerical and astronomical systems stem from the gra nd occult solar precessional cycle called the Great Platonic Year. We shall see this cycle frequently, but a sim ple description follows. The sun travels across the sky on a pathway called the plane of the ecliptic which is also a line that passes through the 12 constellations of the zodiac. The signs of t he zodiac are not equal but approximate divisions o f this great circle, which when divided into twelve equal parts would have equal arcs of 30 degrees. The position t hat the sun occupies at the moment of the solar equinox is call ed the first point of Aries. This point moves each year and in fact moves in a retrograde direction so that there is a lag between two successive coincidences of the spri ng equinox in relation to two successive coincides of the sun wit h the same point in a given constellation (sidereal year). This annual lag is calculated by occultists as about 50 seconds per year which amounts to 1 degree in 72 ye ars (50\" x 72 = 3600\" = 60' = 1) and further to 2,160 years to 30 degrees or one sign of the zodiac and a full zodia c cycle of 12 x 2,160 or 25,920 years. These numbers of 60, 72, 2,1 60 and 25,920 are very occult numbers and will be d ealt with separately, but the important object here is that t hey are derived from the complete solar precessiona l cycle of 25,920 years. The discovery of this solar cycle is attributed to the Greek astronomer Hipparchus in the year 125 B.C . However, this is an exoteric designation given by Western sc ience including the appellation \"great Platonic Yea r\". That it was known to Chaldean astronomers is obvious from the f act that the entire mathematical, geometrical, astr onomical and"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"musical aritmetic of the Babylonians was sexagesion al or based upon the unit of 60. Divide the standar d Babylonian base number of 60 into the solar precessional year and the result is our tetractys base number of 432! This sacred number 432 of the tetractys saturates a ncient Hindu, Babylonian, Chaldean and Egyptian cos mological systems. For example, according to Berossus, the re ign of the ten antediluvian kings in the Babylonian Marduck mythology was 432,000 years and this was called the ir \"great year\". In the Hindu RG VEDA, (the oldest written text) the 10,800 stanzas average forty syllables pe r stanza for a total of 432,000. In the geometry of Ptolemy, the diameter of his great circles in 432,000 and in his musical theory 432,000 is the least common denomin ator of his monochord fractions. The Hindu Yuga for measuring eternity is based upon the Maha Yuga cycle, taken from the tetractys, the 4-3-2 springing from the monad and tenfold powers of the sacred decad. A day of Brahma is equal to 1000 cycl es of the Maha Yuga, the year of Brahma is 360 such days and the life of Brahma lasts for 100 such years. 4,320,000 -------------------- 1 Maha-Yuga--------- - (root race cycle) 308,448,000 -----------------1 Manvantara---------- (minor round) 4,320,000,000 ---------------1 Day of Brahma------ (Kalpa or manvantara) 4,320,000,000 ----------------1 Night of Brahma 8,640,000,000 ---------------1000 Cycles of Maha-Yu ga----(Day and night together) 3,110,400,000,000 ----------1 Year of Brahma or 360 Kalpa's 311,040 x 10------------------1 Life of Brahma of 1 00 Years---(Maha-Kalpa) These figures represent the upper end of the cosmic cycles of the life of Brahma which H.P.B. says is also the life or duration of our solar system. Although the figures given in the Secret Doctrine a re a confused blind, G. dePrucker, on several occas ions, states that \"at the present period, we have lived somewhat more than half of the Maha-Manvantaric cycle\" or 5 0 of the Divine years in the life of Brahma. Thus, there rem ain over 155 trillion, 520 odd billion years in the cosmic cycle of the life or duration of our solar system. To get an idea of the figures for the lower end of the cycle, we can recall the following from Secret Doctrine, \"there are seven rounds in every manvantara; this one is t he fourth and we are in the fifth-root race at pres ent. Each root race has seven sub-races, every sub-race has seven ramifications which may be called Branch or Family races\". Thus this system is exactly similar to the so-calle d Rosicrucian, as, 7 Family Races =---------Sub-Root Race 7 Sub-Races = ----------1 Root Race 7 Root Races = ---------1 Globe Round 7 Globe Rounds = ------1 Planetary Round or Manvant ara 7 Planetary Rounds =-----1 Maha-Manvantara or Kalpa -------------------= ----- 4,320,000,000 years or d ay of Brahma However, Steiner was very careful never to express the Rosicrucian cycles in ages of years. The Madame H.P.B. does give some idea of the length in yars when she says there is, \"comparative approximation of durati on between the lives of a family race and a sidereal year.\" We know the cycle of the occult solar sidereal year i s 25,920 years. Steiner does seem to relate the length of each cult ural epoch (the present fifth one beginning year 14 13) in terms of 2,160 years or one-twelfth of a solar year. Another hint is given by Madame H.P.B. in reference to the Kali Yuga cycle when she says it begins in the year 3102 B.C. and the first 5,000 year cycle ends in 18 98, a year of great significance. As shown on page , a Kali Yuga consists of 432,000 years of which, then, in 1992, 426,906 years remain in the cycle. Also, the Maha-Y uga cycle of 4,320,000 years is frequently referred to as a root race cycle, remembering that at the mid-point of a cycle, a new root race begins. The Madame does state that the revealed cycles in y ears is veiled in a blind for the exoteric populati on. This is why the Brahmin figures published in the Secret Doctrin e are internally inconsistent and unworkable. But p art of the blind may be explained in that area where the two ( Western and Eastern) occult systems coincide. As sa id earlier, the Western system is based upon a 7x7 permutation that does not reveal actual time in earth years, wh ile the Eastern system is based upon a 4-3-2 permutation th at reveals some cycles in actual earth years, as sh own above in the years of the Maha-Yuga Kalpa, and life of Brahm a. But where does the 7x7 and the 4-3-2 coincide? The place to start would be the solar sidereal year or Great Platonic Year of 25,920 years since we ha ve shown that both Eastern and Western occult systems acknowledge that cycle. The Madame's duration for a \"family ra ce\" is about 25,920 years and Steiner's duration for a cul tural epoch is 2,160 years."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Now, the cycle of 2,160 years is called a \"Messiani c cycle\" in Western occultism, and is associated wi th one sign of the zodiac. Thus, the second cultural epoch of the Persians under the sign of Taurus, was commenced wi th the appearance of Zoroaster. Likewise, the third cultur al epoch of the Egyptians under the sign of Aries w as swept in with the appearance of Hermes or Thoth. The fourth cultural epoch of the Greek-Roman civilization bega n about 60 B.C. under the sign of Pisces and historically desi gnated as the fish as Taurus was designated as the bull, etc. In the Talmud of the ancient Jewish priests, the Messiah w as called Dag or Fish, and the Messiah was to come \"in conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the sign of th e fish\" or Pisces. Thus, Christ and early Christian s took the symbol of the fish. Thus, at the commencement of each cycle of 2,160 ye ars, there appeared a new Messiah or spiritual teac her and we expect the next in the dawn of the age of Aquarius. Now, the Messianic cycle (2160) and the Hindu (4320 ) cycle coincide in the two turns of the key as 2 x 2,160 = 4,320, and both cycles are whole fractions of the s olar sidereal cycle of 25,920 years, one-twelfth an d one-sixth, respectively. In conclusion, the Rosicrucian and Hindu-Yuga cycle s correspond as follows: Us Now -------------------Rosicrucian-------------- ---------------- Hindu -----------------------------7 Planetary Conditions ------- = 1 Life of Brahma or Maha-Kalpa 4th (Earth)---------------- Planetary Conditions--- ------- = Maha-Manvantara or Kalph 4th (Mineral) -------------Conditions of Life------ -------- = Planetary Rounds 4th (Physical) -------------Conditions of Form----- ------- = Globes 5th (Aryan) -------------Evolutionary Epoch-------- -------= Root Races 5th (1413) -----------------Cultural Epochs-------- --------= Sub-Races Leaving aside the 7 Planetary Conditions and 7 Roun ds, since we have passed through 3 Conditions of fo rm (Globes) and 4 Root Races and 4 Cultural Epochs, th e current number of our evolution in apocalyptic la nguage is 3- 4-4 and with the birth of Christ during the 4th cul tural epoch, the number of the Messiah is 3-4-3. Wh at is the significance of the number of the beast 6-6-6? 6. THE SYNERGETIC TETRACTYS A. Tetractys Frequency Grid If we have two events, the number of lines connecti ng the events is one. If we have three events, the number of lines connecting the events is three. Likewise, for four events, the number of connecting lines is six and f or five events the number of connecting lines is ten. B. Fuller discov ered the algebraic relationship as R = N(squared) m inus N divided by 2.where R equals the minimum number of relations hips and N equals the number of events. This is dem onstrated in the following grid table . "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" Thus, in a world of random events, each event can b e connected to each other event by a line of commun ication. However, in this random arrangement there is always an underlying order that relates to the Tetractys. Looking at the last column, the sum or total of all close pack ing of the number of relationships is always triang ular in the form of a tectractys! Thus, when we look at the apparent randomness of the stars in the sky, the sum total of their relationships or experiences is always symmetricall y triangular in the close packed form of the tetrac tys. Thus, we can see that nature always close packs its relationships in a triangular form. The same is al so true for three dimensional relationships. Modern science always re fers to X as 'squared' and X as 'cubed', as shown i n Plat No. , regardless of the grid frequency, triangling instea d of squaring is always more economical because a t riangle takes up less space than a square and tetrahedron takes u p two-thirds less volume than a cube. The arithmeti cal results of space and volume are always the same, but the tetra ctys frequency grid is more efficient and economica l. Now, the tetractys frequency grid has some interest ing qualities. First, it represents the underlying triangling of nature. As we showed on page , the only stable poly gons have triangular faces. All polygons are reduci ble to triangles and are not further reducible. All polyhe dra are reducible to triangulation and not further reducible. Second, it utilizes 60 degree coordination which we discussed supra as the most efficient geometry. Th e 90 degree X-Y-Z coordinate system is less economical because it is based upon a square and cube. In addition, in 90 degrees coordination, the lengths of radials are unequal so that the hypotenuse of 90 degree angles do not int egrate with circumference lengths. Whereas, 60 degree coordination operates either cir cumferentially or radially because the angles, leng ths, arcs and chords are of equal length. The prime structural re lationship of all polyhedrons and polygons is with the 60 degree angle. Third, its symmetry is a model of equilibrium. The triangular grid is composed of equal angles which p roduce equal arcs and equal chords. The internal length between each monad or point is equal and the internal lengt hs between different monads is proportionally equal in a harmo nic relationship. If nature abhors an equilibrium a s much as she abhors a vacuum, then the tetractys frequency grid is her model of perfection. B. Isotropic Vector Matrix If each monad or point within the tetractys frequen cy grid is likened to the centers of equal radius s pheres, the geometric result is called by R.B. Fuller, the Isot ropic vector matrix , isotropic meaning everywhere the same and isotropic vector meaning everywhere the same energy conditions."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" This prescribes an everywhere state of equilibrium in close packed spheres. The vector matrix is compo sed of only two polyhedra, the tetrahedron and octahedron, whic h act as all space fillers. The tetractys as drawn by Pythagoras is a two-dimen sional plane geometry frequency grid. The isotropic vector matrix is the three-dimensional solid geometry anal og of the tetractys. The matrix represents an aggre gation of equal sized spheres - close packed, but removing the sphe res and leaving the vectors. This tetrahedron - oct ahedron complex Fuller also calls the \" octet truss \". Each line within the maze represents a vector. It i s four-dimensional and also employs 60 degree coord ination. Every vector leads from one nuclear center to anoth er and represents the operational effect of a mergi ng of any two or more force centers upon each other. Each vector is composed of two halves, each half belonging resp ectively to any two adjacent nuclear centers. Each half of the interconnecting vectors represent the radius of one of the two spheres tangent to one another at the vector mid-po ints. Fuller recognized a most important principle and an inherent property of the isotropic vector matrix. As he says, it \"demonstrates the capability of accommodating all s ymmetrically and asymmetrically terminated, high-fr equency energy vectors of any structural shaping\". In other words, the matrix accommodates within it any polyg on shape. "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" This extraordinary feature is why Pythagoras and hi s followers for 2000 years right down to Madam H.P. B. in the 19th Century, called the tetractys, the measure of all things, for it contains the structuring of all shapes in the universe. Again, the occult secret wisdom recognize d in the tetractys, its analog solid geometry form of the isotropic vector matrix. See Plat No. . To demonstrate this principle extended through init ial frequencies, look at this first and second freq uency grid . "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" The first frequency of the tetractys is the point o r monad. In the I.V. Matrix, the first frequency is a point extended into a sphere. Remove the sphere and leave the vect or lines and a tetrahedron results. The second frequency matrix shows a tetrahedron wit h the mid-points of the six edges connected to form an octahedron. Taking this a step further, joining and interconnecting the midpoints of the octahedron ed ges results in the cuboctahedron. Thus, we have a progression of s ymmetrical polygons from two frequency tetrahedron to octahedron to cuboctahedron. One could have as easi ly inscribed a two frequency cube as well as shown in the plat. Now look at the three frequency matrix which inscri bes a truncated tetrahedron. This is a unique polyg on with seven independent axis of rotational symmetry, unknown to the ancient Greeks and discovered by Keith Critchl ow. The four frequency matrix grid discloses a number o f symmetrical polygons. The first subdivision discl oses the familiar octahedron, and as Plat No. shows inscribe d within this two frequency octahedron is an icosah edron. We can also see the familiar two frequency cube and at the center of the grid, the nuclear cuboctahedron."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"A summary of the three subdivision, four frequency grid is shown as Plat No. , prepared by Keith Critc hlow, inscribing the nuclear octahedron, nuclear truncate d tetrahedron, and finally the nuclear cuboctahedro n. As we proceed to five, six and seventh, etc. freque ncy matrix grids, other symmetrical and asymmetrica l polygons appear both in their original shape and in their tr uncated shape. For example, Plat No. , shows the tr uncated tetrahedron within the five frequency grid, that we saw also in the three frequency grid. This demonst rates another important principle that the same polygons appear a nd re-appear in successive grids in larger and smal ler scales of size. Any polygon whose faces are shaped with triangles, squares and hexagons progressively appear in an inf inite series of subdivisions of the original monad or tetrahedro n. What the good Madame H.P.B. observed about the t etractys is equally true for its three-dimensional form of the isotropic vector matrix. \"The ten points inscribed within that 'Pythagorean triangle' are worth all the theogonies and angelolo gies ever emanated from the theological brain. For he who int erprets them - on their very face, and in the order given - will find in these seventeen points (the seven Mathemati cal Points hidden) the uninterrupted series of the genealogies from the first Heavenly to terrestrial man. And, as they give the order of Beings, so they reveal the order in which were evolved the Kosmos, our earth, and the primord ial elements by which the latter was generated. Beg otten in the invisible Depths, and in the womb of the same \"Moth er\" as its fellow-globes - he who will master the m ysteries of our Earth, will have mastered those of all others.\" Another remarkable quality of the isotropic vector matrix corresponds to the most ancient Hermetic max im of \"as above, so below\". This expression taken from the Em erald Tablet of Hermes as follows. \"True, without error, certain most true; that which is above is as that which is below, and that which is below is as that which is above, for performing the marvels of the Kosmos. As all things are from the one, so all things arose out of this one thing by evolving...\" The one or one thing is of course the first point o r monad of the tetractys, from which all things ema nate, in the order of the duad, triad and quaternary. The \"as ab ove, so below\" occult maxim should be re-named the \"isotropic maxim\" for when we look at the isotropic vector mat rix, the way up is also the way down. For example, looking at the two frequency matrix, on the one hand it can be described as a second power or doubling of a singl e tetrahedron with each edge length being twice the original tetr a edge length. On the other hand, it can equally be described as a second power subdivision of the tetrahedron, with e ach midpoint of the edge length being one-half of t he original tetra edge length. The result is equally or isotopi cally the same. The form or structure of the matrix remains constant in a harmonic relationship of 2:1/2, 3:1/3, 4:1/4, etc, whether the powering is expanding or subdividi ng. The ancient wisdom surely recognized this isotropic principle. C. Cube Quanta Modules The synergetic geometry of B. Fuller may help to ex plain the mystery of one of our occult numbers - th e 72 and its relationship with the cube. We discussed previously the fourth Sephiroth of the Quabbalah named Hesed which represented the manife sted world emanating from the upper holy triad. These si x dimensions of the manifested cosmos are represent ed as the six sided cube with a Hebraic script value of 72. T his was the first most ancient occult correspondenc e between the cube and the number 72, as recognized by the Chalde an and Hebrew Quabbalah. A second correspondence was recognized again by the Hebrew Quabbalists in the seventy-two syllable nam e of God before the Lost Word. After the ineffable name of G od was rediscovered, it was given the four letter n ame as represented in the tetragrammaton. But as Kircher d iscovered, the Hebraic script valve of JHVH when la yed out in the tetractys matrix still had a correspondence val ve of seventy-two. Also, the seventy-two angels of Jacob's ladder. A third correspondence was recognized by the 17th C entury Rosicrucians in the hidden central cube with in the tetractys also representing the manifest cosmos. In addition, the cube consisted of twelve bodies, eac h of which has six sides, or again, the occult number 72. A fourth correspondence was recognized in the solar sidereal year cycle. The base term of which was a retrograde motion of one degree in seventy-two years which is also the biblical length of the live of a man at th ree score plus ten years (exoteric). In conclusion, the six sided cube has always been i dentified with the Platonic element of Earth, Matte r and the manifested cosmos. Although the cube is geometrical ly six (sides), it corresponds to the Law of Seven because of the hidden seventh point in the center. The mystery lies in the correspondence by the ancient wisdom o f the cube with the number seventy-two. Fuller can shed some light on this mystery. In the isotropic vector matrix, there are two primary omni symmetrical polyhedra described by the configuration of the int eracting vector lines. "},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" These two are the regular tetrahedron and the regul ar octahedron. All other symmetric and asymmetric p olyhedra (other than the icosahedron and pentagonal dodecahe dron) are described by repetitiously compounding ra tional fractional elements of the tetrahedron and octahedr on. These fractional elements or subdivisions of th e tetra and octahedron are called by Fuller, the A and B Quanta Modules. Before Fuller created his modules, a man named Schl afli in 1901 discovered that a polyhedron can be su bdivided or built up (the isotropic maxium says it is both) int o one or more kinds of oppositely congruent tetrahe dous, which he called an orthoscheme. Now, the orthoscheme is real ly a skewed tetrahedron, because its four triangula r faces are at 90 angles, whereas, our familiar tetrahedron has tr iangular faces at 60. In any event, Schlafi showed that a polyhedron can be subdivided into component parts, each less than our standard tetrahedron, much like an atom can be subdivided into its component parts of electron neutron, etc. Fuller'sA Quanta Module is a geometrical subdivisio n of the tetrahedron equal to one-sixth of a quarte r tetrahedron. First, a tetrahedron is further divided volumetrica lly into four equal and identical quarters. Each qu arter tetrahedron is divided into six identical irregular tetrahedron , which appear as three right-hand and three left-h and volumetric units equal in volume to one-twentyfourth of the or iginal tetrahedron. Fuller's B Quanta Module is a geometrical subdivisi on of the octahedron equal to one-sixth of the frac tional unit described by subtracting the quarter tetrahedron fr om the eighth octahedron. Likewise, an octahedron i s divided volumetrically into eight equal and identical units equaling one-eighth of the volume of the octahedro n. Thus, the quarter tetrahedron defined by the six A Quanta Mod ules is subtracted from the one-eighth octahedron, and the remaining fractional unit is subdivided into six id entical irregular tetrahedra, again appearing as th ree right-hand units and three left-hand units. "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" The A and B Quanta Modules have the same 1/24th (on e-twentyfourth) volume but each are of a different but complementary shape. Together, they structure the t etrahedron and the octahedron and we know that thes e two structure the isotropic vector matrix. Without gett ing into the complex geometry of these polyhedra, t he A Module has the right angles of the orthoscheme, while the B Module unfolds into a six sided, multitriangled p olygon. As Fuller describes them, \"The A and B Quanta Modules may possible quantize o ur total experience. It is a phenomenal matter to d iscover asymmetrical polyhedral units of geometry that are reorientably compositable to occupy one asymmetrica l polyhedral space; it is equally unique that, despit e disparate asymmetric polyhedral form, both have t he same volume; and both associate in different kinds of si mplex and complex, symmetrical and asymmetrical coh erent systems. While they consist, in their positive and negative aspects, of four different asymmetrical sh apes, their unit voume and energy quanta values provide a geometry e lucidating both fundamental structuring and fundame ntal and complex intertransformings, both gravitational and radiational.\" Now comes the amazing part. The A modules can combi ne with each other in three unique ways, each of wh ich combine as one regular tetrahedron. The A modules c an also combine with the B modules in seven unique ways, each of which also result in a single whole tetrahe dron. Thus, the correspondence with the Law of Thre e and the Law of Seven! And, as Fuller observes, the identical volumes but the uniquely different energy-transforming calabili ties hint at correspondence with the behaviors of protons and ne utrons. They are not mirror images of each other, b ut like the proton and neutron, they are energetically intertra nsformable and due to different shapes they have a slight difference in mass relationships. Finally, if each A and B module have a volume of l/ 24th of a tetrahedron, and we know that a cube has a tetra- volume of three, then the volume of our cube is sev enty-two! In fact, the cube is composed of 72 energ y quanta modules, of which there are 48 A modules and 24 B m odules. Herein lies the occult correspondence of th e cube and 72! The cube is actually three module layers deep a nd the layering occurs around each of its eight ver texes. Thus, a single frequency cube is formed in one way by super imposing four eighth octahedra on each of the four triangular"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"faces of the regular tetrahedron. A two frequency c ube is formed by superimposing eight eighth octahed ron one each of the eight triangular faces of the regular cuboct ahedron. This is important to remember in relation to the Law of Twelve, since a cube formed over a cuboctahedron ha s a nucleus, which can serve as a complementation d omain for the holy spirit. A tetrahedron is composed exclusively of 24 A modul es, of which twelve are positive and twelve are neg ative. The double tet star tetrahedron of our \"synergetic tetrahedron unfolded\" would ther efore be composed of 48 A modules. "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" Thus, the 48 A modules in the cube above described. The cube also has 24 B modules which is the comple mentation domain of the holy spirit in the duo-tet cube. A partial hierarchy is as follows: FORM TETRA-VOLUMES TOTAL A&B MODULES tetrahedron 1 24 (24 + 0) double-tet-cube 3 72 (48 + 24) octahedron 4 96 (48 + 48) Cuboctahedron 20 480 (336 + 144) two-frequency cube 24 576 (384 + 192) Please note that all of the above total quanta modu les are divisible by whole numbers into our solar p recessional cycle of 25,920 years. This is an important corresp ondence that shows that the primary geometric polyh edrons are subdivisions of the solar cycle. Another key to the cube and its relationship to the messianic cycle regards the sum of its planar angl es. Starting with the tetrahedron, B. Fuller states a geometric maxim um that, \"the sum of all the angles around all vert exes of any polyhedral system is evenly divisible by the sum of the angles of a tetrahedron\" and the volumes of al l such systems may also be expressed in tetrahedra. The sum of the planar angles of a tetrahedron is 720 as 4 vertexe s x 180 = 720. Likewise, the sum of the planar angles of an octahe dron is 1440 or 6 x 240. The sum of the planar angl es of the cube is 2160 or 8 vertexes x 270 or 6 faces x 360. Thus, both the cube and our cube unfolded as cross equal in angular degrees the 2160 years in the mess ianic cycle associated with one sign of the Zodiac or solar pre cessional cycle. It is for this reason that the anc ient occult wisdom represented the perfect man or fully manifested man as a cube. The six sides of the cube represent the six lower principles with the seventh principle or ATMA as th e hidden central point within the cube. Thus, the p erfect septenary man would not be represented geometricall y as a seven sided polyhedra, but as a six-sided po lyhedra (the cube) with the spark of God residing within. D. Conclusion In conclusion, our symbols of ten disclose a much h igher order expressed as the Law of Ten. St. Thomas Aquinas expressed his understanding of the hierarchy of ten as Inestimabilis et Incomparabilis Magnitudinis! It is upon the system of ten that the universe is b uilt. Every complete hierarchy consists of ten degr ees. Every atom, molecule, cell, organ, man, planet, sun, solar syst em and galaxy or as H.P.B. would say, every God, Mo nad and atom is a completed whole constructed upon the deca d. Each hierarchy has a dual tendency and function to exist both as a part and a whole. At every level of hiera rchic organization there is a self-assertive tenden cy that is dis- associative and an integrative tendency that is ass ociative. This polarity between the part function a s self-assertive and the whole function as integrative is a universa l fabric of life. Dynamic equilibrium exists when t hese two tendencies counter balance each other. The ten degr ees of each hierarchy is structured by the Law of S even and the Law of Three, together. The visible, manifest world is septenary. The invisible, unmanifest world behi nd the scene is threefold, with associative, dis-associative and neutralizing forces moving the septenary world in its creations. In addition, the septenary forces of nature operate wi thin the four levels of our Zohar and changing the Quabbalist name for the more modern nomenclature of Plato to: Atziluth --------- - Archetypal world Briad ------------- Intellectual or creative world Yetzirah --------- - Formative or Astral Assiah ------------- Physical Our final symbol of ten is Poculum PanSophia"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" SOLAR CYCLE OF NAROS One of the greatest secrets of the ancient mysterie s was the solar cycle of Naros or Neros. This was r eflected in the age of the world according to early Christians at 6 ,000 years. Noah was 600 years old at the time the flood ended and a new age began. This symbolism was a bind to s how a cycle of 600 years which extended over 10 age s. The beginning of each age saw the birth of a great avat ar or spiritual leader for that culture. Godfrey Higgens in his ANACALYPSIS (1833) describes the Jewish cycle of Naros begining with Enoch, who did not die but ascended to heaven. The second ended wi th the birth of Noah. The third ended with Noah lea ving the Ark when was 600 years old. The fourth ended about the time of Melchizadek, that high priest of God wh om the Essenes in the Dead Sea Scrolls also say lives fore ver. As to the fifth and sixth cycle, the author is unclear. However, Higgens places the end of the seventh cycl e with Elijah, another prophet who did not die, but left his cloak and astral body to his successor Elisha. The eighth cycle began about 600 B.C.with the birth of Cyrus, the king who was described as a sun god and later liberated the Jews from the Babylonian Captivity. The ninth cycle began with the birth of Christ, making eight complete cycles o f 600 years each before the birth of the Messiah. H iggens makes no mention of the tenth avatara, but I would sugges t he ponder the birth of Mohammed at 608 A.D. Higgens touches upon an important hidden correspond ence in the religious traditions described in the a bove genealogy. The first reference was to Melchizedek, that priest of the Most High God who was initiated into the mysteries of the sun oracle by Manu himself. At Jer u(salem), he gave bread and wine to Abraham and ini tiated him to become the father of the Jewish and Persian nati ons. In the Dead Sea Scrolls (Hebrews 7:1-3) Melchi zedek was spoken of as a heavenly high priest who also lived forever, \" He is without father and mother or genea logy, and has neither beginning of days nor end of life, but rese mbling the Son of God he continues a priest forever .\" The next reference was to the personage called Enoc h by the Jews and EDRIS by the Persians. Both of th ese cultures related Enoch to Elijah and in both religi ous traditions, both of whom did not die. Likewise, there is an occult Jewish and Persian (called Al-Choder) tradit ion that Elijah previously incarnated as \"Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest.\" Phinehas had single handedly saved the destruction of the Jewis h tribe from the wrath of Jehovah when the people of Moses were led astray into idolatry. Steiner confirms this tra dition of the continous line of descent thru the high priest sons of Aaron of the Levite line. Later, the soul of Phinehas incarnates in the perso nage of Elijah, who used as a physical vehicle the body of Naboth, the vineyard owner. The Bible tells the story that after Elijah defeated King Ahab's priests of Baal w ith his sacrifice on the alter of 12 stones on Mt. Carmel, Queen Jeze bel, herself an initiated priestess of Astarte, dec lared her revenge upon Elijah with a death sentence. However, in the Bible, Elijah did not die but passed his mantle on to Elisha, a Korahite. The one who did die was Naboth the vineya rd owner who refused to sell his garden to King Aha b. Through a scheme of Queen Jezebel, he was later inv ited to a feast where he was stoned to death. Thus, Naboth the physical vehicle for the spirit of Elijah was murde red in satisfaction of the death sentence of Jezebe l. In the GOSPEL OF ST. MARK, Steiner says that Elijah bore within him the folk-spirit of the ancient Heb rew people. This archangel or folk-spirit corresponds t o the fifth degree of initiation in the ancient mys teries of Mithras, where the adept is called a \"Persian\"."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"In the sixth degree of the Mithras mysteries, the a dept is called a \"sun hero\" (heliodromos). During t he Babylonian captivity, the future King Cyrus is born, then aban doned and raised by a Shepard. Destiny followed him as if he was on a Divine mission to conquer Persia and liberate the Jews. Finally, in 538 B.C. he ordered the recon struction of the Temple of Jerusalem and sent the Jews home from exi le. Cyrus was called CAI COSROE derived from CORESH , a Persian name for the sun and the prophecy of Isaiah correctly refers to his birth and not the birth of Christ. By both the Jews and the Persians, he was called a \"sun her o\" and \"sun king\" and maybe was another incarnation of Elijah at the level of the sixth degree of the Mithras myster ies. In relation to the Christ event this incarnating pe rsonalty called the Naros was not the Christ, but a t least with St. John the Baptist, the messenger of Christ. The Old Testament contains many references to Elijah as an angelic entity who does not die and has a prophecy to return, \"Beh old, I send my angel to prepare the way before me.\" In a veiled secret, the Gospel of St. Luke recognized the retur ned Elijah in the person of the preacher in the wil derness, who ate locusts and wild honey. His mother Elizabeth, wife of the priest Zacharias, was \"of the daughters of A aron\" and the angel Gabriel said, \"He shall go in the spirit and power of Elias\". In the Jewish cycle, we see the Naros exoterically accepted as an angelic being who never dies in the figures of Enoch, Noah, Melchizadek, Phinehas, Elijah and fina lly John the Baptist (who did die). In the figures of Noah and King Cyrus we see an esoteric connection with this angelic being. There are many gaps in between and q uestions to answer for occult research. However, this cycle mak es evident at least two important truths. First, th e idea of an incarnating personality is accepted exoterically by Western religions and second, this personality is a messenger from God who directs the spiritual guidance of the Jewish and Persian nations. Historically the Naros cycle represents a luni-sola r cycle of 31 periods of 19 years anf one period of 11 years making 600 years of 7200 solar months and 7421 luna r months and 219,145/6 solar days. Every 60 years t here is a syzygy cycle when all the planets are in conjunctio n, aligned in a straight line with the sun. The 19 years cycle probably represents the lunar Metonic cycle exoteri cally named after Meton in 433 B.C. but was most ce rtainly known to ancient Chaldean astronomers. Lunar phases recur on the same day of the month every 19 years. It happens that 235 synodic lunar months are equal to 19 years, which were split into two sets of 12 sola r years with 12 lunar months and 7 solar years with 13 lunar months . Although I can not say with certainty, the 600 ye ar cycle represents a renewal of the conjunction of the sun and planets on a new moon at the vernal equinox. Fo r the Gautama Buddha in the Eastern Neros, this conjuncti on occurred on a Wednesday, the day of Mercury. In Hebrew, the gematria for the letter SAMACH is 60 and as mem final is 600. Many Biblical names use this cipher. Also, it was the practice of the hierophant in the ancient m ysteries to make the mark of the 600 on the candida te,\"And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit od wis dom: for Moses samached him (Joshua), laying his ha nds on him\". In Ireland the X was the letter for the 600 and the life of the Phenn(icshe) was 600 years as was the life of the Phoenix (or Phen-X) for both the Greeks and Egyptia ns. The good Madame H.P.Blavatsky comments in THE SECRE T DOCTRINE (III): \"the numerical base of 6, the exoteric figure given by Arya Bhatta, was made good use of. From the fir st secret cycle of 600-the naros, transformed successively into 60, 000 and 60 and 6 and with other noughts added into other secret cycles-down to the smallest, an archaeologist and m athamatician can easily find it repeated in every c ountry, known to every nation. Hence the globe was divided into 6 0 degrees, which multiplied by 60, became the great year. Hence also the hour with its 60 minutes of 60 seconds eac h. The Asiatic people count a cycle of 60 years als o, after which comes the lucky seventh decad and the Chinese have their small cycle of 60 days, the Jews of 6 days, t he Greeks of 6 centuries-the Naros again. The Babylonians had a great year of 3,600 being the Naros multiplied by 6 . The Tartar cycle called Van was 180 years, or three sixties; t his multiplied by (12 X 12) 144 makes 25,920 years, the exact period of revolution of the heavens.\" The Naros cycle does not readily coincide with any of the periods of the Messianic cycle of 2,160 year s as Higgens observed below in the Enoch cipher. However, every 72 years, the precessional cycle moves one degree a nd thru a circle of 360 degrees, this equals the great solar precessional year of 25,920 years. If one Naros is given for one degree of the precessional cycle at 72 years, then this would equal the Hindu Kali Yuga (72 X 600) of 432,000 years. We know that a Messianic cycle for the third cultur al epoch began with Melchizadek and Abraham which w as carried thru the 3 X 14 generations of the St. Matt hew Gospel to the birth of Christ. Higgens correctl y suggests that the age of Enoch said to be 365 years would at firs t glance appear to be a cipher for the solar year. However, if Eusebius correctly set Enoch's age at 360 years by his own calculations from the birth of Methusaleh a s suggested by commentators, the the historical age of Enoch wa s really an intercalation to square with the preces sional cycle. The first three Neros total 1,800 years and added t o that the age of Enoch at 360 years, then begining the age of Melchizadek, we have the 2,160 years of the 42 gene rations of the St. Matthew Gospel. Convergence of Adepts"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Some commentators like to ascribe to the Naros cycl e twelve ages of 600 years each for a total of 7200 years in a completed world age. The difference would mean th at the ten incarnations of the Messengers who spiritually direct that particular culture, would o ver the longer cycle appear every 720 years instead of every 600 years. I think it more reliable to follow the 6 00 year cycle since it fits neatly with the phenome non of the convergence of adepts that occured around 600 B.C. and coincides with the birth of Christ 600 years la ter. One cannot but notice that the age of 600 B.C. was truly a remarkable time, a unique convergence of ad epts. In India, the Bodhisattva named Gautama rose to the rank of Buddha. In China, Loa-Tzu and Confucius taught a new religious revival. In Greece, Heraclit us and Pythagorus ushered in mathematics, geometry, philosophy and legislative government. In Judea, the lineage of the great prophets began, starting with Elijah, then, Isaiah, Hezekiah, Jerem iah, Ezekiel, Daniel and Ezra. In the GOSPEL OF ST.MARK (1912), Steiner says that \"the souls of the Hebrew prophets are reincarnations of initiates who had li ved in other nations and who attained certain stage s of initiation\". The adepts of former cultures such as in the Hindu, Persian, and Egyptian, all passed thr u the stages of initiation within their own national elem ent. We know historically that in the fifth grade of the mysteries of Mithras, the successful candidate was given the name of the nation to which he belonged. Thus, an initiate was called a Persian or in the case of the disciple Nathaniel, he was called by Christ, \"a n Israelite indeed, im whom there is no guile.\" This national i dentity occurs because the adept in reaching the fi fth grade was lifted up into the spiritual realm of communion with the archangel od folk-spirit who ruled over t hat particular nation. However, one cannot speak of the Hebrew prophets in the same sense as an initiated adept in the Myster y schools. Even the Bible does not describe how the p rophets went thru their occult training. Without suc h an occult initiation, the spiritual vision of the prop hets could only have arisen from their own inner ge nius. The souls of these great prophets did not incarnate fro m previous lives as a Jew in Judea, but arose from their past lives as initiates from various other nations and cultures. Their spiritual genius was an inherit ed memory from a past life as an initiate. Starting 600 B.C, there begins a gradual convergenc e of adepts brought together in one focal point to be born again out of the blood of the Jewish people. The ce nter of gravity of this convergence was the Babylon ian Captivity of the Jews from 587 to 538 B.C. With the destruction of the ten northern Tribes by the Assyr ians in 722 B.C., the two remaining tribes preserved the Hebriac tradition in the southern kingdon in Jerus alem. In 597 B.C. Nebuchadnezzer began the deportation of a select group of Jewish leaders. Within ten years, he had razed the city and the Temple and deported the entire population. The Jews in Babylon represent th e last third of a combined mystery stream of the 3 X 14 ge nerations of the Gospel of St. Matthew. This priest ly line begins with Melchizadek, then the sons of Aaron and the house of David. This was the branch from Abrah am and his wife Sarah who with the child Isaac, founde d the Hebrew nation. The great prophets of the capt ivity, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel and Ezra were all descend ant from the Zadek line converging in ancient Chald ea. The other line from Abraham and his wife, the Egypt ian Hagar, began with Ishmael and founded the Persi an nation, spiritually guided by the Naros Zarathustra . Against this background of the Jews in Babylon oc cured the timely incarnation of Zarathas or Nazarathos in to the mystery sanctuary of Marduk and the cult of Ishtar. Steiner says that Zarathas was the teacher of the Hebraic initiates during the captivity. He w as also the teacher of Pythagoras who one Naros later incar nated as one of the three Magi Kings and later beca me a disciple of Christ. Corresponding to the adept Jeth ro who taught Moses in the desert, Nazarathos was t he leading spirit of this Chaldean mystery school and his ordained task was to appear one Naros later in an incarnation as the Solomon Jesus child. Against this background of the Chaldean mystery sch ool, we have at the same historical time the birth of the Buddha mystery stream. When the Gautama Buddha achi eved nirvana, he passed on his mantle to the Bodhisattva who later incarnated in the person of J eschu ben Pandira, the Teacher of Righteousness in the Essene community in Qumran. This mystery stream mer ged one Naros later when the nirmanakaya of Buddha was given to the Nathan Christ child. The purpose of the convergence of adepts and the th ree mystery streams was to prepare for the Christ e vent one Naros later. This three-fold merger of the Jewi sh, Chaldean and Buddha mystery streams through the ir human representatives of Ezekiel (and the other pro phets), Nazarathos and the Bodhisattva was only mad e possible thru the archangel Michael. Prior to this great age, Michael had been the guiding folk-spirit of the Jews until He ascended, in his turn, to the status of Spirit of the Age. Michael as countenance of the sun, whose angelic body would host the Christ ego as He descended thru the heavenly spheres to incarnation during the baptism at the Jordan river, led a golde n age which converged in the Babylonian Captivity. The Star of the Magi"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The convergence of Adepts starting 600 B.C. was a r emarkable historical event in preparation for the C hrist event one Naros later. As told by R. Steiner in THE GOSPEL OF ST.MATTHEW, about 100 B.C. the Bodhisattva of Buddha incarnated in Judea in the pe rson of Jeschu ben Pandira. He became the Teacher o f Righteousness as described in the Dead Sea Scrolls at the Essene community at Qumran. His task was to teach and prepare the members of this community the cosmic significance of the birth of the Messiah. P liny said there were about 6,000 Essenes at the monaster y at Qumran. Of course, only a few of these members could understand the signs of the times. At the sam e historical time, the Magi of the Chaldean mystery school were also waiting and watching for the signs of the birth of their Naros, Zarathustra. Dr. Ernest Martin in his book, THE STAR THAT ASTONI SHED THE WORLD (1991) describes the astronomical events that occured in the heavens in the two years prior to the birth of Christ. Of cour se, there is always an astronomical key to every great symbol . One key was described by a Jewish Rabbi named Abarbanel (1437-1508) who said to look for a conjun ction of Saturn and Jupiter in the constellation of Pisces as the time for the birth of the Messiah. Kepler al so suggested this sign as did the good Madame H.P. Blavatsky in ISIS UNVEILED. In the 19th. century an extrapolation of this confi guration by Ideler showed three conjunctions of Jup iter and Saturn in Pisces in the year 7 B.C. However, the pr oblem with this date is that it is too early to squ are with the writings of early Christians who insist the bir th date to be between 3 to 1 B.C. Dionysius Exigus in the 6th. century gave a date of 1 B.C. Most historians place the birth of Christ in the sp ring of 4 B.C. This stumbling block comes from the testimony of Josephus who wrote that King Herod die d soon after an eclipse of the moon and was buried before the spring Passover. Nineteenth century astr onomers calculated that such an eclipse occured dur ing the evening of March 13, 4 B.C. which was just one month before the spring Passover. The problem here as stated by Dr. Martin is that 29 days between the ec lipse and the Passover was too short a time to cond uct \"the grandest funeral ever bestowed upon a King\" so grea t as Herod. Dr. Martin selects the date of January 10, 1 B.C. a t which time there was a total eclipse of the moon at 1:00 a.m. as seen from Jerusalem. This gives 12 1/2 week s to conduct a funeral for Herod before the spring Passover. This also solves another problem. The Bib le says that King Herod consulted with the Magi concerning the signs in the heavens and as a result , he ordered the slaughter of the innocents, being all male children under two years of age. However, nothing s pectacular occurred in the heavens between the Jupi ter- Saturn conjunction in 7 B.C. and the supposed histo rical date of Herod's death in 4 B.C. As a matter of astronomical fact, Dr. Martin states that the heavens were silent until the spring of 3 B.C., when everything under the sun began to happen. He h as shown several of the major conjunctions as follo ws: 19 May 3 BC 22:47 mercury-saturn 12 June 3 BC 16:06 venus-saturn 12 Aug. 3 BC 5:20 venus-jupiter 31 Aug. 3 BC 21:03 mercury-venus 14 Sept. 3 BC 5:05 jupiter-regulus 17 Feb. 2 BC 15:15 jupiter-regulus 8 May 2 BC 16:10 jupiter-regulus 17 June 2 BC 17:53 jupiter-venus 26 Aug. 2 BC 15:15 mars-jupiter The Hebrew name for the planetary spirit of Jupiter is (T) ZADEK. From this name derives the priestly caste of Melchizedek, the King of Righteousness. The plan etary angel is SACHIEL, the intelligence is IOPHIEL and the spirit is HISMAEL. Jupiter is also the ruli ng planet of the constellation of Pisces in the fou rth precessional cycle. As Jupiter is the king planet, so Regulus is the Ki ng Star, located in the foot of the lion in the con stellation of Leo. It is one of the Royal stars: Regulus in Leo, Aldebaran in Taurus, Antares in Scorpio and Fomalha ut in the mouth of Pisces, on which falls the water poure d out by Aquarius. In the Hebrew camp in the desert , the central division was four-fold representing the anc ient four elements and the four fixed signs of the zodiac, which in turn were ruled by the four Royal stars. T he King Star Regulus rules in Leo the sign of the l ion, which is also the \"lion of the tribe of Judah.\" The gematria of J(10), U(6), D(4), A(1) and H(5) is 26 , the number of JHVH Jehovah. The three conjunctions of J upiter and Regulus would have looked viewing from Jerusalem like a halo or crown circling over the Ki ng star. The conjunction of Jupiter-Venus on June 17, 2 B.C. was separated by only 0.01 degrees. This would hav e appeared viewed from Jerusalem as a brilliant doubl e star also visible west from Babylon. Again, 72 da ys later, a last conjunction of Jupiter-Mars occurred in midafternoon. The significance of this conjuncti on"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"corresponds to what Steiner says in THE MISSION OF FOLK SOULS (1910) that the nations of Asia Minor and Western Europe are especially under the influenc e of the planetary spirit of Jupiter. To prepare fo r the descending Christ spirit, a special occult arrangem ent was made with the planetary spirit of Mars to a llow JAHVE as Elohim (Spirit of Form) to work in the blo od of the Hebrew Semitic nation. The God of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob worked in the blood without interfe rence from the Mars planetary spirit thru the 3 X 1 4 generations of the St. Matthew Gospel. Dr. Martin relates that all the ancient planets, ex cept Saturn, were clustering together in the conste llation of Leo, while the moon was entering Leo and the sun wa s entering the sign of Virgo, the celestial Virgin. He says, \"Recall that the account in the New Teatament said the Magian astrologers saw the star rising ab ove the eastern horizon. And on August 12, 3 B.C., Jupiter rose as a morning star which soon came into conjunc tion with Venus. That started Jupiter off on a journey i n which six conjunctions with other planets and the star Regulus took place. The final planetary union was t he massing of the planets which occured with Mars, Venus and Mercury on August 27, 2 B.C.\" Indeed, the signs in the heavens that occurred betw een 3 and 2 B.C. were brilliant, spectacular and fu ll of Messianic meaning. Finally, in December of the foll owing year of 2 B.C., the planet Jupiter left its c luster with the other three planets and continued its apparent westward motion, until on December 25, it became stationary over Bethlehem. This stationary position between the retrograde motions of Jupiter lasted a bout six days and also placed its position in the abdome n region of the sign Virgo, the Celestial Virgin. The Two Jesus Children Dr. Martin's astronomical re-working of the planeta ry motions immediately prior to the birth of Christ , set up two important dates. The first being the conjunc tion of Jupiter and Venus on June 17, 2 B.C. as a c elestial impregnation of the King Planet and the Mother, Ven us. The second being the traditional Christmas day event of December 25th., 1 B.C. when the King Plane t stood still over Bethlehem for six days. Certainly one could speculate that these two planet ary events were celestial signs for the birth of St . John the Baptist and the birth of the Christ child. The anci ent wisdom of the Jewish Naros could predict the me ssenger of Christ in John the Baptist from the Phinehas-Eli jah (sons of Aaron) line and in the line of the Per sian Naros, the Magi went to Bethlehem looking for signs for the re-birth of Zarathustra. The profund esote ric wisdom here is that the Magi searched for and accep ted the birth of the Christ child in Bethlehem as a n incarnation of Zarathustra. Thus, the Persian Naros became the physical vehicle for the incarnation of the Macro-cosmic Christ ego thirty years later at the b aptism in the Jordan. However, at the Essene monastery at Qumran, the pup ils of the Bodhisattva Jeschu ben Pandira were look ing for more than only two signs in the heavens. They k new something that the rest of the then ancient wor ld did not know and the key to this secret was preserved i n the MANUAL OF DISCIPLINE 9:9-11 from one of the Dead Sea Scrolls as follows: \"They shall depart from none of the councels of the Law to walk in the stubbornness of their hearts, b ut shall be ruled by the primitive precepts in which the men of the community were first instructed until there shall come the Prophet and the Messiahs of Aaron and Isra el.\" Certainly the Essenes were looking for three celest ial events, the sign of the Prophet and the signs o f the TWO MESSIAHS. Of course this passage means nothing to t hose scholars who understand there to be only the o ne Messiah of the New Testament. Other passages in the text refer to the child of the virgin Mary to be c alled the \"Son of the Most High\" and \"Son of God\" and \"His ki ngdom shall be forever\". For the first time these similar passages found in the Luke gospel at the an nunciation to Mary by the Angel Gabriel, occur in a Palestinian text outside the Bible. The Luke gospel was written in Greek and these passages were writt en in Aramaic, the language of Christ and the Essenes, bu t the meaning is exactely the same. Here in the two Messiahs of the Essenes lies the mystery of the two Jesus children. Probably the most remarkable esoteric secret reveal ed by Steiner was the story of this mystery. The Bi ble hints several times to the genealogy of the Messian ic line coming from the House of David. However, ou tside the Bible in texts and archeological remains, there really is no other mention of this term, the House of David, as an historical entity. King David had two sons, S olomon and Nathan. The Nathan line was the priestly line referred to in the Books of Enoch and the Essene sc roll as the Messiah of Aaron and into which we saw the incarnations of Phinehas and Elijah. The genealogy of this line is preserved in the Gospel of St. Matt hew. The Messiah of the kingly line is referred in the Old T estament Psalms and the genealogy of the Nathan lin e is reflected in the gospel of St. Luke. Commentators h ave tried for centuries to reconcile these two Gosp el accounts of the House of David as well as the infan cy stories of Jesus. Now the conflict can be resolv ed by the secret of the birth of two Jesus children, one born as reflected in the St. Matthew Gospel and one bor n as reflected in the gospel account given in St. Luke."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The genealogy given in the St. Matthew gospel goes back to the beginning of the Hebrew nation in Abrah am and the blood line established through his son Isaa c. The key is the 3 X 14 blood line generations as an historical preparation of the physical, etheric and astral bodies of members of the Jewish race as a v ehicle suitable to bear the ego incarnation of the Christ when He appeared. This evolution from Abraham to Je sus proceeds thru three stages as described in the gosp el. The first stage was the 14 generations from Abr aham to the Kings as a preparation of the physical body; th e second was the 14 generations from the Kings to t he Babylonian Captivity as a preparation of the etheri c body and the third was the 14 generations for the astral body lasting a Neros from the Babylonian Captivity to the birth of the Solomon child as an incarnation of Zarathustra. This is why the Magi, who were looking for their Naros, accepted the birth of the Bethleh em child as Zarathustra. This great Naros had in forme r times sacrificed his etheric body and gave it to Moses and also sacrificed his astral body and passed it o ver to the Egyptian Hermes, both great initiates an d founders of cultural epochs. Now in this incarnatio n, this great initiate gave his fourth principle or ego to the Bethlehem child of the St. Matthew Gospel. (It is i nteresting to note the Vatican frescoes painted by Pinturicchio for Pope Alexander VI in which one sce ne shows IO-Isis seated with Hermes Trismegistes, a s law giver to the Egyptians and also seated with Mos es as law giver to the Jews. Hermes was called the Egyptian Moses and this series of paintings was ins pired by the Hermetic-Cabbalistic writings of Pico Della Mirandola, who undoubtedly knew of the Hermes-Moses connection.) The genealogy of the St. Luke Gospel goes back 77 g enerations to Adam and Eve, the original ancestral parents of Genesis. Steiner says that there existed an original Adam-soul that had been preserved in t he Great White Lodge by the great sun initiate, Manu. T he chacter of this soul was such that it had waited the longest to incarnate on earth so that it represente d an Adam-soul as it was before the \"fall\", dating back the the ancient age of Lemuria. This soul was young and pure and had not been burdened by repeated earth lives. Only such an innocent soul could later unite with the Nirmanakaya of the Buddha. This ancestral soul was incarnated into the Nathan Jesus child of Nazar eth born to a young mother. Very supportive of this genealogy of the two Jesus children is the testimony of sister Anne Catherine Emmerich taken from her LIFE OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY as follows: \"I saw the line of descent of the Messias proceedin g from David and dividing into two branches. The ri ght hand one went through Solomon down to Jacob, the fa ther of St. Joseph. I saw the figures of all St. Jo seph's ancestors named in the Gospel on this right-hand br anch of the descent from David through Solomon. Thi s branch has the greater significance of the two; I s aw the line of descent issuing from the mouths of t he separate figures in streams of white colorless ligh t. The figures were taller and looked more spiritua l than those of the left-hand line. Each one held a long f lower stem with hanging leaves like those of palms: this stem was crowned with a great bell-shaped flower shaped like a lily and having five stamens, yellow at the top, from which a fine yellow dust was scattered. These flowers differed in size, vigor, and beauty. The fl ower borne by Joseph, the foster-father of Jesus, was th e most beautiful and purest of all, with fresh and abundant petals. Halfway down this ancestral tree were three rejected shoots, blackened and withered. In this l ine through Solomon there were several gaps separating its fruits more widely from each other. The right-h and and left-hand branches met several times, and they crossed each other at a point a few generations bef ore the end. I was given an explanation about the higher si gnificance of the line of descent through Solomon. It had in it more of the spirit and less of the flesh, and ha d some of the significance belonging to Solomon him self. I cannot express this. The left-hand line of descent went from David throu gh Nathan down to Hell, which is the real name of Joachim, Mary's father, for he did not receive the name of Joachim till ~1 S later, just as Abram was not called Abraham until later. I forget the reason, bu t it will perhaps come back to me. In my visions I often hear Jesus called after the flesh a son of Heli. I saw this whole line from David through Nathan flo wing at a lower level: it generally issued from the navels of the separate figures. I saw it colored red, yell ow, or white, but never blue. Here and there were s tains; then the stream became clear again. The figures upon it were smaller than those of the line through Solomon . They carried smaller branches which hung down sideways a nd had little yellow-green leaves with serrated edg es; their branches were crowned with reddish buds of th e color of wild roses. These were always closed; th ey were not flower-buds but the beginnings of fruits. A double row of little twigs hung down on the same side as the serrated leaves. At a point three or four gener ations above Hell or Joachim, the two lines crossed each other and rose up, ending with the Blessed Virgin.' At the point of crossing I think I think I saw the blood of Our Lady beginning to shine in the stream of descen t.\" A chart of this Solomon-Nathan genealogy is shown i n the front of vol. I of her LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Although she never spoke of the two separate Jesus children in her visions, it may be presumed that it was not the time for this revelation until the 20th cen tury. She definately had the material, but chose to remain silent about this greatest of all mysteries. Thus, born into the era of 3 to 1 B.C. were three g reat persons, St. John the Baptist and the two Jesu s children. (see the painting of Raphael of the Madon na del Duca di Terranuova with St. John the Baptist and the 2 jesus children). The prophecy of the Teacher of Righteousness as the Bodhisattva Jeschu ben Pand ira concerning the coming of the two Messiahs and the p rophet had come true. The priestly Messiah of Aaron was the Nathan Jesus child. The kingly Messiah of I srael was the Solomon Jesus child. There also were two couples named Joseph and Mary. The child of the Solomon line was born in Bethlehem and the child of the Nathan line was born in Nazare th and travelled to Bethlehem \"to be taxed\" as desc ribed in the St. Luke Gospel. Twelve years later on the way to the Temple, thru a n occult process, the Zarathustra ego of the Solomo n child passed over into the bodily sheath of the Nathan ch ild. This was why at the presentation at the Temple , the parents could not recognize the child (see the pain ting of the 2 Jesus children in the temple by Borgo gnone).. It was the wisdom of the Zarathustra ego residing i n the body of the Nathan Jesus child speaking to th e Rabbis and scribes. and the painting of Defendante Ferrara circa 1526 of the Jesus child in the Temple . (In addition, see the painting by Leonardo DaVinci called \"the Virgin of the rocks.\" What is interestin g here is that the staff of the child represented to be th at of St. John the Baptist was ADDED after DaVinci painted it. This photo is from the London Gallery, where I have seen it. There is another version in Paris to which the staff was not added. To me this is a very clear exa mple of a painting of the \"two jesus children\" by a Renaissance adept that has been touched up to redir ect the traditional sensibilities of the public.) After this occult process occurred, the health of t he ego-less Solomon Jesus child declined rapidly an d he thereafter soon died. Likewise, the young mother of the Nathan Jesus child, who had no other children, soon died. The Joseph father of the Solomon child was ve ry old, and prior to the presentation in the Temple , he died. Then, the mother of the Solomon child married the Joseph of the Nathan child and she took Jesus and her other children to the house of the Nathan Josep h where they lived together as a family in Nazareth . The Nathan Jesus child became to be known as Jesus of N azareth and he bore the etheric body of a pre-Adami c soul, the astral body as Nirmanakaya of the Buddha and the ego of Zarathustra. In this way there occur ed a complete fusion of Buddhism and Zorastrianism in th e Hebrew blood line. The historical truth of this family arrangement was preserved by Epiphanius (b.315 A.D.) in his HISTOR Y OF JOSEPH THE CARPENTER. He relates that Joseph had six children by his first marriage, four sons named Jacob, Joseph, James and Simon, and two daugh ters named Assia and Lydia. He was a widower many years before he married the Solomon Jesus mother an d he lived 111 years. Profoundly, Epiphanius also s ays that Joseph was the son of PANDERA, the exoteric Ta lmud name of the Bodhisattva Jeschu ben Pandira. This appears to be another secret in the Essene tra dition that even Steiner does not speak of. If Jose ph lived 111 years as historically stated and died before th e presentation in the Temple at 12 A.D., he would h ave been born about 100 B.C. which is the date established b y Steiner for the time of Jeschu ben Pandira. The eldest son of Joseph named Jacob, a Nazir, beca me the first Christian Bishop until he was martyred by Jewish zealots about 63 A.D. Of the two sisters ref erred to in the New Testament as Miriam and Solome, Salome was said to be a sister of Mary the mother o f Jesus and she was present at the crucifixion and afterwards visited the sepulcher. Another riddle solved by the mystery of the two Jes us children concern the so-called massacre or slaug hter of the innocents as related by the St. Matthew Gospel. Historically, the Magi appeared soon after the bir th of the Solomon Jesus child and Herod ordered the slaug hter of the innocents after his consultation with t he Magi about the great astronomical events that occur ed in the heavens. Why then did St. John the Baptist escape death if all other children under two years old, \"that were in Bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof\" were murdered? Steiner says that the Solomon Jesus child was born first in time was taken to Egypt by Joseph and Mary before the slaughter. Then, after t he massacre and the death of Herod, St. John the Ba ptist and the Nathan Jesus child were born. Although Stei ner says that these births were only a few months a part, we know from the St. Luke Gospel that this would ha ve to been at least six months later, since Elizabe th was six months pregnant at the time of the visit of Mar y and the Annunciation (see Duccio d. 1318) by Gabr iel. "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE LAW OF TWELVE 1. CHRISTIAN ROSENKREUTZ In his book Esoteric Christianity R. Steiner carefu lly weaves a story about the occult life of Christi an Rosenkreutz and his council of twelve members. In an unnamed pl ace in Europe a spiritual lodge of twelve men was f ormed each of which had received into themselves the sum total of the spiritual wisdom of ancient times. The council consisted first of the seven Hindu Rish is of the first cultural epoch designated the India n. These Rishis were the great teachers of the Hindu Brahman cultur e now ascended as stars in the great Bear star foci . The second part of the council consisted of four me mbers each representing the acquired wisdom of each of the post-Atlantean cultural epochs designated as Indian , Persian, Egyptian-Chaldean and Greco-Roman. The four joined the seven Rishis as incarnations in the thirteen century. To this group a twelfth was added representing the wisdom of the then existing scienc es. As Steiner says: \"By means of certain occult processes, the wisdom t hat had passed over from Atlantis to the holy Rishi s had been transmitted to seven of these twelve men. In four o thers lived the wisdom of the sacred mysteries of t he Indian, Persian, Egyptian and Greco-Roman epochs respective ly, and what existed in those days of the kind of c ulture which was to characterize the fifth post-Atlantean epoch constituted the twelfth. The whole range of s piritual life was accessible to these twelve.\" Into this council of twelve a child, a former conte mporary of Christ, was incarnated. The council took this child into their care and instructed him in all their knowledg e and wisdom so that all the wisdom of the precedin g cultural epochs rayed into his soul. For the first time, the twelve great sources of wisdom and religion were u nited into this child in one interconnected unity. After his early death and subsequent incarnation in the fourteenth century, this child became known as Christian Rosenkreutz and his mystery steam of esoteric Christianity called the Rosicrucian. For our purposes, what is important here is that St einer states the obvious, \"Christian Rosenkreutz wa s the thirteenth in the circle of twelve.\" What is the occult significance of this relationshi p of a circle of twelve around a thirteenth who act s as a spiritual leader of mankind? Obviously, there is a correspond ence to Christ and the twelve disciples. 2. MOSES AND CHRIST The tasks of Moses were many. On one level, he was the ordained bearer of the \"I am that I am\" ego pri ncipal. By leading the Jews out of Egypt, he severed the ancie nt clairvoyant consciousness, representative of the Indian, Persian, and Egyptian cultural epochs and created i n his Hebrew sub-race in exile, the germ of a new e go intellectuality necessary to be developed in the su bsequent fourth cultural epoch commencing in the ye ar 747 B.C. On another level, he was ordained to instruct and c ultivate in his Hebrew sub-race the Messianic tradi tion for the coming of the birth of Christ. Imaginatively, I hav e felt that the 40 year journey of Moses and the Je ws through the desert represented in the microcosm, the cosmic jou rney in the macrocosm of Christ descending as a Spi rit of Wisdom through the forty circles of the Zohar and t he corresponding spiritual hierarchies of galaxy, z odiac, planets, and sun to be incarnated on earth as the redeemer o f mankind. In the ordained tasks of Moses we also observe nume rous references to this mysterious correspondence o f twelve- foldness. For example, there is Jacob and his sons, the twelve tribes of Israel; the twelve Judges of Israel, starting with Othniel and ending with Samson; the twelve sco uts sent out by Moses into the desert at the beginn ing of exile; the twelve cakes of the Shewbread are the twelve pr ecious gems in the breastplate and ephod of the hig h priests. Several authors relate the twelve tribes or Israel with an intentional plan by Moses to correspond wit h the twelve signs of the Zodiac, a sort of earthly recapitulati on of the celestial zodiac signs. However, no autho r other than Emil Bock has ventured to state with certainty from spir itual research that there is a correspondence betwe en the celestial star foci and the occurrences of twelve in the Hebr ew-Moses lineage. Obviously, I concur with his conc lusion at the end of Moses by Emil Bock. \"Joshua, the twelve judges of Israel, and Ruth, tog ether appear as a pre-configuration of the same cel estial configuration, which later found a fulfilled realit y on earth as Jesus of Nazareth, the twelve discipl es and Mary. The judges whose twelve-foldness is made visible in a c onscious manner of composition appear as a circle o f representatives of humanity. Later on, the twelve a postles drew the circle of mankind around the Chris t figure. We may discover the heavenly configuration which fashi oned their preparatory and fulfilling human reflect ion around the Christ being, who represented the central point like a brightly shining spiritual sun, the twelve Bodhisattva's figures were gathered in a circle in the spiritual works during the pre-Christian evolutions of humani ty. They comprised the sphere of guidance out of which the d estiny of earthly man received its direction in nat ions and culture. The figures of Joshua, the twelve judges a nd Ruth placed together by the canon of the Old Tes tament, thus create a bridge from the celestial circle of the Bo dhisattva's to the apostles circle on earth.\""},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"This is a remarkable statement by a respected Bibli cal scholar and student of spiritual research which confirms my research in spiritual geometry. 3. OCCULT TWELVE-FOLDNESS From my research, Bock is the first person to imagi ne in the circle of twelve judges and the circle of the apostles a shining spiritual sun as the thirteenth, obviously similar in all respects to the council of twelve an d the thirteenth as Christian Rosenkreutz. This certainly establishes a n occult principal of twelve-foldness for spiritual leaders. More importantly, Bock also sees an additional occu lt principal when he corresponds the circle of spir itual twelve- foldness with actual celestial Bodhisattva's existi ng in space as physical entities of stars and suns. This equation is an ancient one. For example, the Hindus have believ ed for thousands of years that the seven Holy Rishi s have ascended in space and reside in the seven stars of the Great Bear (Big Dipper) constellation. Likewise , in theosophy texts, Buddhist texts and the Secret Doctrine, many examples are given of celestial Bodhisattva's resi ding in space who have physical counterparts on earth. Madame H.P . Blavatsky states, \"In the Northern Buddhist system, it is taught that every Buddha, while preaching the good law on eart h, manifests himself simultaneously in three worlds: in the form less, as Dhyana-Buddha, in the world of Forms as a Bodhisattva, and in the world of desire (earth) as a man...The s tar under which a human entity is born, will remain forever its star, throughout the whole cycle of its incarnations in o ne manvantara. The angel of that star, or the Dhyan i-Buddhi, will be the guiding angel in every new rebirth of the mo nad.\" Thus, (l) every human on earth has a spiritual coun terpart in cosmic space residing in its personal st ar; (2) the movements and groupings of humans on earth have cor responding celestial movements in cosmic space; (3) the most significant spiritual events on earth that occ ur through human incarnations such as Moses, Buddhi and Christ involve a certain twelve-foldness around a thirteen th spiritual sun. Many other examples of twelve-foldness abound from religions sources such as: Mohammed and the twelve successor Iman's of Shiate Islam; King Arthur and t he twelve knights of the round table; Guru Nanak an d his twelve successor gurus (although actually terminated at th e tenth); Mahavira and his twelve disciples called Ganadharas; the Persian Khwajagan (masters of wisdom) and twelv e successors to Yosof of Hamadan; Odin and his twel ve Drottes (priests); and Joseph of Arimathea and the twelve sons of Hebron. In addition there is the 12 chapters of the LAWS OF MANU;the 12 great circle of the circular co uncil of the Dalai Lama;the 12 disciples of the Lao -tzu; the 12 judges of the Egyptian book of the Dead; the 12 main Aesir and their dwellings or thrones in the No rdic tradition; the 12 Palatines of charlemagne; the 12 labours of Hercules; the 12 days in Siegfried's journey and in the 12 kings subjected to him and the 12 lictorians began by Rom ulus. What is the common thread of this spirituael twelve -foldness around a spiritual sun that has correspon dence in both the microcosm on earth and macrocosm of celestial s pace? 4. TWELVE-FOLDNESS OF THE ZODIAC Although referred to as a fixed star, our sun has a n apparent eastward motion through the celestial sp here of the Milky Way galaxy. This eastward motion describes a great circle called the plane of the ecliptic. Imag ining the ecliptic as the equator of the celestial sphere, th e zodiac is a band of star constellations, the widt h of which is thirty degrees above and below the plane of the ecliptic. Our sun passes through this band of the zodiac on i ts motion through celestial space. It is important to observe the zodiac as a BAND of stars in twelve signs and not twelve points around the central sun. Twelve points around a central sun imparts a d ifferent concept, that of a polyhedron instead of a flywheel or bicycle rim. Not a point, the zodiac is a band thirty degrees hi gh and low in declination and a varying magnitudes in width. Because of its length and width, the zodiac as a ba nd of stars can be imagined as a flywheel and bicyc le rim. First, consider the zodiac as a flywheel of a gyros cope with a ring of twelve balls. In Plat No. , eac h ball is considered as a separate band of the zodiac, twelve in all. If set in eternal motion at great speed, i t becomes like a disc with a central axis imagined like the sun. The disc acts like the flywheel of a gyroscope. Preces sion is the motion effect of a body in motion upon another body in motion. Gravity forces have a l80 degree circum ferential effect which produce a 90 degree precessional effec t on bodies in motion. This is how a gyroscope spin s and moves, when downward pressure is applied to the edge of a gyro flywheel, its plane of rotation tilts along a horizontal axis created at the point of force. Or, when pressure is applied to the axis of rotation, the plan of rotat ion of the flywheel tilts precessionly. Therefore, both the axis and th e flywheel tilt at right angles (90) to the point w here the force is exerted. This 90 reaction is the precessional effec t. In our imagination of the sun as the axis of a gyro , whose flywheel is the band of the zodiac, any pre ssure exerted on the flywheel would cause the axis of the sun to rot ate at 90 precessionally. This explains why the sun as a fixed star can rotate in space on its axis."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Second, consider the zodiac as a bicycle rim compos ed of twelve spokes of the zodiac directed from a c entral hub. As shown in Plat No. , many spokes are needed to ke ep the rim from bending outward while the weight le ad is suspended in the center hub. The vertical spokes le ading from the hub to the rim fix the weight load a nd keep the hub from twisting in place or oscillating as a drum head. Buckminister Fuller discovered that it takes a mini mum of twelve spokes to fix the hub in relation to the rim. Any fewer spokes would cause to hub to twist in and out of place and with sufficient weight on the rim, ca use the hub to collapse. All spokes in excess of twelve strengthen the wheel. Imagine now the sun as the hub fixed in place by th e twelve spokes of the zodiac. Twelve stars represe nting the zodiac is the minimum, but we know each band of the zodiac consists of eight to fifteen or more repres entative stars, thus making the cosmic wheel stronger than the mini mum. With each band of the zodiac partitioned into sextants of thirty degrees each, there is plenty of room to all additional spokes represented as new stars (such a s that new star of the magi appearing in Pisces). B. Fuller has similarly observed the hub-rim, tensi on-compression aspect of the sun and zodiac. \"As I considered the twelve unique vectors on freed om constantly and nonredundantly operative between the two poles of the wire wheel - its islanded hub and its islanded equatorial rim-atoll, in effect a Milky Wa y-like ring of a myriad of star islands encircling the hub in a plan e perpendicular to the hub axis - I discerned that this most economic arrangement of forces might also be that m inimum possible system of nature capable of display ing a stable constellar compressional discontinuity and t ensional continuity.\" He goes on to say that a one-island system such as our sun could not exist without the tensional force s as represented by the twelve or more spokes of the zodiac. To thin k that the hub or rim could exist without each othe r is an \"optical illusion\" caused by our scientists inability to per ceive the invisible level of atomic structuring. Also, Plat No. shows a vertical slice of the cosmic wheel. The hub actually appears as an elongated ax is which can have a hollow space located within it. With the sun as hub, the spiral motion in eternity of the sun i n its journey through space describes the fixed hollow hub. Withi n this hollow hub is our solar system of planets wi th motions independent of the zodiac. In conclusion, it takes a minimum of twelve spokes to fix a hub in relation to the rim. This is the fi rst instance of twelve-foldness in our macrocosm extending from zod iac to the earth. The twelve-foldness of the zodiac can be considered in two aspects. First, as the flywheel o f a gyroscope with a central thirteenth sun. Second , as the rim of a cosmic wheel with a fixed solar hub in the center. In either case, in our macrocosm, THERE COULD BE NO FIXED STAR AS CENTRAL SUN WHICH COULD SUPPORT A PLA NETARY SYSTEM WITHOUT THE TWELVEFOLDNESS OF THE BAND OF THE ZODIAC. 5. TWELVE-FOLDNESS OF THE METALS With the exception of the free gases in the atmosph ere, only about twenty elements are found in the na tive state. These elements are divided into metals, semi-metals and non-metals. The three active metal groups are the gold group consisting of gold, silver, copper and lead; the platinum group consists of platinum, palladium, iridium and osmium; the iron group of iron and nickel iron. The semi-metals and non-metals do not concern us here. Approximately two-thirds of the metals fall into th e class of non-directional bonds and their crystal structure can be described by spheres in \"close-packing\", which in t heir case, each sphere contacts twelve others. Here is the (FCC) twelve-foldness of the microcosm of atomic elements . Taking the so-called gold group, we see similar che mical properties arising from similar structure. Al l are rather soft, malleable, ductile and sectile. All are excel lent conductors of heat and electricity, display me tallic luster and hackly fracture and have rather low melting points. In addition, because of the twelvefold close-packi ng, all have"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"isometric hexoctahedral crystal structure with unus ually high densities. This tight close packing allo ws the smallest interstices between atoms and contribute to the dir ectional flow of electrons for the conductivity of electricity, which no other elements share. Finally, the colors of the elements outside the gold group are diffused in th eir combinations with other elements. However, the yellow of gold, t he red of copper, the white of silver and the blue of lead are all inherent atomic properties. Wilheim Pelikan in his book, The Secrets of Metals, discusses the spiritual genesis and qualities of t he seven ancient metals and their relationship with the seven ancien t planets. Lead to Saturn influences; Tin to Jupiter influences; Iron to Mars influences; Gold to Sun influences; Copper to Venus influences; Mercury to Mercury influences; and Silver to Moon influences. The metals of our gold group would compose the quat ernity of the sun and the planets of Saturn, Venus and Moon. The elements tin, iron, mercury would fall out of t his quaternity as their atomic coordination structu re is respectively fourfold, eightfold. The occult relationship betwee n the planets and the native metals is the transmis sion of forces or influences and, obviously, a native element such as silver transmits forces more efficiently than a no n-metal element such as potassium. Thus, the earth in its geologica l evolution has become a depository of the native m etals for the earth to act as a bell in sounding the music of the planetary spheres. The twelve-Fold coordination of the atomic structur e of the gold group displays this occult principal at work in the microcosm. In crystallography, the face-centered cu bic lattice (FCC) is the equivalent to cubic close packing (CCP). This lattice is defined by fourteen spheres, eight at the vertices and six at the faces as in Plat No. . Note that the stacking is in layers of five on the face, four in the center and five on the face o r 5 + 4 + 5 = l4 spheres. Although it has not been proved that this is the greatest density possible for sphere packing, n o other packing of equal spheres has shown a higher density. It will be show n later that there are several possible arrangement s for twelvefold sphere packing, such as cuboctahedron, icosahedron and rhombic dodecahedron. The FCC packing is the mo st dense in nature. In conclusion, we saw in the zodiac, the first inst ance of twelve-foldness in the macrocosm, with the hub-rim twelve-foldness of the sun and the zodiac, spread o ut like islands of tension-compression in the ocean of cosmic space. Here, twelve-foldness is the minimum to supp ort stellar structure. In the native metals, we see the first"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"instance of twelve-foldness in the microcosm. Here, twelve-foldness is the maximum in atomic close pac king wherein each atom is in personal contact with each other atom. This relationship produces unique resul ts by carrying planetary influences, especially the conduit of ele ctricity from the central sun. In both macrocosm an d microcosm, we see the principal of twelve around one, with an occult reversal of expansion in the zodiac and cont raction in the atoms of the native metals. 6. HEXOCTAHEDRON CRYSTAL CLASS Diverging from our discussion of twelve-foldness, i t is interesting to see how the soon to be called \" Law of Twelve\" relates in the microcosm with the precessional effe ct of the Law of Three and the Law of Seven. The gold group belongs to the isometric crystal sys tem, one of SEVEN structural systems in crystallogr aphy. Within this system, is a crystal class called the hexoctah edron, whose symmetry symbol is 4/m 3 2/m. The hexo ctahedral crystal form consists of three axes of fourfold sym metry, four diagonal axes of threefold symmetry and six diagonal axes of twofold symmetry as shown in Plat No. . Thu s, a total of thirteen axis of symmetry. This symme try is the highest possible in crystallography. This hexoctahedral form produces or precesses SEVEN isometric crystals as follows: Form Faces cube ----------------------6 rhombic dodechedron ---- 12 octahedron ----------------- 8 Tetrahexahedron ----------- 24 Trisoctahedron ------------ 24"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Trapezohedron ------------ 24 Hexoctahedron ------------- 48 All of the above SEVEN forms are produced by rotati on, translation and truncation (of tetra) processes of THREE fixed forms of cube, octahedron and rhombic dodecah edron. Thus, the three precess and produce the seve n which precess and close pack in twelve-foldness, creating the gold group with: (l) highest crystal symmetry in nature, and (2) the most dense close packing in nature to carry the life force of nature, electricity or Fohat. 7 EVOLUTION OF SPHERE POINTS There are several different models of twelve-foldne ss, such as the pent-dodecahedreon, the icosahedron and the rhombic dodecahedron. However, there is only one nu cleated twelve-foldness of twelve around one and th is was rediscovered by B. Fuller. To discover this unique structure, follow the evolution of basic sphere poi nt configurations. In Plat No. , we see that four spheres are the grea test number that can be in simultaneous contact and this produces the tetrahedron . By successively adding spheres into the interstices (the valley between spheres), we find a hierarchy of five regular solids from three triangulated close packings of eq ual size spheres. A second set of four spheres also produces a tetrahedron. Thus, it is its own dual ."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" Six spheres produces an octahedron with each sphere touching four others (four-foldness). Adding a third set of set of spheres to the octahed reon, a cube is produced. Thus, the cube is the dual of the octahedron. "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"This cube also represents cubic close packing and c onsists of fourteen spheres as in the fourteen atom s in the close packing of the native metals. However, this close p acking is inherently non-nucleated, there is no cen ter nuclear sphere. If we rearrange the fourteen spheres of the FCC cube around a center nucleus, we obtain the cuboctahedro n , which is twelve spheres around a central thirte enth and we have discovered our model of twelve-foldness around a central thirteenth. If the center or thirteenth sphere is removed, the cuboctahedron twists into an icosahedron . The twelve spheres in the icosahedron each touch fi ve others (fivefoldness). If we add an additional t wenty spheres to each of the twenty triangles of the icosahedron, we obtain the regular dodecahedron ."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" Thus, the dodecahedron is the dual of the icosahedr on. In all, this Concentric Hierarchy evolution disclos es a hierarchy of five regular (Platonic Relationsh ips) solids from the tetrahedron on (its own dual) to the octahedron , the octahedron to the cube (its dual); then after close packing the cube, from the icosahe dron the dodecahedron (its dual)."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" In the middle is our cuboctahedron , the only close packed nucleated solid. In conclusio n, the evolution is summarized HERE"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" and HERE. "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 8 THE CUBOCTAHEDRON The cuboctahedron is the most unique configuration in cosmos. The regular solids above described date back to Pythagorus and were first published exoterically by Plato in the Timaeus where he correlated them with the respective elements of fire, air, earth and water. The dodecahedron has been recognized by the most an cient Hindu culture in the zodiac as Makaram (Capricorn), the g eometrical model initiated by the Demiurgus in cons tructing the"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"material universe. Likewise, St. John in the Apocal ypse relates the twelve gates of the new Jerusalem to a celestial dodecahedron. If the regular solids have been recognized for thou sands of years, why has the cuboctahedron been hidd en? Fuller says, \"Being the zerophase of energy the (cuboctahe dron) is inherently invisible and non-empirically d iscoverable, which accounts for its having been so long unrecogn ized.\" Besides rediscovering the cuboctahedron, Fuller nam es it the dymaxion or vector-equilibrium. As a soli d it consists externally as eight triangles and six squares . Using the tetrahedron as prime unity, it has a volu me of twenty. Internally, the twelve vertexes exten d in tangential radius from the original twelve spheres surrounding the nuclear sphere. The length of each of the twel ve vectors extending from the center to the vertexes are all o f equal length, thus, vector equilibrium. The cuboctahedron also defines a sixty degree coord ination system inherent in all cosmos. The western scientific tradition has adopted a ninety degree three dimensi onal coordinate system to describe nature. However, a sixty degree system operates circumferentially or radiall y and allows for modeling in dimensions beyond the third of traditional physics. At every internal convergence there are always twelve vectors coming together and they are always convergent at sixty degrees with respect to each other. In the future, all geometry will be bas ed upon a sixty degree coordinate system. Although one of the original 23 Archimedean solids, the cuboctahedron has had a long standing unrecogn ized past, even by crystallographers. I can find no crystal st ructure in any of the elements that even suggest th is form. The other twelve vertexed solids such as icosahedron an d pentagonal dodecahedron find themselves in nature as aluminum alloys (WAL and MoAl ) and chlorine hydrat e respectively. The reason for this is that the cub octahedron is a system and not a structure. As a system it is the common denominator of the tetrahedron, octahedr on and cube, representing the equilibrium of the outward radial thrust of victors balanced by the circumferentially restraining chord forces. An omnidirectional equilibrium of for ces of equal lengths in twelve-foldness. The tetrah edron is the prime non-nucleated system or volume in cosmos. As a structure, the Cuboctahedron exists not as itself , but only as a structure for close packing around a nuclear sphe re. The cuboctahedron is the prime nucleated struct ural system of cosmos. 9 THE STRUCTURAL MODEL We can now correspond the model of circle of twelve around a spiritual leader as thirteenth directly w ith the cuboctahedron. The circle is twelve for no other re ason than the fact that twelve is the most that can be packed together wherein there is still personal contact be tween the center or thirteenth."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" Only the cuboctahedron has a center nucleus. The ot her twelvefold regular solids as icosahedron and do decahedron do not have a center sphere and therefore cannot se rve as our model for twelve around one. However, th ere is a unique relationship between the cuboctahedron and i cosahedron. In our discussion of the evolution of sphere points , it was stated that the cuboctahedron twists into the icosahedron. This happens because as a system and not a structur e, the cuboctahedron is inherently unstable. The on ly stable structure is an equilateral triangle, of which the cuboctahedron has eight. However, it also has six squares faces which are un stable in relation to the triangles. When pressure is applied to the cuboctahedron, the square faces precess into the mo re stable triangular faces and the result is the tw enty triangles of the icosahedron. The tetrahedron, octahedron and icosahedron are the most stable structures in cosmos because they are all triangulated with no unstable faces composed of squ ares or pentagons, etc. However, something is lost in the precession from c uboctahedron to icosahedron. The nuclear ball of th e cuboctahedron DISAPPEARS as the final close packing of twelve spheres of the icosahedron is un-nucleat ed with no center. This unique behavior also corresponds to our circle of twelve. The cuboctahedron represents the circle of twelve IN LIFE, with Moses, Buddha, Christ and Father C.R. su rrounded by the twelve apostles. IN DEATH, the cent er spiritual leader DISAPPEARS from earthly existence but is survived by the circle of twelve now, in the form of an icosahedron. Therefore, in life, our circle of twel ve exist in form as an cuboctahedron and in death, in form as an icosahedron, stronger, but with no nucleus. To make this correspondence even more clear, R. Ste iner in The Gospel of St. Luke says, \"A whole survey of earth evolution would reveal tha t there are twelve such Bodhisattvas...directing al l earth evolution...if you were to look into the great Spir it-Lodge of the twelve Bodhisattvas you would find in the midst of"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"the twelve there is a thirteenth...There streams fr om the thirteenth what the others have to teach. He is that being from whom wisdom itself streams as very substance. It is quite correct to speak of the twelve Bodhisat tvas in the great Spirit-Lodge grouped around one who is their center. This thirteenth is He whom the ancient Rish is called Vishua Karman, whom Zarathustra called Ahura Mazdao , whom we call the Christ.\" In conclusion, we have answered the question of why the great spiritual leaders of mankind are closed with a circle of twelve. The answer is that they correspond the n ucleated structural model of the cuboctahedron. No other model exists. As a structural model, it relates the heave nly configuration of the twelve Bodhisattva's aroun d the central spiritual sun, so to say, written in the stars on t he celestial background. 10. THE FOUNDING OF THE NEW MYSTERIES All spiritual impulses are founded upon our model o f 12 disciples around a central spiritual sun. A fi nal example to be considered is unique to all of us in the 20th ce ntury, a great time to live and learn Spiritual Sci ence. Once before, on the evening of September 20, 1913, Dr. Steiner laid a foundation Stone (made of copper ) into the hill at Dornach to celebrate the dedication of the completion of the Goetheanum. The holy stone was in the shape of a double pentagonal dodecahedron which he said \" re presents the striving human soul immersed as macroc osm in the microcosm.\" As opposed to the cuboctahedron, wh ich represents a group of spiritual impulses, the s imilar 12- fold dodecahedron, represents \"the cosmic image of the human soul.\" This building burned to the ground on New Years eve, 1922 and remarkably, the original founda tion Stone survived. One year later, at Christmas 1 923, Dr. Steiner held the now famous Christmas Foundation Me eting wherein he rededicated the Anthroposophical S ociety and the new Goetheanum. This monumental event is co nsidered by many as a \"cosmic turning point in time \" and \"a new cosmic age.\" Why this 12-fold shape to serve as the model of the new mysteries ? As discussed in Esoteric Christianity in the DIONYS IUS meditation (supra), the four great mystery stre ams in the Western Tradition merged during the Christmas Found ation Meeting. Previously, those of the East and We st merged in 869 AD by the Parsifal deed when he became the G rail King. The Eastern stream, representing the Bud dhi impulse, consisted in those ancient mysteries of At lantis carried forward by Hibernia-Celtic-Irish Chr istianity. The western impulse, representing the Manas impulse, co nsisted in those ancient mysteries of the post-Atla ntean civilizations of the Hindu, Persian, Chaldean and G reek cultural epochs. The Northern mystery stream was \"polar\" representin g the hidden ego impulse and ancient sun wisdom of the second root race known as Hyperborea. Of all the my stery streams, only this center existed before the Fall, and its wisdom was preserved in the \"traditional wisdom\" so revered by our French intellectuals, Schuon and Gu enon. However, the ego impulse was held back from the fol lowing ages of Lemuria and Atlantis and preserved u ntil Abraham appeared in the third sub-race of the Aryan root race. The Germanic tribes were directed thru the Trudi or Drotten mysteries to Scandinavia and Russia under t he guidance of the bodhisattva Gautama Buddha, inca rnated then as Odin. The Scythians were directed to Easter n Europe under the guidance of the bodhisattva Scyt hianos. The Southern mystery stream represented the preserv ed ancient mystery wisdom of the third root race, L emuria, and came to Europe through the pagan Egyptian priesthoo d, the Old Testament Hebrews and later, thru Christ ianized Rome. The ego impulse first received its fullness w ith Moses, the I AM of the Old testament, and devel oped thru the 3 X 14 generations of the Matthew Gospel until the birth of Christ. Since then, the ego of Christ has been preserved in the Holy Grail chalice. During the Renaissance, the fully developed ego impulse of the Hebrews, pas sed over into the withheld ego impulse of the Celtic and Germanic tribes. This was made possible esoterically by the Rosicrucian impulse and exoterically by the Scholastic teaching s of Albert Magnus and St. Thomas Aquinas. Beginnin g the 5th cultural epoch in 1413 AD, the united ego impulse c ivilized Europe with a Christian economy carried ov er from the Templars. When the dark age of Kali Yuga lifted in 1899, indi viduals from all four mystery streams incarnated on earth to bring forth a united effort to commence the archang el Michael Age (1879). At the Foundation Stone Meet ing in 1923 all four ancient mystery streams united, birth ing forth a new spiritual being, the Michael inspir ed Spiritual Science of Anthroposophy. As such, esoteric Christi anity, represented by Christian Rosencreutz, and ex oteric Christianity, represented by Dr. Steiner, also unit ed to give birth to a new Christian impulse, infuse d with revealed knowledge of karma and reincarnation. Dr. Steiner's LAST ADDRESS given to members of the Society at Michaelmas 1924, further spoke of \"four groups of twelve individuals.\" This archetype of 12, repre sents on the one hand, the impulse of love, as corr esponds to the 12 petalled lotus chakra of the heart and on the ot her hand, the geometric form of all spiritual impul ses. Although not specifically revealed by Dr. Steiner, the four groups of twelve represent the start of four new es oteric impulses replacing the four mystery streams that were merged during the Christmas Foundation Meeting. All of wh ich incarnate in historical time with the commencement of the re-appearence or Second Coming of Christ in the etheric. Predictably, each group will incarnate on earth in a series of 25 years spread over the 20th century. Each group will have been prepared for its task in the sun sphere u nder the guidance of archangel Michael."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The task of each group of 12 will be to raise its g roup consciousness to the corresponding level of it s guiding archangel, wherein the group can absorb the impulse s for each of the four new mysteries. Who and where these centers are located is not known to me, but surely it relates to the incarnation of the three great te achers of the 20th century. With Anthroposophy as the central spiritual being ( that of the arch-angelic being of SOPHIA), the firs t great teacher was Dr. Steiner. The second great teacher is the in carnated Maitreya bodhisattva (previously identifie d as Jeschu ben Pandira in the first century BC) believed to be Val etin Tomberg. Each of these great teachers founded a path of spiritual training to reach its archangel. Steiner began the Esoteric School (1904-1914) and later the Free High School for Spiritual Science. The first fell by the path during WW I and the latter after his death in 1925. Tomberg began his Lord's Prayer course in Amsterdam between 1940-1942, but this was discontinued during WW II. However, his MEDITATIONS ON THE TAROT presents an i ndividualised training for esoteric Christian Hermeticism and exoteric Catholic church practice o f sacraments, penance and prayer. The third great teacher may not become known as a p ublic figure. During the LAST ADDRESS at Michaelmas 1924, Dr. Steiner mentioned the person of John the Baptist incarnating as the German Romantic poet, No valis (1772-1801). From our NAROS meditation, we know of his Old Testament incarnation as Elijah, and previo usly as Phinehas, the son of Aaron the priest In the GOSPEL OF ST. MARK, Dr. Steiner states that \"the soul of John the Baptist, of Elijah, becomes t he group soul of the twelve apostles; it lives and continues to live in the twelve\", of course, after being beh eaded by Herod. Then, \"I have often maintained that the soul of Eli jah-John appeared again in the painter Raphael.\" Th us, we see an evolutionary process of grounding of this great arc hangelic soul, first as the Hebrew group-soul/folk- spirit for the whole nation personified in Elijah; then, as the gr oup soul for the twelve apostles and grounded furth er, in the individual souls of a painter and poet. His next in carnation should be as the third great teacher, gro unding further in the last 1/3 of the 20th century. When Dr. Steiner spoke of the spiritual impulse des cending during the end of the 20th century, he spok e of the Platonic stream that had been held back from incarn ation since the school of Chartres. Between the 12t h century and now, the Aristotelian impulse of Albert Magnus and St. Thomas Aquinas was to lead a Christianised ego impulse into the 20th century where it cumulated in the Spi ritual Science/Anthroposophy of Dr. Steiner. Central to the spiritual impulse of Chartres was th e Celtic cult of the black Virgin, the cathedral it self being built over the grotto of this ancient mystery center. It would seem most logical that the cosmic Christianit y of the Celtic tradition, later revived by the Platonic teachers o f Chartres, would incarnate at the end of the 20th century with an impulse dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. Thus, the third teacher would most likely be a woman teaching the wisdom of Sophia and founding a fourth new mystery stream dedicated to the Most Holy Trinosophia ! In conclusion, our model of the 12 around a spiritu al sun, geometrically expressed in the cuboctahedro n, has historically appeared thru the epochs of civilizati on, guiding the spiritual evolution of mankind and has re-appeared in the 20th century to birth the new mysteries, par ticularly, those of the Sophia Wisdom. ANCIENT TWELVEFOLD WISDOM 1. Adjoining cosmoses Plato says that God geometrizes and we say that he does so according to a twelvefold plan. The Law of Twelve introduces POLARITY into hierarchy of tenfoldness. Each hierarchy of ten is linked above to the higher plane with one pole and each hierarchy is linked below to the lower plane with one pole. Therefore, when one want s to consider relationships between successive planes or hierarch ies, one must look above and below one level. This is what Gurdjieff means when he says, \"The conditions of the action of the laws on each p lane, in each cosmos (hierarchy) are determined by the two adjoining cosmoses, the one above and the one below . Three cosmoses standing next to one another give a complete picture of the manifestation of the laws of the uni verse. One cosmos cannot give a complete picture. T hus, in order to know one cosmos, it is necessary to know the two adjoining cosmoses, the one above and the one belo w the first, one larger and one smaller. Taken together, these t wo cosmoses determine (the laws of) the one that li es between them.\" Now, in speaking of the Law of Twelve, we are reall y speaking of an hierarchy (or cosmos as G. would s ay) of ten, with an upper link or pole binding it to the hierar chies above and the lower link or pole, binding it to the hierarchies below. The number twelve is not a principal in itse lf but a concept that links together the cosmoses b oth above and below. The importance of the Law of Twelve cannot b e underestimated. It is both the end point and culm ination of knowledge of the Laws of Three and Seven and as G. says the beginning point of science and philosophy, in the true meaning of these terms. P.D. Ouspensky also recogni zed the great importance of the teaching of the Law of Twelve which he expressed as his \"period of dimensions.\""},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The reason it is so important is that the study of the Law of Twelve has a synergetic effect in consci ousness. As explained by G., typically a person is conscious of himself in only one cosmos or hierarchy and his sp iritual or scientific investigation proceeds always in the dir ection of only one cosmos. However, if one proceeds in his investigation with the link to the upper and lower cosmoses, then one finds; first, a relation to itse lf in one cosmos; second, a relation to a higher or larger cosmos; an d third, a relation to a lower or smaller cosmos. T hus, one investigates in a threefold synergetic way, effecti ng two other cosmoses simultaneously. For example, I remember while in college the Voyage r mission passing by the planet Jupiter. Now occult ism and in particular a drawing by Robert Fludd relating the b ody of man to the planets, shows that Jupiter has r ulership over, among other organs, the liver. At the same time tha t Voyager started transmitting back to earth pictur es of Jupiter, an American scientist for the first time obtained a n electron photograph of the liver or hepatitis vir us and guess the correspondence! The electron photograph of the live r virus looked like the Voyager space craft and the Voyager space craft looked like the liver virus. Of course, since that time, electron photographs have shown t hat viruses resemble all sorts of space probe craft as well as the geodesic geometric structures discovered by B. Fuller. However this incident conclusively shows the synergetic pri ncipal that scientific investigation into the cosmo s of the planets has a correspondence in the cosmos of the microbes. As above, so below, our isotropic principal operat ing simultaneously in three hierarchies. 2. Geocentric Astronomy Nobody understood this principal of relating hierar chies both above and below better than the ancient occultists. Besides the flat earth theory of the Middle Ages, n o other hoax has been as successfully perpetrated u pon the Christian peoples than the so-called Geocentric the ory as depicted by Ptolemy. We are still taught in school that the ancients thought the planets revolved around the ea rth until the discovery by Copernicus of the helioc entric theory. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, t he earth centric diagrams of Ptolemy reflect the gr eatest wisdom of the ancients showing the earth and mankind in relat ion to (1.) a higher cosmos of the planets; (2.) an even higher cosmos of the zodiac and (3.) relation to the lower cosmos of the elements of fire, air, water and ear th. The earth centric diagrams never intended to show the physica l relationship of the planets but intended to show mankind's spiritual relationship with higher and lower the co smos. Plat No. shows the geocentric system of the ancient s with the earth in the center of both the planetar y cosmos and the zodiacal cosmos. The exoteric explanation given by the Church and modern science is that the ancie nts were really stupid! The esoteric explanation of the occu ltists is that of the path of the human soul during life after death! This is a foundation stone of western occultism, ex tending from Ancient Chaldea, Persia and Egypt, thr ough Greece with Plato and Macrobius (exoterically), through th e Christian mystery steams ending with the Rosicruc ians and finally expressed in Masonic ritual as clearly expl ained by Albert Pike in Morals and Dogma. The geoce ntric spheres interpret as follows: The galaxy crosses the zodiac in the two opposite p oints of Cancer and Capricorn. After death, the sou l ascends through the planetary spheres in the order of Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Dur ing this ascent, the soul is cleansed of its past sins and k arma. A passage must be made between the planetary world and the zodiacal world. The ancients called Capricorn the ' gate of man' through which passage was made from Sa turn to the zodiac on the souls ascent to heaven. One of the an cient purposes of burnt offerings, blood sacrifice and prayer was to establish a relationship with a planetary spirit , whom after death, would guide and help the sacrif icer find this gate quickly and safely. If the soul is fortunate enough to pass through to the spirit-land of the zodiac, it finds itself merg ed into the much higher spiritual beings of the cosmos of stars. The passage of the soul through the twelve houses of t he zodiac is a preparation of the soul for descent back through th e planetary spheres to the next earth life incarnat ion. While the seed for the physical body is down on earth subject to the passions of love making rituals, the spirit ual counterpart is carefully weaving a future etheric and astral body, drawing from the fine matter and forces of the sta rry cosmoses. The etheric body is the template of the physical bo dy and during its composition and preparation for a new earth life, it draws certain forces from each of the zodiacal l ouses. The ancients represented this process in man y ways, most often with the picture of a man impressed against t he zodiac. While the soul is traveling through Arie s, it draws the forces and starry matter necessary to construct the head and face template within the etheric body. Fo r the other constellations, the general pattern is: The melothesia Taurus ----------Neck, throat Gemini ----------Arms, shoulders Cancer ----------Chest, lungs, ribs, breasts Leo --------------Heart, diaphragm, back Virgo ------------Belly, intestines"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Libra ------------Navel, loins, kidneys, butt Scorpio ----------Gonads, bladder Sagittarius -------Hips , thighs Capricorn -------Knees Aquarius ---------Legs, ankles Pisces ------------Feet, toes. When the preparation of the etheric body is complet e, the forces of the moon draws the soul back on it s descent through the planetary world. This passage from the zodiac is through the 'gate of the Gods' located in Cancer. The gate of Capricorn for the ascent and the gate of Ca ncer for the descent were called the \"gates of the Sun\" for two reasons. First, these constellations represented th e tropical points in the suns travel along the plan e of the ecliptic. Second, it was while the soul was in the sun that i t found its spiritual helper (from the earthly sacr ifices) who would travel with the soul as its guardian and helper in passage through the \"gate of Men\". In the descent through the planetary spheres, the s oul approaches each individual planet from the othe r side. What the soul experiences in these spiritual worlds is t he reverse of what the soul would feel from earth w ith physical sight. In addition, the whole future earth life of the soul depends upon the relationship it establish es in these worlds in the course of its gradual descent to earth. For example, upon the planet Mercury, the soul makes it s future connection with a particular nation or people with common language. On Venus, the soul makes its conne ction with a particular family. The last approach is to the mo on sphere where the spiritual beings there are gove rned by that planetary spirit of the original Elohim of the Bibl e known as Jehovah. Here the soul decides its futur e sex. If the soul approaches the earth at the time of a full moon, it will become attracted to a female body. If the app roach is at the time of a new moon, the attraction will be to a mal e body. The ancients have always known as expressed by a thousand variety of fertility symbols, that the moo n forces control sex and generation. This entire process has always been likened to the descent of spirit (from the zodiac or heaven) into matter (the moon and earth) and the corresponding ascent of mat ter into spirit. (See diagram on Page 70.) The soul made of pure and celestial substance descends into the various d egrees of matter ending in an earth manifestation a s mineral, plant, animal or man. Thereafter, the soul ascends to the primitive condition in the heavens after pur ging and cleansing itself by travel through the planetary wo rlds from the effects of its contact with the earth elements of fire, air, water and earth. 3. Chaldean Calander The other drawing in THE CHALDEAN CALENDER , shows the Ancient Chaldean order of the planets in the zodiacal houses in relation to the ancient platonic elements of fire, air, water and earth. "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" From this table can be derived first, the order of the days of the week, based upon the occult princip le that the first hour of the day is influenced by its planetary name sake. Thus, Saturn = Saturday Jupiter = Thursday Mars = Tuesday Sun = Sunday Venus = Friday Mercury = Wednesday Moon = Monday Beginning with Saturn on Saturday, the first hour i s governed by Saturn, and the remaining hours are g overned by each successive planet for one hour. Thus, 3 x 7 = 21 hours and in a twenty-four hour day, this divide s out with three extra hours. Saturn would rule the lst, 8th, 15th a nd 22st hour, respectively. Then counting three hou rs extra as, 23 = Jupiter, 24 = Mars, the first hour of the next day would be the 25th hour or Sunday! Likewise, the 25t h hour of the next consecutive planetary day would be (+3) the mo on or Monday. The order and names as the days of th e week are consistent throughout all cultures."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Secondly, from the Chaldean calendar can be derived the weeks of the year. An ancient tradition was pr eserved by Epiphanius (the Fourth Century Christian polemic hi storian) when he described the birthday of Christ a s follows. \"The Savior was born in the forty-second year of Au gustus, King of Rome...and on the 6th day of Januar y after thirteen days of winter solstice and the increase o f light and day...For it needs must have been that this should be a figure of our Lord, Jesus Christ Himself, and of hi s twelve disciples, who made up the number of the t hirteen days of the increase of the light.\" Epiphanius would count the first year of Augustus ( Octavian) from the date of the death of Julius Caes ar at 44 B.C. and thereby placing the birthdate of Christ in the year of 2 B.C. This birth date is in close accord w ith the Canonical date of Christ, which custom began with Dionysius E xiguus. So why would this very orthodox Roman Canonical his torian set Christmas on January 6th instead of Dece mber 25th, the traditional exoteric date? The reason was that he was attempting to preserve an ancient esot eric tradition that was lost with the Reformation of the Roman cal endar! That the ancient Jews knew the precise length of th e solar year is demonstrated by the genera of the w ord Oriens (meaning spiritual east) as 0 = 6, R = 100, I = 10, E = 5, N = 50, and S = 200 equals 371 or 365 (days ) plus 6 (hours). Now, approximately 47 B.C. a Babylonian Je w named Sosigenes sold this secret of the length of the solar year to Julius Caesar. At that time the exoteric ca lendar was so far deteriorated that January 1st wou ld have fallen on October 13th. Caesar reformed the calendar to confo rm it with the seasons again by inserting two extra months, one of 33 days and one of 34 days between November and December of that year and adding a 23 day month to the preceding February. The extra 90 days would fix the next calendar year to 365 days and a leap year eve ry fourth year. This arrangement has lasted to modern times, and is known as the Julian Calendar. The problem came when trying to set the beginning o f the solar Julian year after abolishing the old Lu nar year of the Romans. The ancient esoteric sources would have beg un the new year on either of the seasonal solstices or equinoxes that coincided with a new moon. For examp le, if Caesar desired to start the new year at the time of the winter solstice, then he would have waited until a new moon occurred on December 21st or 22nd and call ed that day the \"Calends of January\". However, either he did no t know the esoteric wisdom or he couldn't wait. In that year, the solstice fell on December 24th and the new moon was seven days later. The full month of December at th at time had thirty days so the calends of January was set seven days after December 24th or January 1st as we now know it. Thus, the new year begins on January 1st and not on the day of the winter solstice. In retrospect, Cae sar got less than what he paid for, only some of the ancient wisdom, not all of it! After the birth of Christ, early Christians wanted to preserve a tradition reflecting the true birthda y of Christ in relation to the true esoteric calendar year. The an cient wisdom taught that a secret astronomical cycl e begins with the first full moon or 14 days after the new moon f alls coincident with a winter solstice. Since, in t he first Julian year, winter solstice fell on December 24th and aft er the month was extended from 30 to 31 days, the f ull moon would have occurred on January 6th (actually 13 day s in this particular cycle). For this reason Epipha nius and the early Christians set the esoteric birth date of Chr ist on January 6th, and celebrated what has come to be called the Feast of Epiphany. The Chaldean calendar shows a third astronomical re lationship, this one in relation to our \"great Plat onic Year\" cycle of 25,920 years. (See page 58-59.) Each year as the sun passes on its yearly cycle of 365 days t hrough each zodiacal house, it returns to its starting point, t he vernal or spring equinox. As previously discusse d, this point precesses one degree every seventy-two years and th rough one sign of the zodiac every 2,160 years. Thi s is our familiar Messianic cycle. Thus, the vernal equinox stands in one zodiacal house for a period of 2,160 years. The ancients called these periods an \"age\" of the z odiac and also called these periods a \"religious ag e\" because each age was accompanied by a particular Messiah. (See p ages 53-54, for the ages of the Rishis, Zoroaster, Hermes, Christ, etc.) Hence, each religious age was derived from its zodiacal sign such as the Taurean Age, Pi scean Age, Aryan Age, etc. Because of this relationship, the s ymbols of all religions have an astronomical basis, the key to which is the zodiacal house. For example, during th e Taurean Age, the bull was sacred as depicted by t he Egyptians as Apis, and the Persians as Mithras and to Aaron a nd the Jews in the desert as the golden calf. In th e Piscean Age, the fish was the symbol of deity as described by St . Augustine, if you join the first letters of the G reek words for \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior\" they will form t he word FISH, which the Fisher of Men fed the multi tudes on Mount . There is no need to elaborate on the astron omical basis for religious symbolism here, but it i s worthy to respect the incredible effort made by the 19th Cent ury occult writers such as Godfrey Higgens in Anaca lypis, Albert Pike in Morals and Dogma and the Madame H.P.B. in I sis Unveiled. They removed the veil of hypocrisy fr om the so-called mysteries of the Church and showed the tr ue pagan mystery cult sources of all great religion s. The religious zodiacal ages are explained in as man y different ways as there are different cultures. H owever, the Chaldean calendar is uniformly the astronomical sou rce of all occult astrology. As only one example he re is the Rosicrucian system."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"In his lecture series entitled, Ancient Myths, R. S teiner described the relationship between the Chald ean calendar and the cultural epochs for the Post-Atlantean or F ifth (Aryan) root race as follows: 1. For the Ancient Indian or first sub-root race, t he vernal (spring) equinox of the sun was in Cancer , and the corresponding planet was the moon. The three decant s (not shown in the calendar) were Venus, Mercury a nd Moon. 2. For the Ancient Persian or second sub-root race, the vernal equinox was in Gemini and the correspon ding planet was Mercury. The three decants were Jupiter, Mars a nd Sun. 3. For the Ancient Egyptian-Chaldean or third sub-r ace, the vernal equinox was in Taurus and the corre sponding planet was Venus. The three decants were Mercury, M oon and Saturn. 4. For the Ancient Greek-Roman or fourth sub-race, the vernal equinox was in Aries and the correspondi ng planet was Mars. The three decants were Mars, Sun and Venu s. 5. For the fifth and present sub-race, the vernal e quinox is in Pisces and the corresponding planet is Jupiter. (sic, Saturn?) The three decants are Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. Following the Chaldean calendar, the next cultural epoch or sub-race will stand in the house of Aquari us. As to the different characteristics the forces of the zodiaca l houses, planetary houses and decants effect on cu ltural evolution, the subject is very confused and left to the specul ations of astrology. Finally, an interesting and maybe the most revealin g correspondence of religious astronomical symbolis m is found in the four Cardinal signs of the zodiac. Back in C hapter 1, page 19, reference is made to the twelve fold nature of the zodiac as a result of the efforts of the Cherub im. This effort was expressed through the four fixe d signs or Cardinal signs as Taurus (Bull); Leo (Lion); Scorpi o (Eagle); and Aquarius (Water-Man). The ancient wi sdom of all cultures recognized their significance, from the vi sion of Ezekiel in the Old Testament to the Revelat ion of St. John in the New Testament. Because of their universal cu ltural significance, it is fair to conclude that th e four cardinal signs of the zodiac hid the secret name of God, whi ch name was known by all ancient cultures, not only the Jews. Taking the numbers from the Chaldean calendar for t hese four signs we have, 2 (Taurus) + 5 + 8 + 11 eq uals 26, the number of Jehovah! 4. The Twelve Degrees of Freedom The ancient wisdom teaches that there are six prima ry forces in nature which in their unity is represe nted by the seventh or the Astral Light. The Quabbalists and He rmetic philosophers called the Astral Light the hea venly or celestial virgin. T. Subba Row in his article, The Twelve Signs of the Zodiac, states that in the Brah man Esotericism, the sixth sign of the zodiac, Virgo re presented the virgin and the six primary forces in nature which he terms: (1) Parasakti; (2) Jnanasakti; (3) Icchasakt i; (4) Kriyasakti; (5) Kundalinisakti; and (6) Matr kasakti. Our 20th Century spokesman for the geometry of the ancient wisdom is R. Buckminster Fuller. He also re cognizes the occult law of the six primary forces in nature which he translates into six vectors of freedom as represented in the six edges of the tetrahedron. In Synergetics 2 he states, \"There are six basic motions in Universe. All of th em are positive and negative; active and passive. T he first five are individually experienceable and popularly familiar; the last - precession - is less popularly familiar : -Spin: Spinning is horizontal or vertical axial rot ation. Spinnability has to be totally independent o f the system's local surface transformation. -Orbit: No path of travel may be 180-degree linear in a multibodied, gravity-cohered, omnimotional Uni verse. The initial reality of all travel is orbital as a compo site resultant of all tensive restraints. As the Su n's pull on the Earth produces orbiting, orbiting electrons produce direc tional field pulls. As 99.99 percent of the bodies in motion in physical Universe are operating orbitally, orbiting must be thought of as normal. (Spinning and orbiti ng together is dancing.) Orbits are regenerative feedback circuits . -Inside-out: Anything with a hole in it turns insid e-out. The tetrahedron turns inside-out through any of its four space-windows faces. Kissing humans turn partially inside-out as they \"pucker\" their lips. -Expansion-contraction: Expansion is radiant diverg ence, and contraction is gravitational convergence. -Torque: Torque and counter torque are local twists in which one pole spins right and the other pole s pins left. -Precession: Precession is the effect of bodies in motion on other bodies in motion in interrelationsh ip patterns of other than 180 degrees. Reactions and resultants ar e precessional, bringing about orbits and not strai ght lines. For instance, the effect of the Sun traveling around ou r galaxy center at 700,000 miles per hour upon the Earth cotraveling with the Sun; the precessional effect o f gravity between the two is an effect at 90 degree s to the Sun pull, which makes the Earth both spin and orbit around th e Sun.\" Now these six basic motions as positive total six a nd as negative total six more, for a total of twelv e motions or vectors of restraint. R.B.F. invented the term \"twe lve degrees of freedom\" to describe these twelve ex ercises of the six motions. Together, they produce structure becau se they hold a thing or system together into one in tegral unit. There is no gray area here. If there is one less ve ctor of restraint, the thing will change its shape."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"These six systemic interrestraints (manifest in dua lity, forwards and backwards direction) produce str ucture and the minimum structure is the tetrahedron. Once we have this minimum system, then we have a thing that can rotate, orbit, torque, etc. Now, any unity once produced is in itself a potenti al nucleus. But we now know that to become a prime nucleus, the system needs twelve similar units closed packed in equal distance from the center. This arrangement, a s we saw on page in relation to the zodiac and central sun, loc ks the prime nucleus inside. 5 . THE ANCIENT ELEMENTS The ancient wisdom teaches that the four elements r epresent conditions or states of matter. Earth mean t everything in a solid state. Water meant everything in a fluid state. Air meant everything in a gaseous state. Th ese conditions are recognized by modern science. Fire, however, is not recognized by modern science as a condition of matter. In any chemistry textbook, the equations of chemica l transformations never include the element of heat or fire. Fire is only relative degrees of atomic motion. The essential quality of fire is ubiquitous. It per meates earth and warms it. It permeates water and a ir and warms it. It is the actual cause of the chemical transformati on from solid to liquid to gas and back again. It i s the background or ether for molecular change in the same way light is the ether for making objects visible. Fire is a trinity of flame, light and smoke and a b ridge between the physical and spiritual (meta-phys ical) worlds. From the burning flame, light and smoke is produced . The light ascends to the spiritual world. The smo ke descends to the material world. The ancient wisdom teaches that smoke creates the m aterial, physical world. In the opaque turbidity of smoke reside elemental spirits or beings. Smoke is already in th e chemical state of air or gas, thus the act of fla me creates the first state of matter. Air is condensed or densified warm th from the original condition of the flame. As the air condenses, it becomes a liquid and as the liquid condenses, it becomes solid matter. In this way there is an evol ution of the states of matter from smoke to air, to gas to solid matter. This also tells us something about the con secutive order of evolution. Air existed before liquid and liquid exi sted before earth. This order, long recognized as a n elementary occult exercise, is obvious is our planetary system . The sun is fire, the atmosphere is air, the ocean s are water and the continents are solid matter. The key to the evolution of the states of matter is the smoke in which elemental beings of fire on sal amanders are trapped. This process is the foundation for the occ ult law of the descent of spirit into matter and th e ascent of matter into spirit, in seven stages. At each stage of dens ification, an elemental being is trapped. In the el ement of air is trapped the elementals called sylphs. In the elemen t of water is trapped the elementals called undines and in the element of earth is trapped the elementals called g nomes. The higher spiritual hierarchies send down t hese elementals that live in fire and through the transf ormation of smoke, trap them in air, water and eart h, thereby creating our three states of matter on the descendi ng curve. On the ascending curve of matter into spirit, the o pposite occurs. As earth is transformed by fire int o the liquid state, the trapped elementals are released. Likewise, as w ater is transformed by fire into air, elementals ar e released. The elementals that are trapped on the descending curve are released on the ascending curve. The transform ation of day and night by elementals is a microcosmic event corr esponding to this macrocosmic event. The original teaching of elementals come from the H oly Rishis of ancient India and is preserved in the sacred texts of the Vedas and Bhagavad-Gita. For the Hindus, the king of the gnomes is called Kshiti; the king of t he Undines is Varuna; the king of the sylphs is Vayu and the king of fire is Agni. In the ancient Persian epoch, these teachings were recorded in the sacred text of the Zend-Avesta and preserved in the cult of Mithras, esoterically the constellation of Taurus. The founder of this cultural epoch, Zar athustra, is commonly referred to as the fire magician. Zarathus tra is said to have been the son of Vesta,(the wife of Noah) and Oromasis, the king of the fire salamanders. For thi s reason an eternal flame is kept burning in the te mples of the Magi. In the ancient Chaldean epoch, the four element are grouped in triads through the zodiac. To fire belo ngs, Aries, Leo and Sagittarius; to air belongs Gemini, Libra and A quarius; to water belongs Cancer, Scorpio and Pisce s; to earth belongs Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn. In the Chaldean-Hebrew Quabbalah preserved as cerem onial magic to this day, we find the names of the f our elements and their dominions. Ruler King Angel Direction FIRE Djin Seraph Aral South AIR Ariel Paralda Chassan East WATER Tharsis Nichasa Taliahad West"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"EARTH Kerub Ghob Phorlakh North Each element also has its ruling archangel and seph iroth in the Tree of Life. In addition, each elemen t works through the four fixed signs of the zodiac: air-man-Aquariu s; fire-lion-Leo; water-eagle-Scorpio and earth-bul l-Taurus. Ultimately, knowledge of the elementaries living in the four elements led to selfish ceremonial magic and Theurgyvas personified in Iamblichus. He writes, \"t he gods, the angels and the daimons as well as the souls, may be summoned through evocation and prayer. But when, du ring the theurgic operations, a mistake is made, be ware! Do not imagine that you are communicating with benefic ent divinities, who have answered your Ernest praye r, no, for they are bad daimons, only under the guise of good ones! For the elementaries often clothe themselves with the similitude of the good, and assume a rank very much superior to that they really occupy. Their boastin g betrays them.\" Obviously, theurgy, is the denigration of the ancie nt mystery knowledge similar to what Steiner calls the betrayal of the Vulcan mysteries in Atlantean times. Fortunatel y, at the beginning of the Greek-Roman fourth cultu ral epoch, Plato clothed the ancient mystery knowledge in symb ols of rational thought. At the age of fourth-nine, Plato was initiated on t he alter of the Bembine tablet of Isis in the great pyramid of Cheops. After death on the wooden tao cross, three days buried in the granite sarcophagus, he was rais ed to the glory of Osiris in the rising sun. Is it strange he would say that fire is a pyramid? THE TIMAEUS Plato records the ancient wisdom is his TIMAEUS. Fi rst, he recognizes the serial order of the descent of spirit into matter. \"Let us now therefore distribute the four s orts of things which we have generated into fire, e arth, water and air... To fire, the most easily movable form; the s econd according to the generation to air; that whic h is third to water...and the most immovable to earth.\" Second, he recognized that great occult law of dens ification, \"nature abhors a vacuum\". The descending curve is contraction, the ascending curve is expansion. The tendency towards condensation thrusts smaller parti cles into the interstices of the larger, the lesser divide the gr eater and the greater unite the lesser. Changes in size cause changes in space and this inequality affords a perpetual mo tion, both at the present and at all time in the fu ture. \"The circulation then of the universe, since it com prehends the different sorts of things in its circu mference, being of a circular form, and naturally desiring to pass int o union with itself, compresses all things within i ts spacious receptacle, and does not suffer a void place anywhe re to subsist. On this account, fire in the most em inent degree penetrates through all things.\" Third, he recognized the proportional structure of matter, fire to air, as air is to water as water is to earth. For example, \"two bodies of fire coalesce into one form of air\". Or, \"when air becomes vanquished and sepa rated into parts, then from two wholes and a half one form of water is produced\". Represented geometrically, one air particle is equal to twenty equilateral triangles. This may sep arate into two particles of air (eight equilateral triangles each) and one particle of fire (four equilateral triangles); thus 20 = 8 + 8 + 4 equilateral triangles. The cons tancy of these proportions corresponds to the fixed proportion by weight discovered by John Dalton as the basis of mo dern chemistry. Lastly, he recognized the corpuscular structure of matter. To each of the elements he assigned a geome trical shape, the common denominator of each being a scalene tria ngle. To the element of fire he designated \"the sol id form of the pyramid is the element and seed of fire\". For P lato, the four states of matter are regular stereom etrical forms, inherently divisible as are our modern atoms of Boh r and Rutherford. As the polyhedra are split, their equilateral and scalene triangles disperse into spirit, energy and potentiality. As the triangles re-combine, the form of matter returns to actuality in regular, fixed patterns. Alfred North Whitehead remarked, \"the Timaeus of Pl ato and the Scholium of Newton are the two statemen ts of cosmological theory which have had the chief influe nce on Western thought. The Timaeus...conveys profo und truth...Newton would have been surprised at the mod ern quantum theory and at the dissolution of quanta into vibrations; Plato would have expected it.\" GEOMETRY That R. Buckmister Fuller would recognize the pyramid or tetrahedron as the corpuscle of fire goes without saying. In SYNERGETICS I he discusses the c hemical bonding of the tetrahedron and the states o f matter as follows. The single bonded tetrahedra system is similar to a pin joint. All tetrahedra are joined to each other by only one vertex and as a result, each corpuscle can rotate i n any direction around the single vertex. This corr esponds to the compressible and loan distributing behavior of gase s."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The double bond tetrahedra system is like a hinge j oint. Two vertexes of each tetrahedra are joined al ong a single axis, an edge length. Each corpuscle can rotate per pendicularly about an axis. This demonstrates the l oad distributing but non-compressible behavior of liqui ds. The triple bond tetrahedra system is similar to a f ixed joint. It occurs when three vertexes of each t etrahedra come together on a face. This close packing, triple-bond ed, fixed end arrangement corresponds to the format ional and continuing behavior of crystalline molecular compou nds, or solid earth. In addition, there as a fourth bond that gives the solid-earth element two classes, the first being th e crystalline class and the second being the diamond-metal class. The f our or quadruple bond occurs when all four vertexes of the tetrahedra are congruent. This is maximum densifica tion of the descending arc and occurs for example, when soft triple-bonded carbon convents into the hard closest -packing quadrivalence of diamond. In metals we also see this quadrivalence, but not i n the vertexes, but in congruent centers of gravity . X-ray diffraction studies by Linus Pauling showed all met als to be tetrahedronally close packed interlinking the gravitational centers of the compounded atoms. The bonds are formed mid-edge and mid-face and demonstr ate the superior strength and hardness of metals.

The spirits that live in the ancient elements are b ound to a sub-physical earth evolution. The physica l earth evolution in this Fourth globe of this fourth round is monadi c progression from mineral, plant, animal and man. In the supra- physical or astral evolution is spiritual progressi on continuing from the three previous planetary evo lutions of Old Saturn, Old Sun and Old Moon, through the angels, a rchangels and archai, etc. On the chain of life bel ow the physical earth evolution and the spiritual astral e volution lie the three elementary conditions. Steiner says that the three elementary conditions a re formed from the detached astral substance of the group souls of animals. Each animal species is nourished by a grou p soul existing on the astral plane. When an indivi dual animals dies, the group soul or group ego remains alive, an d replenishes the species with a new individual mem ber, similar to loosing a hair and then a new hair grows in its place. When an animal species becomes extinct, ther e is no death. Death only occurs for humans between the Lemurian a nd sixth epoch. The extinct group soul metamorphose s into a higher spiritual being, such as when an archangel a scends into archai. "},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"A situation does occur when a whole series of anima ls draw too much out of the group soul. In the norm al situation, the part that remains over becomes detached from th e group soul and leads as separate isolated life as an elementary. Thus, from animals who live in the air, arise sylph s. From animals who live in the water, arise undine s and from animals who live on earth, arise gnomes. In a parti cular situation where the animals have carried thei r development (such as the ape) too far, have developed an ego or fourth principle similar to that of a human, they cannot return to the group soul and live an elemental existence as s alamanders. These elementary beings actually enter the human ph ysical body and help repair and maintain it. In the food we eat and the air we breathe, enter the elementals which transform foodstuffs through digestion into the thr ee bodily humors of chyle (intestinal fluid), lymph and blood . In a very direct sense, these three body humors i mpregnated with elementals control the human organism. The gla ndular system is an expression of the etheric body, the nervous system is an expression of the astral body and the ego finds its expression in the blood. Likewise, th e circulation of the intestinal food fluids are connected to the eth eric body, the lymph fluid is connected to the astr al body and the blue carbon rich blood is transformed into red bloo d by fire elementals when combined with oxygen in t he lungs. This intimate relationship between our physical, et heric, astral and ego bodies being sustained and no urished by the elementals arriving in our food stuffs has both a p ositive and negative aspect. It is good in the sens e that a nervous system cannot function without astral beings active in it nor can a blood system circulate without ego -beings also active in it. At night, these beings cooperate to r estore, rebuild and replenish the strength of our v arious bodies that has been spent during the day. However, to the extent that the ego does NOT contro l the life processes, the elementals control the li fe processes for us. Human evolution is the development of the highe r trinity of Manas, Buddhi and Atma, and this occur s as the ego gains control and mastery over the lower quaternary of physical body, etheric body and astral body. Th at portion of the astral body transformed by the ego is called Ma nas, that portion of the etheric body transformed b y the ego is called Buddhi and that portion of the physical body transformed by the ego is called Atma. The portion of the lower quaternary under the control of the ego is forever ours, increasing through each incarnation. However, that portion that is untransformed is forever theirs, and in thi s sense the elementals actually control life proces ses of our lower quaternary. THE LAMB IN ARIES. We know that these elemental beings enter into man during his entire life and remain there imprisoned. The issue is whether or not they can be released at death. In SPIRITUAL HIERARCHIES, Steiner says, \"When a per son goes through the gate of death, there is a dist inction between these elemental begins who merely entered i nto him and have not been led back to the higher el ements, and those who, through man's activity, have been guided back to their former condition. Those who have not been transformed have gained nothing by wandering from t he outer world into man; others are able to return to their former condition after man's death. During life on earth man builds a cross-road for elementals. When man has gone through life in the spiritual worlds and returns in a subsequent incarnation through the gate of birth , all elemental beings whom he did not release, accompany him into physical existence. Those whom he releases do not a ccompany him any longer; they return to their original condi tion.\" These interplay of the elementals during earth evol ution takes place in the four cosmic arenas of man, earth, moon and sun. In the sphere of man, there is the bewitch ment of Lucifer and Ahriman (discussed supra). In t he sphere of the earth, elementals live in the processes that tr ansform day and night. A person who is \"creative, a ctive, diligent and productive\" contributes to day time elementals in their ascending phase. However, a person who is lazy and unproductive does not transform those elementals of the night into productive forces of the day light. Similarly, there are good and bad elementals that d well in the waxing and waning of the moon sphere. A person's mood, whether content and cheerful or angry and dep ressed, determines the release or entrapment of the se spirits. Lastly, there are the elements that live in and tra nsform the summer and winter seasons within the sun sphere over the course of the year. Certain elementals become t rapped during the winter and only through human dev otion and spiritual understanding, are they released at death ."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" Thus, in addition to the elementals that become tra pped inside man arising from the consumption of foo dstuffs, there also are elementals that become trapped inside man arising from the planetary evolution of earth, moon and sun. It is important to distinguish the twofold effect upon pe rsonal and planetary evolution. First, as concerns personal evolution, each individ ual human carries the karma of these elementals wit hin themselves. Those elementals that are transformed a nd released are themselves guided to a higher stage of being and can participate in planetary evolution in the earth , moon and sun spheres. However, those that remain trapped are released at death but return to ourselves during th e next incarnation. Second, as concerns planetary evolution, humanity i s that fulcrum through which the elementals of natu re must pass on the ascending curve of matter into spirit. The L aw of Seven teaches that at every level in the spir itual hierarchies, from the Seraphim down to the elementals, there are ascending and descending forces. In the earth sphe re there are the ascending forces of daylight and descending for ces of nighttime. In the moon sphere, there are asc ending forces in the waxing of the moon and descending forces in the waning of the moon. In the sun sphere, there ar e ascending forces in the summer season and descending forces i n the winter season. For each sphere of planetary e volution, there are elementals trapped in the descending forc es that need to be liberated and released into the ascending forces. In each sphere, mankind is the crucible in which th is transformation either occurs or does not occur. Ultimately, the heavenly ladder of these lines of f orces converge upon the zodiac. This is the cosmic secret expressed in Ezekiel's wheel, first made exoteric b y Hargrave Jennings in the ROSICRUCIANS and later b y, Madame H.P. Blavatsky in ISIS UNVEILED. However, it was Steiner in his lecture series entit led, THE INFLUENCE OF SPIRITUAL BEING UPON MAN, (1908) who explains the mystery. Descending forces come from the five constellations of Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and P isces. Ascending forces come through Aries, Taurus, Gemini , Cancer, Leo, Virgo and Libra. \"The forces which a re in the descending phase of evolution have first to pass th rough man and within him to attain the stage at whi ch they too can become ascending forces.\" The purpose of this earth evolution is to develop t he fourth principle or ego. To the extent that mank ind transforms the descending forces through his ego into ascendin g forces, the group ego of humanity participates in planetary evolution through the Jupiter, Venus and Vulcan Man vantaras. If mankind accomplishes its task, during the Vulcan Manvantara, our earth will evolve into a sun and ou r sun will evolve into a member of the Zodiac, whit h Christ as our leader. Christ as a Spirit of Wisdom is a seven principled being, whose lowest member extends down to Libra an d whose highest member extends upwards to Aries. In the Tab le of forces (supra) the lowest member for man is i n Pisces and his highest member, Atma, extends upwards to Virgo. It is through the ego that the higher principles d evelop, so as man evolves up towards Atma in Libra, so does the C hrist Being look with his microcosmic ego upwards t o the constellation of Aries. Hence, the occult designati on of the Mystical Lamb. As described in THE GOSPEL OF ST. LUKE, Christ is the center of the lodge of twelve B udhisattvas directing earth evolution. This is an e arthly PREFIGURATION of the cosmic arrangement of Christ b eing spread into the Zodiac. As can be seen in the drawing from an early Christi an mosiac, Christ is also referred to as the sacrif ical lamb, seen here with a sword penetrating the body of a lamb (e soterically Aries). "},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" The sacrifice of Christ is that he held back or rem ained behind in his own macrocosmic evolution twice , once during the Old Sun Manvantara and again during the Old Moo n Manvantara. Christ developed his ego or fourth pr inciple outside earth evolution and for this reason He was not directly connected with earth evolution, as are the Spirits of Form of the sun who are directly connected with ear th evolution. Christ sacrificed his macrocosmic ego so that mankind could develop its microcosmic ego during th e earth evolution. Because He remained behind, the greater sacrifice was that He did not take the opportunity to develop his fifth, sixth and seventh principles. Because He united with earth evolution, mankind will evolve wi th Him during the Jupiter, Venus and Vulcan Manvant aras. THE LAMB IN THE SECOND SEAL In our early Christian mosiac , we see the lamb in the center surrounded by the four beasts of the Apo calypse. Being an archetypal symbol, it relates on many levels, fr om correspondances with the ancient four elements t o the cardinal signs of the zodiac. What is this symbolism of the sacrifical lamb as the second seal used by St. John ? Dr Steiner in his APOCALYPSE OF ST. JOHN (1908)expl ains that mankind did not always have a individual soul. During the first four sub-races of the fourth Atlan tean root race, mankind shared a common group soul, similar to the way plants and animals share a common group sou l for each species. Technically, these group souls are offspring of the second angelic hierarchy. These gr oup souls are in fact a common group EGO (as fifth microcosmic principle) that live on the astral plane. In the kingdoms of nature, for minerals, plants and animals, the group ego has not descended into the physical plane. For mankind, the descent of the macrocosmic ego occ ured during the fifth sub-race during the epoch of Libra, the scales. As shown on the previous plate of Ezekiel's Wheel (esoteric), Libra is the midpoint of the asc ending and descending forces of the zodiac. Prior to this time , up thru Virgo, the forces were not balanced, the descending forces out weighing the ascending forces. With the entry of the cosmic ego into individual men during the Libra epoch, the ego can henceforth participate in the fo rces of the zodiac. Now, the scales have tipped and there are seven ascending forces and only five descending forces. T his is the exact meaning of what was said earlier a bout the descending forces in evolution must first pass thru mankind. Prior to the descent of the cosmic ego into the mic rocosmic individual ego, there had to be an evoluti onary development in successive stages on the physical pl ane. Each of the four beasts represent a sub-race o f Atlanteans: 1. Tmoahl race bull cult 2. Tlvatli race lion cult 3. Toltec race eagle cult 4. Turanian race man cult"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The BULL represents the perfect animal of digestion as reflected in the abdomen of the human. He conve rts earthly forces into spiritual forces and when he dies, his forces return to the earth, to renew the earth. The LION represents the perfect animal of the breas t as reflected in the thorax of the human. Here the re is an equilibrium between breathing and blood circulation . Digestion is relatively quick, giving a balance b etween breathing and the heartbeat. Notice the smile on th e lion or cat after dinner. The EAGLE represents the perfect animal of the head as reflected in the head of man. It lives so much on breathing, that the other processes of digestion and circulati on are almost non-existant. All these beasts take earth forces and transform th em into spiritual forces. The animals represent the three fold human organism of head-chest-abdomen. Together, in unity, they represent the fourth beast, the perfect man. In man, the cow-bull is the earth animal and evolution ary perfection of digestion in the abdomen. It belo ngs to the sphere of moon-mercury-venus. The lion is the evolutionary perfection of breathin g and circulation and is represented in the sun sph ere. The eagle is the evolutionary perfection of head forces and is r epresented in the sphere of mars-jupiter-saturn. Th us, the three fold human organism is represented in the three bea sts and in the three planetary spheres. Also, these three spheres are represented in humanity as a whole, with the Ea st and Orient as the cow-bull; Central Europe as th e lion and Western Europe and America as the eagle. Now, each of these four beasts has a corresponding group soul that guided these four evolutionary stag es. In the APOCALYPSE of St. John, each beast was a symbol of each group soul. In the fifth sub-race, during the time of the sun's precessional cycle in Libra, the seed of the individual ego was laid and these typical etheric f orms disappeared. The lamb in our mosiac is a symbol of the fifth gro up soul which will exist throughout the entire manv antara. As a whole, it represents the higher trinity in man of M anas-Buddhi-Atma. In our old Pythagorean symbolism of the lower quaternary, as a square of the lower four pri nciples: physical, etheric, astral and ego; the lam b represents the higher triangle. This is an eternal symbol because it represents the higher triangle as MACROCOSMIC PRINCIPLES. The cosmic ego that descended during th e Libra epoch was in fact the macrocosmic ego of th e Christ being. HE too has only evolved his fourth principle , his ego, and the grand purpose of the Divine Plan of this earth manvantara is for humanity as a whole to evolve its fourth ego principle. Because of HIS sacrifice, Ch rist will share in our future evolution during the next three manva ntaras. During the Jupiter manvantara, on the fourth globe of the fourth round, He will again come to earth an d give mankind his manas principle which HE is now evolvin g. Likewise, during the Venus manvantara, on the fo urth globe of the fourth round, He will again come to ea rth to give us his Buddhi principle. Because Christ has united with earth evolution, as He evolves His fifth, sixt h and seventh principles on a macrocosmic scale (ou r higher group souls) He will successively give these to all manki nd as microcosmic principles, descending from the e ther as the cosmic ego did during acient Atlantis. Granted, one might argue that certain people have e volved their higher principles to a certain degree, and this is good. Certainly, a genius has developed his manas a nd a saint his buddhi principles. However, this ind ividual microcosmic development should not be confused with the Divine Plan of each manvantara. The developmen t of these instances only occur through the assistance o f Luciferic beings of an angelic nature, which beca use they did not complete the evolution of their higher principl es during the last Old Moon manvantara, must now de velop them personally thru us as individuals. So, we may have glimpses or even long years of these higher princip les because the Lunas Pitris who temporarily live within us, bu t the higher qualities are not yet grounded in huma nity as a whole, they are not yet born in us as the ego princ iple is already seeded into the fetus. This is a ta sk for future manvantaras. The group soul of the Christ being, th e active intelligence of Manas, will not descend up on humanity as a whole until the Jupiter manvantara, and when i t does, it will be a further gift of the Christ, a gift of His being. THE ATLANTEAN BEAST Further symbolism in the APOCALYPSE of St. John is reflected in the beast with 7 heads. In the ancient mysteries, each typical animal form was represented as a HEAD. This is why Old Testament visions at the level of the first angelic hierarchy saw one beast with four heads. Th e vision of Ezekiel is such an example. When animal -man passed over to the human form in the fifth sub-race , he left behind the four animal head forms. In add ition to the four animal heads, there are three more, reflecting the 5th, 6th and 7th sub-races of the Atlantean ro ot race. Thus,"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"there were in fact seven heads in the fourth root r ace and this is why the beast in chapter 13 of the APOCALYPSE has seven heads. As a symbol of the fifth root race , the beast of seven heads represents the animal na ture in mankind which must be evolved and passed over in the future . The horns of the beast with seven heads represent, in the ancient mystery wisdom, the various organs i n the physical human body. Each physical organ is a condensation f rom the corresponding etheric spiritual organ, know n as chakras. What is called a horn is the organ in the physical body which evolved from the corresponding etheric chakra as an archetype. For example, the human hear t reached its perfection during the second sub-race of the so- called lion cult and the heart is called the horn o f the etheric lion head. So too for the bull and ea gle. At the end of the fourth sub-race of Atlantis, mank ind had four heads and four horns. After the descen t of the individual ego in the fifth sub-race, these horns e volved a male-female duality and nature and became double. Thus, at the end of the seventh sub-race, at the time of the Biblical flood, the etheric body of man was rep resented by seven heads and ten horns, one horn each for the fi rst four sub-races (4) and two each for the next th ree epochs (6), which equals 10. For our seer of Patmos looking bac kwards in time over the evolution of the Atlantean root race, he saw a beast with seven heads and ten horns as descr ibed in chapter 13., Looking forward in time over the fifth root race, o ur seer of Patmos had a vision of evolution with th e Christ principle within mankind. The symbol of this \"Chris t within' is the lamb of the second seal. It is the end of the evolution of the fifth root race that St. John is d escribing in the APOCALYPSE as the Armageddon of hu manity. For St. John, those people who have not evolved wit h the Christ principle within, past the animal natu re expressed in the seven heads, will be cast aside in the abyss. T hey will retain the ancient Atlantis etheric form o f the beast and will re-appear in the age of the pouring out of the vials of wrath, when the earth splits into two hal ves. The Christ men will appear, in the age of the seven seals (the sixth root race) in the white garments and the non -Christ men will appear as the beast with seven heads and ten horns. TABLE OF FORCES A final aspect of elementals that deserves consider ation are those that have been trapped by the Lucif eric and Ahrimanic influences. From the direction of the moon towards earth and li ving in the earth's atmosphere are elementals manif ested in the wind and weather. They are composed of the fire and air elements and have no connection with the water and earth elements. Th ese are the Luciferic spirits to which Steiner ofte n refers. From the direction of the center of the earth towar ds the planet surface are elementals manifested in the geological processes of plate tectonics including volcanoes, e arthquakes, and so-called hot spots. They are compo sed of the earth and water elements and have no connection wit h the fire and air elements. Steiner refers to them as Ahrimanic beings. Both of these classes of elementals work with more advanced and mature planetary beings. The Luciferic beings work with planetary forces instreaming from the moo n, Venus and Mercury and work against the instreami ng forces coming from Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. Likewise, the Ahrimanic forces work with the planetary forces in streaming from Saturn, Jupiter and Mars and work against the instreaming forces coming from moon, Mercury and Ve nus. It is the ordained task of the sun forces to keep these c onflicting forces in check, for not to do so, leads to the Eighth Sphere. The task of the elementals influenced by Altriman i s to draw men down and fasten him forever to the ea rth. During life, they draw the instinctive nature out of man a nd at death, they try to chain the soul to earth. T his effect can be seen in the shortened spiritual life, after death a nd before rebirth, while the soul travels through t he spiritual hierarchies. By reducing the time the soul spends i n a spiritual after life, the more this soul is dra wn to earth and less likely to incarnate. The overall process is a sort of re-building of the group soul of humanity which has been reduced thru the development of the ego principle. The evol ution of the ego through successive earth incarnati ons is necessarily a detachment from the group ego existin g on the astral plane. Those two processes are inve rsely proportional and a war is waged in man over these c ompeting forces. In those kingdoms that have a grou p soul, the mineral, plant and animal, there is no such conflic t. Ultimately, Ahriman and his legions of sub-human earth- water elementals would desire to have mankind grounded to earth evolution and prevent the future Jupiter, Ve nus and"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Vulcan Manuvantara's. The task of the elementals influenced by Lucifer is in opposition to everything Ahrimanic. The Lucifer ic forces are connected to the higher bodies of man and desire to make him a spiritual and moral being, however, wit hout freedom. This concept corresponds in me to a beehiv e or anthill in which there is a very highly sophis ticated social and moral order, but without freedom. These element als would like to see man evolve past his physical earth-water connection to the earth and live an angelic moral l ife in an astral condition, without a physical body . In conclusion, we have the Luciferic spirits compos ed of fire and air competing for the higher triad. We have the Ahrimanic spirits composed of earth and water compe ting for the lower quaternary. Finally, we have man composed of all four ancient elements. When we add the house s of the zodiac from the Chaldean calendar that rel ate to the triads of the elements, we get a picture of man like this: PLANET ELEMENT HOUSE CONSCIOUSNESS Atma Sun Saturn fire air Leo Aquarius Virgo Buddhi Mars Venus fire air Aries Libra Libra Manas Jupiter Mercury fire air Sagittarius Gemini Scorpio EGO Sagittarius Astral body Jupiter Mercury water earth Pisces Virgo Capricorn Etheric body Mars Venus water earth Scorpio Taurus Aquarius Physical body Moon Saturn water earth Cancer Capricorn Pisces Thus, as the ego transforms the astral body into Ma nas, we have the planets Jupiter and Mercury. As th e ego transforms the etheric body into Buddhi, we have th e planets Mars and Venus. As the ego transforms the physical body into Atma, we have the common planet Saturn an d the union of the sun and moon. The lower quaterna ry is grounded in the earth and water elements while the higher triad is approached by the fire and air elem ents. Each principle is an expression of a duality in both the planetary level and the zodiacal level. At the zod iac level, the houses represent degrees of consciousness, of which there are twelve in all, with man reaching from Pi sces up to Virgo, the highest level obtainable during this evo lution of seven manvantaras. AKAHSA CHRONICLE Prior to Eliphas Levi, no Western occultist was rea lly open about his \"source\" of knowledge of the spi ritual/occult history of mankind. Levi spoke of his source as the \"Astral Light\", which for him included the Akasha as well as all other phenomenon, including the \"electro-magnetic e ther, the ambient and all penetrating fluid, the vi tal light and the body of the holy ghost.\" As the good madame Bla vatsky said \"Eliphas Levi commits a great blunder i n always identifying the Astral Light with what we call the Akasha.\" For her, \"Akasha is not even the Ether, le ast of all then, we imagine, cannot be the astral Light, which is si mply the older sidereal Light of Paracelsus.\" These are the reasons occultists refuse to give the name of the Astral Li ght to the Akasha or to call it the Ether. For the good Madame, \"Akasha is space itself, in one sense, or both it's sixth and seventh principles\", the fifth principle being is what is commonly called the Ether. And, \" Akasha is the pri mary ether, emanating from Pradhana in seven forms of Prakrita, of which the Astral Light is the lowest\", deriving from the forces of nature. As a cosmic el ement or bhuta, it is thru the Akasha that the light-sound and life ethers manifest as the 5th-6th and 7th principles of creation. What is known in occultism as the Akasha Chronicle is the reflection of the Akasha in the three higher macrocosmic ethers of light, sound and life. For this reason, t he Akasha Chronicle exists in the macrocosm on thes e three different levels and likewise can be \"seen in vision\" in the light ether, \"heard\" as sound in the sound ether or \"swallowed\" in"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"the life ether as in the \"Book of Wisdom\" related i n the Apocalypse. Neither Levi nor the good Madame actually said that they read from the chronicle, but we cert ainly know that they did. It was Dr. Steiner in his two books, OCCULT SCIENCE and COSMIC MEMORY, who first said th at he in fact read from the chronicle. Here he says , \"The one who has the ability to perceive in the spi ritual world comes to know past events in their ete rnal character...They appear before one in full life...T hose initiated into the reading of such a living sc ript can look back into a much more remote past than is represented by external history.\" From this script, Steiner has g iven us the historical facts of the Old Saturn, Old Sun, Old Mo on and present Earth manvantaras, including the liv es of the Lemurian and Atlantean racial Ages. Dr. Steiner did say that \" I am obligated to remain silent about t he sources of the information given here.\" Presumably, he had bee n restricted from revealing much of the \"knowledge hidden within the Theosophical movement.\" Long after the deaths of Levi, Blavatsky and Steine r, the Anon-ymous author of MEDITATIONS ON THE TARO T gives us a further explanation of the Akasha Chroni cle and it's relation to the Fifth Gospel of Christ . For Anon, \"the Akasha chronicle is the macrocosmic analogy to the total memory of the microcosmic unconsciousness.\" For him, the unconsciousness corr esponds to the collective psychic memory of all hum ankind as with Jung in his \"collective unconsciousness.\" The three tableaus of psychic memory correspond to the three types of conscious memory which he terms the \"Automatic m emory, the Logical memory and the Moral memory.\" Automatic memory is that faculty manifested in chil dhood which reproduces in the imagination all the f acts of the past as raw material for use by the conscious self. As such, automatic memory is \"weakened in proporti on to the extent with which age increases.\" Logical memory is that faculty manifested during mi ddle life , wherein the rational mind \"weaves a tab leau of the past according to the lines of sequential reasoning that intelligence finds relevant.\" The tableau of factual associations developed during childhood is replaced over age with a more meaningful memory of the rela tionships between things, events and ideas. Moral memory is that faculty arising during old age wherein the memory tableau reveals moral and spiri tual values. The recall memory of a person in old age depends on the intensity in which these values are interwoven with the past tableau of automatic and logical memories. Wha t we observe as senility in old persons depends lar gely on the fact that those persons did not develop a moral mem ory tableau during their lifetime. Emotional intens ity is the key here more so than the intrinsic moral value of an e vent. However, moral events always carry with it th e requisite emotional intensity, such that all moral events are more likely to be remembered. For example, a senil e person may not remember what he had for breakfast today, but h e is likely to remember what he had for breakfast o n the day of his first communion. this moral memory is a sort of common ground in which the other two memories take root. Now this three fold human memory take it's correspo ndence in the macrocosm in the three-fold Akasha Ch ronicle, which in turn takes it's correspondence in the thre e-fold higher ethers of light-sound-life. Herr Dr. Steiner only spoke about a single cosmic memory which he describ es as a sort of movie picture reel of pictures unfo lding before the higher Imaginative consciousness. However, Mada me Blavatsky recognized a two-fold cosmic memory as early as ISIS UNVEILED when she said, \"The astral light i s dual and bisexual, the male part of it is purely divine and spiritual; it is wisdom; while the female portion i s tainted , in one sense, with matter and therefore is evil already.\" In the SECRET DOCTRINE the Madame says, \"the seven pri nciples of the Eastern initiates had not been expla ined when Isis Unveiled was written\" and she goes on to say \"they are one and the same thing seen from two different aspects, the spiritual and the psychic.\" She recogn izes that the Akasha as a whole manifests in a sept enary extending from the purely spiritual to the purely physical an d as such, this creates two streams from the single source described by Steiner. Says Anon, \"Thus, a two-fold process ta kes place in the Ahasha chronicle: it is spirituali zed and at the same concretized, in proportion to the extent that the distance from the present into the past increas es.\" The trail of the chronicle extending backwards over long periods of time, on the one hand, ascends tow ards higher spheres and on the other hand, descends towards low er spheres, which for the good Madame was the duali ty of male/female, wisdom/tainted and spiritual/physical. _______ Higher chronicle (2nd) _____________________ _______________ (Back in historical time) ________________ present time _______________ ____________________ _______ Lower chronicle (1st) The lower Chronicle consists of the history of fact s in a Quantitative tableau which corresponds in th e microcosm to our automatic associative memory in humans. As such , it is subject to the errors and mistakes of inter pretation and"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"extrapolation that also exist in automatic memory. In this regard Dr. Steiner said, \"Spiritual percept ion is not infallible...This perception can err, can see in an inexact, oblique, wrong manner. No man is free fro m error in this field, no matter how high he stands.\" This \"error o f transcription\"occurs because the further one goes back in history, the further the lower Chronicle has slippe d from sphere to sphere, ending in what Blavatsky c alled the (sub- terranean) sphere of matter/evil. It is from this l ower record that we see the clairvoyant investigati ons in the 20th century of C.W. Leadbeater and Edgar Cayce's vision s of ancient Atlantean culture. For this reason, both Anon and Steiner have stresse d that there is no further need for new revelations from the Chronicle. (but what of the revelation of the two J esus children?) What is necessary is to develop a \" living tradition\", where each occultist continues the work of his predecessor, by confirming the truth, filli ng in the gaps and correcting the errors of vision or interpretati on. Steiner writes of a tradition, \"that various initiates can relate about history an d pre-history will be in essential agreement. Such a history and pre- history does exist in all mystery schools. Here for millennia, the agreement has been so complete that the conformity existing among external historians of even a single century cannot be compared with it. The initiates describe essentially the same things at all times and in all places.\" . The Second Akasha Chronicle is that higher, spiritu al record which preserves a Qualitative tableau, wh ich over time has separated out the distortions extant from the l ower record. Just as our logical memory replaces th e associative facts of our automatic memory, so too the higher Ch ronicle \"is the intelligent memory of the history o f the world.\" The abstractions used in our logical memory transfo rm the associative facts of the lower Chronicle int o symbolic facts in the higher Second Chronicle. These symboli c facts, thru this process of discrimination, must be extrapolated into universal intelligent forms , from which all o ccultists in their vision must draw conclusions to be placed in this \"Book of Truth.\" The esoteric history of the world is drawn from these spiritual conclusions by such a uthors as Hildegard of Bingen, Fabre d'Olivet, Saint-Yves d'A lveydre, Rudolph Steiner and Valentin Tomberg. By t heir efforts, the historical facts from the lower record are extrapolated into symbolic facts and preserved in the book of Truth by the \"living tradition\" of clairvoyant occu ltists. However more than just clairvoyant consciousness in the Imaginative tableau is required for a proper o rganization of historical facts into logical, symbolic conclusions . The act requires the rational faculties of the lo gical memory together with the moral qualities of an initiate th at has purified his astral body from all passion, g reed and selfishness. Nothing goes into the Book of Truth fr om such immoral perverts as C.W.Leadbeater, Pascal Beverly Randolf or Alister Crowley nor from the drug induce d visions of Anna Kingsford or Dr. Timothy Leary. In addition, the function of clairvoyant consciousn ess here in this Chronicle is not the same as a cla irvoyant perception into the etheric and astral spheres of n ature, which have revelations of an entirely differ ent nature. I am reminded here of the comments of P.D. Ouspensky on his path thru the lower and higher thresholds of pe rception. \"I had come across in my reading...which I could re call neither deliberate falsification nor real clairvoyance. Thus, the clairvoyance of Leadbe ater and Dr. Steiner, all the Akashic records, the descriptions of what happened tens of thousands of years ago in myt hical Atlantis or in other pre-historic countries. The only difference was that I did not believe my experience s, while the Akashic records were believed and are believed by both their authors and readers.... It very soon bec ame evident to me that it was all reflected, it all came from memory, from the imagination. This explains why it is that authors who describe Atlantis are unable wi th the aid of their clairvoyance to solve any practical problems relating to the present which are always so easy fi nd.\" This raises a very interesting problem that has alw ays personally bothered me. For as Ouspensky furthe r asks, \"Why do they know everything that happened thirty thousa nd years ago and do not know what is happening at t he time of their experiments, BUT IN ANOTHER PLACE.?\" My feeli ng was, if these persons are so perceptive, tell me what is happening across the street? This is a poignant question, but misdirected, as there are two opposit e processes of clairvoyance going on here. One is clairvoyance on the level of Imaginative consciousness that puts on e in touch with our lower and higher Chronicles, which is by d efinition (as Ouspensky correctly pointed out), ref lective from memory and not introspective. Introspective clairvo yance, on the other hand, also takes one into highe r levels of consciousness, but thru the opposite path of percep tion of elementary nature spirits. In addition to the lower and higher Chronicles, the re is a Third Chronicle which contains what is of e ternal value to mankind and the future earth evolution. It is calle d the \"Book of Life\" in occultism or the \"Book of t he Prophets\" by Sister (Christian) Anne Catherine Emmerich. In what is perhaps Sister Christian's most extraordinary v ision, she and her guardian angel travel in vision to the sacred \" Mountain of the Prophets\" in Tibet. Here she saw a long tent in which a table stood in the center. There was a figu re that looked like Elias or (no surprise) John the Baptist and he was writing with a reed on a long scroll of parchme nt. \"In the middle of the table lay an immense book tha t could be opened and shut and it was to this book the man referred to see if the others were right...Right an d left lay great books and parchments rolls on rods with knobs on"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"either end...He told me he was there to guard every thing until the time would come to make use of it.. .Around the tent were other books and rolls, very old and preci ous. The figure told me that these books contained all the holiest things that had ever come from man. He examined and compared all and threw what was false into the fir e near the tent.\" Later, after several other visits to the hol y mountain, Sister Christian says that \"I know why I went to the Mountain. My book lies among the writings on the ta ble, all that is to be secured from destruction is there preserved.\" Later, after several other visits to the Holy Mount ain, Sister Christian says that \"I know why I went to the Mountain. My Book lies among the writings on the table, all t hat is to be secured from destruction is there pres erved.\" This story relates four spiritual facts of concern. First, there is a \"Book of the Prophets\" which is the Third Akasha Chronicle and corresponds to the moral memory in ma n. It contains those pictures from the higher chron icle that deserve eternal value in the same sense that man's moral memory is eternal and passes on with him into devachan. From this book preserving the eternal moral memory of the world come the \"imaginations\" which will pas s over from this Earth manvantara to the future \"Jupiter\" manvantara. Here we can see this lives of the most glorious saints, martyrs and initiates and the writings of the Churc h Fathers long since lost or destroyed. Second, on this table are many other manuscripts wr itten by many other persons, which are first compar ed to the great book of the Prophets and if satisfactory, the y are added to the great book. this would include t he meditative writings and prayers of the great anonymous authors throughout history; the symbolic account of the gr eat moral decisions that occurred throughout history, such as the prayers of St. Hedwig to turn back the Huns or the decision of Thomas Moore of Cantebury to defy King Henry the VIII; and the kind and gentle acts of charity perf ormed by those of less than saintly stature, but nevertheles s, remembered as part of the moral fabric of humani ty Third, there is an editor, in the cloak of Elijah/J ohn the Baptist, who compares and edits the symbols from the Book of Truth and transcribes them into the Book of the Prophets. Why John the Baptist in this role? Becaus e as Dr. Steiner said \"The St.John Ego descended from the sa me holy region as that from which the soul-being of the Jesus child from the Gospel of St. Luke descended.\" This holy soul was also preserved with the Nathan Jesus soul in that Mother-Lodge of Humanity since the time of Adam and before the Fall of Mankind. Who better an editor t han this arch-angelic sister-soul of Adam who has lived sinc e the beginning of human time? Lastly, the Book of the Prophets is preserved and g uarded until \"the time will come to make use of it\" and this time is the Judgment Day of the Apocalypse. It is in eve ry sense a book of Resurrection which will be viewe d before the soul in final judgment in the same way that the sou l in Kama-loka also views the book of his past life in judgment. And, as the view of moral judgment during Kama-loka passes over into devachan, so too does the moral c ontents of this book of Resurrection pass over for mankind as world karma into the future Jupiter Manvantara. Finally, a comment must be made on the nature of \"p rophecy\" in itself and where it is found. Prophecy is being raised in Imaginative vision from the physical plan e to the three higher planes of consciousness belon ging to the Conditions of Form or in Theosophy, called the Glob es. They are in their septenary nature as follows: higher devachan higher devachan lower devachan lower devachan astral higher astral physical Here on the physical plane, our waking day consciou sness of cognitive thought comes from the deeds of our Guardian Angels, while during sleep, we travel in o ur astral body and ego to the astral plane and live among the thoughts of the higher Angelic hierarchies. Our mos t profound Christian source of prophecy is the APOC ALYPSE OF ST. JOHN. The seer of Patmos wrote this Book of Revelations about the \"thunder and lightning\" of th e revelations of the Seraphim and Cherubim. As such, his source of revelation was from realms within dev achan that are infinitely higher than where our normal day or night consciousness extends. When St. John saw into these higher planes, he desc ribed the symbols of the Book of Prophets which app eared to him in Imaginative picture forms. For the future si xth cultural epoch (the Age of Aquarius), he saw th e symbol of the Church of Philadelphia and for the future seven th cultural epoch (the Age of Capricorn), he saw th e symbol of the Church of Loadicea. Likewise for the future Six th Root Race following our present Aryan Root Race, he saw the seven seals, which represent the future seven cultu ral epochs of that Age. For the future Seventh Root Race, he saw the seven trumpets, whose angels represent the futu re seven cultural epochs of this last great Age. Af terwards, he"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"saw the end of historical time as we will know it, falling into death and destruction symbolized by th e seven vials of wrath. On Judgment Day was read the Book of Prophet s and from the life of Christ was read the Book of God. Finally, he saw the \"descent of the Heavenly Jerusa lem\", after which comes the long pralaya before the coming of the next \"Jupiter\" planetary evolution. The descent of the Heavenly Jerusalem is also a sym bol which represents the descent of the plane of Hi gher Devachan (shown above) to the physical plane. What the seer St. John saw in vision in his day two thou sand years ago was our moral symbols from the Third Chronicle which had been preserved up to that time. Sister Ch ristian previously told us that the Book of Prophets was al ways being written, it is never finished. But certa in moral symbols that are recognized as eternal form the vis ion of the Heavenly Jerusalem on the plane of Devac han, which in the future, will pass over unto the physical pla ne. Prophecy is the present vision of those eternal symbols located on the higher astral and devachan planes written in the Book of Prophets, the events of which by their intrinsic nature pass from the future into the present over t he course of historical time. finally, the correspondences found in the various s pheres of macrocosm and microcosm are related as fo llows: Human Chronicle Book Bhutas Moral Memory 3 rd moral Prophets/Life Life swallow Logical memory 2 nd higher Truth sound HEAR Factual memory 1 st lower Archives light see fire air water earth THE FIFTH GOSPEL There is in addition to the above three Chronicles, both a Fourth Chronicle and a fourth book. Here th ey do not have the same correspondences because they are based, no t upon the human memory and principles, but upon th e historical \"Life of Christ.\" This book of the \"Life of Christ\" was first introduced to us by Dr. Stein er who called it the FIFTH GOSPEL. However, Steiner left the impress ion that this 5th Gospel was generally drawn from t he Akashic record, without further distinction. In fac t, the 5th Gospel forms a higher fourth chronicle a nd knowledge of it is very important to the understanding of the sp iritual foundations of Christianity. As is well known, the reason for the universally ac cepted religious practice of \"waking the dead\" come s from the occult fact of the dispersal of the etheric body im mediately after death. In India, we still see the t radition of placing rice balls around the casket of the deceased in a r oom that has caged birds. The body is not cremated or buried until the birds, recognizing that the etheric body has fl ed the corpse, go to the casket and eat of the food placed there. A similar practice in the ancient Mediterranean cultu res has a documented historical basis, but practice d with dogs instead of birds. After death, the etheric body expands and slowly di sperses into the etheric sphere over a period of ab out three days. During this time, like the familiar tales of the dr owning man, the entire life-tableau of the deceased person passes before the soul's eye, in a series of pictures in r everse order. A holographic kernel of this life tab leau, as eternal moral memory, remains over to accompany the soul in to kama-loka or purgatory. In STUDIES OF THE NEW TESTAMENT Valentin Tomberg explains the source of the distin ct life of Christ with an explanation never touched upon by Steiner. He says that Jesus at His death renounced the vision of His life tableau. \"He gave it up to humanity\" and it later became the content of what the apostles saw in vision during the Pentecost event. This description gives many very important i nsights. First, it explains the \"source\" of the \"Life of Chr ist\" that the apostles, Matthew, Mark, Luke and Joh n, used to write down their gospel stories. A very strong argument h as always been made by critics of the New Testament that how could the apostles write in the gospels about the p assion and crucifixion of Christ if they (except Jo hn) were admittedly, not present to watch these events? This is a very poignant criticism. However, at the Pentecost event, when the Holy Spir it descended, the flame, first raised the conscious ness of the"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"apostles from a human/angelic level to that of an a rch-angelic level. Second, by the light of the flam e of the Holy Spirit, the apostles saw in Imaginative vision, the entire life of Christ as reflected in His etheric life tableau, that did not disperse back into the etheric sphere at His cr ucifixion, but was preserved and \"given back to hum anity.\" For the ordinary man, our etheric body after death, disperses back into the general etheric sphere and our life tableau becomes part of the lower, historical Chronicle. Bu t for the Christ, His etheric life tableau did not disperse back into the etheric sphere and become part of the lower Chr onicle . His life tableau was preserved intact and given back to humanity as a separate higher Chronicle, known as t he 5th Gospel. The effect of this occult fact serve s three important purposes. First, the 5th Gospel, when shown to the apostles a t Pentecost, allowed them to write their separate a ccounts of the life of Christ without actually being present for s uch events as the passion and the crucifixion. This explains neatly why there are four different approaches to the life of Christ as reflected in the four gospels. Each a postle, writing with an arch-angelic intelligence, observed and tra nscribed what was symbolically important to each fr om their own individual perceptions. This is the real reason why the gospel accounts are all slightly different in account and in events and not all the same as if from one single o bserver. Second, the 5th Gospel serves in vision as a source of inspiration to all great saints of Christianity . No person ever become a great saint without first, experiencing ve ry personally a portion of the life of Christ durin g prayer and meditation, and second, without seeing in Imaginati ve vision, scenes from the life of Christ as preser ved in the 5th Gospel. For example, the stigmata occurs in great saints on ly because they have, first, personally experienced the pain of the passion of Christ thru prayer, meditation and spiri tual exercises and, second, personally seen in Imag inative vision the scenes of the passion from the 5th Gospel. How do we know this to be true? In her biography, Siste r Christian's author relates that, \"One day about noon, she was kneeling in contemplat ion...she beheld in vision the tabernacle door open and (Christ) issue from it in the form of a radiant youth. In Hi s left hand, he held a garland, in His right hand, a Crown of Thorns, which He graciously presented to her in choice. She choose the Crown of Thorns. Then Jesus laid it lig htly upon her brow and she pressed it firmly down. From that inst ant, she experienced inexpressible pains in her hea d.\" Several days later, the blood from her stigmata beg an to flow and never stopped again during her lifet ime. Not all saints receive the gift of the stigmata fro m Christ a did Sister Christian. This is because no t all saints decide to experience the passion and crucifixion. For diff erent saints, different parts of the life of Christ are more important for personal and karmic reasons. But all great sain ts view some portion of the 5th Gospel. Those who w rite down their experiences are well known to Christianity, s uch as, St Theresa of Avila, St.John of the Cross, St. Bridget of Sweden, and the Ven. Mary of Agreda, Hildegard of B ingen and the Ven. Sister Emmerich. And there are o thers who do not write down their vision but simply say, as did St. Joan of Arc, that they have \"read from t he Book of God.\" The last purpose served by the 5th Gospel is reserv ed for the future. As we discussed above, when the Judgment Day of the Apocalypse arrives, the Book of the Prop hets will be opened and viewed before the souls in their Final Judgment. but, whereas the moral truths of the thir d Chronicle change during the life of each manvanta ra, the truths of the Book of God never change. What passes over a s eternal truths of the human moral history from ea ch of the future Earth, Jupiter, and Venus manvantaras, will change as does human history itself. However, the o ne time events of the life of Christ will never change and will always serve as the ideal life from which all our human lives will be compared. THE IDENTITY OF THE TEACHER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS Qumran The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran is the archaeological event of the millennium and unfo rtunately, their suppression from translation and publication is the spiritual crime of the millennium. Of what f ew scrolls that have been published, two sources of controversy hav e emerged. The first concerns the identity of the authors of t he Dead Sea Scrolls. The historical context of this time evolved from the division of the kingdom of Alexander the G reat after his death in 323 B.C. into the two rulin g dynasties of"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"the Ptolemies and the Seleucids. Palestine was rule d by one of these families until the second century B.C. revolt of the Maccabees, who liberated Jerusalem from Antioch us IV Epiphanies (175-164). This revolt was histori cally necessary to re-establish the high priest Zadokite line appointed by King David to fulfill the prophec y that the Messiah would be born of the House of David (the So lomon Jesus child). During the Seleucid reign, the high priest office w as appointed after being purchased by the highest b idder. The orderly succession of the Zadokite priest line fail ed when in 172 B.C. Onias III (a legitimate High Pr iest) was murdered in Jerusalem. Even if he was not asassinat ed, he was exiled to Egypt where either him or his son, Onias IV, built the Temple of Leontopolis. King Antiochus appointed Meneleus, a Hellenized Jew outside the Z adok line and in 165 B.C. Judas Maccabeus led a revolt to res tore the faith. The Hasmonean dynasty of kings emer ged and lasted until the Herodian dynasty beginning 37 B.C. During this time, numerous Jewish sects arose and competed for power and influence. These included the Zealots ,, the Sicarii, the Boethusians and the Hasidim. As described by the Historian Josephus, the three most dominant sec ts were the Pharisees, the Sadducees and the Essene s. Only the Pharisees survived the Roman destruction o f Jerusalem in 70 A.D. The Mishnah (200 A.D.) is pr esumably their literary legacy of Rabbinic Judaic Law. No te xt of any kind has ever been attributed to the writ ten Hand of the Sadducees, so presumably they did not write the 800 manuscripts found in the eleven Qumran caves. By p rocess of elimination, in this sense, the authorship of the S crolls fall on the Essenes. In another historical sense, the Natural History wr itten by Pliny the Elder (23-79A.D.) cannot be igno red by even the most skeptical mind. He says, \"On the west side of the Dead Sea, but out of range of the exhalations o f the coast, is the solitary tribe of the Essenes, which is remarka ble beyond all other tribes in the whole world, as it has no women and has renounced all sexual desire, has no money, and has only palm trees for company\". Frankly no better description of the monastic life of the Essene settlement can be given. After the di scovery of the Scrolls in the nearby caves, an expedition was orga nized by Dominican priest Roland de Vaux to excavat e the site of Khirbet Qumran. Although, scholars again disagree, arguing that the site could be a wealthy villa or m ilitary fortress, the excavations reveal an ancient monaste ry with a large scriptorium in which dozens of inkw ells were found. As Qumran research has matured, the debate o ver the Essene/Sadducee origin of the Scrolls was p ut to rest by Harvard scholar and senior Scroll editor Frank C ross in 1966 when he unequivocally identified \"the men of Qumran with their perennial house guests, the Essen es.\" Now that most scholars agree Qumran was an Essene m onastery, the second issue is the identity of the o ften referred Teacher of Righteousness (T of R). Moreh Tzedek Scholars have proposed two possible origins for the Essene community, one in Palestine and the other i n Babylonia. The Palestinian theory recognizes that after the re storation of the Zadokite line to the Jerusalem tem ple by the Maccabees revolt, the Hasmonean line of kings were even more Hellenized than their predecessors. They signed agreements with the Roman Senate and employed Helle nized Jews as ambassadors. Instead of a return to o rthodox Judaism, the Hasmonean kings increased Hellenizatio n. As a reaction to this usurpation, this theory suppo ses orthodox Jews rallied around a man referred to frequently in the Scrolls as Moreh Tzedek, the Teacher of Righteo usness, made him their leader and reestablished the ir monastery at Qumran. Here in the desert they could observe th e Mosiac Law and live a life of ritual purity until the day when the T of R could return to Jerusalem as the High Pr iest descended from Zadok. Indeed, the recovered Es sene Manual of Discipline is a rigorous set of rules regulating the monastic life at Qumran. The Palestine origin theory is, of course, incorrect, particularly when considering ho w such a huge library at Qumran could have accumula ted over only several generations. The Babylonian theory of Essene origins traces this group back to the captivity after the destruction of the Temple in 596-586 B.C. The so-called Damascus Document of the recovered Scrolls suggests that the Essenes had be en together long before the T of R appeared. Much of t he legislation contained in the Damascus Document g overns community living in a non-Jewish state, including r egulations for dealing with Gentiles. It contains a n historical summary that ends with the Babylonian Captivity. In addition, a \"new covenant in the land of Damascus\" is established by the survivors of the exile. Damascus is, of course, a symbolic name for the land of Bab ylon in Chaldea. That the Damascus Document was written by Jews living in the Babylonian exile and later carri ed with the Essences to Qumran after the liberation by King Cyr us is very reasonable to conclude. The Michael Age Particularly when you consider what a remarkable co incidence of spiritual streams converged during the Babylonian captivity, such as may not have occurred again unti l the end of Kali Yuga. During this forty-two reign of King Nebuchadnezzan (604-562 B.C.) at Babylon, we have f irst and foremost the centuries old mystery center of the Persian second cultural epoch. Leading to the great sanctuary of Marduk called E. Sag Ila, was the cer emonial Street of Babel. This processional path was seventy-five f eet wide, with a retaining wall twenty-five feet hi gh and lined"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"with an endless sequence of lion figures. Timely in carnated into this center of the Ishtar cult was th e person known historically as Zarathustra. In his next incarnatio n (the cycle of Neros?) he was to become the Solomo n Jesus Child of Nazareth and it was secret knowledge of this inc arnation 600 years later that led the three Magi fr om Babylon to Bethlehem following the Star of Zarathustra. His ta sk was as teacher to prepare for the Christ event o f the Fourth Cultural Epoch of Pisces beginning 747 B.C. Against this background of the Chaldean mystery cen ter, we have at the same historical time, the birth of the Buddha mystery stream which was also to merge into the Christ event 600 years later when the Nirmanaka ya of Buddha was given to the Nathan Christ child. When t he Gautama Buddha achieved Nirvana, he passed his o ffice as teacher to his successor, the Bodhisattva, who late r was sent as the T of R to the Essene community at Qumran. Finally, the last element of the three-fold mystery stream merger was provided by the presence of the Jews in captivity. At this historical time, within two gene rations a whole series of former initiates of the M elchizedek mystery stream incarnated and streamen upon Babylon . First, Jeremiah, then Ezekiel, then Daniel and fi nally, Ezra, the scribe of Old Testament. Those prophets were de scendants of the High Priesthood line of Zadek and bearers of the mystery wisdom imparted to Abraham from Melchiz edek, the great sun-initiate. This three-fold merger of mystery streams through t heir human representatives of Nazarathos, the Bodhi sattva, and Ezekiel was, of course, only made possible by the a rchangel Michael. Prior to this time, Michael had b een the guiding folk-spirit of the Jews until he ascended, in his turn, to the status of Spirit of the Age. Mi chael as representative of the Sun, whose angelic body would host the Christ ego as He descended through the he avenly spheres to incarnation during the baptism at the Jo rdan River, led a Golden Age which produced the gen ius of Plato and Pythagorus, the leadership of King Cyrus and en ded with the scholarship of Aristotle and the reign of his pupil, Alexander the Great. All told, the T of R weaves through the Dead Sea Sc rolls in the same way that Dionysius the Areopagite weaves his way through the writings of St. Thomas Aquinus. Let ters to him remind one of letters to the Friend of God from the Highlands. He led the battle in the Sons of Light a gainst the Sons of Darkness. He was the teacher in the tradition of the heavenly high priest, Melchizedek, the sun Manu to whom the Scrolls (11QMELCHIZADEK) regard as an angelic being who lives forever as King of Righteou sness. He announced that great events would soon co me upon the last generation for those who believed in his c ovenant. He separated himself from the Jerusalem pr iesthood and like a prophet, his teaching was full of the Holy S pirit. The New Temple Foremost for the Essene community was the critique against the Second Temple built by Zerubbabel in 51 5 B.C. and the later reign of the Hasmonean dynasty. With Simon Maccabaeus, the previously separate sacerdota l (priestly) lines and the royal (kingly) lines were united into one dynasty of priest-king. This separation of off ices was very important to the eschatology of the Essenes. For th em, the material ideal was represented in the old s econd Temple in the Holy of Holies and the sanctuary. In the \"ne w Temple\", these are replaced by the \"sacerdotal ci rcle\" and the circle formed by the rest of the faithful community . The fulfillment of these two circles was typified by the sons of Aaron and Israel. This concept is expressed by a pa ssage from the Manual of Discipline which clearly s hows the Essene Community anticipating the coming of TWO Mes siahs, \"There shall come the Prophet and the (two) Messiahs of Aaron and Israel.\" The prophet is of course the T of R who comes in th e strict sense of Ismaili Shiite prophetology with a revealed book, the Gospel of St. Matthew, and in the traditi on of a priest of Melchizedek. St. John the Baptist came as the prophet of Aaron and Christ as the prophet of Israe l. The unity of these two sacerdotal and royal line s was achieved in the birth of the two Jesus children and their un ity into one person at age twelve, when the Zarathu stra ego passed over into the body of the Nathan Jesus child. The Essenes had truly felt that God had abandoned t he children of Israel because of the usurpation of this sacerdotal lineage of Zadok by the Hasmonean dynasty and had a lso abandoned His presence in the second Temple by the occupation of the \"wicked priest\". The destruction of the first Temple of Solomon was caused by the si n of the Jews worshipping the pagan gods of Baal. The vision of E zekiel described the Glory of the Lord (the Shekhin ah) leaving Jerusalem. The prophecy of Ezekiel was the Divine r estoration of a \"new Temple\" re-establishing the sp iritual bond between Jehovah and his chosen people. The fulfillm ent of this prophecy rested in the Community of Qum ran and the success of their Teacher in revealing these Div ine truths as later preserved in the Gospel of St. Matthew. The historical purpose of the Essene community was to h ave at least a small group of people fully understa nd the immense significance of the coming of the Christ, b oth in an historical sense thru the teaching of the 3 X 14 generations of the St. Matthew Gospel and in a spir itual sense of the building of the new Temple. As observed by professor Henry Corbin, the T of R w as both a \"final prophet\" in the sense of a twelfth Iman revealing the esoteric meanings of all previous Div ine revelations and a \"new Ezekiel.\""},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"\"Like Ezekiel, he combined three offices in his per son: he was a priest of the line of Zadok, an inspi red prophet, and a visionary of divine things...To the extent to whi ch these three functions were also ascribed symboli cally to the members of the (Qumran) Community, it can fairly be considered an Ezekelian community...of the new tem ple.\" The Rabbinic Jesus Stories Nineteenth century esoteric sources for the identit y of the T of R include LaScience des Esprits by El iphas Levi; Royal Masonic Cylopaedia by Mackenzie and Isis Unve iled Vol. II by Madame H.P. Blavatsky, all of which reference the Talmud and Toldoth Jesus stories whic h, first thought of as a blind but later became the source of the \"fundemental error of the theosophists\". The Madame H.P.B. relates in her Lucifer article, The Esoteri c Character of the Gospels, \"Reference is made here to the Rabbinical tradition in the Babylonian Gemara, called Sepher Toldos Jeshu , about Jesus being the son of one named Pandira, and havin g lived a century earlier than the era called Chris tian, namely, during the reign of the Jewish king Alexander Janna eus and his wife Salome, who reigned from the year 106 to 79 B.C. Accused by the Jews of having learned the magi c art in Egypt, and of having stolen from the Holy of Holies the Incommunicable Name, Jehoshua (Jesus) was put to de ath by the Sanhedrin at Lud. He was stoned and then crucified on a tree, on the eve of Passover.\" G.R.S. Mead (1883-1933) was the General Secretary o f the Theosophical Society, private secretary to Ma dame H.P.Blavatsky, editor of several magazines and auth or of many books. He was a respected scholar of Gno sticism. In 1903 he published the study, Did Jesus Live 100 B.C .?He discusses the history and reprints some of the entire texts of the Talmud Balaam Jesus stories and the later me diaeval Toldoth Jesus stories. The Talmud Jesus stories were the stock-in-trade Ra bbinic Jewish objections to the Christian dogmatic tradition. In them, Jesus is referred to as Jeschu ben Pandera (o r Pandira) or simply Ben Pandera and in the Lud sto ries as Ben Stada. He was born \"a bastard son of a women in her separation\" of Miriam, the woman's hairdresser. He was said to have \"practiced sorcery and seduced Israel and estr anged them from God\". During the Passover festival, he was stoned to death by the Sanhedrin and later hung on the Sabbath day. By tradition, Jeschu had five disciples namely, Mat hai, Nakkai, Netzer, Bunni and Jodah. That they wer e Therapeutae Healers in the Essene tradition is clea r from the following story. The son of Rabbi Jehoshua Ben Levi had the somethin g stuck in his throat. He went to fetch one of the men of the Ben Pandera, to bring out what he had swallowed. A man came and whispered to him (a spell) in the name of Ben Pandera and he got well. What did you say over him? He answered: A certain verse after a certain man. He (Levi) said: It had been better for him had he buried him and not said over him that verse. Obviously, this story shows the vehemence against t he healing disciples when the Rabbi would prefer to have his son dead and buried rather than healed under the sp ell of Ben Pandera. In the end, all five disciples were put to death. T heir names have always been a source of speculation among commentators. Netzer certainly refers to the Nazars sect discussed by Madame H.P.B. in Isis Unveiled l ocated in the village of Nazareth. Bunni may refer to Bannus, the Essene teacher of Josephus. Mathai refers to the author of the Gospel of St. Ma tthew of the New Testament which occult history sho ws to have been written in Aramaic Hebrew before the birth of Christ. The other names are untraceable and as Mead suggests are meant for names for leaders of schools or sects existing at the beginning of the Christain era. The medieval Toldoth texts have been classified int o five general types, the only remaining printed te xts are of Wagensiel (1681) and Huldreich (1705). \"Toldoth Jes chu\" literally means the Generations of Jeschu, a s ort of Jewish life of Jesus or Jeschu. All these various t ypes of recensions bear the scars of a bitter medie val polemical literature debate against the excesses of the Chris tians in persecuting the Jews. For these reasons, t here is a great variety of titles, characters, storylines and dates extending from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuri es. These narratives are more lengthy in dealing with the mag ician charges against Jeschu but shorter when deali ng wth the actual physical death. The following is a typical s ummary description. First and foremost, Jeschu was a magician. In the s anctuary in Jerusalem \" lay a foundation stone, God founded it and on it were written the letters of the Shem and whoever learned it, could do whatsoever he would\". To protect this sanctuary, brazen dogs were bound at two iron pillars at the entrance and whomever entered and le arned the identity of the letters, upon exiting, when the dog s bayed at him, the memory of the letters would van ish. Jeschu entered the Holy of Holies, wrote down the l etters on parchment, cut into his skin and laid the name in the wound under the cut flap of skin. Upon leaving the sanctuary, the brazen dogs bayed at him and his mem ory lapsed according to the tradition. However, when he went h ome, he opened the flap of skin and retrieved the H oly Name. The Shem is the seventy-two syllabled name of God m ade up of 216 letters extrapolated from Exodus. Fro m it is derived the 72 angels of Jacob's Ladder. Commonly k nown as Shem-Ha-Meforash, the correct pronunciation of this ineffable name of God was lost and not recovered un til about 300 A.D. by the Kabbalists who gave it th e title tetragrammaton. (JHVH)."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The power of Shem is miraculous as Moses is said to have used it to part the waters of the Red Sea. Je schu used its power to heal the sick, lame and lepers. The people of Galilee made clay birds, after speaking the let ters of the Shem, they flew away as real birds. He once rolled a millstone to the edge of the sea and spoke the le tters. He then placed the stone in the water and sat upon it as if floating in a boat. Of course, these miracles of Jeschu didn't please t he elders and priests any more than did the miracle s of Christ please the Sadducees or Pharisees. What distinguish es the Talmud stories from the Toldoth stories is t he unique parallel with the death of Christ. Andre Dupont-Som mer (1952) was absolutely right in his assertion th at the life of the TR prefigured that of Jesus. Obviously, I do no t know what the Dead Sea Scrolls say about the deat h of the TR, but the Toldoth stories narrate the final days as f ollows. The elders befriended a man named Juda Ischariota a nd took him to the temple to learn and steal the le tters of the Shem as Jeschu had once done. Juda then challenged Jeschu to a duel to the death in which they flew in to the air like eagles and fought a bitter battle. However, since t he power of the Shem was equal, neither could preva il. When they fell to the ground exhausted, Jeschu was captured. The elders took Jeschu to the Queen (Helen) and ask ed that he be put to death. After interrogation, sh e released him back to the elders. They took Jeschu to the synagog ue of Tiberias, where he was bound, tortured, given vinegar to drink as water and a crown of thorns set upon his h ead. To his rescue came his 310 apostates and broug ht him to the City of Antioch to rest. On the Friday of Passover, Jeschu come into Jerusal em riding an ass with his apostates in glory. Anoth er betrayer named Gaisa (the gardener) approached the elders an d offered to identify and disclose the sanctuary wh ere Jeschu was in repair. The elders went to the sanctuary (a school house) with Gaisa where Jeschu was discovere d with four of his disciples, Mathai, Naki, Boni and Netzer. Al l were quickly put to death, the exact method of de ath being unclear. Later, the wise elders of the Jerusalem temple trie d to hang the body of Jeschu on a tree for public d isplay. In every attempt the tree broke and it is unclear whether Je schu was still alive uttering the Shem or if no tre e would bear him for some mystical purpose. Finally, the body was la id over a large cabbage stalk (?) until the time of afternoon prayer, when the body was buried in traditional man ner. The apostates wept over the grave site for several days until it was discovered that the body was not inside the burial mound. Alarmed, the elders rushed to the Queen abou t the revelation. The Queen, worried that Jeschu fu lfilled his own prophecy about ascending to heaven, ordered a g reat search for the missing body and promised her w rath if it could not be found. All Jerusalem was in mortal fea r. Apparently, another gardener found the slain bod y and buried it in his yard, not telling anyone about the less t han proper burial. Upon finding the body of Jeschu, the elders dragged the corpse around the streets of Jerusalem in public display and mock of the apostates. It is an occult law that cycles repeat a subsequent time at a higher level, progress is a spiral not a straight line. This is the reason for the life of Jeschu Ben Pandera as a pre-figuration for the life of Christ. To place an historical date on the Jeschu Ben Pande ra legend is as Mead suggests, a jungle. The oral t radition of the Talmud is estimated by scholars to have been writte n down between 400-600 A.D. The motive to deceive, blind or otherwise conceal the date of the life of Jeschu is best described by Justin Martyr as \"The Jews make war against the Christians as against a foreign nation.\" In the Babylonian Gemara, a story is told twice tha t, \"When King Jannai directed the destruction of th e Rabbis, R. Joshua Ben Perachiach and Jeschu (Ben Pandera) went to Alexandria\". Tannai or Jannaeus (John) was of t he Maccabaean line of Kings and reigned over the Jews at 104-78 B.C. His wife Salome later reigned at 78- 69 B.C. and their rule was generally considered a golden age fo r the Pharisees. If there is any historical basis for the passage, J oshua Ben Perachiach probably fled to Alexandria in 87 B.C. and was recalled in 78 B.C. He exists as an historical character and considered the greatest and most lear ned Rabbi of his time. This would place the age of his student Jesch u in the First Century B.C. Tracing the historical date of the life of Jeschu i n the Toldoth stories is more difficult. The contra diction appears in two popular versions placing Jeschu in the days of Joshua ben Perachiach (as in the Talmud) and anothe r placing him (as in our narrative) in the days of Tiberius a nd Pilate. The reason for this probably arises from the confusion of equating Jesus with Jeschu. They are two different persons living in two difference centuries! In the great medieval debates, inquisitions and persecutions by the Domin icans, the Jews probably confused the issue by asse rting that their Talmud Jeschu was actually the Christian Jesu s, thereby downplaying the Messianic character of J esus, including the virgin birth, the crucifixion and res urrection. Remember, the persecuted were fighting t o save their lives from the worst torture and burning at the sta ke. Also, if the Talmud Jeschu was originally an or al esoteric tradition among the Essenes, it was only a matter o f time before the revealed exoteric version was pro faned. This may in fact be the case with the genealogy of Jesus given by Epiphanius."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The so-called \"Riddle of Epiphanius\" is this. On th e one hand he gives a very clear and unambiguous bi rthday for Jesus as \"The Saviour was born in the forty-second year of Augustus, King of Rome... and on the 6th da y of January after thirteen days of winter solstice and the incr ease of light and day...For it needs must have been that this should be a figure of our Lord, Jesus Christ Himself, and of his twelve disciples, who made up the number of the thirteen days of the increase of the light.\" Epiphanius would count the first year of Augustus ( Octavian) from the date of the death of Julius Caes ar at 44 B.C. and thereby placing the birthdate of Christ in the year of 2 B.C. This birthdate is in close accord wi th the Canonical date of Christ, which custom began with Dionysius E xiguus. On the other hand, Epiphanius gives a contrary birt h date in a polemical he wrote defending the geneal ogy of Jesus coming from the House of David, in fulfillment of b iblical prophecy. In arguing for the unbroken succe ssion from David, he says, \"Now the throne and kingly seat of David is the priestly office in the Holy Church...T he throne of David continued by succession up until that time - namely, till Christ Himself - without any failure f rom the princes of Judah, until it came unto Him...For with the adv ent of the Christ the succession of the Princes of Judah, who reigned until the Christ Himself, ceased...The orde r of succession failed and stopped at that time whe n he was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Alexander, wh o was of high-priestly and royal race; and after hi mself and Salina...a foreign king, Herod, and those who were no longer of the family of David, assumed the Crown .\" Now, this Alexander and Salina are the Greek names for King Jannai and his wife Salome, who succeeded him as discussed in the Babylonian Gemara-Talmud. Together , they reigned from 104 B.C. to 69 B.C., the era of Jeschu Ben Pandera not the era of Christ! Thus, we have the identical problem previously ment ioned in relation to the Toldoth stories wherein Je schu or Jesus was placed in one version in the days of King Janna i and in another version placed in the days of King Herod. This contradiction is more problematical since Epiphaniu s, although a Jew by birth (about 315 A.D.), was a youthful convert to Christianity and canonized a saint by th e Roman Catholic Church for his pious writings on N icene orthodoxy. No other historical writer has placed such an exact date for the birth of Christ (January 6th, etc.) a nd also demanding the birth date as prophecy fulfilled in the transfe r of kingship offices from Jannai to Jesus. In explanation, I suppose it is possible that there was a deliberate mis-translation in the names of J eschu (Ben Pandera) and Jesus. Thus, the transfer of office we nt from Jannai to Jeschu to Joseph to Jesus. This r eason is born out by Mead when he states that the name of Panther (Pandera) was inserted in the genealogy of Jesus w hen Epiphanius otherwise discussed the family history o f Joseph. Joseph, says Epiphanius, was the son of Panther (Pa ndera) and Panther was born about 100 B.C. Now Pant her is a name given for the soldier in several Talmud Jesus stories described as the paramour of the mother of Jesus when she was in separation. We also see the name of Pant hera written by Origen in his polemics against Cels us. Mead says that Panther and Pandera are the one and the s ame person and his research shows that the name Pan thera was erased from the oldest Vatican manuscripts of Orige n. Epiphanius further states that Joseph had four sons and two daughters from his first wife before his s econd marriage to the Virgin Mary. These step-brothers and step-si sters of Jesus were named Jacob, Jose, Simeon, Juda s, Maria and Salome. Jacob became the first Christian bishop and was martyred about 63 A.D. In summary, we see a rather incredulous tale from t he Talmud and Toldoth Jesus stories, and from Epiph anius the genealogy of Joseph and Jesus with step-brothers an d step-sisters of Jesus. Now, deliberately weaving through the confusion and contradictions, let us pick a thread as follows. About 100 B.C. a person named Jeschu Ben Pandera li ved under the kingships of Jannai and Solome. He wa s a close student and pupil of the very learned and respected Rabbi R. Joshua Pen Perachiach with whom he travel led to that great mecca of magic and occult learning Egypt. Aft er stealing the Shem, he travelled throughout Judea performing miracles and gathering a group of apostates numberi ng 310 persons. During Passover week, he rode into Jerusalem on the back of an ass, was betrayed and later kille d with several of his close disciples. His body was hung on a tree and later, when re-discovered, dragged through the streets in public humiliation. He was descendant fr om the priestly line of kings and his son named Joseph bec ame the step-father of Jesus and the wife of the Vi rgin Mary. Joseph had six children prior to his adoption of Je sus and these children became the step-family of Je sus. The traditional gospels, of course, do not relate s uch an incredible tradition, however there are many gospels and other writings not included in our modern New Testa ment. Mead suggests as a partial answer to the ridd le of Epiphanius that, \"He knew of an ancient tradition w hich declared that the Christian derived from the E ssenes, that Jesus himself was an Essene, and that the church fu rther (Epiphanius) wished to safeguard the doctrina l tradition now stereotyped by the Ecumenical decisions at Nica ea, by working into his treatise an argument agains t the 'heretical' tradition, should it ever have the hard ihood to raise its head again\". As we shall see, Me ad was absolutely correct in his remarkable insight into the mind and intent of Epiphanius."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The Boddhisattva Question On the one hand we have to politely say that the To ldoth and Talmud Jesus stories are intentionally mi sleading and scandalous by Christian standards. While on the oth er hand, there is an occult secret hovering around the identity of the man named Pandira. Why would the leading occult ists of the 19th. century, especially Blavatsky and Levi, consider this man named Pandira to be the actual Je sus Christ ? In the 20th. century a solution was offered by Emil Bock who said, \"The fundemental Christological err or of the Theosophists was the confusion of Jesus Christ with Jeschu ben Pandira.\" Even Annie Besant in her book about esoteric christianity said that Jesus was born \"abo ut 105 B.C.\" It was not until the lecture series en titled ESOTERIC CHRISTIANITY given by Dr. Steiner in the years 1911 -12 that he disclosed the true mission if the Bodhi sattva and the errors of the 19th. century occultists. Yes, St einer's ESOTERIC CHRISTIANITY was a direct response to Besant's ESOTERIC CHRISTIANITY in the same sense th at his THEOSOPHY was in direct response to her THE ANCIENT WISDOM. Now that the error had been defined and corrected, why was the source of the error to be found in the Jewish Toldoth and Talmud stories ? Instead of the giving the obvious explanation that comes from common sens e and not occult rocket science, look at the description of t he destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem after the Crucifixion given by Sister Anne Catherine Emmerich: \" Terror fell upon all at the sound if Jesus' death cry, when the earth quaked and the rock neath the cross was split asunder. A feeling of dread pervaded the whole univ erse. The veil of the Temple was on the instant twa in, the dead arose from their graves, the walls in the Temple fe ll, while mountains and buildings were overturned i n many parts of the world...The two great columns at the entranc e of the Holy of Holies in the Temple fell in oppos ite directions...The beam which they supported gave way and the great curtain was, with a hissing noise, r ent from top to bottom so that, opening on either side, it fell. ..The people could now see into the holy of Holies. ..An apparition of the murdered high priest Zacharias was seen...Jerem ias appeared at the alter and uttered words of denunciation...There were about one hundred decease d belonging to all periods of time who arose in bod y from their shattered tombs in Jerusalem.\" Annas and the High Priest Caiaphas were the true co nspirators seeking the death of Jesus. They had bee n secretly plotting against him since the ministry began at th e request of the Pharisees, the Sadducees and the H erodians. Now that their plot for the murder of Jesus prevailed, the words of the crowd, \"Crucify Him\" rang in their ears as the Temple was being rent asunder and the karma of the death of the Son of God descended upon the Jewish r ace. Why the Rabbinic Jesus stories ? \"Annas was so terrified that he became like one ber eft of reason. He fled from corner to corner throug h the most retired apartments of the temple. I saw him moaning and crying, his muscles contracted as if in convul sions...Annus was like one possessed. He was obliged to be confin ed and he never again appeared in public. Caiaphas became like a madman devoured by secret rage...These speeches a nd apparitions in places in which Caiaphas or the p riests alone had access, were HUSHED UP OR DENIED. IT WAS FORBID DEN TO SPEAK OF THEM UNDER PENALTY OF EXCOMMUNICATION.\" Jeschu ben Pandira About forty years before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Rudolf Steiner clearly identified the T of R as well as the spiritual task of the Essene community. In THE GOSPEL OF ST. MATTHEW(1910), he says, \"During the reign of King Alexander Jannaeus (about 103 to 76 B.C.), a certain Individuality was sent into the communities of the Essenes to be their guide and le ader. This Individuality was the leader of the Esse nes about a hundred years before the appearance of Christ Jesus on the Earth. He is also known in Talmudist literature under the name of Jesus, the son of Pandira, Jeschu ben Pandi ra. He was a great and noble personality, about whom inferior Je wish literature has woven all kinds of fables that have been recently revived, and he must not be confused, as s ome Talmudist have confused him, with the 'Jesus of Nazareth'. We also know that he was accused of blasphemy and h eresy by those to whom the teaching of the Essenses were anathema, and after being stoned was hanged on a tr ee, in order to add to the punishment, the stigma o f infamy.\" The purpose of Steiner's disclosure of this 2,000 y ear old occult mystery was to weave the Buddhist st ream into esoteric Christianity. The last physical incarnatio n of the Gautama Buddha occurred about 600 B.C. whe n that individual achieved the rank of Buddhahood and ente red Nirvana. As such, he passed his office as a tea cher of humanity onto his successor who has the rank of Bod hisattva. There are twelve such Bodhisattva's who f orm the White Lodge around the thirteenth, the Christ. Each Bodhisattva is a teacher of humanity until he reac hes the rank of a Buddha, after which he never again incarnates in a physical body. Since 600 B.C., this Bodhisattva, who succeeded the Gautama Buddha has been incarnating o n earth as a representative of the Buddhist esoteri c stream and will do so for the next 2,400 years until he rises to the rank of the next Buddha known as the Maitrey a Buddha."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Steiner says that this Bodhisattva sent Jeschu ben Pandira into the Essene communities to prepare for the two Christ Children birth event. Both the Chaldean mystery sch ool at Babylon and the Essene community at Palestin e knew of the secret teaching of the preparation of the physi cal, etheric and astral bodies through the forty-tw o generations descendant from Abraham. Jeschu Ben Pandira taught this secret to the Essene communities and actually had pupils experience clairvoyantly the descent of the Christ being though the forty-two stages. He taught that t he time was very near when the blood line would be ready for th e incarnation of Zarathustra in the Solomon Jesus C hild. Steiner also confirms the names of the five discipl es of Ben Pandira as preserved correctly in the Tal mud. In addition, he reveals the mission of the disciple Ne tzer as cultivating a secluded Essene sect which la ter in the Bible came to be called Nazareth. Steiner also reveals the mission of the disciple Ma thai and the secret of the gospel of St. Matthew. M athai was that pupil in whom the secret of the preparation of the blood through forty-two generations for the incarna tion of Zarathustra was preserved. This secret is exoterica lly disclosed in the first chapter of the St. Matth ew Gospel wherein the blood line of the Jesus child is traced through the 3 x 14 generations from Abraham to Dav id, David to the Babylonian captivity and then to the birth in B ethlehem. Mathai is also the author of the St. Matthew Gospel . Biblical scholars are quick to forget the histori cal fact that the New Testament Gospels of Mark, Luke and John were w ritten in Greek but the St. Matthew Gospel was writ ten an Aramaic, the language of Christ. Remember, in the f ourth century, St. Jerome was asked by the Churcj B ishops Chromatius and Heliodorus, to compare and translate the Septuagint Greek version with the original Heb rew version preserved by the Nazarenes in their library at Caes ara. Jerome relates that the text was unintelligibl e to him being, composed of secret symbolic script which he could n ot translate (since he was not initiated into the m ysteries). He admits that this genuine apostolic writing was writ ten in Chaldaic language with Aramaic letters \"by t he hand of Matthew himself\" and was intended to be kept secret and not openly written (translated). Thus, this Gospel pre-dates the birth of Christ and the events described in it serve as a pre-configur ation \"according to scripture \"of the birth, life and death of Chris t. In another sense, the life of Jeschu Ben Pandira is a pre- configuration of the life of Christ, which correspo ndence was discussed in a publication by the French scholar Andre Depont-Sommer in 1952 as follows: \"The Galilean Master, as He is presented to us in t he writings of the New Testament, appears in many r espects as an astonishing reincarnation of the Teacher of Righteo usness. Like the latter He preached penitence, pove rty, humility, love of one's neighbour, chastity. Like him, He pre scribed the observance of the Law of Moses, the who le Law, but the Law finished and perfected, thanks to His own r evelations. Like him He was the Elect and Messiah o f God, the Messiah redeemer of the world. Like him He was the object of the hostility of the priests, the party o f the Sadducees. Like him He was condemned and put to death. Like hi m He pronounced judgement on Jerusalem, which was t aken and destroyed by the Romans for having put Him to d eath. Like him, at the end of time, He will be the supreme judge. Like him He founded a Church whose adherents fervently awaited His glorious return\". 4Q448 In a recent issue of the BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGY REVIE W there is an article which confirms the 100 B.C. d ate of Steiner and the lifetime of the Toldoth Jesus un der King Jannaeus. Qumran Scroll No. 4Q448 is a leather fragment about three inches wide and six inches long. It is a psa lm and was originally published in 1977 in untranslated form. It was not translated because it was printed in sem icursiue script which is very difficult to translate. For the past fifteen years, several scholars, including John Str ugnell, have been trying to decipher it. Recently, an acceptable vers ion was published and identified a reference to Kin g Jonathan. Now King Jonathan is the same as King Jannaeus iden tified in the Babylonian Gemara of the Talmud Jesus Stories. Since the above publication of G.R.S. Mead, coins h ave been found in which one side says in Greek, \"Al exander the King\" and on the other side in Hebrew the inscripti on reads,\" King Jonathan\". These coins positively i dentify Alexander Jannaeus as the King Jonathan of the Hasm onean dynasty who reigned between 103 and 76 B.C. Scholars consider this translation significant beca use for the first time a Qumran scroll makes refere nce to an historical figure whose life can be exactly dated t o the first quarter of the first Century B.C. It is important to us because it dates Jeschu Ben Pandira of the Talmud s tories to the reign of King Jannaeus which is in ac cord with the 100 B.C. date given by R. Steiner. The Maitreya Bodhisattva A last clue on the trail of the Bodhisattva comes f rom the unlikely source of the visions of Sister An ne Catherine Emmerich, when (above) describing the destruction o f the Temple says: \"I had also a glimpse of other deceased persons who arose here and there in different parts of the Hol y Land, appeared to their relatives and bore witness to Chr ist's mission. I saw, for instance, Zadoch, a very pious man, who divided all his wealth between the poor and the Tem ple and FOUNDED AN ESSENIAN SECT NEAR HEBRON. He was one of the last prophets before Christ. He h ad waited very earnestly for the appearence of the Messiah, he"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"had many revelations upon the same, and communicati on with the ancestors of the Holy Family. This ZADO CH, who lived about ONE HUNDRED YEARS before Jesus, I s aw arise and appear to several persons in the regio n of Hebron. I saw once that his soul was amoung the fir st to return to his body, and then I saw all those souls walking around with Jesus, as if they had again laid their body down.\" Now it can be said that the name Zadoch bears littl e relationship to the name Jeschu ben Pandira. Howe ver, prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls, Pandira was not only the exoteric but also the only esoteric na me handed down in writing for the name of this Bodhisattva. E ven Dr. Steiner used this name. However, since the discovery of the scrolls, we now know that the T of R was called , MOREH TZEDEK. The term Zadoch as used by Sister Emmerich refers of course to the generic names give n over the generations to High Priests of the Templ e descended from King David's original High Priest, Zadok. The term Tzedek, as in Melchizedek, refers to the Hebre w name of the planetary spirit of Jupiter. That Moreh Tzedek was a High Priest incarnated in t he Zakokite line of Temple priests, seem reasonable . That Sister Emmerich connects \"Zadoch\" to the founding o f an Essene sect and that he lived about 100 years before Christ, is too coincidental to dismiss as a misnome r. There are more than one Bodhisattva's that incarnat e into the stream of the spiritual guidance of mank ind. However, Moreh Tzedek is a very special one in the generatio nal line of the future Maitreya Buddha, which Dr. S teiner said will incarnate again about the beginning of the 20t h. Century. SYMBOLS OF TWELVE-THE ZODIAC The Tropical Zodiac The tropical zodiac is a second ary cycle to that of the sidereal zodiac. Taking th e celestial sphere as one great circle and the earth's sphere a s another great circle, the equator of the earth co incides and is concentric with the celestial equator . the sun in it's apparent eastward motion describes a circle on the celestial sphere we call the eclipt ic. All points of the celestial equator have 0 degrees declination; p oints above the equator have positive declination, ranging from 0 degrees to +90 at the north celestial pole; points below the equator have negative declination, rangin g from 0"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"degrees to -90 at the south celestial pole. The dec lination of the sun during it's annual motion along the ecliptic is positive when above the equator and negative when b elow the equator. In the summertime when the sun is high overhead, the declination is positive and in the wi ntertime, when the overhead arc of the sun is much lower, the declination is negative. This implies that twice du ring the year, its declination is 0 degrees, since it must pass thru 0 degrees in going from positive to negative and vice versa. Thus, the sun is directly on the equator at these two intersections of the circle. If we call these two points the equinoxes, the VERN AL EQUINOX occurs when the sun passes from negative to positive declination (from south to north of the ce lestial equator). This occurs about March 21st each year and is called the \"First of Aries.\" Likewise, the AUTUMNAL EQUINOX occurs when the sun passes from positive t o negative declination (from north to south of the ce lestial equator) and this occurs about September 23 rd each year. The term SOLSTICE (meaning sun-stop) refers to the position of the sun at maximum and minimum declinat ion. When the sun's declination is at a maximum (+23 1/2 degrees) and is directly overhead, this is called the Summer solstice and occurs about July 22nd each year. When the sun's declination is at a minimum (-23 1/2 deg rees), this is called the winter solstice and occurs about Decembe r 22nd each year. The motion of the sun along the path of the eclipti c during the 365 day cycle of the year passes thru a band on constellations called the ZODIAC. As we discussed i n THE SEPTENARY IN THE AGES AND EPOCHS OF MANKIND, each of the 12 constellations within 30 de grees of the celestial equator is divided into equa l parts of a circle of 30 degrees for each house of the zodiac. This is done more for convience since some houses a re shorter or longer than exactly 30 degrees. Taking as a model the sun's motion in declination, thru the 12 houses of the zodiac, the Ancient Wisdo m taught of the Twelve Steps of the Sun. Beginning at the verna l equinox, the first three steps in positive declin ation were the houses of Aries, Taurus and Gemini, leading to the summer solstice. The next three steps in positive d eclination were Cancer, Leo and Virgo, leading to the autumn e quinox. Here the sun's declination passes from posi tive to negative. The next three steps in negative declinat ion were Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius, leading to the winter solstice. The final three steps in negative declina tion were Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces, leading b ack to the vernal equinox. Although the houses are in fact denotated from the geometry of the sidereal zodiac, as opposed to the tropical zodiac, it is an easy step to describe the correspo ndence between the 12 steps in declination and the 12 houses of the sidereal zodiac. However, it is very important to r ealize that the tropical zodiac is an horizontal pa th in latitude describing the suns motion along the plane of the e cliptic, and as such, describes an ANNUAL motion corresponding to the yearly cycle of the seasons of nature. The declination measures only the sun's he ight or altitude, which in turn effects, by degrees of light and heat , the qualities of the four seasons. The yearly cyc le of the tropical zodiac is one of growth-in-spring; expansion-in-sum mer; decay-in-fall and contraction-in-winter. The Sidereal Zodiac Since the tropical zodiac corresponds only to the a nnual motion of the sun in declination, it is a sec ondary cycle to the larger cycle of the sidereal zodiac. If we use the plane of the ecliptic great circle, instead of the celestial equator circle as the fundamental great circle, we create a n ecliptic coordinate system, in which the coordina tes are celestial latitude and celestial longitude. In this way an ob ject in the sky is measured in relation to its dist ance (along the ecliptic) from the vernal point, to the point where the great circle passing thru pole of the ecliptic and thru the object, meets the ecliptic. As a source of measures, the axis between the two f irst magnitude stars of Aldebaran, located in the m iddle of Taurus, and Artares, located in the middle of Scorp io, divide the zodiac in equal halves. Then, using this very visible fixed star axis, 12 fixed star constellations are d efined at 30 degrees each in length around the ecli ptic belt. Thus, against a background of stars, the sidereal zodiac gives a coordinate system for the movements of the sun, moon and planets with a celestial frame of reference of cele stial longitude, instead of the merely horizontal m otion of the sun thru the tropical zodiac."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" Unfortunately, the sun can not be measured against the celestial background, so there is always extrap olation from other planetary positions, such as the full moon, f rom which the sun is always in opposition.

The Planetary Rulers Against this background of the solar sidereal great year, the Ancient Wisdom teaches of the Planetary Rulers of the signs of the zodiac, again a product of the Sumeria n/Chaldean star wisdom. The method is sort of an in corporation of the law of Seven into the law of Twelve such tha t each of the five planets rules two houses and the sun and moon rule one house each, as follows:"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"12 cycles of 2,160 years each Cancer Moon Leo Sun Gemini Mercury Virgo Mercury Taurus Venus Libra Venus Aries Mars Scorpio Mars Pisces Jupiter Sagittarius Jupiter Aquarius Saturn Capricorn Saturn Thus, each astrological age of the sidereal zodiac, lasting 2,160 years, is governed by the spirit of the what the Ancient Wisdom called a Planetary Ruler, whose task is to influence the spiritual guidance of humanity . In a very real sense, they take orders from the above hierarc hy of the Spirits of Form and direct orders to thei r lower hierarchy of Archangels, as leaders of nations. In Christian Esoterism, these planetary rulers are now called th e angelic hierarchy of the Archai, also known as Spirits of P ersonality/Pricipalities/Spirits of the Age. Hegel referred to them as a Time Spirit or Zeitgeist. Christianity, being born in the astrological age of Pisces, is ruled in the superior by Jupiter and in the opposition by Virgo and its ruling planet, mercury. Thus, Christi an symbols of the Fish (Pisces) and the Virgin (Vir go) pre-date those of the cross. In addition, there is the mirac le of the loaves (Virgo was represented by carrying a sheaf of wheat) and fishes and the symbolic Greek name for C hrist as Ichthus, the Fish. The 36 stars of the Sumerian Sun Whereas the tropical zodiac has 12 steps of the sun , the sidereal zodiac has 36 steps of the sun, know n as the decans. Most historians give the origin of the 36 decans to the ancient Egyptians, who modified the original C haldean zodiac, when it was introduced into Alexandria at t he beginning of the Hellenistic age. As evidence of this, one need only look at the circular zodiac found on the ceili ng of the Egyptian temple of Dendera, now in the Lo uvre museum. A later rectangular zodiac was found in the temple of Khnum near Esra, which was subsequently destroye d. It is to me more likely the Chaldean zodiac already contained the decans before it was transmitted to Alexandria. The ancient Sumerian zodiac called UL-HE meant \"shi ny herd' as opposed to the more familiar later Gree k ZODIAKOS KYKLOS meaning \"animal circle.\" Indeed, th e Babylonian zodiac is much older than the 5th cent ury BC date given by Robert Powell and other researcher s. One very obvious reason for the antiquity of the Ba bylonian zodiac was discussed, infra, in David Ulan sey's book, THE ORIGINS OF THE MITHRAIC MYSTERIES. Here he conc lusively proves that the symbol of Mithras slaying of the bull, as depicted in the hundreds of tauroctony figures, was a cosmological symbol for the precessional transition from the age of Taurus to t he age of Aries. This signifies a change in the rul ing planetary Archai. We know from the previous discussion in the AGES OF MANKIND, that the precessional age of Taur us began about 4106 BC and ended in 1946 BC with the c ommencement of the age of Aries. Although the Mithr aic mysteries did not become exoteric until the first c entury AD, scholars, like Franz Cumont, attribute t he source of the cult to the ancient Iranian god Mithra, whose esote ric teachings were later transplanted into the Roma n culture. We know that on the ceilings of the caves where Zar athustra taught his Magi priests were inscribed a c elestial vault with the stars and planets discovered by the Babylo nian star gazers. If Babylonian star wisdom only da tes to the 5th century BC and the Eqyptian Dendera zodiac dates to only 200 BC, why would the Mithras cult worship a symbol whose astrological orgin dates to the age of Taurus in 4106 BC ? Not very likely, in fact, any cultura l nation which recognizes the \"religious ages of mankind\" must kno w prima facie of the phenomenon of the precession o f the equinoxes. As I have said many times elsewhere, if the Greek astronomer Hipparchus really was the firs t to discover the precession cycle in the year 128 BC, then why d id he call it the \"great Platonic Year\", when Plato was already 300 years dead ? In fact, the Babylonians inherited the their star w isdom from the ancient Sumerian culture, who were t he true star worshipers. Around the turn of this century, severa l professors (Pinches, Langdon and Jeremias) recons tructed from Sumerian tablets a complete Mesopotanian astrolabe. It was a disk of the great celestial circle within which were three concentric circles divided in sections of twe lve units. Some 50 years later, Van der Waerden wro te a paper called BABYLONIAN ASTRONOMY: THE 36 STARS. The thre e concentric circles represent the three divisions of the modern celestial sphere, the northern, centr al and southern. The central band of 30 degrees abo ve and below the equator which the Sumerians called the \"way of Anu\", represented the band of the constellations of our familiar zodiac. Along this band, the tablets list 26 major stars visible along the tropic of Cancer giving dis tances in three different measurements. One of these measurements i s a distance in degrees of an arc from a division o f the circle into 12 double hours of 30 degrees each, similar to our modern celestial sphere which measures the sid ereal zodiac. Sumerian motifs of the bull and lion suggest symbol s for the vernal equinox in Taurus and the summer s olstice in Leo. Most artifacts show the beginning of their chr onological vernal point to lie in Taurus, which we know to begin 4106 BC. One tablet in the Berlin museum begins the ir list of zodiac houses in Leo, which puts their c hronological"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"record in the last astrological age of the Atlantea n root race. One poem from their New Years rituals says \" the constellation Lion that measured the waters of the deep.\" We know that the deluge of the Biblical floo d occurred at the end of the astrological Lion age of Leo in the seventh and last cultural epoch of Atlantean civili zation. The three concentric circles of 12 units each name 36 celesti al bodies and give a series of numbers that add up to 360 degrees. Here was born the 36 decans. While the Egyptians ma y have invented astrology in Hellenistic Alexandria , there is no doubt that astronomy was invented in Sumerian te mples many thousands of years prior to the Egyptian zodiac. The decans are 36 steps of the sun of 10 degrees ea ch for a total of 360 degrees in the celestial grea t circle. Within each house, they are marked 1,2 and 3 so that the f irst decan in Aries is Aries-1, the second is Aries -2, etc. Thus, for each house, there is a front, middle and end. The H ermetic purpose of the subdivision of each zodiacal house into decans was to assign to each house three Planetary Rulers, the same planetary spirits of the second An gelic Hierarchy we saw above in the septenary assignment of Planetary Rulers to the 12 astrological ages of mankind. In the Chaldean order, they are again, Saturn, Jupiter , Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury and Moon. Where ever th e sequence of the decans begins, repeating the sequence five t imes results in (7 X 5 = 35) one decan being left o ver. Traditionally, the extra decan is assigned to the f irst decan of Aries, with Mars as the Ruler. See th e attached plat for the sequence. Thus, against the background of the solar sidereal great year of 25,920 years, there is FIRST, the inf luence of the 7 Planetary Rulers (Spirits of the Age) who rule the astrological ages of 2,160 years each and which pre dominate over the Decans. SECOND, there is the cooperative influe nce of the Planetary Rulers of the 36 decans, who r ule within the astrological ages for 720 years each, in cooper ation with the Archangelic Rulers (below). In Chris tian Esoterism, these subordinate rulers are called Archangels, lea ders of nations, and they take orders from the Spir its of the Age from above and pass orders below to the hierarchy o f Angels, who lead individual men. Both cycles are an example of the cooperative influences of spirits within the first Angelic Hierarchy who guide the spiritual ev olution of humanity. Arch-Angels of the Mystical Chronology Now, there is a third subordinate cycle within the decans of the Archangels, which is difficult to rec oncile as a septenary within the twelvefold zodiac. In 1508 the re was written a \"little book on mystical chronolog y mystical chronology\" by a certain Johannes Trithemius (1462- 1516), Abbott of Sponheim. JOHANNES TRITHEMIUS 1462-1516 Abbot of Sponheim A TREATISE ON THE SEVEN SECONDARY CAUSES, I.E., INTELLIGENCES, OR SPIRITS, WHO MOVE THE SPHERES ACCORDING TO GOD A Little Book or MYSTICAL CHRONOLOGY Containing within a Short Compass Marvellous Secret s Worthy of Interest To the august and pious Maximilian I, Emperor & Cae sar by the Grace of God: Most wise Emperor, this lower world, created and or ganized by the First Intelligence, who is God, is r uled by Secondary Intelligences. Hermes, who gave us the sc ience of the Magi, confirms this view when he says that seven Spirits were assigned to the seven Planets from the beginning of the heavens and of the earth. Each of these Spirits rules the universe in turn fo r a period of 354 years and 4 months. Many learned scholars, up to the present day, have approved this assertion, whic h I do not guarantee, but only lay before your Most Blessed Majesty. The first Angel or Spirit, that of Saturn, is calle d Oriphiel God confided the government of the world to him starting with the beginning of creation. Oriphiel's reign be gan on March 15 and lasts 354 years and 4 months. T he name Oriphiel was given to him on account of his spiritu al office, not his nature. Under his rule, humans w ere crude and savage. Their customs recalled those of wild beasts of the wilderness. This requires no demonstration, for it is clearly evident from the Book of Genesis. The second guiding Spirit of the world was Anael, t he Spirit of Venus, who, following Oriphiel, began to emit stellar influence in the year of the world 354, on June 24. Anael ruled the world for 354 years and 4 months until the year of creation 708, as calculation shows. Under A nael's rule, human beings began to be less crude. T hey built houses and cities, invented manual arts, and began the twin arts of the weaving and spinning of yarn. They also gave themselves up to the pleasures of the flesh and too k wives. Forgetting God, they grew distant in many things from natural simplicity, invented games and songs, set t hemselves to playing the kithara and imagined all t hat had to do"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"with Venus and her cult. This life of debauchery en ded only with the deluge that was the punishment fo r their depravity. The third ruler, Zachariel, the Angel of Jupiter, b egan to rule the world in the year 708 after the cr eation of the heavens and the earth, in the eighth monththat is, on October 26. Zachariel ruled the universe for 354 years and 4 months until the year 1060. Under Zachariel's direc tion humans began to take turns usurping power. The y began to hunt, to put up tents, to decorate their bodies wit h different kinds of clothes. The good were separat ed from the evil the good invoked God, like Enoch who entered into H im, while the evil plunged into pleasures of the fl esh. Under Zachariel, people began to live in society, to subm it to laws imposed upon them by the strongest among them and, distancing themselves from their earlier barbarism, to civilize themselves. It was under Zachariel's r ule that Adam, the first human being, died, leaving to posterity t he inevitability of death. Lastly, in these days, s everal human inventions occurred, curious arts, as historians te ll us. The fourth ruler of the world was Raphael, the Spir it of Mercury, whose rule began on February 24 of t he year 1063 following the creation of the earth and the heavens , and lasted 354 years and 4 months. The invention of writing goes back to this period. To begin with, letters we re imagined in the forms of trees and plants, later taking on more careful forms to be mod)fied at will. Under Raphael , the use of musical instruments spread; commerce a nd trading were practiced, as well as long-distance navigation , and many other marvelous things. The fifth ruler of the world was Samael, the Angel of Mars, who began to reign on June 26, 1417. Samael ruled for 354 years and 4 months and impress ed his influence strongly upon humanity. Under Sama el's reign, in the year of the world 1656, the universal flood occurred, as the Book of Genesis clearly sho ws. It is a remarkable fact, as the ancient philosophers tell u s, that each time Samael, the Genius of Mars, gover ns the world, a complete change occurs in some great monarchy: reli gions and castes are overturned; great persons and princes are exiled; laws are changed as one can easily see in t he historians. Such changes do not occur right at t he beginning of Samael's reign, but only as it enters its second ha lf. The same is true for all the other planetary Sp irits, as history shows. That is, the influence of the secondary powe rs reaches its height when the stars reach the zeni th of their revolution. The sixth ruler of the world was Gabriel, Angel of the Moon. Gabriel began his reign after that of Sam ael, the Spirit of Mars, on October 28, 1771 years after the creati on of the world. Gabriel's rule lasted 354 years an d 4 months until the year 2126. During this period human beings mult iplied further and founded many new cities. It must be noted, too, that, according to the Hebrews, the Flood occu rred under the rule of Mars in the year of the worl d 1656. Isidore and Beda, two interpreters of the Septuagint, on th e other hand, claim that this cataclysm occurred in the year 2242 that is, under the rule of Gabriel, Spirit of the M oon, which by calculation seems to me closer to the truth, though this is not the place to prove it. The seventh ruler of the world was Michael, the Ang el of the Sun, whose rule began, according to ordin ary calculation, on February 24 in the year 2126 after the creation, and finished 354 years and 4 months l ater in the year 2480. Under the rule of this Angel of the Sun, acco rding to those historians most worthy of belief, Ki ngs first began to appear among mortals, and among these was Nimrod , the first to use sovereign power to tyrannize his fellows who were devoured by passions. Thus human folly ins tituted the cult of the Gods. Humans began to worsh ip the lower principles as Gods. At this time, too, humani ty invented various arts: Mathematics, Astronomy, M agic. The cult of a single God was practiced by different cre atures but, due to human superstition, knowledge of the true God was gradually forgotten. At this time, likewise, ag riculture began to be practiced and human beings be gan to have more civilized customs and institutions. In eighth place, Oriphiel, the Angel of Saturn, ret urned and ruled the universe again for 354 years an d 4 months- from June 26, 2480 until September, 2834. Under thi s Angel's rule, nations multiplied, the earth was d ivided into regions, and many kingdoms were founded. The Tower of Babel was built and \"the confusion of tongues\" o ccurred. Thus humanity dispersed over the earth and human be ings began energetically to work the soil and culti vate fields, to sow wheat and plant vines, to prune fruit trees and busy themselves with all that concerned food an d clothing. From this moment on, the distinction of nobility be gan to manifest and those who excelled by their vir tue and genius received the insignia they deserved from their prin ces. At this time, too, humanity began to gain a se nse of the universe as a whole, as, after the multiplication o f races and the founding of many kingdoms, differen t languages came into being. Then, in ninth place, the Spirit of Venus, Anael, b egan to rule the world once more. This was on Octob er 29 in the year 2834 after the creation of the heavens and the earth. Anael ruled for 354 years and 4 months unti l the year of the world 3189. During this period, human beings, f orgetting God, began to create a cult of the Dead. They began to worship the Dead and their statues in place of God. This was an error that lasted more than two thousan d years. Fashion introduced the use of precious orn aments for the body and, with the help of different sorts of m usical instruments, humanity abandoned itself once again to the"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"passions and pleasures of the flesh, raising these up and even dedicating statues and temples to them. During this time Zoroaster, the first King of the Bactrians and other peoples, defeated in battle by Ninus, King o f the Assyrians, discovered the mystery of incantations and curses. In tenth place, Zachariel, the Angel of Jupiter, to ok up the direction of the world. This was on the l ast day of February in the year 3189 after the foundation of t he heavens and the earth. Zachariel ruled for 354 y ears and 4 months, until the year 3543. This was a happy perio d, known with reason as the \"Golden Age.\" The abund ance of all the earth's goods led to the increase of the human species and the universe reached the height of its splendor. During this period, God gave Abraham the law of circumcisi on, promising for the first time the redemption of humanity by the incarnation of his only Son. Under Zachariel's rule, the Patriarchs, those founders of the spirit of justice, appeared. By their will and their works, the just w ere separated from the unjust. During this time, to o, Jupiter, under the name of Lisanius, King and Son of Heaven and of God, was the first to give laws to the Arcadians, succeeding in civilizing them, building temples, instituting a pr iestly craft, and gaining many useful things for hi s people. This was why they gave him the name of Jupiter and, after hi s death, looked on him as a God. Yet he originated in the priestly caste of Heber, as history declares. It is also sai d that during this Angel's rule Prometheus, son of Atlantus, created humanity because, finding them coarse, he made them learned, human, good, and accomplished in manners and customs. He also invented the art of animating imag es. And it was he who first used the ring, the scep ter, and the diadem, and invented royal insignia. At the same ti me, other sages of the race of Jupiter united men a nd women with the bonds of marriage, and brought humanity many ot her useful things. On account of their wisdom, afte r their death, these sages were raised into the ranks of th e Gods. Of this kind were: Phoroneus, who was the f irst to give the Greeks laws and justice, Apollo, Minerva, Ceres, Se rapis (among the Egyptians), and countless others. In eleventh place, Raphael, the Spirit of Mercury, resume.d the guidance of the world again on July 1, in the year of the world 3543, ruling 354 years and 4 months until the year 3897 from the creation of the world. [Dur ing this period, as ancient historians clearly show, humanit y yielded with ardor to the study of wisdom. Among the most illustrious of these devotees of wisdom were: Mercu rius, Bacchus, Omogyrus, Isis, Inachus, Argus, Apol lo, Cecrops, and many others who, by their discoveries, were useful to the world and to posterity. During this time, too, various superstitions arose in humankind, such as t he cult of idols, incantations, and the art of prod ucing diabolical prodigies. Everything generally attributable to the subtlety and genius of Mercury took on vast propor tions. Moses, the most wise leader of the Hebrews, the expert in many sciences and in all the arts, priest of the so le and true God, delivered his people from the slavery in which the Egyptians had kept them. At this same time, Janus t he First ruled over Italy; Saturn, who taught the manuring of fiel ds and was taken for a God, succeeded him. About th is time, too, Cadmus invented the Greek letters and Carmetis, dau ghter of Evander, Latin letters. It was also in the reign of Raphael, Angel of Mercury, that the All-Powerful ga ve his people by the intermediary of Moses, the Law to which the Incarnation of CHRIST gave a dazzling testimony . A prodigious variety of cults manifested in the w orld. There were then numerous Sibyls, Prophets, Augurs, Harusc ipes, Magi, Diviners, not to mention the Sibyls of Erythrea, Delphi, and Phrygia. In the twelfth epoch, Samael, Angel of Mars, became the world's ruler for a second time. This was on O ctober 2 of the year of the world 3897. Samael ruled 354 years and 4 months until the year 4252. Under his reign, the great and celebrated destruction of Troy in Asia Minor occurr ed. Monarchies and many kingdoms fell and new ones were founded, such as Paris, Mainz, Carthage, Naples, an d others. New kingdoms, too, arose, such as that of Lacedemon, Corinth, Jerusalem, . During this period, long wars and great struggles o f Kings and nations unfolded, as well as dynastic c hanges. The Venetians, for example, trace the origin of their p eople and the founding of their city to this period of the taking of Troy. More remarkably still, several nations of Eur ope and Asia lay claim to Trojan descent-but in the desire to glorify themselves, as if there had not existed fam ous people and nations in Europe before the ruin of Troy, the proofs they offer in support of the nobility of the ir origin are vain and deceptive. Under the dominion of this same planet, Mars, Saul, the First, was chosen King of the Jews. After him came David, then his son Solomon, who built to the true God a T emple in Jerusalem that was famous throughout the w orld. Then the Divine Spirit, illuminating its prophets with t he incomparable clarity of grace, gave them not onl y the gift of predicting the future incarnation of the Savior, bu t also many other things, as the Holy Scriptures at test. Among these prophets, we may cite Nathan, son of King Dav id, Gad, Azaph, Achaias, Semeias, Azarias, Anan, an d many others. The Greek poet Homer, singer of the Fall of Troy, the Phrygian Dares and the Cretan Dictis who witnessed and told of it, are also said to have lived at this time. For the thirteenth period, Gabriel, the genius of t he Moon, resumed the rulership of the world on Janu ary 30 of the year 4252 from the world's beginning. Gab~iel ruled 354 years and 4 months, until the year 4606. Durin g this period several great prophets shone among the Hebrews: Eli sha, Micah, Abdiah, and others. Among the Hebrews, likewise, Kings succeeded each other with rapidity. Lycurgus gave the Spartans a code and laws. Capitus, Liberiu s, Romulus,"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"and Procas Sylius, and Numitor-Italian Kings-flouri shed under this Spirit's reign. Under this same Lun ar influence a number of other kingdoms arose, such as those of th e Lydians, the Medes, the Macedonians, the Spartans , etc., while the Assyrian monarchy was ended by Sardanapalus. Th e Kingdom of Media also disappeared. At this time, many different kinds of laws were imposed upon humanity. Human beings neglected the worship of God. The cul t of idols became widespread. In 4491, the 239th year of Gabrz el's reign, the foundations of Rome were laid. The dominion of the Sylians ended in Italy, their place being taken by the Romans. Around this time, too, the Seven Sa ges appeared in Greece: Thales, Solon, Cheilon, Periander, Cleob ulus, Bias of Priene, and Pittacus. From this momen t on, philosophers and poets began to be held in high est eem. Romulus, founder of Rome, fratricide, and abet tor of sedition, ruled the city for 37 years. His successo r, Numa Pompilius, ruled for 42 years, developing t he cult of the Gods and dying in the time of Ezechias, King of the Jews. Toward the end of Gabriel 's rule, Nebuchadn ezzar, King of Babylon, captured and destroyed Jerusalem and le d King Sedecias and his people into captivity. The prophet Jeremiah foretold both this destruction and the end of this captivity. Following Gabriel, on May 1 of the year of the worl d 4606, Michael, the Spirit of the Sun, took up the world's scepter for the second time. Michael ruled the univ erse for 354 years and 4 months, until the year 496 0 of the world's foundation. During his period, Merodach, Ki ng of Babylon, gave the Hebrew people their liberty and their King. This was under the influence of Michael, who, as the book of Daniel tells, protected the dews wh om God had given him. At this time, too, the Persian monarchy arose whose first Kings, Darius and Cyrus, overturn ed the great Babylonian monarchy. This was in the reign of Balth asar, as Daniel and the prophets predicted. The Cum aean Sibyl was also famous then, because of the offer she made to King Tarquin the Elder to sell him at once, and at the same price, the nine books containing the series of pred ictions having to do with the Roman Republic. When the King refused to pay the price that was asked, the Sybil burnt the first three books before his eyes, and th en demanded the same sum for the remaining six. Refused again, she threw three more books into the fire, and would hav e done the same for the last three, had not the King, persuade d by his Counsellors, saved these books from destru ction by agreeing to pay the price asked in the beginning fo r the set of nine. These same Romans, after the exp ulsion of their Kings, designated two Consuls annually. This was th e period when Phalaris, the tyrant, ruled in Sicily . Magic was held in great esteem at this time among the Kings o f Persia. Pythagoras and other philosophers flouris hed in Greece. The city of Jerusalem and its Temple were reconstru cted. The prophet Esdras restored from memory the B ooks of Moses, which had been burnt by the Chaldeans. This new text was called the Babylonian version. Xerxes, King of Persia, led an army against the Greeks, but without great effect. The Gauls captured, burned, and dest royed Rome, except for the Capitol which was saved by a goose w ho awoke the sleeping soldiers with his honking. Th e Athenians were then engaged in their famous wars an d the philosophers Socrates and Plato gained their renown. Following the repeal of the Consuls, the Romans ins tituted the offices of the Tribunes and the Aediles . Meanwhile, a host of calamities assailed them. Immediately following the end of Michael's dominion , Alexander the Great ruled in Macedonia; he overca me the Persian monarchy under Darius, and brought all Asia under his scepter, as well as a part of Europe. He died at the age of 33, after a reign of 12 years and 5 months. Many wars and ills followed his death and his empir e was dismembered into four parts. Among the Hebrews, com petitions were held for the High Priesthood for the first time. And the Kingdom of Syria was born. After Michael, Oriphiel, the Spirit of Saturn, took up the government of the world for the third time (and the fifteenth period) on the last day of September in t he year 4960 from the beginning of the world. He ru led for 354 years and 4 months, until the year 5315. Under his rule, the Punic Wars began between the Romans and t he Carthaginians. The city of Rome was almost complete ly destroyed by fire and water. The Colossus, a bro nze sculpture, 126 feet high, was toppled by an earthqu ake. After the Punic War, Rome, which had warred un ceasingly for 440 years, enjoyed a year of peace. Jerusalem a nd its Temple were burnt and destroyed by Antiochus and Epiphanes. The Maccabees became famous for glorious battles. During this period, too, 606 years after the founding of Rome, Carthage was destroyed and burned for seve nteen days. In Sicily, the revolt of the 70,000 sla ves against their masters occurred. Great wonders took place at this time in Europe. Domestic animals fled into th e woods, blood flowed, and an exploding ball of fire fell fr om the sky with a great din. Mithridates, King of P ontus and Armenia, waged a war against Rome for 40 years. The Kingdom of the Hebrews was restored, after a hiatu s lasting 575 yearsfrom Zedechias to Aristobulus. The Germans and the Teutons invaded Italy and were defeated af ter many battles, losing 160,000 men, not counting the consi derable number of those who perished with their fam ilies under Caius and Manlius, after having treacherously kille d many Romans. Finally, 40 years of civil war desol ated Italy. Three suns appeared in Rome, melting, after a short time, into one. A few years later,Julius Caesar us urped the supreme power, and following him Augustus extended his power into Asia and Africa, uniting these under a single rule. Augustus ruled for 36 years, during which God gave the world peace."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"In the year of the world 5199, the 751st year of Ro me's foundation, the 42nd year of Octavius Caesar A ugustus, 245 years into the reign of Oriphiel, the Spirit of Sat urn, the eighth month, on December 25, Jesus Christ , the Son of God, was born of the Virgin Mary, in Bethlehem, inJ udea. Note that by the admirable ordering of divine Providence, the universe was created in the first rulership of Oriphiel or Saturn and was saved, restored, and ren ewed by his mercy during his third administrationa harmonious a greement which aufficiently proves the influence of the seven planets on the government of the universe. Indeed, during Oriphiel's first rulership, the whole world formed but a single, vast monarchy, which, during his second rul ership, subdivided into a multitude of little kingd omsas we have shown abovewhich themselves were brought into unity once again under his third rulership. This notwith standing, it is clear to those with clairvoyant eyes that the se cond period of Oriphiel also saw a single monarchy with the building of the Tower of Babel. During this third r eign of Oriphiel the Kingdom of the dews was scatte red and the perpetual sacrifice of victims was suspended. And f reedom will not be given to the Jews again until th e third period of Michael in August 1880 of the Christian Era, whi ch is the year of the world 7170. In the year 299 o f the Angel Oriphiel's rulership, Peter transferred the great O ffice of the Pontiff of the Universal Christian Chu rch from Judea to Rome. Many Jews and Gentiles embraced the Christian religion on account of the preaching of sermons of great simplicity and un-sophistication, illuminated not b y human knowledge but by the Spirit of God. The wor ld at this moment returned to the innocence and simplicity of the first age. In both, Oriphiel, Spirit of Saturn, presided. The heavens were united with the earth. Two scepters we re given to humanity to rule the world: a higher on e, for spiritual things, was given to the Pope; another, f or temporal things, was given to the Emperor. Many Christians, persecuted by the princes of this world, perished f or their faith. Toward the end of Oriphiel's reign, the Romans destroyed Jerusalem, and the Jews were scattered ov er all the earth: 110,000 were killed; 80,000 were sold; and the rest fled. In this way, Rome completely destroyed J udea. In sixteenth place, after Oriphiel, Anael, Spirit o f Venus, took up the direction of the universe for the third time on the last day of January, 5315 years from the founda tion of the heavens and the earth, 109 years after Christ's Nativityto rule for 354 years and 4 months to the y ear of the world 5669 and 4 months, which is the ye ar 463 of the Lord's incarnation. We may note that, during almost this entire reign of the Angel of Venus, the Chris tian Church increased amidst persecutions, and finally prevaile d after thousands were murdered for their faith in Christ. Numerous heresies then arose in the bosom of the Ch urchheresies that were extinguished from the blood of the virtuous only with great trouble and after much tim e. At that time, too, numerous people arose who wer e celebrated in all branches of knowledge: theologians, astronom ers, doctors, orators, historiansnot only among the gentiles but also among Christians. The faithless finally stoppe d persecuting the Church after Constantine the Grea t was baptized in the year of the world 5539 when the Angel of Ven us, Anael had passed the culminating point of its c ycle of dominion. After this there were still some troubles caused by impious people, but the Church generally lived in peace. During this period, the human race which, si nce the time of King Ninus had been miserably lost in the cult of idols for 2,300 years, was mercifully brought back to knowledge of the one God. Many subtle arts grew up and, in agreement with the nature of Venus, developed and e mbellished themselves. For human manners change wit h the times and things below correspond with things above , and receive their influence. The soul, besides, i s free, and not under the influence of the stars, unless it bec omes stained, being too attached to the body, and a llows itself to be guided by the latter. For the Angels, engines of th e orbs, can neither destroy nor alter anything esta blished by nature. A huge comet announced the death of Constantine. Th e Arian heresy troubled the Holy Church in many pla ces. Toward the end of Anael's rule, in the time of the Emperor Julian, crosses appeared on the linen robes of certain per sons. In Asia and Palestine, wars, plagues, and fam ines followed the apparitions in which these crosse s were seen. In these days, too, around the year 360 of the Christi an Era, the Franks came out of Germany and invaded, occupied, and conquered Gaul, to which they gave their name. France was great and large, and its capital was Mai nz (Herbipolis). Bavarians, Swabians, Saxons, Thuringi ans, the inhabitants of the Rhine, and the tribes s urrounding the Papal Kingdom occupied the greater part of what was then France and which today includes Germany. 280 years into this reign of Anael, the Roman Empire began it s decline. Its capital, Rome, was cap tured and bur ned by the Goths. This was after Constantine had moved the sea t of the Empire to Byzantium, a fatal deed that cau sed the decadence of the entire monarchy. Indeed, toward th e end of Anael's rule, there appeared, as historian s tell, Radagif, Alaric, and Athaulfe, Kings of the Goths, who were soon followed by Ganseric, King of the Vandals, and Attila, King of the Hunsall of whom invaded the whole of Eu rope and cut the Empire into pieces. Following Anael, and in seventeenth place, Zacharie l, Spirit of Jupiter, took up the direction of the world for the third time on June 1 of the year of the world 5669, which is the year 463 after the Birth of the Savio r. He ruled for 354 years and 4 months, to the year of the world 60 23, which is the year of the Savior 817. During the se days, many people gave themselves passionately to the study of Christian philosophy. Many wonders occurred: comet s, earth quakes, rainfalls of blood."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Merlin, who was born in Caledonia at the beginning of Zachariel's rule, made astonishing predictions. Arcturus, commonly called Arthur, most famous King of Britain , overcame the barbarians, brought peace to the Chu rch, triumphed in many battles, spread abroad the Christ ian faith, and brought all of Gaul, Norway, Dacia, as well as several provinces, under his rule. Arthur was the m ost glorious prince of his time; after accomplishin g many high deeds, he suddenly disappeared, and for many years the Britons awaited his return. Many poets sang of his prodigious exploits; under his rule, England flouri shed and commanded three times ten kingdoms. In these days, the monastic Orders began to multipl y in God's Church. Theodoric, King of the Arian Got hs, conquered Italy. The Empire and the Church were in trouble. Zeno and Anastasius, the Emperor of the Ea st, Theodoric and his successors in Italy, Honorius, Ki ng of the Vandals in Africa-all these exercised an unequaled tyranny. Clovis, King of the Franks of Gaul, was ba ptized, overcame the Goths, and imposed peace, thou gh not in the whole world. This was in the time of St. Benedi ct, around the year 500 of the Christian Era, towar d the opening of the reign of Zachariel, the Angel of Jupiter; wh ose influence led to changes of dynasties and kingd oms, as the historians repeatedly affirm. What this Angel canno t do himself, he leaves to his successor Raphael, A ngel of Mercury, who put Charlemagne on the throne of Franc e. Indeed, during Zachariel's 350 years many empire s crumbled, including those of the Goths, the Vandals , the Burgundians, the Lombards, the Thuringians, t he Germans, the Bavarians, and many others. The Emperor Justini an was the first to give the Republic a coherent se t of laws. Several eminent people gained renown under Zacharie l. Justinian built the basilica of Sancta Sophia in Constantinople. The Empire, divided, was in trouble and confusion. Many omens appeared, as history tel ls. Kusro, King of the Persians, took Jerusalem. Later, he was assassinated by Heracles. At this time, around the year 600 of the Christian Era, the Arab Mohammed founded the se ct of the Saracens. This would soon completely supp lant the Roman Empire in Asia. Dagobert, King of France, con quered and destroyed the English, then called the \" Saxons.\" It must be noted that soon afterward the Christian faith began to weaken in Asia and Africa, while the sect of the Saracens gradually penetrated everywhere, soon cove ring the whole world, with the exception of Europe, where the Order of St. Benedict spread the Christian religion . Toward the year of our Lord 774, crosses appeared on some people's clothing and, a little later, the Roman Em pire was divided, one part passing into Frankish ha nds under Charlemagne. This prince restored the Church and fo ught many wars. After his victories, the name \"West ern Gaul\" was given to the Saxon territory. In eighteenth place, following Zachariel (the Angel of Jupiter) Raphael (the Spirit of Mercury) assume d the government of the world for the third time on Novem ber 2, 6023 years after the world's foundation, whi ch is the year 817 of the Savior's birth. Raphael ruled the u niverse for 354 years and 4 months, until the year of the world 6378, which is the year of our Lord 1171. At the be ginning of this period of Mercury, as we have said, the Roman Empire passed into the hands of Charlemagne. After him, his son Louis reigned for 25 years; after his death his sons fought against each other, thus weakening the Empir e yet again. The Normans devastated Gaul. Twice, Ro me was sacked by the Saracens. It rained blood for three d ays under Louis II. In Saxony, a whole town, with a ll its buildings and inhabitants, was swallowed up in a terrible aby ss opened up by an earthquake. Toward the year of o ur Lord 910 great troubles arose in Italy, which left the Frank ish Empire and chose its own Kings. The first was B erenger, Prince of Friuli, who was followed by seven Kings in a spa ce of about fifty yearswhen the Empire passed to th e Germans. The first Emperor was Otto I, who undertook to reco nstruct the monarchy. Otto II, his son, and Otto III, his nephew, the suc cessors on the imperial throne, converted the Hunga rian people to the Christian faith. In the year 1000 of the Christ ian Era, Otto III, who died with out progeny, estab lished the Electors of the Empire, as has been conserved even to our own days. The Saracens took Jerusalem again. Many omens were seen in the sky, the air, on the ea rth, the sea, and in the waters. Following the deat h of Otto III, Henry I was elected by the princes to succeed him. Henry I reigned 20 years and founded the Church of Bamberg. At the same time, Kunegund, his wife, died a virgin , famous for her miracles. After Henry, Konrad I wa s elected Emperor. He reigned 20 years. At this time also God efroy, Count of Bouillon, dispersed the infidels fr om Jerusalem and the Holy Land. Before the end of Raphael's rule , many omens and numerous signs were seen; and, a l ittle later, the Tartar race left its frontiers and inflicted gr eat evils on the Roman Empire. Famines, plagues, ea rthquakes, and other calamities befell the Empire. In the year of our Lord 1153, Frederick I, called Barbarossa, assu med the scepter. He reigned for 33 years beginning in the 336th year of Raphael's rulership and accomplished many admir able things. He increased the power of his Empire and successful ly undertook many wars. Under his reign, the Egians and the Lithunians embraced Christianity. In nineteenth place, Samael, the Angel of Mars, too k up for the third time the governance of the world on March 3 of the year of the world 6378. He ruled 354 years a nd 4 months, until the year of the world 6732, or t he year of the Lord 1525. Under his rulership there were many wars in the world; thousands of people perished, and se veral kingdoms lost their borders. The Emperor Frederick I had many differences with the Princes of Italy; h e waged great"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"wars against them in which they perished in the tho usands. He ravaged Milan from top to bottom. Liege was destroyed. Jerusalem was taken again by the Saracen s. The Empire of the Tartars grew greatly on the face of the earth. This was a true calamity for the worl d-and continues still today. After Frederick, his son Henry was ele cted Emperor. And on Henry's death a schism between Philip and Otto divided the Empire, causing great troubles. Ma ny battles were fought on the German bordersat Arge ntine, Cologne, Leiden, Spires in Wurtemburg and throughou t the kingdom. The Order of Mendicants was founded during this epoch, in the fortieth year or so of Samael, w hich shows that all things are providential. In Asi a and Africa, the Saracens fought the Christians in numerous places. Constantinople was taken by the Germans, and Baudoi n, Count of Flanders, was raised to imperial dignity. More t han 20,000 German children, seduced by Iying speech es into trying to reconquer the Holy Land, were carried off by pirates on the open sea. A group of shepherds f rom Spain approached Paris, seizing the property of the clerg y, much to the delight of the peoplebut when they s ought to seize the possessions of lay people, they were massacred. In 1212 (of the Christian Era), Frederick II was e lected Emperor; he reigned 33 years and did many things ag ainst the Church. In 1238, there was an eclipse and continuous earthquakes destroyed thousands of people. Frisia w as almost completely submerged and more than 100,00 0 people drowned. The Tartars devastated Hungary and Poland, and conquered Armenia and several other countries. In the year l244 of the Christian Era, a Jew, digging in t he ground near Toledo, found a book in which it was written that Christ would be born of the Virgin Mary in the thir d world and would suffer for the salvation of human ity; he converted immediately and was baptized. The third w orld, i.e., the third period of the Spirit of Satur n, was, as we have shown, when Christ was born of a Virgin. Durin g this period of Samael, the Roman pontiffs, deposi ng the Emperor Frederick, left the imperial throne empty f or 28 years until the election of Rudolf, Count of Hamburg, who was chosen in favor of the other princely candidate s: Henry, Count of Schwarzenburg in Thuringia; Will iam, Count of Holland; Konrad, Frederick's son; Alphonzo, King of Castiile; and Richard, Count of Cornwall, broth er of the King of England. Ills multiplied upon the earth. Th en, around the year of our Savior 1260, the Swiss C onfederation was born, a small country that was to grow with tim e. Because its people were warlike, it attacked oth er nations and thus extended its borders. This made all Germany kn ow of the existence of this new republic. Then, in the year 1273 of the Christian Era, the Assembly of Imperial Prin ces elected Rudolf of Hapsburg. He ruled for 18 yea rs, prudent and wise in many things. All the Dukes of Austria d escend from him. The Tartars invaded the Christian lands, seizing Constantinople and Greece, and causing much damage. The Saracens took several cities in Asia, killing more than 400 Christians. Upon the death of Rudolf, Adolf of Nassau was elected Emperor and ruled for 6 years. Albert, Rudolf's son, defeated him at Worms and, af ter killing him, was elected in his place in 1298. After ruling 10 years, he was himself killed by his brother's son. The Order of the Templars was destroyed on the orde rs of Pope Clement V. The island of Rhodes was taken by the Sa racens following an uninterrupted siege lasting 4 y ears. After the assassination of Albert by his nephew, Henry VI II, Count of Luxemburg, was named Emperor and ruled 5 years. After him, Louis IV of Bavaria was Emperor for 32 y ears, beginning in 1315. The Roman Cardinals gave h im the crown. Frederick, Duke of Austria, opposed them, bu t he was defeated. Then Charles IV, King of Bohemia , was Emperor for 31 years. He raised the Bishopric of Pr ague to an Archbishopric. There were great earthqua kes. In 1453, Constantinople was taken by the Turks on a ccount of the treachery of a certain Janvens. Soon the whole of Greece abandoned Christianity. For, in a short time , several Christian principalities and kingdoms wer e taken and ravaged by the Turks. In these days, many serious w ars broke out among the Christiansin Gaul, in Engla nd, in Saxony, in Westphalia, in Prussia, in Flanders, in Sweden, as well as in other countries. At this time , too, the art of printing, which was an admirable discovery, a divin e gift, occurred at Mainz, the capital of Germany. In the year 1456 of the Christian Era, the Turks, massacred in Hungary by the faithful, perished in great numbers. An admirable pilgrimage of children came to Saint Michel. There were earthquakes in the Kingdom of Naples which cau sed more than 40,000 people to perish.... In the year 1486 of the Christian Era, Maximilian, son of Frederick, was consecrated King of the Roman s in Frankfurt and hailed as Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Julius II in 1508. He founded the military order of St. George against the heretics and the Turks. He vanquished t he Swiss, reduced the Sicambrians, and triumphed ov er all rebels. The King of France, pursuing the imperial Crown acc ording to his custom, hatched plots against the Emp ire; but the All-Powerful maintained what had been organized by Samael In 1508, the Venetians, revolting against th e authority of the Emperor, were punished by banishment and dea th. Stubbornness will be punished, wise submission rewarded. Toward the end of this third period of Samael, an i mportant change, returning things to their original , first state, will lead to the destruction of many worlds. In fact, if by the will of God, the \"gamma point\" is brought t o face the North, a great change will occur in some monarchy or great kingdom. A great religious sect will rise up to re place the ancient cults. It is to be feared that the fourth beast of the Apo calypse could lose a head. During the first period of Samael, Mars announced the flood; during the second, the fall of Troy; toward the end of the third, there will be a break in unity."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Indeed, based upon the precedents, one might infer the following: This third period of Mars will not c onclude without this prophecy being furfilled and a new rel igion being instituted. Now, only 17 years remain b etween the present year of the Christian Era (1508) and the en d of Samael's reign in 1525. Omens of ill fortune w ill be seen. For, before the year 1525 of the Christian Era, the crosses seen these last 10 years on people's cloth es will have their consequences.... For the twentieth period, Gabriel, Angel of the Moo n, will take up the direction of the world again on June 4 of the year of creation 6732, which is the year 15252 of t he Christian Era. Gabriel will govern the world for 354 years and 4 months until the year of the world 7086, the eigh th month, or the year of the Lord 1879.

According to the researches of Christopher Bamford, the first English translation of the littl e book was by the English magician, William Lilly. Later it surfaces in the occult writings of the Frenchman, Eliphas Le vi (1855) and passed on by him to Anna B. Kingsford and Edward Maitland, two more English, but Christian oc cultists. From Maitland, the book passed on the W. Wynn Wescott, all of whom were members of the T.S. and c lose friends of the good Madame H.P.B. Indeed, ther e is a small footnote to Trithemius in volume I of the SEC RET DOCTRINE, although not another word of it is me ntioned. Wescott published it in 1896, presumably as a magic ritual for the members of the Golden Dawn. The Mystical Chronology is a wonderful little book full of esoteric Christian gems of wisdom. It begin s, \"Most wise Emperor, this lower world, created and o rganized by the First Intelligence, who is god, is ruled by Secondary Intelligences. Hermes, who gave us the sc ience of the Magi (our ancient Chaldean/Sumerian st ar gazers), confirms this when he says that seven spirits were assigned to the seven planets from the beginning of the heavens and of the earth. \"Each of these Spirits rules the universe in turn f or a period of 354 years and 4 months...The first a ngel or spirit, that of Saturn, is called Oriphiel. God confided the gov ernment of the world to him starting with the begin ning of creation.\" The chronological order is difficult to cipher, sin ce he begins in the first year of the world (book o f Genesis), and counts forward in time, so that the first cycle sev en rounds is completed on June 26, 2480 and the sec ond cycle of seven rounds is completed on September 1, 4960. Tra nsposing these cycles to our Julian calender, we ha ve the third cycle of: Oriphiel, from ----------245BC to 109BC; Anael, from -------------109BC to 463 AD; Zachariel, from ---------463 to 817; Raphael, from ----------817 to 1171; Samael, from -----------1171 to 1525; Gabriel, from -----------1525 to 1879; and Michael, the sun spirit beginning 1879. This is obviously a septenary of Archangelic rule o f 354.3 years each, but the cycles do not divide by seven evenly into an astrological age of 2160 years (308.57 year s).

Accu rate because Dr. Steiner had spoken hundreds of times about the \"Battle in Heaven\" in the years between 1841 and 18 79, wherein the Spirits of Darkness belonging to Ahriman fought the good spirits of Archangel Michael (pronounced, Mic-ha- el), prior to his regency beginning year 1879. Reli ed upon, because Dr. Steiner devoted and dedicated his whole life's work to the regency of Michael. DIFFERENCES between the Two Zodiacs Although each zodiac is important for its intended purpose, there are very important differences betwe en them. Traditional symbolism relating to the zodiacal arch etypes is often confusing and misleading because, h istorically, no"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"distinction is made between them for mere lack of s pecificity not to mention the deliberate Blinds tha t used to fascinate the good Madame H.P.B. and other occultis ts. We will endeavor to specifically assign to each zodiac its corresponding symbolism as appropriate. First, the tropical zodiac is a zodiac of increasin g and decreasing light which works upon the plant k ingdom as light as warmth. The starting point for this yearly cycle begins on March 21st at the spring equinox at whic h time the hours of daylight begin to last longer than the hou rs of darkness. This zero base line is shown in the attached plat. The first 3 steps of the sun in declination beginni ng the vernal equinox is a cycle of increasing ligh t until the maximum is reached at summer solstice. The next 3 s teps of the sun, from the summer solstice to the fa ll equinox, is a cycle of decreasing light, but the light still pr edominates over the darkness. Beginning the fall eq uinox, the scales are tipped in favor of the cycle of darkness. The n ext 3 steps of the sun, from the fall equinox to th e winter solstice, is a cycle of increasing darkness. At the winter so lstice, there is a minimum of sunlight and a maximu m of darkness. The next 3 steps of the sun, from the winter solsti ce to the vernal equinox, is a cycle of decreasing darkness, but darkness predominates over sunlight. Thus, the annual cycle of light/darkness correspond s exactly to the motion of the sun thru the tropica l zodiac in declination. For this reason, we have the annual cy cles of growth-in spring; expansion-in summer; deca y-in-fall and contraction-in winter. In fact, this yearly cycle i s like one large breath in the life of the earth, o ne of inhalation and exhalation. All ancient cultures began their New Year in exact correspondence with this date of the beginning of s pring. For our Sumerian/Chaldean/Babylonian star gazers, the first lunar month began on the new moon falling after th e vernal equinox. This great festival celebration, which has been carried over on a different date to our Chris tian Easter, was called the NEOMENIA, commencing the 1st day of Arie s. With the fixing of the first day of spring on Ma rch 2lst- the 1st of Aries by the acceptance of the Julian ca lendar, we have forgotten that the actual Neomenia varies over a cycle of nineteen years. However, with the celebrat ion of Easter as a movable feast, we are reminded s omewhat that the first day of spring is a cosmic event, not dete rmined my man, but by the cycle of the earth's annu al breath. Because of the importance of the Neomenia in determ ining the first day of spring, all ancients used a lunar calendar recognizing the correspondence between the moon pha ses and plant growth. A typical lunar calendar cons isted of 354 (1/3) days composed of 12 lunar (synodic) month s each 29 1/2 days long. Long before the Julian cal endar was adopted in 45 BC, the priests of each culture did k now the length of the solar astronomical year at 36 5 days, a difference of about eleven days from the lunar year . Because the lunar year elapsed eleven days before the solar year, an intercalation was inserted to balance out the year. Usually this was accomplished by the inse rtion of a thirteenth month every three years. The exact metho d known to our Chaldean/Babylonian Magi was based u pon the 19 year cycle historically attributed to Meton in 4 33 BC. Lunar phases recur on the same day of the month ove r a cycle of nearly 19 years, now called the Metoni c cycle. There are 235 synodic (29.5 days) months in every 1 9 Julian calendar years. Beginning about the 6th ce ntury BC, the Chaldeans inserted this extra lunar month in an intercalary year as a second month of Virgo before the fall equinox or as a second month of Pisces prior to the vernal equinox. Prior to the adoption of the Julian calendar, it is believed that the Essenes at Qumran were the only ancient cult to actually use a solar astronomical calendar year con sisting of 12 months of 52 weeks of 7 days each. Th ese 364 days were divided into four quarters of 91 days each, li ke the 4 X 91 steps on the Mayan Chichen Itza pyram id. Although each lunar season consisted of three months of thir ty days each, the extra 31st day was added four tim es per year at the end of the month of each quarter. Obviously, in the Jewish tradition when the Essenes were using a solar calendar different from the Pharisees, problems ove r the dates of certain festivals could occur. In fact, when Jesus was brought before Caiaphas to answer to sedition charges, one serious charge was that Jesus ate the Pascal lamb on the day before Passover. Sister Emmerich relates that as a response to the charge, \"Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea proved from written documen ts that the Galileans, according to our ancient cus tom, were permitted to eat Pasch one day earlier than the oth er Jews.\" She also stated that \"The Galileans did n ot always make use of their privilege.\" That Nicodemus used writte n documents implies to me that these documents may have been the solar calendar tables of the Essenes, which mig ht vary the celebration dates of traditional festiv als in certain years when the Pharisees used intercalation days to balance their lunar year. In conclusion, the differences (chart) between the tropical and sidereal zodiacs are significant. Wher eas the tropical zodiac has 12 steps of the sun, the sidereal zodiac has 36 steps over the course of 25,920 years. The motion of the sun thru the tropical zodiac is counter-clockwise i n celestial latitude. The motion of the sun thru th e sidereal zodiac is clock-wise in celestial longitude. In addition, there is the difference of eleven days between the solar and lunar calendar years. In the human time of the tropical zodiac, one year equals 365 1/4 days, whereas, in the cosmic time of the sidereal zodiac, one day of"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"earth time is 1 degree of precession over 72 human years. One human day equals 25, 920 individual huma n breaths, whereas, one breath of the earth, as the cycle of l ight/darkness equals one human year. These are the differences we will try to explore in the traditional symbolism of the zodiac, by specifically assigning to the appro priate zodiac its intended ciphers. SYMBOLS OF THE TROPICAL ZODIAC The Amahraspands The holy book of the Zoroastrians is the AVESTA, wh ich like the Hindu VEDAS, codifies the much earlier oral teachings that existed for thousands of years befor e the book. The Persian cultural epoch lasted from 5076 BC to 2907 BC and Zarathustra was the prophet appointed b y the solar deity. The general schema of Mazdean co smology reflects the tropical zodiac structure of the phase s of the declination of light. The Persian wisdom w as very simplistic and separated the universe into two halv es, one of light, represented in the tropical zodia c as the passage from the vernal equinox thru the summer solstice to the autumnal equinox, and one of darkness, represe nted in the tropical zodiac as the passage from the autumnal eq uinox thru the winter solstice to the vernal equino x. The Avestan Ahura Mazda, later in the 9th century t exts, Ohrmazd, was the appointed \"Lord of Wisdom\" a nd he ruled the height of the heavens of light. His appoi nted antagonist was the Avestan, Angra Mainyu, late r called Ahriman. Ahriman ruled the depth of the abyss of da rkness and was the counter-power of the power of li ght. He was responsible for evil, disease, disintegration and d eath. It is for this reason that Dr. Steiner calls Ahura Mazda the second revelation of the Christ, the first revelati on of the 7 Rishis being the Hindu Vishnu and the t hird revelation of the Egyptians being called Osiris. Karman Ahriman, he calls the spirit of the earth whose elementary s pirits are the forces of the laws of nature. Between these two eternal powers of light and darkn ess, good and evil, was the earth as battleground, together with all creation. Evil was a substance created by god, but placed into the creation to separate matter, so that it may run its course of the seven-fold cycles of infinite div ersity of manifestation. At the end of the cycle of manifestation, the aeon will come to restore the mix and cast Ahriman and his demons back into the abyss. this is the sou rce of the theological dualism long attributed to Mazdaism and later to Manicheism by our professors of dogma, wh o reduce this revelation to childish and rudimentary cosmolo gy. Surrounding the Lord of Wisdom and Light were six e manations called AMAHRASPANDS, the Avestan Amerta Spenta, belonging to the hierarchy of archangels. T ogether with Ohrmazd, these six archangels form a D ivine Heptad, of which three were masculine on his right side and three were feminine, on his left side. To the masculine side were assigned the tasks: VOHO MANAH, the prote ction of the entire animal creation; ARTA VAHISHTA, the element of fire in all its manisfestations; and to XSHATHRA VAIRYA, the delegation of the metals. To the feminine side were assigned the tasks: SPENT A ARMAITI, the divine wisdom (our Sophia); HAARVATAT, the element of water and its kingdom of creations; and to AMERTAT, the entire plant and vegetable kingdoms. These were so many emanations f rom the good principle as blessings bestowed upon m ankind in which to cooperate for the element or kingdom as signed. Ahriman, in his turn, also emanated six DEVS, as et ernal opponents of the six good emanations. Again, this shows the Mazdean concept of evil as a roadblock across t he path of normal evolution, a celestial plan of op position, so as to manifest the infinite possibilities of existence on our physical plane. Helping assist the Divine P lan of the Powers of Light, are so many YAZATAS, or Izads in Persian, which belong to the hierarchy of angels, whose leg ion is infinite. Finally, there is the legion of FRAVARTIS , called \"those who have chosen\", who were feminine angels who also assist the Divine Plan but are also heaven ly archetypes of all the ranks of angels, including Ohrmazd himself. The ancient wisdom of the tropical zodiac symbolize d the six Amahraspands under the banners of light a nd the six Devs under the banners of darkness. This, of course , corresponds to the six months of positive declina tion and six months of negative declination. In Mazdean chronolo gy, cyclical time was measured by the passage of th e sun thru the tropical zodiac in a great year of 12,000 human years and of 12 parts, one for each zodical house. During the great cycle, the tropical zodiac was divided betwee n the two powers, for 3 thousand years, good triump hed, then for 3 thousand years, evil held sway. Then for the rema ining 6 thousand years, they mutually destroy each other's labors. At the end of the 12 millennia, a virgin en ters the waters of lake Kansaoya, where she is mira culously impregnated and gives virgin birth to the Aeon sent to redeem mankind. Sound familiar ? The Essene Belial The saga of the Lords of Light doing battle against the Lords of Darkness does not end with the fall o f the Persian cultural epoch.

In II Corinthia ns 6:15 Paul asks, \"What concord hath Christ with B elial?\", clearly equating Belial with Satan, the leader of a ll demons. The Essenes called themselves the \"Sons of Light\" w ho opposed the \"Sons of Darkness.\" In the WAR SCROL L they describe another cosmic battle between good an d evil. In it they also resurrect the 4 cycles of 3 thousand years war described in the Avesta. \" The Sons of Light and the lot of Darkness (the ar my of Belial) shall battle together for God's might . In the war, the Sons of Light shall be the strongest during three l ots, in order to strike down wickedness, and in thr ee lots, the army of Belial will gird themselves in order to force th e lot (of the sons of Levi, Judah and Benjamin) to retreat.\" The Sons of Light do eternal battle against the for ces of Belial, which include both traditional Hebre w enemies called the Kittim, probably the Roman empire, and t heir own brethern, who belong to the \"congregation of Belial.\" Sister Emmerich clearly identified this congregatio n as the Pharisees, the Sadduces and the Herodians, all of whom were enemies of the new covenant of the coming Chri st. They were led by the \"wicked priest\" who was pr obably that series of Hasmonean priests from Judas Maccaba eus to Alexander Jannaeus, during which time the Te acher of Righteousness was crucified. The Essenes placed themselves in the very center of this cosmic battle between good and evil. They wro te of Belial, \" Accursed be all the spirits of his lot, in his wicked plan, for they are the lot of Darkness, and the lot of God is for everlasting Light. You created Belial for the pit, angel of enmity, his domain is in darkness, his counsel is for evil and wickedness. All the spirits of his lot, angels of destruction, walk in the laws of darkness.\" The Essenes call on Michael, the archangel of Israe l, as Prince of Light to \"exault the authority of M ichael over all other gods.\" He does battle against the Prince of D arkness, \" To assist truth, and destroy wickedness, to demolish darkness, to exterminate all the sons of darkness, and increase light.\" The Sons of Light are, of course, the normal angels , angels of light led by the archangel Michael. His battle with the sons of Darkness we now know from Dr. Steiner as th e legions of earthly elementary spirits led by Ahri man. The archetypal symbol of this struggle is Michael v. th e Dragon or in more modern times with St. George as Michael. This battle is not unique to the Essenes, for as sa id in the Avesta, the battle lasts for eternity, to the end of cyclical time. Dr. Steiner has made us familiar with the most rece nt scene of the battle between Michael and Ahriman, that which occurred between the years 1841 and 1879. Like all such battles, it occurred first in the spiritual wo rlds. There, the vanquished are banished from heaven and cast to Ear th. \" Losing the battle means they are no longer in the heavens, instead they are to be found in the human realms.\" In this last battle, the normal archangels were pre paring the angels to replace them as agents working in the human blood, so they could move on and become active in t he human nervous system. However, certain retarded angels made the attempt to replace the evolving archangels in the nervous system, instead of their designated place in the blood. As the victor in this spiritual battle, Mich ael cast the \"angels of darkness\" out of the nervou s system and back into the blood, where they belong. What they do in our blood is another story. The point here is that \" every battle between Micha el and the dragon is similar to the one in 1840, bu t it is about different things. A crowd of Ahrimanic spirits seek s over and over again to bring something into world evolution, but they are always overcome.\" The first battle bet ween Michael and the dragon was the so-called \"War in Heaven.\" Here, in the planetary evolution between Jupiter an d Mars, certain Spirits of Motion, belonging to the middle level of the Second Hierarchy, separated off and became \" Gods of Hindrance\" whose task was to oppose the Div ine Plan of cosmic evolution. These spirits were in fact adv ersely commanded\" by the higher hierarchies to caus e opposition. Herein were laid the seeds of evil, for in evolutio n, everything repeats itself (at a higher level) an d during later planetary recapitulations, what was once adverse or ders, became in the future, acts of spiritual free- will. Thus,"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"during the Old Moon manvantara, when the earth and moon spheres separated, certain spiritual beings ad vanced and others remained behind, causing evil deeds again. D uring the Lemurian Age of our present Earth manvant ara, when the moon again separated out from the earth, certai n beings advanced and others remained behind, causi ng Luciferic angels to be cast down to earth and invade the huma n astral bodies. Thus, during the normal course of planetary evoluti on, the first War in Heaven was repeated two more t imes during the subsequent stages of recapitulation. Although t he beings who remained behind are characterized on the planetary scale as Luciferic spirits, when the same process i s repeated during earth evolution, the same paralle l separation occurs on the human scale in the microcosm with res pect to the earth spirits of Ahriman/Belial. As a result of the War in Heaven and its two subseq uent planetary recapitulations, three hierarchies o f evil are created, one on the level of angels, one at the lev el of archangels and one at the Archai level. Durin g the middle of the Lemurian Age, Lucifer and his legion intervened in human evolution to invade the astral body and d uring the middle of the Atlantean Age, Ahriman and his legion intervened to invade the etheric body. In our present Fifth Aryan Age, mankind will be vis ited by a new, much more powerful source of evil co ming from the hierarchy of Archai/Spirits of the Age. These r etarded Archai separated off the normal path of evo lution of the good Archai during the Old Saturn manvanta, before the separation of the sun. Ahriman separated off du ring the second stage of recapitulation, when the earth-moon planet separated from the sun. Lucifer descended d uring the third recapitulation when the moon separated off fr om the earth. The hierarchy of the Archai was origi nally designated by the Hindu tradition at the rank of \"S uras\", which represented the ENTIRE hierarchy of Ar chai. Later, during the second cultural epoch, the Magi recogniz ed the division within the hierarchy between good a nd evil, between normal and retarded Archai and renamed the hierarchy \"A-Suras.\" The negative connotation of wh ich would only apply to the evil suras. Because our Wes tern tradition of angelology derives from the Magi/Chaldean/Hebrew/Essene sources, the Hindu name has come to represent the entire hierarchy. ADZURA is the name given to the leader of the Asura s within the hierarchy of Archai. He and his legion of angels will attack the human physical body in opposition t o the 7th principle of Atma. In our chart of planet ary forces relating to the seven principles (infra), Saturn co ntrols Atma and its opposition is in the moon. In t he sense that Manas is a conscious transformation by the ego of t he astral body, Buddhi is a conscious transformatio n by the ego of the etheric body, Atma is also a conscious trans formation by the ego of the physical body. For most people, this transformation occurs unconsciously, during sleep a nd after death, by the efforts of the normal Archai . However, beginning in our cultural epoch and extending into the future epochs, Adzura will attack the conscious transformation by the ego of the physical body caus ing decay and disintegration. As with Ahriman, his corruptness lies in leading mankind on the path of materialism, to blind man to the source of life within the spir itual worlds. Dr. Steiner says that, \" In the course of the earth period, man will cast away all the evil brought to him by the Luciferic s pirits together with the blessing of freedom. The evil wrought by t he Ahrimanic spirits can be shed in the course of k arma. But the evil wrought by the Asuric powers cannot be expunge d in this way. These Asuric powers will seize hold of the consciousness soul together with the 'I', to unite with earthly materiality. Fragment after fragment w ill be torn out of the 'I'and in the same measure that in which the As uras establish themselves in the consciousness soul , man must leave parts of his existance behind on the earth. W hat thus becomes the prey of the Asuric powers will be irretrievably lost.\" This leads us to the reason for the Avestan and Ess ene abyss. The Eight Sphere We have seen that the intentional cosmic deed of th e War in Heaven led to the three hierarchies of evi l. The Asuric, led by Adzura, resulted from the recapitulation of the Old Saturn manvantara; the Ahrimanic, led by Ah riman, resulted from the recapitulation of the Old Sun man vantara and the Luciferic, led by Lucifer, resulted from the recapitulation of the Old Moon manvantara. As a res ult, the evolution of the spiritual gifts (the thre e higher principles) given to mankind by the hierarchies are constantly under attack by these legions of evil, which we have now come to call the Spirits of Darkness. Lucifer w orks thru the hierarchy of angels within the astral body; Ahriman works thru the hierarchy of archangels within the e theric body and Azdura works thru the hierarchy of Archai within the physical body. The elemental spirits of Lucifer work thru the elements of air and water. The eleme ntal spirits of Ahriman and Adzura work thru the elements of earth and fire and working with fire is much more powerfu l than the other elements, as the ancient Atlanteans hopefully learned. The three hierarchies of archai-archangels-angels a re reflected in the spheres of Father-Son-Holy Spir it in the regions of physical-etheric-astral bodies in man. L ucifer in his battle in the sphere of the Holy Spir it was redeemed by the act of the Christ in His decent into hell af ter the crucifixion. Ahriman in his battle in the s phere of the Son, will be redeemed in the future by the act of the Ch rist becoming the Lord of Karma. However, what is l ost in the sphere of the Father, is forever lost to human evol ution and the symbol of this is the abyss of the Ei ght sphere."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The occult concept of the Eight sphere was first ma de exoteric by A.P.Sinnett in his landmark book ESO TERIC BUDDHISM. Here he absolutely identified the Eight s phere with the materiality of the moon. Some of the errors he made were later corrected by the Good Madame Blavat sky in her SECRET DOCTRINE, where she hoped that future editions of Sinnett's book would finally cor rect the mistakes. However, this was never done and the errors still persisted leading to the conclusion that the Eight sphere was the moon, the former sphere of Lucifer d uring the Old Moon manvantara. Later, when Dr. Steiner identified the nine interio r levels of the earth with source levels of evil, t he Eighth sphere became identified with the earth, the sphere of Ahr iman. In addition, Steiner said that man could not penetrate with his consciousness the earth's interior thereby sett ing up an absolute barrier for knowledge of the Eig hth sphere. Dr. Steiner in his book THE OCCULT MOVEMENT IN THE 19TH CENTURY (1915) tried to reconcile the two views. As we know, seven of the 12 conditions of conscious ness are available to mankind thru the evolution of the seven manvantaras from Old Saturn to Vulcan. We are prese ntly in the fourth, the Earth manvantara. These sev en spheres represent successive stages of evolution and they o ccur within each other, as transformations of the p lanet earth. Since the beginning of this Fourth round, Lucifer a nd Ahriman have had a plan to create or mineralize their own sphere, which at the end of plantetary evolution, w ould detach itself from the earth and go its own wa y into the cosmos. This sphere has come to be called in occult ism, the Eighth sphere. In order to accomplish this task, it is necessary f or a process of mineralization to occur. What are \" imaginations\" or thought forms in an earlier sphere, become material ized in the next sphere. Thus, the imaginations of humanity that occur during this Round, will descend from the astr al world during the next Jupiter sphere and become physical. This is especially true for the great works of art and music we produce now. During the transition from the Old Moon manvantara to the Earth manvantara, what was formerly only imaginatively perceptible, becomes materially perce ptible. This occurs by adding matter to the spirit by the process of mineralization. All the imaginations present in the Old Moon manvantara, should have passed over in to Earth evolution to become mineralized. However, Lucifer a nd Ahriman stole certain imaginations belonging to the Old Moon evolution and when these are added to the sphe re of Earth evolution, an Eighth sphere is created that works in opposition to the Divine Plan of the Elohim. The Ea rth sphere arrives out of the Old Moon sphere by vi rtue of the activities of the Spirits of Motion being added to the activities of the Spirits of Form. During the F ourth globe of this Fourth round, the mineral kingdom is added to the p lant and animal kingdoms that previously evolved on the Old Moon. When the activities of Lucifer and Ahriman ar e also added to the normal activities of the Spirit s of Motion and of Form, the Eighth sphere becomes mineralized, presently with astral substance, which in the futu re, will become physical substance. Now, when these stolen imaginations become minerali zed during our Earth evolution, they take with them certain physical atoms that rightfully belong to our Earth evolution. What is taken away is directed by Lucife r and Ahriman into the Eighth sphere in the hope of creating thei r own planet. This was the planet promised to Lucif er after the War in Heaven but, as you can see from the asteroid bel t between Mars and Jupiter, this planet was destroy ed and only remnants remain, still in orbit. Thus, do the Spiri ts of Form, \"Battle for every morsel of substantial ity capable of mineralization lest it should be wrested away from them by Lucifer and Ahriman and borne into the Eigh th sphere.\" As a counter-weight to the astral materiality of th e Eighth sphere, the Spirits of Form mineralized th e moon, with a much greater density than that of the earth. Therea fter, when the moon separated from the earth, JHVH- Elohim went with the moon to command the forces of the Elohim f rom there. Thus, the imaginations created during th e Old Moon manvantara that were stolen by Lucifer and Ahr iman which by now had mineralized into physical ato ms, went out of the earth to remain in the physical moo n. The mineral content of the present moon also con tains the spiritual content of the Old Moon forces. As such, the major source of mineral atoms from which Old Mo on imaginations could be mineralized, was removed from the earth and put back under the domain of the Spi rits of Form as a physical counter-weight. However, what ma teriality that still remains within the earth spher e is subject to the war between the Lords of Light and the Spirits of Darkness, only the largest source has been remov ed. We seen then the error of Sinnett was to mistake th e astral corporality of the real Eighth sphere with the physical materiality of the moon. The moon in effect acts as a counter-weight, with its center of gravity locat ed in the center of the moon, which is under the influence of JHVH. Like the polar field of forces of a magnet, the moo n, as one pole, draws against the center of gravity within th e center of the earth, as the other pole, which is under the influence of Ahriman. In the middle is the astral sphere of t he Eighth sphere with Lucifer in his domain as lead er of the Old Moon forces. The astral substance of the Old Moon forces (imagin ations) is the actual Eighth sphere. As the astral becomes etheric and as the etheric hardens into physical ma tter, so too the combined activities of the Spirits of Motion, the Spirits of Form and Lucifer/Ahriman would have pass ed over to the Jupiter manvantara only a shell of t he earth,"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"while at the same time creating a physical planet t o further the evolution of the Spirits of Darkness. Whether or not this will actually happen is a matter of future evo lution. Since our earth is the planet destined to b ecome a future sun in a far distant manvantara, with Christ as our lea der, we do not want any competition from the Spirit s of Darkness. What they really need is to capture a human soul to take with them. This has been symbolised in the pa st literature by the \"pact with the Devil\" such as seen in the 16 th century HISTORIA VON D. JOHANN FAUSTEN, Christopher Marlowe's play and Goethe's FAUST. To d ate, no human soul has yet been lost to the Eighth sphere, including those of Nero, Ghengis Khan, Shaka Zulu a nd Hitler. However, can this happen in the future s ixth and seventh cultural epochs ? The Abyss When St John received his revelation within the thu nder and lightning at the Isle of Patmas, he had th e historical eschatology of the Avestan, with the battle of the Amahraspands and the Devs and the Dead Sea Scrolls, with the Sons of Light and Sons of Darkness, to draw upon. B oth sources had seen fit to describe the battle as one between the light and dark phases symbolized in the tropica l zodiac. But what of the symbolism of the Abyss? W e can see now that it is that indescribable place of the Eigh th sphere. From the darkness of pralaya ending the Old Moon ma nvantara, emerged the first Earth Globe, then in a dissolved condition of Arupa. During the Earth manvantara, th e earth evolves thru 7 Conditions of Form, called G lobes in Theosophy. They are as follows: 1. Higher Devachan 7. Archetypal (higher Devachan) 2. Lower Devachan 6. (Lower- Devachan) Intellectual. 3. Astral 5. (Plastic) Astral 4. Physical The first Arupa Globe contains in dissolved form al l the evolutionary forms reduced to seeds and imagi nations passed over to earth evolution from the Old Moon ma nvantara, except for those stolen by Lucifer/Ahrima n. These imaginations were present in a formless state as pu re thoughts of the Spirits of Form, whose task it w as to develop this earth and instill into mankind their Fourth Pr inciple-the human (group) ego. When the Arupa spher e condensed, the Rupa sphere emerged with more densified thought -forms, which contained the thought forms of the hu man, animal and plant kingdoms. When the Rupa sphere den sified, the Spirits of form poured out its astral m atter filling these thought forms with shape, light and color. Th en, during our fourth globe, the mineral kingdom de scended bringing about our 7 evolutionary Ages, from the Po larian thru the Seventh root Race which passes thru 7 X 7 = 49 sub-races/cultural epochs. During the Polarian Age, the sun-earth-moon were st ill united in one cosmic globe in the shape of a so rt of figure 8 double donut. Man and the other kingdoms had not ye t descended into physical form. During the Hyperbor ean Age, the earth-moon planet separated off the sun and the Apollo men, sons of the Solar Pitris, descended in to beautiful human forms. During the Lemurian Age, the moon sepa rated off the earth and the Lunar Pitris descended into ugly, primitive human bodies. This Age was the beginning of sexual evolution and during the middle, the Luci feric angels penetrated man's astral body. Those that \"refused t o incarnate\" went into pralaya on the various plane ts waiting for more favorable conditions. During the Atlantean Age , these human souls returned to earth and incarnate d into mankind achieving racial evolution thru 7 x 7 sub-r aces. During our Fifth Aryan Age, the racial charac teristics of mankind recede into the background and heredity evo lves thru 7 cultural epochs. During the future Sixt h Age of the 7 Seals, humanity evolves so that its karma is carr ied on the human countenance. It will no longer mat ter into what racial group one is born, the mark of evil will be carried on the forehead, like the mark of Cain. In a pre-figuration of 6-6-6, mankind will be separated into two classes o f good and evil. During the last seventh Age of the trumpets, the course elements of the earth will manifest as bruta l conditions of nature as described in REV:8. After the trumpet blast of the seventh angel, earth evolution as we k now it (for this manvantara) will cease. Thereafter, begins the ascent of the Fifth, Sixth a nd Seventh Globes into spiritualization in contra-d istinction to the previous descent of the three Globes into matter. T his is recognized in the APOCALYPSE by the descent of Heavenly Jerusalem, the more-perfect astral world o f human imaginations. On the downward curve, the th oughts, thought forms and astral substance was sacrificed a nd given to mankind by JHVH and his legions. During the upward curve, the earth and all of its creations wi ll dissolve into a seed condition into this heavenl y astral globe."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"There will be a repetition of the conditions that p revailed during the Hyperborean and Polarean Ages. All matter will dissolve and during the Seventh Globe, the earth wi ll re-unite with the sun. In this ascending astral globe, a separation must o ccur before the earth passes over into the Jupiter manvantara. Humans will have spiritualized themselves and with the Christ impulse inside, will raise up the finer particles of earthly matter and unite with the sun, with Christ as the leader. Those persons under the influence of the Spirits of Darkness will have not progressed far enough in evo lution so as to be a material and corporal expressi on of the good. They will not have the power to dissolve matt er and can not ascend into this astral Globe. That portion of the earth that has remained course and those humans who have remained behind in their etheric form of the Beast, will be united with the Eighth sphere. As Dr. Steiner sa ys, \" There will come the time when the insoluble p art will be ejected as a separate globe, a new kind od moon.\" I n the transition from the recapitulation of the Hyp er-borean Age to the Polarean Age, when the earth is re-united wi th the sun, all the Old Moon forces must be ejected for a final time for they can not co-exist within the brillianc e of the Sun-Devachan sphere. For this reason, the Eighth sphere exists, like a comet, to take away all the cosmic a strality of the Spirits of Darkness. Thus, the new earth with its carried over seed from that emerges from the pralaya into the Jupiter man vantara, will be accompanied by a satellite (a moon) consisting o f the physical matter of the Eighth sphere. This fi nal Arupa/Archetypal Globe is symbolized in the APOCALY PSE as a \"woman clothed in the sun, the moon under her feet and upon her head, a crown of 12 stars,\" REV:1 2:1. The moon under her feet is, of course, the cos mic astrality of the Old Moon forces mineralized into a satellite moon and represents the victory of the purified hu man astral body, having expunged the Luciferic forces. The Final Solution of the eternal battle between go od and evil is that mankind is separated into two c lasses during the future Sixth root race. The second dragon REV:1 3:1 arises from the sea of human souls that have re mained behind having failed to purify their astral bodies of animal passions and instincts. The Beast with se ven heads and ten horns represents the Atlantean etheric form tha t has still remained behind during the fifth and si xth root races. These people will be separated out from those of th e \"white robes\" who bear the Christ impulse. These dammed human souls will be cast into the \"bottomless pit\" from which will arise the first dragon REV:12:3. Th is dragon is a symbol for those Luciferic/Ahrimanic elemental bein gs that can not be united with the sun in its final astral stage. When the earth unites with the sun, a dragon appear s in Heaven, because he comes from higher worlds th an the sea, whose beings remain in their original condition and are cast back into the lower astral world. Thus, the Final Solution deals with first, human so uls who have remained behind in their evolution, re presented in the APOCALYPSE by the second/dragon Beast with 7 he ads and 10 horns; and second, the elemental beings of Lucifer/Ahriman represented by the ancient symbolis m of the snake/first dragon. Although the symbolism described by St. John is gra phic and unimpeachable, it does give the impression that after the descent of the Heavenly Jerusalem, the final so lution ends all. All those souls that can be saved, are saved and damn the remainder, cast into the abyss. This is tr ue in so far as respects the Fourth Earth manvantar a. However, the earth becomes physical three more times during each of the Jupiter, Venus and Vulcan manvantaras. Thos e Luciferis/Ahrimanic elementals symbolized by the se cond dragon will reappear during the Jupiter manvan tara as corrupt nature spirits. In the sense that the Old M oon was a cosmos of Wisdom and the Earth Globe is a cosmos of Love, those beings that remained behind on Old Moon evolution become destructive forces during the Ear th Globe. Likewise, these beings that remain behind during th e Earth globe will become destructive forces of Lov e working against the Divine Plan during the evolution of the Jupiter Globe. As for the human souls who have ascended so far as to entirely perfect their astral bodies into a crys talized form, like that of Buddha, their angels will be released to work with the Spirits of Light on special missio ns directed by the Hierarchies. These human souls themselves will rise to the rank of angels sacrificing their physical b odies for future mankind evolving on the Jupiter Globe. As for those humans who have not entirely perfected their astral bodies, but have more good than evil, they will incarnate again into more earth lives during the Ju piter and Venus Globes to progress along the path o f salvation. So, most people get many more chances. However, there a re human souls that have used up their complete cyc le of incarnations and for them, there are no more human forms in which to incarnate again. They will also b ecome nature spirits during the Jupiter Globe. Thus, the real Final Solution only occurs at the nu mber of 6-6-6 during the Sixth root race of the Ven us Globe. This is the last moment for salvation. Those who are not saved will be cast into the FINAL abyss and form t he egregore from which a physical body will incarnate bearing t he Anti-Christ, whose number is Sorath, the sun-dem on. This image is preserved in the APOCALYPSE as the Fall of Babylon REV:17,18. For when the final Vulcan Globe arises, the Earth-Sun will be completely purified o f all the cosmic astrality of all forces remaining over from the previous Six manvantaras. Lucifer and Ahriman will have been redeemed. Adzura and Sorath will have bee n defeated and cast into the Eighth sphere, and like a comet, pass out of our solar system forever."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE SOLSTITIAL GATES OF THE WORLD CROSS Our goal is to explain some of the contradictions i nherent in the traditional symbolism of the zodiac, there is no better place to start than with the confusion of to ngues generated by that most contradictory of all t raditional symbologists, Rene Guenon, (hereinafter R.G.). One favorite epistemological approach R.G. utilizes can be called the \"First Confuse, then Explain wit h less than an answer\" doctrine. This leaves the reader with a poo r understanding and a feeling of stupidity, both of which were probably intended by him. For example, in dealing with the traditional symbol ism of the annual solar cycle of the tropical zodia c, R.G. discusses the contradictions between the placement of the gates of entry to the north/south polar axis as they relate to the SOLSTITIAL GATES. In an article by that name, h e criticizes the traditional occult designations kn own to Western occultism since the time of Macrobius and P orphyry, as the Gate of the Sun (God) and the Gate of Man. Traditionally, the Gate of Man was that zodiacal ho use where the soul, before birth and intended for i ncarnation on earth, would descend into the moon sphere waiting f or re-birth. The Gate of the Sun was that zodiacal house wherein the human soul, after death, would ascend into the planetary spheres beyond the moon sphere, for its s ojourn thru the spiritual worlds, to meet God. Other than the 1 9th century occult attempt within Spiritualism to i dentify the loka of deceased human souls as solely residing within t he moon sphere, the Ancient Wisdom taught that the soul after death, traveled first, to the successive spheres of moon-mercury-venus-sun on its outward journey. Dur ing this ascending stage, the soul reflected on and paid pen ance for the sins of the past life. This ascending stage ended with what was called \"cosmic midnight.\" Thereafter, the second half of the souls journey be gan wherein the soul descended thru the same sphere s again on its downward path into incarnation on earth and passing thru the Gate of Man to enter the moon sphere to a wait rebirth with millions of other souls. While during the firs t half of the journey, the soul reflected upon and suffered for the sins of its past life, during the second half the s oul takes in those forces necessary to build up his future astral, etheric and physical bodies. These forces include b oth preparing its future karma and learning the wis dom taught by the spirits residing in the different planetary sph eres. For example, if one's future karma demanded a person to become a physician, he must learn medicine and spen d time within the sphere of Mercury with the archan gel Raphael. In between the ascending and descending transits, i n order to build up its future bodies, the soul mus t also travel into the sphere of the zodiac wherein the creative force s of the human melothesia reside. Thus, after the s oul's stay in heaven/devachan, it travels thru the spheres of Mar s, Jupiter and Saturn to build up the triad of its higher spiritual bodies, Manas, Buddhi and Atma (at the present time , these visits are brief or existent for most perso ns, since these bodies are very undeveloped). Then, the soul must p rocure a guide and make the jump from Saturn into t he sphere of the zodiac. R.G. in his analysis of the Western tradition says that Proclus, Porphyry, Macrobius and Numenius all confuse and contradict the traditional Greek doctrine of Pythag oras. Of modern occultists he says, \"the incomprehe nsion of modern academics create divergences and contradicti ons, which are really not there at all.\" The problems that are \"really not there at all\", of course, disappear when one considers the Hindu doc trine of Diva/Pitri Yana. In explaining his own traditional forms, R.G. First confuses, then gives a less than satisfactory answer. Consider first the analogy: \"The gate of Men and the Gate of the gods, inevitab ly must correspond to the two solstices. We must no w state more explicitly that the first corresponds to the summer solstice, or to the sign of Cancer and the second to the winter solstice, or the sign of Capricorn. In order to und erstand the reason for this, it is necessary to ref er to the division of the annual cycle into two halves, the one ascending and the other descending. The first is the period of the movement of the sun towards to the north, going fro m winter to summer solstice,; the second is that of the movement of the sun towards the south, going from t he summer to the winter solstice. In the Hindu trad ition, the ascendant phase relates to the deva-yana and the de scendant phase to the pitri-yana which coincides ex actly with the designations of the two gateways we have just menti oned.\" Then, the consider the confusion when R.G. says exa ctly the opposite: \"The solstitial gate of winter, or the sign of Capr icorn, corresponds to the North in the annual cycle , but to the south as regards the path of the sun in the heavens; simi larly, the summer solstitial gate, or the sign of C ancer, corresponds to the South in the annual cycle and to the North a s regards the path of the sun. This is why, while t he ascendant movement of the sun goes from south to North, and i ts descendant movement from North to South, the asc endant period of the year must be regarded, on the contray as being accomplished in moving from North to sout h and its descendant period in moving from South to North.\" In addition, her further confuses the matter by say ing:"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"\"After being manifested here in a certain state, th is (human) being will go out from it by one of the two gates according to the spiritual degree which it has reac hed. In one case, that of pitri-yana, it will have to return to another state of manifestation which naturally will be repr esented by a re-entry into the cosmic cave. In the other case, on the contrary, that of the deva-yana, there is no fu rther return to the manifested world. One of these two gates is thus both an entry and an exit, while the other is a fin al exit.\" Thus, the gate of pitri-yana is a gate for a series of individual incarnations and the gate of deva-ya na serves as the gate at the end of the cycle of incarnations, a fin al exit. After a criticism of the traditional Western occult forms, he explains the superiority of the Hindu sy stem, but with a less than satisfactory answer: \"The solution of this difficulty lies in the distin ction that can be made between the 'celestial' orde r to which the progress of the sun belongs, and the terrestrial' o rder to which belongs the succession of the seasons .\" But in this answer does lie the wisdom of the solut ion. For in the \"celestial\" order (the path of the sun in the heavens) we have the sun's movement in the sidereal zodiac and in the terrestrial\" order (the path of the sun in the annual cycle), we have the sun's motion in the trop ical zodiac. Using the distinctions established in our (above) discussion of the differences between the two zodia cs, we should be able to make sense out of this int entional confusion. First, in relation to the tropical zodiac, we can e stablish a North/South polar axis as the winter/sum mer solstitial axis and an East/West horizontal axis as the vernal/autu mnal equinoctial axis. Together they form a relativ ely vertical axis in the shape of the cross. At the winter solst ice is the house of Capricorn and at the summer sol stice is the house of Cancer. Thus, the ascendant cycle, going from so uth to north, corresponds to our \" Breath of the Ea rth \" as inhalation. "},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" The descendant cycle, going from north to south, c orresponds to our breath of the earth, as exhalatio n. The maximum peak of inhalation being the winter solstic e and the maximum peak of exhalation, being the sum mer solstice. Thus, for R.G. and the Vedantic symbolism, the gate way of deva-yana is situated towards the north and the gateway of deva-yana is situated towards the south, In fact , the cross that symbolizes the annual cycle of the tropical zodiac, is not exactly perpendicular as we described above. Its actual shape is what Madame H.P.B. calls the \" decussated cross in space\" which Plato described as \"the secon d god who impressed himself on the universe in the shape of a cross.\" This Platonic symbol of the Second Logos cr ucified as the world soul upon the world cross in s pace is the origin of all symbolism of the cross and the crucif ixtion. R.G. recognizes this fact of the world cross not be ing exactly perpendicular but more in the shape of an elliptical cross, like this, \"X\", when he says: \"It can be said with still greater precision, that the gateway of the gods is at the north and turned towards the east which is always considered as the side of light and life and that the gateway of men is at the south a nd turned towards the west, which is considered as the side o f darkness and death.\""},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Thus, in our Western tradition, the Greeks describe d the \"descent into generation\" into re-birth, by t he tropical gate of Cancer and the \"ascent to god\" of the soul after death, by the tropical gate of Capricorn, in which the soul ascends into the spiritual ether of the planetary spheres. Therefore, the traditional symbolism of the gate of god to the north in Capricorn and the gate of men to the south in Cancer, is nothing more than our annual ascending a nd descending phases of the tropical zodiac. Furthe rmore, it is within this zodiac that occurs the souls cycles of regular incarnations, prior to the \"final exit.\" Ho pefully, we now have a simple explanation based upon our (above) di stinctions between the two zodiacs. But what is the significance of the reversed polari ty described by Porpyry when, first, the gate of Ca ncer is in the north and the gate of Capricorn is in the South? An d second, what is the significance of the final exi t thru the gate of deva-yana when there is no further return to the ma nifest world? To answer these two questions do we really need R.G .'s explanation that, \"According to the general law of analogy, these two orders must be, in their very correlation , the inverse of one another, in such a way that wh at is highest in the one becomes in the lowest in the other, accordi ng to the Hermetic dictum of the EMERALD TABLE.\" I hope not!!! The answer to the first question is also very simpl e, for what is the reverse of the tropical zodiac ? The sidereal zodiac, of course. Transposing our elliptical cross of the tropical zodiac over to the axial plane of the sidereal zodiac, gives us the symbolism of Porpyry with the reversed polarity of ascending and descending forces. Now w e can say that the ascending forces of the sidereal sun \"in t he heavens\" goes from north to south and the descen ding forces of the sidereal sun goes from south to north. Then our two gates are reversed in direction to accomadate the clock-wise direction of the sidereal sun in celestial longitud e as opposite to the counter-clockwise direction of the tropical sun in its annual course in celestial latitude. It shou ld be kept in mind that when we speak of the revers ed polarity of the gates in the sidereal zodiac, we no longer are talk ing about the gate of pitri-yana and the regular cy cle of incarnations, but of the other gate, that of the fi nal exit. What is the meaning of the \"final exit\" at the gate of deva-yana, when there is no further return to t he manifest world? We saw that the tropical zodiac was a symbol for the cycle of individual incarnations of the so ul which necessarily must enter and exit many times over the course of the reincarnating ego. However, there co mes an end to this cycle, which for Buddha, was his entrance into Nirvana, after which there is no further return in to manifestation. The cycle of earth lives is over. For other human s ouls who achieve less than perfection, one can eith er use up its allotment and wait for the next manvantara or fall out of evolution completely. The sidereal zodiac controls the souls celestial pa ths of incarnation. IDEALLY, the souls paths of inc arnation follows the houses of the zodiac in the reversed or der of the sidereal zodiac over the course of cosmi c time in the 25,920 year cycle of the great solar sidereal year. The Divine Plan laid down by the Spirits of Form i ntended each cycle of incarnation to last approximately the 2,16 0 years of the cycle of the Spirits of the Age. Thu s, the soul in passing thru its regular cycle of incarnations with in the tropical zodiac sphere, returns 12 times in cycles based upon the sun's progression thru the vernal equinox from one house to the next. Again, ideally, Dr. Steiner explained that if the s oul spends about one-third of his lifetime in Kama- loka or purgatory, this would amount to about thirty years for the average person. The Divine Plan provided fo r the soul to spend about twelve times as much time in each of th e remaining spheres or about 360 years each. As the soul passes in both directions thru the three spheres of the fi rst, second and third Angelic Hierarchies, this wou ld constitute six cycles in all. Three spheres in the ascending phase (reflecting and repenting for the past sins of kar ma) and three spheres in the descending phase (building up the co smic bodies for the next incarnation). Between the outward journey and the backward journey, the soul would sp end about 2,160 years, plus or minus the 30 years s pent in Kama-loka. However, for modern man, the length of e ach incarnation has been considerably shortened for the following reasons. Of course, it is the history of evil that road bloc ks are laid against the path of the Divine Plan of the Elohim. The first cause of the shortened return was made by the Elohim itself as a response to the invading of the astral body by the Luciferic spirits during the middle of the Lemu rian Age. YHVH, as Elohim, actually caused the \"fal l into generation\" by establishing the physical process of heredity to give incarnating souls many chances th ru repeated earth lives in order to purify the invaded astral b ody. Repeated earth lives in itself was the actual solution created by the Elohim to fulfill the redemption of Lucifer, wh ich redemption began at the crucifixation of Christ . Thus, when the Lemurian androgyne split into two soul mates, e ach male and female, the period in incarnation was halved into a period of 1080 years for each male/female incarnati on. The second act has evolved over time by the influen ces of Ahriman pulling the soul back towards earth for grounding in earthly materiality. This occurs most frequently in the period after the Cosmic Midnight when the length of stay in the third Hierarchy is deliberate ly shortened by the forces of Ahriman. For example, a criminal who"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"has not controlled his animal impulses and lives wi thin the instincts and passions of the (Apocalypse) Beast, will incarnate much sooner than normal. His travel into the Third Hierarchy within the spheres of Mars, Jup iter and Saturn will be outright rejected. This is also true for a person with strong material ist tenancies. The higher triad of spiritual bodies are so undeveloped, that there are no developed correspond ing spiritual organs to take in the impulses availa ble there. In fact, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter se rves as a barrier to prevent souls from going to th ese higher spheres of the third Hierarchy until the souls have evolved sufficiently. Thus, Dr. Steiner says that the normal length of time between incarnations for modern man has bee n reduced to about 700 or 800 years, even shorter f or those persons above described. There are of course, good people who have a shortened cycle, these being pers ons on a special spiritual mission that was not completed. It can now be said that when a person has completed his allotted cycle of incarnations in the sidereal zodiac, the soul passes thru the deva-yana gate and will not return earth life. This is what R.G. called the final exit . It is reflected in the sidereal zodiac when Porpyry describes the gate of Cancer that is in the north and the opposite ga te of Capricorn that is in the south. The confusion caused by the r eversed polarity occurs because the authors fail to distinguish between the two zodiacs. Further, the course of incarnations within the side real zodiac are governed by what Dr. Steiner calls the \"Spirits of the Rotation of Times\" (presumably, the Spirits of Motion ranked in the middle of the second angelic H ierarchy). The original Divine Plan provided for the spirits o f Wisdom to control the incarnation of the \"human i ndividuality\". However, since these spirits are primarily interest ed in Wisdom, as such, they would have pressed toge ther all possible human perfections gained from repeated ear th lives into ONE single incarnation. This, of cour se, would have made man infinitely wise, but only at the expe nse of Love. What a man in his \"personalty\" develop s thru the element of love over time and repeated earth lives, is enduring for his individuality. Therefore, the Divine Plan was changed to allow repeated earth lives of the person alty (ego) to develop the impulse of love, which is the leading characteristic of this Earth manvantara. Steiner sa ys that \"the spirits of Wisdom became Spirits of th e Rotation of Times\" so that \"the successive incarnations of man were regulated in the successive revolutions of tim e which were again regulated through the course of the stars.\" These stars are, of course, the stars of our sidere al zodiac. The human \"personalty\" of successive ear th lives is the incarnating ego within the cycles of pitri-yana. It is the human \"individ-uality\" that is the eternal higher ego radiating forth as the Buddhi principle which exits at the end of the great cycle thru the gate of dev a-yana. In conclusion, we have tried to show that if one pr eserves the distinction between the tropical and si dereal zodiacs, the confused symbolism of the solstitisal gates bec omes clear. It is the tropical zodiac that serves a s the background within the larger solar sidereal cycle for the entr y and exit into the limited cycle of repeated earth lives. Herein, Capricorn serves as the winter gate and Cancer as t he summer gate, both being pitri-yana. It is the si dereal zodiac that serves as the background for the regulation of individual incarnations, according to the cosmic c ycle of the great solar sidereal year, at the end of which, the soul makes its final exit thru the gate of deva-yana, in to higher manifestation. This cycle of incarnations precessin g through out the sidereal zodiac is what is known as the \"12 Initiations into the Zodiac.\" THE BREATH OF THE EARTH CYCLE We made reference in the last section about the asc endant cycle, going from summer solstice to winter solstice, corresponding to our \"breath of the earth\", as inha lation. And the descendant cycle, going from winter solstice to summer solstice, corresponding to our \"breath of th e earth\", as exhalation.(see BREATH OF THE EARTH pl at) Also, when speaking of the differences between the two zodiacs, we said that the annual cycle of the t ropical zodiac was one \"earth breath\", while one degree of the cyc le of the sidereal zodiac was 72 earth breaths. Lik ewise, 360 degrees of the sidereal zodiac is equal to 25,920 e arth breaths. Now, the cycle of light within the tropical zodiac goes from equinox to equinox, while the cycle of th e earth's breath goes from solstice to solstice. As symbols of the w inter and summer solstice, we have Christmas and St . John's day. We have discussed what happens in nature during the equinox cycle, but what happens during the solstit ial cycle ? As a human, we breathe air in and out over a rythym of approximately 25,920 times per day. This way ou r microcosmic daily cycle comes related to our macroc osmic solar sidereal year cycle. But, the earth als o breaths in and out, not with air, but with the forces of eleme ntary nature spirits. At Christmas time, the elementary soul forces of th e earth are totally inhaled or fully in-breathed, j ust as in a man whose breath is fully inhaled. For good reason, the birth of Christ is celebrated at this time of the year, even though it is more likely, He was actually born at midnite around December 6/7. The Ancient Wisdom recognized that at the winter solstice, the entire soul element of the ear th was entirely contained within itself."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Just the opposite occurs at the summer solstice, ce lebrated as the pagan Midsummer and the Christian S t. John's day. At this time, the earth has totally exhaled or full y out-breathed. All the elementary soul forces that were once contained within the earth at winter solstice, are poured forth into cosmic space. Ahriman is that leading spirit of the earth whose b eing and body consists of the combined forces of al l the elementary spirits of nature. He is that true being of nature thru which the angelic hierarchies make use of his spirit to produce the phenomenon of nature. These elementa ry nature spirits are breathed out during the sprin g to cause the \"growth\" cycle of nature within the tropical zodiac . During the fall, these same elementary spirits ca use the \"decay\" cycle in nature. Thus, at the summer solstice, the earth is fully Ahrimanized and at the winter solsti ce, the earth is fully, for lack of a better word, Christianized. Between the twin peaks of the solstices, the Ancien t Wisdom recognized that it was the archangel Micha el who fought the forces of Ahriman, symbolized as the dra gon. For this reason, the festival of St. Michael w as placed near the fall equinox on September 29th. Then, Michael c ould purify the earthly Ahrimanic forces of decay a nd death before the normal inhalation cycle is completed. As Christmas approaches, the forces of the dragon lie beneath His feet and Michael unites with the inhaling breath of the earth, so that the winter festival is as pure as the snow that covers the earth in celebration. These festivals of Christmas, St. John's day and St . Michael's day are all fixed, but in the spring, t he Easter festival is moveable, to accommodate the cosmic date of the Neo menia. Spring, is the release of elementary nature spirits from the breath of the earth and does actually begin on the Neomenia, the first new moon after the vernal e quinox. However, it came to be celebrated as the Christian festival of Easter on the first Sunday after the fi rst full moon after the vernal equinox. Easter is not meant to celebrate the first day of s pring, but the first SUN-Day to celebrate the resur rection of the Sun-Spirit, Christ, in his victory over death. The ascending cycle from winter to summer solstice, is a cycle of exhalation for the earth. The Ancient Wisdom recogn ized that: (1) the out-flowing forces of the sun co ming towards the earth and (2) the out-flowing forces of the ear th, unite at Easter time. Since Easter is a celebra tion of the united sun and earht forces, the Ancient Wisdom did not wa nt any interference coming from the forces of the m oon. For this reason, Easter was set after the first full mo on, so that the out-pouring forces of the earth at Easter would not be reflected back towards the earth by the mirror-like face of the full moon and interfering with the cos mic union of the earth and sun forces. This secret of the Ancient Wisdom was a battlegroun d between Roman and Celtic Catholicism over the fix ing of the date for Easter, particularly in the event that the first Sunday and the first full moon fell on the s ame day. The Celtic practice was to celebrate Easter on the Sunday of a full moon, while the Roman practice was to postpon e Easter until one week later, after the full moon. Although the R oman church fathers made many mistakes in applying the Ancient Wisdom to ecclesiastical events, they were correct on this issue and prevailed at the great co uncil of 664 AD held by King Oswy. The Easter celebration also marked a transition for the Ancient Mystery tradition from lunar conscious ness to solar consciousness. Prior to the mystery of Golgotha, Ea ster, as a celebration of \"Death and Resurrection\", was a mystery directed at the moon influences controlling nature. The revelations of the Sun-Spirit were seldom expe rienced by direct observation of the sun, (eg., the Celtic dol mens) but always experienced indirectly as reflecti ons from the moon. It is in this sense that Dr. Steiner always r eferred to the moon Elohim, YHVH, as the reflected Christ. In the pre-Christian era, the mystery of Death and Resurrection was celebrated during the fall equinox as the Adonis Festivals of Asia Minor. Exoterically, a sculptured image of Adonis was lowered into a lake (as a symb ol for the cosmic ether) and left there for three days while t he citizens prayed and acted remorseful. Afterwards , the icon was drawn out of the lake and the citizens celebrated w ith parties and festivities. Esoterically, the init iate was laid in a coffin for three days, during which time his Hierop hant took him on tour of the spiritual worlds. Firs t, the etheric body was directed to experience the elementary ethe ric sphere between the earth and the moon. This exp erience corresponds to death itself, when after the death o f the physical body, the etheric body reviews the m emory tableau of the past life and then disperses into the etheri c sphere. Afterwards, the astral body and ego were directed to experience the astral spheres between the moon and sun. The final initiation was the single experience of Christ in the sun sphere and the successful candidate was hen ceforth referred to as a \"Christophoros.\" For the initiate, the return to the physical body a fter the three coffin days in the spiritual world, corresponds to a \"resurrection\" in which he was \"born again.\" In pre sent day, the etheric body can no longer be separat ed from the physical body without causing death, so this form o f initiation can no longer take place. However, the astral body and ego still separate every nite during sleep. The Adonis mysteries were \"solar\" in direction and experience while, the Ephesus mysteries of Diana an d Artemis were \"lunar\" in orientation. During the greater sol ar Egyptian mysteries of Osiris, the initiates lear ned that Christ could no longer be found in the sun sphere, since H e had begun His veiled descent thru the planetary s pheres to"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"earth for incarnation. After the mystery of Golgoth a, the solar initiates realized that Christ was bot h that former Sun- Spirit as well as the Nathan Jesus. Henceforth, the se initiates decided to transfer the mysteries of D eath and Resurrection from the fall equinox to the vernal eq uinox of the Easter festival and celebrate the Deat h and Resurrection of Christ. In doing this, the orientat ion of initiatic wisdom changed from the moon spher e to the sun sphere. Unfortunately, this mystery wisdom of Christ as the Sun-Spirit known to the early (solar) church fathe rs became suppressed and destroyed during the 4th century Rom anization of the Catholic church. However, the soul s of these cosmic Christians went on to participate in the sch ool of St. Michael in heaven during the 15th-16th-1 7th centuries and they still incarnate on earth within the Platon ic stream. Fortunately, over the centuries, Easter remains still a remembrance of the Death and Resurrection, although it has lost its cosmic significance. In conclusion, when we look at the cycle of light o f the tropical zodiac, we see ascending and descend ing forces centered around the equinoxes. In the annual cycle of the Breath of the Earth, we see the same ascendi ng and descending cycles, but they are centered around the solstices. Instead of a cycle of light which deriv es from the sun forces, we see a cycle of elementary nature spirits that derives from the earth forces of Ahriman. Wha t scientists now call \"nitrogen fixing bacteria\", the peasant wi sdom called gnomes, which do their work in winter t ime when these elementary beings are trapped inside the inha led breath of the earth. This is why the peasants f ertilized in the fall and not in the spring, as in the modern method THE SON OF GOD and THE SON OF MAN The Macro and Micro Cosmic Principles of the Cosmic Christ THE DOCETIC VISION It can be said that the principal of Doceticism had its origin in the so-called Apocryphal Gospels/Act s of the Alexandrian gnostics. The Islamic scholar extra-ord inaire, Henry Corbin, begins his treatise on Doceti cism and Ismailian Gnosis with a story from the Apocryphal A cts of Peter (sec. XX-XX1). The apostle Peter was d escribing his experience on the holy mount at the scene of th e Transfiguration to a group of people, including s everal widows, one of whom was blind. Peter says the following. \"Our Lord, willing that I should behold his majesty in the holy mount, I, when I with the sons of Zebedee saw the brightness of his light, fell as one dead and shut mine eyes, and heard such a voice from him as I am not able to describe, and thought myself to be blinded by his brightness. And when I recovered (breathed again) a little I sa id within myself: Peradventure my Lord hath brought me hither that he might blind me. And I sa id: If this also be thy will, Lord, I resist not. And he gave me his hand and raised me up; and when I arose I saw him again in such a form as I was able to take in.\" Now, the operative words in this experience are \"wh en I arose I saw him again in such a form as I was able to take in.\" In another Apocryphal gospel, the Acts of John (sec . 88-89), the brothers James and John were describi ng the calling of the apostles by Jesus, as follows. \"For when he had chosen Peter and Andrew, which were brethren, he cometh unto me and James my brother, saying: I have need of you, come unto me. And my brother hearing that, said: John, what would this child have that is upon the sea-shore and called us? And I said: What child? And he said to me again: That which beckoneth to us. And I answered: Because of our long watch we have kept at sea, thou seest not aright, my brother James; but seest thou not the man that standeth there, comely and fair and of a cheerful countenance? But he said to me: Him I see not, brother; but let us go forth and we shall see what he would have.\" Here, these two apostles in beholding Jesus, descri be first seeing a child calling them from the shore , then later again, this same person appears to them as a cheerf ul man of noble appearance. A few articles later in the Acts of John, John describes his vision of the figure of Je sus during the Transfiguration in varying degrees o f transcendence as follows."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"\"And at another time he taketh with him me and James and Peter unto the mountain where he was wont to pray, and we saw in him a light such as it is not possible for a man that useth corruptible (mortal) speech to describe what it was like. Again in li ke manner he bringeth us three up into the mountain, saying: Come ye with me. And we went again: and we saw him at a distance praying. I, therefore, because he loved me, drew nigh unto him softly, as though he could not see me, and stood looking upon his hinder parts: and I saw that he was not in any wise clad with garments, but was seen of us naked, and not in any wise as a man, and that his feet were whiter than any snow, so that the earth the re was lighted up by his feet, and that his head touched the heaven\" Finally, we can hear this same John of the Apocryph al Acts describe himself in varying degrees of tran scendence as follows. \"Thou hearest that I suffered, yet did I not suffer; that I suffered not, yet did I suffer; that I was pierced, yet I was not smitten; hanged, and I was not hanged; that blood fl owed from me, and it flowed not; and, in a word, what they say of me, that befell me not, but what they say not, that did I suffer.\" For Henry Corbin, Doceticism is not a set doctrine but a tendency for THOEPHANIC VISIONS by the person actively engaged in a spiritual experience of perce ption of angelic beings. For him, \" There is actual perception of an object, of a concrete person: the figure and the features are sharply defined, and yet it is not given to the perception of the sense organs. Thi s perception is essentially an event of the soul , taking place in the soul and for the soul. As such its reality is essentially individuated for and with each soul; what the soul really sees, it is in each case alone in seeing. The field of its vision, its horizon, is in e very case defined by the capacity, the dimension of its own being.\" John in the Acts defines this principal with his si mple formula \"I saw him again in such a form as I w as able to take in.\" This comment essentially defines Doceticism as a theophanic vision which in every case is proport ional to the theophanic dimension or capacity of the soul of the beholder. Thus, for the gnostic christian, Jesus did not suff er and die to the cross, only the simulacrum of his body, which suffered only in appearance. Although the gnostics possessed the tradition of the ancient wisdom, they could never understand the profundity of the incarnation of Chr ist in the Son of Man. This is in part the fault of the Ancient Wisdom itself, which always held that a god could n ot die to the earth, could not die on the physical plane. This tradition was expressly Hindu and Buddhist, wherein the incarnating spirit of both the Avatara and the Buddha, exited the physical body just prior to death. In fa ct, the adept actually practiced during his lifetim e the technique, called mahasamadhi, of allowing the spirit to trave l up the spine and depart the head thru the pineal gland. Even in the 20th. century we see in the death of Paramahans a Yogananda, the vital signs of his physical body s urviving some 20-30 days after death. The same phenomenon is also well respected in the many preserved bodies of sai nts of the catholic church. Traces of this gnostic Doceticism survived briefly in the works of Origen and Manichaeism, but found a foothold in the doctrines of the judeao-christian tradition of Ebionite Christianity. Ebionism had two major doctr ines that ran counter to Pauline Christianity. First was the prim acy of brother James as Bishop of Jerusalem over pe ter as Bishop of Rome. There was an ancient tradition that it was Saul who pushed James to his injury from the pinna cle of the temple and while surviving the fall, had him beaten to death with a fuller's club. This may be a karmi c source to the hostility to Pauline Christianity. The second doctrine was that of the True Prophet as incarnated in Adam. For the Ebionites, the first m an was the first form or vehicle of the True Prophet, sort of an Adam-Christos, which for Anthroposophists, would be akin to Adam and his sister-soul, the Nathan Jesus soul. Th e True Prophet was foretold by Moses in a successio n of epiphanic forms, in the incarnations of Enoch, Noah , Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses and Jesus. Judaism w as a prophetic mystery stream and when this Ebionite tra dition was carried over only a few centuries later to Islam, there appeared in Ismaili gnosis the doctrine of the Imam and its spokesperson, the prophet. (The Gnostic th read that also carried over to Manichaeism had a similar successio n of True Prophets in Adam, Seth, Noah, Jesus, Budd ha, Zoroaster and Mani)."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"By the time the Koran was written down we see a doc etic verse that says \"They slew Him not nor crucifi ed, but it appeared so unto them, and lo! Those who disagree c oncerning it are in doubt thereof; they have no kno wledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture. They slew Him not for certain.\" Thus, the docetic vision, carrie d forward thru Gnosticism, Ebionism and finally into Islam, does n ot deny the hypostatic union of the Christ spirit i n Jesus of Nazareth, but denies that the Christ spirit died to the cross. For them the penultimate words of Jesus on the cross \"MY God, MY God, why has thou LEFT ME\" are literall y true. The Nathan-Christ spirit must have fled the body of the Solomon Jesus before the physical death on Golg otha. THE FLEEING NAKED YOUTH This docetic problem still exists to this day. It i s Nicene Creed dogma for the catholic church that t he two natures of Christ were united in one person, which godly perso n suffered and died on the cross. Like wise, for an throposophy, it is dogma that the Christ was the first god to su ffer death on the physical plane. In a lecture 2 April 1922 Steiner says, \"Thus the Mystery of Golgotha meant this for the gods: a greater wealth of knowledge through the wisdom of death. If a god had not passed through death, the whole Earth would have become entirely intellectual, without ever reaching the evolution which t he gods had planned for it from the very beginning. \"But the esoteric element which Christ gave to his initiated disciples consi sted therein, that He told them: What took place on Golgotha, is the reflection of superterrestial e vents and of the relationship between the worlds of the gods connected with Saturn, Sun, Moon and the present Earth, and Ahriman. The cross of Golgotha cannot be looked upon as something earthly, but as something having a meaning for the entire universe - this was the content of esoteric Christianity. \"We must learn to fathom what the Christ himself taught to his initiated discipl es after his resurrection, and we must take for granted that he could impart such teachings only af ter having passed through an experience, here on earth, which he could not have had in the divine world - for until the Mystery of Golgotha death did not exist in the divine worlds. No being of the divine worlds had passed through death - Christ is the first-born who passed through death from the world of the hierarchies, connected with the evolution of the Earth that went through Saturn, Sun and Moon. \"The secret of Golgotha is the inclusion of death into life. Before Golgotha, the knowledge of life did not include death.\" Thus, it is a basic tenant of anthroposophic esoter ic christianity that both the Cosmic Christ and Jes us of Nazareth suffered death on the cross. Otherwise the Islamic principle of Doceticism is valid and Jesus was just another Avatara or True Prophet. Now the problem arises when one tries to reconcile this basic tenant with other lectures of Dr. Steine r, notably, those of the GOSPEL OF ST. MARK (1912) and BACKGROUND TO THE GOSPEL OF ST. MARK (1910). In Mark 14:51 we read \"and a youth was among His followers who wore a linen cloth about his body; and they sei zed him, but he left the linen cloth and fled naked.\" Now Dr. Steiner in his GSM 23 sept. 1912 says, \"Who was this youth? Who was it who escaped here? W ho is it that appears next to Christ Jesus nearly u nclothed, and then slips away unclothed? This is the youthful cosmic impulse, it is the Christ who slips away, w ho now only has a loose connection with the Son of Man...It is the entirely naked, new cosmic impulse of earth evo lution.\" And later Steiner relates that the youth found in t he tomb (Mark 16:1-6) after the resurrection of Jes us was, \"Also this same youth, ...the youth who slips away from the people at the moment when they condemn the Son of Man, who is there again when the three days are over, and from now onward is active as the cosmic principle of the earth.\""},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Therefore, we have two Jesus beings, one is called Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Man and the other is called the Cosmic Christ, the being who is the \"new cosmic imp ulse of earth evolution.\" However, how are we to se e the historical event of the death of a god on the cross , the basic tenant of esoteric christianity, if in fact, the Cosmic Christ abandoned the Son of Man on the cross in the spirit form of the fleeing naked youth, prior to t he crucifixion? As Oskar Kurten said in his article THE SON OF MAN AND THE COSMIC CHRIST, \"how then are we to understand the Cosmic Christ?...Christ could not possibly have separated from Jesus in Gethsemane but remained united with him even beyond death...it would be a complete contradiction to everything Steiner says concerning the M ystery of Golgotha, if we were to conclude that it had been only the human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who as the Son of Man, suffered death on the cross.\" Kurten proposes a strictly Steiner like solution to the dilemma by separating out from the Son of Man those higher spiritual forces of the Cosmic Christ, which withdr ew from Christ Jesus on the cross, in the image of the fleeing youth. However, he wrongly concludes that these hig her forces of the Cosmic Christ, after death, reuni te with the risen Christ to \"live in their triune oneness as th e spirit of the earth in human souls ON EARTH.\" The re is no cosmic merger of the three separate microcosmic and macroc osmic principles (manas, buddhi and atma) of the Ch rist being living in or on the earth. Only the macrocosmic ego of the Cosmic Christ lives in the earth, or on the earth. The other higher spiritual forces to which Dr. Steiner referr ed actually live outside the earth and on the sun, which is a matter to be taken up later. The bible scholar, Edward Smith, also proposes a so lution in his book THE DISCIPLE WHOM JESUS LOVED. Here he says that the fleeing naked youth is in fac t the risen Lazarus-John person, in whom those high er spiritual forces of the Cosmic Christ, have united. And it wa s also the risen Lazarus-John who appeared in the t omb after the resurrection. This certainly is a plausible explana tion considering that Lazarus not only experienced a personal initiation by Jesus, but was actually raised from t he dead, creating possibilities for higher than nor mal angels to incarnate in him. However, Lazarus can only be cons idered a temporary carrier of these higher principl es until the time of the resurrection, at which time these were disbursed into the etheric and astral spheres surro unding the earth.. For me the solution comes from an evaluation of the correspondences of the macrocosmic principles of t he Cosmic Christ and the microcosmic principles of Jesus Chri st, the Son of Man. THE SON OF GOD and the SON OF MAN Ever wonder why our personal memory only extends ba ck to a certain age in early childhood? Maybe 3 or 4 years old. My parents told me that I r ode a 20 inch bicycle and age 2 and 3. Later, when I was 4 or 5 I got a new bike and I couldn't ride it, I had to lea rn to ride it all over again with training wheels. Why shouldn't riding a bike be like swimming, that once learned, never f orgotten? Was it because I was two different person s, and had no link between the two? In a very real sense, we are two different persons living two very different stages of life. The first person and age is from birth to the emergence of our personal ego at which time our personal memory begins. I look back at these first 2 or 3 years as my age of 'cosmic memory.' During l ife I have a feeling about certain things that I kn ow occurred during these years but, I have no memory recollecti on of the events. For example, when in my local chu rch, I frequently think of seeing angels during mass, some thing that I know happened in my early years, but h ave no memory of it. Likewise, my cosmic memory tells me t hat as a child, when sitting alone in the bathtub, I had lots of little friends there, with me. That's why I carried on the practice later in childhood of having littl e plastic men to play with in the tub. Then there is a 'crossing over' that occurs between the cosmic memory and the emergence of the persona l ego at age 3 or 4. From that time onwards, the cosmic memory i s forever lost and our ego self-consciousness begin s. This second person and second age of life lasts until de ath. Our personal life memories extend back only to the beginning of this second life. In that most remarkable of little books, THE SPIRIT UAL GUIDANCE OF HUMANITY, Dr. Steiner describes how the infant for up to three years is lead by the for ces of higher angels. In a microcosmic recapitulati on and reflection of the three sacrifices of the pre-incarnated Chris t, these spiritual angels teach the infant, first t o stand up and walk, to orient itself in space. Second, to learn how to speak, in the Noam Chomsky sense, to learn language . And third, to think with human reason. The capacities to stand up , speak and think are not hereditary, but come out of ourselves. But what goes into the infant as influences come fr om the higher spirits. As Steiner says, \"once we are no longer soft and malleable as children, we can no longer stand to have t he forces of the spiritual world continue to affect us directly...higher forces that have a"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"decisive influence on us in childhood can work on us for THREE YEARS....if we could somehow remove the I from a person...and replace it with an I that is connected with the spiritual worlds, after three years this persons body would fall apart. \" After these three years, these higher forces give w ay to the incoming ego consciousness and our person al memory begins our cosmic memory fades into the subconsciou s. So we may say there are two distinct periods in a human life, the first three years when the child is lead thru physical development and the remaining years o f lifetime. In the microcosmic man, we may refer to these two stages a s the son of god and the son of man. What are these \"higher forces\" that lead the child' s life for three years and are so powerful, that if they didn't leave, the physical body would be destroyed?? Steiner is v ery non-committal about naming them, but he leaves a few telling hints. He says that \"what lives within us ( in childhood) is truly a higher, divine human being and we can feel ourselves pervaded by this being as by a living pre sence of whom we can say THIS IS MY INNER GUIDE...t his higher I is connected to the spiritual hierarchies. ..and has been there all along.\" The spiritual hier archies to which Steiner refers are those of the Archons, Archangels and Angels, working in us as the higher principles of atma, buddhi and manas. In one sense, we can say that at birth our microcosmic atma unfolds, guiding the dev elopment of the fetus thru ontogeny. After birth, our personal buddhi and manas unfold during the life of the cosm ic memory until the birth of the personal ego. At the same ti me, our mother's heriditary etheric and astral bodi es sheath our personal ego, until, at second teeth, our personal etheric body forms and later at puberty, our person al astral body forms. It is the presence of these three higher ang elic hierarchies that guide our embryonic and early childhood development that can only last a few short years an d must leave actively working in the physical body. After their withdrawal, they still continue to work in us, inac tively however, only during sleep throughout the re mainder of our adult life.. This higher I, this inner guide is of course our pe rsonal buddhi principle working unconsciously in us during early childhood. As such, it is directly connected to the higher archangelic hierarchies. It has to leave th e body when our personal ego arrives because we have not evolved fa r enough to let the higher I live within us for an entire lifetime. We can only experience glimpses of it. This higher I, when properly developed, will also become our Ch rist within us. In the microcosm, Christ is the buddhi spirit o f humanity. As our personal ego evolves unselfish l ove, we replace our personal I with the higher I of Christ, not my ego, but the Christ within me. That is why Steiner said \"to know the forces at work in childhood is to know the Chri st within us.\" Dr. Steiner further describes these two periods in the life of a man in BGSM ch. six as follows: \" Two periods of development, each very different from the other, are apparent in man' s life between birth and death in every incarnation. One of these periods lies betwee n birth and the point at which an individual's memory begins. Just think how much is taken in during the first three years of life; yet modern man has no remembrance a t all of how the impressions were made. It is only at the point from which memories begin that he gradually detaches himself from his environment as an independent being. \" In the Pauline sense, this first period is called t he \"Son of God.\" The second period, from after the beginning of memory until the end of life, is called the \"Son of Man.\" Dr. Steiner says \"This is the spirit which i n Pauline christianity is called 'the Son of Man'. Here is a concept which you must grasp-the concept of the Son of Man, who can be found in a human being onwards from the poin t in his life to which his later memory extends, an d includes everything he has acquired from the civilization ar ound him.\" We may think of the life of the Jesus of Nazareth from age 12 to the incarnation at age 30 as His period o f the Son of Man. In the incarnation of Christ we also see the same c orrespondence. The indwelling Cosmic Christ spirit could only live in the physical body of Nathan Jesus also for three years. This is His period of the Son of God. In the same sense that in the microcosm for human childhood, th ere lived a higher spirit which guides the infancy of a child, so too in the macrocosmic life of Christ, there lived for three years, a higher spirit that guided His li fe. That higher spirit was THE FATHER. In the same sense that the buddhi spirt lives in th e child for three years and then departs, so too th e Father spirit lived in Jesus for three years and finally departed durin g the agony on the cross. And, in Christ, the Son o f God merged with the Son of Man, in reverse order. The Father f orces incarnated during the baptism lived along sid e and in union with the other macrocosmic principles of manas and buddhi. But for the Cosmic Christ, his buddhi was t he Father living in Him for three years, hence the saying \" I and the Father are one.\" For us as humans, our hig her I or higher ego is the Christ. For Christ, His higher ego or bu ddhi, was the Father within him."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"In a very real sense, what caused the destruction o f the physical body of Jesus of Nazareth was the su preme forces of the Father living in the Son of Man. Steiner says h ere, \"In the normal man of today these two forms of consciousness are separate: indeed they must be sep arate, for thy are incompatible. Nor were they any more compatible in Christ Jesus himself; after those thr ee years, death was bound to supervene. ...These circumstances...came about because these two lived within each other....the living together of the Son of God and the Son of Man\" However, slowly, slowly, the Son of Man and the Son of God separated. Dr. Steiner remarked in his GSMK lectures that \" toward the end of His life Jesus of Nazareth was more and more alone, and the Christ became eve r more loosely connected with Him. Although the cosmic ele ment was there until the moment pictured as that of the sweating of blood in Gethsemane and Christ at this moment was fully united with Jesus of Nazareth, now through the failure of human beings to understand this conn ection, the link was loosened.\" It was during this sweating of the blood, that the cosmic Christ ego, fully penetrated His physical body, causing the phantom body to ari se as the \"new Adam.\" This link slowly slipped away as the troops of Caiaphas drew near and touched Jesus and bound H im with ropes. Finally, the 'cosmic element' fully departed in the naked fleeing youth. But Steiner makes it c lear that these cosmic forces still continued to \"hover around Him \" and they later returned to the tomb after the res urrection. After the departure of the naked fleeing youth Stei ner remarks that \"all that was left was the Son of Man.\" This was a strong statement and does not really reflect the whole picture, that still within the Son of Man was the macrocosmic Ego of the Father. Steiner uses several different terms for the cosmic qualities of his Co smic Christ. One is the \"youthful cosmic element\" and another is just the \"cosmic element\". He lumps together the m acrocosmic elements of the ego, manas and buddhi of the Cosmic Christ together with the \"youthful cosmic impulse\" of the Father. If we take them separately, one element bei ng the twofold macrocosmic manas and buddhi princip les of the Cosmic Christ and the other element being the singl e macrocosmic ego described by Steiner as the 'yout hful cosmic element' of the Father, i think we can distinguish a different picture. Although the two-fold principles of the Cosmic Chri st departed in the figure of the fleeing naked yout h, the forces of the Father, as working into the macrocosmic ego, ne ver left Christ Jesus until the death on the cross. The sixth saying from the cross \"MY God, My God, why has thou forsaken Me?\" is a symbol for the ego of Christ la menting the departure of the Father spirit in him just befo re the instant of physical death. Even though I said (above) that Christ's buddhi was the Father active in Him, and that Christ's buddhi left in the figure of the fleeing youth, this does not necessar ily mean that the Father as buddhi departed and did not stay with the Son of Man until the final moment of death on t he cross. For the human, the relationship between t he ego and the buddhi principal is that of the likeness to the image, the personal ego to the higher ego. Buddhi, the arc hetypal image of the celestial/sidereal ego, rays into the perso nal ego and as it develops, it transforms the ether ic body, opening the seven etheric chakras. But in man, this transformation has never been carried to perfectio n. This is the work of the New Adam of St. Paul. In Christ, by contrast, the forces of the Father as buddhi, during the 3 ½ years, transformed His ethe ric body until perfection was achieved in the \"phantom body\" of th e resurrection. This work of the New Adam was for the first time completed during the sweating of the blood dur ing the night in Gethsemane. At this moment in time , the microcosmic atma, worked over by the cosmic ego dur ing the 3 ½ years, united with the physical body of the Son of Man. Then, as Dr. Steiner says, the thread between the cosmic ego of Christ and the Cosmic buddhi of t he Father was loosened until they finally separated in the fi gure of the naked fleeing youth. The difference is that in man, complete perfection is never achieved, whereas in C hrist, perfection was achieved down into the physic al body so far as microcosmic atma (the Macrocosmic Atma being left on the sun). The proof of the New Adam being the perfect etheric body, the \"phantom body\" of the res urrected Christ. After the sweating of the blood in Gethsemane, the Father forces could depart, after having transf ormed the ego of the Christ and the work of the new creation having been achieved. In the microcosm, Christ is the buddhi force active in humanity as Higher Ego, transforming the lower ego thru love and community. In the macrocosm, the Father acted a s the buddhi force active within the Christ Jesus a s the \"youthful impulse\" described by Dr. Steiner. But th e youthful forces of the Father acted throughout al l of the principles of the Cosmic Christ, worked upwards int o His manas and buddhi, and downwards into His astr al and etheric bodies, right down deeply into the physical body as microcosmic atma. So when the cosmic princ iples of manas and buddhi left the Son of Man in the figure of the naked fleeing youth, the forces of the Fathe r still remained in the macrocosmic ego of the Son of Man. The Son o f Man was alone and cut off from His manas and budd hi, but was still in the living grace of the Father active in His ego. Otherwise, what could have possibly kept alive the Son of Man during the incredible tortures of the pa ssion? No human being, nor the Son of Man himself, could have survived the scourging, the crown of thorns, the b eating of the guards, the carrying of the cross and the nailing t o the cross. Only the forces of the Father still ac tive in Jesus could"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"have taken the Son of Man from Gethsemane to the hi ll of Golgotha. The sixth saying from the cross \"MY God, My God, why has thou forsaken Me?\" truly is a symbol f or the ego of Christ lamenting the departure of the Father spirit in him just before the instant of physical death. When the Father spirit finally left the physical bo dy of Christ, these cosmic forces too, still contin ued to \"hover around Him \" and they later returned to the tomb af ter the resurrection. It is here that Oskar Kurten makes his error. For him, these higher forces of the Cosmic Christ t hat return to the tomb, reunite with the risen Chri st to \"live in their triune oneness as the spirit of the earth in human souls ON EARTH.\" However, as we have describe d, only the Macrocosmic ego of the risen Christ remained on ear th. His other forces of manas, buddhi and atma live in the earths atmosphere and on the sun. These are gifts t o the future mankind as now explained. CHRIST DIED TO THE SUN In the lecture series KARMIC RELATIONSHIPS Vol. VII I, Steiner says, \" Christ dies to the sun...He went forth from the sun as we human beings go forth from the earth when we die...after His cosmic death, Christ left His Spirit-Man ( atma) on the sun and around the earth, His Life-Spirit (buddhi). So that after the mystery of Golg otha the earth was swathed as it were by the Life-Spirit of the Christ....and bring ing down His ego and His spirit-self (manas) to the earth \" This is how to think of it. We humans DIE TO THE EA RTH and GO TO THE SUN. When we die, we leave our physical body here on earth, our etheric body dispe rses into the atmosphere and our astral body crosse s the first threshold into purgatory, the moon sphere. After ou r penance there, we leave our astral shell in purga tory and then cross the second threshold on into the sun sphere, for lower and higher heaven devachan. Thus, our per sonal ego joins our spiritual trinity of manas, buddhi and at ma to sojourn in the spiritual worlds of the sun an d slightly beyond. until the moment of cosmic midnight, when we then r etrace our path thru the spheres downwards back to incarnate again on earth. Thus, after death we basically trav el from the earth, to the moon and to the sun and r eturn again for our next incarnation. For the Cosmic Christ, the process was just the rev erse, for He DIED TO THE SUN and WENT TO THE EARTH. The Cosmic Christ, as a macrocosmic being, also has His higher principles of atma, buddhi and manas. W hen He left the sun sphere to incarnate in the Son of Man during the baptism, He died to the sun, as we die t o the earth, but instead of leaving his physical body, as we do here on earth, He left His ATMA, on the sun. Because of this occult fact, it was not the MACroco smic atma of the Son of God that penetrated the phy sical body down to the bones during the sweating of blood in G ethsemane, but His MICrocosmic atma, into which the Forces of the Father had worked thru the macrocosmic ego o f the Cosmic Christ. Dr. Steiner had said many time s that the forces of the Cosmic Christ FULLY PENETRATED the ph ysical body of Christ Jesus, the final and deepest penetration coming during the sweating of blood dur ing the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, at a tim e when the Son of God and the Son of Man were still fully unit ed. But this must only be understood to mean the mi crocosmic atma that penetrated, since the macrocosmic atma fo rces had been left in the sun sphere. Was this microcosmic penetration sufficient to acco mplish the goal of a creating the etheric Phantom Body of a New Adam? Yes, because the penetration occurred when the Fath er forces of the Son of God were united in the Son of Man. Even though the forces of the Son of God later departed in the fleeting naked youth, the atmic ac t was consecrated in the sweating of the blood. The active Father forces, working thru the macrocos mic ego of the Son of God, replaced the atma of the Son of Man, to accomplish the same deed. It was in effect a replacement between the forces of the Father for the abandoned atma forces of Christ Jesus, left on the sun for th e future development of humanity. It can be better understood in relation to the future of humanity, when the macroc osmic atma of the Cosmic Christ will be used for th e other purposes of: (1) the resurrection of the dead at th e end of this manvantara cycle during the reunifica tion of the earth planet into the sun and (2) the reunification of th e sun and earth at the end of the Vulcan manvantara . (which purpose will be discussed later) The other principles of the Cosmic Christ were disp ersed as follows. After the death of the Son of Man on the cross, the macrocosmic ego of the Cosmic Christ, DIED TO T HE EARTH, and became part of the earth's interior, the earth as Holy Grail chalice. The macrocosmic MANAS of the Cosmic Christ, was left in the earth's atmos phere as the Fifth Gospel, LEFT TO THE FUTURE OF MANKIND, as the imaginations of the Cosmic Christ. The macrocosmic BUDDHI of the Cosmic Christ, was also l eft above the earth's atmosphere, LEFT TO THE FUTUR E OF MANKIND, as the sphere of the returning Etheric Christ."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Now simply said, the fleeing naked youth is a symbo l for the higher spiritual principles of the Cosmic Christ, the macrocosmic manas and buddhi, which were left in th e earths atmosphere for the future use of mankind. (And not united in some triune oneness as described by Mr. K urten) In our first conclusion, we have the four higher co smic principles of the Cosmic Christ as follows: 7. atma, in the sun; 6. buddhi, in the atmosphere surrounding the earth; 5. manas, on earth, but in a surrounding sphere, ab ove earth; and 4. MACrocosmic ego, in earth, forever united with t he planetary evolution of earth, as the Holy Grail. THE MACROCOSMIC EGO of the COSMIC CHRIST However, it is important to understand the differen ce between the Microcosmic and Macrocosmic principl es in the Cosmic Christ. Hopefully, this is not some pinhead exercise in modern scholasticism. In the above sche me, only no. 4, the Ego of Christ is Macrocosmic as to humanity and this solar system. The manas, buddhi and atma o f the Cosmic Christ are microcosmic. Dr. Steiner explains this difference in his lecture the COSMIC EGO AND HUMAN EGO (9 Jan 1912), \"The Christ is quite radically different from other beings who share in ear th evolution. The Christ was not directly connected with earth evolution, but with the sun evolution. He is a being who remained behind , not only during Moon evolution, but also during the Old Sun evolution. His evolutionary conditions were such that this macrocosmic Christ being evolved the macrocosmic ego outside earthly conditions. He was a macrocosm ic being from the beginning of earth evolution, on. The Christ, then, is a four membered being, including His macrocosmic ego, just as man himself is microcosmically a four membered being.\" In the same vein, Dr Steiner in his lecture of 18 N ov 1911 reprinted in the book ESOTERIC CHRISTIANITY AND THE MISSION OF CHRISTIAN ROSENCRUTZ says, \"Since the Saturn stage, throughout the Sun and Moon stage, man has developed his physical, etheric and astral bodies. The ego could only appear on earth in a body tha t was sufficiently prepared for it and then develop further under the nuturing influence of the Christ impulse because Christ is macrocosmically what our ego is to us microcosmically...Christ is a macrocosmic being at the fourth stage of His macrocosmic development, as man is microcosmically at the fourth stage. So you should keep macrocosmic and microcosmic principles apart, but be clear about the fact tha t the first four macrocosmic principles include of course all the higher microcosmic princi ples.\" As a human, our ego principle was a gift poured out from the cosmos by the Holy Spirit and the Spirits of Form. The sphere of the ego descended during the middle of th e Atlantean Age and since that time, humans have ab sorbed from it their microcosmic ego, which over time has now become hereditary as the ego is now implanted d uring fetus development. However, as a microcosmic principle, t he destiny of our human ego is limited to the exist ence of this Fourth Earth manvantara. Although we may be able to partially evolve the higher principles of manas, b uddhi and atma during earth evolution, the evolution of these higher principles depend on Luciferic beings, whic h are only microcosmic in development. These higher principles are in a sense only grafted unto humans. Even Anthroposophists find this difficult to unders tand, because in effect, the Cosmic Christ as prese ntly membered is a lower spiritual being than say, Lucifer. Becau se the luciferic beings have as a whole already dev eloped their fifth manas principle and some have partially devel oped their sixth and seventh principles, they stand higher than man and higher, in this respect, than the Christ. D r. Steiner says that this is the basis for the posi tion of the anti- christ against the Christ in the future of humanity , because, the anti-christ will have more fully dev eloped its higher principles. However, these luciferic beings have on ly developed these higher principles MICrocosmicall y, whereas the Christ has developed His ego MACrocosmically, w hich is infinitely more important than all microcos mic principles combined. Another problem that Anthroposophists have is Dr. S teiner's statement that as presently membered, \"the Christ is a macrocosmic being at the fourth stage of His macroc osmic development.\" I really have never met any ant hropop who really understands what this means, cosmically. Most anthropops say that because He is the world c reator"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Logos of the beginning of the John gospel, that He is a fully developed twelve membered being and has always been such. But this certainly is not the case. Dr. Steiner goes further in his description of the principles of the cosmic Christ in this lecture (ab ove) of the 9 Jan. 1912 as follows. \"The Christ being is a being who in a certain sense is like the human being, only that m an is microcosmic and has brought his four principles to expression microcosmically , and hence has his ego also microcosmically as earth-ego-but the Christ as cosmic Ego. His evolution was such that He was great and significant because the perfect developm ent of this ego, which He brought down to earth. And he had not the fifth macrocosmic principle, and not the sixth, for HE WILL EVOLVE THESE ON JUPITER AND VENUS, IN ORDER THAT HE MAY GIVE THEM TO MAN. Now each macrocosmic principle has an inner relationship to the corresponding microcosmic principle; the f ourth macrocosmic principle in the Christ corresponds to the fourth microcosmic principle in man, and the fifth in the Christ will correspond to the Spirit-Self in man.\" What this means is that the Christ is not a fully d eveloped cosmic being, but more structured as follo ws in our second conclusion; 7. Microcosmic atma, in the sun sphere; 6. Microcosmic buddhi, in the atmosphere surroundin g the earth; 5. Microcosmic manas, on earth, but in a surroundin g sphere, above earth; and 4. MACrocosmic ego, in earth, forever united with t he planetary evolution of earth, as the Holy Grail. The spheres of our microscopic manas, buddhi and at ma are the spheres of imaginations of beings that l ived thru the Old Moon manvantara. The record of their thoughts, feeling and will were preserved and passed on and o ver to the Earth manvantara during the recapitulations of Satu rn, Sun and Moon. Preserved as cosmic imaginations for our Earth evolution, they become our higher spheres of imagination, inspiration and intuition, to which we ascend after we complete our cycle of self-consciousness during the evolution of our sentient soul, mind soul and c onsciousness soul. However, as great as these gifts are, they ar e still only microcosmic in nature, they are gifts from partially evolved microcosmic beings as are ourselves. When the Cosmic Christ gave up His macrocosmic ego to mankind during His death on the cross of Golgoth a, He gave us a chance to participate in His ego, which w ill last throughout the entire planetary manvantara s of Jupiter, Venus and Vulcan. As the Cosmic Christ is a macroco smic being at His fourth (ego) stage of His macroco smic evolution, so is man at his fourth-ego-stage of his microcosmic evolution. However, to the extent that we absorb His cosmic ego within us, so we also participate in His macrocosmic evolution. What this means is that Christ will come again to u s during the Jupiter manvantara wherein He will dev elop His fifth macrocosmic principle. Like wise, Christ will come again during the Venus manvantara wherein He will d evelop His sixth macrocosmic principle and so into the las t seventh Vulcan manvantara, wherein His atma, pres erved on the sun, will also be given to mankind. Thus, during th e Jupiter manvantara, the macrocosmic Manas princip le of the Cosmic Christ will also be given to humanity in the same sense that His macrocosmic ego was given to m ankind during His death on the cross. And, during the Venu s manvantara, the macrocosmic Buddhi principle of t he Cosmic Christ will also be given to humanity. And during t he Vulcan manvantara, the macrocosmic Atma will be given to the earth and humanity for that transition of the e arth into a new sun. In each manvantara, the Cosmic Christ retrieves his microcosmic manas, buddhi and atma, l eft behind in the earth and sun spheres and transfo rms them, into macrocosmic principles, for the benefit of hum anity. And as humans, during our future evolutions, we participate in His cosmic evolution to the extend t hat we take the Christ impulse within us. As Dr. St einer said (above) \" Thus the Christ being is a being who in a certain sense is like a human being...He had not t he fifth macrocosmic principle and not the sixth, for He wil l evolve these on Jupiter and on Venus, in order TH AT HE MAY GIVE THEM TO MAN.\" Finally, we can see how the fully developed Cosmic Christ will evolve with us over the next three manv antaras as follows: 7. MACrocosmic atma, to be achieved during Vulcan e volution. 6. MACrocosmic buddhi, to be achieved during Venus evolution; 5. MACrocosmic manas, to be achieved during Jupiter evolution; 4. MACrocosmic ego, achieved during Earth evolution ."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Thus, mankind evolves its higher principles in unio n with the Cosmic Christ. At the beginning of each new manvantara, all levels of being go up a notch. At t he present time, The Cosmic Christ is membered as a nine-fold cosmic being, who will become 10 fold during the Ju piter manvantara, 11 fold during the Venus manvanta ra and finally, a fully developed twelve-fold being during the Vulcan manvantara. At this future time, the 12 fold-ness of the Cosmic Christ will reach up to the constellatio n of Aries, the Mystical Lamb. In a lecture of 28 Oct 1923 Dr. Steiner said, \"in t he pineal gland, the optic thalamus secretes out of itself the so- called brain sand, the mineral element of the head. ...It is actually in this mineral deposit that the spirit-man (atma) is anchored; and this immediately shows that what is l iving cannot harbour the spirit, but that the spiri t in man needs something non-living as its center, which means tha t above all else it must be a spirit with independe nt life.\" Likewise, it is in the mineral deposit of gold form ing a non-living center of the earth to which is an chored the atma of Christ that He left on the sun. In the last Vulc an manvantara, the spiritual alchemy of the earth's gold and the Christ's atma will join to transform the earth into the new sun of the next cycle of planetary evoluti on. 28 jan 02 THE SEPHER YETZIRAH 1. The Source in Abraham The most comprehensive way to summarize the Laws of 3, 12 and 22 is by correspondence to the Sephir Ye tzirah, the oldest text of occult Kabbalist Hebrew wisdom. The source of the text is attributed to the foundin g father, Abraham, which of course, extends back to the beginning of the Hebrew sub-race. But what were Abraham's sou rces? There would seem to be only two possible sour ces. The first source could have been the ancient Chalde an wisdom of Babylonia. We know from the Bible, tha t Abraham came to Canaan from Ur in Chaldea. Thus, th e text of the S.Y. could have originated in the anc ient wisdom of the Chaldean initiates of the mystery cen ter existent there. The other source could arise after Abraham arrived in Canaan and met the high priest Melchizedek in Sa lem. Who was this strange figure described in Hebrews as, \"For this Melchizedek, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, met Abraham returning from the slau ghter of the Kings and blessed him. He is first, by translation of his name, King of Righteousness, and then also K ing of Salem, that is King of Peace. He is without father or moth er or genealogy, and has neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.\" The Letter to the Hebrews is a New Testament book f ound in the Dead Sea Scrolls located in Qumran labe led 11 Qmelchizedek, which clearly gives eternal life to t his priest to whose order the \"Son of God\", Jesus b elonged. As revealed in the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Essene mon ks recognized Melchizedek as the heavenly high prie st who guided the incarnation of Christ through the geneal ogy of Abraham to the birth in Bethlehem. This spir itual connection is exoterically described in Genesis in the giving of bread and wine to Abraham and later r ealized in the giving of bread and wine at the Last Supper by Chri st to his Apostles. The highest regard given to Melchizedek by the Esse nes absolutely confirms the spiritual research of R . Steiner who says that \"Malek-Zadek\" was the occult name of this priest of the great oracle center presumably locat ed in the volcanic rift of Jerusalem known as the Tyropoeon v alley. As described in Occult Science, the evolutio n of the seven root races during the Atlantean epoch was gui ded by initiates through seven mystery centers or o racles. Thus, on the one line of evolution and oracle wisdom stoo d the Saturn, Jupiter and Mars initiates. On the ot her side stood"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"the Venus, Mercury and Vulcan initiates and in the middle were the sun or Christ initiates. At seven d ifferent locations on our planet were the seven mystery orac les guarded by the initiates. When the Atlantis civ ilization was destroyed, the great sun oracle initiate led a new colony of survivors from the West (Ireland) to the East (Indus Valley) and re-established the seven mystery-oracle centers to guide humanity through the post-Atlante an epoch. The seven Rishis were the first teachers of the fir st Hindu cultural epoch initiated by this great sun -oracle leader named Manu. Later, Zarathustra was initiated as the leading spiritual force of the second cultural epo ch. Hermes was the leader of the third cultural epoch arising in t he Egyptian-Chaldean peoples. The Semites were a su b-race of the fourth Greek-Roman cultural epoch. Abraham was the progenitor of this sub-race and Malak-Zadek was his occult teacher. Melchi-Zadek or King Zadek takes his title from the Hebrew name for the residing spirit of th e planet Jupiter-ZADEK. Thus, Malek-Zadek was the leader of the Jupiter race and the Jupiter oracle. Thus, we see that the meeting between Melchizedek a nd Abraham at Salem was esoterically an initiation into the Jupiter oracle center by Abraham which resulted in, among other things, the source of the text of the S.Y. The key to the mission of Abraham is described in t he S.Y. as \"the Lord most high revealed himself.. a nd made a covenant with him (Abraham) and his seed\". Now the seed of Abraham grew into two branches. The first w as the Hebrew nation derived through his son Isaac with hi s wife Sarah. The second was the Arab nation derive d through his son Ishmael with his Egyptian wife Hagar. The t ask of the Hebrew people was also twofold. First, t hrough the genealogy of blood, the Hebrew people prepared the physical, etheric and astral bodies through the thr ee times fourteen generations described in the beginning of the St. Matthew gospel to serve as a perfect crucib le in which to receive the ego of the Christ at the baptism at the Jordan. The second task was to prepare the mind to recogniz e the significance of the Christ event for future h umanity. The great sun initiate Malek-Zadek gave genetically to Abraham's brain an organ to observe the phenomena o f the external physical world and to relate these sense i mpressions into number, measure and weight. Thus, A braham is the father of constructive reasoning and mathematic al logic which is clearly evident in the Semitic su b-race of the Hebrews. This genetic change evident in the Hebrew descendants of Abraham was accomplished by a mergin g of the etheric body closely with the physical head whi ch transformed a portion of the physical brain into the actual organ of thought. In other sub-races living at the time of Abraham, t he physical and etheric bodies were more separated in varying degrees which resulted in the Atavistic clairvoyanc e in the brain and unlimited ancestral memory in th e etheric body. The old ancestral consciousness was symbolica lly represented by the snake and the newly propagat ing mathematical consciousness was represented by the t wo horns of the lamb. The later is graphically repr esented by Michelangelo's portrait of Moses with two horns pro truding from his forehead (the so-called two-petall ed lotus). Here is the fountain source of the gift from Melchi zedek to Abraham, the S.Y. is the occult text of th e cosmology of the universe written according to number, measure a nd weight as reflected through the Laws of 3, 7 and 12. 2. The Hebrew Alphabet as Logos The text of the S.Y. divides the 22 letters o f the Hebrew alphabet into three sections, the firs t as:"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" \"The three mothers Aleph, Mem & Shin are a great my stery... and from them proceed air, fire and water, which divide into male and female forces...and from them have proceeded all things that are in the wor ld.\" This of course recognizes the primary law of three, as reflected in the three mother letters, as the m oving forces which create the cosmos. As discussed in Cha pter One, 3., the Law of Three represents the unman ifest trinity of forces active, passive and neutralizing. The letter aleph is an aspirate, pronounced with a silent breathing and for this reason correlates to the primordial substance air. The letter mem is a mute produced by the pressing together of the lips. The fish is the silent resident of water and for this reason, t his letter correlates to the primordial element wat er. The letter shin is a sibilant and pronounced with a his sing sound and for this reason correlates to the pr imordial element of fire. Additional correspondences are described in the S.Y . as follows: SHIN ALEPH MEM Microcosm Primal fire Spirit air Water Universe Heavens Atmosphere Earth Elements Terrestrial Fire Air Water, Earth Man Head Chest Stomach"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Season Heat (summer) Temperate Cold (winter) \"The seven double letters beth (B), gimel (G), dale th (D), Kaph (K), pe (P), resh (R), and tau (T,TH). .. are called double, because each letter represents a contrast o r permutation...and He (Jehovah) preferred the numb er seven above all things under Heaven.\" This, of course, recognizes the Law of Seven as the maker of the manifest world, in duality or double letters. Thus, the S.Y. describes the manifest world of the 7 plan ets, the 7 Heavens, the 7 earths, 7 Sabbaths, 7 day s of creation, 7 gateways of the soul of man (7 orifices), 7 days of the week and every 7th year a jubilee. In addition , the text recognizes the 7 directions of space as north, sout h, east, west, above, below and the holy palace in the center of them. This corresponds to our hidden cube within th e Tetractys on page 51, herein. Additional correspo ndences are described in the S.Y. as follows from each of the s even days in the week. 1. Beth Wisdom moon right eye 2. Gimel Health mars right ear 3. Daleth Fertility venus right nose 4. Kaph Life sun left eye 5. Pe Power mercury left ear 6. Resh Peace saturn left nose 7. Tau Beauty jupiter mouth \"The twelve simple letters are heh, vau, zain, chet h, teth, yod, lamed, nun, samech, oin, tzaddi and q oph...they are the foundations of these 12 properties, sight, hear ing, smell, speech, taste, sexual love, work, movem ent, anger, mirth, imagination and sleep... and formed with the m the 12 celestial constellations of the zodiac.\" This, of course, recognizes the Law of Twelve in th e macrocosm (zodiac) and the microcosm (man). In ad dition, the S.Y. describes 12 directions in space as the \"arms of the universe\" which corresponds to our 12 degree s of freedom on page 89. Additional correspondences are describe d in the text as follows: 1. He Aries march right foot 2. Vau Taurus april right kidney 3. Zain Gemini may left foot 4. Cheth Cancer june right hand 5. Teth Leo july left kidney 6. Yod Virgo august left hand 7. Laured Libra september sex organs 8. Nun Scorpio october intestines 9. Samech Sagittarius november stomach 10. Oin Capricorn december liver 11. Tzaddi Aquarius january gullet 12.Qoph Pisces february spleen Thus, we see that the S. Y. establishes the Hebrew alphabet as the Logos and the instrument of creatio n in itself. It also establishes for the first time, the concept of the unmanifest trinity in the words,\"the three are one and that one stands above\". It establishes the manifest world of seven in the words, \"the seven are divided, three are over against three and one stands between the triads.\" And final ly, it establishes the microcosm and macrocosm of m an in the universe expressed by the Law of Twelve. The laws o f the triad, Heptad and dodecad are shown in Plat o f 22 letters . 3. The 231 Gates A greater mystery of the S.Y. is that of the 231 ga tes. In Chapter II it is revealed, 4. These 22 letters, which are the foundation of al l things, He arranged as upon a sphere with 231 gat es, and the sphere may be rotated forward or backward, whether for good or for evil, from the good comes true plea sure, from evil, nought but torment. 5. For He shewed the combination of these letters, each with the other; Aleph with all and all with Al eph; Beth with all, and all with Beth. Thus, in combining all toge ther in pairs are produced 231 gates of knowledge. What are the 231 gates? Clearly, the commentaries on this mystery set the 2 31 gates as a permutation of pairing each of the 22 letters with each other such as aa, ab, ad, ag, etc. However, th is is not a solution since this permutation adds up to 242 not 231. Likewise, the commentary in the William Wynn Westco tt edition says, \"the number 242 is obtained by add ing together all the numbers from 1 to 22. The Hebrew l etters can be placed in pairs in 242 different posi tions.\" This also is not a solution because the numbers added to gether equal 253, not 231. Further, Westcott adds, \"for the reason why eleven are deducted, and the number 231 specifi ed, see table and note 15 in the edition of Postell us.\""},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"This again evades the solution since the year 1552 Latin edition of Guliielmus Postellus resides in th e British Museum. Even the volumes of printed rituals of cere monial magic of the Golden Dawn is silent and never even mentions the 231 gates. If the S.Y. is as ancient a s Abraham himself, the good fathers of the Great Lo dge have remained silent for some unknown reason. R.B. Fuller provides the solution on one level of c orrespondence. On page 62 we discussed the tetracty s frequency grid. This showed the underlying order in seemingly random events. The algebraic (B. Fuller's) formula shown as R = N squared -N, divided by 2, where N equals the nu mber of events and R the number of relationships be tween the events. Substituting the number 22 (the number of the Hebre w letters) into our formula we confidently arrive a t the number 231, the mystery number of the gates, and as the S. Y. would say about the number of the ten Sephiroth, not one more or one less, but exactly 231. Thus, the S.Y. explaining the combination of the 22 letters shows the number of communication relation ships between the letters, the sum of which is tetrahedro nal. On a higher level of correspondence, the mystery of the 231 gates requires a brief journey into minera logy. 4. The Crystal Space Groups Crystallography has had a short and concise history . In 1611 J. Kepler published a small pamphlet on h exagonal snow suggesting that the regularity of crystal form is due to the regular geometrical arrangement of s mall building blocks. In 1669 Nicolas Steno published a theorem t hat the angles between corresponding faces in cryst al structure were constant. In 1780, Carangeat invented a device to measure the Steno interfacial angles. In 1784 t he Abbe Havy published an essay on a theory of crystal structure wherein, like Kepler, all crystals are composed of small polyhedral units, the unit for each mineral having a characteristic shape. Later in 1850, M.A. Bravais discovered that 14 types of regular geometrical patterns result fro m arranging identical points in space, so that any point is repeated at regular intervals along each row of the pattern. These 14 geometric arrangements of unit cells call ed Bravais lattices as shown in Plat No.. When arranged into groups of symmetry, there are 32 crystal classes and the Law of Seven works into th ese 32 classes creating seven crystal systems or general c rystal groups into which all 32 classes have common elements. Plat No. shows examples of the most common crystal form of each system."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"In the late 19th century, in three different locati ons, three different persons independently develope d the geometrical concept of the number of different kinds of arrange ment possible in crystal systems. The first was Leonhard Sohncke (b. 1842) a German p rofessor of physics who combined the fourteen possi ble space lattice types with the symmetry inherent in the 32 crystal classes and added to it translational motio n (screw axis and glide planes). He discovered the concept of space g roups. Each of the 32 crystal classes is characteri zed by symmetry elements that pass through a single point, thus they are now called point groups. However, if each point group is moved through space by transnational motio n, the result is a geometrical array of scaffolding with symmetry elements grouped into what is called space groups. In 1879 (the beginning of the reign of St. Michael) Sohncke published the first crystallographic work identifying a total of 65 such space groups. About the same time, E. S. Fedoron a Russian crystallographer and miner alogist published in 1885 the results of his efforts. Likew ise, in 1891 Arthur Schoenflies a German mathematic ian published the result of his research and in 1894 Wi lliam Barlow an English amateur published his effor ts. Although the last three publications arrived independently a nd from different scientific approaches, they arriv ed at the same result, to the 65 space groups proposed by Sohncke could be added an additional 165 for a total of 230 . Thus, the combination of the 32 crystal classes wit h the 14 Bravais space lattices produces 230 possib le distributions that atoms can assume in minerals. While, the numbe r of combinations of atoms and molecules is infinit e, the number of their arrangements in three-dimensional s pace or form is limited to 230. In conclusion, modern era classification of crystal line structure is as follows: CRYSTAL SYSTEM # CRYSTAL CLASSES # SPACE GROUPS 1. Triclinic 2 2 2. Monoclinic 3 13 3. Orthorhombic 3 59 4. Tetragonal 7 68 5. Hexagonal (3-fold) 5 25 6. Hexagonal (6-fold) 7 27 7. Isometric 5 36 Total= 32 230 5. The Mineral Kingdom There is an occult correspondence between the 231 g ates and the 230 crystal space groups. To develop t his we return to page 55 where in the seven conditions of life or rounds are briefly described. Here we see that after the 1 st - 2nd - 3rd elementary kingdoms, the conditions of life proceed s through the mineral kingdom, plant kingdom, anima l kingdom and lastly, the human kingdom. It is important to r ealize from this evolution that we as humans are in the present mineral kingdom, and not the human kingdom, which i s the last of the evolutionary kingdom. Each of the seven conditions of consciousness (manvantara) passes thr ough 49 conditions of life (rounds) for a total of 7 x 49 or 343. To date, we have passed through a total of 171 cond itions of form (globes). When evolution proceeds th rough the remaining 172 conditions of form, mankind will pass into the next higher Jupiter condition consciousne ss wherein humanity will have evolved into the plant kingdom. In this future condition, a portion of humanity wil l have angelic bodies and will regulate the plant kingdom as is no w accomplished by the present angelic community of spirits ruling from Lower Devachan. Now, what does this mean that humanity is in the mi neral kingdom and not in the human kingdom? Steiner explains the mystery in the lecture series entitled, The Apo calypse of St. John. \"In the earlier period of the Earth's evolution, th e mineral kingdom existed in the condition of the ( three) elementary kingdoms...It is as if these elementary kingdoms ha d condensed and disappeared, so to speak, into our world. They precede our mineral kingdoms.\" Thus, in one sense fine atomic and sub-atomic subst ance of the three elementary kingdoms have passed i nto and created the mineral kingdom. In another sense, man' s ego-consciousness is at the level of the mineral kingdom and has not yet evolved into the higher kingdoms. Again , \"What can man comprehend today? He can only underst and the mineral kingdom. As soon as he comes to the plant kingdom, he no longer understands it. The mineral k ingdom he can understand. From the forces of the mi neral kingdom he can construct houses, machines, and so o n. When he comes to learn in the same way to observ e what the forces are in a plant which make it grow tall, only this will lift him with his consciousness into the plant kingdom. In time will come when he will take planthood into his own being, just as he now has the mineral kingd om within him. And just as he builds houses of minerals, just as he now uses the forces of the mineral kingdom, so he will in the future, out of the familiar forces of the plant kingdom, produce plant forces and still higher thi ngs in the"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"laboratory, without resorting to seeds...Man will t hen have risen into the plant kingdom when he under stands the plant nature as he now understands the mineral... Elsewhere, Steiner says, \"The mineral kingdom came into existence during the fourth round. Everything that man does today, the entire world of industry, is the transformation of the min eral kingdom...The whole mineral kingdom will be tr ansformed by man. Here man will work right into the molecules and atoms. Eventually there will be no single atom on earth that has not been worked upon by man. At the end of the fourth round he will have transformed the enti re mineral kingdom. From the fifth round onwards man will do t he same with the plant kingdom.\" The key here is that \"at the present time man is pe rfected alone in the mineral kingdom\". When these w ords were first spoken in 1908, the meaning was less then obv ious. Now, at the end of the 20th century, its mean ing is crystal clear. Man is building skyscrapers; rubies and emer alds are synthesized in the laboratory; man made ce ramics are approaching the perfect super-conductors and silico n valley is the Tower of Babel of synthetic quartz. In fact, we now see the rudiments of the beginning of our consc iousness in the plant world with DNA genetically en gineered bacteria. How was this perfection in the mineral world accomp lished? It was accomplished by the identity of the 230 crystal space groups, beginning in 1879, the commencement o f the Michael Age. Each possible crystal form of th e mineral world has now been identified and catalogued by our rational mathematical mind descended from Abraham. With identification comes control of synthesis and repro duction of the mineral elements. This event of perfection in the mineral kingdom was foreseen by the wisdom of the sun oracle, Malek-Za dek and prophetically given to Abraham in the 231 gates of the S.Y. When Abraham speaks of the 231 gates as th e foundation of all things, he speaks of the foundati on of all things in the present mineral kingdom. Th e 231 gates are the 230 crystal space groups. The foundation of all things in the mineral kingdom - minus one. The rem aining task of our mineralogist's is to identify that last 231s t space group, not yet discovered. This task is similar to the Greek mathematician who discovered the Archimedean semi-regular solids, in cluding the cuboctohedron, but never realized the spiritual sig nificance of this discovery until two millennium la ter, R.B. Fuller identifies the cuboctahedron as the \"divine\" equili brium form of the cosmos. Finally, R. Steiner's symbol for the three remainin g kingdoms is the cross. The mineral kingdom is exc luded because man already controls this kingdom. The lower beam c orresponds to the plant kingdom, wit its roots buri ed in the earth and its stem directed upwards. The middle bea m corresponds to the animal kingdom, which is a pla nt turned halfway and carrying its spine horizontally to the earth. The upper beam corresponds to man which is t he plant turned upside down. In the plant the sex organs are turned upward in the blossom. In man, the sex orga ns are turned away and the head is directed upwards. This occult symbol of the cross shows us how man in his evoluti on must pass through the remaining three kingdoms of nature . 6. Here is Wisdom \"Here is Wisdom\", he that can name, number and meas ure all things under the sun is the hierophant that is the measure of all things. As Dr. Steiner said, \"Just as we place images, Imaginations, before the soul, so on still higher levels the inner power of numbers is placed before human beings. Human beings have to le arn to experience the inner proportions of numbers as spiritual music. Of particular importance, however, is the pr oportion 1:3:7:12. If you understand the proportion of these numbers as a musical relationship in the sense that one number oscillates three times in a given perio d, another seven, and still another one twelve, then you will find expressed in these numbers the relationship in spiritual music of the 'I', astral body, etheric body and physical body.\" This book has been an exercise in understanding and experiencing the inner power of the laws of the nu mbers 1-3-7- 12, numbers which even Steiner says are the most im portant. This last secret is expressed in this rela tionship: I (ego/self) 1 Monadic self Astral Body 3 Thought and Word Etheric body 7 Feeling and Imagination Physical body 12 Will and Action In addition, our Anonymous author of the MEDITATION S concurs with this conclusion and says, \"For twelve is the number of modalities of the will and its action; seven is the number of basic modal ities of feeling and imagination; three is the numerical law of thou ght and word; and one, lastly, is the number of the self who thinks, feels and wills. The monad therefore reveal s itself through the Trinity underlying thought and word, through the septenary underlying feeling and imagination an d through the duodenary underlying will and action. \"The sum of the numbers of reality-1,3,7 and 12-is twenty-two (and not 23, since One transcends the ot her and includes them itself). This is the true reason for the fact that there are 22 Major Arcana of the Taro t, and no more or"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"no less...The sacred name JHVH comprises four membe rs or numbers: 1,3,7 and 12...Twenty two is four an d four is three revealing one.\" The Holy Books of the 22 numbers are the Chaldean B ook of Numbers, the Sepher Yetzirah, the Apocalypse of St. John and the Tarot cards of the Major Arcana, which follow Hermeticism thru respectively, the second, third, fourth and fifth cultural epochs. Each is an incarnation o f the earlier, but on a higher level. Each is the c ollection of thoughts of living angels connected in a living tra dition and community of spirits from age to age. "}]
