The people of the town were amazed and a large crowd gathered around to witness his vigil. For three days and nights Kif remained in the well. To his surprise he found that he could see the stars of the heavens in the day time as well as at night. And so he became dumb - struck with awe. When he was hauled up, Kif was summoned to the tent of the Caliph, who wished to learn what Kif had experienced down the well, and offered a mea l and wine. Refusing these, Kif requested a simple bowl of dates and a glass of goats milk which he consumed with relish. He was then brought before the Caliph who asked him: \"What did the Goddess reveal of Herself to you, my son?\" Kif stared at him for a moment before replying. \"In seeking the light, we are all blinded by it.\" He said. \"It is what is beyond the light that should concern us: for the light shines out of a darkness which cradles us continuously. \"The Light is the Way, but the darkness is t he beginning and the end.\" \"And how may we know the Goddess? How is it that we may come to know the unknowable?\" The Caliph further pursued. \"By living simple lives.\" Kif replied. \"And by learning that one must descend into the darkness in order to see beyond the light.\" The Nineteenth Gate (Kether of Yesod) A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A General Introduction to the Qabalah QBL, or Qabalah, is a word signifying a verbal tradition of secret religious lore, and translates literally from the Hebrew as 'from mouth to ear'. Acco rding to the Qabalistic tradition, God created the Universal Schema through spoken utterances and commands. The Ten Spheres upon the Tree of Life glyph are the divine Sephiroth [more properly 'Sephiroth Belimah' - 'Voices from Nothing'] which symbolically represent the Decad of Creation. The decimal unit was taken by the originators of the Qabalah, who saw in the number ten a measure of perfection, to represent the trinity of the god - head working through the Seven Days of Creation. The Hebrew letters Yod, Heh and Vau are the letters of the name IHVH which compose this pre - Christian trinity. The number three has always been linked to the concept of the god - head, mainly due to its links to the concept of Eternity. The Creators three - fold aspect is 'He that h as always existed', 'He that exists' and 'He that shall endure for ever'. The idea of an infinite and immortal God, who reveals himself in a Universe he has fashioned from the substance of His own being represents a paradox. The Qabalist is human, and th erefore limited by his own mortality. He therefore finds himself having to deal with the problem of having to relate to an immortal Creator dealing with his creation, and also the paradox of his own place in Eternity"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"as a being limited within a four dimens ional perceptual frame reference. As a starting point, and even this may take several lifetimes to master, the Qabalah attempts to arrive at an understanding of one single aspect of the Creator through the study of numerology and meditation upon the sacre d hieroglyphs of the Hebrew alphabet. Because the system of the Qabalah represents the esoteric side of the Judaic religious lore it contains many keys which unlock texts contained in the Old testament. In the Hebrew tongue, letters of the alphabet stand d ouble duty as numbers. For example, the letter Aleph may also be written for the character representing number One. Every word and phrase therefore has a numerological value. The Hebrew phrase 'IHVH AChD' [\"The Eternal reveals himself through unity\"] add s to the number 39. There are Thirty Nine separate works in the Hebrew canonical works which comprise the Old Testament. Also, the number of Hebrew letters in the titles of the Ten Sephiroth total thirty nine in all. Thus can the Qabalistic significance of the phrase IHVH AChD be realised. Other codes contained in the text of the Old Testament include a series of three verses which run concurrently in the Book of Exodus; each comprised of seventy two letters. These are Exodus 14: 19, 20 and 21.

According to Aleister Crowley in his \"Book of Thoth\", these names may be arrived at from the tri - syllable combinations in the same fashion that crossword solutions may be gleaned through paying attention to the known letters of the word yo u are seeking and filling in the blanks. The above mentioned list of names constitute the hierarchy of powers known as the Angels of the Schemahamphorash [Divided Name\"]. All of this will be studied by advanced Qabalists, but the beginner will have to beg in from basics such as the Hebrew alphabet and the Sephiroth. I would advise the newcomer to disregard the list of the Schemahamphorash to be found in Regardie's 'Golden Dawn' as this work contains elementary mistakes in the rendering of six of the angel ic names obtained from the columns of Exodus 14, verses 19, 20 and 21. The Qabalah: It's Origin & Development The exact date of the origin of the esoteric system known as the Qabalah is a scholarly mystery. Ancient tradition recounts that the secret do ctrine enshrined in Qabalistic lore was communicated directly to Adam by the Archangel Ratziel, who passed it on to successive generation by word of mouth. By a similar method the Qabalah has survived the millennia and has only in recent times been committ ed to writing in a somewhat incomplete format - for it has always been an oral tradition surviving exclusively in the Rabbinical caste. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Whatever the true origins of Qabalistic philosophy, its original foundations are certainly contemporary with Jehovah [I HVH] worship amongst the Semitic peoples. Certainly these foundations existed long enough before the Pentateuch [first five books of the Old Testament] for them to be incorporated into the essence of this collection of writings which was written circa 1500 BC [Era Vulgaris]. The canonical works of the Hebrew Testament are remarkable in that they are strictly exoteric in nature; dealing with worldly and materialistic philosophies, laws and codes of moral behaviour. The esoteric side of Judaism was, in the main, left open to the interpretation of qualified teachers [Rabbi's] whose meditations upon the 'letters of the law' incorporated Qabalistic doctrine in order to gain an understanding of the divine Cosmogony. In this way the Qabalah evolved, for now and t hen great teachers of penetrating insight would discern fresh and deeper insights into the lore. Each building upon the successes of those who had passed that way before him. Wynn Westcott in \"The Magical Mason\" [Ed. R.A. Gilbert] notes the similarity in the development of the Qabalah alongside Old Testament sources to the relationship between the esoteric Upanishads of the Hindus and the more exoteric Brahmana texts. In both cases the 'secret' knowledge was kept strictly apart from the profane texts as t his knowledge was for the eyes of only the most worthy. For many centuries the Qabalistic doctrines continued to be passed on by word of mouth and doubtless varied and evolved by the minds through which it filtered. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The first Qabalistic work dealing with the Sephiroth and the letters of the Hebrew alphabet to be published was the Sepher Yetzirah - The Book of Formation which surfaced circa 22 A.D - composed of a synthesis of partially complete ancient versions. This work is a philosophical commentary upon the Creation - drawing a parallel between the works of creation [origin of the Earth, Sun, Planets, Elements, etc] - and the twenty two letters of the Hebrew alphabet and their combinations which the Source employed in the act of creation. To these twenty two letters are added the ten Sephiroth, thus revealing the Thirty two Paths of Wisdom. The Sepher Yetzirah was strongly influenced by Judaic Merkabah mysticism which employed meditative techniques to induce trance vision and the apparent experience of as tral projection. Through Merkabah techniques the practitioner would rise through the planes in his astral form, where he would perceive the Almighty seated on his Throne or Chariot [Merkabah]. This journey would be perilous in the extreme for deadly being s were held to guard the gateways to the astral planes in order to prevent unworthy souls from spiritual ascent. Only the knowledge of the correct keys and the magical names of power could ensure the safe passage of the Soul during Merkabah projection: a p hilosophy borrowed by the later Gnostics, which underpins their beliefs in the souls confrontation of the Archons at the gates of the seven planes during the after - life. Around 200 AD two distinct schools of Qabalistic thought had evolved. That is, the un derstanding of the idea of God arrived at by two separate areas of concentration - the study of the numbers [or Sephiroth] and the study of the 22 letters [the Schema]."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" The second Qabalistic treatise to be made public was the Sepher Zohar [the Book of Spl endour], published circa 1290 AD by Rabbi Moses de Leon of Guadalajara, Spain. Like the Sepher Yetzirah, this work is a synthesis of separate treatises written by numerous Rabbis throughout the ages. According to the lore of the tradition the literary bac k - bone of the Sepher Zohar was originally committed to writing by Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, who completed this task around 160 AD after being driven into living in exile in a cave by Lucius Aurelius Verus the co - regent with the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. By the time this work came to be published by Rabbi Moses de Leon it had been added to by other hands, and the main task of its editor lay in synthesising the extant literature into a coherent format. From this time onwards, the main body of M erkabah inspired Qabalistic doctrine fell into the domain of medieval magick and ceremonial occultism. Manuscript copies of the Sepher Zohar were in general circulation until three official codices of the work appeared in the late sixteenth and early seven teenth centuries. These were the Mantua codex of 1558, the Cremona Codex of 1590 and the Lublin codex of 1628 which were printed in the Hebrew language. The philosophies imbedded in both the Sepher Yetzirah and the Zohar imply a belief in the hierarchical arrangement of the Universe of which Man is held to be a microcosm. This provided Qabalistic scholars with a ladder of mystical ascent which could be 'climbed' by anyone who correctly employed the time held magical Names of Power in their meditations upon the divine being.

When the Fifty meet the Twenty Two, the Seventy Two angels of the Schemhamphorasch [held to be the leaves upon the Tree of Life] may be understood by the Wise. . The Rosicrucian 'Cabalah' Another thread in the tapestry of arcane wisdom which many authorities fail to dist inguish from the Qabalah is the founding of the Cabala - the Sufi oriented semantic system - which has influenced many prominent philosophers and teachers and which links into the history of the Spanish Qabalah. This system may be thought of as being sim ilar in nature to Zen in its teaching methods. It is rooted in the Language of the Birds [the 'green language' which has infiltrated the western alchemic tradition] and examples of the use of the methods of the 'Cabala' which writers upon the Qabalah have employed may be found in the works of Kenneth Grant and the French alchemist writing under the name of Fulcanelli. The Arabic word WIRD, signifying the 'developmental exercise' practices of the Sufis has often been used by the Sufi mystical poets as WaRD, meaning Rose."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" The Arabic root SLB, meaning to 'extract the marrow' was also often employed alongside the former as SLB WIRD, translating as \"to obtain the core essence of the exercise\". Another rendering of the root SLB also translates as 'Cross'. Accor ding to Idries Shah writing in his 'History of the Sufi's', it is this misunderstanding of Arabic grammar that has confused those standing outside, and not infrequently inside, the Rosicrucian tradition. And he has a case. It is certainly true that the Re naissance, and the ensuing Age of Enlightenment would not have been possible but for the spread of the Arab wisdom through Moorish Spain into Europe from the late eighth century onwards. The Arabs had preserved the classics of the ancient world and the al gebra of ancient India. After the Crusades precious works thought lost to western civilisation suddenly became available. The Age of the Crusades was only cooling when the Renaissance flowered. Crusading in the Middle East against the infidel, and the int ernal European Crusades against such heresies as the Cathar/Albigensian movement, had been launched to combat the expansion of the intellectual arena of the Islamic world. This latter, due mainly to the Moorish occupation of South Western Spain, had foster ed an intellectual climate that made the popularisation and printing of the Sepher Zohar in the Thirteenth century possible.

Even taken allegorically this mythos fails to satisfy, and appears shallow in the extreme. Modern and supposedly auth oritative books published upon the subject of Rosicrucianism and the hermetic Qabalah fail to raise the issue of a Sufi heritage. Many of the authors, whilst fully aware of the existence of the groups of philosophers claimed over the ages as Rosicrucian in itiates, seem unable or unwilling to provide supporting evidence for a 'strong theory' focus on the Arabian source of the concept of Rosicrucianism. Both Johann Duns Scotus and his protégé Thomas Aquinas were reputed to be able to sight read the prophet i n his native tongue. Ramon Lull, claimed by many 'authorities' as a true Rosicrucian and whose philosophical efforts brought us the 'Rosicrucian Qabalah' [or 'Spanish Qabalah'] was bi lingual in the Islamic vernacular - he was stoned to death in the Holy L and trying to convert the natives to Christianity. In the spirit of the above, one other name stands out in the history of philosophy as a likely catalyst to the tradition that has come down to us as the rather anaemic, 'fake', 'Rosicrucianism' of the kin d practiced by those uncritical enough to tow the 'Golden Dawn' line without question. That name is Michael Scott, the utopian thinker and Court Philosopher to Emperor Frederick II of Sicily - an island with a history of Moorish occupation and religious an d"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"architectural culture, where he no doubt came under the influence of schools of Sufi thought. Scott had a public reputation for performing miracles that would put any self respecting wonder working Rabbi to shame, and is also reported to have been adept at inducing visions by a combination of manipulation of light and suggestion; a phenomenon strongly associated with Sufi adepts. It is possible that his familiarity with, and translation of, the texts of Arabian medicine and philosophy inspired much specu lation upon his alleged alchemical prowess, and also concerning his later influence upon tales alluded to in later Rosicrucian texts. He was even mentioned by Dante - himself a student of the Spanish Saracen derived language of Provence, the chosen idiom o f the authors of the Troubadour Courtly Romances - in his Divine Comedy (Inferno, Canto XX, lines 115 - 117). The later published allegorical tales of the Rosicrucians, especially the legends concerning events in the life of Christian Rosencranz, evidently had some foundation in the myths circulated amongst the common people of the Middle Ages concerning the teachings and adventures of the great philosophers of the era. The Qabalah of Fifty Gates The Qabalistic Tree of Life glyph is composed of ten Seph iroth, twenty two Paths [which are in effect the combined influences of the Sephiroth] and fifty Gates which constitute states of mind generated by our experience of the Sephiroth and the twenty two Paths. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The traditional Qabalistic interpretation of the 'Four Hundred Desirable Worlds' is challenged by the model of the Tree of Life implied by the Thelemic system of the Fifty gates. In the traditional system, a microcosmic blueprint of the ten Sephiroth is contained in each individual Sephirah throughout ea ch of the Four Qabalistic Worlds - yielding Four Hundred possible worlds. In the system of the Fifty Gates, each Sephirah of the Tree is thought to contain only the blueprint of the Sephiroth preceding it upon the Tree plus the potentia of it's own mystic al experience. Chesed, the fourth Sephirah, is therefore thought to contain the 'genetic blueprint' of Kether, Chokmah and Binah - which precede it - plus the potentia of the divine force of Love; it's own qualitative experience: four gates in all. Usin g this new system, fifty such gates separate the noumenal world of the lowest gate in Malkuth, from the Supernal Triad of Kether, Chokmah, Binah. Daath, the void created by Malkuth during 'The Fall' alluded to in Genesis representing the Fiftieth of the Ga tes. The system of the Qabalah of Fifty Gates may initially perhaps best be approached as an organised exploration of the psychological 'mind - sets' and webs of psycho - sexual dynamics which underlie our belief systems - the raggle taggle amalgams of workin g hypotheses which colour our outlook upon the world we interface with day by day. As one advances through the gates, sometimes \"in turn\" at other times \"at once\", the aspirant will sublimate the prima - materia of the lower - ego personality and advance thro ugh"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"the higher gates to confront psycho - spiritual and sexo - spiritual personal dynamics. Next, techniques may be harnessed by Initiates working within the sphere of the 'mid heaven gates' to catapult the throne of the lower consciousness through the veil o f Paroketh which clouds access to the experience of the Holy Guardian Angel in Tiphareth and the Cubic Stone of the Six Gates. These technique of involves the blending of the aspirations of the personality towards immortality and the flow of the potential energies which vitalise the individuals drive towards survival. These 'higher' potential energies are considered by many modern initiates to be focused by the ‘Over - Self’ entity - portrayed by the metaphor of the Holy Guardian Angel after the publication of Samuel Liddell Mather’s ‘Magic of Abramelin the Mage’ in the Golden Dawn tradition - from the realm of Eternity [the non dimensional realm of the Ain Soph, above the Tree of Life]. In a sense, this requires a blending of the subconscious and super - co nscious [ego], subjectivity and objectivity. The Book of the Law states \"There is division hither homewards\": it is this 'division' that provides the catalyst for change and evolutionary development. Gurdjieff talked of a 'Third World' and a 'Third Force' lying between reality and perception; J.G. Bennett discusses ‘Hazard’; Austin Osman Spare talks of an 'in - between' reality and Jan Fries of a 'Siedways'. Similarly, the 50 Gates are purely experiential. Perception of their qualities is reliant upon the innate mental structures which underpin the individual’s mental representations upon which his or her world view is constructed. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" The experience of the Fifty Gates is similar to the art of pathworking, but momentary and hauntingly elusive. One steps in to and through each of the Gates and receives a quanta of enlightenment akin to the spark burning in the lamp of the Hermit of the Tarot, which lights his surroundings. Given that each of us is a Microcosm of a greater, but divided whole, we can only hope to know the Creator through the Creation: within the sphere of influence represented by Tiphareth upon the Tree of Life, composed of the six potentials of the gates of that matrix which marry the Macrocosm to the Microcosm. According to the Neo - Platonic model of the Qabalah as evinced by Frances Yates, Man is regarded as a microcosm of the whole of the Creation. And the Creation itself, a mere microcosm of the Creator. Even a microcosm of the Microcosm (a Nanocosm) may, according to the logic underlying the modus operandi of Qabalistic lore, contain the key to 'knowing' the Macrocosm. For the identity of the Macrocosm is held to reveal itself through the processes of Creation which have remained consistent since the first three minutes after the Big Bang event. The system of the Fifty Gates provides a missing link between Qabalistic Magic and Mysticism for it posits the following: The processes involved in the creation of a Nanocosm in relation to a microcosm must be consistent with the process involved in the creation of a Microcosm in relation to a Macrocosm."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Therefore the Nanocosm may know the Macrocosm by observing it's interactive relationship with, and it's origins in the Microcosm. 'Working the Fifty Gates' is therefore a process of Self realisation and empowerment through guided visionary self - confrontation and self - observation requiring great impartiality of prejudice. At the commencement, it is a system which attempts to help the aspirant identify the elements of his or her own psychological make - up which constitute the contact points between the Self and the Source. Contact points which may be 'worked on' and fine tuned in order to better 'walk the paths' between the Sephiroth. Indeed, one must be intimately familiar with the virtues and vices o f Sephiroth of the Qabalistic Tree in order to pass through the 50 Gates. But one must understand their significance as portals for transformation as, similarly, one must understand that the paths of the Tree are not always pathways that are mentally wal ked. More often, these paths represent states of being. In a similar way, the experiences of the 50 Gates represent processes of ‘becoming’. If my treatment of some of the experiences associated with the Qabalah of 50 gates appears sometimes flippant, then sometimes overly serious, be warned that this is deliberate. In two instances I have reworked traditional Sufi parables to suit the instance, and I am indebted to Idries Shah for his rendering of these in his excellent work ‘Caravan of Dreams’.

The state of self awareness experienced by the lower ego personality peculiar to orgasm generated by sex - fantasy rites.

The Fourth Gate (Netzach of M alkuth) The ideology of surrender within the context of sexual union.

The fourth gate's essence is the affirmation of the 'Will to survive' expres sed through sexual activity. The Fifth gate (Tiphareth of Malkuth) The evolutionary aspiration expressed in the joy of orgasm and sexual bonding.

Throughout the m orning crowds gathered to see the hypnotist convince men that they were donkeys, and women that they were tigers. Stupid men came to be cured of their imbecility, those with stutters were made able to speak clearly, the lame walked and the nearly blind wer e restored to sight. As the crowds gathered, Coconut sold more figs in one morning than he might reasonably expect to do in a week or more. Counting his takings with deep satisfaction, Coconut decided that he would make a habit of following the magician fr om town to town.

After placing the fig - seller in a deep hypnotic trance the Master commanded him to be wise in all dealings, discerning in all purchases, fair with all people and chee rful against all adversity. Then he put his mouth to Coconuts ear and, in a whisper, commanded him to take all of his powers from him.

And you will not even need to work your stall, for the Master will provide willing servants to do the work of the donkey.\" \"And what will I do?\" Coconut hesitantly enquired. \"You will do the work of the Master entertaining the masses and curing the sick,\" the merchant replied. \"You now have the power to do an ything you so desire.

She came here to meditate at morning and twilight every day, seeking consolation in the tranquillity of the gar den's beauty. Every day she would throw seed for the birds to feed upon.

This meant that each of the priestesses of pleasure were able to choose husbands wisely once they had fulfilled their obligations to their divine office. Many of the girls married princes or merchants once they had spent the night with a worshipper. Sometimes, married women chose to return to service within the chamber in order to gain the ri ght to choose a second or third husband. The vestal virgins of the temple were often only symbolically virginal. Both worship and service within the chamber of harlots were regarded by the people of the Citadel as rites of rebirth and spiritual renewal. W hen Kilo slipped quietly into the temple of pleasure, the entire population held it's breath for this was an occasion of great expectation. The bride which Kilo would choose to 'marry' for the night would gain great respect and influence, and she would be greatly prized as a wife by any man whom she chose to take as a husband after laying down with the High Priest. In the morning, when the wedding night was over and the warm aura of conjugal bliss settled over the waking High Priest and his chosen bride, t hey fell into conversation together.

If I had slept for one night with anyone other than you the High Priest, then I think that I would indeed have returned to marry him.\" \"Then what will you do?\" Kilo said. \"I will remain as I am.\" Marah replied. \"I married you last night, and so do no t technically need to seek a husband in the world. Having married, I am already a free woman and the fee I have earned from my service to you last night will enable me to enjoy my life in the world.

This time it was Lassid, the Mystic: \"And what spiritual exercises were you pursuing to lead you to this enlightenment?\" he enquired. \"I was w orking on a new approach,\" the Purple Sage declared. \"You see, the traditional systems have failed us thus far; for they have not allowed us to even begin to ask the right questions.\" At these words Lassid let out a roar and departed from the chamber tak ing his followers with him.

But the crowd continued to question, heckle and dese rt him as they grew angry at his answers and as time passed the Purple Sage grew tired of the criticism from the floor and retired to his seat, signalling to all that he would say no more. Those that had remained to hear his revelation then grew angry wit h him in frustration and the crowd rose up as one and threw him out of the meeting hall; mocking him and heaping upon his shoulders the indignity of rejection. Now at that time there was a gateway in the city walls that had never been used in the entire h istory of the citadel. Legend and folk lore had grown up around this gateway. Some said that the Chosen One would pass through it. Some claimed that it could only be opened by the angels. Some stories claimed that the gate led to higher realms, and A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"that th ose who passed through it would never be seen again. It had remained closed since the days of the mighty engineers, students of the Old Magicians who had planned the architecture of the Citadel according to the principles of the celestial harmonies of the Universe. It was to this gate that the mocking assembly led the Purple Sage. Laughing and cajoling him with sarcasm and unkind remarks they challenged him to open the gate. \"If you have truly achieved enlightenment, then you must prove it.\" One of them s aid with a bitter laugh. \"You are fools.\" the Purple Sage said. Stepping forward, he laid his palm flat against the stone face of the gateway and simply pushed and stepped through the portal into the light. He was never seen in the Citadel again. For many centuries after this, every word of the Purple Sage's replies to the Wise Men's questions were analysed, argued over and discussed. New Qabalistic theosophies were interpreted in his words and novel systems of lateral thinking grew up based around the imp lications of his passing through the gate of no return. But every so often, a young novitiate would pass unseen into the temple of Nuit by a secret door and would return to slip surreptitiously out of the citadel by means of the gate through which the Pur ple Sage had passed. And these exits went unnoticed by the many for the servants of the star goddess are few and secrete their wisdom gently from this world in a manner beyond whispers and allusion."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" The Thirty First Gate (Chesed of Netzach) The Bell Far across the desert and through the night they had ridden, these dusty pilgrims, driving their camels hard in pursuit of the new star. Caked in the white sands of the desert basins they paused to honour the rising sun whilst their retinue struggl ed to keep pace. Two days ride ahead lay the Mountains of Madness, beyond which the fabled City of Pyramids dominated the western lands. One of the camel masters pointed and shouted to the mounted pilgrims: \"One hour's journeying hence, and we shall find the oasis which we seek.\" The leader of the white riders grunted, then signalled for the preparations for the adoration of the rising Sun to begin. The travellers dismounted and raised their arms towards the sun. Leaning their heads slightly to the left they intoned: \"Hail unto thee who art Ra in thy rising. Even unto thee who art Ra in thy strength. Who travels over the heavens in thy bark, at this the uprising of the Sun. Tahuti standeth at the helm and Ra Hoor abideth at the prow. Hail unto thee from the abodes of Night!\" A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"By the time they arrived at the oasis the sun was still low in the sky. A team of camels laden with silks for the eastern markets plodded towards them, led by a small group of merchants riding in a sheltered wagon. As the carav an of the star seekers passed by them in single file the camel master raised his closed fist in traditional greeting and, as the last of the merchant's camels departed from the palm rich oasis, the first of the pilgrims arrived there. A solitary figure, c lad in the dark black and purple of the holy man sat watching the approaching caravan from beneath one of the leafy palms. When the pilgrims had quenched their thirst from the spring waters of the oasis and their servants had erected the tents to protect t heir number from the rage of the desert sunlight, the leader of the star seekers sent his manservant to the holy man, inviting him to the hospitality of his tent for refreshment and counsel. Kif accepted, and broke his fast in the tent of the eastern boun d caravan with a meal of fruit and dates. \"Where are you bound, holy man?\" the leader enquired, once they had finished their simple meal. \"I am bound for the City of Pyramids,\" Kif replied. \"Then you are indeed walking a winding path,\" the leader comment ed. \"We have roamed this desert for generations, and sometimes visit there. Some tales say that every man and woman, in some lifetime or another must pass through its gate.\" \"It is given to me to have that privilege,\" Kif stated. \"I would be grateful to y ou if you would share your knowledge of the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"pathway which leads there and also tell me of your own quest.\" It was the son of the pilgrim star seeker who replied to Kif, whilst refilling his guest's goblet with wine: \"Who treads the path of the desert fox is a brother to us. Our camel master will set you upon the best path when you depart. But let me speak to you of our mission in the desert. \"We are musicians. That is our tradition. Our fathers and mothers sang with the desert winds at the raising of the pyramid city. We visit and sing with the running waters of the mighty rivers beyond the white sands: old songs, older than the songs we sing of the valleys and the plains. Our sagas tell the stories of the raising of the mountains; of the retreat of the gr eat sea; of the coming of the sunlight and of the birth of the day. \"Once, every few generations, the heavens move and we sing with the stars and the Moon. We sing with the old stars, but sometimes there are new songs to learn and new stars to follow that we may catch their melody.\" \"You speak of the new star that rushes towards Jupiter?\" Kif enquired. \"We do.\" The pilgrim leader answered, signalling for his son to refill his goblet. \"It will collide with that mighty orb and be no more this very night.\" \"But it will sing a song in it's passing that will be remembered as the overture of a new Aeon,\" the leader's son continued. \"We seek the place where our ancestors sang the song of the first star of the morning: the star of the A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"goddess. She will hear the mighty song and whisper it in our ears whilst we lie in her secret place.\" \"The song of the shooting star will ring like a bell throughout the heavens,\" his father mused. \"May your songs continue to bring life to the world,\" Kif said with ritual solemni ty. \"I will hear your song in my dreams and pray to the gods of the heavens for the new awakening of the world.\" \"Now tell us if you have any need of anything that we may have to make your journey an easy one,\" the pilgrim leader said expansively. \"You wi ll find that your arrival within the City of Pyramids may not be the end of your journey. For there are many cities within the great city. Each is a perfect representation of itself and only after many adventures there can a man truly tell one from another and come at last to the true City of Pyramids on the shore of the Great Sea.\" Kif tried to refuse the hospitality of the camp, but fresh stores of fruit, wine and bread were presented to him in a pack to ease his journey beyond the mountains. The camel m aster gave him directions and Kif bade farewell to the caravan with blessings and prayers of good fortune. \"Before you go, let me give you these tokens and words of advice.\" The pilgrim leader said in parting. \"Here is a hawk feather, and also the feather of the peacock. They will serve as amulets of protection upon the path which you must tread, and also as keys to present to guardians who may question your right tread the path which we have set you upon. Present them to any soul who questions you and you will pass safely for they will know that the Watchers have"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"sent you. But you may have to give one up to a guardian, somewhere along the way. \"Remember there may be guides like ourselves, and guardians too upon the path ahead: but no denizen of the desert is truly as he or she appears. Follow your shadow from here on and you will come to the winding pathway that must be climbed over the mountain range. Your shadow will then be behind you, until you come to the city where no shadows are cast.\" \"Farewell,\" Kif replied. \"I will listen for your songs upon the desert wind from those very mountains.\" \"And take this song in your heart, as you pass from us,\" the pilgrim father said. He then began to hum a melody which his fellows took up in chorus as the holy man began his trek into the desert, And that same melody was upon his lips at one time or another during every day that followed. The Thirty Second Gate (Binah of Netzach) Having climbed the winding path up the mountain range, Kif reached the summit and paused to regain his breath and refresh himself with a drink from his flask of wine. An old tree stood a little way down the descending slope ahead and Kif sat beneath it, his back to the wood. His journey from the oasis had passed without incident. Once he thought that he was being watched by unseen eyes, but he had passed onwards through the mighty sand dunes looking neither to the right nor the left; fixing his gaze A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"upon the Hawk and Peacock feathers which he held before him. As he had approached the r ising mountain range, leaving the desert sands behind him Kif thought that he heard voices calling his name. But he did not look back. Instead he fixed his attention firmly upon the song of the desert dwellers who sought after the song of the stars. Their parting melody was burned into his mind, having remained with him in a memory of hypnotic intensity since his journey from the oasis. As he had climbed the winding pathway, the holy man caught the dull glimmer of ores of precious metals and the glint of gemstones only an arms reach from the rising natural stairwell. A treasure fit for a King might be bought for only a handful of these raw jewels, but Kif maintained his steady progress upwards. Whilst he rested the light began to fade in the West, and the stars blinked and twinkled in the skies above. A carpet of light cloud lay a hundred feet beneath the Holy Man's feet, illuminated by the faint light of a rising crescent moon to the south. Kif sighed at the beauty of the still night and gently fell into a sleep. When he awoke the heavens were bright with starlight. The Moon had arisen and was majestically creeping westward, but the lights surrounding the planet Jupiter directly above were spectacular. A rainbow haze lay around the planet and Kif thought s were of the song which was now being sung by the star seekers. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"As his eyes adjusted to their surroundings Kif became aware of a soft voice in his ear. It seemed to him that it was a deep female voice coming to him from far away and yet it spoke in a whi sper. Although he was not afraid, the Sufi clutched the Hawk and Peacock feathers tightly before him. \"Do not be stirred to fear, gentle wanderer,\" the voice said softly. \"I have sheltered you beneath my boughs in the hours of your slumber and kept you fr om all harm. You may trust me for I recognise the symbols which you bear, and honour their significance.\" \"O honourable Talking Tree,\" Kif addressed the nature spirit. \"I recognise you as a guardian and greet you, with respect, as an equal.\" \"I am impres sed by your keen insight,\" the Talking Tree replied, waving it's barren branches in the night breeze. \"Now answer me two riddles if indeed you are an equal. If so you prove to be, you may pass unharmed but not unchanged.\" \"What is the test?\" Kif demanded, recognising the ritual procedure from folk tales of old and adopting the formal etiquette of the occasion. \"I will answer your riddles and meet wit with wit.\" The tree was silent for a moment before answering. A hushed aire of expectancy and drama had cre pt into the night time stillness. Then the nature spirit spoke: \"To gain what you seek, you must lose what you need. To pass by, you must remain where you stand. You must give A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"up all to tread this pathway further. To make space for what you must find, you must be filled up with what I demand.\" Kif stood in silent contemplation for a moment before replying: \"To lose what I need and remain where I stand will involve me standing naked before you.\" He shed his outer robes until he was garbed in only a single light robe and sandals, stepping out from the crumpled silks to leave them where he had stood. \"It says in the Book of the Law that whosoever gives one particle of dust in such an hour shall lose all,\" the Sufi continued. \"I will keep my sandals and under garment as is customary in such riddling matters, as I shall keep my pack. \"But, here,\" he said, offering something very small to the talking tree on the tip of his finger, \"you may have this speck of dust. It is a crumb of the finest incense which I int ended to burn to the Goddess. I now burn it to her in your name.\" Reaching down, Kif took a charcoal block from his kit bag, lit a match and set it alight throwing the speck of incense upon it to smoulder and release it's perfume. \"And to be filled with what you demand,\" the Sufi continued, \"would be to yield completely to the trust which you originally asked of me. So I will offer you one of these feathers as a token of exchange for my freedom to continue upon the path.\" \"You have spoken wisely and wit h great insight,\" the talking tree complimented him. \"You have arrived at my second riddle. For I will ask you to choose which feather you shall"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"present me with. Choose ye well, for it shall be the final challenge.\" \"O noble Lady!\" Kif said worshipfully. \"I recognise you now as the lady Nuit herself. For is it not written in your name ....because of my hair, the Trees of Eternity.... in the Book of the Law. \"I now recognise the feathers which I bear. The feather of the Kestrel Hawk, sacred to Horus your s on, which would bring you comfort; and the feather of the Peacock Hen, sacred in the lands of the East to yourself and the Priestesses of your Temple, which would bring you honour.\" And so Kif held out one of the feathers and placed it upon one of the tal king tree's branches, whereupon leaves miraculously began to appear. \"You have done well to so choose.\" the talking tree said joyfully. In a matter of minutes the branches and boughs were fully obscured by the wealth of leaf growth and, as these rustled i n the night wind it seemed to Kif as if he could see the face of a beautiful woman speaking to him in the shadows and shapes of the leaves as they moved too and fro in the moonlight. \"Depart from here as you are. You shall only face one more challenge befo re you reach the end of your journey. You have shown both discrimination and sensitivity in your approach to the Mysteries, go now with my blessings.\" And so Kif journeyed onwards. (Which Feather would you have given up?)

The dim yellow light of oil lamps could be seen burning from within the shell of the building, and the Sufi s ensed shadows moving to and fro amidst the fallen masonry and decay. Deciding to give the building a wide berth, Kif searched the perimeter of the clearing for a route whereby he might pass unnoticed. The pathways to both right and left were overgrown wit h bracken and the tangle of untamed branches, affording no easy passage. And so the Sufi gathered his wits about him and proceeded cautiously towards the building. As Kif approached the main gateway of the ruin, a small man in Eastern style robes of peaco ck blue silk stepped into his path, his palm open and outstretched. \"You may pass no further, O Seeker.\" the man said gently. \"Few pass this way, but those who do must take hospitality at this shrine and partake in the Ritual of the Serpent before they ma y continue.\" \"It seems that I have little choice but to obey.\" Kif replied, and the Mage led him within. Seated upon the floor within the inner sanctum of the temple, Kif and the eastern sage faced each other over a low table. Coffee and dates were serve d by naked servants, male and female, with flaming red hair and wild green eyes."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"A Hookah pipe was brought to them whilst they drank, eying one another cautiously. Kif guessed that the Temple guardian must be at least a hundred years old. His robes, thoug h clean, looked the worse for wear and the Sufi had to examine them with a keen eye in order to behold the detail of the embroidered crescent moons and stars within their folds. \"The ritual of the serpent must now begin,\" the Mage announced, and two music ians stepped out from a curtain behind him; one holding a flute and one a lyre. A third man then stepped out, holding a basket which he carried to the table and there set it down. The musicians took up a baleful drone of a melody, and the flame - haired ser vants lit a charcoal block and set it glowing within a copper bowl upon the table top. The third man who had entered then reached into the basket and pulled out a snake which Kif recognised to be highly venomous. The man then began singing to the snake an d stroking it until it became stiff and tranquil. Placing it upon the table top before the eastern Mage, the man drew a dagger from his own robes and swiftly chopped off the head of the snake. Kif continued to sit silently, sipping his coffee and carefully watching the proceedings. The servants were busily filling the bowl of the pipe with hashish resin and opium poppies, and when they had finished the snake charmer placed the severed head of the serpent on the top of the pipe's bowl. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"When these preparati ons were completed, the old temple guardian placed the burning charcoal block on top of the snake's head and replaced the cap of the bowl. Handing Kif one of the two mouthpieces attached to the pipe by red tubing the old man began to toke deeply from his o wn; inhaling the smoke deep into his lungs and then breathing out a voluminous cloud of smoke through his nostrils. \"You must take the breath of the serpent seven times before you may pass through this Temple,\" he said ceremoniously. \"You must pause in me ditation after drawing each draught.\" And so Kif took his turn at the pipe, and as he did so the quality of the lighting within the chamber began to diminish in strength and the heady tones of the music swelled in his ears. After he had taken the first b reath from the pipe a vision of his youth presented itself to Kif. He saw himself lying in the arms of a beautiful maiden whom he had loved as a young man. The bed they lay upon was adorned with leopard skins, and fabulous silks hung from the roof of the r oom in which they lay tangled in each others limbs. The picture in Kif's mind then raced on to some future time when he sat at evening meal with this same woman and also three children she had bore him. The Sufi's mind reeled. This was not his own wife an d family, merely a picture of what might have been or what might yet come to pass should he turn back from his quest. \"Return to me, my love,\" the woman's voice seemed to whisper in his ear. \"Your own wife has taken another husband, and I am still young e nough to bear you children.\" "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"\"You may lay down the pipe and return whence you came in safety,\" the Sage's voice brought Kif out of his reverie, and he shook his head to signal his determination to continue. Taking a second draught from the pipe, Kif fou nd his mind wandering again. This time he beheld himself returning from the desert to his home city with rare herbs and roots to heal the sick and infirm. The assembled citizens cheered his return at the city gate, and the faces of the sick and dying were ecstatic with joyful expectancy. \"Return to us, Kif,\" their voices pleaded. \"Your new found wisdom will improve our sciences and medicine. You will be worshipped amongst us so that your name will not fade from memory for two thousand years or more.\" And K if once more opened his eyes and shook his head at the elderly Mage. Once more, Kif drew the smoke from the pipe into his lungs and closed his eyes. A vision of himself at the head of a victorious army bearing standards emblazoned with motifs of the Lion and the Horse; symbols of victory and conquest to his people. In his hands he carried the original Book of the Law and his female consort bore the Stele of Boulak within her arms. All around, couriers rushed towards him to report the collapse of the infid el kingdoms and the triumph of Thelema. \"Return and lead us in our Jihad, O warrior priest.\" The voices called within his ears. But again, the Sufi opened his eyes and shook his head at the temple guardian.

Taking yet another draught of smoke from the pipe, Kiff beheld himself seated upon a throne within the Holy of Holies. As High priest of the Citadel, he was entitled to sit upon the throne in the holy place as a normal part of his duties. Once more, the voices called out to him: \"Return, O High Priest and return to your duties and all shall be as it ever was.\" But once again, Kif opened his eyes and shook his head. Taking a sixth breath from the pipe, Kif closed his eyes once more and beheld a vision of the people crowning him King before crowds who knelt in supplication before him. \"Return to us, learned master,\" the voices again implored. \"Return and we shall make you king of all the Middle Kingdom wher e we dwell.\" And Kif was lost in the vision of majesty and splendour that accompanied his crowning. But, after a few moments, he again opened his eyes and shook his head at the old man. \"You have stood the test well,\" the ancient one said. \"After the seve nth breath of the Serpent, most seekers are"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"addicted. You must take one more draught from the pipe and depart, or depart now and return whence you came.\" And so Kif took up the pipe once again. But before he drew upon it a vision of the Eternal City of Py ramids came into his mind and he stood up and cast the pipe down. \"I will not draw from the pipe again.\" He stated flatly. \"But I will not return whence I came either. Show me the way from this place and I will go in peace. Refuse me and you may expect th e direful judgment of Ra Hoor Khuit. I am filled with the spirit of the smoke and will surely tear this temple apart if you do not satisfy me\" The old man laughed. \"You have passed the test, and may proceed on your journey,\" he said. \"For this is the gate way that may not be entered by those who fail to cast away the veils of illusion which bind them to the world of desire. You have reached the point where there is a fork in the road ahead. \"One more toke upon the pipe and you surely would have surrendere d to the genie of the smoke. Few travellers are able to survive even three draughts of the pipe. Go in peace, my servants will lead you to the egress. Few indeed pass through this gate, but those that do never regret their decision to travel beyond this pl ace and never return. And so Kif departed from the ruins. But as he looked back over his shoulder he saw that, from this angle at least, the Temple seemed fully restored to it's former glory and was once again whole.

The streets were empty of traffic and not a soul stirred out of doors, for it had been the hour before dawn when the weary mystic had entered the city, and the sun was even now barely abo ve the horizon. The City of Pyramids was not enclosed by walls, and no guardian stood before the gate. The gateway to the City was no visible one, being composed of the totality of life experiences necessary for any man, woman or child to find the gateway that is both within and without. The pyramids of the City were astonishing to behold. Every dwelling, every public building and every temple were pyramids of different sizes, each coloured brightly in flashing colours of marble stone. Trees, heavily lab oured with apples, oranges, pears and fruits of exotic varieties lined the streets. Elaborate drinking fountains of fantastic design stood at each street corner, surrounded by baskets of pomegranates and bread. Kif took refreshment and paused to meditate upon the splendour of the city streets. As the sun rose higher above the horizon, the pyramids cast their long shadows westwards. He had entered the city leading on the thin road winding down from the mountains and the main centre of the metropolis lay bef ore and below him, to the South. After a refreshing break, Kif continued upon his journey towards the city centre. As he continued through the streets the city's inhabitants became more evident and, after an"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"hour's walking, Kif began to recognise individu al faces amongst the growing early morning bustle. Those he passed smiled politely and cheerfully and some stopped and bowed to him before continuing on their way. Happening upon a newspaper vendor upon one street corner, Kif stopped and said: \"Hail frien d! I am a stranger in a strange land. Would you please tell me something of this place, and where I might barter for food and goods.\" The Newspaper seller looked at Kif with a twinkle in his eye and a smile playing upon his lips, and then he laughed. \"F orgive me my brother,\" he finally said. \"You are Kif, the Mayor of this city. Everyone in this city knows you and loves you. My wife sleeps regularly with your statue at night in the Garden of Statues itself, and I myself have this same conversation with y ou every morning at precisely the same time. \"There is no bartering here. Take what you need and leave the rest. Those who desire the things which you possess and which you do not need may themselves politely ask you if they might take, or at least borro w them.\" \"But how is this possible?\" Kif exclaimed. The Master of Wisdom was evidently finding himself for once at a complete loss concerning his understanding of things as they are. The street vendor reassured him: \"Be at ease Kif. In this place all thin gs happen at once. The division of night and day itself is merely a convenient illusion, a convention if you like. Things get very confusing when it is both night and day at the same time.\" A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"\"I came here to seek enlightenment,\" the sage remarked. \"And I'm merely a little confused.\" \"Don't be alarmed,\" the vendor said. \"We've had this conversation every day for as many days as I can remember, so I know that you are going to come out of things well and pretty much in control of yourself. You have to remember that enlightenment is not the same thing as an explanation.\" \"So, the City of Pyramids really is the 'centre' of Eternity?\" Kif remarked rhetorically. \"Oh, this isn't the City of Pyramids itself,\" the vendor replied. \"Merely a reflection of it in the he art of the Microcosm.\" \"So where does that leave me?\" Kif asked the man. \"Oh, here all possibilities are realised. Save for those which are anti evolutionary,\" the man said. \"We try to weed out those cycles of happening for our own purposes. But you can be sure that you will lead a very full life and rise to renown and prominence amongst our number. Why, at this very minute, you are giving a speech on the town steps, winning an election within the town hall and elsewhere doing an infinite number of other worthy things including conversing here with me. This is Eternity. or at least a reflection of it, so there is plenty of room for these things to happen here.\" \"I must find the original City of Pyramids,\" Kif stated solemnly. \"You must tell me where I may seek it.\" "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"\"But it can only be found here, in it's own reflection.\" The street vendor replied. \"At least by those of us who have travelled this far in our questing for the City. This is a true reflection of Eternity and so Eternity itself lies within its infinities.\" \"And the things that you have told me concerning my future are already taking place within this canvas of infinite variables,\" Kif muttered. \"So, where can I meditate upon these things and gain a perspective upon them? I suppose that I should seek a Temple.\" \"Oh no,\" the man answered. \"Take yourself off to the Garden of Statues and spend a few nights sleeping with the statues there. Your dreams there will inform you. Then, when you feel ready, go about your business in the City. Everything wi ll happen as I have told you and you will indeed become Mayor of this City. When you need further clarity on the things happening around you, go back to the Garden of Statues and sleep with the statue of yourself. “It is the key to Understanding. You can not physically go much further. You may join our brotherhood of the elect, and you are free to live amongst us for an Eternity. But you must seek your own Eternity within yourself.

Of course they are doing different things elsewhere in the City. Go now! I will no doubt speak to you aga in tomorrow, even if you will also be doing other things elsewhere in the city\" And Kif did as he was bidden, wandering around the shade of the City of Pyramids meeting with the wise and laughing with the cheerful people of the metropolis. That night he t ook himself off to the Garden of Statues and slept with the statue of himself, and after this he was able to perceive all that lay around him with a keen sight and alertness. The Six Gates of Tiphareth: The Thirty Fifth Gate (Tiphareth of Tiphareth ) One afternoon Kif was playing dice with Einstein in Laughing Sam's Diner, when a few stray physicists and their friends wandered in from the university campus. Every day for an eternity they met at this time of the day to play the game of chance. Einst ein waved his hand, motioning Heisenberg and Feynman to take their places beside him.

"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"\"No sign of Thomas Aquinas today?\" Kif enquired of his friends. \"He's still counting the Angels on the head of a pin,\" Aristarchus explained. \"I still maintain that there are too many,\" Duns Scotus interjected. \"He should try Cal culus,\" Newton said dryly, more than a little drunk. \"An immaculate conception,\" Duns Scotus retorted, raising his glass to Newton. \"What do you think, Heisenberg.\" \"Can't say I'm really sure,\" he replied. \"Come on, let's get these dice rolling,\" Einste in said impatiently. \"Whose betting?\" All except Aristarchus threw down a bundle of notes upon the Table. \"I still say that the lore of the die only operates in a four dimensional space time reference wherein a sphere remains a sphere from all vantage poi nts,\" he said solemnly; aware that his words would delay the game with speculative debate. \"Here in our fake City of Pyramids, even the pyramids have been known to vary with the seasons and a sphere often mutates so that it does not often remain even cir cular.\" \"I wish that you would cease referring to our city as a fake copy,\" Duns Scotus said pointedly.

Everyone hu ddled closer. Feynman was a storytelling physicist and his tales were one of the delights of the community. His insights were unique. \"Well, Feynman continued. \"We figured that in Eternity, Relativity has to be elastic; like the gravity well idea of mass affecting space - time.\" \"You are implying that consciousness in Eternity has to be a non - localised event that can only be accessed by a single reference point at any one time,\" Duns Scotus interjected excitedly, jumping ahead of the philosophical event hor izon with the deftness of a man wearing neural seven league boots. \"I was going to get around to that at the end, yes,\" Feynman said with a smile in his eyes. Then added: \"And this means that beyond this City there can be no more individual sense of ident ity. It merely becomes a case of a very fast man playing a somewhat complicated game of tennis against himself in a variety of dimensions of Space and Time.\" \"In order for me to pass through the Six Gates of this stage of my journey, I must seek the advic e of that Aspect of"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"myself that has already passed through those gates and yet still remains within this crazy citadel of Eternity.\" \"Passed through the gates, and yet remains?\" Duns Scotus enquired in a puzzled tone. \"Surely that is impossible.\" \"Not fo r a man who has turned down the sheets in Hilbert's Hotel on more than one occasion,\" the Sufi said confidently. \"Your musings on Eternity and the Dice Game - a tale not yet fully told - give me the idea that Eternal variation must also contain the possibi lities of each of the things that did not and yet cannot happen.\" \"Your musings sound familiar,\" Duns Scotus said, scratching his chin then breaking into a slow crafty smile. \"I'm sure that I may have used that argument once upon a time.\" \"I go now, to s eek my Aspect. He will be somewhere about, and I have Eternity to find him in,\" Kif said, rising to his feet. \"And there's no time like the present to do it.\" And with those words he left the room. Aristarchus was the first to speak: \"I do not understand, \" he said. \"I think that our old friend has pulled a favourable fortune cookie today.\" Feynman said approvingly. \"He portrays our gaming with dice in a unique perspective. Especially so here in the City of Pyramids.\" \"The fake City of Pyramids.\" Aristar chus said smugly.

So the fake is the real, in that it is a gate in itself tha t leads to the real.\" \"In Eternity.\" Aristarchus pointed out. \"Which is, at this time and all times, where we are at this moment.\" Feynman continued. \"So there can only be a single point of the focus of consciousness beyond the sphere of this City where even illusion must be real.\" Leibnitz mused out loud. \"And that can be the only point of objectivity from which all may be judged fair and true.\" \"And that point of focus must necessarily be everywhere at all times, alive and sentient.\" Duns Scotus annou nced. \"So Kif stands a very good chance of communing with his Aspect, sooner rather than later. Now that he himself has focused upon the matter with some urgency.\" \"And the Dice game?\" Aristarchus queried. \"The Dice are not true. Like the Cubic Stones wh ich are themselves Formless and Void: Tohu and Bohu.\" Duns Scotus explained, expansively. \"I think that was Kif's realisation, and that may give him an edge in the game,\" Einstein muttered, examining the dice and suspecting them - correctly - to be Tessar acts. \"We must continue, albeit blindly, and never give up the quest.\" "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"\"Come again?\" Aristarchus prompted. \"In plain words: If God does not play dice, then someone must.\" Einstein said bluntly. And upon the matter, he said no more. But from that day forw ard, he always won in his Dicing. The Thirty Sixth Gate (Geburah of Tiphareth) Kif had received an inspired revelation, an understanding of the nature of Eternity that helped to free his mind from the illusion of singularity which abides solely for those who inhabit the lower kingdom of the five senses. From the day of his enlightenment, the focus of his consciousness was not limited by linear recognition and he began to discover the true city within the City of Pyramids. Within hours of setting out to take a fresh exploration of the divine city Kif met old friends whose arrival he had been unaware of. He bumped into Coconut in the market place. Kilo also greeted him one afternoon in the city streets and their talk was full of philosophical speculations and imaginative theories upon the nature of the Quest. One day, Kif met another Aspect of his Self. \"Come with me,\" the other Kif said, and led him to a small temple of some forgotten god whom Kif did not recognise.

It is a fit shrine and resting place for the true God.\" \"You mean that this place is where the Big Man lives?\" \"WoMan actually.\" \"Well, I'll be..\" said Kif. \"But I have something to show y ou,\" Kif's doppelganger said, as if suddenly remembering. \"Is it something for my eyes alone?\" \"No,\" Kif's image stated bluntly. \"All see it at some point. It is a jewel of The Light. But many fail to identify it. Kilo and Coconut have seen it already.\" \"And is that my task?\" Kif enquired. \"To identify it?\" \"If you would understand in order to proceed further in the Quest,\" the other Kif replied. And then he reached into the curtains behind the altar and pulled them aside. Kif gasped. There, suspended in mid air, floated a jewel of exquisite pure light which rotated slowly counter clockwise. The Sufi was mesmerised and began to lapse into a light waking trance. \"What do you see?\" the other Kif asked. \"I see the jewel of Eternity,\" he stated. And at th at moment he beheld myriad images within the gem stone. Pictures of"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"his life on Earth, and here in Eternity, flashed along the facets of the jewel. \"My goodness,\" he exclaimed, \"it is the Jewel of my Soul. The many petalled lotus. Om Mani Padme Om.\" \"You are correct. Now, tell me how the jewel is cut?\" Kif peered intently, trying not to be distracted by the images of past and future life experiences glistening before him. And then he saw it. \"It is a cube within a cube,\" he gasped. \"It is the two stones of the formless and the void; Tohu and Bohu.\" \"It is the vision of the infinity within each of us.\" the other Kif said. And those were his last words as an entity for it seemed to Kif that his double began to grow indistinct at that moment. And then the image of his double swept towards him with incredible speed and merged with his own essence. Kif reached out and took the Jewel from above the altar, and slipped it into his robes. The Thirty Seventh Gate (Chesed of Tiphareth) Coconut was resting in t he courtyard of his castle, enjoying the luxury of the sun's rays. He had long ago made his fortune as a travelling hypnotist and had retired from his profession to a place beyond the City of Pyramids where he could enjoy the quiet of the valleys which lay beyond that mysterious place.

Philosophers would make pilgrimages there to meet with Coconut and discuss the affairs of the city with him, or to experiment in the castle's alch emic laboratory, or merely to meet with one another to debate ideas. As Coconut was idling in the sun Kif came wandering in through the gates of the courtyard. After greeting Coconut, the wise man sat down beside his friend. \"I have just returned from the valley of small circles,\" he said. \"There were many Haints along the low road that leads from that place.\" \"Yes,\" Coconut agreed. \"The stars in the heavens have been indicating strange times ahead for the lands beyond the great desert. All of us here wil l no doubt be experiencing the odd unexpected anomaly or two for a while yet. \"I do believe that a Talking Tree has been reported growing in the area too,\" Kif said casually. Coconut smiled. \"You are well informed my friend. It is only a sapling, but i t is indeed already rapping. Teenage Talking Trees can indeed be a little loose of mouth, and this one in particular has a biting sarcasm.' Kif was silent for a moment, as if in deep thought. Reaching into his robes he pulled out the jewel of the double c ube and held it out for Coconut to behold. \"I tried to steal this from the Temple of the Lost God,\" he said. \"But it is a jewel that is impossible to steal.\" "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"\"And yet you possess it?\" Coconut enquired. \"I have made peace with my daemon,\" Kif explained. \" The multiplicity of being has now been replaced by the multiplicity of phenomena.\" \"You mean?\" Coconut enquired. \"When I entered the City, I soon became aware of the infinity of possibilities open to the Many Selves.\" said.Kif \"I have reversed the equati on and now I am one with the time - track and have achieved the unity of the selves. I am simultaneously aware of all that has happened, is happening and has yet to happen from the focus of this moment in time.\" \"And the riddle of your stealing the jewel th at cannot be stolen?\" Coconut again enquired. \"It is the jewel of the Great Fall from the Throne,\" Kif stated. \"It can be borne yet never taken. Hence I have always possessed it?\" \"And me!\" Coconut said, a secretly concealed smile now bursting upon his f ace. And with a swift reach of his hand he produced the same jewel from his own robes. The Thirty Eighth Gate (Binah of Tiphareth) When Kif returned to the City of Pyramids, he found that the flavour of the city's atmosphere had changed considerably. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The journey from Coconut's castle had been long and arduous and as time had passed Kif noticed that more and more Haints could be seen hovering on the edge of the roadway during the hours of twilight. By the time that he reached the city walls the freq uency of Haint disturbance had grown to a considerable level and, upon entering the city, Kif began to comment upon this to the first people he came across who seemed at leisure to converse. \"Can't say I know what you mean,\" one said. \"Haven't noticed th em myself,\" another responded. One other merely said: \"Haint yourself,\" and gave him a knowing smile before walking off, seemingly fading to become indistinct as his shape receded into the distance. Kif was puzzled for a moment. Then his mind cleared and he took himself off to the Magick Shop where he knew he might find the means to resolve the growing suspicion that his personal momentum was moving faster than his awareness of it. The walls of the Magick Shop were decorated with murals of snow crested m ountain landscapes beneath azure skies flecked with white cumulus. Above, the ceiling was draped with a silk of jet black adorned with rare gemstones which glittered like starlight. In the front of the shop was a tent pyramid of the finest silk situated i n the midst of two concentric magic circles, within"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"whose trough grew magic mushrooms the size of a mans hands. Mahindra , the shop's owner was talking to Doctor Dirk while Elron and Aine inspected the latest crop of freshly picked Cuban psilocybin. \"Gre etings, O learned one\" Mahindra said, looking up from his conversation. \"And to you too,\" Kif responded. Then nodded his head in greeting to the good Doctor who returned a smile. \"I am in need of a trip and the services of your meditation chamber whilst i t is kicking in.\" Mahindra nodded his head. \"Feel free to stay the night,\" he said courteously. \"We are about to close up for the night but here's a key to the door, you can use the room upstairs to come up on your trip and then meditate in the magic circ le when the shop is closed.\" Aine handed Kif a medium sized mushroom and smiled graciously. After eating the mushroom Kif decided to remain downstairs and swap stories with the shop keeper and his friends, telling them of his journey from Coconut's castl e and of the Haints haunting the way. Dr Dirk played with his Van Dyke beard and paid great attention to the traveller’s story. Mahindra nodded along, interrupting only with the occasional pertinent question *to interrupt the wise man's tale.

Dr Dirk looked towards Mahindra to take up the explanation. Mahindra said: \"Dr Dirk and I took the jewel for ourselves some time ago. I think that you h ave come to the right place to find your solution.\" \"I think that you will find your conception of Haints changing over the next few hours,\" Dr Dirk said quietly. \"They are no mere ghosts, as rumoured amongst the common people, but the true denizens of th e City of Pyramids itself. Having taken the jewel which cannot be stolen, you will find yourself counting amongst their number soon enough; as we once did.\" \"Then I am talking to Haints?\" Kif asked, amazed, and beginning to feel the first edges of the mus hroom trip send shivers throughout his etheric body. \"There are many gates to the palace of the Great Mother,\" Dr Dirk explained. \"As you pass through more of them, the Haints will become more recognisable to you as distinct beings. Indeed, you already ap pear to perceive some of them as corporeal beings; such as the last person you spoke to on the way here.\""},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" \"Amazing,\" said Kif. \"But forgive me, I must take myself away into the meditation room. I feel my trip coming on.\" Bidding goodbye to all, he ascende d the stairs to the chamber.\" An hour later, Kif came down the stairs. The light was fading and only the street lights shining in through the window from outside illuminated the empty shop. Sitting inside the magic circle of living mushrooms, under the ca nopy of the silk pyramid, the wise man eased himself into a state of meditation. His consciousness was intensely heightened from the effects of the mushroom and the focus of his thoughts was more attuned to that state normally experienced by out of the bo dy voyagers. The clouds painted upon the mountain - scape adorned walls seemed to move to and fro in the half light and Kif's senses were disassociated to a degree that left his mind free to roam the world of potentia. Taking the jewel which cannot be stole n from his robes he held it before him, examining it closely and looking into it's depths. It seemed to Kif that it began to shine, with a light that originated from somewhere deep within itself, and as it did so he began to discern the shape of Haints all around him. \"Greetings, fellow souls,\" Kif said in salutation. \"I have walked amongst your brothers and sisters on the road to this city. You are the first I hope to exchange greetings with.\" A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The Haint that replied was female and, as her shape became mo re substantial, the holy man could see that she was beautiful. Long auburn hair fell down her back in waves and she was slim and enticing and her vague features were faintly familiar to him. \"I am pleased to meet you again, Kif.\" She said. \"Many of us have been monitoring your energies in your transitions through the Gates.\" \"I am privileged to have made your acquaintance,\" Kif stated flatly. The girl laughed at this. He continued: \"The waves of revelation have given me something of a perpetual culture sho ck recently. I am afraid that the advantage is yours madam,\" \"Make love with me,\" she whispered. And with those words she fell upon him, stripped him of his robes and took him into herself. When they had finished making love, she leaned back. \"The energy transfer is complete,\" she whispered. \"I know you,\" Kif whispered back. \"I have faced many challenges upon the path that has led me to this point, and yet you have done things with me that only my wife and I have shared.\" At this the girl began to laug h. \"You fool.

But remember, you can only be seen as a Haint now outside the shadow City of Pyramids. You have come too far to return whence you came.\" Noticing that her husband looked slightly downcast, she co ntinued: \"You already grasp that Time is a non essential when it comes to causality. You have taken your place within the Cubic Stone of the Vault. In fact, you have everything you need at this point to do your will as a free citizen of the true City. Look not downcast. The Leah that awaits your return in the Garden of Statues will always be there, in some dimension of Time. \"From this point on you will find yourself flashing in and out of contact with the true City more and more as your confidence in you r own perceptions increases.\" \"Then, in some way, I have already returned and accompanied you hence.\" Kif said, almost to himself. \"Perhaps, by using the jewel that cannot be stolen, the Cubic Stone itself? And it is a reality that I have not yet accessed , else I would have past or future recall of it?\" \"You should have more faith in women,\" Leah as Babalon stated. \"I actually arrived here ahead of you.

The Thirty Ninth Gate (Chokmah of Tiphareth) In the hour before dawn, long after his wife had faded back to the shadow world of which Kif was only dimly beginning to become aware he sense d an ominously large shape shifting around behind him. Sitting still within the silken pyramid within the magic circle, he nervously fingered the jewel of the Cubic Stone which hung around his neck on a thin cord. The atmosphere was electric with expectan cy, and with the heightened sense of euphoria which his sexual and psychedelic experience had aroused. Still, Kif could sense a powerful alien presence radiating pure energy and he became gripped with a paralysis that stifled his very breath. Suddenly the crystal cube began to emanate light, brilliant beyond intensity. \"I am Random! Your Guardian Angel,\" a voice whispered with sombre intensity. \"I greet you as an equal,\" was all Kif could murmur. \"I have thought long and hard upon your coming, and always knew it would be at an unexpected hour,\" he then added. "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"\"This is your moment of testing,\" Random continued. \"I will be your ally if you truly know yourself. If not, then I will be your nemesis.\" Kif swallowed hard and gave the entity his full attention. \"There are two tasks to fulfil to make your peace with me.\" Random continued. \"Both require that you satisfy me on your knowledge of my true nature. First comes a question: What am I?\" Kif thought for a moment, his mind suddenly becoming clear. \"You are my hopes and my fears.\" He said. \"You have answered the question yourself in your asking of it. You are the angel I am the kinetic potential of, and also the demon of my most powerful desires.\" \"And what do you intend to do about me?\" Random asked curiou sly, satisfied at Kif's answer. Kif turned to face the angel. \"I will welcome you.\" He announced. \"There comes a time when we must live with whom we actually are and play the hand that is dealt to us. \" And Random and Sufi became one, for good or ill. The Fortieth Gate (Kether of Tiphareth) Kif wandered for days exploring the sacred city. It seemed to him that the more time he spent examining the detail of the City of Pyramids, the more the facets of the real 'city within a city' revealed themselves. A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Every night, at twilight, he would meet with his wife Leah at some prearranged location and explore the City at night. Kif was becoming more used to the ghostly Haints, and with the passing of each night they too became more and more substantial until he was able to converse with them. Over the first month, Kif and Leah would make love together with increasing relish; their senses heightened and their minds and bodies aflame with the psychedelic effects of the mushrooms they had purchased from the Magic Mushroom shop. And afterwards Leah would remain longer and longer with her husband in their adventures in the gas lit streets of the City. On the eighth night Leah led her husband by the hand over the first bell bridge of the famous 'Street of Seven Bell Bridges'. \"From here you can see into the Abyss,\" she said. \"Stare first at the symbol of the sea shell upon the bridge's crest and then look down into the water, at the moonlight reflected there.\" Kif looked over the bridge's handrail and his eyes miste d over. Somewhere in the depths of the water he could see shapes moving around. And then all became clear. Bound naked men and women were being tied to wooden platforms by green and black slimy creatures. Centipede - like tendrils tore and flayed the flesh o f their victims whilst half naked men and women looked on from the edges of the torture pit with a depraved craving for blood lust shining in their eyes. Breaking the spell with a click of her fingers, Leah led Kif on to the next bridge over the canal. Th is bridge had the motif of a closed human hand, which Kif meditated upon before"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"looking into the water. Therein he saw a figure laid out upon a dungeon slab. The woman's skin had been removed from her body and she lay raw and defenceless, bound and pegged down to a torture bed. Two grotesque dwarves laboured over her eye sockets with red hot irons. Kif flinched away from the sight of the horror. Leading Kif to the third bridge, Leah bade him to meditate upon the symbol of the open hand upon the bridge's cr est, before looking down into the depths. The horror which beheld him gripped his frame with an icy hand. The smell of burning flesh was unimaginable as Kif beheld the sad remains of the characters from the vision before him having their tongues cut out of their mouths and their ears and noses sealed with red hot brands. The Holy man was paralysed by the sight of these horrors and began to shake with fear. At the fourth bridge, after meditating upon the symbol of the fallen corn stalk, the wise man behel d one of the disfigured creatures having his back broken over a wheel, severing all sensory input into the man's brain. His broken form was cast aside into a corner, onto a heap of similar forms of past humanity. The sights which Kif beheld at the fifth, sixth and seventh bridges (where the symbols of the black rose, the funnel and the snake eating the egg were to be found) are not fit for human comprehension. Here, the shells of the victims were given over to the demons of the pit for gargantuan perversio ns of the most depraved nature.

Come, make love to me on this bridge and we will become one. Only the united may pass through this trial of fire.\" The Five gates of Geburah: The Forty First Gate (Geburah of Geburah) A child was born to Leah and Kif, and they named her Aia. All of the inhabitants of the City of Pyramids brought gifts of incense and eggs of the crystal serpent for the child's nativity. As Aia grew, Kif and Leah began to grow noticeably younger. And Aia grew most prodi giously and swiftly, aging a single year in what seemed to Leah and Kif to be a single month. Her parents too began to grow younger at an equally alarming rate, until their apparent ages seemed to coincide. Over the months, Kif had taught his daughter i n the interpretation of the Law, and Leah had imparted that secret knowledge to her daughter concerning the mysteries of enchantment and vision understood by all women in their heart of hearts. Since Aia had reached puberty she had"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"outgrown her parents kno wledge and in matters of philosophical discourse, logical analysis and intuitive understanding of human and angelic nature she was a constant source of surprise and inspiration to them both. At the time of the converging of the apparent ages of the twain, parents and child, Aia pointed towards the setting sun and said: \"You must go into the West and seek the Night of Time. And you must go this very night.\" Kif and Leah had a achieved what could almost be described as a telepathic sympathy with their daught er, and recognised that she had identified a key moment in their mutual destinies. The Great Desert, beyond which lay the Great Sea, beckoned them beyond Aia's pointing finger. \"You came to this place, but I was born here,\" she said. \"The adventure has on ly begun for us, but for any of us to survive you must move on from this place and seek Amenta, lest we all find ourselves cast into the seven hells below the bell bridges.\" And so Aia's parents packed two saddle bags with rations for the journey and, aft er many tender farewells, set out upon two ships of the desert sands towards the West. On the journey westwards, as they were leaving the hills which surrounded the City Leah and Kif came upon an old brick forge and a blacksmith working upon a brand new s word there. Other swords which the Smith had recently forged hung from the rafter inside the doorway. Stopping his camel, Kif commanded the beast to kneel and dismounted. \"Tell me Smith,\" Kif spoke, \"how much will you charge me for a sword.\" A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" \"Thirty piec es of silver,\" the Smith replied. \"But you must cure the sword yourself if you have the wit.\" He pointed towards the sword lying within the furnace. Kif paid the man his money and put on one of the Smith's leather gauntlets before retrieving the sword fro m the fire. Walking out into the desert night, he cut himself across the left forearm with the glowing sword. Kif flinched as his blood dripped onto the floor, but the wound cauterised and healed as quickly as it had been made. He then thrust the white hot steel into the sand and blood to temper the blade. \"Truly you have claimed the sword from the furnace,\" the Smith said quietly. \"You must bear it now into the West, and always carry it with you.\" And with those words he disappeared into the smithy with a smile upon his face. The Forty Second Gate (Chesed of Geburah) Aia watched her parents until they disappeared over the western horizon and began to make preparations for her own journey. At dawn the next day she set off on a camel of her own towards the ice lands which lay to the north of the City of Pyramids. And after four days of journeying she came to the ice cavern of the God of the Crystal Snake where she conversed with the temple guardian. \"My father and mother are bearing the sword of Edom i nto the West,\" she told him. \"I seek the Torch of the double handed one; the wand of power.\""},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" \"You may find it by joining in congress with the God of the Crystal Snake himself and awakening the Torch within you,\" the temple guardian replied. And so Aia sp ent a further night at the Temple and prepared herself for sexual union with the God. The ritual of Becoming lasted a whole night and a day. The Pythonesses of the Temple bathed Aia in milk baths, fed her rich foods and then gave her strange drugs and win es that foamed. The temple dance, which she joined, was a bacchanalia of revelry and at the height of the ritual the Crystal Serpent himself manifested upon the central altar, upon which the acolytes in his service had placed Aia for the orgiastic lovemaki ng with the god. The magical union was observed in the presence of all, and Aia felt waves of energy and power coursing through her with each orgasm. At the climax of the rite, the Crystal Serpent God disappeared into the girl's body and Aia gave out an e cstatic cry. All fell to their knees before her as, breathless, she drew herself up from the altar. Her eyes shone with the knowledge of a thousand and one delights. Her skin glowed like burning coals. Majestically she rose to her feet and proclaimed: \"I am the Heart, and the Snake is entwined about the invisible core of the mind.\" The temple guardian approached her. \"You must bear the torch to the South,\" he instructed her. \"To balance the passage of the sword westwards.\" A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"\"And there I will make my home in the branches of the World Tree made of Ash, where I will light a beacon of hope for the world, Aia said softly. \"It will be my final act of love, for the flame will burn forever and our children will build there a temple of glory. A temple of the ever burning flame. Then I will cast from me the burden of the Quest and make my own way to Amenta in the West.\" \"You are our Phoenix. O Torch Bearer,\" the temple guardian said reverently. Then more loudly, so that all could hear, he shouted: \"Hail o ye twin w arriors who guard the pylons of the middle path. One has come who will carry the light from the darkness, and who has the strength and wisdom to bear the flame with purpose and intent. One who sees the ending of The Way and yet who dares to look beyond the clearly marked path.\" And Aia soon began her journey to the south. Bearing the fire of the Torch within her soul and changing forever the lives of those with whom she talked to or made love with at the oases and temples that lined the route of her journe y Southward. The Forty Third Gate (Binah of Geburah) Aia approached the shores of the Great Sea on camel - back. She was wrapped in robes of the deepest black silk which blew in the sea breeze from the west.

As Aia had left the burning tree she had picked up a lithe branch which h ad fallen to the ground. Later she fashioned arrows for her small bow which she carried even now on her approach to the shore of the Great Sea. Dismounting from her camel, Aia ran along the beach to the seas edge. The Sun was rising behind her and the bri ghtening of the waters was glorious to behold. Taking her bow and quiver of arrows from her shoulder she slipped out of her robes and stood naked beneath the fading western stars save for her decorative anklet of the serpent. The weather was warming and Aia lay down at the edge of the water, with the incoming tide lapping against her ankles and naked legs. Taking an arrow from her quiver Aia concentrated upon its tip and caused it to burst into flame.

The incoming tide was reaching over her thighs and, as it touched the base of her spine, the flaming arrow plunged into the heaving waters. An echo of an ancient ecstasy ran up Aia's backbone then, sending waves of rapture through her entire mind and body. The sky lit up into a brilliant scarlet which was reflected upon the mirror of the sea, and the image of a distant citadel appeared in the heavens above the horizon. \"This sea is m ade up of the blood of Saints. And the City may only be entered by the immortals,\" a disembodied voice sounded in Aia's head. \"You will come upon the token of entry into the Eternal City somewhere upon these seas. You must use your craft and your guile. On ly Serpents may swim in these waters. But you are of the Dove and the Serpent. Choose your passage to the city with care.\" And Aia meditated upon these happenings for a day and a night thereafter. The Forty Fourth Gate (Chokmah of Geburah) The Lost G od and the boatman were sailing upon the waters of the Great Sea. They had been dredging the bottom of that mighty ocean in their search for the plant of immortality for over a year and a day. Now that they had successfully located it, they were celebratin g their find with a bottle of the finest wine and swapping stories of old times."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" The Lost God told a story of how he had made a friend of his greatest enemy, a savage created by the other gods with the purpose of opposing him in all his questing. His frie nd had lost his savagery after being introduced to civilisation by a sophisticated courtesan of the City of Pyramids with whom he had fallen in love. He told the boatman of his friend's tragic journey to and consequent imprisonment within the underworld, and of his sadness concerning his friend's fate. The plant of immortality lay safe within the hold of their vessel and as the afternoon went on both the god and the boatman fell into a deep drunken sleep. Aia had shape shifted into the form of a serpent so that she might swim across the mighty ocean to the Eternal City of the West, and came upon their boat in the midst of the ocean. Having stolen on board unnoticed, she eavesdropped upon their conversation and learned of the plant of immortality within th e hold. When they fell into their slumber, Aia transformed herself back into human guise and stole below. Returning to the deck with her prize, her footsteps awoke the Lost God who started after her. Shifting her shape into the form of a dove and clutchi ng the valuable plant within her talons Aia flew into the skies, leaving the angry god and the boatman far below shaking their fists at the air.

Only those who are capable of change and adaptation may seize and hold the prize which you have been seeking.” The Forty Fifth Gate (Kether of Geburah) A feast was being held in the Eternal Ci ty, to celebrate the wedding of the White King and his Red Queen. The ceremony was held on the steps of the Palace of the city, and was solemnised by the Magisters of the Temple. Flowers of rare scents and the emblems of Daath adorned the outer walls of the palace and the twin pillars which stood either side of the palace doorway were adorned with bells and rich fruits such as the pomegranate. After the marriage ceremony had been performed, the assistant Magisters carried the King and his bride to the al tar of the black and white double cube at the foot of the palace steps, where the love feast would be celebrated before the people. Without pausing for a moment of sobriety, the King and the Queen divested themselves of their robes and joined in the embra ce of sexual union to consummate their marriage. At that moment a dove flew into the courtyard from beyond the city walls, carrying the plant of immortality within it's beak, and landed upon the base of the altar. "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The assistant Magister gently picked it up from the floor and, taking his ceremonial dagger in the other hand, slit it's throat in ritual sacrifice so that the blood of the divine bird spilled over the writhing bodies of the celebrants. The plant of immortality fell to the floor of the altar wh ere it took root, and a few drops of the blood of the dove dripped from the altar and seeped into the ground where the plant lay. Years later, the plant of immortality grew into a mighty tree which gave forth all sorts of mysterious fruit from which the M agisters of the temple distilled the \"wines that foam\" of which the Book of the Law speaks. One day, after a particularly fine feast in honour of an anniversary of the royal marriage, the White King and his Red Queen conceived a child after eating of the fruit of the tree and drinking of the wines that foam that sprang from that fruit. The child would later grow to become the Queen of the Eternal Palace, full of wisdom and compassion for the world and all who trod upon it. But the King and the Queen were distressed, for they knew not what to name her. The learned and the scribes of the Eternal Kingdom were loath to proffer their opinion upon the matter, and the King was distressed that no one could suggest a name which his daughter might bear proudly. One day, upon the advice of the Chief Magister of the Temple, the King and Queen disguised themselves and took the girl child to the Garden of Eternity which had sprung up around the Tree of Immortality, where a wise A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"man and his wife had lately taken up their dwelling under the branches of the Tree. The Red Queen gave her baby into the arms of the Wise Man, saying: \"Like the King and Queen of this city, we cannot decide upon a name for our child and will not rest until our problem is resolved.\" Recognising t he Red Queen beneath her disguise, the Wise Man replied: \"Dear Lady. The questions we must face upon death are forty two in number. They emanate from the forty two assessors of the Soul. This question of yours, posed as it is at the beginning of a life, sh ould reflect this.\" \"What do you suggest, O Wise Man,\" the White King demanded, aware that the sage spoke from the heart. \"You shall call her 'Aia',\" the Sufi suggested. \"which means 'Answerer' in my native tongue.\" And the White King and the Red Queen returned to their palace and did as he suggested. And Aia grew to magnificence as the Queen of that realm, and became as renowned as Solomon for her wisdom and knowledge of the Divine Law.\" Gates Forty Six to Forty Nine \"There are four gates to on e palace. The floor of that palace is of silver and gold. Lapis Lazuli and jasper are there and all rare scents and the emblems of death....\" Liber Al vel Legis [The Book of the Law] Ch1 Verse 51 \"On the Eastern gate, he placed the form of an Eagle; on t he Western gate the form of a Bull; on the Southern gate"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"the form of a Lion; and on the Northern gate he constructed the form of a Dog. Into these images he introduced spirits who spoke with voices, nor could anyone enter the gates of the City except by th eir permission.

On the summit of the castle he caused to be raised a lighthouse [rotunda] the colour of which changed every day until the seventh day aft er which it returned to the first colour, and so the City was illuminated with these colours.
