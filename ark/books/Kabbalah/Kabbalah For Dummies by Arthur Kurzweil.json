For Kabbalists, all thelaws, customs, practices, holidays, and rituals of Judaism are best understoodin light of the Kabbalistic teachings about God and of what it is that God wantsfrom humans.Over the centuries, Kabbalah has become more and more systematized. BrilliantJewish sages have explored, developed, and refined Jewish theology to the pointat which, in the last six centuries, Kabbalah has become a distinct system ofideas, beliefs, technical terminology, and values with its own history, greatpersonalities, controversies, and vocabulary. But Kabbalah, which means “thereceived tradition,” has always been an integral part of Jewish religious andspiritual life.Like other studies of divinity and spirituality, Kabbalah deals with ultimatequestions: Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going? What for? Why?ABOUT THIS BOOKKabbalah is often thought to be a secret study occupying the minds of elitestudents throughout the ages. But the “secrets” of Kabbalah aren’t the typicalkind in which information is revealed to the few.There are two kinds of secrets:bullet [Images/check.png] Secrets that are kept from the public: When revealed,these secrets are recognized for what they are: clever illusions that, oncerevealed, can never fool again. Whatever “mysteries” the illusions once helddisappear.bullet [Images/check.png] Real secrets that are available for all to see: Whenreal secrets are explored, they become deeper and more profound. They becomericher and give birth to even greater secrets while their revelations illuminatethe world. Such are the so-called “secrets” of Kabbalah.My goal in writing this book is to help set the record straight and to informthe general public about what Kabbalah is — and also what Kabbalah isn’t.In recent years Kabbalah has become a pop culture phenomenon, a developmentthat’s resulted in the spread of tremendous inaccuracies and misinformationabout the subject. This book is for those who are curious about the subject aswell as for those who sincerely want to begin to grasp some of the profoundteachings of Kabbalah and to integrate Kabbalistic wisdom into their dailylives.Unfortunately, some books represent Kabbalah as a New Age, mystical practicedealing with amulets, obscure forms of meditation, superstition, and occultpractices. Some books on Kabbalah separate Kabbalah from Judaism, misinformingwell-meaning students and encouraging them to think of Kabbalah as a generalphilosophy of life rather than as a spiritual practice inextricably integratedinto Jewish law, ritual, prayer, and study.Kabbalah For Dummies explains in plain English both the major abstract ideas ofKabbalah as well as the Kabbalistic practices that are part of daily Jewishlife. Although the study of Kabbalah can be a major commitment that influences apractitioner’s entire life, a person can pick up on many profound approaches tolife just by considering the ideas and perspectives of Kabbalah.CONVENTIONS USED IN THIS BOOKBecause Kabbalah is a complex and often controversial topic, I had to establisha few conventions while writing to keep things as fair and simple as possible.As you’re reading Kabbalah For Dummies, please keep in mind my conventionsregarding the following:bullet [Images/check.png] References to God: Kabbalistic notions about Godinclude the fundamental belief that the Almighty doesn’t have a gender, sowhenever possible, I refrain from referring to God using masculine pronouns.However, the primary language of Judaism, Hebrew, doesn’t have a neutral gender,so most Hebrew nouns are masculine. In addition, although there’s a female termthat indicates God’s indwelling presence in the world, the male forms of God’snames have their own spiritual significance (Kabbalistic tradition has manynames for God, as I explain in Chapter 16). In Jewish prayers, for example, Godis referred to as “He.” This isn’t sexism; God is neither He nor She, so pleasedon’t be offended when God is referred to as “He.”bullet [Images/check.png] The word “Kabbalist”: Throughout this book I refer tothings that Kabbalists do or believe. In reality, none of the great (or evennot-so-great) Kabbalists ever referred to themselves as Kabbalists. All thegreat Kabbalists throughout history have been Jews, more specificallytraditional, observant Jews. In today’s terms, they’d probably be calledOrthodox Jews.I use the term “Kabbalist” through this book to refer to those people, greatsages, or everyday people like me who integrate into their lives the beautifulJewish practices and profound ideas that are part of Jewish tradition and haveexplicit connection to Jewish theological — and therefore Kabbalistic — ideas.A great sage is referred to as a Kabbalist because he wrote about or taught thetheology of Judaism and was specifically interested in using the vocabulary andessential ideas contained in the theological, esoteric explorations of Judaism.Even today, teachers who are considered masters of Kabbalah aren’t generallyknown as Kabbalists; instead, the term mekubal (meh-koo-bahl) indicates that acertain teacher is a qualified teacher of Kabbalah and is known for his or herKabbalistic teachings.bullet [Images/check.png] Hasidism: In recent centuries, there have been twostreams of Kabbalah study.• One is represented by the great rabbi born in the year 1720 known as RabbiElijah (also known as the Vilna Gaon). He saw Kabbalah as a subject reserved forstudy only by the best students.• The other is represented by the great rabbi born around the same time, in1698, known as Rabbi Israel (also known as the Baal Shem Tov). The thrust of histeaching was to bring the wisdom and practice of Kabbalah to the average person,not just to the elite scholar. This effort is called Hasidism.In this book, many of the sages that I quote and many of the Kabbalisticpractices that I address come from Hasidism, which is basically the effortduring the last few centuries within Judaism to bring Kabbalah to the masses.Because Kabbalah For Dummies is an effort to explain Kabbalah to as many peopleas possible, it’s filled with teachings from Hasidism, which is Kabbalah foreveryone.bullet [Images/check.png] Dates: I don’t use the abbreviations BC and AD toindicate dates in this book because these designations measure time in relationto Christian history. Rather, I use BCE, which means “Before the Common Era” andCE, which means “Common Era.” For example, the year that Columbus discoveredAmerica would be indicated as 1492 CE.bullet [Images/check.png] Gender equality: Religious groups throughout historyhave defined participatory roles for men and women in a number of ways.Throughout this book, I’ve tried to approach subjects from a starting point thatassumes that both men and woman can participate in all Jewish rituals. However,it’s important to note that the Kabbalistic tradition isn’t gender neutral; itmaintains that men and women are spiritually different. When men and women honorand celebrate these differences through practices and roles unique to eachgender, they fully realize the deeper spiritual dimension of their lives and theunique contributions to the world that emanate from these different spiritualplaces.bullet [Images/check.png] Pronunciation of Hebrew words: Many Hebrew words andphrases appear throughout this book, and because not everyone’s familiar withthe language, I’ve offered pronunciation help. The syllable that has the accentis always in italics. But you should be aware that there are two ways topronounce many Hebrew words:• Ashkenazic: This is the Eastern European pronunciation that’s used in mostOrthodox synagogues. An example is Shabbos (shah-bus; Sabbath), with the accenton the first syllable.• Sephardic: This is the modern Israeli pronunciation that’s used in mostliberal synagogues in the United States. An example is Shabbat (shah-baht;Sabbath), with the accent on the second syllable.As you can see from the examples, not only are the pronunciations of the soundsdifferent, but the accented syllable is also different. It isn’t unusual forsomeone today to bounce back and forth between pronunciations. In thetraditional Jewish world I’ve live in for the past 25 years, pronunciation ofHebrew words is generally Ashkenazic. But the modern Israeli pronunciation alsohas a great influence, and some of my pronunciations reflect this. For example,I sometimes find myself saying both “Shabbos” and “Shabbat” on the Sabbath,sometimes within mere moments of each other. In this book, I mostly use thetransliteration and pronunciation commonly used in Israel, but sometimes,especially if it has become common usage, I give the Ashkenazic pronunciation.By the way, another example of varied pronunciation is the word “Kabbalah.” TheAshkenazic pronunciation is kuh-bah-lah, whereas the modern Israelipronunciation is kah-bah-lah.WHAT YOU’RE NOT TO READIf you have the time and inclination to read this book from cover to cover, byall means, get to it! However, if you’re only looking for the most helpful, mostessential facts and explanations, you can skip the sidebars, which appear inshaded gray boxes throughout this book. They’re interesting (I hope!) anecdotesand pieces of information that supplement the text but aren’t essential for anunderstanding of the topics being explored.FOOLISH ASSUMPTIONSWhen writing this book, I had to make some assumptions about you, dear reader.First off, I don’t assume that you’re Jewish, nor do I assume that you want tobe. And although Kabbalah is just as much a spiritual practice as a spiritualtheory, I don’t assume that you want to engage in each and every practice.Following are some additional assumptions I’ve made. If you fit into any ofthese categories, this book is for you:bullet [Images/check.png] You’ve heard about Kabbalah and are curious about it,perhaps because some showbiz personality has said that he or she is studying itor because it was a part of your general education but you don’t have a firmgrasp of what it’s all about.bullet [Images/check.png] You want to know more about Kabbalah, whether you’rereligious or not.bullet [Images/check.png] You know little or nothing about Jewish religiouspractice, which is really the framework of Kabbalah.bullet [Images/check.png] Like so many people, you’ve tried to understand whatlife is all about, and you’ve heard that Kabbalah has its own approach to thebig, eternal questions of life.bullet [Images/check.png] You’ve heard about some things that the media claimsare part of Kabbalah (like wearing a red string around your wrist or drinkingKabbalah water), and you want to know if there’s any truth or authentic basis tothese things.bullet [Images/check.png] You’re a spiritual seeker, and you’ve heard thatKabbalah is a spiritual approach to life.bullet [Images/check.png] You know people who are “into Kabbalah” and you wantto understand them better.bullet [Images/check.png] You may or may not be Jewish, but you’re curious aboutJews who call themselves Hasidic, which means they live a religious lifestylebased on the principles and practices of Kabbalah.bullet [Images/check.png] You’ve been told that Kabbalah is a secret tradition,and you want to know what the secret is all about.bullet [Images/check.png] You’re Jewish but feel that the Judaism you know islacking in spirituality — and you’ve been led to believe that Kabbalah is thespiritual path (and sometimes even called the soul) of Judaism.HOW THIS BOOK IS ORGANIZEDI organized this book so that you can skip around easily. In order to help youget in, get the information you need, and get out without reading cover tocover, I divided the book into parts that give you one piece of the Kabbalahpicture at a time.PART I: SO, WHAT’S THE BIG SECRET? UNMASKING KABBALAHThis part provides you with the basics. First, you get an overview of the entiresubject, in particular its major ideas and concepts. Because Kabbalah hasevolved over the centuries and is populated by many key teachers throughout theages, a history of Kabbalah is a must. Although I’ve taken great pains to avoidtechnical language, Kabbalah, like every field of study, has its own uniqueterms and vocabulary. This part introduces these terms with clear explanations.And because so much misinformation floats around about Kabbalah, I explore andexplain what Kabbalah isn’t.PART II: CUTTING TO THE CORE OF KABBALAHEvery worldview, philosophy, and religion has assumptions, and Kabbalah is noexception. This part presents what I would say are the two major assumptions atthe heart of Kabbalah: The world is in need of repair, and the human soul iseternal. These two assumptions also have a connection to each other: The work ofthe human soul is to use its body to repair the world. This part explores howKabbalists participate in repairing the world as well as the nature and journeyof the human soul.PART III: LIVIN’ LA VIDA KABBALAHThis part puts the theory of Kabbalah into practice. Kabbalah isn’t just anabstract philosophy, and it isn’t just a system of ideas. Kabbalah is a way oflife. There are things Kabbalists do every day, every week, every year, andthroughout their lives, from birth to death. These acts and others giveexpression to the profound and eternal ideas taught by the great sages ofKabbalah. The chapters in this part cover the major activities, celebrations,and rituals that make up the life of a Kabbalist.PART IV: FINE-TUNING THE ESSENTIAL SKILLS OF THE KABBALISTIn this part, I define and explore the two almost-constant activities ofKabbalists: study and prayer. Both activities are expressions of one’srelationship to God; the study of the holy books of Kabbalah and the recitationof daily prayers define the ongoing conversation that Kabbalists have with God.This part concludes with an in-depth look at the Kabbalistic view of God, knownto Kabbalists as the Infinite One.PART V: THE PART OF TENSEvery For Dummies book has a Part of Tens. This part consists of interestinglists people, places, and myths related to Kabbalah. With so much misinformationfloating around about Kabbalah, I take on the ten biggest myths circulating inbooks and in the media. I move on to well-known Kabbalists throughout the ages,of which the cream of the crop are easily identifiable. Even though thewell-known artist, Madonna, whose work I enjoy and admire, doesn’t belong insuch a list, she’s the first person who comes to mind for many people who knowlittle about Kabbalah, so I discuss her in this part. And because there are manyplaces around the globe of particular interest to Kabbalists, this part containsan enlightening Kabbalistic travelogue. I wrap up this collection of lists withmy top recommendations of Kabbalistic books and authors.PART VI: APPENDIXESHere I’ve included a few more handy items that didn’t really fit elsewhere inthe book but are important just the same. Appendix A is a list of books andauthors related to Kabbalah, Appendix B is a breakdown of the importantcharacters in the Torah, and Appendix C is a convenient glossary of all thingsKabbalah.ICONS USED IN THIS BOOKAll For Dummies books feature icons (little pictures that grab your attention)in the margins to serve you well. Think of them as road signs pointing todifferent kinds of information in the chapters.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]Kabbalistic ideas are often well-documented in holy books, but an essentialtransmission of Kabbalah moves from teacher to student.

Be sure to readthis information!WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]This icon highlights instances in which I quote directly from classicKabbalistic sources. These sources are English translations of insights andobservations made by some of the greatest sages in Jewish and, therefore,Kabbalistic history.WHERE TO GO FROM HEREThe classic books of Kabbalah don’t begin at the beginning; throughout the ages,students of Kabbalah have jumped into a holy book at any point and startedswimming through it. In fact, when studying a book of Kabbalah, it often isn’tuntil the second time around that the reader begins to really understand thedepths of the text. Often, concepts build upon each other, and it isn’t until astudent grasps a certain idea that he or she can start building ideas uponideas.Kabbalah For Dummies works in a similar way — it doesn’t necessarily begin atthe beginning. Like Kabbalists throughout history, why not just jump in whereveryou want to begin? Although I’ve tried to provide a useful introduction to theentire subject in Chapter 1, you can just look through the table of contents andpick out something of special interest. For example, if you’ve studied Easternreligions, you know that reincarnation is a fundamental notion, and so you maybe interested in the Kabbalistic take on the topic in Chapter 7.Bob Dylan once wrote the lyric that he doesn’t want to learn something that hehas to “unlearn.” Unfortunately, many false notions and half truths aboutKabbalah circulate these days, so you may want to first clean the slate and“unlearn” what you’ve heard by turning to Chapter 2, which tells you whatKabbalah isn’t. And you may want to supplement that information with Chapter17’s take on myths about studying Kabbalah.But wherever you begin, get ready to enter a profound worldview that hasinspired and sustained countless spiritual seekers since time immemorial."},{"pageContent":"PART ISO, WHAT’S THE BIG SECRET? UNMASKING KABBALAH[Images/915904 fgCN01.jpg]In this part . . .Sometimes it’s essential to find out what a topic isn’t before finding out whatit is. Without a doubt, a lot of misconceptions are floating around aboutKabbalah; some have been misleading people for centuries, and others have poppedup more recently. To help you start to really understand Kabbalah and what makesKabbalists tick, this part lets you get some fundamentals under your belt, lookback at the history of Kabbalah, and sweep away some of the big myths that arejust downright distracting."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1WHAT IS KABBALAH?IN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Understanding Kabbalah as a part of Judaismbullet [Images/arrow.png] Delving into some of the major Kabbalistic ideasbullet [Images/arrow.png] Explaining the rules of Kabbalah studybullet [Images/arrow.png] Choosing among different Kabbalah movementsKabbalah is the part of Judaism that deals with the understanding of God,Creation, the relationship between God and God’s Creation, and the nature andway of the soul. Kabbalah is concerned with questions of good and evil, deathand the afterlife, and the spiritual aspects of existence. It’s often describedas Jewish mysticism, but it goes far beyond the mystical aspects of Judaism.Kabbalah is central to Jewish belief and its spiritual practices.Contrary to popular belief, Kabbalah isn’t a book. I’ve heard that commonmisconception time and time again. When I worked in a bookstore years ago, whenI was a librarian, and even in recent days, I’ve been asked if there are anygood translations of the book “Kabbalah.” Some people think that just like youcan study the Bible, you can study the book of Kabbalah. It’s not a book, butits moral, spiritual, and ethical teachings can be found in the great spiritualbooks of the Jewish people.In this chapter, I define the word “Kabbalah,” allow you to get some ofKabbalah’s key concepts under your belt, and explore some of the ways peopletoday are into the subject. But perhaps the most important point that thischapter establishes, and that this book is about, is that Kabbalah is bestunderstood by doing Kabbalah, not just reading about it.GETTING TO KNOW KABBALAH, “THE RECEIVED TRADITION”The word “Kabbalah,” like every Hebrew word, is based on a root. The rootusually consists of three Hebrew letters that serve as the basis for many words.Each root has a primary meaning; the meaning of the root of “Kabbalah” is “toreceive.”What is the person who’s engaged in the study of Kabbalah receiving? The answeris both simple and, in a sense, impossible. Kabbalists receive knowledge of Godand guidance for living.Taking the root meaning a step further, the word “Kabbalah” also means “thereceived tradition.” I once asked one of my teachers how to perform a certainritual. When he explained it to me, I told him that I had heard that it was donedifferently. He replied, “You can do it the other way too, but the way I do itis the way my teacher taught me. That’s my Kabbalah!”Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]In order to receive the tradition of Kabbalah, one must open himself and makeroom within himself so that he’s able to receive the teachings.IS KABBALAH JEWISH MYSTICISM?The biggest myth about Kabbalah, and one that has remarkably snuck into thedefinition of Kabbalah by most writers and teachers who look at Kabbalah fromthe outside, not the inside, is that Kabbalah is Jewish mysticism. As ProfessorJoseph Dan, one of the world’s leading authorities on Kabbalah explains, untilthe 19th century there were no “Jewish mystics.”The term “mysticism” isn’t even a part of Jewish culture or language. The termmysticism was borrowed from a term found in Christian thought, that of uniomystica, the mystical union with God. Some scholars thought that some of thecentral ideas of Kabbalah were parallel to this Christian notion, and so theterm “Jewish mysticism” evolved and attached itself to Kabbalah.For example, one of the primary uses of the term “mysticism” is that itdescribes notions and experiences that can’t be put into words or language.Because Kabbalah stresses that, ultimately, God can’t be described, the use ofthe term “mysticism” became a common one. Mysticism is also used when referringto experiences that are beyond the senses. Here too, because Kabbalah oftendeals with matters of faith, it seems to be useful to say that Kabbalah is“Jewish mysticism.” In this book, I barely use the term “mysticism” because theKabbalistic literature itself never uses it.KABBALAH IS JEWISH THEOLOGYIn a real sense, the history of Kabbalah is the history of Judaism — the twocan’t be separated. Throughout the centuries, the greatest sages of Judaism havebeen serious students of Kabbalah. You may be wondering, “If Kabbalah andJudaism are part of the same thing, what’s the difference between them? Why isthere even a need for the word ‘Kabbalah,’ let alone a book about Kabbalah? Whyisn’t Kabbalah For Dummies simply a book about Judaism?”Throughout this chapter, I explore the idea that Kabbalah is a theologicalprocess central to Judaism. That is, Kabbalah is the way in which Jewishtradition tries to grasp the Infinite and tries to communicate to eachgeneration the ways that the sages have understood that human life — in relationto the creator — should be lived.ASKING LIFE’S ULTIMATE QUESTIONSKabbalah is concerned with life’s ultimate questions. For example, when I lookat the world, I see so much suffering of all kinds, and I’m left to wonder whyGod would have created a world with so much suffering. It often seems that goodpeople suffer and that, too often, people who do evil thrive. The traditionwithin Judaism that deals with such issues and questions is Kabbalistictradition.When people come to realize that life is really a temporary journey and thatlife can end in a painful and difficult way, they’re prompted to ask what thislife is all about and wonder how this seemingly crazy design makes any sense.Kabbalah is the part of Jewish existence and belief that ponders such questionsand offers answers to such immense riddles (see Chapters 5 and 6 for more aboutthis).TAKING ON THE SPIRITUAL LEVEL OF EXISTENCEKabbalah is that part of Judaism that explores the nature of life and the souland the meaning of human existence. It comes into play when people begin toperceive that they aren’t just flesh and blood but seem to have a spirit, aspark of life, an aspect that rocks and minerals don’t have. Kabbalists detectthat the human experience may be profoundly different from that of plants andanimals thanks to free will and one’s consciousness of oneself. Kabbalists alsorealize that, as humans, they not only have bodies that are temporary but alsohave souls that have a greater longevity than physical things.Kabbalah tries to perceive the metaphysics of life and tries to teach people howto use the spiritual forces that exist and how to use them wisely. Kabbalistsnotice that life and human existence seem to contain some working metaphysicalprinciples, in which some things seem good and healthy while others seem bad anddestructive, and in which some things seem to lift humans to sublime heightswhile others seem to degrade human lives.STUDYING KABBALAH: FIRST DO IT, THEN UNDERSTAND ITRemember [Images/Remember.jpg]A fundamental principle among those individuals throughout the centuries whohave lived their lives based on the teachings of Kabbalah is that it’simpossible to grasp these teachings unless you participate in them.Take a kiss, for example. You can read about kissing, study scientific booksabout kissing, understand all the facial muscles needed to form a kiss, and evenwatch Andy Warhol’s film “Kiss,” which has extreme close-ups of people kissing,but the only real way to know — to truly know — about kissing is to kiss!WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]The notion that one can’t have external knowledge of Kabbalah goes back to afamous verse (famous among Kabbalists, that is) found in the Holy Scriptures, inthe book of Exodus. The text describes Moses reading to the people the teachingsthat he received from God on Mount Sinai. Upon hearing the words spoken byMoses, the people said, “All that the Lord spoke we will do and we will hear”(Exodus 24:7). Jewish commentators say that this means, “We will do these thingsfirst, and afterwards we will understand them.”This approach is contrary to what people normally do; often, one first learnssomething and then does it. But not with Kabbalah. To really know Kabbalah, youhave to participate.Nevertheless, a person who wants to learn about Kabbalah can begin to study thesubject without fully jumping in. But out of respect to the subject and in orderto be true to its teachings, the person has to begin by acknowledging thatstudying about Kabbalah without participating in its teachings has itslimitations.Of course, you could say that about practically any activity. For example, youcould learn quite a bit about playing chess without ever playing the gameitself. But true knowledge of chess, or any subject, requires participation.Kabbalah takes this phenomenon seriously, and I feel obligated to make thatpoint clear from the beginning.HEY, WHAT ARE THE BIG IDEAS?You can’t adequately summarize Kabbalah in a few sentences. On the contrary, inKabbalah you have to build ideas, putting them together to form larger ideas.Comparing Kabbalah to math, first you learn how to add and subtract; then youlearn how to multiply and divide. After that, you can start learning simplealgebra, and then you can go on to advanced algebra, and so on.The first, foremost, and central idea of Kabbalah is God. For Kabbalists, by theway, God is hardly a human idea. In fact, a Kabbalist would say that humans arean “idea” of God. How to “know” God is the primary goal of the Kabbalist. On acourse of knowing, or trying to know, God are several key concepts that form thefoundation of Jewish theology, known as Kabbalah.WHY DID GOD CREATE THE WORLD?The question often asked is “Why did God create the world?” The great sages ofKabbalah point out that God surely didn’t create the world because God neededthe world. To say that God needs something implies that there’s some deficiencyin God, and one of Kabbalistic tradition’s fundamental notions about God is thatGod is whole, perfect, flawless, and in need of nothing. By the way, accordingto Kabbalah, God didn’t create the world in one moment and then stop. Rather,Kabbalah teaches that God continues to create the world every moment. Creationis an ongoing divine activity. (For more on this topic, check out Chapter 4.)Why, then, does God create the world? As a gesture of love and because God wantshumans to receive. Kabbalists say that God wants humans to receive the greatestpleasure possible: knowledge of God.“Knowledge of God?” you may be asking. “That’s the greatest pleasure?” Theteachings of Kabbalah emphatically declare that indeed the greatest possiblepleasure is to know God — to really know God.THE POINT OF LIFE IS GETTING TO KNOW GOD, EVEN IF IT’S IMPOSSIBLEKabbalah is the system of beliefs, ideas, and actions contained in Jewishtradition that help people truly know the Divine. If you don’t recognize aproblem at this point, you should. You’ve just collided with a paradox.Now, Kabbalah is filled with paradoxes. A paradox is a statement that appears tocontradict itself. But a paradox isn’t an absurdity; it can contain awesometruths. So, the first paradox to consider is the Kabbalistic view that, althoughthe greatest pleasure is to know God, knowledge of God is impossible.Perhaps it’s more accurate to say that complete knowledge of God is impossible.What Kabbalistic tradition provides are ways to glimpse God, and even a tinyglimpse contains profound pleasure.One of Kabbalah’s primary principles is an unbridgeable gap between God andhumans. Although a person can make contact with God, ultimately this contactcan’t take place solely through the efforts of the person. No matter how hard aperson tries, he or she can’t reach God. Kabbalah teaches that the gap canindeed be crossed, but only by God. When that gap is crossed, it’s because Godreaches out.IT’S ALL ABOUT RECEIVINGGod makes the gesture to reach out to a person, and it’s the person’s job toreceive (remember that “Kabbalah” means “to receive”). The rituals, customs,laws, and activities of the person who lives according to Kabbalistic traditionare intended to prepare that person to receive God, to receive knowledge of God,and to receive the greatest possible pleasure.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalah is the tradition received from the Jewish sages in order to help peopleperceive and live in the fullness of the presence of God.You may say, “Knowledge of God isn’t the greatest pleasure.” Some people thinkthat having lots of money is the greatest pleasure. Others may think that sex isthe greatest pleasure. Still others may feel that fame or food or any number ofthings are among the greatest pleasures of life. But Kabbalah teaches that themost profound source of pleasure is to know God.PREPARING TO KNOW GODHow does one prepare to receive the knowledge of God? Many have taught that thefirst step is to make room for this knowledge. If one is all closed down orfilled up, then knowledge of God has no way to enter and no place to reside.If a person holds on tightly to the ideas and beliefs that he or she currentlyhas, it’s usually impossible to let new ones in. But the biblical view — firstdo and then understand — is a useful approach. There’s no need to do everythingand surely no need to do everything at once, but students of Kabbalah have foundthat by participating in a little study, prayer, and ritual observance, thedoors begin to open, and true learning can take place.A FEW MORE KEY KABBALAH CONCEPTSThe following is a list of other major concepts which require in-depth study inorder to benefit from Kabbalah as a system of daily practices:bullet [Images/check.png] God is infinite: Kabbalah understands God to be aperfect, supreme being who’s infinite and both formless and changeless. You canfind out more about the infinite nature of God in Chapter 16.bullet [Images/check.png] Divine contraction: One of the questions that Kabbalahtries to answer is “If God is infinite, where is there room for God’s creation?”The Kabbalistic term for the process of God contracting in order to make roomfor Creation is tzimtzum (tzim-tzoom). The Kabbalistic view of creation imaginesthat God prompted an absence of the Divine, which resulted in a “space” forcreation to happen.bullet [Images/check.png] Ten utterances: Kabbalah teaches that God creates theworld through the ten utterances, which form, by their infinite combinations,all the detail of existence. These ten utterances are also congruent withanother major concept, the ten sefirot (see Chapter 4).It’s absolutely impossible to study Kabbalah without a grasp of the ten sefirot.The ten sefirot are ten divine powers or channels or flows of divine plenty thatcontinuously create and nourish creation. For the Kabbalist, the mastery of theten sefirot is a major life task and a major tool used to connect with God. Theten sefirot flow downward from God to God’s creation, and human actions send theflow back “up” to the Divine.bullet [Images/check.png] The breaking of the vessels: The Kabbalistic conceptof creation includes shevirat ha-kelim (sheh-vee-raht hah-kay-leem; the breakingof the vessels). Some refer to it as the great catastrophic event that occurredwhen God poured infinite divine light into vessels that were unable to containthis light (see Chapter 5).The shards produced by this shattering are the stuff of creation. The divinelight is embedded within every aspect of creation, and the task of humans is torelease the Divine that resides in all of creation through good deeds, righteousliving, and spiritual acts.bullet [Images/check.png] Tikkun: Following from the notion of the shattering ofthe vessels is the Kabbalistic concept of Tikkun (tee-koon; repair). Tikkun isthe purpose of human existence and the way to come to know God. Instruction forthis repair is found in the Torah and specifically in the mitzvot, which areguidelines for healthy living found in the Torah.bullet [Images/check.png] Halachah: Halachah (hah-lah-khah; the way to walk) isthe sum of the laws and instruction of the Torah that will make the necessaryrepairs. Humans must participate in the repairing of the world and must learnthe proper ways to do so in order to separate good from evil andultimately extinguish the evil that exists in the universe. Every human being isrequired to do his or her part in perfecting of the world (see the chapters inPart III).bullet [Images/check.png] Mitzvot: A mitzvah (mitz-vah) is a divine commandment,and “mitzvot” is the plural form of the word. These commandments are dividedinto two groups: positive commandments describing what one is supposed to do,and negative commandments describing what one is supposed to refrain from doing.For example, giving charity is a positive commandment; “Do not murder” is anegative commandment.Jewish tradition teaches that 613 commandments are found in the Five Books ofMoses. But as it’s taught, this number is deceptive because there are actuallythousands of teachings in Jewish tradition helping us align with our highestpossible selves. All commandments have two purposes: to make people conscious ofGod as the one and only reality and to repair the world. I discuss mitzvot inthe chapters of Part III.bullet [Images/check.png] Everything is for the best: One of the most difficultand profound teachings in all Kabbalistic tradition is the view that everythingthat happens is for the best. (What?? Even the Holocaust? Even the death of aninnocent child?) Kabbalists live in a paradox: On the one hand, people have anobligation to repair the world, to help relieve suffering, to work to advancemedical science, to cure diseases, to fight evil, and to mourn the dead. On theother hand, people have an equal obligation to cultivate the belief thatultimately the world is in God’s hands, God knows what’s happening, andeverything has a purpose beyond anything humans can possibly imagine. For moreon this topic, turn to Chapter 5.bullet [Images/check.png] Souls: Kabbalah teaches that humans live in tworealms: the physical world and the spiritual world. Humans are unique in thisway, being the only creatures that partake of both realms. The human struggle isto make sure that one’s body is the tool or instrument of the soul. The bodyshould be ruled by the spirit. Kabbalah teaches that the soul exists before thebody, and after the body dies, the soul continues on its spiritual journeys —sometimes by being reincarnated into another body in order to have another go atit. I examine the nature of bodies and souls in Chapter 6 and reincarnation inChapter 7.A CONSTANT SEARCH FOR GODThe first thing Kabbalah students learn about God is that God is beyond anyconception that a person can possibly imagine. As one of my teachers taught, ifyou think you grasp God, one thing is certain: You’re wrong. In a sense, theKabbalistic definition of God is that which is beyond any possible humanconception.Nevertheless, Kabbalah teaches that the human task in life is to look for God,reach out to God, and learn from the great spiritual masters of Jewish traditionhow to undertake the search for God. Ultimately, God makes the contact withhumans, but great importance lies in the human effort and reaching.MISSING THE FOREST FOR THE TREESWithin Judaism are seemingly countless practices and rituals — things to do andthings to refrain from doing. To an outsider, these dos and don’ts seem almostlike a petty list of unrelated commands. In fact, many Jews alienate themselvesfrom the practices of Judaism because they seem like such senseless details. Butthe situation can be compared to looking at trees: If you get up close to atree, you see a huge number of little details and details within details.However, if you focus on the details of just one tree, you miss the magnificenceof the forest.The laws of Judaism are deeply connected to Kabbalah. The most well-known andauthoritative Code of Jewish Law was complied by one of the most reveredKabbalists of Jewish history, and many people don’t realize that every page ofthe Code of Jewish Law has a Kabbalistic commentary that spells out thespiritual meaning of each of law.GOD IS IN THE DETAILSFrom awakening each morning until falling asleep, through the course of the day,week, year, and one’s life, the Kabbalistic lifestyle offers countlessopportunities and methods to connect with a consciousness of God.The Kabbalist wants to be aware of God at all times. Kabbalah connects a personto God while eating, working, and doing every other human activity. The goal isto constantly have God in one’s mind and heart because God is the center ofexistence.A Kabbalist defines his or her life as a relationship with God. All otherrelationships, whether they be with friends, partners, parents, children,neighbors, employers, or even Kabbalah teachers, are seen as temporary. The onlypermanent relationship, the only relationship that truly defines who a personis, is the relationship he or she has with God.WHO CAN STUDY KABBALAH?Kabbalah is a Jewish tradition. In fact, Kabbalah is Jewish tradition. Althoughsome have tried to represent Kabbalah as a philosophy or approach to life that’sindependent of Judaism, that simply isn’t accurate. And it’s not onlyinaccurate, it’s impossible.Every great sage of Kabbalah throughout the ages has taught that Kabbalah andJewish tradition are part of the same whole. You can certainly extract ideasfrom Kabbalistic tradition, separating them from anything Jewish, but whatyou’re left holding just isn’t true Kabbalah. Just as a few Buddhist teachingsdon’t represent the rich and ancient tradition of Buddhism, the gathering of afew notions familiar to Kabbalists in past centuries doesn’t make up thetradition of Kabbalah.True, some books written by Jewish teachers and even contemporary rabbisrelegate Kabbalah to some fringe of Jewish history. You can find books writtenby teachers who aren’t Jewish that claim that Kabbalah isn’t a specificallyJewish phenomenon. You also can find books and teachers who claim that one canunderstand Kabbalah and even be a Kabbalist without participating in Jewishlife, rituals, and celebrations.But the simple fact is that Kabbalah is the soul of Jewish life. Every greatKabbalist and authority on Kabbalah for centuries has lived life as a Jewprofoundly involved in Jewish study, Jewish prayer, Jewish ritual, and Jewishlife.DO YOU HAVE TO BE JEWISH?One principle of Kabbalah is that Kabbalah and Jewish law are inextricablylinked. One can’t be a Kabbalist and abandon the guidelines for a Jewish life.Without that flow of rituals and practices, the container necessary for theprofound insights of Kabbalah is simply missing One cannot be a Kabbalist andignore Jewish ritual. To the Kabbalist, Jewish ritual without Kabbalah is anempty shell, and Kabbalah without Jewish practice is incomplete and a meresplinter of something whole and complete.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Of course, you don’t have to be Jewish to study Kabbalah. On the contrary, intoday’s world, the wisdom of the great spiritual traditions is, for the firsttime, universally available. In the past, you may have been able to find a bookhere or there or spend some time with an occasional teacher from a religious orspiritual tradition that wasn’t your own. But now, books, Web sites, and ease oftravel afford the opportunity to encounter the world’s great religious andspiritual traditions. There’s certainly nothing wrong with wanting to nourishoneself at the watering hole of any source of wisdom.It’s also perfectly fine to borrow an idea or integrate a piece of wisdom fromKabbalah (or any tradition, for that matter) into your own life. When someonewho isn’t Jewish approaches Kabbalah, expresses an interest in its wisdom, andeven incorporates that wisdom into his or her life, it’s a natural phenomenon.But it’s important to know that every great Kabbalist, every important book onKabbalah, and every law, ritual, or practice of Kabbalah that exists comes fromJews who are speaking to Jews. Kabbalah and Judaism are unlike some religioustraditions that teach that everyone needs to believe what they believe andunlike many spiritual traditions or teachers who think they have a monopoly onwisdom and truth. Kabbalah is a legacy of the spiritual tradition of the Jewishpeople, and central to the spiritual culture of the Jewish family.CAN AN ATHEIST BE A KABBALIST?Although Kabbalah is primarily concerned with the human relationship to God,there’s nothing inappropriate about someone who’s a nonbeliever, or even aconfirmed atheist, spending time trying to grasp the basic ideas of Kabbalah.A well-known statement made to atheists is, “The God that you don’t believe in,well, I don’t believe in that God either.” In other words, a person may statethat he or she is a nonbeliever, but when a believer explores just what it isthat the nonbeliever doesn’t believe in, the believer finds that he or she alsodoesn’t believe in that conception of God.Some people grow up with an image of God as a man with a beard sitting on aheavenly throne. Others grow up with an idea of God as an angry, vengeful,strict dictator who punishes people with fire and brimstone. All kinds of ideasabout God float around; humans are inherently seekers, and Kabbalists arefull-time God seekers. But these conceptions of God all too often chase peopleaway from God, and result in a wholesale rejection of the study of religion.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]My teacher points out that many people who claim to be atheists are really notatheists at all. They simply reject old-fashioned and inaccurate views of God.They may not believe in an angry God or a vengeful God or the old man on theheavenly throne God, but they may have more in common with the Kabbalist and hisor her beliefs about the “unknowable God” than they might think (see Chapter 16for more on God as unknowable).DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF KABBALAHUntil recently historians, including some Jewish historians, have been downrighthostile to Kabbalah, claiming that it belongs in the folklore department or asis mere superstition. Some have gone as far as to completely ignore Kabbalistictradition in their writings.WHAT IS THE TORAH?The answer to that question isn’t simple, but it’s surely worth exploring and isactually crucial to an understanding of Kabbalah itself.The Hebrew word “Torah” has the same root as the Hebrew word hora’ah(hoe-rah-ah; instruction or teaching), and “Torah” is used in a number of ways.bullet [Images/check.png] Torah is the Five Books of Moses, the writtenrevelation that Moses received from God at Mount Sinai. Although one can findthe text (called the Chumash [choo-mahsh; five]) today in printed book form, itmost commonly appears in the form of a hand-written scroll of ink on parchmentthat’s found in the sanctuaries of synagogues throughout the world.bullet [Images/check.png] Torah is the Holy Scriptures of the Jewish people.Outside of the Jewish world, these Holy Scriptures are sometimes referred to asthe Pentateuch (five books), or the Jewish Scriptures, and sometimes the term“Old Testament” is used by those who imply a New Testament has supplanted theoriginal.bullet [Images/check.png] Torah is the term used to refer to the entire body ofJewish spiritual literature, including well-known works such as the Talmud andthe Zohar as well as the thousands of other works written by Jewish spiritualteachers throughout the centuries. A seeker who says that he or she is studyingTorah may mean the study of any work of Jewish literature that continues theendless chain of religious tradition growing out of the original revelation atMount Sinai.bullet [Images/check.png] Torah is what a Jewish spiritual teacher rooted intradition teaches tomorrow. This interpretation of the word “Torah” reflects thetraditional Jewish belief that Torah is timeless, eternal wisdom.Throughout the ages, books that have been written by great sages sooner or laterjoin the chain of Torah literature. These works don’t become a part of thatchain through a vote but rather by their wide acceptance among the Jewish peoplein general and the sages in particular.In other words, regardless of whether the Zohar was written in the secondcentury by the Talmudic sage Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai or in the 12th century byRabbi Moses de Leon, the important fact is that every Kabbalist who ever livedstudies the Zohar, studies commentaries on the Zohar, and in doing so connectswith the chain of people who recognize the Zohar as an important Kabbalistictext.The study of Kabbalah during the past century has been dominated by aca- demics.(In the 20th century, the academic study of Kabbalah has centered around thework of Professor Gershom Sholem whose work has dominated the field fordecades.) Academics often focus upon questions of history, such as “Who wrotethis or that book?” or “Who influenced whom?” In addition, it’s a generalopinion that many of the academics who have studied and written about Kabbalahin recent generations have done so as scientists (from a secular perspective),not as active participants in the religious tradition of Judaism. The weaknessof this approach, of course, is that Kabbalah, as I indicate earlier in thischapter, can’t be adequately understood from the outside.Traditional Jews generally aren’t as interested in a scientific, scholarly studyof Kabbalah. Rather, for the Kabbalist who is immersed in a traditionalreligious life, Kabbalah fits unconditionally into the timeless unfolding ofGod’s revelation.A closer look at the different ways in which Kabbalah is approached dependingone’s bias can be illustrated by the question, “Who wrote the Zohar?” The Zohar,which I cover in Chapter 13, is probably the most well-known and important bookof Kabbalistic teachings. Here are three different approaches to answering thatquestion:bullet [Images/check.png] Traditionalists claim that the Zohar was written byRabbi Shimon bar Yochai, a sage who lived in the second century and who’s saidto have written the book during the 13 years he spent in a cave hiding from theRomans. Many centuries of Kabbalists have accepted this view that the Zohar waswritten by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai.bullet [Images/check.png] Academic scholars say that the Zohar was written byRabbi Moses de Leon in the 12th century. These scholars compare the writingstyle of the Zohar to other writing of Rabbi Moses de Leon and use additionalacademic tools to draw their conclusions. They reject the traditionalistapproach.bullet [Images/check.png] Mainly in the traditionalist camp but with a slightlydifferent approach are those who don’t care about questions of history too muchand don’t really know whether the author of the Zohar was Rabbi Moses de Leon orRabbi Shimon bar Yochai or someone else. People who follow this approach simplyjoin the countless students of Kabbalah throughout the centuries who study theZohar without questioning its source and participate in a Kabbalisticexploration of life.The study of Kabbalah is the study of timeless and eternal wisdom. Kabbalah isgrounded in a part of a more general notion that Kabbalists call Torah (in thesense that a generic meaning of the word Torah is “instruction.” As long asthere has been a notion of Kabbalah, there has been “the study of Torah.”Basically, anyone who is studying Kabbalah is actually a student of Torah and,in fact, would be more apt to state that he or she is a student of Torah than astudent of Kabbalah.PICKING A KABBALAH THAT WORKS FOR YOUIn the year 70 CE, a cataclysm of vast proportions occurred in Jewish history.The destruction of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem by the Roman Empire stillreverberates in Jewish life today. One of the results of this terrible event wasthe end of any central authority among the Jewish people.With the destruction of the Temple came the end of the highest court in Jewishlife, the Sanhedrin. This court, which was similar to the Supreme Court of theUnited States but with far more authority, decided major issues for the Jewishcommunity worldwide. Among its powers was the authority to ordain rabbis. Sincethe fall of the Sanhedrin, there has been no accepted singular authority withinJewish life.As a result, controversies within Jewish communal life went unresolved, splitsoccurred, differences of opinion and differing approaches proliferated, andsignificant disagreements on all kinds of matters arose. For example, Jewishlife in the United States today contains four different movements representing,in some cases, vastly different beliefs.Not only does Judaism have four major movements — Orthodox, Conservative,Reconstructionist, and Reform — but each movement is divided into differentdivisions. For instance, within the Orthodox world, one finds Hasidic Jews andnon-Hasidic Jews. And the newest movement within Jewish life, Jewish Renewal,defines itself in part as a worldwide, transdenominational movement grounded inJudaism’s prophetic and mystical traditions.Note: In this book, I draw heavily upon Hasidism because the Hasidic movementhas been, for the past few centuries, the great popularizer of Kabbalah andbecause it is within the Hasidic world today that the most complete form ofKabbalah is practiced. In addition, Hasidism is the most rapidly growingmovement in the Jewish world, and its influence on all the other movements isclear and significant. While Hasidism is a major influence on the othermovements, the opposite is not true: Hasidism is not being influenced by theother movements.Today, those who want to pursue the study of Kabbalah have many optionsavailable.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]A person who wants to study Kabbalah need not become a member of the Hasidiccommunity or the Jewish Renewal world or pursue the offerings of the KabbalahCentre or a university course. Many available books written for laypeople andscholars can contribute to a deep understanding of the Kabbalistic way. Nothing,however, is better than locating an authentic teacher (see Chapter 14) andbecoming a student of both the theory and practice of Kabbalah.HASIDISMFounded by Rabbi Israel (known as the Baal Shem Tov; see Chapter 18) in theearly 18th century, Hasidism (khah -sid-ism) is a movement within Jewish lifethat seeks to bring the wisdom of Kabbalah to the masses. (The word “hasid”means pious one.) Hasidism began with its leader and his disciples, but over thegenerations, the movement has splintered into many Hasidic groups, each led by aleader known as a rebbe (reh -bee; spiritual mentor).Usually, when a rebbe dies, his son, son-in-law, or another person selected bythe rebbe or the community to succeed him becomes the spiritual guide of thegroup. Today, many Hasidic groups have headquarters or branches throughout theworld, but many are found in Israel and New York City.The Hasidic group most open to and even encouraging of newcomers is commonlyknown as either Chabad (khah-bahd ), which is an acronym of three importantterms in Kabbalah (see Chapter 3) or Lubavitch (loo-bah -vitch), after the townin Russia where the movement flowered generations ago. The lifestyles,practices, rituals, and beliefs of Chasidim today most resemble those ofKabbalists throughout the centuries.ORTHODOX (NON-HASIDIC) JUDAISMWhereas Kabbalah is openly studied in Hasidic communities, many peoplemistakenly think that non-Hasidic Orthodox Jews don’t study Kabbalah. Actually,the average Orthodox Jew is discouraged from serious study of Kabbalah, but themost brilliant students usually are encouraged to delve into the teachings ofKabbalah. Regardless, most Orthodox Jews participate in many Kabbalistic ritualseven though they may be unaware that the rituals originated among Kabbalists.More important, essentially, the basic theology accepted by Orthodox Jews isKabbalah, although again many Orthodox Jews are unaware of its Kabbalisticroots.JEWISH RENEWALJewish Renewal was founded in 1962 by Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi (also knownas Reb Zalman), a traditionally trained Chasidic rabbi, and led by anorganization called the Aleph Alliance for Jewish Renewal.At the heart of Jewish Renewal is the notion that the generation following thedestruction of European Jewry, when one out of every three Jews in the world wasmurdered during the Holocaust, is a rebuilding generation. One way to rebuild,of course, is to mimic the old ways and try to duplicate what was lost. Thisapproach has been referred to as restorative.Reb Zalman’s approach to rebuilding is a radical one: Rather than restoreJudaism to the old ways, he suggested a renewal of Judaism. That is, he calledfor a Judaism that understands the essences of the timeless teachings and iswilling to find new forms of expression for those teachings in a language andstyle that fits with more modern sensibilities. One major trend in JewishRenewal, for example, is egalitarianism, in which gender roles are obliteratedand both genders have equal access to communal roles and ritual practices.The Aleph Alliance for Jewish Renewal describes itself as the core institutionin the Jewish Renewal movement. In addition to its publications, conferences,and classes, Aleph trains and ordains Jewish Renewal rabbis, cantors andRabbinic pastors many of whom draw heavily upon Kabbalistic teachings. Althoughthe vast majority of its members as well as those who affiliate with JewishRenewal in one way or another (taking classes, attending conferences, readingits literature, and so on.) don’t not lead traditional Jewish lifestyles andaren’t usually participating in the formal requirements of Jewish law, manyindividuals who are connected in one way or another with Jewish Renewal findthemselves increasingly involved with traditional Jewish practices normal to thelife of a traditional Kabbalist.Jewish Renewal has inspired many gifted teachers and has ordained many JewishRenewal rabbis who are devoted to grasping the teachings of Kabbalah andintegrating these teachings into their lives and the lives of their students.Dozens of Jewish Renewal communities of varying sizes and levels of Jewishobservance exist throughout the world.THE KABBALAH CENTREThe Kabbalah Centre was founded in 1969 by Rabbi Philip Berg, author of manyintroductory books on Kabbalah, and his wife Karen.Drawing upon the wisdom of Kabbalah, the Kabbalah Centre and its teachers havegenerated a program of publishing and classes that urge Jews and others to drinkfrom the waters of Kabbalistic tradition.The Kabbalah Centre has received much publicity in recent years, due in largepart to several high-profile celebrities (most notably the singer and actressMadonna) who have affiliated with the Kabbalah Centre and allow it to be knownthat they are students of Rabbi Berg and his disciples.UNIVERSITY AND GENERAL STUDYMost major universities have Jewish studies departments, and an increasingnumber of those departments offer courses in Kabbalah. Of course, these classesare directed at neither the believer nor the practitioner. As I explain earlierin this chapter, from a Kabbalistic viewpoint, the limitation of an academicstudy of Kabbalah is that Kabbalah is bound up in the practice of Kabbalah.Nevertheless, many excellent scholars have written books on various aspects ofKabbalah that surely aid the sincere student in an understanding of whatKabbalah is all about. Notable among these scholars are Joseph Dan and MosheIdel, each of whom have contributed tremendous understanding of Kabbalah tothose who dedicate themselves to studying their work."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2MAGIC, MISHEGAS, AND OTHER THINGS THAT KABBALAH ISN’TIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Separating out fact from fictionbullet [Images/arrow.png] Staying alert to less-than-qualified Kabbalah teachersI once attended a Jewish history lecture, and the speaker said, “Kabbalah isjust mishegas” (pronounced mih-shih-gahs; a Yiddish word for craziness). ButKabbalah has gotten a bad rap, starting with the word “Kabbalah” itself. TheEnglish word “cabal” comes from the word “Kabbalah” and is defined as a secretclique that seeks power usually through intrigue. The word “cabal,” by the way,was popularized in England around 1673 as a handy acronym for five ministers ofKing Charles II (Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale) whowere seen as a threat to the power of the throne and the monarchy. So forcenturies, the word “cabal” has influenced the popular image of Kabbalah; peopleoften think of Kabbalah as some kind of secretive philosophy of the Jews, butthere’s really no truth to that.More people have learned about the word “Kabbalah” in the last few years thanever before, thanks in part to various famous personalities who’ve taken up thestudy of Kabbalah, but that doesn’t mean that everything you hear about Kabbalahis true. In this chapter, I explain what Kabbalah isn’t as a way of clarifyingwhat it actually is.SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHTKabbalah has been misunderstood and distorted over the years for many reasons,including the following:bullet [Images/check.png] Until the 1700s, Kabbalah was mainly studied by a fewelite scholars. Everyone else had to speculate about it.bullet [Images/check.png] Beginning in the 1500s, Christian scholars borrowedcertain concepts and terms from Kabbalah and superimposed Christian theologyonto it, resulting in what’s often referred to as Christian Cabala.bullet [Images/check.png] The study of alchemy borrowed some concepts fromKabbalah. As alchemy received its share of criticism and skepticism, so didKabbalah.bullet [Images/check.png] As with the sciences in general, there is a risk whena pure science is popularized. The popularization of most subjects usually endsup with lots of distortions.bullet [Images/check.png] Kabbalah speculates about metaphysical rather thanphysical matters, and metaphysical matters are often rejected and scorned byrationalists. Many modern, so-called “rational” thinkers are embarrassed by suchspeculations.So with all these factors contributing to the misunderstanding of Kabbalah, Iwant to take some time to set the record straight (or a least set it straighter)on what Kabbalah is and what it isn’t.THE LONG WAY IS SHORTERSome people prefer to go to Kabbalistic texts to grab at esoteric, practicaltechniques in order to get a quick spiritual fix, while avoiding the demandingdisciplines and commitments that authentic Kabbalah requires. This distortionhas resulted in many people thinking that Kabbalah is really all about magic,prolonged sessions of silent meditation, chanting Hebrew words for long periodsof time, and wearing good luck charms. These techniques certainly aren’tnonexistent in Jewish history, but if you want to learn about Kabbalah, they arethe wrong places to look to build a foundation for your spiritual practice.Many masters of Kabbalah have pointed to a profound teaching that is found inthe Talmud that “the short way is longer” and “the long way is shorter.” Inother words, when you want to take a shortcut, you often get lost. But the triedand true long way actually ends up being shorter than the short way. Too manymodern seekers hope for a shortcut and never really get on the Kabbalistic path.It’s my hope that this book will serve you well and will provide a strongfoundation if you want to further your study of Kabbalah.WHAT KABBALAH ISN’TBecause you’re going to be dealing with the “isn’t” part of Kabbalah more oftenthan not, at least at first, you need to know the following:bullet [Images/check.png] Kabbalah isn’t pop psychology or New Age philosophy.bullet [Images/check.png] Kabbalah isn’t superstition, a collection of secretformulas, or a bunch of mystical incantations.bullet [Images/check.png] Kabbalah isn’t a fad. Though it may seem like onebecause of the sudden rise in popularity and exposure, it’s actually been aroundand developing for thousands of years.bullet [Images/check.png] Kabbalah isn’t an easy path to the eternal bliss orenlightenment.WHAT KABBALAH ISNow that you have a better understand of what Kabbalah isn’t, it’s probably agood time to summarize what Kabbalah is. Kabbalah isbullet [Images/check.png] The theology of the Jewish peoplebullet [Images/check.png] The study of the ways the great sages of Judaismunderstand how the universe worksbullet [Images/check.png] An exploration of the most profound wisdom of Jewishtraditionbullet [Images/check.png] The abstract understanding of the meaning and purposeof life according to Jewish traditionbullet [Images/check.png] The Jewish speculations about God and God’srelationship with Creationbullet [Images/check.png] The abstract underpinning of Jewish lawbullet [Images/check.png] The explanations of the meaning and purpose of Jewishritual practicebullet [Images/check.png] The study the Jewish tradition that describes thebuilding blocks of creationbullet [Images/check.png] The Jewish study of the unseen laws that govern theuniversebullet [Images/check.png] The Jewish understanding of the structure and workingsof the human soulTRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO’S LEGIT AND WHO’S NOTIn the world of Kabbalah, there are individuals and groups who representthemselves as teachers of Kabbalah but whose authenticity and motives arequestionable. Kabbalah has drifted into the hands of some of the snake oilpeddlers of the world because Kabbalah has been distorted into a quick-fixtechnique. A quick and easy road to enlightenment is a perfect commodity forcharlatans to try to sell. Separating legitimate students and teachers from therest isn’t an easy task, but allow me to try to give you some advice andguidance.In the long run, I believe that providing you with some advice for how to goabout making your own evaluation of Kabbalists is more useful that rattling offa list of names I do or don’t endorse. The following points are actually basedon the advice of one of my teachers. Here’s what to look for and what to avoid.A teacher should havebullet [Images/check.png] A broad and deep knowledge of the subjectbullet [Images/check.png] Humility and the ability to say “I don’t know.” (Myteacher taught me to run away quickly when a teacher seems to know every answerto every question.) Sometimes the best teachers are reluctant teachers, and theconverse is also often true: A teacher who is too eager to teach may havequestionable motives like ego needs and the lust for power and authority. Ibelieve that any evidence to the contrary be a real red flag for a seekerlooking for a Kabbalah teacher.bullet [Images/check.png] Generosity, which, for a teacher, is the love ofgiving and sharingbullet [Images/check.png] Empathy, which is the ability to reach students onvarious different levels. There is a traditional title for a certain kind ofJewish teacher known as the Maggid (mah-geed), which is often translated asstoryteller. The title is actually reserved for the teacher and storyteller whois able to reach students with differing levels of knowledge and understand atthe same time. A Maggid can teach a class and everyone, regardless of his or herlevel, thinks that the teacher is directing the lesson to him or her.bullet [Images/check.png] Insight, not just information. It’s easy to think thata teacher who knows Hebrew, for example, or who knows a lot of terms that areunfamiliar is a master of the subject.Warning(bomb) [Images/Warning(bomb).jpg]Beware of people who like to put others down. One of the great Kabbalists of the20th century, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, who was also the first Chief Rabbi ofmodern Israel, warned that there are two ways for people to raise themselves up:to actually work hard (the only way) or to put down those around them (thereprehensible way). Also beware of the teacher who thinks that he or she has amonopoly on wisdom.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]One doesn’t have to be an expert in order to be a teacher. On the contrary,everyone has the responsibility to share what they know with others. Sometimes,one little piece of wisdom can change someone’s entire life, but it’s also truethat one could take a class from a leading scholar and sit for hours, if notweeks, without picking up a thing. A Kabbalist is seeker, and the true seekerlooks for wisdom everywhere. (For more on finding a good Kabbalah teacher, flipto Chapter 14.)AN UNLIKELY TEACHERFor a number of years, I visited New York City’s Central Park regularly andwould sit for hours by the small lake near the Hans Christian Andersen statues.At the time, it was a relatively quiet part of the park and therefore ideal forpeaceful meditation and contemplation. One day, I noticed a man nearby engagedin needlepoint. He created remarkable tapestries based on classic and well-knownpaintings, and he did it all freehand. People wandered by in awe of this man’sgift and the exquisite items that he made. He was a street person who woretattered clothes and spent his nights in doorways around the city. His skin hungon thin bones, and he clearly looked like he had weathered many unsheltered daysand nights. I often heard people offering to purchase his creations, but healways refused, explaining that he had made a promise never to sell any of hiswork but rather to give it all to a local church that often provided him withfood, clothing, and other necessities.I would sit next to this man and watch him work, supplying him with silk threadand even visiting Chinatown to buy him dozens of spools of thread of allthicknesses and shades of color.I mention him because he was, in my opinion, one of the wisest and mostbrilliant people I’ve ever encountered. He didn’t look the part, but almosteverything he said, whether to me or to passersby, was deep and profound andwise. He had no degrees or credentials, and he didn’t even have a roof over hishead, and yet somehow he was one of the most special souls I’ve ever met. Hedidn’t write articles or books, and he wasn’t affiliated with any institution,but he taught his class each day on that park bench to anyone fortunate enoughto discover him and quiet down enough to hear his words."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3LOOKING BACK: A BRIEF HISTORY OF KABBALAHIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Revealing Kabbalah’s roots in the Biblebullet [Images/arrow.png] Getting to know history’s greatest Kabbalistsbullet [Images/arrow.png] Understanding the way Kabbalah manifests in moderntimesThere’s no beginning when it comes to the history of Kabbalah. As the traditionteaches, “Nine hundred and seventy-four generations before the world wascreated, the Torah had already been written.” And as the Zohar teaches, “Godlooked into the Torah and created the world.”Kabbalah is the deepest level of Torah, which is the spiritual way of Judaism;it’s the theology that holds up the entire spiritual tradition of Judaism. Putsimply, Kabbalah is the heart and soul of Judaism.Although Kabbalah doesn’t have a beginning, one can trace its path throughhistory starting with the book of books, the Holy Scriptures, and beginning withthe opening chapters, which introduce the first human. Many biblical figureshave great significance in the history of Kabbalah. In this chapter, the firstthing I do is focus on the most important ones in the history of Kabbalah: Adam,Abraham, and Moses.When the Holy Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed in the first decades of thefirst millennia CE, an important event that followed was the writing of theTalmud and other Rabbinic texts. This chapter introduces you to the two mostimportant Kabbalists in the Rabbinic period: Rabbi Akiva, the extraordinary sagein the Talmud, and Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, traditionally thought of as theauthor of the Zohar.After the Rabbinic period, which ended about 500 CE, the next significantdevelopment in the history of Kabbalah was the 13th-century revelation of theZohar, the great Kabbalistic text of Judaism. And then, a few centuries later,the brief life of the greatest Kabbalist of all time, Rabbi Isaac Luria (theAri), changed the course of Kabbalah and Judaism forever.In this chapter, you also meet the infamous Kabbalist, Shabtai Tzvi, whosereputation went from the greatest heights down to the depths, and you delve intothe Hasidic movement, the great revival that brought Kabbalah to Jewseverywhere. Finally, I tell you where Kabbalah is happening right at thismoment.Note: Many outstanding figures in addition to the ones I focus on in thischapter make up the history of Kabbalah. Knowledge of Kabbalah has been spreadby so many outstanding scholars throughout history, such as Rabbi Judah, knownas the Maharal of Prague (1512–1609), Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz (1565–1630), RabbiMoshe Hayyim Luzzatto (1707–1746), and Rabbi Elijah the Gaon of Vilna(1720–1797), to name a few.KABBALISTS IN THE BIBLEThere are many biblical figures who are profoundly important to the history ofJewish spiritual thought and therefore to Kabbalah. Abraham’s grandson, Jacob,for example, wrestles with an angel and becomes “Israel.” And King David writesmost of the book of Psalms and, in doing so, reveals his extraordinary personalrelationship with God.But Adam, Abraham, and Moses occupy the top three Kabbalistic spots when I lookat the biblical period. Adam represents every person; Abraham is such an amazingvisionary that he became a central figure in three world religions; and Moses isregarded in Jewish tradition as the greatest teacher who ever lived and whoreached greater intimacy with God than anyone before or since.ADAM: FIRST MAN, FIRST KABBALISTAdam, the Bible’s first human, is also considered to be the first Kabbalist.Kabbalists have a traditional belief that a book containing the wisdom ofKabbalah was delivered by an angel to Adam.Adam is significant to Kabbalists for another reason. Many Kabbalists havetended to focus on a few specific areas of the Torah more than others, and oneof those areas is the story of creation in the book of Genesis. Kabbalistsanalyze each and every detail of the story — not only the words but also theletters that make up the words that tell the story of God’s creation of theworld and Adam and Eve. For Kabbalists, the tale of Adam and Eve is emblematicof human life, and the deepest mysteries of creation and the human situation arecontained within the details of the language of the Torah.Kabbalists are particularly interested inbullet [Images/check.png] The significance of the notion that Adam was split intwo to create male and female: In Kabbalistic tradition, the institution ofmarriage is seen as the primary cell of social existence; in deeper, morespiritual terms, marriage is seen as a holy act in which two halves cometogether to make one whole. This basic and sacred combination of male and femalewas designed by God and has the ability to produce life. The profoundrelationship between left and right and the principle of two halves forming awhole are major topics in an understanding of the ten sefirot (see Chapter 4).That male and female come together to form one whole unit is a basic principleof life itself for the Kabbalist.bullet [Images/check.png] Adam’s relationship to the trees in the garden,planted by God and described in some detail: Early in the book of Genesis is thestory of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The garden, says the text, had manytrees, most notably the Tree of Life, which was in the middle of the garden, andthe Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Kabbalists study these details and thestories that contain them in an effort to understand some of the most profoundprinciples of life. What is evil? What is temptation? How can one overcometemptation? What is the relationship between free will and temptation? One themefound in the teachings of many Kabbalists that’s reflected in the biblicalverses about Adam in the garden is this: Sometimes eating from the tree ofknowledge actually has the reverse effect and knowledge actually gets in the wayof true knowing.bullet [Images/check.png] Adam’s relationship to the snake in the Garden ofEden: The snake, known in Hebrew as nochosh (noh-khosh), is often seen as asymbol of the evil inclination, the tempter, and is sometimes even referred toas the suhtun (suh-ton), from which the word “Satan” comes. In the Torah, thesnake’s punishment is having to eat the dust of the earth forever. Kabbalistssometimes interpret dust as the sins of humans, implying that evil in the worldis fed by the misdeeds that humans commit. Kabbalists believe that evil isn’tsomething that lives on its own, but rather they view evil as a parasite thatlives off of the errors of humankind.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalistic tradition views Adam as a unique entity. He isn’t just thebiological ancestor of all humans; he’s also the spiritual ancestor. Kabbalistsbelieve that the soul in each person is really a fragment of one great soul —that of Adam, known among Kabbalists as Adam HaRishon (ah -dum hah-ree -shone,the first human.) Another Kabbalistic term, Adam Kadmon (ah -dum kahd -mun), isalso frequently used and is translated as Primordial Man, the first being thatever emerged from creation. (For more on Adam, see Chapter 18.)APPRECIATING ABRAHAM AND HIS KABBALISTIC CONTRIBUTIONSThe patriarch Abraham lived approximately 4,000 years ago. Abraham taught andreminded the world that there is a God and that God is One. This view of God isessential to the Kabbalist, who doesn’t believe that any human being is or couldbe a God, nor does a Kabbalist see the world as created, controlled, orinfluenced by a number of gods. Kabbalists believe in a fundamental oneness, aholy “one” that’s unique, that’s different from any other oneness, and is beyondhuman grasp and the source of all things.Abraham’s teachings had far-reaching influence; both Christian and Islamictraditions also look to the teachings and lineage of Abraham.WHAT DID ABRAHAM DO FOR KABBALAH?Kabbalistic tradition holds that Abraham wrote one of the fundamental books ofKabbalah, Sefer Yetzirah (say -fehr yih-tzee -rah; the Book of Formation).Abraham is also the source of many profound teachings contained in the legends,stories, and laws that have been passed down through the generations and wereultimately revealed by Moses in the form of the written Torah and the OralTradition.So did Abraham actually write Sefer Yetzirah? Did he truly receive a Kabbalistictradition from Adam and then pass it on to his children and grandchildren andtheir descendents? For the Kabbalist, the answer is surely “yes.” And remember,that on the most profound level, Kabbalists live in the eternal present. Infact, serious Kabbalists throughout the centuries experienced the patriarchAbraham not as a myth or even as an historical figure but rather as a being inthe eternal present. A tangible example of this belief is the holiday of Sukkot(sue-coat; see Chapter 11), when one of the fundamental rituals is invitingAbraham and other ancestors to sit with the Kabbalist and to study the Torah andbreak bread with him or her.ABRAHAM = LOVINGKINDNESSAbraham represents Chesed, one of the ten sefirot (see Chapter 4). Abraham isthe individual in Kabbalistic tradition who best represents the qualities ofChesed: lovingkindness, hospitality, generosity, affection, openness, andexpansiveness. In today’s Kabbalistic circles, a complimentary way to describesomeone is as a ba’al chesed (bahl keh-sed; a master of Chesed, an expert atlovingkindness).ABRAHAM’S REPUTATION AND ONGOING IMPORTANCEAbraham is well known among Kabbalists as a man who experienced ten severe andbitter trials. One of the questions that Kabbalists confront is the question ofwhy there’s so much suffering in the world, and Abraham is emblematic of suchsuffering. The ten trials of Abraham are symbolic of the trials that all peopleface in life.Kabbalah scholars have long poured over the details of Abraham’s life asrecorded in the Torah as well as other Rabbinic literature. For example, oneepisode in the Torah describes the command that Abraham received from God tosacrifice his son Isaac on an altar on a mountain. This story, known as theBinding of Isaac, takes on profound meaning when studied through a Kabbalisticlens. Kabbalists have written about the Binding of Isaac as a deep explorationof two of the fundamental forces in the universe: Chesed (loving-kindness) andGevurah (restraint) (see Chapter 4). For the Kabbalist, the entire Bible hasmany layers of meaning, but because Abraham represents one of the fundamentalforces in the universe, he gets particularly close examination when Kabbalistspour over the holy books.MOSES: THE GREATEST TEACHER WHO EVER LIVEDMoses lived approximately 3,400 years ago. Kabbalists consider him the greatestprophet and teacher who ever lived as well as the humblest of men.It’s generally believed that the mystical-esoteric tradition that came to becalled Kabbalah has its roots in the transmission of wisdom that begins withAdam and works its way on to Abraham and then on to the generation of Moses. Butwhen the Children of Israel arrived at Mount Sinai, Moses ascended and receiveda unique and great transmission from the Divine that ultimately included allhuman knowledge, including all the details of Kabbalistic tradition.RECEIVING THE TORAH AT MOUNT SINAIMoses is probably most famous for leading the Children of Israel out of slaveryin Egypt, through the desert for 40 years, and eventually into the PromisedLand. However, another important story sheds additional light on why Moses is soimportant to Kabbalah.The story, as recorded in the Talmud, describes Moses going up Mount Sinai andfinding God in the midst of writing the Torah. Moses looked at the scroll thatGod was writing and saw many things that he couldn’t understand. God told himthat one day a great man named Rabbi Akiva would understand all the things thatMoses couldn’t understand and would be able to teach these things to hisstudents. As the story goes, Moses asked God if he could meet Rabbi Akiva. Godasked Moses to turn around, and suddenly Moses found himself sitting in RabbiAkiva’s classroom.As Moses sat in Rabbi Akiva’s classroom many centuries later, he found that hecouldn’t understand what the teacher was teaching. One student asked, “From whomdo we learn these secret traditions found in the Torah scroll?” To Moses’sastonishment, Rabbi Akiva replied, “We received these secret traditions fromMoses, who received them at Mount Sinai.This sense of history, that in some inexplicable way everyone can live in theeternal present, transforms Moses from a man who lived in one era of historyinto one with whom Kabbalists can live in the eternal present. For the seriousKabbalist, the voice of Moses spoken both through the text he left in the FiveBooks of Moses and in the countless Oral Traditions that Kabbalists recognize ascoming through him at Mount Sinai is part of the tradition that existed beforethe world began.An ancient text known as the Sayings of the Fathers can be found in everytraditional prayer book and is traditionally read during the afternoon of theSabbath each week. The opening words of the text are Moshe kibel Torah mi’Sinai(moe -sheh kee -bail toe -rah meh-see- nye; Moses received the Torah at Sinai).The words “kibel” (received) and “Kabbalah” are grammatical forms of the sameHebrew term. This relationship ties into the idea of Kabbalah as the receivedtradition, which I explain in Chapter 1.GIFTS FROM MOSESKabbalists believe that the tradition Moses received at Mount Sinai and passedalong contains both a written form and an oral form. Kabbalists view the writtenTorah as the body of the divine teachings from God to Moses. and the soul ofthose teachings resides in the Oral Tradition. Moses passed down from MountSinai both the written Torah and the Oral Tradition, which contains theKabbalistic tradition.Kabbalah today consists of those same two elements received from God and MountSinai:bullet [Images/check.png] The esoteric spiritual ideas, the theology taught byKabbalahbullet [Images/check.png] The Commandments, the basic rituals that help theKabbalist connect with God and that God has commandedKABBALAH IN THE RABBINIC PERIODThe writings produced during the Rabbinic period (the early centuries of theCommon Era) by the many great sages who lived then are concerned largely withlaw. The Talmud was the creative scholarship of the great rabbis of the Rabbinicperiod and grew out of the Mishnah (mish-nah ), which is the written form of theOral Tradition from Mount Sinai (see Chapter 13). The rabbinic texts are alsofilled with practical wisdom, morality tales, science, and more. But certainparticular Rabbinic personalities were especially interested in theology and anabstract understanding of the relationship between humans and God. In theRabbinic period, the study and cultivation of both the written and oraltraditions was in a powerful and active stage. The Talmudic sages Rabbi Akiva,the son of Joseph, and Rabbi Shimon, the son of Yochai, were pivotalpersonalities in the history of Kabbalah.RABBI AKIVA: A SPIRITUAL TEACHER TO THE LAST MOMENTRabbi Akiva was a master of Kabbalah and the leading rabbi of his generation.He’s known in Rabbinic tradition as the rabbi of his time who entered thedeepest depths of spiritual exploration and managed it all without trouble. Hiscolleagues weren’t able to cope with the deepest mysteries of tradition, butRabbi Akiva is the example of the spiritual explorer who was able to grasp thewisdom of Kabbalah in its entirety.Kabbalists have been intimately familiar with the dramatic record of the storyof Rabbi Akiva’s death for nearly 2,000 years. A great teacher of Torah, RabbiAkiva was such a role model to his generation that people considered his mostmundane actions to be part of what they considered to be Torah. Teaching Torahwas illegal under the oppressive Roman rule after the destruction of the HolyTemple in Jerusalem, yet Rabbi Akiva taught Torah and was arrested for it, putinto prison, and ultimately tortured to death.Rabbinic tradition records that while the Romans were raking his flesh with hotiron combs and torturing him to death, his students wept, but Rabbi Akivaoffered a teaching. As his flesh was burning, Rabbi Akiva taught that each day,in prayer, people read the passages from the Torah that refer to their love ofGod. Rabbi Akiva said that he always wondered at the meaning of the Torah text“to love God with all your soul.” He explained that he always understood thispassage to mean that “even at that moment when God has decided to separate mybody from my soul, I will acknowledge my love of God, and that God is One.”Rabbi Akiva explained that the text asks people to love God with all their soulsand that the moment of death is the opportunity to do so. As he died, RabbiAkiva had the following words on his lips: “Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, theLord is One.” Legend has it that Rabbi Akiva said the word “one” as he died.Rabbi Akiva’s manner of death and the high level of consciousness that itdescribes is well known in Kabbalistic tradition and considered to be anarchetype. Rabbi Akiva saw his own horrible death not as a tragedy but rather asa spiritual opportunity. The story reminds Kabbalists everywhere to see everymoment as a spiritual opportunity and to know that “God is One.”RABBI SHIMON BAR YOCHAI WRITES THE ZOHARRabbi Shimon Bar Yochai was a student of Rabbi Akiva who ultimately earned areputation as an extraordinarily important figure in the history of Kabbalah.Although the Roman Empire was successful in murdering Rabbi Akiva (see thepreceding section), the Romans were unsuccessful at capturing Rabbi Shimon BarYochai. He and his son sought refuge in a small cave and avoided arrest by theRomans for 13 years.Kabbalistic tradition maintains that both Moses and Elijah the Prophet appearedto Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai while he hid in the cave. During their isolation, therabbi and his son experienced visions of the greatest depth that led RabbiShimon Bar Yochai to write the great classic of Kabbalistic tradition, theZohar, the Book of Splendor.The multilevel nature of Kabbalistic ideas and the unique ways they influenceeach other make it almost impossible to translate Kabbalistic ideas into wordson a page. But the Zohar is a text that expounds upon the major themes ofKabbalah. Kabbalistic tradition holds that Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai wrote theZohar, and it was then hidden away for centuries.THRIVING IN SPAIN IN THE 13TH CENTURYAfter the decimation of the Jewish community due to the oppression of the RomanEmpire, Kabbalistic tradition was preserved from one generation to the next as afew highly skilled and trained individuals transmitted the tradition to a fewchosen students. It wasn’t until the 13th century that the teachings of Kabbalahbegan to spread far and wide.In the 13th century, 1,200 years after the destruction of the Temple inJerusalem, a Spanish Kabbalist named Moses de Leon revealed the document knownas the Zohar (it had been hidden away for centuries; see the preceding section).The Zohar became such an important part of the Kabbalistic tradition that it’soften considered one of the three pillars of the wisdom writings of the Childrenof Israel; the other two pillars are the Torah and the Talmud.Much of the scholarship of the Kabbalists in Spain centered around the followingtwo major threads of Kabbalistic tradition at that time, which are bothmentioned in the Talmud:bullet [Images/check.png] Ma’aseh Bereshit (mah-ah-seh ber-aye-sheet): Themystical understanding of the verses in the Torah in the book of Genesisdescribing the process of creation. Kabbalists believe that a careful look atthe details of the creation in the Torah results in a deeper understanding ofthe fundamentals of human existence. In the most precise yet mysterious way,each letter, word, and sentence both contains and sheds light on the mostprofound wisdom.In the same way that Kabbalistic tradition teaches followers not simply toacknowledge the surface of life but rather to pierce into the depths of things(see Chapter 14), Kabbalists don’t look (and never did look) at the Ma’asehBereshit on a superficial level. Rather, Kabbalists analyze this verse in asdetailed a way as possible, down to the minute nuances contained within theTorah text that are believed by Kabbalists to reveal extraordinary ideas andideals.bullet [Images/check.png] Ma’aseh Merkava (mah-ah-seh mer-kah-vah): The study ofthe vision in Ezekiel’s prophecy and the other details in the verses containedin the book of Ezekiel found in the Holy Scriptures including images of a divinechariot. Kabbalistic tradition teaches that the fantastic visions of Ezekielalso contain the most sublime teachings and permit students a glimpse into thedeepest depths of Torah. According the great Jewish philosopher and rabbi, Mosesben Maimon (Maimonides), who was born in Spain in 1135, Ma’aseh Merkava is alsothe general term that refers to the obligation and effort on the part of allJews to try to grasp God and to contemplate the meaning of God and God’sattributes.The Jewish community in Spain flourished for a number of centuries. For the mostpart, Jews lived peacefully with their Arab and Christian neighbors, and theJewish community was well integrated into all levels of Spanish society.However, in the same year that King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella supported thevoyage of Columbus from Spain across the Atlantic Ocean, they also threatenedthe conversion or expulsion of the Jews of Spain. Many Jews stayed andconverted, but a large number of Jews left Spain and settled in the countries tothe east of Spain and as far east as Russia. Many Eastern European Jews from thelast few centuries descend from the Jews who fled from Spain at that time.THE JEWISH PEOPLE ARE LIKE A PLANTBotanists know that cutting back a plan often results in a burst of growth andflowering; paradoxically, cutting or trimming a plant stimulates its growth. Theobservation has been made that the history of Kabbalah is, in fact, the historyof a plant that continues to be cut back.The profound teaching pertaining to the transition between the expulsion of themajority of Jewish people from Spain in 1492 and the next great period of growthin the Kabbalistic tradition observes that, throughout Jewish history, theJewish people behave as a surviving nation in the manner of a plant thatcontinues to bounce back after being trimmed and cut back.bullet [Images/check.png] When the great Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed in 70CE and the Rabbinic period was decimated at the hands of the fierce andintolerant Romans, the result was a document known as the Talmud. The Talmudrepresents an amazing fountain and flourishing of learning among the forebearsof those who would be officially known as Kabbalists.bullet [Images/check.png] When the Jews, including the great Kabbalists ofSpain, were expelled from Spain in 1492, the result was a burst of creativityand an amazing flourishing of Kabbalistic innovation — poetry, literature,philosophy — reflecting a diversity of practices and perspectives on how best toexpress and engage in Kabbalah.bullet [Images/check.png] The terrible massacres of the Jewish people startingin 1648, known as the Chmielnicki massacres, included as targets greatKabbalists in the Ukraine, which was home to a huge Jewish population. The birthof Hasidism occurred shortly after this horrible experience in Jewish history,reshaping Kabbalah to changing times and becoming one of the major forces activein passing Kabbalah on to current generations.COMING OF AGE IN THE MYSTICAL CITY OF TZFATIn the early 1500s, just a short span of years since the expulsion of the Jewsfrom Spain in 1492, a community of Kabbalists sprung up in the city of Tzfat inthe Holy Land. This gathering of great Kabbalists and scholars essentiallyformulated the way in which Kabbalah would be studied and understood then and inthe future.A GATHERING OF GREAT MINDSThe Kabbalah that serious practitioners study and practice today is the Kabbalahof the great sages of the city of Tzfat in the 16th century. Primary among thesesages was the great Kabbalist Rabbi Isaac Luria, known as the Ari, whosingle-handedly transformed the study of Kabbalah. Kabbalists from then untilnow know that their Kabbalah is the Kabbalah of the Ari (see Chapter 18).In Tzfat, a congregation of rabbis and holy teachers flourished for a brief butsignificant time. Rabbi Isaac Luria died before he reached the age of 40, and hebarely wrote anything. But much of his teachings were put into writing, in awork called Etz Chayim (ayts chah -yeem; the Tree of Life). In 1570, Rabbi ChaimVital became a student of the Ari, and when the Ari died in 1572, Rabbi Vitalbegan to write down everything he had learned from his master.In 1570, the Ari arrived in Tzfat from Egypt and found a gathering of some ofthe finest Jewish minds in history. These outstanding Kabbalists includedbullet [Images/check.png] Rabbi Joseph Karo, who was not only a great Kabbalistbut also the author of the famous Code of Jewish Law, the Shulchan Aruchbullet [Images/check.png] Shlomo Alkabetz, one the greatest poets of Spanishculture who, among other things, composed a song called “L’cha Dodi,” which issung to this day by Jews throughout the world who participate in the Fridaynight ritual known as Kabbalat Shabbat. Kabbalat Shabbat is a series of prayersdeveloped by the Kabbalists of Tzfat that became one of the cornerstones ofJewish Sabbath observance.bullet [Images/check.png] Israel Najara, a great poet in this Kabbalisticcommunitybullet [Images/check.png] Moses Cordovero, often considered the leader of allthe primary Kabbalists of his timeIMPORTANT PRINCIPLES TAUGHT AND REVEALED BY THE ARIThe hundreds or perhaps thousands of books of Kabbalah that have been writtenover the generations are mostly attempts to clarify, expand, and develop theteachings found in the Zohar. Through the writings of his disciple Rabbi ChaimVital, the Ari continued that process and expressed much of what ultimately cameto be called the heart and soul of Kabbalah for centuries and until today.SOME TEACHINGS OF THE ARIHere are some of the pivotal ideas that can be found in the Ari’s teachings:bullet [Images/check.png] God acts in the world through ten emanations of divineinfluence called the ten sefirot.bullet [Images/check.png] These ten sefirot serve as instruments of the Divine.bullet [Images/check.png] Even though God is infinite and has no limits orattributes in worldly terms, God chooses to be revealed to the world through theten sefirot.bullet [Images/check.png] The sefirot disseminate into the world in a widevariety of combinations, and these combinations determine the workings of theworld.bullet [Images/check.png] Humans act upon the combinations of sefirot throughtheir actions, thoughts, and words.bullet [Images/check.png] The evil in the world is the result of a distortion ofthe sefirot prompted by evil thoughts, words, and deeds among humans.bullet [Images/check.png] The Torah is a revelation of the proper way to live sothat the divine plenty in the form of the ten sefirot will nourish the worldproperly.bullet [Images/check.png] A deed known as a mitzvah (mitz-vah) helps to causethe proper combination among sefirot in order to prompt the proper amount ofshefa (sheh-fah; divine plenty) in the world.bullet [Images/check.png] A sin or a transgression contributes to the forces ofpollution in the world.bullet [Images/check.png] Kabbalah is that innermost part of the teachings ofthe Torah that explains the significance of every movement and thought inmetaphysical terms.bullet [Images/check.png] The person who acquires authentic Kabbalistic wisdomcan use the ability that this wisdom provides to become closer to God and toestablish a deeper relationship with God. When this connection occurs, aKabbalist is able to repair the world and become a partner with God in theprocess of perfecting the world.THE CREATION OF THE WORLDIncluded among the teachings of the Ari is one that became pivotal amongKabbalists forever: his understanding of the creation of the world. The Aritaught that the world was created by an act of divine contraction known astzimtzum (tzim -tzoom). According to this teaching, the Infinite hid orcontracted itself, resulting in a “place” in which God could create the finiteworld.Kabbalists often say that the world exists and is built on “an absence of being”and that this nonbeing comes from God. For the concept of the world’s existence,the Ari also offered the image of the shattering of the vessel. Some say thatthe best way to describe the Ari’s image of the shattering of the vessel is toimagine a vessel in which the infinite light of God poured in; needless to say,this infinite light couldn’t be contained by a finite vessel, and therefore thevessel shattered. The teachings go on to declare that the light of God iscovered over by shards of the shattered vessel, and it’s the role of theKabbalist to find these shards, sometimes called “husks,” and release the divinesparks trapped inside of them. In this way, the Kabbalist becomes a partner withGod by repairing the world.The Kabbalistic view of creation then, as taught by the Ari, is that the worldthat Kabbalists now know and live in is made up of elements that contradict eachother and are incomplete, chaotic, and confusing due to the breaking of thevessel. The fragments of the pure vessel are scattered throughout the world andthroughout existence. Some of the shattered pieces are clear, bright, reliable,and formed the foundation of the world. Others are distorted and became forcesof evil that humans need to repair.THE NEED TO REPAIR THE WORLDThe Ari taught that life in its entirety is an endless struggle to form lightout of darkness, to repair the broken world. Through self-discipline, high moralbehavior, proper intention, prayer, study, and good deeds, the Kabbalist helpsto repair the world and restore it to its proper place. Kabbalists don’t waitfor the Messiah but rather work to bring the Messiah. Each proper thought, word,and deed (as described in the holy books) bring more rapid redemption of theworld as a whole.This vision is at the heart of the teachings of the Ari. His teachingsultimately became Kabbalah; all Kabbalistic traditions before it funnel throughthe teachings of the Ari, and all Kabbalistic tradition that came after the Arigrew out of the Kabbalah of the Ari himself. The teachings of the Ari are thefoundation upon which Hasidic approaches to Kabbalah are based (see Chapter 1).THE BIGGER YOU ARE, THE HARDER YOU FALL: THE SHABBATAI TZVI AFFAIRShabbatai Tzvi is an influential figure in Jewish history (and specifically inthe history of Kabbalah) whose legacy continues today in its impact on the veryimage of Kabbalah in the world.Shabbatai Tzvi was born in 1626 and had a traditional religious education. As ayoung man, he was well versed in Talmudic studies and took a particular likingto Kabbalah. Shabbatai Tzvi settled in Salonica, Greece, wherefrom he wasexpelled for his abuse of power and holy symbols. One story reports that theexpulsion was punishment for a wedding that he staged with himself as the groomand the Torah as the bride.Shabbatai Tzvi had a remarkably charismatic personality and was a captivatingteacher, given his mastery of the Talmud, the Zohar, and other mystical texts.In 1663, Shabbatai Tzvi went to Egypt and studied with the Kabbalah scholars inresidence there.At that same time, a man named Nathan from a place called Gaza was known as agreat spiritual personality who bestowed blessings on others with remarkableoutcomes. Shabbatai Tzvi visited Nathan, and the result of the encounter wasthat Nathan of Gaza became Shabbatai Tzvi’s ardent disciple. In 1665, reportedlyat the encouragement of Nathan of Gaza, Shabbatai Tzvi declared himself to bethe messiah.Shabbatai Tzvi had a great impact on many, including some of the greatest rabbisof the time who were swept up in his pseudo-messianic fervor, and he attracted avast number of followers. His great Talmudic scholarship and skillfulmanipulation of Kabbalistic text held sway over Rabbinic leaders as well as themasses. After declaring himself to be the Messiah, Shabbatai Tzvi’s abuse ofpower escalated; he even made proclamations claiming the authority to change theTorah law.The rabbis of Jerusalem weren’t among those who were swayed by Shabbatai Tzvi’sskill set and charm, and they banned him from the holy city of Jerusalem. Therabbis of Jerusalem generated a letter-writing campaign warning leading rabbisthroughout the world of his unfounded claims. Shabbatai Tzvi and Nathan of Gazathen traveled together far and wide, and through travels and public appearances,Shabbatai Tzvi continued to gain popularity.As the tidal wave of support for Shabbatai Tzvi increased, the Turkishauthorities became curious. They also became alarmed by the growing movement offollowers of Shabbatai Tzvi and the fact that over 100,000 followers had soldtheir businesses in preparation to follow him, in his role as messiah, back toIsrael. The economic disruption was intense, and the Turkish authorities issuedan ultimatum to Shabbatai Tzvi: He should either convert to Islam or beexecuted.That unique personality Shabbatai Tzvi, whose charisma swept Europe and Asiainfluencing the masses in general and students of Kabbalah in particular,disappointed his public when he converted to Islam. He took a Muslim name, wasgiven a job, and was accepted into Islam. It’s said that sometimes ShabbataiTzvi lived the life of a Muslim and sometimes he attempted to reclaim powerwithin local Jewish communities. He died at age 50. Nathan of Gaza continued tospread belief in Shabbatai Tzvi.Shabbatai Tzvi’s popularity was so great and his reputation reached such heightsthat his fall was dramatic and damaged the reputation of Kabbalah phenomenally.Shabbatai Tzvi’s focus on Kabbalah and his ultimate downfall came to be seen asa great example of how Kabbalah in the wrong hands leads to tragedy.THE GREAT REVIVAL: HASIDISMAs I mention in the sidebar “The Jewish people are like a plant,” terriblemassacres known as the Chmielnicki massacres occurred in the Ukraine in the1600s. The destruction of Jewish families, including many of the greatKabbalists of that generation, during these events was vast. In the midst of thedespair, and during the trauma experienced by the survivors in the decades afterthis terrible cataclysm, a teacher emerged who caused nothing short of arevolution in Jewish life that would change Judaism forever.This teacher founded a movement that would rediscover the wisdom of Kabbalah andwould dedicate itself to spreading this wisdom to everyone.THE RISE OF THE BAAL SHEM TOVIn 1698, a boy named Israel was born in Okop, a tiny village in the Ukraine onthe border between Russia and Poland. Israel’s parents, Eliezer and Sarah, weredeeply spiritual people. They were quite old at the time of Israel’s birth anddied when he was still a boy. Legend tells that Eliezer’s last words to his sonIsrael were “Fear nothing other than God.”As an orphan, Israel was cared for by the community. He earned a reputation forwalking through woods and fields, staying by himself, and praying to God — notin formal prayer, but in spontaneous prayer that poured out from his heart. Ashe grew up, he became a local teacher as well as a caretaker in a synagogue,which provided him with the time he needed to attain an extraordinary level ofknowledge, particularly of the mysteries and secrets of Kabbalah.In 1734, Rabbi Israel changed his approach to life radically. Rather than keepto himself, he became a great teacher, and his reputation spread far and wide asan amazing holy man who understood the secret names of God and could use themproperly in blessings and to entreat God on behalf of supplicants who asked forintercession. He became known as the Baal Shem Tov (bah-ahl shem towv; Master ofthe Good Name), and to this day, more people know him as the Baal Shem Tov thanas Rabbi Israel. The Baal Shem Tov’s teachings were based on the Kabbalisticteachings, and in particular, the teachings of the Ari (see the section“Important principles taught and revealed by the Ari” earlier in this chapter).Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]What the Baal Shem Tov offered that was different from the teachings of the Ariwas an ability and desire to spread Kabbalistic teachings to all levels of thecommunity. The Baal Shem Tov was able to communicate the most profound ideasthrough stories and parables, sayings, and teachings that shed light on thegreatest and most fundamental of Kabbalistic principles in a way that almostanyone could understand.Over the years, the Baal Shem Tov became more and more famous, and greatscholars became his scholars and disciples. The Baal Shem Tov also representedthe principle of reaching out to others to spread blessing and knowledge to all.From the mid-1700s to the present, Kabbalah manifested itself in a living waythrough the lives of the followers of the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of themovement of Hasidism.The Baal Shem Tov didn’t record his teachings in books, so most of whatKabbalists know about his teachings come from a book called Toldos Yaakov Yosef,written by Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Hakohen of Polnoye. Rabbi Yaakov Yosef wrote thisand some other volumes that contain hundreds of quotes from the Baal Shem Tov —some short and some long, but all coming together to form the basis of theKabbalistic lifestyle known as Hasidism.A CONTEMPORARY OPPONENTIn the years that overlapped the life of the Baal Shem Tov, another greatstudent and leader of Kabbalah appeared. His name was Rabbi Eliyahu of Vilna,and he was known as the Vilna Gaon. Living in the 18th century, the Vilna Gaonbecame known as an opponent of Hasidism and the followers of the Baal Shem Tov,but like the Baal Shem Tov, the Vilna Gaon was also a great student of Kabbalah.One of their differences is that the Vilna Gaon saw Kabbalah as a subject forthe few, whereas the Baal Shem Tov wanted to spread knowledge of Kabbalah to themasses.THE SLANDERING OF KABBALAH AMONG HISTORIANSFor years, Kabbalah has gotten a bad rap among historians — even Jewishhistorians. In their histories of the Jewish people, a few key Jewish historiansrelegated Kabbalah to a narrow or fringe aspect of the tradition from Moses atMount Sinai and viewed it as having been drowned out.These historians, swept up by the Enlightenment and the modern scientific age,were squeamish about the spiritual ideas contained in Kabbalah. Largely becausethey couldn’t understand the concepts themselves and didn’t grasp the deepsignificance of Kabbalistic teachings as the very soul of Torah, theseinfluential historians missed the point. As a result, a tremendous amount ofignorance and misinformation about Kabbalah has been disseminated by otherwiseseemingly reliable sources.The good news is that scholars are now widely recognizing and writing about thecentral role of Kabbalah as the very soul of Judaism.A MOVEMENT IS BORNWhen the Baal Shem Tov died, leadership of his movement of spreading Kabbalah tothe masses was handed over to Rabbi Dov Ber, known as the Maggid of Mezrich. TheMaggid of Mezrich was the Baal Shem Tov’s primary disciple, but he’d also been astudent of the teachings of the Ari as well as of another great Kabbalist inhistory, Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto.The disciples of the Maggid of Mezrich and their disciples through history tothe present comprise the Hasidic movement, that group of people in the worldwhose lives are primarily based on the same beliefs and the same rhythms asKabbalists throughout the centuries. Up until the time of the Baal Shem Tov,only a very small number of people were concerned with Kabbalah. For the lastfew centuries, the Hasidic world has continued to spread the message ofKabbalah. Hasidic groups today such as Lubavitch, Bobov, Satmar, and Breslov allbase their beliefs and lives on Kabbalistic practices and assumptions that theytrace back to the Baal Shem Tov.KABBALAH TODAYActive interest in Kabbalah exists today in four main veins, which I explore inthis section. In all cases, today’s Kabbalists are influenced by the Kabbalah ofthe Ari (see the section “Coming of Age in the Mystical City of Tzfat” earlierin this chapter).In addition, Kabbalah teachers aren’t always a part of any defined group but mayhave a depth of knowledge, an understanding heart, a reluctance to teach, andthe willingness to guide regardless. Such teachers join the many individuals,well-known and anonymous, who have continued to probe the depths of the profoundquestions of life through the way of Kabbalah.KABBALAH AND HASIDISMKabbalah is alive and well in the Hasidic precincts of the Jewish community.Although severely damaged by the Holocaust, demographics indicate that theworldwide Hasidic population is flourishing and will continue to flourish.Additionally, this segment of the Jewish population is clearly growing at agreater rate than any other.The Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism, brought Kabbalah to the masses. Throughstraight talk as well as instructive parables and the gifts of a master teacher,the Baal Shem Tov and his disciples through the generations were able totranslate the wisdom of Kabbalah from a difficult and abstract science ofexistence into a way of life that all can live.KABBALAH AND JEWISH RENEWALFounded by Rabbi Zalman Schachter Shalomi and also greatly influenced by theteachings and spirit of the late Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, the phenomenon known asJewish Renewal is a nontraditional, loosely networked group who have a greataffinity for Kabbalistic ideas and approaches to life.The use of the word “renewal” in this movement’s title is meant to imply that,after the Holocaust, when the old forms of spiritual expression in the Jewishcommunity (Kabbalah) were once again silenced, it became necessary not simply toreproduce the old but to renew it. By looking at old paradigms and old forms ofspiritual and Kabbalistic expression, Jewish Renewal develops new, modern waysto give expression to those ideas and ideals without necessarily being committedto the choreography of traditional Jewish life as it has been manifested intraditional communities.CONSERVATIVE, REFORM, AND RECONSTRUCTIONIST JUDAISMWith the popularization of Kabbalah in our times, every denomination and manyJewish community centers have brought teachers versed in Kabbalah into theirseminaries and programs. Prayer book and bible commentaries across alldenominations now highlight the influence of the Kabbalists on the developmentof Jewish prayer and thinking.KABBALAH AND THE KABBALAH CENTREThe Kabbalah Centre, led by Rabbi Philip Berg, has a widespread public profiledue largely to Madonna and other celebrities who have publicly announced theirinterest in Kabbalah Centre programs. The Centre has offices around the worldthat often attract media attention when famous people are seen coming or going.According to its Web site (www.kabbalah.com [http://www.kabbalah.com] ), “TheKabbalah Centre is a spiritual and educational organization dedicated tobringing the wisdom of Kabbalah to the world.”The Kabbalah Centre has produced many books written mostly by its founder andhis family members. It markets its books, products, and activities as “thepractical tools and spiritual teachings of Kabbalah” and states that Kabbalah is“accessible to everyone for personal change and transformation.” The Centre’sapproach has been widely criticized in the Jewish world, with critics claimingthat the Kabbalah Centre separates Kabbalah from Judaism and from Jewish lawsand obligations."},{"pageContent":"PART IICUTTING TO THE CORE OF KABBALAH[Images/915904 fgCN02.jpg]In this part . . .In order to go a little deeper into Kabbalah, you have to let go of some beliefsand open yourself up to some new ideas (actually, they’re quite old!). This partfirst looks at the seemingly audacious idea that everything happens for thebest. Then it explores the Kabbalistic perspective on the human soul (it hasfive parts, by the way) before getting to the heart of a Kabbalist’s task in theworld — to repair it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4THE LINK BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH: KABBALAH’S OWN TOP-TEN COUNTDOWNIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Getting to know the ten forces of the universe and thehuman soulbullet [Images/arrow.png] Analyzing the Tree of Life from different anglesbullet [Images/arrow.png] Understanding how Kabbalists experience the forces ofthe worldKabbalists believe that a superficial look at the world is simply that — anarrow and limited grasp of reality. They believe that a lot more is going onbeneath the surface of what people see.In this chapter, you discover the Kabbalistic belief in ten fundamental forcesthat drive everything, and you find out that humans can manipulate those forces.In fact, the heart of the life of the Kabbalist is the manipulation of these tenfundamental forces that God uses to create and sustain the world.SEEING BELOW THE WORLD’S SURFACESome people believe that a person is born, lives, and dies. In other words somepeople think that you begin at the moment of conception and cease to exist whenyour body merges into the earth. But according to the great Kabbaliststhroughout history, there’s more to life than often meets the eye.The Kabbalist’s task is to pierce the seemingly hard surface of the reality ofthe world and glimpse the reality of God. Through deeds and prayer, study, andintense contemplation on the abstract, unknowable God, the Kabbalist has faiththat a more clear and real apprehension of reality is possible.Kabbalah provides the student with the tools he or she needs to break throughthe surface of the hard and concrete reality. In the same way that a molecularbiologist has tools allowing him to see electrons, protons, and neutrons and thespaces between objects, so too the Kabbalist has tools in the form of knowledgeof the ten sefirot (seh- fear -oat), the four worlds (see Chapter 6), and theteachings of the Torah that allow for a vision of the reality within all theperceived reality.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalists know that the human mind and perceptions are often distracted by thematerial world to such an extent that God isn’t seen and, more extreme, God’sexistence is denied. The goal of the Kabbalist is to see God as the center ofall reality. Kabbalah teaches the student how to know God and reminds thestudent that often what one sees is an illusion.It’s tempting to say that Kabbalists don’t trust surfaces, but that isn’tentirely true. More accurately, a Kabbalist sees the surface of things andrecognizes it for what it is — a surface. Think of the human body. You look atthe human body and see all its external features. If you were to simply stopthere, you’d get an accurate view of the external form of the body. Yet beneaththat external form are major and minor organs, veins and arteries, differentkinds of cells, and all kinds of bodily functions happening simultaneously.A Kabbalist makes the same assumption about the world: The surface that one seescertainly exists and provides lots of information about the world itself, butbeneath that surface are all kinds of activities vital to a more completeunderstanding of God’s universe.THE WORLD IS FILLED WITH GODA few ideas and assumptions made by Kabbalists come together and offer a verydifferent view of reality. First and foremost, the tradition of Kabbalah teachesthat everything in the world is filled with God. This is a basic assumption ofKabbalah, but of course, it can’t be proven. In fact, Kabbalists don’t eventhink of proving it. For a Kabbalist, the world is filled with God, and this isas plain and as evident as anything else. A Kabbalist experiences the world asfilled with God.Everything that happens in the world, even the most seemingly trivial details,all occur because God allows it. Everything is from God. Pleasure, pain, beauty,harmony, evil — everything. God knows what is best, so if something doesn’t workout the way you want it to, the assumption is that this is ultimately the wayGod wants it. In a sense, Kabbalah is based on a paradox: As fundamental abelief as the fact that everything that happens is ultimately from God is thebelief that humans have free will and choose freely.GOD IS CONSTANTLY CREATING AND SUSTAINING THE WORLDAnother primary assumption in the tradition of Kabbalah is that God constantlycreates the world for the purpose of bestowing good to the world. You might say,“How do we know that?” The Kabbalistic answer is that this isn’t a matter ofbelief; it’s the reality that’s perceived by the Kabbalist. Kabbalists believethat by diligent study, prayer, and proper action, you can see reality moreclearly and know that God is indeed in everything and that God does give divinegoodness to the world.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]How does God constantly sustain the world and bestow goodness to it? Kabbalistspoint to what they actually perceive in the reality of the world: tenfundamental forces, the ten sefirot. These ten forces flow in two directions:God creates and sustains the world through these ten forces, and humans takethese ten forces, combine them, mix them, utilize them, and try to learn how touse them properly. One way we communicate with God is in the ways we use orabuse the ten sefirot.Kabbalists believe that the world humans exist in isn’t the harmonious worldthat it could be. When Kabbalists refer to Gan Eden (gahn ayden; the Garden ofEden), they conjure up a view of a world of harmony. It is, in fact, the task ofeach person to do what he or she can to repair the disharmony and put things intheir right order. Kabbalists teach that the proper human use of the fundamentalforces in the world is the task of humans. Kabbalists learn to recognize the tenforces and see reality in terms of their functioning.A NEW CREATION EVERY MOMENTAt least one traditional observer puts it this way: God continues to create theworld, and if God were to hesitate for a moment and glance in another direction,the entire universe and everything in it would disappear. Kabbalists believe theworld is being created anew at every moment, and thinking that time flowsuninterrupted is an illusion. Every moment is an entirely brand-new moment forthe universe; although the world looks the same at this moment as it did amoment before, that’s simply an illusion.One of the fundamental implications of this notion of God’s continued creationis that God is involved with everything that goes on in the universe. As theBaal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, stated, “Even the movement of a singleblade of grass occurs because God wills it to occur.”According to Kabbalah, God doesn’t form the universe out of nothing. Rather,creation is really an act of revelation. As one Kabbalist put it, creation is anemanation from the divine light. Kabbalists believe that God shines this divinelight and forms it, limits it, and transmutes it into the world. As Kabbalistsfrequently note, the world couldn’t possibly exist within the actual light ofthe Divine, so one of the mysteries of creation is that God hides or contracts,limiting God’s infiniteness and withholding light, in order to continuouslycreate the world.THE TEN FUNDAMENTAL FORCES THAT SUSTAIN THE WORLDA primary notion within Kabbalah is the belief that the world is created andsustained by ten channels of divine plenty. These ten channels are referred toas the ten sefirot.The ten sefirot are not simple. Kabbalists point out that each of the tensefirot has many different meanings and gradations, and they appear in variousKabbalistic texts using varying and alternate terminology. In one of the basicKabbalistic texts, Sefer Yetzirah (see Chapter 13), the sefirot are described asnumbers. But generally speaking, the sefirot are referred to as emanations, orqualities of God. In the 12th century Kabbalistic text Sefer Ha Bahir, the tensefirot are related to the ten words or sayings by which the world was created.In the major Kabbalistic text, the Zohar, other words such as “powers,” “gates,”“lights,” and even “garments” refer to the ten sefirot.Kabbalists throughout the centuries have developed a system that views the tensefirot as the fundamental building blocks of the world and of the human soul.God creates the universe continuously by emanating the ten sefirot and combiningthem. An important view of Kabbalists is that humans are a microcosm of theworld, and just as the world is created and sustained through the ten sefirot,the soul of each individual consists of the ten sefirot.THE BIBLE SAYS “TEN UTTERANCES,” NOT “TEN COMMANDMENTS”In the Kabbalistic tradition, there’s no such phrase as “The Ten Commandments.”The term in Hebrew is Aseret Hadibrot (ah-ser-et hah-dib-rote), which translatesto the Ten Utterances. (Not quite as catchy as “commandments”. . . .) Kabbalistshave linked these ten utterances to the ten sefirot and conclude that the worldwas created and continues to be created through ten divine expressions.The Zohar contains a remarkable statement that God looked into the Torah beforehe created the world. The implication of this image is that the Torah holds theblueprint of reality. More specifically, the chart of the ten sefirot isconsidered the blueprint of the world and the blueprint of the human soul.The chart of the ten sefirot has appeared in many documents throughout thecenturies. Frequently, the ten sefirot are drawn as an arrangement or aconfiguration resembling a human being, with each of the ten sefirotcorresponding to one of the organs or limbs of the body. This illustration issometimes known as the Tree of Life (see Figure 4-1). In this section, Idescribe each of the ten sefirot individually using the Tree of Lifeconfiguration.Figure 4-1: The ten sefirot as the Tree of Life.Figure 4-1: The ten sefirot as the Tree of Life. [Images/915904 fg0401.jpg]Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]If you’re paying attention, you see that eleven sefirot actually appear on theTree of Life. The reason is that two of the sefirot, Keter (crown) and Da’at(knowledge) are interchangeable, as I explain later in this section.THE CROWNThe uppermost sefirah on the chart of the Tree of Life is Keter (keh- tehr;crown). Unlike the other sefirot, which have parts of the human body asreference points, Keter doesn’t refer to a human body part but rather refers toa royal crown sitting on top of a head. This depiction offers a hint at themeaning behind Keter.Keter is often referred to as the divine will and the source of all delight andpleasure. Keter contains all the other sefirot in it, and it’s often said thatKeter activates the soul from above. Kabbalists suggest that one should pictureGod sending divine light and power down through the top of the head, infusingthe entire body with all of its abilities and qualities.Keter is considered to be the link between the infinite world of God and thefinite world in which people live. Keter starts the flow of each of the sefirotinto the next, and the sefirah on the bottom returns to Keter at the top andcompletes the circle.In response to the commonly asked question “Why did God create the world?,”Kabbalists agree that God didn’t create the world because God needs it. To saythat God needs anything implies a deficiency, and one can never say that God isdeficient in any way. Many Kabbalists indicate that God created the world inorder to create the human being and that God created the human being in order togive the human being pleasure. It follows, then, that the greatest pleasure thata human can experience is knowledge of God. Nevertheless, in the final analysis,Kabbalists agree that God creates the world through Keter , the divine will. Inother words, God “wills” the world, and it is through God’s will that the worldis created.Each of the ten sefirot has a name of God corresponding to it. The name of Godthat corresponds to Keter is Ehveh (eh- veh), which is a form of “I shall be.”WISDOM: THE INTUITIVE MINDThe second sefirah, Chochmah (khokh- mah), translates as wisdom and is oftenreferred to as intuition. Chochmah is the basis of the human’s ability to graspthings intuitively. By coming from Keter, Chochmah is considered to be a higherwisdom — the wisdom that’s somehow inborn.In my experience raising birds, I’ve seen intuition firsthand. Many birds havelaid eggs in cages in my living room, and I’ve had the privilege of watchingbaby birds emerge from those eggs many times. I often marvel that the birds seemto know what to do without being taught; they know how to eat, bathe, preenthemselves, and do many other things without benefit of a school, class, orbook. The higher wisdom within them knows how to be and how to manifest as abird.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Chochmah represents the beginning of thought and the beginning of mentalactivity. It takes the pure energy of Keter and transforms it into somethinguseful, creating the intellect.Note that Chochmah, a top sefirah on the right side of the Tree of Life, issometimes referred to as conception. Kabbalists often refer to right side andleft side when looking at the configuration of sefirot in this diagram. Theright vertical line is considered masculine and sometimes is referred to asfather or abba. The left side is considered feminine and is referred to as themother or ema.The name of God often associated with Chochmah is Yah. Kabbalists have alsoassociated biblical figures with several of the sefirot, and the biblical figurecorresponding to Chochmah is King Solomon. This connection isn’t surprising, ofcourse, because wisdom is associated with the archetype of King Solomon, thewisest man who ever lived.UNDERSTANDING: THE ANALYTICAL MINDThe sefirah of Binah (bee- nah) means understanding. Binah manifests the abilityof logical analysis. For example, simple algebra indicates that if A = B and B =C, then A = C. One’s Binah allows for easy understanding of this simple set ofequations.In a way, Binah is seen as Chochmah ’s partner (see the preceding section for anexplanation of Chochmah ). These two sefirot, often referred to as father andmother, male and female, and “two beloved friends” and the interaction betweenthem are often described in erotic language. Binah, as the sefirah that takesinformation and figures it out internally, is sometimes referred to as thedivine womb. Some Kabbalists go so far as to say that Binah gives birth to allthe sefirot that come after it.Another way that Chochmah and Binah are a pair is that Binah probes the meaningof that which comes from Chochmah. Kabbalists often refer to Binah as theability to make distinctions between and among things. They relate the word“Binah” to the Hebrew word livnot (liv-note; to build). Binah takes the abstractwisdom from Chochmah and builds on it, expanding and developing it.The name of God connected to the sefirah of Binah is Elohim (eh-low-heem), andthe biblical figure that’s often connected with Binah is the matriarch Leah.SCIENTIFIC SEFIROTModern theorists observe that Binah and Chochmah correspond neatly withleft-brain and right-brain thinking. Of course, the notions of Chochmah andBinah predate such theories by many centuries, but it’s not unusual forKabbalistic insights made generations ago to foreshadow scientific discoveries.Another observation is that the Tree of Life looks very much like the doublehelix of DNA. In addition, the combination of masculine and feminine result inthe creation of the sefirot that follow them.DA’AT: THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF AWARENESSThe sefirah of Da’at (dah- aht) is referred to as knowledge.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Da’at is interchangeable with Keter, the crown. When referring to exactly tensefirot, one either counts the ten including Keter and leaving out Da’at or theother way around. Why? Simply put, Keter is an emanation from God, whereas Da’atis the experience of man. Da’at is specifically experienced knowledge, and Da’atis a view of reality from the point of view of the human being and his or heraccumulated experiences. In its ultimate form, Da’at is knowledge of God.Da’at is different from Chochmah and Binah. Whereas Chochmah is intuition andBinah is understanding or the ability to grasp concepts, knowledge is anaccumulation of experience. In other words, there are three ways in which aperson knows the functions of the mind or of consciousness: through theintuitive grasp of Chochmah, through the analytical powers of Binah, and throughthe accumulation of one’s experiences, known as one’s Da’at.Imagine putting your finger into a hot flame. In some ways, you hesitate to putyour finger into a flame because your intuition tells you that the dancing blue,yellow, and red flame offers some danger. In another way, your Binah prompts youto avoid putting your finger in the flame because you figure that if the flameis sufficiently hot, then putting your flesh into the heat will not serve itwell. Your powers of figuring things out are at your service. Additionally, yourexperience of flames in the past — your Da’at — tells you not to put your fingerinto the heat.EXPANSION: THE IMPULSE TO GIVEThe sefirah of Chesed (keh -sed), which translates as grace, is the fourthsefirah. It’s characterized by an expanding impulse and is sometimes referred toas Gedulah (geh-doo -lah), which means greatness. (Sometimes, the entire rightvertical line of the Tree of Life is referred to as the side of Chesed, whichmakes sense because the right side is known as the masculine side, and Chesed ’snature as an outgoing force corresponds to that male reference.)Kabbalists also refer to Chesed as love, the inclination towards things, theattraction to things, the outgoing flow, an opening up, and a giving of itself.On the configuration of the ten sefirot as a human figure in the Tree of Life(see Figure 4-1), Chesed is associated with the right arm. The right arm reachesout and gives, and Chesed represents a love that’s given freely.Chesed also refers to kindness and benevolence, but it’s a lovingkindness thatknows no restraint. The third verse of Psalm 89 says that the world was builtwith Chesed. Whereas the preceding three sefirot of Chochmah, Binah, and Da’atare intellectual sefirot, Chesed is the first of the emotional sefirot.The name of God that’s connected to the sefirah of Chesed is El (ehl), and thebiblical figure associated with this sefirah is Abraham the patriarch. Abrahamis the legendary figure of love and expansion, which explains his connectionwith Chesed. Abraham was known to live in a tent that was open on all four sidesso that he could easily see visitors and invite them into his tent as guests.This outward thrust of welcoming visitors and guests so easily associates Chesedwith both Abraham and the masculine.Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]A helpful way to understand a sefirah is by examining its relationship withanother sefirah. In this case, a Kabbalist can increase her understanding ofChesed by deepening her understanding of its partner, Gevurah, which I talkabout in the next section.CONTRACTION: THE IMPULSE TO RECEIVEGevurah (geh-voo -rah), often known as power, is also sometimes referred to withthe Hebrew word din, meaning judgment, justice, or law. Gevurah also can meanrestraint, concentration, fear, control, or awe.Kabbalists teach that every sefirah has both a positive and negative aspect, andthis duality is perhaps most clear in the sefirah of Gevurah. The discipline andrestraint side of Gevurah can manifest itself in a positive or negative way.Gevurah is contraction, and too much contraction or too much judgment can resultin squashing or in something disruptive. On the other hand, the strength aspectof this sefirah is an inward withdrawal, a concentration of power; thatconcentration of power can result in hate or fear but also in justice andcontrol.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The sefirot of Chesed and Gevurah represent two opposing poles: Chesed reflectslove that’s free and lacking in restraint, whereas Gevurah represents disciplineand a limitation. Yet Chesed and Gevurah balance each other because Chesed is onthe right (masculine) side of the Tree of Life, and Gevurah resides on the left(feminine) side.Love is often considered feminine (like maternal love), and toughness isconsidered masculine. But in the Kabbalistic cosmology, the opposite is thecase. Chesed is expansive and therefore male, and Gevurah encloses andconstricts and is therefore feminine. Kabbalists note that Gevurah is strength,and yet the path to Gevurah is the path from Chesed. In other words, truestrength comes through giving. Gevurah harnesses the energy of Chesed.One can easily see Chesed and Gevurah at work in the world. Child rearing, forinstance, is an artful combination of expressions of Chesed and Gevurah. If aparent is too permissive, the result can be disastrous for a developing child.Similarly, if a parent is too repressive and restrictive, the result is againsad and unhealthy. But in combination, Chesed and Gevurah serve a parent well.At almost every moment of a parent’s relationship with his or her child, he orshe faces the question of just how much Chesed and just how much Gevurah tooffer. A combination of the two results in a healthy child.The name of God associated with Gevurah is Elohim (eh-low-heem ), and thebiblical figure associated with Gevurah is the patriarch Isaac. Isaac is a farmore passive personality in the Torah than Abraham, who’s associated with Chesed(see the preceding section). Although Gevurah is sometimes seen as negative, itisn’t negative to the Kabbalist, and instead is often referred to as an aspectof God’s kindness. The divine light pours down from God, and it would beimpossible to exist if that light weren’t restricted, controlled, and harnessed.The Gevurah aspect restricts the divine light and allows for the world to exist.Both Chesed and Gevurah express different aspects of God’s love and of love inthe world.HARMONY: THE DESIRE FOR BALANCEThe sefirah of Tiferet (tee-fehr -et; beauty) is a combination of harmony,truth, and compassion. Tiferet is also a balancing of the two sefirot thatprecede it, Chesed and Gevurah. The word “Tiferet” comes from the Hebrew wordpa’ear (pah-air ; beauty). Tiferet is the ability to merge the flow of Chesed,which is open and outpouring, with the restrictive nature of Gevurah and achievean appropriate mixture of the two. Tiferet is sometimes referred to as Rachamim(rah- khah-meem; compassion or mercy).On the chart of the Tree of Life shown in Figure 4-1, notice that Tiferet is atthe center. It’s the central sefirah between right and left and between top andbottom. The part of the body that corresponds to Tiferet is the upper torso.Perhaps most important to Kabbalists is the fact that Tiferet is also a symbolof the Torah. As a way of life, the Torah teaches the Kabbalist how to achievethe right balance in life. Tiferet manifests the ability to create the properbalance between Chesed and Gevurah. Often the expression of Chesed, which islovingkindness, may be a grievous error if a situation doesn’t call for suchkindness. Similarly, the severity of Gevurah is sometimes too fierce for aparticular moment or occasion.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalists believe that the perfect harmony to be achieved through a synthesisof Chesed and Gevurah isn’t absolutely equal but rather a bit more of Chesedthan Gevurah. The extra dose of lovingkindness results in the ideal kind ofharmony as found on the Tree of Life.The name of God that’s connected with the sefirah of Tiferet is the most sacredof all God’s names in Kabbalistic tradition, the Tetragrammaton (also known asthe four-letter name of God), Y-H-V-H. This connection isn’t surprising giventhat Tiferet is a symbol of the Torah.The Biblical figure associated with Tiferet is Yaakov (Jacob), who’s known inthe Torah as Israel. The three patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob correspondto the three central sefirot on the Tree of Life: Chesed, Gevurah, and Tiferet.Just as the first triad on the Tree of Life, Chochmah, Binah, and Da’at areoften referred to in Kabbalistic literature as a unit, so too is the secondtriad on the Tree of Life, Chesed, Gevurah, and Tiferet (lovingkindness,judgment, and harmony) a unit. Whereas Kabbalists consider the first threesefirot of Chochmah, Binah, and Da’at mental processes or processes ofconsciousness, the lower sefirot, Chesed, Gevurah, and Tiferet, are the sefirotthat act directly upon the world. In some ways, each person is constantlynavigating life through these sefirot.VICTORY: THE URGE TO GET THINGS DONEThe sefirah of Netzach (neh- tzakh) may be referred to as victory or eternity.Netzach is the sefirah of conquest; it’s also the capacity for overcoming. MyKabbalah teacher likes to say that Netzach is the profound urge to get thingsdone.Kabbalistic literature frequently points out that all the sefirot are pure intheir essence but that each has a positive aspect and a negative aspect. In thecase of Netzach, it’s the urge to get things done, but its negativemanifestation may be workaholism, when the urge to get things done is out ofcontrol. Another example of Netzach is when something is put into themarketplace before it’s ready, a sort of overenthusiasm.The name of God that’s connected to the sefirah of Netzach is Y-H-V-H Tzvaot(tzih-vah-oat ; the Lord of Hosts). The biblical figure associated with Netzachis Moses. As an accomplished leader, it stands to reason that Moses isassociated with the sefirah of victory and the urge to conquer.GLORY: THE WAY OF PERSISTENCEThe sefirah of Hod (hode), often referred to as splendor, is sometimes describedas persistence or holding on. Hod is also the power to repudiate obstacles (areference to persistence).Just as the three sefirot before Netzach (Chesed, Gevurah, and Tiferet ) aresefirot that act directly on the world, the next three (Netzach, Hod, and Yesod) are even more directly connected to the real world in which people live.Think of Netzach and Hod as a progression from the urge to get things done topersistence or holding on. When you want to participate in a task, you beginwith Netzach. When you’re in the midst of doing something and want to continueto do the task at hand and not poop out, you need to exercise your persistence,your ability to hold on. Suppose you want to climb a mountain, for example. Theurge to climb that mountain is Netzach. During the climb, your desire to musterup enough discipline to continue the trek is Hod. You can’t be successful withjust one and not the other.One contemporary teacher sees Hod as incubation and the place where you designthe wrapping for the idea or let it percolate to a deeper level; it’s the placeof enhancement, deeper inspiration, of completing something with fullconsciousness for it to be the best that it can be before it gets out there.Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]When you look at the chart of the Tree of Life (see Figure 4-1), you may noticethat Netzach is below Chesed, and Hod is below Gevurah. Keep in mind that theright side, which is sometimes generally referred to as Chesed, is masculine andoutgoing, so that just as Chesed is an outward gesture of lovingkindness,Netzach is an outward gesture of getting something done. Similarly on the leftside, just as Gevurah is the ability to discipline oneself, Hod is a bearingdown, an inner thrust to persist and persevere.The name of God associated with Hod, Elohim Tzvaot (eh-low-heem tzih-vah-oat;the God of Hosts), also indicates the close similarity between Netzach and Hod,which is connected to the name of God Y-H-W-H Tzvaot. Hod is usually associatedwith the biblical personality of Aaron, who was Moses’s brother and the firstHigh Priest of the Jewish people.MARK YOUR CALENDAR!Each of the seven lower sefirot, beginning with Chesed, corresponds to a day ofthe week. The day of the week associated with Yesod is Friday. Friday night isthe inauguration of the Sabbath, when the Kabbalist actually takes part in akind of wedding ceremony, marrying the divine presence in the world. A Kabbalisteven calls the Sabbath a bride. According to the Kabbalistic sages, Friday nightis also the best time for a husband and wife to make love.YESOD: THE BRIDGE-BUILDERThe sefirah of Yesod (yeh-sowd; foundation) is thought to be the vehicle orcarrier from one thing, person, or condition to another.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my Kabbalah teachers tells me that Yesod is the power of connection aswell as the capacity and the desire to build bridges or make contacts. Yesod isalso the ability to establish relationships, whether they be with teachers,parents, or lovers.The organ of the body associated with Yesod is the penis or phallus, which isappropriate when one considers that the essence of Yesod is the ability to makeconnections. Keep in mind that these associations are symbolic, so theconnection that one makes with one’s teacher, friend, or parent must never be asexual one but is nonetheless a reaching out in a desire to connect.In the same way that Tiferet is a balance of Chesed and Gevurah, so too is Yesoda balance between Netzach and Hod. Yesod stimulates the desire to connect,receive, and give. On the Tree of Life chart (see Figure 4-1), Yesod alsoappears between the central sefirah of Tiferet and the last sefirah of Malchut(see the next section). Yesod is the channel through which the central sefirahof Tiferet can unite with the ultimate, concluding sefirah of Malchut.One of the names of God connected with the sefirah of Yesod is El Shaddai (elshah-die; the Almighty God, or God Almighty). The biblical character associatedwith Yesod is Yosef (Joseph), Jacob’s son. Just as the sefirah of Jacob comesafter Abraham and Isaac on the Tree of Life, Yesod comes right below Tiferet ,or Jacob, resulting in Jacob’s favorite son, Yosef. Yesod is sometimes referredto as the foundation of the world, known in Hebrew as Yesod olam, and is seen asthe balance of the productive energies of Netzach and Hod.SOVEREIGNTY: THE ULTIMATE RECEPTACLEThe last of the ten sefirot on the Tree of Life is Malchut (mahl-khoot ;kingdom). The word “Malchut” in Hebrew is melech (meh -lekh; king).FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my Kabbalah teachers explains that Malchut is the realization of allhuman potential. It’s a summation of all the sefirot that appear above it, andthe word “kingdom” certainly refers to the ultimate and final gathering of allresources. As the bottom sefirah on the chart, Malchut receives everything fromthe sefirot above it, which is why it’s referred to as the ultimate receptacle.Malchut can be seen as the fruits of all one’s labor. Whereas Yesod is thesefirah that corresponds to the penis or phallus (see the preceding section),Malchut corresponds to the feminine form of the divine. The connection betweenthe Yesod and Malchut is a kind of cosmic sexual union that ultimately givesbirth to all the activity in the world.The day of the week that’s connected to Malchut is the Sabbath. The Sabbath isthe summation and accumulation of all the work of the week, and Malchut is therecipient of all of the sefirot above it on the Tree of Life (see Figure 4-1).Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]Malchut completes the chain of all the sefirot. The first three sefirot are anidea manifesting in the mind; the second three sefirot are those of the heart orthe emotions, which is the place where the idea that arises in the mind beginsto be evaluated. In the third triad, the idea is not only evaluated emotionallybut also acted upon and brought into being in the world. Finally, Malchut is thereal manifestation of the idea in the concrete world of reality.The name of God connected to Malchut is Shechina (sheh-khee -nah; divinepresence), which represents God’s presence in the human world. The Shechinagathers the energies of all the other sefirot and offers them to the world; itcreates a bridge between God and the world. The biblical character associatedwith Malchut is David, the great king of Israel.WAYS TO LOOK AT THE TREE OF LIFEThe configuration of the sefirot on the Tree of Life isn’t as straightforward asit appears at first glance. A lot of information is packed into the Tree ofLife. For example, there are three vertical lines in the Tree, each containingthree sefirot, with each line having its own significance. There are also threetriads, or groups of three sefirot, each also with its own significance.Lots of things are going on in this depiction, and Kabbalists interpret it froma number of different angles. In this section, I show you some of the waysKabbalists look at and analyze the chart.PLACEMENTThe placement of each sefirah on the Tree of Life gives insight into its nature.For example, Keter is on the top of the chart, and Malchut is on the bottom.This placement makes sense because Keter is known as the sefirah of connection,the primary connection between God and the world, symbolically coming fromabove, and Malchut is the primary connection between humans and the world and isseen as the final sefirah, a summation of all the others. One can picture Keterpouring down from above through the crown of each person. Malchut, on the otherhand, is on the bottom because it’s the goal of creation, the physical universeand all that’s contained within it.VERTICAL LINESThe chart of the ten sefirot consist of three lines:bullet [Images/check.png] Middle linebullet [Images/check.png] Right line, sometimes referred to as fatherbullet [Images/check.png] Left line, sometimes referred to as motherThe location of the sefirot on these lines isn’t haphazard. Kabbalists studyingthe relationships between the sefirot in each line can understand, for example,why Tiferet is on the middle line. Tiferet is, after all, harmony and balance.They can also see why Chesed and Gevurah are respectively on the left and rightsides of the Tree of Life; these two sefirot constitute a pair at two extremes,just as the Tree of Life reflects.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]As a Kabbalist familiarizes himself with the ten sefirot, he increases hisinsight into each of the sefirot and their natures by understanding why theybelong on the vertical lines on which they’re placed.HORIZONTAL LINESThe horizontal lines of the Tree of Life reveal three pairs of sefirot. Byexamining each pair, each of which forms a horizontal line of the Tree of Life,the Kabbalist begins to understand how each pair is a tool for living aKabbalistic life.bullet [Images/check.png] Chochmah and Binah: When a Kabbalist uses his mentalfaculties, he employs a combination of Chochmah (intuition) and (Binah) logicalanalysis). A Kabbalist may say that, at any given moment as he thinks, he’sgoing back and forth between Chochmah and Binah and between a combination of thetwo because some situations call for more intuition and others call for a morelogical analysis.bullet [Images/check.png] Chesed and Gevurah: In all relationships, in almosteverything a Kabbalist does, she’s constantly negotiating Chesed (giving) andGevurah (receiving) and finding the proper balance for every situation. As Imention in the section “Contraction: The impulse to receive” earlier in thischapter, the pairing of Chesed and Gevurah is clearly evident in a parent’srelationship with his or her child. When a parent relates to a child, in someways it’s a constant interchange between love and kindness and discipline. Inthe most basic sense, the parent has to find a balance between saying “yes” andsaying “no.”bullet [Images/check.png] Netzach and Hod: Particularly when a Kabbalist workson something in the world, he’s actively exercising the sefirot of Netzach (theurge to get things done) and Hod (persistence). Netzach prompts him toparticipate in the task before him, and Hod keeps the Kabbalist motivated andprovides the power and strength to see a job through to its conclusion.TRIADSFollowing are the three triads on the Tree of Life:bullet [Images/check.png] Chochmah (wisdom), Binah (understanding), and Da’at(knowledge): These three sefirot correspond to mental or intellectualactivities.bullet [Images/check.png] Chesed (lovingkindness), Gevurah (justice), andTiferet (harmony): These three sefirot comprise emotional lives.bullet [Images/check.png] Netzach (eternity), Hod (splendor), and Yesod(foundation): These three sefirot generally act on the physical world in whichpeople live.The three sefirot in each triad form their own groups because the three sefirotin each case have some common levels of connection. The sefirot are placed wherethey are on the Tree of Life because of these connections. In other words, thechart of the ten sefirot is a well-thought-out configuration. Every detail hasan inner logic that helps to reveal the wisdom contained within the chart.SEFIROT WITHIN SEFIROTKabbalistic tradition teaches that each of the ten sefirot has each of the tensefirot within it. For example, Chochmah hasbullet [Images/check.png] The Chochmah of Chochmahbullet [Images/check.png] The Binah of Chochmahbullet [Images/check.png] The Da’at of Chochmahbullet [Images/check.png] The Chesed of Chochmahbullet [Images/check.png] The Gevurah of Chochmahbullet [Images/check.png] The Tiferet of Chochmahbullet [Images/check.png] The Netzach of Chochmahbullet [Images/check.png] The Hod of Chochmahbullet [Images/check.png] The Yesod of Chochmahbullet [Images/check.png] The Malchut of ChochmahThis same pattern applies to each of the other sefirot. These connectionsillustrate the interdependence of the sefirot; none of them stand alone. Here’san example of how sefirot within sefirot works: You see that your small child isabout to touch a hot stove, and you realize in a split-second that the only wayto protect your child from getting burned is to slap her hand and thrust it awayfrom the stove. In that split-second, you experience the Gevurah of Chesed: Yoururge to protect your child comes from the lovingkindness you feel (Chesed), andyour decision to slap your child’s hand, both to protect it and to impress uponthe child that what she’s about to do isn’t good, is discipline and judgment(Gevurah). In other words, your act is one of Chesed, but the vehicle used toexpress that lovingkindness is Gevurah.PULLING THE STRINGS OF EXISTENCE: THE WORK OF THE KABBALISTKabbalists consider the ten sefirot, as a group, to be an all-inclusive systemdepicting the entirety of reality. In addition, they see the ten sefirot asorganic, meaning to say that just as the human body has various organs, each ofwhich has its own function, so too do the ten sefirot . Each has its ownfunction that is unique. Similarly, just as the various organs of the bodycomplement each other and work together, so too the ten sefirot work togetherand combine in various ways. You can say that, although the ten sefirot are thebasis of each of us, each person is different and unique based on the variouscombinations of sefirot. Some people have a tendency toward more of one sefirahthan another, which accounts for everyone’s individuality.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my teachers suggests that the way in which a person relates to thesefirot is similar to sitting in a control room: The ten sefirot are the“strings” of existence, and the Kabbalist uses those strings to effect change inthe world. For example, suppose that I’m working on something and am gettingtired. The end is in sight, though, and I just need to push myself a little toget the project done. Kabbalisticly speaking, I need to apply a little bit ofHod (persistence and holding on) to push through to the end of my work.There comes a point in the study of the sefirot when one almost feels like apostal worker sorting mail in front of a wall full of mail slots. With eachexperience, the Kabbalist sees the ten sefirot at work more clearly and can filethem into the slots on the Tree of Life.Kabbalists conceive of the universe as a downpour of divine plenty from abovethat constantly creates and sustains the world. This downpour comes in the formof the ten sefirot, which manifest out of the pure divine light that shines fromabove. God contracts and forms each of the sefirot and their combinations, andthis action results in the continuous creation of the world.Regarding the sefirot, however, Kabbalists teach that the relationship goes bothways between God and humans. Not only is there a downpour of divine light in theform of the ten sefirot, but also there’s a response from humans who use the tensefirot and show God their thoughts, deeds, and actions, which are really theten sefirot in various combinations. This is the basis of the idea of reward andpunishment. Humans use or abuse the world and experience the consequences oftheir deeds. Kabbalists conceive of a universe in which God is aware of everyminute detail of what is going on, so God knows how each person uses the tensefirot, either for the repair of the world or for its destruction.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]A Kabbalist isn’t conscious of the ten sefirot at all times. He doesn’t think tohimself, “This situation calls for a little bit of Binah. ” Rather, he meditateson the ten sefirot, their relationships to each other, and, in general, thewisdom embedded in the Tree of Life. In doing so, the Kabbalist learns so muchabout the nature of the sefirot and their relationships that he becomes a partof the system and the Tree of Life comes alive inside him. Sooner or later, theKabbalist puts down his books and goes out to meet the world. He doesn’t carrythe Tree of Life like a cookbook or a formula to tell him what the appropriateaction, thought, or manipulation of a sefirah is at each moment. Rather, thehope is that by studying the sefirot in enough depth, the Kabbalist becomes thesystem of the sefirot and is able to apply the proper combinationsspontaneously, for the most part.Imagine, for example, that you work in an office and have specific tasks toperform for your profession. You use the ten sefirot constantly; here are a fewexamples:bullet [Images/check.png] Binah: A task before you requires additional time tothink through the matter, research it, and discuss it with others.bullet [Images/check.png] Gevurah: As a supervisor, you notice that one coworkeris getting sloppy in his work. You have to sit down with him to discuss ways tobetter organize his work and perform with more precision.bullet [Images/check.png] Yesod: You realize that that coworker needs some closeattention and direction and may even need to be mentored.bullet [Images/check.png] Chochmah: You encounter a situation in which you haveto react not with your head but with your intuition.bullet [Images/check.png] Tiferet: You discover that you and your colleaguesaren’t getting along very well, and you need to get together to iron out yourdifferences and solve certain common problems.In other words, a Kabbalist can look at his or her actions and thoughts, comparethem to the system of the ten sefirot, and recognize their correspondence.Studying the ten sefirot and their relationships, especially with a masterteacher, begins to reveal the system of the ten sefirot as a profoundlyinsightful system for life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5EVERYTHING (EVEN A TRAFFIC JAM) IS FOR THE BESTIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Sorting out the idea that everything is for the bestbullet [Images/arrow.png] Knowing what to say and whenbullet [Images/arrow.png] Seeing things through the Kabbalistic lensbullet [Images/arrow.png] Participating in the repairing of the worldStudents of Kabbalah often find one important assumption — that everythinghappens for the best — to be the most difficult to grasp. Some people never getpast it and drop out of Kabbalah study as a result.The idea that everything happens for the best sounds outrageous given all thehorrific scenes on the news and family tragedies that occur every day. Itdoesn’t take long to formulate a great resistance to such an outrageous comment.However, this statement is one of the keys of Kabbalah.In this chapter, I explain the basic Kabbalistic mindset that leads to the viewthat everything that happens is for the best, and I discuss suggestions to helpaccustom you to see life in this way.HOW CAN EVERYTHING POSSIBLY BE FOR THE BEST?Everything is for the best? Even the Holocaust? Even the death of an innocentchild? You may be thinking, “If this is Kabbalah, I want nothing of it! It’snuts!”Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Throughout the study of Kabbalah, it’s important to mistrust the face value ofthings (see Chapter 4). Everything has a deeper meaning than what’s obvious atfirst glance. In a very real way, Kabbalah is the process of improving one’sability to see past the superficial into the depths of life itself. TheKabbalistic sages teach that people don’t see everything but can improve theirsight, both physical and spiritual insight, through the study and practice ofKabbalah.One Kabbalist teaches that Kabbalah needs to be “chewed on.” He makes theanalogy that a baby eats liquid food and often resists the transition to solidfood because he or she is forced to start chewing, and that’s more difficult.But fortunately, babies learn that mastering the art of chewing food bringsgreat benefit. Similarly, chewing on an outrageous statement such as “Everythingis for the best” is tough, but it just may bring some insight and spiritualreward that doesn’t show itself at first glance.So what does it mean when the Kabbalistic sages say that everything is for thebest?Understanding how magic tricks work is a great metaphor for addressing thisquestion. Imagine that a magician shows his hat to the audience, and it’s empty.After “proving” to the audience that there’s nothing in his hat, he reaches inand pulls out a rabbit. Needless to say, the stage magician didn’t actuallyproduce a rabbit out of nothing, but it appears that way to the audience becausethey don’t see everything.Perhaps the hat had a secret compartment that fooled the eye into thinking thatthe hat was entirely empty. Perhaps the rabbit was up the magician’s sleeve andhe dropped it into the hat as he reached in and grabbed it. Or perhaps what hetook out of the hat looked like a rabbit but was actually a cleverly disguiseddevice that could fold up into the hat as if it weren’t there and then inflateas the magician revealed it to the audience.Many theories can explain how it appears that a magician produces a rabbit outof nothing, but whatever the real reason, one thing is clear: The audiencedoesn’t see everything.The basic assumption of the Kabbalist is that humans only have a limitedcapacity to see the whole of existence. That’s why there are so many unsolvablequestions in the world. Kabbalists know that a paradox is one sign that they’regoing along the right path, and one of the primary paradoxes for the Kabbalistis understanding that the universe is beyond human understanding and thatacknowledging this fact actually increases one’s understanding.A contemporary Kabbalist teaches that news of a knife being stuck into someonesounds horrible until you discover that the knife was in the hands of a surgeonand was being used to help cure a patient. The assumption of the Kabbalist isthat even the horrible moments of life are steps in the direction of a futurethat will make all the suffering justified.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The student of Kabbalah encounters many metaphors, paradoxes, and storiesintended to soften the soil of the mind to begin to receive this idea ofeverything happening for the best. Remember that the very word “Kabbalah” comesfrom a Hebrew word meaning “to receive.” Kabbalistic tradition asks the seekerto receive an idea and try it on for size.GETTING THE WORDS RIGHT: GAM ZU L’TOVAHGam zu l’tovah (gahm zoo leh-toe -vah; this too is for the best) is an Aramaicexpression taught by Rabbi Akiva, a great Kabbalist who lived almost 2,000 yearsago. Kabbalists have used this phrase for many centuries to express the ideathat everything is for the best. This short expression contains an entirespiritual worldview that basically expresses the Kabbalistic assumption that Godknows what’s happening and why, and that all that happens will work out justfine. It’s not an expression that you say lightly, and there are some importantrestrictions on its use. But this brief Aramaic saying sums up a philosophy oflife based on faith in the eternal wisdom of God.WHEN BAD IS ACTUALLY GOODFor centuries, Kabbalists have shared important stories that express the viewthat things that seem bad can, from a more complete perspective, actually begood.Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]These stories (and others like them) aren’t meant to be taken literally; they’rejust stories. But in Jewish and Kabbalistic tradition, stories are vehicles forexpressing profound ideas and spiritual advice. Kabbalists tell these stories asa way to integrate the ideas embedded within them, in this case that everythingis for the best, into their lives and consciousness.RABBI AKIVA LOOKS FOR LODGINGFor centuries, the following story has served as a reminder to Kabbalists thatthey don’t see or understand everything and that one of the sacred tasks in lifeis to constantly reframe their experiences to allow into their minds and heartsthe possibility of a larger picture beyond human understanding.While traveling, the great Kabbalist Rabbi Akiva found himself in a town oneevening, and he inquired at the inn for a place to stay. When he was told thatthere was no room for him, he said, “Gam zu l’tovah, this is for the best.” Heinquired elsewhere in the neighborhood, and each time that he was told thatthere was no room for him, he responded, “Gam zu l’tovah, this is for the best.”Rabbi Akiva went to the woods on the outskirts of the town and set up a littlecamp for himself for the night. In the middle of the night, a wind blew out hiscandle, to which Rabbi Akiva responded, “Gam zu l’tovah, this is for the best.”A cat came along and killed the rooster that the rabbi had with him. Rabbi Akivareacted by saying, “Gam zu l’tovah, this is for the best.” Then a wild beastcame by and killed his donkey, and once again Rabbi Akiva said, “This is for thebest.”The next morning, when he awoke and went back into the town, he discovered thatthe inn and the other places where he had looked for lodging had been attackedby a band of robbers who caused physical damage to both property and people.If any of those places of lodging had accepted Rabbi Akiva the night before, heprobably would have been a victim as well. If his candle hadn’t blown out, hisrooster not been killed by the cat, and his donkey not been eaten by the wildbeast, he may have been detected in the woods and victimized by the robbers.RABBI ELIEZER AND ELIJAH THE PROPHETMany times in the Talmud, Kabbalists learn that some of the great Rabbinic sagesprayed with the desire to speak to Elijah the Prophet, who subsequently oftenappeared to them. The following story illustrates the idea that everything isfor the best, even though it often doesn’t seem that way. Sometimes, all thatyou need is a little more information, and you can turn the incident inside outand draw a very different conclusion.One day, Rabbi Eliezer prayed to the Almighty for a vision of Elijah. Elijah theProphet appeared before Rabbi Eliezer and said to him, “What can I do for you?”Rabbi Eliezer said, “I’d like to follow you around. I’d like to watch you doyour work, your work for the Holy One, Blessed be He, in the world. I just wantto follow you around and watch you do your work.”Elijah the Prophet said to Rabbi Eliezer, “Sorry, you can’t follow me around.You’ll have too many questions, and I don’t have time for your questions.” RabbiEliezer responded, “I promise I won’t ask any questions. Will you allow me thehonor of watching you do your work?” Elijah the Prophet agreed to thatcondition, and off they went.That night, the two were looking for lodging and saw a dilapidated shack. Theyapproached the shack and discovered a young, poor couple, impoverished andowning little else besides one cow, living there. Elijah the Prophet and RabbiEliezer approached the couple and asked them for lodging, and the young couplegreeted them warmly, welcomed them in, and gathered some straw to make the twostrangers as comfortable as possible. They offered their guests whatever theyhad, and Rabbi Eliezer and Elijah the Prophet spent the night.When he awoke the next morning, Rabbi Eliezer overheard Elijah the Prophetpraying to the Almighty, asking that the Almighty kill the cow. No sooner hadElijah the Prophet expressed this prayer than the cow suddenly died.Rabbi Eliezer was outraged and said to Elijah, “What did you do? Why did you askthe Almighty to take the life of the cow? They were such lovely people. Theyhave next to nothing. Why did you take their cow?” Elijah the Prophet looked atRabbi Eliezer and said, “See, you have so many questions. You have too manyquestions. I don’t have time for your questions.” Rabbi Eliezer, thoughconfused, quickly responded, “Please forgive me. I want to follow you. I won’task you any more questions.” Elijah gave him another chance, and off they went.The next evening they were looking for lodging and arrived at a big mansion.They knocked on the door, and the owner of the mansion came out, greeted themcoldly, and agreed that they could stay down in his cellar. He offered them nohuman warmth, no physical warmth, and no food, and down to the cellar they went.During the night, Rabbi Eliezer awoke upon hearing a commotion. He watched asElijah the Prophet patched up an area of the cellar wall that was unfinished andcrumbling.The next day, they continued traveling and arrived at a synagogue of wealthycongregants. The pews were made of gold and silver, and the people in thesynagogue were cold and unfriendly. When Elijah the Prophet and Rabbi Eliezerentered the synagogue, nobody greeted them, and nobody performed the mitzvah ofwelcoming guests. In fact, they noticed people whispering about them behindtheir backs. Before they left the synagogue, Elijah the Prophet looked at thecongregation and said, “I pray that you should all become leaders.”They entered a neighborhood that was impoverished. The people were living insqualor, but they were very lovely, sweet, warm, gentle people. Elijah theProphet looked at this neighborhood, looked at these people, and said, “I wantto bless you that one of you should be a leader.”It was at this point that Rabbi Eliezer couldn’t hold his questions in anylonger. He said to Elijah the Prophet, “I know that you’re going to send meaway. I know that you required me not to ask questions, but I beg you, please,can you give me some understanding of what you’ve been doing? I don’t understandanything that you’re doing. I beg you. Can you offer me some kind ofexplanation?”Elijah the Prophet looked at Rabbi Eliezer and said, “I’ll offer you someexplanation, but then you’ll have to leave. Remember the first night when weencountered that lovely yet poor couple living in their shack with their cow?And remember how outraged you were the next morning when you heard me praying tothe Holy One, Blessed is He, that he should kill the cow? What you didn’t knowwas that it was time for the wife to die. But I pleaded with Hashem: Don’t takethe wife, take the cow.”Elijah said, “You recall the next night when we were put in that rich man’s coldcellar? And you woke up puzzled when you saw that I was repairing his walls andfixing them up beautifully? I wasn’t doing that. I knew that there was atreasure buried within the walls. The man who owned that mansion didn’t deservethe mansion, let alone the treasure buried in the walls, so I patched andfinished up the walls nicely so that no one would ever discover that treasure.”Elijah the Prophet went on. “Remember the next day, when we went to thatsynagogue that was so wealthy, with gold and silver pews, but all the peoplewere so unfriendly? I noticed how confused you were when you thought that I’doffered them some big blessing by saying that they all should become greatleaders. That wasn’t a blessing; it was a curse. Anyone who has ever been in anorganization knows the chaos that results from everyone thinking that he or sheis a leader. I prayed that they all should become leaders. And then we went tothat poor neighborhood, and the people were so sweet and so lovely, and youwondered, in comparison to the earlier so-called ‘blessing,’ why I would justsay, ‘I bless you that one of you should be a leader.’ You see, that indeed wasa blessing. All that neighborhood really needed was one good, strong leader whocould take the people out of the poverty and squalor that they lived in.”Elijah the Prophet then said to Rabbi Eliezer, “Yes, you have to leave now, butplease don’t forget that what you see in the world is not the whole picture.It’s only part of the grand picture in the mind of the Almighty.”A 20TH-CENTURY KABBALIST WHO FOUND GOOD IN EVERYTHINGOne of the characteristics of a Kabbalist is his or her ability to see goodwithin everything. One of my favorite stories related to this idea has to dowith Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the first Chief Rabbi of Palestine during theBritish mandate. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, more commonly known as Rav Kook, wasa brilliant scholar, a great mystic, and a renowned Kabbalist.When he was appointed to be the first Chief Rabbi, Rav Kook had many critics,and many people protested his appointment. Rav Kook responded to his critics bysaying that they were right. He said that there were so many people in the worldand so many scholars in the holy city of Jerusalem who were greater than he was.He expressed his situation with an analogy of shoes that are too big. He saidthat the shoes of the Chief Rabbi position were bigger than he could fill andtherefore he needed to fill them with straw. As he explained, when straw is putinto shoes to fill them out, the hard and sharp edges of the straw oftenirritate the feet. Rav Kook concluded that his critics who believed that hewasn’t qualified to be Chief Rabbi were like straw in big shoes; just as theactual straw is irritating, the critics of Rav Kook were irritants to him. Butthey were necessary for him to be able to fill the shoes that he was asked towear.In other words, Rav Kook looked at the situation and found something positiveand good in his harsh critics. He reframed the situation in a way that revealedthe positive side of what was otherwise negative.AN IMPORTANT RULE ABOUT SAYING “EVERYTHING IS FOR THE BEST”The Kabbalistic sages certainly encourage Kabbalists to adopt the view thateverything in life is for the best and express that view by saying “Gam zul’tovah.” However, the sages also insist that Kabbalists never express thatphrase to others; you should only say to yourself. Kabbalists are forbidden bytradition and the basis of human compassion to say “Gam zu l’tovah” to asuffering person. Even if a person is a Kabbalist or simply a person with deepfaith in God, the compassionate thing to do is to resist saying that everythingis for the best.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalah recognizes human limitations; sometimes, a person’s faith is shakenwhen something bad happens. The compassionate thing is to offer comfort, nottheology, when a person is grieving.For example, if a friend falls and hurts his knee, I don’t say to him, “Gam zul’tovah, everything is for the best.” Rather, upon seeing someone who has fallenand gotten hurt, I do what I can to help my friend and relieve his pain andsuffering. But if I fall and hurt my own knee, I have the right and, in fact,the obligation to take all the suffering of my own life and use it for the best.When I fall and hurt my knee, saying “Gam zu l’tovah” is appropriate because thefall may very well be a warning from God that I need to be careful and slow downbefore a much larger and more devastating accident happens. The small scrapesand bruises of life actually can be used for the positive, but although aKabbalist tries to see things for the best, he doesn’t say that to a sufferingperson.An exception to the rule of not saying “Gam zu l’tovah” to others is made if theperson who’s suffering is a deep friend. Rather than cultivate lots of friends,the sages advise that each person should invest in one good, deep friendship.Two people who are friends on the deepest and most trusting levels are permittedand even encouraged to remind each other that this is the Almighty’s universeand that indeed everything is for the best.The great sages referred to the error of saying “Gam zu l’tovah” to others whoare suffering as “the sins of the friends of Job” because in the biblical bookof Job, Job suffers and his friends say to him, “Don’t you have faith thateverything is from God?”DON’T CONFUSE ACCEPTANCE WITH PASSIVITYBelief that everything happens for the best, faith, trust in God, clinging toGod, belief in God’s individual supervision of every detail of the world, andother related notions and concepts don’t mean that the Kabbalist is a passiveparticipant in life’s drama. Faith and trust in God for the Kabbalist doesn’tprompt passivity or an inactive attitude.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalists believe in the following:bullet [Images/check.png] Social action: The Kabbalist doesn’t look at the illsof the world and say, “Since I believe that God supervises everything, I need toleave everything just as it is.” Rather, the Kabbalist believes that his or herdesire to repair the world is part of God’s intention.bullet [Images/check.png] Fairness in business: A Kabbalist doesn’t believe that“whatever happens, happens” or that anything that one can get away with isobviously what God has allowed to happen. Rather, Kabbalists spend a lifetimestudying, and part of that study is the study of business ethics and the fairtreatment of others.bullet [Images/check.png] Animal rights: Kabbalistic tradition has strict lawsabout the imperativeness of treating animals as kindly as possible, relievingtheir suffering, and taking steps to help animals avoid any unnecessarysuffering.bullet [Images/check.png] Rights and responsibilities in marriage: Kabbalistsset high standards for this area of human experience. Marriage isn’t simply aunion between two people in love. Jewish law, which is the law that Kabbalistsspend a lifetime studying, is quite concerned about the rights of both husbandand wife. Couples fully explore these rights and agree to hold up theirindividual ends of responsibility before the Kabbalistic marriage ceremony takesplace.In so many aspects of life, Kabbalists walk an interesting path between trust inGod and His supervision of the world on the one hand and the active pursuit ofethical behavior and the repairing of the world on the other. These two extremesaren’t a contradiction but rather a profound paradox within which the Kabbalistlives his or her life.TRAINING ONESELF TO SEE LIKE A KABBALISTOne of the most important things that a Kabbalist does (and something that he orshe is actually doing constantly but that nobody sees) is inner activity. Inneractivity refers to the constant training to perceive all of life and all ofexistence as created by God and, therefore, for the best. As the great Kabbalistknown as the Baal Shem Tov is known to have said, “Not even a single blade ofgrass moves without God allowing it to happen.”To be a Kabbalist is to be a reframer, to take a situation and cultivate theview that everything to do with that situation is for the best. For example, ifI’m stuck in traffic, perhaps the traffic jam is preventing me from beinginvolved in an accident farther down the road. If I have a cold and need to stayin bed for a day or two, the recovery may be strengthening my immune system sothat I’m better able to fight an upcoming illness. Or the cold itself may bekeeping me home to avoid some other unforeseen stumbling block.Kabbalists learn and meditate on a number of key concepts, which I explain inthis section, throughout their lives. Each concept overlaps or is connected withanother, and taken together, they form the core theology of Kabbalah. But theterms that I explain in this section are more than abstract philosophicalconcepts. Kabbalists constantly remind themselves of these concepts (every dayand throughout life) and ultimately use them as strategies for understandingtheir lives and the world.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalist never tire of studying these concepts or thinking about them. On thecontrary, they’re as vital to a Kabbalist life as air, food, and love.Meditating on these concepts is the inner activity of the Kabbalist. Focusing onthese concepts daily, from the time one gets up in the morning until the timeone goes to sleep at night, infuses the Kabbalist’s life with a specialrelationship to the world.HAVING FAITHEmunah (eh-moo -nah; faith) is a broad and general term implying that a person,at the core of his or her being, believes in the existence of God.A BLESSING FOR BAD NEWSThe great sages invented formulas for saying different blessings over the manyjoys of life. For example, there are blessings to say before enjoying food and ablessing to say upon all kinds of enjoyments and pleasures. But there’s also ablessing to say when hearing of bad news: Baruch Dayan HaEmet (bah-rukh dah-yahnhah-em-et; blessed is the true judge). This blessing implies that, from a humanvantage point, the event may look and sound sad (and indeed is), but from God’svantage point, something else is going on that humans simply can’t see.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]A great Jewish philosopher and sage, Maimonides (also known as the Rambam), hasbeen an important teacher to Kabbalists for centuries. His masterpiece, theMishneh Torah, a work of 14 books that’s masterfully organized and has been saidto contain every concept in Jewish life, begins with the following:The foundation of all foundations, and the pillar of all wisdom is to know thatthere is God who brought into being all of existence. All the beings of theheavens, and earth, and what is between them came into existence only from thetruth of God’s being.This primary idea is that out of which everything else grows — that God existedbefore existence, that God created existence, and that God is the center of allexistence. The importance of getting the primary idea (a fundamental belief inGod) right is much like the exactness of launching a rocket ship to the moon; ifthe rocket’s aim is off just a little bit here on earth, by the time it gets tothe vicinity of the moon, the rocket will be a tremendous distance away from itstarget.Emunah implies two things:bullet [Images/check.png] Faith in Godbullet [Images/check.png] Honesty and integrity in one’s relations with othersFaith also implies a belief in the divine ownership of the world. Remindingoneself that this is God’s world is an expression of faith, and therefore, thosewho are conscientious about treating the earth in a healthy way are expressingtheir faith. The Kabbalist’s faith that the world is God’s leads to a desire totreat the natural world with respect. Loving behavior toward others reflects thesame kind of faith. If each human being is a creation of God, then treatingothers appropriately is an acknowledgment of the creator.BEING CERTAIN THAT GOD IS PERFECTBitachon (bih-tah-khone; security, trust, confidence) is an aspect of thebroader concept of faith and signifies the deepest certainty that God knows whatHe is doing, that God is perfect, that nothing happens without God allowing itto happen, and that the Kabbalist has confidence in God’s infinite wisdom.Kabbalists connect the notion of bitachon with the sefirah of Netzach, which Iexplain in detail in Chapter 4. It has been observed that Netzach, the urge toget things done, is related to bitachon because when someone is activelyexpressing confidence in God, he or she gets the sense that each person has amission in life and must actively pursue that mission in order to manifest whatGod wants. In a sense, bitachon as confidence reflects both a confidence in Godand a confidence in one’s own ability to find oneself and express oneself in theway that God intended.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The concept of bitachon implies that whatever happens to a Kabbalist isultimately for the good. Because Kabbalists believe that God is good, everythingthat God makes happen or allows to happen is also good.Many books on the subject of faith and related concepts remind Kabbalists thatfaith and trust is really a form of service to God. The Kabbalist activelytrusts in God and, through that trust, believes that his or her soul istransformed and purified. Profound trust in God opens the Kabbalist up togodliness and holiness.ATTACHING YOURSELF TO GOD (AND NEVER LETTING GO)In the Christian world, the term is “communion.” For the Kabbalist, it’sd’veykut (dih-vey-koot; clinging), which is a similar uniting with the Holy Oneand not letting go. For Kabbalists, d’veykut is a high and deep stage ofspiritual development where the seeker attaches himself or herself to God andexchanges individuality for a profound partnership with the Holy One. The forcebehind d’veykut is the love of God and desire for intimacy or closeness withGod.When a Kabbalist develops a strong sense of d’veykut, the seemingly vast numberof requirements and commandments in her life transform themselves from externalburdens into more and more opportunities to devote herself to God. Just as younglovers are of infinite service to their loved ones, the Kabbalist who has trued’veykut sees the requests that God makes as opportunities to express her lovefor the Almighty.For example, the Kabbalist views the requirements of the Sabbath (see Chapter10) to be part of the gift of the Sabbath, not burdensome restrictions asoutsiders may see them. Similarly, Kabbalists don’t see the dos and don’ts ofthe Torah as oppressive but rather as opportunities throughout one’s day andlife to connect with God.The concept of d’veykut also informs the Kabbalist’s attitude toward her owndeath because she believes that one of death’s great rewards is the opportunityto merge with God in an even deeper and more complete way than is possibleduring life. D’veykut in this lifetime is fleeting and incomplete, but completed’veykut is attainable after death.KNOWING THAT YOU’RE UNDER GOD’S SUPERVISIONHashgacha pratit (hash-gah -kah prah -teet; private supervision, at Providence)is the Kabbalistic concept that every individual being is under the privatesupervision of God.Some people believe that there is no God, whereas others believe that Godcreated the world but then left it alone to its own devices. Kabbalists maintainthat God rules the world by hashgacha pratit; the infinite God is constantlyinvolved in every detail of existence, from the largest cataclysm to the tiniestmovement of an insect. (Flip to Chapter 16 for more on God’s ongoing supervisionof the creation as a whole.)As I say many times in this book, Kabbalists must reconcile the following twopoints of a major paradox:bullet [Images/check.png] The highest expression of the Divine in the world ishumankind, and humankind functions with free will.bullet [Images/check.png] Nothing happens in the world without God allowing itto happen.Hashgacha pratit doesn’t contradict the belief in free will. Rather, it insiststhat God is actively involved in the supervision of everything, while at thesame time allows for free will. Kabbalists may not always understand thisparadox, but they know that it’s the wisdom received from tradition.HOPING FOR THE BESTMany people are familiar with the Hebrew word mazal (mah-zal; fate) because ofthe popular expression “Mazal Tov.” Although the expression is commonly thoughtto mean “good luck,” it actually means “good fate.” Wishing a person mazal is away of hoping that the person experiences only good things as his or her lifeunfolds.Even though everything is for the best, wishing a person good fate is anexpression of hope that what happens to the person is easy to recognize as “forthe best” and not one of the challenging and difficult moments when thinkingthat what has happened may be tough.UNDERSTANDING THAT THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASONBashert (bah-shairt ) is a general concept that implies that things happen for areason. Kabbalists use it most commonly in connection with matchmaking.Within the matchmaking world, when a Kabbalist is looking for a future spouse,he says, “I’m looking for my bashert.” What he means is that he’s looking forthe one whom God has picked out for him. A story known by all serious Kabbalahstudents tells of a Roman who asks one of the Jewish sages “If God created theworld in six days, what has He been doing since then?” The sage’s answer isthat, among other things, God is making matches. To refer to somebody as yourbashert is to say that you believe that this person is your partner selected byGod, deliberately and for a purpose.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]Of course, in today’s society, people ask, “If God makes matches, why are thereso many divorces?” One of my teachers of Kabbalah says that God makes matches,but no one knows why He makes the particular matches that He does. God has Hisown motives for doing things, and matches aren’t necessarily intended to provideindividuals with eternal bliss. A couple can be matched because of many thingsother than passion and romance. For example, many matches occur for theirfruitful results (that is, for the children they produce).PICKING UP THE PIECES: IN THE BEGINNING A VESSEL WAS SHATTEREDThe 16th-century Rabbi Isaac Luria (known among Kabbalists as the Ari; seeChapter 18) caused a revolution in Kabbalistic thought and today is consideredto be, without exception, the greatest Kabbalist who ever lived. His ideas, waysof thinking, and metaphors have become the standard accepted notions thatKabbalists have studied for the last five centuries.One of the Ari’s most basic notions describes, metaphorically, the basis for thecreation of the world. As the Ari explained it, God created a vessel (like avase, cup, or container of some sort) and then poured His infinite, divine lightinto this vessel. The vessel couldn’t contain the infinite light and shattered.The broken pieces of the vessel scattered, and the stuff of creation — all itsmany bits and pieces — are actually the shards produced by that cataclysmicshattering. The shards still contained evidence of the original divine light.BEING “CHOSEN” MEANS GREATER RESPONSIBILITYThe Torah teaches that the Jewish people are a nation of priests. This notion,which is the basis for the too often misunderstood phrase “the chosen people,”in no way means that Jews are superior. This distorted idea has been spread farand wide but is nowhere to be found in Jewish literature or Jewish teachings.The idea that the children of Israel should see themselves as a “nation ofpriests” simply refers to Jewish consciousness that the entire world is holy andthat the nation of priests is required to relate to all the details in theuniverse as though they were holy and in need of sanctification.Everything has the potential for holiness, and therefore, everything needs to berelated to with a certain degree of holiness. The notion of the chosen peoplerefers to the idea that the Jewish people have a greater responsibility andburden to relate to the Divine than others do.In other words, the world in which Kabbalists live, in each of its details,contains divine light. Whatever a Kabbalist relates to, whether it be solid,liquid, or gas, good or evil, physical or spiritual, contains divine light. Andaccording to Kabbalistic tradition, each person is responsible for breaking openthe pieces to release the light contained within. Because everything in theworld contains divine light, all situations have good (divine light) hiddenwithin them. The Kabbalist’s task — and everyone else’s, for that matter — is tosearch for or recognize that divine light and let it shine.By integrating the shattered vessel metaphor into one’s consciousness, all lifeand all existence has the potential for sanctity through the release of divinesparks from the divine light inside. Kabbalists make the assumption that theworld needs to be repaired (see Chapters 7 and 8 for more on this concept), thatGod created a world that is incomplete and flawed. By revealing the divine lightthat’s hidden in everything, the Kabbalist participates in the correcting of theworld, leading to a time when God will be obvious and known to all people.Within Kabbalistic literature, the sanctity of life is evident in the everydayact of eating. God created a world in which various species eat other species.One of the reasons that Kabbalistic tradition requires the Kabbalist to recitevarious blessings before eating various foods is to help to release the divinesparks embedded within the food.For the Kabbalist, eating isn’t just an effort to satisfy one’s appetite. It’s areleasing of divine light contained within everything. If one eats with theproper intention, the food is the source not only of physical nutrients neededto survive but also divine light that offers spiritual nourishment and thefortitude to go on to perform acts of lovingkindness.SEEING BREAD AS A TRIBUTE TO HUMAN CREATIVITYThe blessings that Kabbalists recite before eating various foods (see Chapter 9)are divided into categories. For example, one blessing is appropriate wheneating fruit from a tree, and another blessing is recited for baked goods likecookies and cakes, but not for bread. Bread has it’s own special blessing.However, if a Kabbalist sits down to a meal that consists of many differentkinds of foods and includes bread, it’s not necessary to recite the variousblessings on the different kinds of foods. Rather, the Kabbalist should beginhis or her meal with the blessing to be recited before eating bread and thenenjoy the meal. In a sense, the blessing for bread contains all the otherblessings.So why is bread and the blessing said before eating bread of such high status?Bread represents human creativity because it’s made through the creativity andingenuity of the people who take various God-given ingredients, combine them,and create the staff of life. Eating a pear, string beans, milk, or chicken ismerely taking the food that God gives. But when the Kabbalist eats bread, he’sacknowledging the ability of human beings to combine the elements of the worldand to create something new.Kabbalists consider this ability to create to be a divine spark within humans.Bread is the finest example within the human diet of that expression ofcreativity, and therefore the blessing said before eating bread is sufficientfor the entire meal regardless of how many other kinds of foods are consumed.This example also points to the Kabbalistic notion of repairing the world.Kabbalists gather the gifts that God has given and try to combine them in a waythat will improve the world. By gathering the ingredients to make bread, peopleexercise their ability to create the tools necessary to improve, build, andraise the level of the world. Each day, Kabbalists need to be aware that theworld requires rectifying and things need to be put into their proper places.Kabbalists assume that the world is mixed up; all too often, things that aresmall are considered big, things that are big are considered small, things thatare important are considered unimportant, and things that are unimportant areconsidered important. The Kabbalist’s job is to put everything into its properproportion for the sake of the health of the world.FIGURING OUT INDIVIDUAL DIVINE ASSIGNMENTSKabbalistic tradition teaches that it’s each person’s responsibility to find hisor her own place in the world. As I explain in Chapter 6, each human being isabsolutely unique. In principle, each person has unique elements that belong tono one else. Of course many people share various qualities, but in totality, notwo people are identical.Growing out of this idea of divine individual assignments, of course, is thenotion that each person has his or her own strengths and weaknesses, abilitiesand inclinations. Kabbalists relate divine assignments to the biblical story ofAdam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. They teach that just as God put Adam and Evein the garden to tend it, the world is the garden of existence, and each personhas his or her own part of the garden to tend. The world is a large place, andthere’s lots of work to do everywhere. It isn’t any individual’s job to tend theentire world but rather to find that part of the world that he or she mustrepair.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]You may be asking, “How does one discover one’s true purpose in life, one’sdivine assignment?” One of my teachers suggests that a good first step “issimply to quiet down.” Sometimes the business of life means that people actuallymiss hearing or seeing clearly the tasks that are obviously before them and inwhich they must participate.Another method of discovering one’s task is through prayer. Within personalprayers, Kabbalists often make a request to God to help reveal what they shouldbe doing in life.But nobody suggests that uncovering one’s purpose in life is easy. Each personhas free will, and the expression of that free will through the choicespresented all the time can be daunting. That’s where Kabbalah teachers come in.When a Kabbalah teacher is connected to his or her students in an intimatespiritual way, the teacher is often a great help in guiding his or her student.(For more on studying with a teacher, flip to Chapter 14.)Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]Another way to approach the question of one’s true purpose in life is torecognize one’s natural abilities. Natural abilities are usually a hint (or evenmore than a hint) of what a person should be busy doing. Ultimately, people canonly hope that they’ve found their purposes. Kabbalists believe that throughsincere prayer, and diligent study, you can attain the wisdom necessary to findthe right path.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]EVERYONE IS A LETTER IN THE TORAHOne of my teachers shares the metaphor that each person should see himself orherself as an individual letter in the Torah. The Torah is a scroll consistingof the Five Books of Moses, and it contains 304,805 letters. Locating oneself inthe Torah is another way of saying that a person needs to find his or her place.An ancient text teaches that God looked into the Torah and created the world.The Torah is a blueprint for the world, and it’s the Kabbalist’s task in life tofind his or her location in that blueprint."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6OUR BODIES DON’T HAVE SOULS; OUR SOULS HAVE BODIESIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Situating souls and bodiesbullet [Images/arrow.png] Navigating the four worlds that Kabbalists live insimultaneouslybullet [Images/arrow.png] Exploring the five levels of the human soulSome people think that humans are just bodies; human bodies are born, they live,and they die. Some people say that humans are bodies alright — but they’rebodies that have souls. Kabbalists reject both ideas and say that humans aren’tbodies with souls, they’re souls that have bodies.What’s the difference between a body with a soul and a soul with a body?Kabbalists believe that, contrary to what humans see on the outside, human soulsare much greater than human bodies. Most important is the Kabbalistic view thatthat our bodies are temporary; our souls are eternal. The world that we see withour eyes and perceive with our senses is only part of creation. To be aKabbalist is to train your senses to remember how much more you are than justyour body.Kabbalists know that their souls exist, they existed before the body they nowhave, and they’ll exist after this current body is used up. The soul behaves incertain ways, is nourished by certain things, and must learn how to get alongwith its partner and instrument, the body. In this chapter, I look at the soul,how it functions, how to take care of it, and what its job is in Kabbalisticterms.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]According to Kabbalistic tradition, human beings aren’t just the result of twoparents but rather are the product of a partnership of three. The mother andfather give the baby its physical being, and God gives the baby its spiritualaspect. This idea, by the way, is alluded to in the opening chapters of theTorah, in the book of Genesis, where the description of the creation of manincludes the image of God breathing into Adam’s nostrils. The great sagesthroughout the generations have understood this divine breath to be the soul, orthe spiritual aspect of the person. The two parents are responsible, however,for both a child’s physical and spiritual nourishment. Just as it’s important totreat your body right, your soul also needs care and attention. When a Kabbalistrealizes that he or she is more soul than body, the attention focused on thesoul grows in intensity.A SPARK OF GOD IN EVERYONEKabbalists believe that bodies are physical aspects and souls are spiritualaspects, and as such, bodies are temporary, and souls are eternal.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The idea that souls exist prior to birth and will also exist after death is afundamental element of the Kabbalistic notion of the soul. According toKabbalah, when God sends a soul into the world, God in a sense “houses” the soulin a body. The body is the instrument of the soul, and the soul uses the bodyduring its incarnation and lifetime.When the body is used up, so to speak, it’s buried in the ground, and the soulcontinues on its way (see Chapter 7). Although tradition speaks of all creationbeing a manifestation of God, the soul in its deepest aspect is God Himself. Ina sense, the world is generally considered something other than God, but thedeepest part of the soul is part of God.Kabbalistic tradition also carries the idea that, in its essence, the soul hasthe potential for some of the actual capacity of God. This capacity is theability to move, to choose, to build, and to destroy — essentially, the capacityto create.GETTING TO THE SOUL OF THE MATTERTo begin the process of understanding the human soul, you need to understandthree foundational ideas about the soul:bullet [Images/check.png] The soul is ultimately beyond human understanding.bullet [Images/check.png] Each human soul is really a fragment or a part of asingle soul that’s made up of the sum of all souls.bullet [Images/check.png] Although all souls are part of one general human soul,each fragment is unique and irreplaceable and works with all the other souls tobecome itself.THE SOUL? IT’S BEYOND MEOf absolute and fundamental importance to understanding the soul is recognizingthat, ultimately, grasping the true nature of the soul is absolutely andcategorically impossible. Although there’s much that people can say about thesoul, and although many great sages have speculated on the way of the soul, thesoul is one of those divinely created entities that’s simply beyond humancomprehension.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]It’s vital that the student of Kabbalah acknowledge at the outset that fullcomprehension of the soul is, by definition, impossible. Remember, however,that, many times in the study of Kabbalah, the acknowledgment of theimpossibility of grasping a subject is a paradoxically giant step in thedirection of understanding that very same impossible-to-comprehend subject.WE’RE ALL PART OF ONE GREAT SOULIn Kabbalah, human beings are part of one great soul that exists in the world.On the most fundamental level, there’s only one soul in the world, and eachindividual soul is a part of that greater soul. That’s not to say that humansshouldn’t also see themselves as halves of the souls they create with theirspouses. And the concept of a great soul doesn’t interfere with the idea ofvarious levels or parts of the individual soul that I talk about in thischapter.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]Many Kabbalists have attempted to describe the soul in terms of light. God’sdivine light shines outward, and one of the rays of light that comes out of Godis the one great soul. Kabbalah teachers often suggest this means that everysoul is a fragment of the divine light. The soul is a spark of the Divine, andpart of its task in the world is to experience and live from the humility ofbeing but a piece of the one soul.WE’RE ALL UNIQUE, THOUGH, TOOAlso fundamental to the Kabbalistic view of the human soul is the basic ideathat no two souls are the same. Every soul has its own function and its ownpath. Every soul has its own capacity, and nobody can replace another soul.A basic principle in Judaism and Kabbalistic tradition is the profound regardfor human life and the view that each person is irreplaceable. In fact,Kabbalists teach that each person has a part to play in the perfection of theworld and that, even if you can do my part better than I can, my soul mustcomplete it’s journey in this lifetime by doing it’s part. Nobody can replaceanyone else.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalistic tradition also teaches that each individual soul is the result ofspecial and unique combinations of the ten sefirot within that person. Keep inmind that the Tree of Life, the chart of the sefirot, is both the blueprint ofthe world as well as the blueprint of the structure and components of the soul.Each soul consists of the ten sefirot in various combinations and permutations.Kabbalists believe that the reason people are all different from each other inpersonality is because each is a unique combination of the sefirot and each soultends toward certain sefirot more than others. Here are some examples (I coverthe ten sefirot in depth in Chapter 4):bullet [Images/check.png] Netzach is the sefirah that manifests as the urge toget things done. People wouldn’t be productive without it, but too much Netzachproduces a workaholic.bullet [Images/check.png] Chochmah is intuition, and Binah is logical analysis.It’s common to find that some people make decisions based on the feel of asituation while others gather as much information and base their decision on the“facts” they’ve brought together.DESCENT FOR THE SAKE OF ASCENSION — THAT’S LIFEIt has been said that if only the soul were allowed to stay in heaven and baskin the divine light, its experience would be far more pleasant than it iswrapped in a human body and spending a life in the physical world. After all,without a body, the soul is free; it doesn’t get entangled in the temptations oflife. But it’s fundamental to Kabbalistic belief that even though the soul’sjourney in the world is a great risk and can result in damage of the world andof the soul itself, the risk is worthwhile based on a notion described as adescent for the sake of ascension.The soul descends into the world because the world gives the soul an opportunityto purify itself and raise itself to a level that it didn’t exist at before itmade its descent. This process, which is actually the process by which peoplecome to know God, is the goal of life. The more people purify themselves andraise their spiritual levels, the less of a barrier there is between humans andtheir perception, experience, and ultimate knowledge of God. According toKabbalah, God created humans to give them pleasure, and there’s no greaterpleasure than to know God. Think of the soul as a roller coaster: The only way aroller coaster can go very high is if it builds momentum by going very low veryquickly.NO PAIN, NO GAINNo doubt you’ve heard the expression, “No pain, no gain.” When people go to agym, they usually come out with sore muscles. The sore muscles are actuallybroken down muscle tissue, but the breaking down of the muscle tissue duringexercise leads to a rebuilding of that tissue to be even stronger than it wasbefore.So it is with the soul, which descends into this world of trials andtribulations and ends up with even greater spiritual achievement than it couldhave had without the descent. This is one of the secrets of Kabbalah: God givespeople trials in life as a way for them to purify themselves and ascend to greatheights of spiritual consciousness.LEAVING GOD ONLY TO COME BACK AGAINAlthough describing the soul as being housed in the body paints a usefulpicture, Kabbalistic tradition urges students to attempt to conceive of the soulin slightly different terms.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]As one of my teachers says, the soul isn’t caged in the body, and humansshouldn’t conceive of the soul as a point in space. Rather, the soul is a line,like the line of light created by a flashlight or a beacon, and the source ofthat line of light is God. When the line of light shines on a person, it goesthrough the person and continues on after passing through the body. In otherwords, the soul isn’t in one particular point in space because it’s a line ofbeing.As I mention earlier in this chapter, the soul exists before the body and willexist after the body is long gone. To extend the metaphor even farther, someKabbalists teach that the soul is a circle. The soul is a manifestation of Godthat shines outward, picks up a human body, and then continues around the circleback to its source, God.INTRODUCING THE FOUR WORLDS OF KABBALAHKabbalists view reality as consisting of four fundamental worlds. In Hebrew, theterm used is olam (oh-lam ; world). In order to understand the Kabbalisticconception of the soul, which has five levels (see the section, “Going Up? TheSoul’s Journey of Five Levels,” later in this chapter), you first have toexplore the notion of the four worlds. The four worlds correspond to the firstfour levels of the soul (the fifth level is the deepest level of the soul, theplace where Kabbalists say that the soul is actually a part of God). Humans area microcosm of the universe; just as the universe consists of four worlds, thehuman soul has four corresponding levels.Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]Don’t think of these four worlds as four planets or four galaxies. WhenKabbalists speak of “worlds,” they’re not talking about different locations butrather different dimensions of being. These four worlds are four general levelsof reality, and Kabbalists conceive of the human consciousness as constantlygoing up and down and back and forth between worlds.Following are the four worlds, according to Kabbalistic tradition:bullet [Images/check.png] Atzilut (ah-tzee-loot): The world of emanation; theworld of the spiritbullet [Images/check.png] Beriyah (bree-ah): The world of creation; the world ofthe intellect, where ideas residebullet [Images/check.png] Yetzirah (yeh-tzeer-ah): The world of formation; theworld of emotionsbullet [Images/check.png] Assiyah (ah-see-yah): The world of action; theconcrete, physical worldEach of the four worlds is reflected in each person, who has a spiritual nature,an intellectual nature, an emotional side, and physicality. Each person residesin all four worlds at the same time, but one’s consciousness or focus tends togo back and forth among them. For example, there are times when an individual ismostly feeling something emotionally, and at that moment, his consciousnessresides in the world of emotion, which is the world of formation.Similarly, sometimes a person is actively engaged in thinking, in which case hissoul is dwelling in the world of creation. And when a person is ravenouslyhungry and just gobbled down a plate of food to satisfy a physical hunger,Kabbalisticly, his consciousness is residing mostly in the physical world, inthe world of action.Each of the four worlds is parallel to the others, which makes it easy for one’sconsciousness to bounce back and forth from one to the other over the course ofeach day. Interestingly, the word “parallel” in modern Hebrew comes from thesame root as the word for “Kabbalah.”THE PROGRESSION OF THE FOUR WORLDSA progression exists from atzilut (emanation) to beriah (creation), to yetzirah(formation), and to asiyah (action). One way to imagine this progression is tocompare it to a source of light. Imagine God as the source of divine light, withlight pouring out of God in all directions. From there, the following happens:1. In creating the world, God emanates divine light and begins the process ofcreation. The light emanating from God begins as a boundless emanation until Godtakes that boundless light and makes something out of it, which is creation.2. God takes the process of creation a step further by beginning to formwhatever it is that God has in mind. The light, therefore, goes from emanationto creation and then to formation. In the formation stage, God refines thecreation by beginning form something.3. The result of creation and then formation is the world or the universeitself.4. After formation, the process is more or less complete, and the world that Godhas emanated, created, and formed is able to act or be. This is the world ofaction.Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]The world of atzilut (emanation), which is sometimes referred to as nearness toGod, is the most abstract of the four worlds, but it’s also considered to be thehighest of the four worlds. When Kabbalists use the word “higher” to describesomething, they mean that something is closer to God, more abstract, clearer,and more transparent than something that’s lower. Atzilut is the most spiritualof the four worlds, and some Kabbalists go so far as to say that the world ofemanation isn’t really a world but is itself God.CONSIDERING THE FOUR REALMS OF HUMAN EXISTENCEAnother way of looking at Kabbalah’s four worlds in order to understand them isto relate them to the four realms of human experience: the physical, theemotional, the intellectual, and the spiritual.Each human being exists simultaneously in these four levels:bullet [Images/check.png] Physical: Every person has a physical aspect thatincludes the body and the physical senses. This aspect corresponds to the worldof action, in which the human being acts within the physical world.bullet [Images/check.png] Emotional: Every person lives within the world ofemotions, which is more spiritual than the physical world. All have within thema wide array of emotions of seemingly infinite gradations. The world of emotionsthat each person experiences is said to reside in the world of formation.bullet [Images/check.png] Intellectual: Every person has an intellectual lifethat exists above the world of emotions. Just as the world of emotions is not aphysical world, so too the world of ideas is an abstract spiritual world.bullet [Images/check.png] Spiritual: Above the intellectual world of each humanbeing is the world of emanation. Sometimes this realm isn’t even considered aworld; because it’s so abstract and transparent, some consider it to be GodHimself.Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]You can look at the four worlds from either direction or order: from emanationto creation to formation to action, or from action to formation to creation toemanation. Similarly, when speaking of the four levels of worlds in terms ofaspects of a person, you can view them from physical to emotional tointellectual to spiritual, or the other way around.WHO INHABITS EACH WORLD?One of the ways to best understand each of the four words is to see thedifferences among them, so Kabbalists often speak of the beings that reside ineach world and help to distinguish them from each other. To start, humans residein the world of asiyah (action), and angels reside in the world of yetzirah(formation).Kabbalists create angels constantly with every thought, deed, and inclination.Within the world of the angels, Kabbalists conceive of both positive andnegative angels.A good deed obviously creates a positive charge in the universe, and a bad deedcreates a negative charge. The positive and negative angels attach themselvesalmost parasitically to the soul. The more positive deeds, the more positiveangels are attached to the soul, and the more negative deeds, the more negativeangels are attached to the soul. When a person dies and drops his or her body,the soul remains and continues its work but still carries the positive ornegative nonphysical essences that the human being created. (See Chapter 8 formore on Kabbalistic angels.)Beings referred to as seraphs reside in the world of beriah (creation). One wayto imagine an intellectual being in the world of ideas is to think of abrainstorming session at a business that depends upon creativity. Two peopleeach express an idea, and those two ideas connect with each other and give birthto a new idea that neither participant would have been able to think of on hisor her own.In the highest world, atzilut (emanation), there are no individual beings atall; it’s a profoundly abstract world filled with clarity and transparency.GOING UP? THE SOUL’S JOURNEY OF FIVE LEVELSKabbalists conceive of the soul as having five levels. Each level has a name andrepresents aspects of the divine soul in man. The five levels of the soul are1. Nefesh (neh-fesh): The lowest and most basic aspect of the soul. Sometimes,the word “nefesh” is used more generally to refer to the soul. Nefesh animatesexistence and gives the human body its ability to move, its life force, and itsability to reproduce. The level of the soul called nefesh corresponds to theworld of action.People living on the level of nefesh share it with animals. These people simplymove, breathe, and are alive.2. Ruach (roo-akh): The second level of the soul. Ruach is often translated asspirit. The level of the soul called ruach corresponds to the world of formationand emotions.People living on the level of ruach not only are alive but also experience therange of human emotions including love, compassion, humility, and awe.3. Neshama (neh-shah-mah): The third level of the soul. The word “neshama” issometimes used informally to refer to the soul in general, but neshama reallyrefers to the higher soul, corresponding to the world of creation and ideas.People living on the level of neshama think, meditate on God, and reach for anintellectual grasp of the world and the Divine.4. Chaya (khah-yah): The fourth level of the soul. The level called chayacorresponds to that which goes on in the spiritual world of emanation.People living on the level of chaya pierce through the worlds of emotion andideas and enter spiritual realms that are almost impossible to describe. Theybegin to grasp spiritual reality and see that they’re far more than bodies thatare born, live, and die.5. Yechida (yeh-khee-dah): The fifth level of the soul. This level is called themost inward point of the divine spark. Kabbalists see yechida as being beyondall the four worlds (see the section “Introducing the Four Worlds of Kabbalah”)and the actual point in which the soul and the Divine make contact.People living on the level of yechida have reached the point of contact betweenthe soul and God.PROOF OF KABBALAH’S ANCIENT TRADITIONThe five levels of the soul are a good example of the fact that Kabbalah is anancient tradition. Too often, modern scholars think that Kabbalistic traditionbegan sometime relatively late in Jewish history — some say perhaps in the 1200swhile others point to the 1500s.Of course, they’re wrong. For example, one can see a discussion of the fivelevels of the soul in the early Rabbinic literature, whose tradition is over2,000 years old. A Rabbinic commentary on the book of Genesis known as BereshitRabbah talks about the Rabbinic conception of God breathing into Adam’snostrils. This commentary includes reference to these five levels of the souland represents the fact that the ancient mystical tradition is indeed ancient.Kabbalists teach that most people go up and down, down and up, from the lowestlevel of the soul upward toward God. People don’t stay on one level all thetime. A person can work hard spiritually and thereby raise his or herconsciousness and generally live on one plane of existence. But even that person— and everyone else — has moments of consciousness that are higher and othermoments that are lower. The human consciousness never stays in one place.Sometimes one is all wrapped up in his or her emotions, whereas at other times,one’s consciousness resides on the level of ideas. According to Kabbalah, theworld of ideas is higher than the world of emotions; emotions should be ruled byideas, not the other way around.As a result of great struggle and intense spiritual work, the consciousnesses ofrare individuals reside on the level of chaya. Rather than be ruled by theiremotions or intellectual ideas, those who are on the level of chaya have a graspof spiritual reality. A person can’t reside on the level of yechida because it’sthe point of intersection of a person and God. Someone fully on the level ofyechida is someone who no longer exists and has fully merged into God.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]What’s the point of all these levels? Well, the point of the levels is the pointof life, and the point of life, according to Kabbalah, is to realize one’sspiritual potential and ultimately connect with the Divine within oneself. Inother words, the purpose of life is for one’s soul to perfect itself, and theway to that perfection is to identify with the highest level of consciousness aspossible. The soul uses its instrument, the body, to travel up and back amongthe levels. This constant movement, up and down, back and forth, is the essenceof the process of purification and results in greater and greater Da’at,knowledge of God."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7LIKE DÉJÀ VU ALL OVER AGAIN: REINCARNATION IN KABBALAHIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Getting to the root of reincarnationbullet [Images/arrow.png] Taking a different view of birth and deathbullet [Images/arrow.png] Realizing the daily significance of reincarnation forKabbalistsIt may (or may not) come as a surprise to you to find that Kabbalists believe inreincarnation. And not only do they believe in it, but they take it prettyseriously, too. To a Kabbalist, reincarnation explains why people are born, whythey die, and how they should live their lives while they’re here on earth.Many people claim that reincarnation isn’t a part of Jewish tradition. Forexample, if you were to ask a number of rabbis whether Jews believe inreincarnation, you’d get all kinds of answers, including the frequent responsesof “No, we don’t” and “A few sages did believe in this, but it isn’t a centralteaching of Jewish tradition.” These answers are wrong, pure and simple.Scholars have documented that the greatest of the Jewish sages believed, wrote,and taught about reincarnation. The works left by the formative minds behindKabbalah expressly teach a belief in reincarnation Even the revered andauthoritative author of the standard Code of Jewish Law, Rabbi Joseph Karo,believed in reincarnation.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]The first time I met my teacher, I asked him why ideas I have encountered in mydabbling in Eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism seem so similar toideas in Kabbalah. Not that all the details are the same, but the Eastern andKabbalistic sources on reincarnation generally describe the same concept andprocess. When I said to my Teacher, “The ideas are so similar; how can it be?”he said, “It would be stranger if it were otherwise.” In other words, it wouldbe unusual if the various world religions were different in many of their basicteachings. After all, truth is truth, and nobody has a monopoly on it.In this chapter, I explain the concept of reincarnation as it relates toKabbalistic teachings, the purpose of reincarnation, how Kabbalists view lifeand death, and the significance of reincarnation in a Kabbalist’s daily life.WHAT IS REINCARNATION?The Hebrew term for reincarnation, the term used by Kabbalists over thecenturies, is Gilgul Ha-nefesh (gil -gool hah-neh -fesh). It’s made of twowords: Ha-nefesh means “the soul,” and gilgul actually means “rolling” or“recycling.” Sometimes reincarnation is referred to in the plural, gilgulha’ne’shamot (gil- gool hah-neh-sha-mote; the reincarnation of souls).Following are basic steps in the process of reincarnation:1. God creates your soul.2. Your soul exists before your particular body.3. The soul enters your body 40 days after conception.4. Your soul tries to figure out what its job is here on earth.5. The soul, with the help of your body, tries to complete its task and to helprepair the world. At the same time, the soul, in its connection with thephysical world through your body also experiences the exhilaration of lifeitself, and enjoys and savors it. (The opportunity to enjoy life and the abilityto savor it are seen by Kabbalists as divine gifts.)6. If you haven’t finished the curriculum, which consists of the trials Godgives you to solve, your soul comes back for more — it’s reincarnated.LIFE WITH A PURPOSEIn the eyes of a Kabbalist, reincarnation is an important part of theunderstanding of who we humans are and what we’re doing here. Kabbalah teachesthat a human being isn’t just the result of sex between a mother and father. Asthe sages have taught, the mother and father provide parts of the physical body,and God provides the life force, the soul (also known as consciousness ).Kabbalists understand birth as a partnership of three: the mother, the father,and the Holy One. Each contributes something.Kabbalah teaches that God’s dream of a world that perfects itself is the goal ofcreation. One of the reasons people are born is to participate in the repairingof the world (see Chapter 8). The good news is if your soul doesn’t finish itsassignment, it comes back and continues its work. As it is written in the greatKabbalistic text, the Zohar, as long as a person is unsuccessful in his purposein this world, the Holy One, blessed be He, uproots him and “replants” him overand over again. Eventually, after enough lives, enough incarnations, the soulfulfills its task and waits for the rest of the souls in the world to completetheir tasks.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]AN ANCIENT TALE ABOUT THE SOULA well-known story that has been told and retold by Kabbalists for almost 2,000years involves Rabbi Meir, a student of Rabbi Akiva, one of the greatestKabbalists of all time. The story is that one Sabbath many centuries ago, RabbiMeir asked his wife, an extraordinary woman named Beruria, if she had seen theirtwo sons because he didn’t see them in the house of prayer. Beruria knew thattheir two sons had died but didn’t want to tell her husband until after theSabbath, to allow him a few more hours of the delight brought by the gift of theSabbath given by God each week. After the Sabbath was over, Rabbi Meir onceagain asked Beruria where their sons were. Before answering, Beruria said thatshe wanted to ask her husband a legal question. She asked, “If jewels aredeposited with a person for safekeeping and one day the owner comes to retrievehis gems, is there an obligation to return them?” Rabbi Meir said, “Of course.”At that point, Beruria said to her husband, “He who gave us our two gems ondeposit has come to retrieve them.”THE SOUL’S TASKS: TO REPAIR THE WORLD AND ITSELFOne of Kabbalah’s fundamental principles is that each of us has a unique task.My task isn’t your task, and your task isn’t mine. And even if you can do mytask better than me, it still isn’t yours. For example, it’s my job to write abook about Kabbalah. Even if you can write a better book than I can, that maynot be what you’re here for.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]A person doesn’t need to be conscious of his task in life in order to fulfillit. He can go through his entire life totally unaware of all these Kabbalisticideas and unaware that the task of life is to figure out his task. Many peoplejust have an intuitive sense of what they should do in the world. Regardless oftheir motivation, by doing what they’re inclined to do, they’re actually in theprocess of completing their divine assignments.There are a number of possibilities for each soul:bullet [Images/check.png] The soul enters the world, understands its assignment,and fulfills it.bullet [Images/check.png] The soul doesn’t complete its task and has to returnto try to finish its work.bullet [Images/check.png] The soul doesn’t complete its task and does damage tothe world.bullet [Images/check.png] The soul enters the world and is itself damaged duringits life.The first case, in which the soul understands and fulfills its assignment, issaid to be quite rare. In most cases, the soul must come back and either finishits assignment, repair the part of the world that it damaged in the past, orrepair itself.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of the issues with no consensus among Kabbalists is just how many chanceseach soul gets. Many say three. One of my Kabbalah teachers echoes a view heldby many Kabbalists in history: As long as you make progress in a lifetime, youget another chance even if you don’t finish God’s assignment.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]Kabbalists believe that some souls make such terrible choices and do suchextreme damage to the world that they’re beyond repair. The Zohar (see Chapter13) states that those souls who are unworthy and don’t achieve their purposesultimately will be regarded as though they never even existed. They will end upas “ashes under the feet of the righteous.”In addition to its work in repairing the world, the soul also raises andpurifies itself. According to Kabbalah, the soul’s work on the world and itswork on itself aren’t two different activities — they happen simultaneously. Forexample, suppose you’re walking down the street and see a person in need askingfor a coin. By giving that person some money, you’re helping to repair theworld, but you’re also refining yourself. The inner process of deciding to feelcompassion for a person in need, as well as the decision to actually dosomething concrete about it, help to create new habits and patterns of behavior.You may struggle with questions such as “Should I give money to this person?”“Shouldn’t the person get a job?” and “What if the person is faking it?”Ultimately, as the Kabbalistic sages have taught for centuries, it isn’t yourbusiness to judge the person; it’s your business to give when a seemingly needyperson asks. This process of introspection and its result of giving charity isan example of the process of refining the soul, raising it up, and gettingcloser to the goal of the soul’s final destination: basking in the Light of God.WE’VE ALL BEEN HERE BEFOREReincarnation, for the Kabbalist, provides the framework for understanding somuch about life. In fact, Kabbalists believe that the trials and challenges thatpeople face in their lives are a result of what they may have left unfinished ormay even have damaged during a previous lifetime.Sometimes, people can recall brief glimpses of their past incarnations. Forexample, many people have a sense that they’re reincarnations of people who weremurdered during the Holocaust. Beyond the Ashes (A.R.E. Press) is an account ofa contemporary rabbi’s personal encounters with hundreds of people from allwalks of life who have visions, dreams, and flashbacks that seem to be comingfrom another life during the Holocaust.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Reincarnation isn’t a failure; most souls simply don’t complete the entirecurriculum in one lifetime.Many have asked why God puts the soul through so much. Why does the soul have tofigure out its assignment? Why does God allow the soul to take the terrible riskof entering the world to possibly get damaged or do damage? God’s reason for thecreation of the universe is to bestow pleasure on us. If all of the answers werejust given to us, where would the pleasure be? But the soul descends in order tomake an ascent to greater heights. It is only through work, risks, trials, andaccomplishments that true joy occurs.BIRTH AND DEATH (ALSO KNOWN AS HOMECOMING AND GRADUATION)Kabbalists believe that before a soul enters the world, it’s in Heaven, baskingin God’s presence and learning divine wisdom. At a certain point (see thesidebar “When soul meets body” for details), God sends the soul into the world.Most souls aren’t here for the first time and bear the legacy of previousexistences. But some souls are new or young souls, sent by God into the worldfor some divine reason.According to Kabbalah, the process of birth causes the soul to forget the divinewisdom it has learned in Heaven. According to the Talmud, just before a baby isborn, an angel taps the baby on the mouth to push it from one world to the next.The tap creates the philtrum (the little notch between the upper lip and nose)and also causes the soul to forget what it has learned. The message of thisstory is that, in life, education has more to do with remembering what onealready knows rather than learning something new.WHEN SOUL MEETS BODYKabbalists explain that God connects the soul with its body on the 40th dayafter conception. This is a Kabbalistic belief that goes back over 2,000 years.Incidentally, the idea that the fetus does not have a soul until it is 40 daysold has an important impact on Jewish legal opinions concerning abortion and theemerging field of stem cell research. Rabbinic authorities feel that there is avast difference between an abortion before 40 days and after 40 days, due to thesoul’s arrival at that time.After death, the soul returns to God and once again basks in God’s divine light.Souls that need to return to finish their work go back into the world. Soulsthat have finished their work return to God and wait for the perfection of theworld as a whole.WELCOME BACK, BABY!For a Kabbalist, a birth is really like a welcome home party. Kabbalists believethat your soul existed before the body you currently have. When a baby is born,its soul is returning to this world for another go at fulfilling its mission ofcompleting or fixing something in the world or in itself.When a baby boy is born, Kabbalists practice a custom known as Shalom Zachor(shah -lome zakh-hor; peace little boy). It’s a simple enough Kabbalisticpractice that you can easily do. (In fact, if you have sons, you may havealready done it without even knowing it!) A Shalom Zachor is essentially acelebration marked by a festive meal that’s held on the Friday night of thefirst Sabbath after the child’s birth.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]To live the life of a Kabbalist, everything you do must be enhanced and madecomplete with kavanah (consciousness and attention). So when the baby is born,just as for most other significant moments in life, a ritual helps theparticipants focus their attention on what the life cycle event represents. Thebirth of a baby isn’t just a happy occasion or the answer to a couple’s prayers.Rather, it’s the moment that God sends another soul back into the world to doits work.At a Shalom Zachor, family, friends, and neighbors celebrate the baby’s arrival.The occasion is called a Shalom Zachor because participants, by participating inthe celebration, wish the baby luck by saying, “Shalom Zachor.” Kabbalistsrecognize that the soul of the baby has been thrust into the physical world,with its life of struggle and potential suffering. They hope that the soulnavigates this life well and achieves its goals during this incarnation.The question has often been asked: Why is there a Shalom Zachor for a baby boyand not a baby girl? One commentator points to a teaching in the Talmud statingthat a woman is considered as if she is already circumcised. From birth she isconsidered complete. Females, according to Jewish tradition, are by definitionon a higher spiritual level. The “Shalom Zachor” is for baby boys who need extraencouragement on the spiritual journey. In traditional Jewish circles today, analternative celebration named Simchat Bat (sim- khaht bot; joy for a daughter)is a party or special spiritual gathering in honor of the birth of a girl. Evenwhen not called a Simchat Bat, the birth of a girl is surely a cause forcelebration among Kabbalists.THE KABBALISTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF BIRTHDAYSPerhaps the greatest teacher of Kabbalah in the past 100 years was RabbiMenachem Mendel Schneerson, known by millions of people around the world as theRebbe (meaning great spiritual teacher) or the Lubavitcher Rebbe (Lubavitch isthe town in Russia where his ancestors came from). The Rebbe encouraged thecelebration of birthdays because a birthday is the anniversary of the soul’sreentry into the world. On his birthday, a person should remind himself that thesoul reincarnates and gets additional chances to complete its task; he shouldfeel as though the world was created just for him. In addition, a birthday is atime to look at one’s life with extra care and introspection and to resolve towork harder to fulfill one’s task in the world.WHEN DEATH COMES A-KNOCKIN’: A KABBALIST’S GRADUATION DAYKabbalists believe that at a certain point in every person’s life, he or shegets a visit from the Angel of Death, known in Hebrew as the Malach HaMavet (mah-lakh hah-mah -vet), whose job it is to separate the body from the soul. Thebody is buried in the ground, and the soul continues on in its spiritualjourney.Because death is a graduation into another life, Kabbalists follow a strictcustom of burying a body within 24 hours of death. (Jews follow this custom asmuch as possible to this day.) This practice is connected to the belief inreincarnation. The Talmud (see Chapter 13) teaches that keeping the bodyunburied after the soul leaves the body and the body remains without breath isforbidden. And the Zohar adds that perhaps God decrees that a person undergoesreincarnation on the day that he dies. As long as the body remains unburied, thesoul can neither go into the presence of the Holy One nor be transferred intoanother body.The great Kabbalistic sages teach that when the body and soul separate, theexperience varies for different types of people:bullet [Images/check.png] For people who are basically good in their lives, theseparation is as gentle as drawing a hair from milk.bullet [Images/check.png] For people who are wicked, the separation is like thewhirling waters at the entrance to a canal. Some sages teach that the separationof the body and soul of a wicked person is like pulling a rope with a spikedball out of the throat.RECITING A DEATH BLESSINGJust as there’s a Kabbalistic response to a birth, Kabbalists recite a blessingwhen they hear of a person’s death. The blessing, in Hebrew, is Baruch dayanemet (bah-rukh da-yahn eh- met; blessed is the true judge). In other words, whenKabbalists find out that God has sent the Angel of Death to do its job, theyacknowledge and trust that even though they don’t know why it was that soul’stime to leave the world, God had a good reason.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my Kabbalah teachers taught me that death doesn’t frighten the piousKabbalist because he or she has faith that death is simply a transition from onelife into another.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Death isn’t a tragedy; it’s a graduation ceremony. With each incarnation, thesoul learns more and continues to purify itself in order to reach its goal.Kabbalists believe that although the death of someone is a sad occasion forloved ones, God knows what He is doing.REALIZING DEATH IS NOT DEATH, SUFFERING IS NOT SUFFERINGWhen students of Kabbalah study anything, they always search for a deepermeaning and a more profound level of understanding. For example, Kabbalah asksus to believe that everything that happens in the world has a reason, and thatfrom a Kabbalistic view, everything is for the best (see Chapter 5). So whenKabbalists hear news about a death, they first acknowledge that everything is inGod’s hands. God knows everything and God knows best.Some people are on such a high level of consciousness, understand things sodeeply, and have such great faith that God knows why everything happens thatthey don’t even experience bad news as bad.Kabbalistic tradition is, in many ways, a series of teachings designed to raisea person’s consciousness, and what this often means is to see beyond the surfaceof things (see Chapter 4). Both death and suffering are good examples of thisprocess.Death is generally considered “bad news.” From the point of view of family andfriends of the deceased, the occasion of death can be a traumatic one. Death hasacquired a sense of finality. Death, to many, means the end.But not to a Kabbalist. Kabbalah stresses that death is a transition. It ishardly the end; it is not the end for the body, which merges into the earth, andit is not the end for the soul, which is eternal and continues on its path.Suffering, perhaps even more than death, is thought to be a negative word. But,to a Kabbalist, everything has a purpose, everything contains God, and everydescent is for the sake of ascension. Though it’s easy to simply reactnegatively to suffering, in Kabbalah, suffering can be seen as a divine gift.UNDERSTANDING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF REINCARNATION TO KABBALAHAwareness of the process of reincarnation changes the whole picture of life forthe Kabbalist. In particular:bullet [Images/check.png] Reincarnation helps the Kabbalist see life assomething other than a random event. In other words, life has meaning eventhough you may not see it.bullet [Images/check.png] Reincarnation includes the lesson that each life has adivine purpose.bullet [Images/check.png] Reincarnation gives hope and optimism to those whoselives fall short of their goals.bullet [Images/check.png] Reincarnation transforms death from a tragedy intoanother step along the path of the soul’s journey.bullet [Images/check.png] Reincarnation helps explain why siblings are often sodifferent even though they’re raised in the same family by the same parents.bullet [Images/check.png] Reincarnation helps explain why sometimes you may feelas if you’ve known someone before (we probably have!).In this section, I explain the Kabbalistic idea that life is like a classroom.The trials, assignments, and challenges of life are the very ways that the soulmakes progress.TENDING GOD’S GARDENRemember [Images/Remember.jpg]The great Kabbalists teach that humankind must see itself as being in God’sgarden and then treat the garden properly by helping to perfect the world. Thismessage is the result of Kabbalists looking closely at the details, down to theindividual words and letters, of the story of Creation in the book of Genesis inthe Bible (see Chapter 16). One such detail is that Adam and Eve find themselvesin a garden. Their fate, as the story goes, is to tend that garden. (You canview the huge body of Jewish law as a manual for the proper care of the world.After all, the word “Torah” comes from the Hebrew root that means instruction.)Kabbalists believe that God wants people to enjoy the world and take pleasurefrom life. Thus, when a soul comes back to the world to try again to achieve itstask, it isn’t being punished but rather is being given a great opportunity.MORE TO LIFE AND DEATH THAN MEETS THE EYE: A REINCARNATION PARABLEWhen studying Kabbalah what you see is almost never what you get. Kabbalahteaches people to look beneath the surface of things. So birth isn’t reallybirth — it’s a chance to finish what you didn’t complete during your last life.And death isn’t really death — it’s a graduation.Kabbalistic tradition contains countless parables that teach important ideas.One parable sheds a lot of light on the subject of reincarnation.Imagine twins who are developing nicely and peacefully in their mother’s womb.The twins have it great: Things are serene, and they’re both fed through a tubeand are well nourished. But as nice as it is, they feel themselves droppinglower and lower and begin to wonder what will happen to them when they move toofar down and fall out of their world. One of the infants believes in thespiritual tradition that promises another existence after the current one. Hehas faith in his belief even though there’s no evidence for it. The other twinis a skeptic and doesn’t believe in anything without hard evidence. He doesn’tbelieve his brother’s stories about another existence; rather, he believes thatmere imagination is proof of nothing.The first brother says, “After our death here, there will be a new great world.We will eat through our mouths. Also, we will be able to see far distances withour eyes. We will stand up straight and tall.” The skeptical brother replies,“What you are saying is nonsense; it’s all your imagination. There is nofoundation for this belief. It is an elaborate defense mechanism. There is onlythis world. There is no next world.” The first twin asks his nonbelievingbrother what he thinks will happen to them. The second brother replies, “We willgo with a bang. Our world will collapse, and we will sink into oblivion. A blackvoid. An end to consciousness.”Suddenly the water inside the womb bursts. The womb convulses with upheaval andturmoil. Everything lets loose, and the brothers move faster and faster, lowerand lower. All of the sudden, the brother with faith falls out of the womb ashis nonbelieving brother watches in horror. He cries, “Why did this happen?! Whydid he fall into that terrible abyss? I knew that death is horrible.” While he’sso filled with sorrow, he hears a cry from his brother who has fallen out of theworld and exclaims, “Oh no! What a horrible end! Just as I predicted!”The nonbelieving brother mourns his “dead” brother, but things outside the wombare much different from what he thinks. The baby’s cry is a sign of health andvigor. The exit from the womb is the birth of the body; the exit from the bodyis the rebirth of the soul.VIEWING LIFE AS A CLASSROOMThe soul that has fulfilled its task and has done all that it’s supposed to do,creating or repairing some part of the world, can bask in God’s presence untilthe whole world is perfected. But many souls don’t do all the proper things,they misuse forces in the world, or they’re injured in some way. After the deathof the body, these souls return to the world (entering another fetus at age 40days) and try again to figure out their tasks and to do them successfully.For a soul, learning how to do things properly isn’t easy. The fact that it’s alifelong pursuit is the reason study is so important to the Kabbalist (seeChapter 13). Kabbalists study every day in an effort to do the following:bullet [Images/check.png] Understand the spiritual ideas that Kabbalah teachesbullet [Images/check.png] Apply these basic principles to improve behaviorbullet [Images/check.png] Participate with the great sages in trying to figureout what to do in lifeUSING REINCARNATION AS A GUIDE FOR LIVINGEach and every day, Kabbalists ask themselves the following questions:bullet [Images/check.png] What is my life’s work and divine assignment?The question, “What should I do with my life?” is one that is asked by many. Forsome, it’s asked early in life and never revisited. For others, questioning thepurpose of life is a daily occurrence. Kabbalists are encouraged to almostconstantly evaluate and re-evaluate their paths to make sure that life doesn’tjust slip away but rather is filled with the tasks that God put you here to doand learn (see Chapter 8).bullet [Images/check.png] Am I doing my assignment well?For a Kabbalist, this question is a daily one. Every night, Kabbalists are urgedto look at the day that has just passed with the hope that the actions performedand the thoughts that came to mind were healthy, appropriate, and productive.Particularly during the Days of Awe, between the holy days of Rosh Hashannah andYom Kippur, a Kabbalist asks himself and God for an evaluation and hopes for agood one (see Chapter 10).bullet [Images/check.png] Is my current suffering the result of deeds done inprevious incarnations?In Kabbalah, the advice given to a person who is suffering is to try to look athis deeds and wonder what failings have prompted the suffering. If you come upempty-handed after considering your deeds, your soul may be suffering due tomisdeeds in a prior lifetime. In either case, the suffering person, according toKabbalah, should avoid bitterness and cultivate trust that God will reveal thedivine wisdom behind all events (see Chapter 9).bullet [Images/check.png] How can I live a life that insures the least amount ofbad karma?A Kabbalist’s life is a conscious life. Every moment a person needs to be awakeand aware, and must try with the greatest efforts to integrate the wisdom thathas been acquired into life’s activities, all in order to avoid the negativeconsequences that follow from misdeeds (see Chapter 9)."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8INSTANT KARMA’S GONNA GET YOUIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Understanding the Kabbalistic view of karmabullet [Images/arrow.png] Crediting the presence and work of angelsbullet [Images/arrow.png] Getting to the root of sufferingYou may not be happy about this, but God knows everything that you do. Yes,everything. (Kind of makes you cringe, doesn’t it?) And everything you docreates angels — good angels and bad angels. In this chapter, you discover whypeople give birth to angels and how this impacts both present lives and futureincarnations.In addition, you look closely at the eternal question of why suffering exists inthe world. There are two main reasons for human suffering:bullet [Images/check.png] Suffering is the result of people’s misdeeds, thekarma they create.bullet [Images/check.png] God gives people suffering deliberately to test themand to provide them with the lessons that they learn from that suffering.Everything depends on your inner attitude toward suffering. Kabbalah offers aprofound perspective on suffering and provides people with strategies for copingwith suffering — and using suffering for the good.EVERYTHING HAS MEANING — EVERYTHINGTo put it simply, Kabbalistic tradition teaches that everything has meaning.Every thought, every inclination, every gesture, every word, and every actionhas significance in the universe.One way to look at this concept is to see life as a scale in which each act thatyou do can tip the scale one way or the other. If the next thing you do or thinkis positive, the scale tips in the right direction. In the same way, if whatyou’re about to do or think is negative, the scale tips in the wrong direction.The sages teach that this awareness of meaning must be kept in one’s mind at alltimes.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my teachers offers an excellent analogy for people who feel that even ifthere is a God, then certainly God isn’t interested in “little ol’ me.” Afterall, why would the Creator of this vast universe be interested or even aware ofone small speck? Surely if there is a God, He (or She) must have far betterthings to do than to be concerned with one individual on a small planet in thevastness of space.My teacher points out that the reason this line of thinking is in error isbecause people too often think of God and His universe in the same way that theythink of the CEO of a huge corporation. Using this model, you can be fairlycertain that a busy CEO is hardly interested in which pencils an assistant inone of thousands of offices is purchasing. The CEO has far more important thingsto focus on and almost surely doesn’t even know the name of the assistant oreven that this person exists. The CEO is busy with the board of directors andwith the major players in the corporation and lets the people far below him onthe organizational ladder worry about the little things. Applying the logic ofthis corporation analogy to the awareness of God and meaning in actions producesthe idea that, if there is a God, He must be busy with the movement of galaxiesand the creation of universes and certainly isn’t concerned with the affairs ofa tiny speck in the universe.The problem lies in the fact that God isn’t CEO of the universe but rather isinfinite. In fact, Kabbalists often refer to God as “the Infinite, blessed isHe” (see Chapter 17). In the nature of infinity, nothing is closer or fartheraway than anything else, and nothing is larger or smaller; against the infinite,everything is of the same proportion. Therefore, when people, as finiteindividuals, make even a slight gesture with their little fingers, to God it isof the same proportion as the largest cataclysm.By seeing God as infinite, Kabbalists understand that God is aware of everything— from the largest cataclysm to the smallest gesture. The great Kabbalist andfounder of the Hasidic movement Rabbi Israel, known as “the Master of the GoodName,” is known to have said that not even a blade of grass moves without Godbeing aware of it and, in fact, allowing it to happen.While this might seem impossible or beyond our grasp, One can look to theinvention of the personal computer to begin to see that such a notion is not anunreasonable at all. After all, we are really just at the very beginnings of thedevelopment of the computer, and yet a small computers sitting on a desk is ableto keep track of billions and billions of pieces of information. That beingcase, it does not seem unreasonable at all to imagine that the Creator of theuniverse can do the same, and far more.The notion that every thought, gesture, inclination, and action has meaningcertainly has its impact on the decisions Kabbalists make. Human beings arebelieved to be the only forces in the world having free choice, so thisKabbalistic belief often serves to help people take the high road rather thanthe low road when a situation or choice confronts them.ANGELS: THE KABBALISTIC KEY TO KARMAThe Hindu belief in karma is similar to the Kabbalistic tradition. Karmarepresents the idea that the good and the evil that a person does will returnwith inevitable results, either in this life or in a later one. As the popularsaying indicates, “What goes around comes around.” This notion, in Kabbalah, isconnected to the idea of angels.Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]In order to better understand this section’s discussion of angels, you need tokeep a couple of points in mind:bullet [Images/check.png] For the most part, angels are beyond humancomprehension. Most of what people know about angels comes not from theirperceptions but rather from tradition. As one of my teachers put it, “There isno way to grasp an angel.” Nevertheless, Kabbalah teaches that throughouthistory there have always been certain individuals who live on a higher plane ofconsciousness and therefore have access to information and vague perceptions.Those individuals, by sharing their visions from higher planes, help us to graspthe unknowable.bullet [Images/check.png] Existence consists of four fundamental worlds thatdon’t exist in different places but, rather, in what some Kabbalists call“different dimensions of being.” These worlds intersect and interact with eachother. Human beings are the inhabitants of the World of Action. Angels are theinhabitants of the World of Formation, which is the world just above the Word ofAction. (Refer to Chapter 3 for a full discussion of the four fundamentalWorlds.)AN ANGEL ISN’T A BLONDE GIRL WITH WINGSOften, when one wants to learn something new, the first task is to get rid ofold notions in order to make room for new ones. Bob Dylan sang, “I don’t want tolearn what I gotta unlearn,” but unfortunately, much of learning ends up beingunlearning. I find that I often have to get rid of old notions to clear my mindand make room for new ideas.At the beginning of discussions of the angels in the Kabbalistic tradition, manyof my students over the years have said, “I thought that only Christians believein angels.” This misconception is in part due to angels being depicted as littlecreatures (usually children) with wings and appearing on Christmas trees.In the Kabbalistic tradition, angels don’t have wings. During a lecture given byone of my teachers, he gave the advice that if you ever encounter an angel sentby God, you may want to run in the other direction because unlike a common imageof angels as sweet little girls with wings, the angels that appear in the holytexts studied by Kabbalists are often fierce and foreboding.HOW ANGELS ARE MADEThe Hebrew world for “angel” is malach (mah -lakh; messenger). As opposed tohuman beings who live in the World of Action and exercise free will, angels liveon a different plane and have no such free will. Instead, the angel serves as amessenger; each angel has a particular nature and a specific assignment or task.Within this general categorization of angels, Kabbalah conceives of two kinds ofangels:bullet [Images/check.png] Angels made by God: The angels created by God serve aparticular function. One such angel, for example, is the Malach Hamavet(mah-lakh hah-mah-vet; Angel of Death). God created the Angel of Death to enterthe World of Action and to do the task of separating a person’s soul from hisbody (see Chapter 7).bullet [Images/check.png] Angels made by humans: According to Kabbalistictradition, human beings produce angels, or spiritual charges, in the universewhen they think, dream, speak, feel, and act. The angels produced are, in asense, parasitically attached to people. So even though you can’t see them,Kabbalah teaches you to think of all the angels you produce as being alive andattached to your soul.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalistic tradition speaks of good angels and bad angels. An angry wordcreates a different kind of spiritual charge than a kind word, but that isn’t tosay that an angry word is a bad word. Sometimes anger is appropriate, andsometimes it isn’t. The same is true for love. There are times when love (andthe angel it creates) is healthy and appropriate for the moment or the occasion,and there are other times when love is inappropriate.MAKING CORRECTIONS WITH THE HELP OF ANGELSKabbalists believe that when a person dies, the human combination of body andsoul separates. The body returns to the earth, and the soul, which is eternal,continues on (see Chapter 6). The soul carries with it the myriad of good andbad angels that it gave birth to throughout its life. The significance of thisis that when a person decides to change, to improve, and to alter the course ofhis or her life, the change switches the direction of the bad angels that werecreated in the past.TURNING WITH TESHUVAHThis process of change, which is the expression of free will and creativity, iscalled teshuvah (teh-shoo -vah; turning). (Teshuvah is often inaccuratelytranslated as repentance.) When a person does something regretful, God gives himor her an opportunity to change and be redeemed. Teshuvah implies that it’spossible to change the past. Even though time flows in one direction, teshuvahis a spiritual concept that allows for people to go back in time, in a sense.Needless to say, it’s impossible actually to go back in time. If I punch you inthe nose, there’s no way that I can undo my punch. What teshuvah implies,however, is that I can change the significance of the punch. I may have punchedyou out of inappropriate anger, and surely there are better ways to deal withmost situations than to throw a punch at someone’s nose.Teshuvah allows me to learn from my mistakes, so much so that the punch thrownin error prompts such regret within my soul that I’m transformed as a person.The very act of punching you inappropriately, followed by my deep and sincereregret, becomes the very inspiration that puts me on a positive track forever.From one point of view, the punch was surely inappropriate, but as theKabbalists teach, with deep and sincere teshuvah, a real transformation canoccur. As the great Kabbalistic sages teach, sincere teshuvah allows one’s sinsto become one’s merits!TRANSFORMING ANGELSKabbalists throughout the ages have believed that the person who makes an errorand then chooses freely and sincerely to mend his ways is actually on a higherspiritual level than a saint. How can this possibly be? How can a saint, who isthe essence of goodness and purity and who experiences no temptations andtherefore commits no errors, possibly be lower than a person who has madecountless errors in his or her life, even if he or she does express sincereregret?FRIDAY NIGHT ANGELSAn almost 2,000-year-old Kabbalist teaching tells of two angels — one good andone bad — who accompany a person home from the synagogue on Friday night. Thesetwo angels are not the kind of angel that you create through your thoughts anddeeds. Rather, these angels are of the other type: They are created by God andare part of the structure of the world. When the person arrives home to find theSabbath candles lit, the table set, and the beds made, the good angel says, “Mayit be God’s will that the next Sabbath should be the same.” And against hiswill, the bad angel must answer, “Amen.” If the candles aren’t lit and the tableisn’t set, the bad angel says, “May it be God’s will that the next Sabbathshould be the same,” and, against his will, the good angel answers, “Amen.”Knowledge of these two angels and how they function motivates Kabbalists tofulfill the traditional obligations on the Sabbath. After all, to get a badangel to say “amen” when a Kabbalist fulfills the divine command to observe thetraditions of the Sabbath is an extra bonus and something in which to takespecial pleasure.THE ALL-TIME ANGEL HALL OF FAMEEvery night, Kabbalists recite a special prayer that refers to the four greatangels: “To my right Michael and to my left Gabriel, in front of me Uriel andbehind me Raphael, and over my head God’s Shekhinah [the presence of God].”One source of this prayer is a text that reads, “As the Holy One blessed be Hecreated four winds (directions) and four banners (for Israel’s army), so alsodid He make four angels to surround His Throne — Michael, Gabriel, Uriel andRaphael. Michael is on its right, Uriel on its left, Gabriel in front, andRaphael in the rear.”In Kabbalistic literature, the four angels surround God’s throne and shed theirlight on the four winds of heaven.bullet [Images/check.png] Michael is the guardian angel of Israel. (Each nationhas a guardian angel.)bullet [Images/check.png] Gabriel is God’s messenger on numerous missions andthe constant defender of the Jewish people.bullet [Images/check.png] Uriel, meaning “light of God,” is the medium by whichthe knowledge of God comes to man.bullet [Images/check.png] Raphael is responsible for healing. His name appearsrepeatedly on amulets and incantations. In the Talmud, Raphael is one of theangels who visits Abraham after his circumcision.The answer lies in the fact that people are constantly giving birth to angels ofall sorts. The person who has committed many errors has given birth to countlessbad, or negative, angels. However, if that person’s teshuvah is sincere, thenall the countless negative angels parasitically attached to his or her soul aretransformed into positive angels. So the sinner who turns has at his or herdisposal a vast army of formerly negative angels and can thereby work as a hugepositive force in the universe. This change could never have happened if theperson hadn’t made errors to begin with.Warning(bomb) [Images/Warning(bomb).jpg]Unfortunately, this notion of transforming angels is one that has been abused bycertain misguided Kabbalists of the past. These Kabbalists believed that if it’spossible to transform negative angels into positive ones and thereby establishthemselves on a high spiritual level, then why not commit sins intentionally andthen express regret after-the-fact as a way to build up one’s arsenal ofpositive angels? The faulty logic, of course, lies in the fact that God knowseveryone’s thoughts and schemes and therefore can detect such a dishonest plot.SUFFERING HURTS BUT ISN’T RANDOM: THE KABBALISTIC VIEWPerhaps the most profound questions in life and certainly the most difficult tountangle are “Why would God create a universe with so much suffering? If, infact, God is all-powerful, why didn’t He create a world of eternal bliss?”Indeed, many people have given up their beliefs in God or avoided believingaltogether simply by looking at the world or turning on the evening news andseeing what troubles exist. If there’s a God, they think, why in the world isn’tHe doing anything about this?In this section, I clue you in to the reasons Kabbalists believe people suffertrials in their lives and how they can learn and benefit from those trials.WHAT GOES AROUND COME AROUNDKabbalistic tradition explores two terms:bullet [Images/check.png] Olam ha’zeh (oh-lam hah-zeh; this world)bullet [Images/check.png] Olam ha’ba (oh-lam hah-bah; the world to come)Kabbalists have taught for centuries that all deeds prompt either a reward or apunishment. With this world and the world to come in mind, you can look at aquestion that has challenged Kabbalists for centuries: Why do so many bad peopleenjoy good lives and good people encounter so much suffering?Kabbalistic tradition is firmly planted in Judaism, which has a core belief inreward and punishment. For a few thousand years, the suggested attitude tocultivate by the great Jewish and Kabbalistic sages is this: When you see peoplewho do evil and yet seem to be enjoying this world, you should understand thatthe joy they are given in this world is actually the reward that they surelydeserve for some good that they’ve done, and that the punishment they deservewill be received by them in “the world to come.”When you see people who are good people but who suffer, you should understandthat the suffering the experience in this world is actually the punishment thatthey surely deserve for some bad that they’ve done, and that the reward theydeserve for being generally good people will be received in “the world to come.”“The world to come” is not the same as a next incarnation. The world to come isthe final destination of the soul. The good and bad you do is part of your“account,” and you cannot judge a situation by the limited period of onelifetime.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Divine punishment is not merely punitive. In fact, divine punishment, and allsuffering for that matter, is never simply for the sake of causing pain. Divinepunishment for bad deeds offers opportunities to refine your character traits,to prompt the introspection that is necessary to cause change in your behaviorand your soul.MISINTERPRETING BASIC KABBALISTIC IDEASSome of the topics discussed by Kabbalists, such as why people experiencesuffering, aren’t easy to explore and are often misunderstood. One of the risksin publicly discussing sensitive material is that the outsider, or the personwho’s satisfied with a superficial understanding of a topic, can often bemisinformed and jump to conclusions that are far from accurate.For example, a basic Kabbalistic idea is that everything is for the best. Thisidea is misinterpreted, however, and people think that all one really needs todo is to turn on the evening news to think that such an idea is insane.Everything is for the best? What about starvation? Tsunami? War? Disease?Murder? How can one possible say that everything is for the best? Anotherexample is the idea that nothing happens without God allowing it to happen. Canany sane person actually believe this? What about torture? Rape? Starvation? Arethese things that God allows to happen? And what of the people who believe theseideas to be true? Are they so callous, so glib, so insensitive?To prevent the inevitable slander and criticism that such ideas can inspire,Kabbalists are often forced to study in private. Uninformed outsiders don’trealize that Kabbalah isn’t callous. On the contrary, a Kabbalist is dedicatedto performing good deeds, acts of loving kindness, charity, and compassion.Kabbalists believe in medical research, in repairing the world, and in treatingeveryone as though they’re in the image of God.And yet, if you were to listen in on a Kabbalistic discussion of theology,specifically in relation to human suffering, you might easily conclude thatKabbalah is cruel and inhuman. I therefore beg you to consider these ideas withseriousness and sensitivity. Explore these ideas in depth, and consult wiseteachers to help you to grasp these ideas.On my bulletin board at home, I have a quote that I took from a book on physicsmany years ago. It reads, “In physics, you never understand a new idea, you justget used to it.” Perhaps the same goes for Kabbalah: These sublime ideas aremore than one can grasp in a lifetime, but as one works with them and seeks toprobe them in-depth, one often emerges with rich insight and life-changingperspectives.THIS IS A TEST; THIS IS ONLY A TESTWhile some of the suffering we face is the inevitable result of the misdeeds wedo, Kabbalists believe that sometimes God deliberately gives us tests toovercome. In a sense, it’s all about “no pain, no gain.” A good analogy would bethe process of building up one’s muscles in the gym. When you work out withweights, for example, what is actually happening is that the muscle tissue isbreaking down as a result of the workout. After the workout, the muscle tissuerebuilds and even comes back stronger than before the lifting of the weights —the test — has occurred.Kabbalists cultivate this attitude when confronted by a trial of life. Ratherthan be angry with God, rather than saying “why me?,” the faithful Kabbalisttries to understand that God provides medicine, sometimes bitter medicine, forthe purpose of healing, growth, and refinement. The soul has a long journey, farlonger than the short span of a lifetime. When God sees that a person needs tobuild up some muscle, a trial of some sort is offered which, if related toproperly, results in something more glorious than what existed before the trial.In Kabbalah, an important aspect of suffering is that some of the best things inlife happen as a result of a bad experience or terrible occurrence. Kabbalistsoften look back and see that had something terrible not happened, something elsethat’s glorious wouldn’t have happened, either. This way of looking at sufferingdoesn’t justify the terrible event, but it reminds one that life is on a fargrander scale than the limited and immediate level that’s so often the focus ofattention. Kabbalah urges people to expand their perspectives in order to betterhandle pain.TAKING SOLACE FROM TRIALS IN LIFEKabbalists teach that encountering a trial or experiencing suffering prompts anopportunity to examine one’s deeds closely to try to unravel the mystery of thesuffering. The introspective sufferer can come to understand the negative angelsthat he or she has created and thereby has the opportunity to makerectification.CAN GOD REALLY ALLOW SUFFERING?You don’t have to look very hard to see that many good people suffer. Somemodern theologians have a lot of trouble, theologically, with the view that Godis behind it all, either causing or allowing it to happen. One popular approachto the question, and one that goes against the views of every great Kabbalistand traditional Jewish thinker who has ever written on the subject, is to saythat God is not all powerful.Some of these modern theologians suggest that God might be “all-knowing” butthat God is not “all-powerful.” Another way they say it is that God created theworld and left it alone. This is absolutely contrary to the fundamentalconception of God in Kabbalistic tradition. God is all-powerful, God did notleave the world alone after creation, and everything, according to Kabbalah,comes from God.One of the primary distinctions between Kabbalah and many modern theologiansconcerns the view of creation. Those theologians (and the many individuals whoare not theologians but simply grapple with these questions) conceive of God ashaving created the universe a long time ago, whereas Kabbalah stands firm in thebelief that God is intimately involved with every detail of creation and in factcreates the world anew every moment.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]It’s forbidden to speak theology to a suffering person. Even though theKabbalist believes that suffering is an opportunity for introspection, she alsoknows that, in a time of suffering, it’s profoundly difficult for a mourner tohear such reasoning. In addition, although Kabbalists believe in karma and causeand effect in the universe, no mortal fully understands this cause and effectand therefore has no right to say that a certain person is suffering because ofhis or her misdeeds. That person may be suffering because of bad angels createdin the past, or the trial may be a gift sent by God to ultimately lift theperson up to spiritual heights that never could have been reached without thesuffering.Kabbalists throughout the ages have referred to this concept of introspectivesuffering as “the sin of the friends of Job.” Job, the Biblical character whoexperiences profound suffering, is visited by his friends who, when he complainsof his plight, say “Don’t you have faith in God? Surely you must have donesomething wrong because God doesn’t punish righteous people; God does notpervert justice. Doesn’t your faith in God bring you comfort?” Even though aperson can find comfort in his or her faith, pushing that point simply isn’tappropriate. If I’m suffering, I can use that suffering any way I wish, but if Isee you suffering, my job is not to speak theology but rather to try to help yourelieve your suffering.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my Kabbalah teachers taught me that the one exception to the prohibitionagainst speaking theology to a person who’s suffering is when that person is afriend. But my teacher explained that friend in this case doesn’t mean a casualacquaintance or even one of many good friends. In life, it’s highly recommendedthat each person have at least one extra special friendship that’s so intimate,so trusting, and so close that it’s permissible to speaking theology duringtroubled times. While a sufferer generally hopes to be surrounded by people whocan offer comfort, the sufferer who’s blessed by such a close friend can givethat person permission to speak theology at any time. That friend is the personin the sufferer’s life who can serve to remind him or her of the grand scheme ofthings and therefore can share the wisdom of Kabbalah.Kabbalistic tradition also teaches — and this is profoundly important — thatwhen souls finally achieve their goals and no longer need to be reincarnated,they bask in the Light of God and know that the pleasure of being in God’spresence is so sublime and so unlike any worldly pleasure that all the humansuffering endured was worthwhile.HANDLING THE PAINIn Kabbalistic terms, the angel Raphael brings divine healing powers from Above.Explained in Kabbalistic terms or in scientific terms, it’s all the same:There’s a miracle of healing in the world, and people can see it on their bodiesthroughout their lives.DESPAIR, THE WORST SIN: THE ADVICE OF RABBI NACHMAN OF BRATSLAVOne of the great Kabbalists in history is Rabbi Nachman, a great-grandson ofRabbi Israel, the Baal Shem Tov — Master of the Good Name — who was the founderof the Chassidic movement. Rabbi Nachman was a great Hasidic and Kabbalisticmaster in his own right, and even though he died in 1810, he has the uniquedistinction of having a large and growing number of followers in the worldtoday. Known as Breslover Hasidim, these students of Kabbalah are grateful forthe many teachings of Rabbi Nachman that were written down and are available inmany languages today.Rabbi Nachman described what he considered to be the worst sin: depression. Ofcourse, he wasn’t speaking of clinical depression, which is a medical conditionwhich requires professional attention. Rather, he referred to an attitude ofdepression more in line with despair, in which a person feels that he or she isso far down that there’s no hope. Remember that Kabbalah teaches that everydescent is for the sake of ascension (or as one of my teachers said, “inKabbalah there’s no such thing as down”). Rabbi Nachman taught that no oneshould ever despair because every fall occurs for the sake of the next ascent.To Rabbi Nachman’s message, one of my teachers adds that the distance between aperson and God is always the same. What is different is the spiritualorientation. The person who is farther away from God merely needs to turn aroundand approach the Almighty. A contemporary musician, Rabbi Jack Gabriel, wroteand performs a beautiful song called “Up with Joy.” This song is a musicalversion of Rabbi Nachman’s philosophy. Rabbi Gabriel sings, “Fake it ’til youmake it: up with joy.” Ultimately, the song, like Rabbi Nachman, urges people totake control of their emotions and put joy into their lives.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]A teacher of mine once told me that he actually enjoyed getting a minor cut orscratch on his hands because it was always a miracle to watch his body heal. Asa Kabbalist, this observation trained him to see that there are miracles allaround. When skeptics asked him, “Why are there no longer any miracles?,” hewould say, “There are miracles everywhere.” He’d point to a spot on one of hisfingers or hands and explain, “Just the other day, I had a little paper cut inthat place, and now there’s absolutely no evidence of it. It healed completely.”Of course, physical healing doesn’t always occur in your lifetime. Remember thatKabbalists believe that each person is a soul that has a body, and just as abird’s egg cracks and drops away to give birth to a new fledging, so too doesthe body of the human being drop away and give birth to the next stage on thatsoul’s journey.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]When it comes to someone else’s pain, a Kabbalist’s duty is to try and relievethat pain and help that person heal. But when it comes to one’s own pain, onecan construct an entirely different relationship with it. Kabbalistic traditionteaches that some pain is like a fire of purification. In order to understandthis concept of pain as purification, you need to keep in mind that Kabbalistictradition recognizes that human experience transcends this world. Your soulexisted before this current incarnation and will exist after the currentincarnation (see Chapter 7 for the scoop on reincarnation)."},{"pageContent":"PART IIILIVIN’ LA VIDA KABBALAH[Images/915904 fgCN03.jpg]In this part . . .Kabbalah isn’t just theoretical. On the contrary, Kabbalah is in the doing. AndKabbalah urges its practitioners to do lots of things — every day, every week,throughout the year, and throughout one’s lifetime. But there are also lots ofthings that Kabbalists aren’t supposed to do. Ultimately, Kabbalah is a dance ofcosmic proportions. So, put on your dancing shoes; it’s time to do someKabbalah."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9LIVING ONE DAY AT A TIMEIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Fulfilling the three daily tasksbullet [Images/arrow.png] Walking through the day the Kabbalistic wayBeing a Kabbalist is no part-time job. For Kabbalists, every thought, gesture,inclination, and action has significance. In fact, every moment of every daypresents spiritual opportunities, from the moment you wake up until you’re soundasleep and dreaming. Also, there are things Kabbalists do every day andKabbalistic ways to do everything.In this chapter, I explain the three activities that are part of the Kabbalist’sdaily routine, and I show you how Kabbalists make all the activities in the dayspecial.THREE DAILY TASKS OF THE KABBALISTA few thousand years ago, a righteous man named Shimon taught a remarkable ideathat Kabbalists think about every day. What’s the big idea? That the worlddepends on three things:bullet [Images/check.png] The study of the holy teachingsbullet [Images/check.png] Prayerbullet [Images/check.png] Acts of lovingkindnessThe prayer book most Kabbalists have used daily for centuries quotes thisteaching, and Kabbalists strive to include these three activities into theirdaily routines.PRAYER: YOU CAN (AND SHOULD) PRAY JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE AND ANYTIMEGoing to a synagogue (or anywhere else, for that matter) to pray isn’tnecessary. For the Kabbalist, God is conceived of as Infinite, which means thatthere’s no place where God is absent (for more on this topic, see Chapter 16).In fact, two of the most well-known Kabbalists in history, Rabbi Israel BaalShem Tov and Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, are both famous for their sharedpreference to pray alone in the forest.Praying is a serious activity, and you can find plenty of recommended prayersand instruction on how to pray (see Chapter 15). But the place to start is . . .wherever you are. Keep the following in mind:bullet [Images/check.png] You don’t need to get all dressed up to pray.bullet [Images/check.png] You don’t need to wait for the Sabbath or a holy dayto pray.bullet [Images/check.png] You don’t need to find the right prayer book to pray.bullet [Images/check.png] You don’t need to face any special direction to pray.bullet [Images/check.png] You don’t need a rabbi to pray.bullet [Images/check.png] You don’t need to pray in any particular language.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my teachers wonders whether people often build big synagogues andchurches because they hope to keep God inside them. But God hears peopleeverywhere, just as God cares about human behavior everywhere — in themarketplace, in the kitchen, and even in the bedroom.Kabbalists have a special relationship to prayer: Because the soul is a divinespark within people (see Chapter 6), and because prayer is the process ofconnecting with the Divine, in a way, the soul is always connected to God. It’sas though the soul is always praying. The point of prayer is connection to God.Prayer helps people remember that they aren’t the center of existence, butrather God is the center.CREATING INDIVIDUALIZED PRAYERSAt any time and for any reason, a person canbullet [Images/check.png] Praise God: “O God, what delicious ingredients are inthis hot fudge sundae!”bullet [Images/check.png] Express gratitude to God: “Thank you, God, for thisdelicious hot fudge sundae!”bullet [Images/check.png] Make requests of God: “What I would like right now,God, is a hot fudge sundae!”People who pray regularly usually discover that they have favorite prayers andget into the habit of reciting them regularly. Even though throughout historymost serious Kabbalists have prayed three times a day using a fixed formula (seeChapter 15), Kabbalists are encouraged to speak to God from their hearts at alltimes. Eventually, Kabbalists report reaching a point at which they feel as ifthey’re speaking to God nonstop, all day long.SAYING A BLESSING UPON LEAVING THE BATHROOMKabbalah has blessings for everything: eating, studying, putting on newclothing, seeing a shooting star, and countless other activities. Generally, aperson says a blessing before doing something, such as eating a piece of fruit(an activity that has its own special blessing). God is in the bathroom, too,but out of respect, Kabbalists wait to recite this blessing until they’releaving the bathroom:Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who has formed humans inwisdom, and created in them a system of ducts and tubes. It is well known beforeYour glorious throne that if but one of these be opened, or if one of those beclosed, it would be impossible to exist in Your presence. Blessed art You, OLord, who heals all creatures and does wonders.GETTING HELP AND GUIDANCE FROM A PRAYER BOOKEven though Kabbalists can pray in their own languages and can pray to God bytalking off the tops of their heads at any time and in any place, they may alsotake a little help from prayer books. A prayer book is an anthology of prayers,and over the centuries, prayer books have gotten bigger and bigger because everygeneration adds to them. The point of using a prayer book is not to read everyword but rather to dip into it to find words of inspiration. After all, a goodprayer helps people to express themselves, and a prayer that’s just right forone person may not be right for the next.A friend once told me that, when he was a little boy, he sat next to hisgrandfather in the synagogue and listened as his grandfather mumbled the Hebrewwords from the prayer book. When my friend asked his grandfather, “Do youunderstand what you are saying?,” his grandfather pointed upward to heaven andsaid, “No, but God does.”Even though God understands people and knows what’s in their hearts, it’s alsoimportant for people to understand what they’re saying when they pray. Prayingisn’t about spouting incomprehensible words in a foreign language. So, althoughlearning Hebrew (the language that Kabbalists have prayed in for centuries)certainly is meaningful, one can find authentic Kabbalistic prayer booksavailable in bilingual editions.Over the centuries prayer books have appeared in Yiddish, Spanish, French,Russian, and many other languages. But Kabbalists have a special relationship tothe Hebrew language, known in Hebrew as lashon hakodesh (lah-shone hah-koe-desh; the holy language). The Torah was originally recorded in Hebrew, andKabbalists believe that God creates the world through a combination of Hebrewletters.Hebrew words are rich with meaning that simply can’t be conveyed with atranslation. So although prayer is important in any language and should bespoken in words that the speaker can understand, Kabbalists feel that Hebrew isthe ultimate language for prayer. In fact, some even feel that Hebrew shouldonly be used for prayer and Torah study. Many traditional Jews in Israel resistspeaking Hebrew in everyday conversation, feeling that the holy tongue should bereserved for the sacred tasks of study and prayer.Kabbalists also often pray by using the biblical book of Psalms. In Hebrew it’scalled Tehillim (teh-hee- leem ). It consists of 150 psalms, most of themwritten by King David (who’s known in Hebrew as Dovid ha-Melekh [doe -vidhah-mel -ekh]). If you read through the psalms, you’ll see that they expressjust about every human emotion. For centuries, Kabbalists have used thismagnificent book of spiritual poetry to express their deepest yearnings.STUDY: KABBALISTS DO IT EVERY DAY, EVEN IF JUST FOR FIVE MINUTESKabbalists don’t let a day go by without studying at least one spiritual text.To a Kabbalist, just as people breathe every day and eat everyday, they alsoneed to pray every day and study every day. Often, people who want to adopt thishabit get discouraged before they even start. After all, with such busy lives,who has time to study every day?The rule of thumb for study is the same as it is for going to the gym: Doing itfor only five minutes every day is better than doing it once a week for fivehours. By praying every day, God’s presence is felt as an integral part of one’slife; by studying every day, one’s life is sewn with the holy activity ofcontemplating the ideas that lead to knowing the unknowable God (see Chapter16).FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]Both prayer and study bring people closer to God. Whereas prayer is mainly anemotional activity, study is intellectual. Kabbalists connect with God in bothways. My teacher taught me that the way of holiness in Kabbalistic tradition isthe rhythmic oscillation between prayer and study.Study involves asking questions, questioning assumptions, probing forinconsistencies, and raising doubts. Prayer involves expressing faith, puttingtrust in God, and giving voice to emotions. To get stuck in either activity —prayer or study, faith or doubt — is a terrible error on the spiritual path.Prayer without study or study without prayer are both incomplete; the “back andforth” between prayer and study, between faith and doubt, is considered properand the way of holiness.CHOOSING TEXTS FOR STUDYKabbalistic literature is vast, and most Kabbalistic books require quite a bitof knowledge. So picking up most Kabbalistic texts and diving right in isn’tvery practical (see Chapter 14 for more on the study of Kabbalistic texts). Infact, one of the reasons a teacher is so important for the Kabbalist is torecommend the right book to study at the right time. Two books are particularlyuseful for the student who wants to get into a daily study routine:bullet [Images/check.png] The Biblebullet [Images/check.png] Pirke AvotBelieve it or not, the first book Kabbalists read and study on a regular basisis the Bible, also known as the Holy Scriptures. Most of the world knows it asthe Old Testament, but Kabbalists don’t use this term because “old” is areference to the word “new” in New Testament, a book that’s not generally on theKabbalist’s bookshelf. In Hebrew, the Holy Scriptures are referred to as Tanakh(tah-nakh ), which is an acronym of three words:bullet [Images/check.png] Torah (toe-rah): The Five Books of Moses, consistingof the biblical books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomybullet [Images/check.png] Nevi’im (neh-vee-eem): The books of the Prophets, likeIsaiah and Jeremiahbullet [Images/check.png] Ketuvim (keh-too-veem): The other books of the Bible,often called the Writings, including Proverbs, the Song of Songs, and the PsalmsFor the purpose of Kabbalistic study, the Bible can be read from beginning toend, but it also can be, and often is, read by jumping around from place toplace. A principle of Bible study among Kabbalists is Ein mukdam u’meucharb’Torah (ayn mook-dahm oo-mooh-khar bah-toe -rah; there is no before or after inthe Torah), which means that the Torah isn’t chronological even though the firstchapters begin with creation and even though there’s a certain chronology in theBible. So although you may want to systematically read the Bible from “beginningto end,” the book is really not set up that way, and jumping around is perfectlyacceptable (kind of like this book, although I’m certainly not equating KabbalahFor Dummies with the Bible!).Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]Kabbalists don’t read the Bible only on the literal level (see Chapter 14), soif you’re looking for an edition of the Holy Scriptures, try to find one with acommentary. Many commentaries on the Holy Scriptures are available in English. Awell-stocked Jewish bookstore with a helpful staff person can guide you to theones that may be best to begin with. There is no single “accepted” commentary.In fact, in principle, there are many levels of Torah explication. Sometraditional sources say there are 70 ways to study the Torah, while othersources say that there are 600,000 different levels of Torah study! Also, manycommentaries available in English focus on individual parts of the HolyScriptures. For the Five Books of Moses, I highly recommend The Living Torah byRabbi Aryeh Kaplan (Moznaim). A wonderful new multivolume set of commentariesthat incorporate many Kabbalistic ideas and teachings is The Chumash — TheGutnick Edition. Several volumes have appeared and more are planned.The other ideal book for daily study, Perke Avos (peer -kay ah -vohs), whichmeans “the chapter of the sages,” is available in English in many differenteditions. It consists of brief yet profound sayings that have been contemplatedby Kabbalists for at least two millennia.FINDING THE RIGHT STUDY PARTNERKabbalists have a special term for one’s study partner: khevrusah (khehv-roo-sah). Although it comes from khaver (khah-vair; friend), the study partner is aspecial friend, a friend who occupies a unique roll in the life of a Kabbalist.Finding a study partner isn’t always easy. It’s important to find someone who’swilling to make a firm commitment to meet regularly and on schedule. Many studypartnerships have fallen apart because one member doesn’t make it a priority.Often, the two members of a study partnership are on different levels. One mayknow Hebrew while the other doesn’t. One may be more familiar with the text thanthe other is. Don’t assume that when one person “knows” more than the other thathe or she becomes the teacher. It’s often the case that a newcomer to a textwill raise questions and offer points of view that the more experienced partnerhas overlooked. In fact, one of the primary reasons to study with a partner isthat when you study alone, you can easily fool yourself into thinking that youunderstand a passage well. The Talmud teaches that when two people studytogether they “sharpen each other’s blades.”A teacher can often recommend a study partner, but finding just the right studypartner, like finding the right spouse, is often a matter of luck. You neverknow what the actual dynamics will be. One person I know finally had to drop outof his study partnership because the partner was always harping on the sameissue. It wasn’t that the issue was unimportant, but the person whose issue itwas just made too big a deal out of it constantly.I know people who have standing telephone appointments with their study partnersevery day. Again, even if the studying lasts for just a few minutes a day, itall adds up.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]I once asked my teacher why so few people speak about God, even among believers.He told me that it’s because speaking publicly about one’s most intimate andimportant relationship is often difficult. That’s where the study partner comesin. A student must be open to expressing his or her doubts, faith, and mostpressing questions to a study partner.SHOPPING FOR CONTEMPORARY KABBALISTIC BOOKSIn recent years, some bookstores have devoted sections of their shops to bookson Kabbalah. Just because a book is in that section doesn’t mean it’s reliable,of course. Just because a writer finds a publisher doesn’t mean that the book isaccurate, insightful, or even worth the paper it’s printed on. In this regard,books on Kabbalah are no different from books on any other subject. When you’rein the market for contemporary Kabbalistic books, consider the following pointsof advice:bullet [Images/check.png] Books on Kabbalah by traditional Jewish publishers aregenerally reliable because Orthodox Jewish publishers pay particularly closeattention to accuracy and authenticity. I don’t mean to suggest that Jewishpublishers who aren’t Orthodox are suspect, but I’m simply saying that Orthodoxpublishers are known to be extremely careful about who and what they publish,and they make special efforts to be certain that their authors are qualified andhave sterling reputations. In fact, one rarely sees a book published by anOrthodox Jewish publisher without at least two pages of haskamot (hah-skah-mote;approbations), which are testimonies by authorities in the field who state thatthe manuscript was examined with great care.bullet [Images/check.png] Your best bet is to buy a book on Kabbalah based onthe author’s reputation, but you have to know what you’re looking for. If youwant an academic history of Kabbalah, then obviously you should research thereputation of the author to make sure that this academic has a good reputationamong his or her peers. If you want a book about Kabbalistic ideas, readabilityisn’t enough; nor is selecting a book based on its popularity. A book can be abestseller and be all wet.bullet [Images/check.png] If you see a book on Kabbalah spelled with a “C” (asin “Cabala”) rather than a “K,” be suspicious. The accepted transliteration ofthe word among knowledgeable people is “Kabbalah.”bullet [Images/check.png] Rely on the guidance of a teacher. As I stressthroughout this book, a student of Kabbalah must have a qualified teacher whocan offer this sort of guidance.bullet [Images/check.png] Kabbalah has become a pop subject and one that manypublishers who want to jump on the Kabbalah bandwagon try to cash in on. Thereare even a number of books with the word “Kabbalah” in the title that haveabsolutely nothing to do with the subject of Kabbalah! It’s important to readreviews and do a little research on the reviewer or the publication in which thereviews appear. The old saying, “May the buyer beware” is an important one whenit comes to books of or about Kabbalah.ACTS OF LOVINGKINDNESS: IN PRINCIPLE, KABBALISTS DO AS MANY AS POSSIBLEThe Kabbalistic term for acts of lovingkindness is gemelut chasadim(geh-meh-loot khah-sah-deem ). This term is meant in both a general way as wellas in many specific ways. Generally, a person’s approach toward people should befilled with kindness. A Kabbalist is always on the lookout for opportunities tooffer kindness to others. For the Kabbalist, kindness is the basis of his or herdaily lifestyle.More specifically, there are many acts of lovingkindness that are well-known andcommonly discussed within Kabbalistic texts. A few of the most highly valuedacts of lovingkindness in Kabbalistic tradition are:bullet [Images/check.png] Bikkur holim (beer-koor khoh-leem; visiting the sick)bullet [Images/check.png] Nichum Avelim (nee-khum ah-vay-leem; comfortingmourners)bullet [Images/check.png] Hakhnasat Orchim (hakh-nahs-aht oar-kheem;hospitality)bullet [Images/check.png] Hesed shel emet (kheh-sed shell eh-met; true kindness)bullet [Images/check.png] Kevud av v’em (keh-vood ahv v’eem; honoring one’sfather and mother)One of life’s goals for Kabbalists — perhaps life’s main goal — is to become aninstrument of God’s will. Achieving this goal is somewhat of a paradox forKabbalists, however, The Bible says that man is made “in God’s image,” andKabbalists take this to mean that humans have free will. Kabbalists believe thatthe divine spark within people gives them the ability to choose freely. On theother hand, the goal of Kabbalists is to give up their will in order to do God’swill.How does the Kabbalist find out what God’s will is? Through study and prayer, ofcourse. Kabbalists study the wisdom of great sages of the past and the presentin order to learn how to behave. And the Kabbalist prays to receive divineguidance when making choices. When a Kabbalist learns how to live, his or herwill and God’s will merge into one.When a Kabbalist learns from the sages the righteous way to act, he abandons hiswill for God’s will. So when a Kabbalist walks down the street and sees a personin need, for example, the Kabbalist reaches out his hand to give charity, whichis an example of an act of lovingkindness. That simple act has a larger meaning,however: The Kabbalist knows that with the right inner intention (see thesection “Intending to be intentional” later in the chapter) and the rightunderstanding, his outstretched hand actually becomes the outstretched hand ofGod.Kabbalists give charitable donations with great frequency. Some put coins into acharity box before each prayer session, and others make sure to give somethingto everyone who asks, whether it be a request for a donation through the mail oran approaching beggar in the street. Ancient tradition teaches that everyone hasan obligation to give charity. In Hebrew, the word for “charity,” tzedakah(tseh-dah -kah), really means “justice.” For the Kabbalist, giving charity isactually an expression of justice.For centuries, the great sages have discussed just about every questionimaginable related to giving charity: How much money to give (at least 10percent of one’s income), how much is too much (more than 20 percent of one’sincome puts the giver at financial risk), how to give (quietly), how not to give(never in a way that causes a person public embarrassment), and many others. Asimpler instruction comes from the great Jewish sage, Maimonides, who taughtthat one should develop the practice of giving a small coin to every beggar whomakes a request.For Kabbalists, God is in the details. Jewish tradition and Kabbalistictradition examine every aspect of every subject in order to thoroughlyunderstand the recommended behavior. With this in mind, it’s not sufficientsimply to believe in giving charity. One must understand all the possibleramifications and questions prompted by the act of giving charity.Giving charity is required of every Kabbalist. The basis for it is found in theTorah (the Five Books of Moses, also known as the first five books of theBible), which says that a person is required to give a tenth of his or herincome to the poor. The Torah has other laws about giving charity as well; forexample, the produce at the corners of a farmer’s fields is supposed to be leftfor the poor.Kabbalists give charity many times over the course of the day, including:bullet [Images/check.png] Before each of the three prayer sessions (morning,afternoon, and evening)bullet [Images/check.png] Before sitting down to studybullet [Images/check.png] When passing a poor person on the street who asks fora coinbullet [Images/check.png] Any other time that he or she is so inspiredRemember [Images/Remember.jpg]Even if a Kabbalist thinks that a person on the street is faking need, he or shegives charity. As the sages of old taught, people should be thankful even to thefake beggars because they keep others in the habit of giving.FIGURING OUT HOW TO LOVEKabbalists don’t assume that lovingkindness is easy to perform. They know thatit’s all too easy to say, “Everyone must love each other.” The real questionsare: How do people love each other? What is love anyway?Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]A fundamental principle in Kabbalah is the idea that no human emotion is bad orgood in and of itself. Hate isn’t considered bad, and love isn’t consideredgood. Kabbalists believe that all the emotions and potentialities of the humanheart are only deemed good or bad based on how they’re used. It’s all aboutdosage and timing. As pharmacists know, a fine line separates a medicine and apoison. So, there are times when hate is called for. For example, Kabbalists aretaught to “hate evil.” Not just to fight it but to hate it. Jewish traditiondoesn’t advocate turning the other cheek. Sometimes, as one of my teachers toldme, you have to hit back; sometimes, you even have to hit below the belt.I once asked the Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel what he learned from theHolocaust. He told me that he learned to fight evil and not to wait, not tothink that “it will get better.”Sometimes love is the absolutely wrong emotion. For example, I know aphotographer who created a photographic study of a battered women’s shelter andits residents. She told me that, quite often, the battered women go back to themen who beat them up. When asked why, they often say, “Because I love him.”Sometimes love is the wrong emotion.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]I once asked one of my Kabbalah teachers the following question: If it’s truethat all possible emotions and feelings are only good or bad according to howthey’re used and that no feeling is, in and of itself, bad, then how is theheretical view denying God’s existence ever good? He told me to imagine walkingdown the street and seeing a beggar asking for money. I’d think to myself, asKabbalists often do, that God takes care of everyone, so therefore I don’t haveto give any charity to the person. My teacher suggested that in such a case I’dhave to drum up “a little heresy” by thinking that God may not take care ofeveryone. In that way, I would be prompted to give charity. In a way, my heresywould inspire me to give. Sometimes even heresy has its value.GETTING IN SHAPE TO PERFORM ACTS OF KINDNESSKabbalah differs from many other forms of mysticism in that it’s deeplyconnected to law. Kabbalists throughout history have been just as bound toJewish law as they have been to the sublime ideas of mysticism. The study of thelaw and the discussions that result from the law guide Kabbalists in theirbehavior. Simply believing that acts of lovingkindness are important to performisn’t enough; the Kabbalist studies the holy texts in order to fully understandjust what makes for a true act of kindness.Kabbalists find the curriculum of life in the holy books, beginning with theTorah and including all other great works of spiritual literature of the Jewishpeople, including the Talmud, the Midrash, the Zohar, the Codes of Law, and thegreat commentaries up to the present (see Chapter 13). There is no way aroundit; to be a Kabbalist means to be a student, and to be a student means to studythe sacred texts in order to learn how to live.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]But to be a Kabbalist doesn’t mean that you find a book that tells you what todo and then you go and do it. Studying is like lifting weights at a gym. I go tothe gym in the morning and work out with dumbbells. I’m quite good with them,but I don’t go to the gym to learn how to lift dumbbells; I go there to get inshape. I just use the dumbbells to help me get into shape so that I have thestrength and stamina to get through each day. The Kabbalist doesn’t go to thebooks to find out exactly what to do. Rather, the Kabbalist studies to get “inshape,” so that when a situation presents itself, the Kabbalist can apply allthe wisdom he or she has learned to the situation at hand.SMILING IS VERY IMPORTANTEvery serious Kabbalist throughout history has studied the wisdom of a greatsage named Shammai (shah-my). Shammai was known to be a rather strict person andwas sometimes impatient. Nevertheless, he taught a lesson that’s recorded as alaw that all Kabbalists must follow. Shammai said, “Make your study regular; saylittle and do much; and greet every person with a smile.” To Kabbalists, smilingwhen you greet someone is the law!FEELING GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF AND ACCEPTING PRAISE FOR ACTS OF KINDNESSFromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]For Kabbalists, there’s always room for growth and improvement. As one of myteachers emphasizes, “If you think you’ve arrived, you’re lost.” The life of theKabbalist is the life of someone who is constantly trying to improve himself,refine himself, and uplift himself. There’s no room for smugness in the soul ofthe Kabbalist. On the other hand, Kabbalists know that when they perform acts ofkindness, they can feel good about themselves because they’re doing God’s will.An ancient saying reveals this balance between continuing improvement and praisefor one’s accomplishments. A few thousand years ago, a great sage taught, “Hewho flees from honor, honor will pursue him.” People often think this teachingmeans that the way to obtain honor is to run away from it. But the ancientteaching has a different meaning that’s based on the Hebrew word rodef (roe-def; pursue). A rodef is a pursuer and may even be a person who wants to murdersomeone. This particular teaching means that, for the person who deserves honorand runs away from it, honor will become a pursuer and will track down thedeserving person until he or she accepts the honor that’s deserved. Essentially,false modesty has no place. If you do something that’s not right, you deservecriticism; if you do something right (such as performing an act of kindness),you deserve (and should accept) praise.WAKING UPKabbalah isn’t a hobby or a part-time activity. To be a Kabbalist is to be alertto the principles of Kabbalah at every moment. A Hebrew phrase mounted on thewall of many synagogues says it best: Dah lifnay me attah omed (dah lif-nay meeah-tah oh-maid; Know before whom you stand). From the moment a Kabbalist wakesup, he or she knows that God sees everything and cares about everything.INTENDING TO BE INTENTIONALKavanah (kah-vah-nah; inner intention) is the basis of all actions made by aKabbalist. Basically, to have kavanah is to be conscious and deliberate. AKabbalist must be alert, awake, aware, and intentional in his or her actions sothat he or she doesn’t just go through the motions. Instead, every action needsto be accompanied by the proper inner intent.Even though kavanah is a full-time job, it’s especially important first thing inthe morning. Starting one’s day with the right inner attitude is the launchingpad for the entire day the lies ahead. Kabbalistic tradition urges everyone tobegin the day with an awareness of and gratitude to God.Kabbalists believe that one’s actions and one’s intentions must be in sync. Touse an extreme example, you can’t say “I love you” to someone while feelinghostility. It’s dishonest, of course, but it’s also simply the wrong intention.In general, Kabbalists want to make sure that their thoughts, words, and deedsare in concert with each other. While one can do the right thing for the wrongreason, it is best to strive for each act to be pure and complete.CULTIVATING GRATITUDE AT THE FIRST MOMENT OF CONSCIOUSNESSWhen a Kabbalist wakes up in the morning, one thought should be on his or hermind and lips. No, I don’t mean “What’s for breakfast?,” “I better rush; I havean appointment,” or “I’m going to make a lot of money today.” I’m talking aboutthe Modeh Ani:I gratefully thank you, living and eternal Ruler, for You have returned my soulwithin me with compassion — abundant is your faithfulness.In Hebrew, “Modeh Ani” means “I am grateful.” The whole sentence is fairly easyto memorize in Hebrew. Here’s the pronunciation:Moe-deh ah-nee leh-foh-neh-kha meh-lekh khai v’kah-yohm sheh-heh-kheh-zar-tahbee nish-ma-tee b’khem-lah rah-bah eh-moo-nah-teh-kha.The Kabbalist doesn’t just say these words habitually without thinking of theirmeaning. They’re said, like everything else, with kavanah (see the precedingsection). By saying the Modeh Ani, the Kabbalist isbullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for restoring his or her faculties aftera night’s sleepbullet [Images/check.png] Acknowledging that God gave a new day in order for oneto become more aware of Godbullet [Images/check.png] Acknowledging that God is faithful to those who feeland express gratitude to GodRemember [Images/Remember.jpg]Anything but entitled, a Kabbalist is in the habit of expressing gratitude allday long. The great sages urge everyone to recite 100 blessings a day (seeChapter 15). Those blessings are basically words of thanks. The good and thebad, pleasures and pains, happy times and sad times are all from God and are allfor the best (see Chapter 5). The great sage Reb Zusia (reb zoo -shah) oncesaid, “When I was hungry, I thanked God for giving me an appetite.”GETTING WASHED AND DRESSEDA Kabbalist’s day must be filled with an awareness of God and God’s presence.Even someone busy with a task as seemingly mundane as getting washed and dressedmust be filled with the awareness of God. Kabbalists believe that the onlyReality is God — there’s nothing and no place without God. (One of the namesKabbalists have for God is HaMakom [hah-mah-cohm; the place].)THE BODY IS HOLYKabbalists don’t believe that the body is obscene or dirty in any way. IggeretHa Kodesh (ee-geh-ret hah-koe-desh; The Holy Letter), a well-known Kabbalisticbook written by Rabbi Moses the son of Nachman (also known as Nachmanides),states that every detail of the human body is holy and saying that any part ofthe body or any normal human bodily function is unholy is an affront againstGod.WASHING YOUR HANDS WHEN YOU AWAKEA custom that has existed for a few thousand years and is practiced daily byKabbalists is washing one’s hands immediately upon arising in the morning. Infact, some say that you shouldn’t even walk four cubits (an ancient measurementthat’s approximately the length from the tip of one’s middle finger to one’selbow) after getting out of bed without washing your hands. Some people even seta large cup of water and a basin next to the bed at night in preparation forwashing their hands in the morning.Many explanations have been provided over the centuries for this custom, but allbasically point to the same idea: The body is the vessel of the soul, and thesoul is holy. One must treat the vessel in a special way because its function isto house the holy soul, and that’s a lofty purpose.The proper way to wash one’s hands in the morning is to pour water over theright hand and then the left three times while saying this blessing:Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the Universe, Who has sanctified us withHis commandments and has commanded us regarding washing the hands.PUTTING ON YOUR SHOES WITH PURPOSEKabbalah teaches that there’s great significance to the right side and the leftsides of things (see Chapter 4). According to Kabbalah, the sides are connectedto two major cosmic forces in the universe.bullet [Images/check.png] Chesed (keh-sed): Signifies expansion and is relatedto the right sidebullet [Images/check.png] Gevurah (geh-voo-rah): Signifies contraction and isrelated to the left sideChesed and Gevurah are always working in combination with each other. Forexample, as a parent, I must offer a certain amount of Chesed to my children;specifically, I must encourage them to expand in the world and become who theyare to become. I must also impose a certain amount of Gevurah, or limitation anddiscipline, on my children. Presenting too much of either is a terrible mistakefor a parent to make, but the proper combination of the two is the path ofhealthy parenting. (I discuss Chesed and Gevurah in further detail in Chapter4.)Kabbalists are always aware of the significance of these two cosmic forces, andputting on one’s shoes — the right and the left — is a perfect opportunity toremind oneself of these two forces and the need to combine them properly.Kabbalists disagree on the proper procedure for putting on shoes. Some say youshould begin with the right shoe, whereas others say you should begin with theleft. Still others offer a compromise: Put on the right shoe first but don’t tieit, and then put on the left shoe. After both shoes are on, the order isreversed for tying, with the left shoe tied first followed by the right shoe. Inevery method, the value of the cosmic forces of right and left, Chesed andGevurah, are evident.DRESSING WITH MODESTYThe Hebrew concept of tzniut (tznee-oot; modesty) is important in Kabbalistictradition. Some Kabbalists apply the general concern for modesty to modesty inhow a person dresses and have many specific rules about it (such as how longsleeves and hemlines should be among women), but others are willing to take amore relaxed approach and suggest that local and contemporary standards shouldapply. After all, a woman or a man can wear the most modest clothing and stillbehave inappropriately, just as people can dress in more relaxed and modernattire and yet act with exemplary behavior.It’s generally recommended that the Kabbalist dress neatly and modestly whenpraying in the synagogue. On the Sabbath, tradition urges Kabbalists to dress asthey would if they had an audience with the King. (For more on the Sabbath,check out Chapter 10.)OFFERING PRAYERS AND MEDITATIONThe Kabbalist must always be aware of God, which is why the morning activitieshave a special intensity. It’s so easy to jump out of bed and get wrapped up inall the activities and demands of one’s life. The Kabbalist also gets involvedin the tasks of the every day, but only after beginning each day with sufficientkavanah (inner intention) to make the day a holy one. Launching the day properlyinvolves attention to prayer and meditation.RECITING THE STANDARD MORNING BLESSINGSIncluded in the 100 blessings that Kabbalists are to recite each day (seeChapter 15) is a list of blessings traditionally recited in the morning, oneright after the other. These blessings appear in traditional prayer books andhave been recited by Kabbalists for centuries. They suggest that people expresstheir gratitude to the Creator for all the gifts and blessings that have beenbestowed upon them. Here’s a sampling of the blessings:Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who gave the heart theunderstanding to distinguish between day and night.Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who has not made me aheathen.Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who has not made me aslave.Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who opens the eyes of theblind.Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who clothes the naked.Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who sets the captivesfree.Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who straightens those whoare bowed down.Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who spread a forth theearth above the waters.Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who has provided for allmy needs.Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who guides the steps ofman.Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who girds Israel withmight.Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who crowns Israel withglory.Blessed art You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who gives strength to theweary.Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who removes sleep from myeyes and slumber from my eyelids.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]These blessings aren’t all meant literally. For example, God doesn’t literally“open the eyes of the blind.” The sense of this blessing is that all people areblind to some extent, and God helps people see life and understand what’s trulybig and truly small, what’s important and unimportant. One of my teachers taughtme that these traditional blessings can be interpreted by each individual in hisor her own way and can be applied to suit each person’s needs and desires.MORNING PRAYERSKabbalists can pray any time they like, but they also have three major prayersessions: morning, afternoon, and evening. The morning prayer session, known asShakharit (shah -khah-reet) comes from the Hebrew word Shakhar, which means“morning.” I discuss the afternoon and evening prayer sessions, which are quitesimilar to the morning prayers, in Chapter 15.After the recitation of the morning blessings that I mention in the precedingsection, one moves on to the part of the morning prayers known as Songs ofPraise. Kabbalists begin their days thinking about God, meditating on God, andsinging songs of praise to God. Some of those songs, as found in the prayerbook, include the well-known word Hallelujah (praise to God).I once led a Kabbalah prayer service for beginners and suggested that the tuneof the song “Michael Row Your Boat Ashore” be used as a Song of Praise. To thetune, I sang, “I am happy to be here today,” and everyone responded,“Hallelujah.” I asked the others to suggest additional phrases of praise andgratitude. Someone called out, “And I am grateful to be alive,” to which thegroup once again responded “Hallelujah.” We went on like that for a while, withpeople calling out their words of praise precisely in the spirit of thetraditional morning prayer session as Kabbalists have done for centuries.FOCUSING ON THE ONENESS OF THE UNIVERSE: A DAILY KABBALISTIC MEDITATIONThe most famous prayer in Jewish life — and one that has been recited byKabbalists for dozen of centuries — is called the Sh’ma (sheh-mah; hear). TheSh’ma is as follows: Sh’ma Yisrael, Adonai Elohaynu, Adonai Echad (sheh-mahyis-rah-ehl ah-doh-noy eh-loh-hay -noo ah-doh-noy eh -chahd; Hear O Israel, theLord our God, the Lord is One).Kabbalists recite this prayer twice a day — once in the morning and once in theevening. The prayer is rich with meaning, every word having layers ofsignificance. But the essence of the prayer is a meditation on the oneness ofthe universe: God is One, everything is God, everything is One.GRABBING A BITEKabbalists don’t simply eat. When a Kabbalist eats, something quite profoundhappens. You can’t see it, but it’s very much on the mind of the Kabbalist.According to Kabbalah, the act of eating is part of the repairing of the world(see Chapter 8). The basic idea is that when God created the world, he poureddivine light into a vessel. The vessel shattered, and the “stuff” of the worldbecame the shards of that broken vessel, so that contained within the shards aresparks of the divine light. By eating, Kabbalists aren’t just nourishingthemselves, they’re releasing the divine sparks that are embedded within thefood. Awareness of this release is the proper kavanah for the Kabbalist who’seating.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]One of the greatest Kabbalists of all times, Rabbi Israel (known as the BaalShem Tov), had this to say on the subject of eating: “Take care that all you dois for God’s sake. Regarding eating, do not say that the intention of eatingshall be that you gain strength. This is a good intention, of course; but thetrue perfection only exists where the deed itself happens to heaven, for that iswhere the holy sparks are raised.”Another thing on the minds of Kabbalists as they eat is that the food is givingthem the energy to do holy acts in the world, including repairing the world (seeChapter 8) and performing acts of lovingkindness. So, when a Kabbalist eats, heor she is aware that the food is contributing to the holiness of the world.BLESSINGS TO SAY BEFORE EATINGThe theme of gratitude permeates everything for the Kabbalist, and eating is noexception. A Kabbalist never eats without first expressing gratitude for what heor she is about to eat. Even if a Kabbalist eats only a tiny piece of chocolateor a spoonful of green peas or a sip of water, the blessing for that particularfood item must be said. The blessings are simply expressions of thanks andgratitude. These blessings are found in the standard prayer book.For blessing purposes, different foods fall under different categories, and eachcategory has a special blessing. The categories arebullet [Images/check.png] Breadbullet [Images/check.png] Winebullet [Images/check.png] Baked goods other than breadbullet [Images/check.png] Food found in trees (fruits and nuts)bullet [Images/check.png] Food from the ground (like cucumbers and strawberries)bullet [Images/check.png] Everything else (like fluids, meat, cheese, and so on)Some foods are trickier to categorize than others. For example, peanuts aren’treally nuts, they’re legumes. The appropriate blessing for a peanut isn’t theblessing said for nuts but rather the one said for plants that come from theground. The whole system of different blessings for different foods helps theKabbalist to be extra conscious of just what kind of food God is providing.Here’s a personal example of a food blessing in action. In my opinion, thegreatest commercially available cookie is the Mint Milano. I often eat themafter a long day (I suggest freezing them first), but I don’t go home, head tomy freezer, and pop down a few Mint Milanos. First, I hold the cookie in my handand recite the Kabbalist blessing for eating baked goods (something along thelines of “Thank you God for creating the ingredients that make up MintMilanos!”). Then I blissfully toss a few back.BRAVING THE BLESSING BEEYou’re probably familiar with school spelling bees. Well, in the yeshivas(yeh-shee-vahs; Jewish schools) my children went to, they didn’t have spellingbees — they had “blessing bees.” They were actually called Bracha (brah-khah)Bees. The teacher would name a food, and the students would have to recite theblessing appropriate for that food.BLESSINGS TO SAY AFTER EATINGAfter finishing a meal, a Kabbalist doesn’t just push away from the table. Ameal isn’t complete until grace is recited; it’s simply another way of saying“thanks.” The concept of eat and run is really unthinkable for a Kabbalist.When a Kabbalist eats alone, he or she recites the grace after meals by himselfor herself. When a group of people eat at the same table, the grace after mealshas a special introduction that brings everyone’s expression of gratitudetogether. But each person still recites the grace after meals individually.Nobody can say it for anyone else.There are a few different forms of grace after meals:bullet [Images/check.png] After a full meal (that is, one that begins withbread), a series of four blessings may be said.bullet [Images/check.png] After having a snack, a shorter grace is recited.In either case, Kabbalists know that God provides them with nourishment andtherefore must be thanked. The texts of these words of thanks can be found inthe traditional prayer book.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Whether one says the traditional words of thanks or not, Kabbalists believe thata “thank you” is essential.REPAIRING THE WORLDIn Chapter 8, I explain the Kabbalistic idea that the world, by definition, isin need of repair. Kabbalists believe that God didn’t finish the world and thathumans need to participate in the creation of the world by adding to it andrepairing it.The process of repairing the world, known as tikkun olam (tee-koon oh-lahm ),and acts of lovingkindness, known as gemilut hasadim, are quite similar. Infact, the two concepts overlap. I would say that acts of lovingkindness are waysto repair the world, but they’re generally interpersonal in their nature.Repairing of the world isn’t an assignment for professionals or specialists —everyone participates. Every Kabbalist knows that, and every Kabbalist issupposed to be conscious, all day long, of the countless opportunities toparticipate in the repair process.Of the many ways to repair the world each day, here are a few:bullet [Images/check.png] Social actionbullet [Images/check.png] Recyclingbullet [Images/check.png] Making the world a better placebullet [Images/check.png] Supporting medical researchbullet [Images/check.png] Picking up some garbage from the sidewalkbullet [Images/check.png] Writing a letter to the editor of the newspaperbullet [Images/check.png] Teaching one’s children something importantBED SHEETS AND BALANCE SHEETS: ENDING THE DAYIn the same way that a Kabbalist doesn’t wake or navigate his or her day withoutthinking about God, going to bed requires special consciousness. After all,every moment of every day for a Kabbalist must be infused withGod-consciousness.MAKING A NIGHTLY ACCOUNTINGA Kabbalist doesn’t just climb into bed at the end of each day. The day that’sending was a gift from God. The day began with a statement of gratitude forproviding the Kabbalist with another opportunity to enjoy the world’s pleasuresand to engage in holy acts (flip back to the section “Cultivating gratitude atthe first moment of consciousness” earlier in this chapter). The end of the dayhas its appropriate Kabbalistic activity, Cheshbon Hanefesh (kez- bone hah-neh-fesh; an accounting of the soul), which involves looking back on the day andexamining it in detail by considering these questions:bullet [Images/check.png] What did I do right?bullet [Images/check.png] What did I do wrong?bullet [Images/check.png] What could I have improved?bullet [Images/check.png] How may I have hurt someone?bullet [Images/check.png] How may I have not been conscious?bullet [Images/check.png] Were my ethical goals for the day met?bullet [Images/check.png] What will my ethical goals for tomorrow be?MEDITATING ON THE ONENESS OF THE UNIVERSE BEFORE FALLING ASLEEPAs I explain earlier in this chapter (see “Focusing on the oneness of theuniverse: A daily Kabbalistic meditation”), the Sh’ma is a meditation on God’soneness. This meditation happens twice a day for the Kabbalist — in the morningand at night — because of a statement found in the Torah indicating that peopleshould meditate on God’s oneness “when we lie down and when we rise up.” Thewords of the Sh’ma are the same each time: Hear O Israel, the Lord Our God, theLord is One.Kabbalists always want to be deliberate about the things they say and do, sowith the Sh’ma, they think long and hard about the oneness of the world. Anexample of this oneness lies in an ancient teaching that the reason God createdAdam and didn’t create many other people at the same time is so that nobody cansay, “My ancestor was greater than yours.” The human family, despite all theraces, religions, and nations, is really one human family.HANDLING BAD DREAMSKabbalists take dreams seriously. They have a traditional belief that dreamsoften signal things to come, so if a Kabbalist has a bad dream, he or she mayperform a ritual in order to express the hope that the dream is for the bestdespite the bad feelings it generates. The ritual consists of finding threefriends and telling them the dream; the dreamer and the friends then declarethat the dream should be interpreted for the good. (A specific text providingthe words to this ritual can be found in the traditional prayer book used byKabbalists.) Because Kabbalists believe that everything is for the best, it mustbe possible to interpret even a bad dream in a positive way.Another aspect to the oneness of everything is reflected in environmentalissues. Even 2,000 years ago, Kabbalists were keenly aware that people have animpact on the environment of their neighbors. They developed laws to protectneighbors from bad environmental practices. For example, if someone gathered apile of animal dung to be used as fuel or fertilizer, that person had to beconscious of where that pile was put and if it was downwind from the neighbors."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10LIVING ONE WEEK AT A TIMEIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Grasping the Kabbalistic significance of the Sabbathbullet [Images/arrow.png] Preparing for the Sabbath all week longbullet [Images/arrow.png] Demystifying Sabbath rituals and activitiesThere’s an old saying that “More than the Jews keep the Sabbath, the Sabbathkeeps the Jews.” This saying is surely true for Kabbalists. The Jewish Sabbathisn’t only the focus of the week for Kabbalists, but its tranquility is said tobe “a taste of the world to come.”The Sabbath, which starts Friday at sundown and ends Saturday at sundown, isn’tsimply a day that a Kabbalist just runs into. Rather, Kabbalists prepare for theSabbath all week long. And when it comes, they savor every detail.In this chapter, I take a close look at how Kabbalists prepare for the Sabbath,how it’s observed and celebrated, and the supplies that one needs for fullparticipation. I also briefly explore the other days of the week and how thosedays lead up to the holy day of the Sabbath.THE END OF THE WEEK IS ALSO THE BEGINNINGFor Kabbalists, the week has six days, not seven. The seventh day, Shabbat(shah-bot; Sabbath), isn’t really a day at all. According to Kabbalists, theSabbath is a special entity totally unlike the six days of the week. They viewit both as the launching pad for the week as well as the week’s culmination.Kabbalists derive energy for the new week from the special qualities of Shabbat,and Shabbat is also the result of the week’s effort, a time to enjoy and reapthe benefits of six days of hard work.Kabbalists learn about Shabbat from the first chapters of the Bible. The texttells that God created the world in six days and that on the seventh “day,” Godrested. According to Kabbalistic tradition, God’s rest isn’t like human restbecause God constantly creates and sustains the world. Nonetheless, Shabbat isoften referred to as “a day of rest,” and, as I discuss in the section “Beingbusy doing nothing” later in this chapter, the notion of rest has a very specialand particular meaning in Kabbalistic tradition.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The Kabbalistic view of time is different than the usual notion of linear timethat flows in one direction. In Kabbalah, time isn’t linear; rather, it goes ina spiral. In this way, Kabbalists return each day, week, and year to a time andplace that are similar to the last round, but hopefully, because people progressspiritually, at a higher level.The sense of nonlinear time is reflected in the fact that neither of the twomost important spiritual texts studied by Kabbalists, the Torah and the Talmud,has a beginning or an end. When Kabbalists read a portion of the Torah each weekand come to the end, what appears to be the end is merely a prelude to a newbeginning, where the new round begins again. Similarly, the Talmud has nobeginning or end, which is one of the reasons the Talmud is referred to as a“sea.” Students of Talmud study in a certain sequence, and when they reach theplace that looks like an end, the next moment is merely a new beginning of thesame cycle.KEEPING YOUR EYE ON THE SABBATHKabbalists always have Shabbat in mind regardless of the day of the week. Infact, for Kabbalists the days of the week don’t have their own names, likeSunday, Monday, and so on. Rather, the names of the individual days of the weekrelate to Shabbat. In Hebrew, Sunday is Yom Rishon (yohm ree-shown; the firstday), Monday is Yom Sheni (yohm shay-nee; the second day), and the rest of thedays follow this pattern.The consciousness and the kavanah (kah-vah-nah; inner intention) of theKabbalist is that every day of the week brings one closer to Shabbat. During theweek, Kabbalists experience heightened anticipation as the special period ofShabbat approaches. The work that the Kabbalist does during the week is intendedto repair the world as well as to earn a livelihood, but in its depth, the workof the six days of the week is all part of the preparation for Shabbat.In fact, it’s been said that many Kabbalists throughout history never worried orplanned for any day other than the next Shabbat. Some saintly individuals havegone so far as to believe and act as though one need not make any more moneythan what’s necessary to bring oneself and one’s family through the week inorder to celebrate Shabbat.When Shabbat is over, the round of the week is renewed, and the Kabbalist againhas his eye on the next Shabbat. As the days of the week roll on, Kabbalistsfeel a tangible ascent to the period of time known as the holy Shabbat.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my Kabbalah teachers often says, “If you think you’ve arrived, you arelost.” In other words, a Kabbalist is always striving for a better future. Theidea of living in the present as much as possible is certainly wise, but duringeach week, the Kabbalist also longs for a return of Shabbat just as during hislife, the Kabbalist yearns for the coming of the Messiah.PREPARING TO RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE SABBATHKabbalists see Shabbat as a gift from above. When one understands how toappropriately participate in the Kabbalistic celebration of Shabbat, one trulyanticipates this special time as though it’s a gift to be received. In thissection, I share with you what it takes to prepare to receive the gift ofShabbat.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Countless people who begin to explore the life of the traditional Kabbalist runin the other direction when they confront the tremendous number of requirementsthat Kabbalistic tradition asks of the Kabbalist, especially the requirementsrelated to preparing for and observing the Sabbath. Kabbalah isn’t some New Agehobby through which one can receive a quick fix or an inspirational poem for thesoul. Kabbalah is hard work. The great masters of Kabbalah participated in analmost ceaseless effort to follow the divine commandments as passed down throughtradition, to understand those commandments in detail, and to ultimately aligntheir wills with the will of God.DON’T FORGET THAT “KABBALAH” MEANS “TO RECEIVE”Etymologically, the word “Kabbalah” comes from the Hebrew root which means “toreceive.” A story from Buddhist tradition captures the very idea of Kabbalah asa receiving.A student went to a Buddhist master and asked if he would accept him as astudent. The teacher consented and then said, “First let’s have some tea.” TheMaster prepared the tea and began pouring tea from the kettle into a cup. Thecup slowly but surely filled to the brim, and the master continued to pour. Thestudent, noticing the tea overflowing from the rim of the cup, exclaimed,“Master, Master! The cup is full and overflowing.” The Master put down the teakettle, smiled, and said, “You have now received your first lesson; unless youcome empty, with room within you to receive, you will never make any progress asmy student.”Similarly, a student of Kabbalah should be open and filled with a desire toreceive the tradition. This ability to receive certainly pertains to the arrivalof the Sabbath. A Kabbalist who knows that he or she is about to receive a giftmust make room for that gift. Without carving out room in one’s heart and soulto be a true recipient of the Sabbath, one can’t feel its sanctity or experienceits holiness. To be a Kabbalist is to always be prepared to receive gifts fromabove.GETTING IN THE RIGHT FRAME OF MINDAccording to Kabbalistic tradition, the quality of Shabbat is the direct resultof one’s preparation for it. If you travel through the week with littleconsciousness, anticipation, or preparation for Shabbat, the result is a ratherbland Shabbat. On the other hand, if you truly experience the ascent of the weektowards Shabbat and truly feel that the week is an opportunity to climb to thespiritual height that Shabbat provides, the result should be a sublime Shabbatfilled with joy, pleasure, and sanctity.When the sun goes down on Saturday night, Kabbalists don’t merely begin a newweek. Rather, they begin their ascent to the next holy Sabbath. Although Sundayand Monday may begin slowly and without much anticipation of the Sabbath, byTuesday and Wednesday, Kabbalists can truly feel the coming arrival of theSabbath.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]A Kabbalah teacher taught me that one of the most important preparations for theSabbath is to cultivate a willingness to receive it and taste it. A passage fromthe Torah reveals an aspect of this attitude. The Torah says that when theChildren of Israel accepted the Torah from above, they responded with an unusualphrase, Na’aseh V’nishmah (nah-ah-seh vah-nish-mah; We will do and we will hearor We will do and we will understand [Exodus 24:7]).This phrase reflects the opposite of what people usually do in life, which issay that they want to understand something before they do it. Essentially, theystand with their arms folded and say, “First prove it to me, and then I’llconsider tasting it or doing it.” The Kabbalist, however, says, “First I’ll doit, and then I’ll understand it.” Understanding, represented by the secondsefirah of Binah, leads to knowledge, which is the third sefirah of Da’at (seeChapter 4). According to Kabbalah, true knowing comes from the experienceitself.VISITING AND USING A 500-YEAR-OLD MIKVAHThe mystical city of Tzfat, Israel, is where Rabbi Isaac Luria, known as thegreatest Kabbalist who ever lived, resided. (On maps, it is often spelled“Safed,” but “Tzfat” is closer to its correct pronunciation.) Tzfat has a mikvahthat’s believed to have been used by Rabbi Isaac Luria himself. This mikvah,which is located in a cave, has attracted countless people over the centuries.When I visited Israel recently, I tracked down an old friend of mine who used tobe a devoted Grateful Dead fan and who now lives in Tzfat with his wife andchildren and leads the life of a Kabbalist. The very first thing we did was walkto the mikvah of Rabbi Isaac Luria and submerge ourselves in that ritual bath.The water was icy, but the experience was sublime. Knowing that countlessKabbalists (including Rabbi Isaac Luria) and others throughout the ages had usedthe mikvah made the experience deeply meaningful.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]IT’S WHAT’S INSIDE THAT COUNTSA Kabbalist related to his teacher that his little town had two bakeries. Heexplained that because his town was small and both bakers struggled to make aliving, he felt that it was important to do business with both bakers and to buyhis challah from both.One baker wove beautifully braided challah, but his recipe wasn’t that great.The other baker seemed unable to create beautifully braided challah, but hisrecipe was quite exceptional and delicious.The Kabbalist asked his teacher, “For the honor of Shabbat, would it be moreappropriate to use the beautifully braided challah whose recipe is mediocre orthe delicious challah whose shape is unattractive?” The teacher responded thatthe student should use the unattractive challah with a delicious taste becausethe inner beauty of something — not its superficial external beauty — is ofgreatest importance.DIPPING IN A RITUAL BATHSince time immemorial, Kabbalists have submerged themselves in a ritual bathknown as a mikvah (mik -vah). It’s generally known among Jews that women whoobserve the Jewish laws of family purity visit a mikvah each month. What’s notgenerally known is the Kabbalistic tradition of submerging oneself in a mikvahevery day of the year or, if that frequency is impractical, at least once a week(either before the Sabbath on Friday afternoon or on the morning of theSabbath). Countless Hasidim throughout the world observe this Kabbalisticpractice.Similar to a baptism, submersion in a mikvah isn’t a physical cleansing (noscrubbing behind the ears) but rather is a spiritual cleansing. One enters andsubmerges in a mikvah completely naked. Even rings are removed so that the watertouches every part of the body without any barrier.Most communities that are home to a significant number of traditional Jews havemikvahs. Specifications must be met for the construction of an acceptabletraditional mikvah. It must be built in the ground or as a part of a building.Therefore, a portable receptacle, like a bathtub or Jacuzzi, can never functionas a mikvah. A mikvah must contain a minimum of 200 gallons of rainwatergathered into the mikvah in accordance with a specific set of traditionalregulations. Where the acquisition of rainwater isn’t possible, ice or snoworiginating from a natural source may be used to fill the mikvah.CHECKING OFF SABBATH ESSENTIALSIn the same way that a hunter must gather his supplies for a hunting trip, abaseball player must gather his equipment in preparation for a game, and a chefmust gather his tools and utensils for the kitchen, a Kabbalist needs to makesome specific preparations in order to be well-equipped and prepared for thearrival of Shabbat. The following items are required:bullet [Images/check.png] Fresh clean clothes: Kabbalists anticipate the Sabbatheach week by designating the fine clothing that they’ll wear both to greetShabbat on Friday night and to live through the Shabbat day. It’s not unusualfor a Kabbalist to select his or her finest clothes and make sure that they’resparkling clean as a way of preparing for the Sabbath. After purchasing newclothing, many Kabbalists wait until Shabbat to wear them for the first time inhonor of the holy Sabbath.Kabbalists recite a special blessing when wearing new clothing for the firsttime: Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, who clothes thenaked.bullet [Images/check.png] Candles: Candles are important for the celebration ofShabbat. On Friday night, just as the Sabbath arrives, Kabbalistic householdslight at least two candles as a symbolic gesture of bringing the light of theSabbath into their lives. At the close of Shabbat, Kabbalists use candles duringthe ceremony known as havdalah (hav-dah-lah), in which they bid the Sabbathgoodbye and hope that the light of the Sabbath will remain and illuminate thedays of the week to come.Sabbath candles are readily available in many large supermarkets. Candles usedin the havdalah ritual are commonly available in Jewish bookstores and can beordered from many Web sites. Havdalah candle makers pride themselves ondesigning havdalah candles that are colorful and woven together in aparticularly ornate fashion.bullet [Images/check.png] The fruit of the vine: An important item forcelebrating Shabbat is either grape juice or wine, which are interchangeablewhen a Kabbalistic ritual calls for “the fruit of the vine.” Other than on theholy day of Purim (see Chapter 11), which traditionally encourages the drinkingof wine or other alcoholic beverages (and when it’s okay to get a little tipsy),the wine the Kabbalist drinks on Shabbat isn’t meant to be consumed excessively.A Kabbalist should surely avoid getting drunk on Shabbat.bullet [Images/check.png] A cup: Kabbalists use a special cup at least threetimes during the Sabbath:• They fill the cup with grape juice or wine at the beginning of the Sabbath onFriday evening.• They drink grape juice or wine from the cup during lunch on the Sabbath.• They drink grape juice or wine from the cup during the goodbye ceremony(havdalah) at the end of the Sabbath.Cups used during the Sabbath are often ornate or decorative. Most Kabbalists whocan afford it use one cup exclusively for Shabbat and other holy days.Kabbalists are known to use beautiful cups in the Kiddush (kih-doosh) ritual,but a cup used for Kiddush isn’t a sacred object — it’s merely a cup (see Figure10-1). Nevertheless, Kabbalists have a time-honored tradition known as hidurmitzvah (hih-dur mitz-vah; beautification of the mitzvah). This tradition callsfor an effort to make all the items used for sacred purposes as beautiful aspossible. Therefore, Kabbalists try to find particularly attractive cups.Throughout Jewish history, there have been a number of efforts to encouragesumptuary laws when it comes to spending, or rather overspending, on ritualobjects as well as general objects and events. For example, rabbis havecriticized the excessiveness of lavish wedding parties for centuries.Nonetheless, an effort to beautify ritual objects is always appropriate andencouraged.bullet [Images/check.png] Two loaves of bread: A careful reading of the Torahresults in a number of ritual actions. One such ritual is the presence of twoloaves of bread to complete the Shabbat dinner table. Ordinarily, a table may ormay not have a loaf of bread as part of the meal. But on the Sabbath, Kabbalistsmake sure to have two loaves of bread on their tables as a reminder that, whenthe children of Israel fled Egypt and wandered in the desert, one of themiracles they experienced was the manna (food) that they gathered each day andate. The Torah explains that on Friday, in order to prevent the need to gathermanna on the Sabbath, the children of Israel gathered two portions forthemselves.Figure 10-1: Kiddush cups come in many styles; some are quite ornate. This oneis simple and quite popular.Figure 10-1: Kiddush cups come in many styles; some are quite ornate. This oneis simple and quite popular. [Images/915904 fg1001.jpg]Loaves of challah (khah-lah; egg bread; see Figure 10-2) used on Shabbat areoften quite beautiful. Often, they’re made from two or three strands of doughthat are braided. Although this design isn’t essential, the braided loaves havebecome customary among Kabbalists. Kabbalists display the challah on the Sabbathdinner table underneath a cloth covering referred to as a challah cover. Thechallah cover represents the layer of dew that, the Torah states, the childrenof Israel found each day on the manna.The Sabbath table is considered an altar. In fact, it’s a substitute locationfor the Temple that once stood in Jerusalem. The home of the Kabbalist is anintimate temple, and the challah and its braids may be viewed as the braidingtogether of the souls present in holy dialogue in the sacred center of theKabbalist’s life, the home.bullet [Images/check.png] A white tablecloth: It’s traditional among Kabbaliststo cover the Shabbat dinner table with a white tablecloth. The combination ofthe white tablecloth and the lit candles help to transform the weekday householdinto a sanctuary and a holy space. The white color of the tablecloth conveyspurity to the space; in Judaism, white is the color of transformation, as wornby a bride.bullet [Images/check.png] Sweet-smelling spices: Kabbalists need to have clovesor some other sweet fragrant spices on hand to be used during the havdalahceremony at the end of the Sabbath. It’s customary for the Kabbalist to obtain abeautiful spice box that holds the spices for the havdalah ceremony. Judaicastores, of which there are dozens throughout the United States and online, sellextremely attractive havdalah sets consisting of a decorative cup, an equallydecorative holder for the havdalah candle, and a beautiful spice box.Figure 10-2: Loaves of braided bread are an essential part of the Shabbat table.Figure 10-2: Loaves of braided bread are an essential part of the Shabbat table.[Images/915904 fg1002.jpg]GREETING THE SABBATH THE KABBALISTIC WAYFriday afternoon is filled with great anticipation and busy preparation towelcome the arrival of Shabbat. For instance, Kabbalists make sure to bathe orshower before putting on their fresh and fancy clothing (see the precedingsection), and they finish up the preparation of the festive meals (becauseKabbalists don’t cook food on the Sabbath). As well, Kabbalists make sure thatproper and practical lighting is already set before sundown on the Sabbath sothat one doesn’t have to turn lights and lamps on or off during the holy time(lighting fires or turning on and off lights in prohibited on the Sabbath), andsome even have an extra supply of hot water available in order to avoid havingto heat water, which is considered work and is therefore prohibited on theSabbath. Modern Kabbalists even have special urns that keep water hot so thatit’s available if and when needed during the holy time of Shabbat.With all these activities taking place, one senses a hustle and bustle amongSabbath observers, sometimes at a frenzied pace, filled with enthusiasm andanticipation. When Shabbat arrives, however, the frenzied pace quickly turns toan aura of tranquility.In this section, I clue you in on two activities — lighting candles and singingsongs — that kick off Shabbat the right way.LIGHTING THE SABBATH CANDLESTo inaugurate the Sabbath, signifying that the sun has gone down Fridayafternoon and that the week is over, a Kabbalist lights two candles and recitesthe following blessing: Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, whohas sanctified us by His commandments, and has commanded us to kindle theSabbath lights. The phrase “who has sanctified us by His commandments” appearsin many blessings that refer to specific ritual acts; it acknowledges that thecommandment from God is a gift offered from above. God sanctifies people bygiving this commandment. Kabbalists don’t experience commandments as a bunch ofrules. Rather, a Kabbalist sees every commandment as a gift of sanctificationgiven by God to those ready to receive it.Kabbalists report that the act of lighting candles to inaugurate the Sabbath andthe presence of those candles in the home lends an aura of sanctity to thespace. As one Kabbalist said, “When candles are lit on the eve of the Sabbath,one can see how a plain room can be transformed into a spiritual sanctuary.”Lighting candles during a ritual is an act of particularly special significancebecause one of the strongest images among Kabbalists comes from the book ofProverbs: “The soul of man is a candle of God” (Proverbs 20:27).The candle is both a popular and serious object of Kabbalistic meditation. ManyKabbalists have written books over the centuries addressing the significance oflight and, in particular, the light that rises from the wick of a candle. Thevarious colors of the flame, the upward reach of the flame, and the candle as avessel that contains the light (a parallel to the vessel of the body thatcontains the soul) are just a few examples of the symbolic significance ofcandles.Kabbalists go to a synagogue to participate in a special Kabbalistic prayerservice welcoming the Sabbath. When they come home from the synagogue, theyreturn to a new space lit by the Sabbath candles, signaling that the divine giftof the Sabbath has been given and is being received.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The candles that are lit to inaugurate the Sabbath don’t serve any utilitarianpurpose — they aren’t intended to light a room, create a romantic mood, or makeit possible to read in a dark room. They have a spiritual and symbolic nature;ultimately, they serve as a reminder of the primary goal of all Kabbalists,which is to bring God’s divine light into the world. Always paramount for theKabbalist is this idea that God’s light is hidden in the world and theKabbalist’s job is to help to reveal it.SINGING SPECIAL SONGSThroughout the centuries, Kabbalists have followed the practice of singing anumber of songs week after week. One such song, which is usually sung in thesynagogue service that welcomes the Sabbath, is called “L’cha Dodi” (leh-chahdoe-dee ). It was written by a rabbi named Shlomo HaLevi Alkabetz. Here are thelyrics:“Keep” and “Remember,” a single word the Only God caused us to hear. The Lord isOne, and his Name is One, in renown and glory and praise.Come, let us go to meet Shabbat, for she is the fountain of blessing, pouredfrom the beginning, from of old, the last deed, [but] first in intention.Royal sanctuary, kingly city, arise, leave the ruins. Long enough have you satin a valley of tears — for with compassion He will pity you.Shake yourself free! Rise from the dust! O my people, be clothed in garments ofsplendor! Nearby, the son of Jesse, the Bethlehem-ite, my soul’s redemption, hasapproached her.Awake, awake, for your light has come! Arise and shine, rise, awake, sing; theglory of the Lord has revealed itself over you.Be not ashamed; feel no disgrace. Why are you cast down? Why do you groan? Inyou the afflicted of my people will seek refuge. The city will be [re]built onits mound of ruins.Your plunderers will be plundered, and those who devoured you will be gone; yourGod will rejoice over you, as a bridegroom exults over a bride.You will overflow north and south, and you will fear the Lord. Nearby, thepromised one! Let us rejoice and exult!Enter in peace, O crown of your husband, with gladness and rejoicing, among thefaithful of [God’s] treasured people! Draw near, O bride; approach, O bride!The metaphor of the Sabbath as a bride is fitting in that the special innerattitude that the Kabbalist must cultivate in preparation for receiving theSabbath is comparable to the excitement and anticipation a husband has for hisnew bride. The Kabbalist renews his Sabbath anticipation and excitement eachweek, and songs like “L’cha Dodi” inspire such an inner attitude, or kavanah.TRANSFORMING THE SHABBAT DINNER TABLE INTO A HOLY ALTARFor the Kabbalist, eating is a holy act connected to God, the source of allholiness. A salt shaker sits on the dining table of every Kabbalist andaccompanies every full meal. The presence of the salt shaker is directlyconnected to the holy altar located within the holy Temple in Jerusalem, whichalways included a source of salt. Keeping a source of salt on the dining tableis the Kabbalist’s way of transforming the table into a holy altar. With salt ona table, the mundane surface takes on a higher purpose.Whereas a salt shaker is always present at the Kabbalist’s table, other itemsand activities are special to Shabbat celebrations. This section covers some ofthe most important ones.BLESSING THE CHILDRENKabbalists firmly believe in the power of blessings. They believe that theconscious transfer of blessing from one person to another, although intangible,is real, perhaps even more so than physical reality.It has been a custom among Kabbalists for many centuries to raise one’s handsover the heads of one’s children and to bless them at the dinner table at thebeginning of the Sabbath. The text of the blessing is: The Lord bless you, andkeep you; The Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; TheLord lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace (Numbers 6:24–26).If this blessing sounds familiar to you, it’s probably because the very sameblessing that Kabbalists have offered to their children over the centuries hasbeen recited at the inauguration of American presidents from time to time.During one inauguration, the Reverend Billy Graham was invited to offer ablessing, and he chose this one. It’s also the priestly blessing recited by thepriesthood in the holy Temple in Jerusalem.SINGING A KABBALISTIC LOVE SONG TO YOUR PARTNERKabbalists recite the very last chapter from the book of Proverbs at the Shabbatdinner table. On its surface, the text of this chapter appears to be a tributeto the wife, the woman of the household, the beautiful, capable, and a holymarriage partner. Indeed, husbands often recite this chapter to their wives onthe eve of the Sabbath. Even when there are no women present at a Shabbat table,these verses are sung in honor of Jewish women everywhere.A worthy woman who can find? For her price is far above rubies.The heart of her husband safely trusts in her, and he shall have no lack ofgain.She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.She seeks wool, and flax, and works willingly with her hands.She is like the ships of the merchant; she brings her food from far away.She rises also while it is yet night, and gives food to her household, and aportion to her maidens.She considers a field, and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants avineyard.She girds her loins with strength, and makes her arms strong.She perceives that her merchandise is good; her candle does not go out by night.She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.She stretches out her hand to the poor; she reaches forth her hands to theneedy.She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household areclothed with scarlet.She makes herself coverlets; her clothing is fine linen and purple.Her husband is known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.She makes linen garments, and sells them; and delivers girdles to the merchant.Strength and dignity are her clothing; and she shall rejoice at the time tocome.She opens her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the Torah oflovingkindness.She looks well to the ways of her household, and does not eat the bread ofidleness.Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praisesher.Many daughters have done virtuously, but you excel them all.Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman who fears the Lord shall bepraised.Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own deeds praise her in thegates.RECITING THE 23RD PSALMAt the Sabbath table on Friday night, Kabbalists read from the book of Psalms,specifically the 23rd Psalm, popularly known as “The Lord is my Shepherd.” Asmoving and as beautiful a poem as King David ever wrote, the 23rd Psalm reflectsthe steadfast and unwavering faith that the Kabbalist has in God.The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.He makes me lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside still waters.He restores my soul; he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name’ssake.Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear noevil; for you are with me; your rod and your staff comfort me.You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my headwith oil; my cup runs over.Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life; andI will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.God is the Shepherd of the Kabbalist, as the very first words of the Psalmindicate. The next statement acknowledges God as an eternally wise provider whoknows just what a person needs and provides for those needs. When reciting the23rd Psalm, the Kabbalist acknowledges God’s generosity and the great bountythat God offers.Perhaps the most famous line from this Psalm is “Even though I walk through thevalley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for you are with me.” Thisstatement dramatically reflects the Kabbalistic attitude toward both death andGod: Death shouldn’t be feared but rather acknowledged as God’s will, and Goddidn’t create the world and leave it alone but rather is always with his people.With the startling words “your rod and your staff comfort me,” the Kabbalistexpresses the belief that whatever God allows to happen is actually known inGod’s wisdom to be for the best — even to the point that a rod and a staff aresources of comfort.The 23rd Psalm is a deep and exquisitely beautiful poem, and by reciting it weekafter week, year after year, the Kabbalist etches these words and their meaningindelibly into his or her heart, mind, and soul.GETTING WET UP TO THE WRISTSIt’s an ancient Kabbalistic belief that a person’s hands are particularlysusceptible to spiritual impurity. So it should come as no surprise to find outthat Kabbalists practice a very specific symbolic ritual when they wash theirhands at the beginning of a meal.Have you ever noticed that sometimes your hands get wet but the water simplyrolls off and doesn’t seem to have an impact on the skin? The skin may retain noevidence of outside moisture because of body oils that prevent the water fromactually touching the skin. For this reason, when Kabbalists pour water overtheir hands before eating, they pour water over each hand at least twice andsometimes three times. The first time is merely to get the hands a little wet sothat the second pouring can hopefully contact the hands in their entirety. Also,Kabbalists are careful to make sure that the entire hand, from the wrist to thetips of the fingernails, gets wet. They also always remove finger rings toguarantee that the water touches the hands in their entirety. In manyhouseholds, a traditional cup with two handles is used to make it easier to pourwater over each hand one at a time (see Figure 10-3).Figure 10-3: Each hand needs to be completely wet; the two handles allow you toeasily wet one hand at a time.Figure 10-3: Each hand needs to be completely wet; the two handles allow you toeasily wet one hand at a time. [Images/915904 fg1003.jpg]The washing of the hands also includes a lifting of the hands — the hands areraised up after they’re washed and dried. In fact, the blessing recited uponwashing one’s hands refers not to washing them but lifting them. Symbolically,it may be seen as a lifting up of one’s intentions.What is this hand-washing all about? Simply put, preparing one’s hands andsymbolically cleansing them of spiritual impurity enhances the spiritual natureof the meal. Kabbalists don’t wash their hands with soap and water and then digin. Rather, they immerse their hands symbolically in an act of spiritualpurification and then return to the table for a meal that’s far more thanphysical nourishment. The ritual transforms a mundane dinner table into a holyaltar. At the altar in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, the priests washed theirhands in this manner, so performing the ritual in one’s home on the Sabbathconnects the home with the Holy Temple.KNOWING THE CHOREOGRAPHY OF THE SABBATH EVENING MEALAt the Kabbalist’s Sabbath table (see Figure 10-4), after blessing the childrenand reciting the 23rd Psalm and the last chapter of the book of Proverbs, themeal officially begins with a recitation of the Kiddush (kih-doosh ).Every detail of the Kiddush ritual, which involves a blessing over the fruit ofthe vine (grape juice or wine), has Kabbalistic significance: the color of thewine, the specific number of words in the blessing, the cup filled to the brim,and the way in which the cup is held in one’s hands. The ritual is rich withsymbolism; each detail reflects ideas and images from Kabbalistic tradition.For example, the cup of wine, which is filled to the very top, reflects back tothe line in the 23rd Psalm, “My cup runs over.” On the Sabbath eve, with thetranquility of the Sabbath present and the rewards of the workday weekmanifesting in a delicious meal, the almost-overflowing cup of wine reflects thebounty that God bestows upon his people and prompts gratitude.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]A Kabbalist would never eat a meal with someone else without “talking Torah.”That is, Kabbalists are taught to elevate the activity of eating in many ways,one of which is by bringing God’s teachings into the conversation. Particularlyduring the Sabbath meal, the conversation shouldn’t focus on the latestheadlines or recent films in the local theater. Rather, conversation during theSabbath meal should focus on the holy, whether it be teachings from sacred textsor the retelling of stories with eternal, spiritual messages. Additionally,every Shabbat table is surrounded by people with sacred songs on their lips. Thetraditional Jewish prayer book (as well as other books published for theoccasion) contains songs that are particularly popular for singing on Shabbat.Figure 10-4: A family welcoming Shabbat with candles, wine, and two loaves ofchallah. The father puts his hands on the children’s heads while blessing them,and the mother covers her eyes.Figure 10-4: A family welcoming Shabbat with candles, wine, and two loaves ofchallah. The father puts his hands on the children’s heads while blessing them,and the mother covers her eyes. [Images/915904 fg1004.jpg]Every meal that a Kabbalist eats, which traditionally includes a fish appetizerfollowed by a meat or chicken dish, concludes with grace after meals, known asBirchat Hamazon (beer-khaht hah-mah-zone; see Chapter 15). The Kabbalistic graceafter meals is a series of four blessings plus an expression of gratitude by therecipients of the food to its creator for the bounty that God has provided.OBSERVING AND ENJOYING THE SABBATHKabbalists refer to the Sabbath with two terms: shamor (shah-more; guarding) andzachor (zah-khor; remembering). Guarding the Sabbath and remembering the Sabbathare two distinct activities. The terms go back to the first books of the Torah,where the Children of Israel are commanded to guard the Sabbath (Deuteronomy5:12) and remember the Sabbath (Exodus 20:8). Despite the distinctions, bothactivities connect with the general injunction to receive the Sabbath from Godas a gift.Kabbalists throughout the centuries have taken the tradition of guarding andremembering the Sabbath quite seriously, even to the extent of being careful toobserve a great number of laws pertaining to Sabbath observance. For example,the Kabbalist doesn’t light two candles to inaugurate the Sabbath and then go toa Las Vegas hotel for the evening to gamble at the blackjack table. Even ifgambling is the most restful and relaxing activity a person can think of, itisn’t in the spirit of the Sabbath and isn’t permissible according to the Jewishlaws that Kabbalists have observed for many centuries.In this section, I explain a few of the most importance ways Kabbalists observethe Sabbath and how these observances bring peace and joy to a Kabbalist’s life.BEING BUSY DOING NOTHINGWarning(bomb) [Images/Warning(bomb).jpg]People often mistakenly think that the biblical prohibition against doing workon the Sabbath only pertains to physical labor and that it’s permissible andappropriate to work on one’s self, one’s inner life, and one’s character traits.On Shabbat, no work is done — neither on the physical world nor on one’s self.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my Kabbalah teachers points out that it’s such a pity to see the numberof people in the world who are eager for peace of mind. Some people take classesto attain peace of mind, some take drugs, and some try meditation and othertechniques, all of which are a waste of time if the goal is to attain peace ofmind. As my teacher points out, a fundamental principle of Kabbalah is thatpeace of mind is actually quite unattainable during one’s life because the humansoul has two aspects:bullet [Images/check.png] Yetzer hatov (yay-tzer hah-tov; the good urge)bullet [Images/check.png] Yetzer harah (yay-tzer hah-rah; the evil urge)These two aspects of the human soul are in constant battle with each other.However, the evil urge, the yetzer harah, isn’t really evil in and of itself.The great sages tell the story (as it appears in the Talmud) that when somepeople decided to capture the yetzer harah and lock it up in prison, the resultwas that houses weren’t built and babies weren’t born. This metaphorical storyimplies that the yetzer harah isn’t actually evil but rather is an impulse thatmay be used for constructive or destructive purposes.There’s no way to stop the battle between the yetzer hatov and yetzer harah, norwould one want to. According to Kabbalistic tradition, a goal of life is to usethe battle between the two urges as a source of creativity. The tension betweenthese two urges and hopefully the ultimate victory of one over the other (thegood over the evil) results in the repairing and the building of the world. Asmy teacher points out, the goal of life isn’t to end that battle but rather toraise that battle to the highest level possible, where the strife that the soulexperiences results in purification, ethical living, acts of lovingkindness, andprofound connection to God.During the week, the soul has no peace thanks to both the hard work that onedoes and the creative tension between the yetzer harah and yetzer hatov. Butthen comes Shabbat, when physical work is put on hold and, although one doesn’tturn off the mind, striving to reach goals isn’t the order of the day.THE PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: THE SABBATH IS GROUNDED IN STILLNESSDuring the week, most people, including Kabbalists, are busy working in theworld, at jobs away from home or in the home. Some people travel far and widecommuting to work or traveling for one reason or another. But on Shabbat,Kabbalists always stay close to home.For the Kabbalist, the spirit of Shabbat is to do little, if any, tampering withthe world. The Kabbalist is busy repairing the world during the six days of theweek because the world is unfinished or even broken (see the section “KeepingYour Eye on the Sabbath” earlier in this chapter). But as the sages teach,Shabbat is a taste of the world to come: a world without strife or great toil.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]DANCE STEPS, NOT DOS AND DON’TSMany people who have attempted to take on the myriad commandments andrestrictions incumbent upon the Kabbalist have found the task to be daunting andperhaps nearly impossible. One of the difficulties for the practitioner is thelist of thousands upon thousands of teachings about every human activity, eachof which has its own set of commandments and prohibitions. To outsiders, thetens of thousands of commandments incumbent upon the Kabbalist seem like a vastcollection of unrelated tasks.My Kabbalah teacher points out that if you get up close to a tree and look atthe intricate details of the leaves, branches, bark, and root system, you veryeasily can get lost in the great number of individual parts. But when you stepback, the details of the tree all come together into a wondrous whole.The same is true for the system of Jewish law incumbent upon the Kabbalist.Individually, the laws seem cumbersome and overly demanding. But when you enterthe system, you stop seeing the commandments and laws as annoyances from theoutside and instead see them as dance steps of an exquisite cosmic, spiritualchoreography.In addition, most teachers instruct that it isn’t necessary to take on theentire tradition at once. Not only is that next to impossible, but it’s almostsurely not healthy. A slow and steady progress is much more reliable whenbuilding a spiritual practice. Ultimately, the practice isn’t a matter of howmuch one does but rather one’s inner attitude and connection to God.Many people find this Kabbalistic practice to be quite difficult and challengingbecause radically changing the pace of one’s life every seven days isn’t exactlyeasy. But people who take on this spiritual practice after having not beenSabbath observers often look back and wonder how they did without it. TheSabbath is nourishing for the body and, more profoundly, the soul.39 DIFFERENT WAYS NOT TO WORK ON THE SABBATHFor Kabbalists, the traditional prohibition against work on the Sabbath isn’t asimple matter because this prohibition doesn’t merely imply that one takes aholiday or a weekend without going to work. Special prohibitions define whatwork is for the Kabbalist and therefore define what’s prohibited on Shabbat.Here’s a list of the 39 activities prohibited on the Sabbath:bullet [Images/check.png] Sowingbullet [Images/check.png] Plowingbullet [Images/check.png] Reapingbullet [Images/check.png] Binding sheavesbullet [Images/check.png] Threshingbullet [Images/check.png] Winnowingbullet [Images/check.png] Sortingbullet [Images/check.png] Grindingbullet [Images/check.png] Siftingbullet [Images/check.png] Kneadingbullet [Images/check.png] Bakingbullet [Images/check.png] Shearing woolbullet [Images/check.png] Washing woolbullet [Images/check.png] Beating woolbullet [Images/check.png] Dyeing woolbullet [Images/check.png] Spinningbullet [Images/check.png] Weavingbullet [Images/check.png] Making two loopsbullet [Images/check.png] Weaving two threadsbullet [Images/check.png] Separating two threadsbullet [Images/check.png] Tyingbullet [Images/check.png] Untyingbullet [Images/check.png] Sewing two stitchesbullet [Images/check.png] Tearingbullet [Images/check.png] Trappingbullet [Images/check.png] Slaughteringbullet [Images/check.png] Flayingbullet [Images/check.png] Salting meatbullet [Images/check.png] Curing hidebullet [Images/check.png] Scraping hidebullet [Images/check.png] Cutting up hidebullet [Images/check.png] Writing two lettersbullet [Images/check.png] Erasing two lettersbullet [Images/check.png] Buildingbullet [Images/check.png] Tearing a building downbullet [Images/check.png] Extinguishing a firebullet [Images/check.png] Kindling a firebullet [Images/check.png] Hitting with a hammerbullet [Images/check.png] Taking an object from the private domain to thepublic, or transporting an object in the public domainAs you may have guessed, these 39 activities have more than a superficialmeaning — they actually reflect abstract ideas that the Kabbalist can apply tomany situations. Take the category called threshing as an example. According totradition, one is forbidden to participate in the activity of threshing onShabbat. A modern Kabbalist may think that this is an easy one to avoid becausethreshing isn’t something the average person does on a regular basis (or atall!). Farmers tend to handle the job. However, according to Kabbalistictradition, the prohibition against threshing on Shabbat doesn’t really apply tothe specific and narrow activity of threshing as it would occur on a farm;rather, threshing reflects the abstract idea of separating one thing fromanother or extracting one thing that’s useful from what’s left behind and isn’tuseful. In modern terms, the notion of threshing extends, for example, to theactivity of squeezing the juice from a lemon. The person squeezing the lemonextracts what he or she wants (the lemon juice) and leaves behind what’sunwanted (the rind).This abstract description still applies to the concrete and specific activity ofthreshing, though, because it’s an activity whereby one separates a stalk ofwheat, taking its fruit and leaving behind the rest. So, although at firstglance squeezing the lemon and threshing seemed to be distinctly differentactivities, they’re essentially the same.The study of the 39 prohibited activities is a deep and complex one that hasbeen quite familiar to serious Kabbalists throughout the centuries.READING FROM THE HOLY SCROLLSKabbalists almost always participate in one particularly special Shabbatactivity: listening to the public reading of a portion from the Torah scroll,the Five Books of Moses. The central book for Kabbalist, without question, isthe Torah, and that special status is reflected in this custom.ENJOYING THE ONEG SHABBATIn many synagogues throughout the world, a time for refreshments follows theFriday night prayer service welcoming the Sabbath. Many synagogues call thisrefreshment time the oneg or oneg Shabbat. And many who don’t know any bettersurely have come to the conclusion that “oneg Shabbat” means coffee and cake (orperhaps bagels and herring!). In fact, “oneg Shabbat” means the “delight ofShabbat,” and although tasting and enjoying good food is certainly a delight, anoneg Shabbat for a Kabbalist is simply an extension of the great delight ofreceiving the Sabbath.The Five Books of Moses are divided up so that the entire thing can be read inone year’s annual cycle. Each week, a small portion is read. This public readinghas continued in the same cycle year after year for centuries, and every Jewishcommunity throughout the world is always focusing on the same Torah portion.Kabbalists make every effort either to attend a synagogue to hear the publicreading or, if that isn’t possible, to read the portion along with thecommentaries in private each week.MAKING SURE YOU EXPERIENCE DELIGHTAccording to Kabbalistic tradition, an essential component of the experience ofthe Sabbath is oneg (oh -neg; delight). On the chart of the ten sefirot (seh-fear -oat; divine channels), the first sefirah, Keter (crown), is said to beboth the source of “will” and “delight.” You can see the idea behind this dualsignificance of Keter by looking at the notion of will. When somebody wantssomething and uses her will to achieve it, the goal is always the same: delight.When a person desires something, she desires it because of the ultimate pleasureit will provide. This is the connection between will and delight. She willssomething because it brings her what she want, and what she wants, at its root,is always enjoyment or pleasure, or as Kabbalists say, oneg. (For more on thesefirot, check out Chapter 4.)Just as people do things for pleasure, God created the universe to bring Himselfpleasure. For the Kabbalist, nothing’s more meaningful than the idea that Godcreated the world because He wanted to. But, in fact, Kabbalistic tradition goesone step farther and combines the two notions of will and delight: God createdthe world because He wanted to, but the source of that wanting was pleasure.According to Kabbalah, this pleasure has duality: Not only is creation God’spleasure, but more significantly for humans, God created the world and humans inparticular so that humans could receive. And what is it that God wants humans toreceive? Pleasure! Therefore, the Sabbath as a gift from the Divine is thepinnacle of all God’s giving. God wills it that humans should experiencepleasure, and by receiving the Sabbath, Kabbalists receive a divine gift thatbrings delight.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]According to Kabbalistic tradition, the highest form of pleasure is knowledge ofGod. In fact, knowledge of God and connection to God is the heart’s desire andthe reason that God created humans in the first place. Even beneath thedisbelief of the nonbeliever is a profound and fundamental desire to approachGod, to connect with God, and to experience the oneg that such knowledge andconnection brings. The oneg experienced through true connection with theInfinite One is different from any earthly delight.SAYING GOODBYE TO THE SABBATH: A FOND AND FRAGRANT FAREWELLWhen the sun goes down on Friday evening, Shabbat begins. And when the sun goesdown on Saturday evening, Shabbat ends. Traditionally, the setting of the sunfollowed by the appearance of the first three stars in the sky marks theofficial end to Shabbat for the Kabbalist, but this is merely a guideline. ManyKabbalists, particularly in Hasidic communities, prefer that the Sabbathlingers; they’re in no rush to end the sweetness of the Sabbath and begin thebusy work week. Who could blame them?Just before the Sabbath ends, Kabbalists perform an ancient ritual known ashavdalah (hahv -dah-lah ). The term implies separation, and the ritual is aseparation between the seventh day and the work week that’s about to begin. Thehavdalah prayer that Kabbalists recite is as follows:Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid: for God theLord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation. Therefore with joyshall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. Salvation belongs unto theLord: thy blessing be upon thy people. The Lord of Hosts is with us; the God ofJacob is our refuge. (Lord of Hosts, praised is the man who trusts in you. Lordsave! May the King answer us on the day we call.) The Jews had light and joy andgladness and honor. So be it with us. I will lift the cup of salvation, and callupon the Name of the Lord.Kabbalists also light an intertwined candle and make some special blessingsappropriate to the moment. After all, the peace and tranquility of the Sabbathis about to end and the Kabbalist needs to jar himself or herself into anotherround of the week. Every standard Jewish prayer book contains the details of thehavdalah ritual.GEARING UP FOR THE SABBATH ALL OVER AGAINKabbalistic tradition teaches that the world is created through divineemanations known as sefirot (see Chapter 4). These fundamental building blocksof the universe and the human soul combine in a vast number of combinations andpermutations to result in the diversity of the universe. The ten sefirot areoften divided into the top three and the bottom seven. For Kabbalists, thebottom seven sefirot on the Kabbalistic chart correspond to the seven days ofthe week. This teaching implies that each of the days of the week has its ownnature and its own tendencies.THE RHYTHM OF THE WEEKThe Kabbalist views the week as a perpetual round that begins and ends on eachShabbat. When one Shabbat ends, the following six days become, in a sense, aladder that the Kabbalist climbs day by day to arrive once again at the nextholy Sabbath. The week has a Kabbalistic rhythm thanks to the seven sefirot,each of which corresponds to a day. Also contributing to the rhythm of the weekis the inner attitude of the Kabbalist, who brings his or her understanding ofthe day to its experience with the hope and prayer that the two will resonatewith each other.bullet [Images/check.png] Sunday, the Kabbalistic Day of Reaching Out: Thesefirah for Sunday is that of Chesed (kheh-sed), which signifies lovingkindness.Chesed is an expansive thrust, an expansion outward. It naturally correspondswith the first day of the week, Sunday, when the Kabbalist bids goodbye to thestillness of the Sabbath and ventures outward into the new week.bullet [Images/check.png] Monday, the Kabbalistic Day of Discipline: Mondaycorresponds to the sefirah of Gevurah (geh-voo-rah), which signifies strength,judgment, and discipline. It stands to reason that Gevurah is the sefirah forMonday because, by Monday, the worker who sets out on Sunday is fully in theflow of the week and is beginning to flex his muscle to accomplish what he setsout to accomplish.bullet [Images/check.png] Tuesday, the Kabbalistic Day of Harmony: The sefirahof Tuesday is Tiferet (tih-feh-ret), which signifies beauty and harmony. Itappears as the central sefirah on the chart of the sefirot, just as Tuesday endsthe first half of the week and ushers in Wednesday, which begins the secondhalf.bullet [Images/check.png] Wednesday, the Kabbalistic Day of Motivation: Thesefirah of Wednesday is Netzach (neh-tzakh). Netzach implies in the urge to getthings done. Wednesday, as the start of the second half of the week, is a day ofmotivation to complete the week successfully in anticipation of the arrival ofthe Sabbath.bullet [Images/check.png] Thursday, the Kabbalistic Day of Persistence: Thesefirah for Thursday is Hod (hoed), which reflects the abstract notion ofpersistence, bearing down, and holding on. With Friday night and the welcomingof the Sabbath bride in sight, Thursday carries the need for a rededication tofinish the tasks of the week by connecting into the spirit of Hod, mustering upone’s final energies in order for the week to be fulfilled. Thursday night is atime for an accounting of the soul; the Kabbalist looks at any issues of theweek and works for resolution or makes a plan for them to be worked on afterShabbat so that the soul and relationships can be more free and open on Shabbat.bullet [Images/check.png] Friday, the Kabbalistic Day of Connection: Friday isthe sefirah of Yesod (yeh-sowd), which reflects connecting and connection. Theconnection may be between teacher and student, parent and child, husband andwife, or lovers. It’s no surprise that, according to Kabbalah, a Friday eveningis the recommended time of the week for a husband and wife to make love,manifesting the spirit of the sefirah of Yesod, which also connects to the humangenitals.THE SABBATH: THE ULTIMATE RECEPTACLEFinally, the sefirah of the Sabbath is that of Malchut (mal-khoot; the kingdom).The Sabbath is the culmination of the week and the time to reap the rewards ofsix hard days of work. On the Sabbath, the Kabbalist sits with his or her familylike royalty — princes, kings, and queens. Thus, the Sabbath is more than a day;it’s an exalted and holy experience. And just as the kingdom is one wholeentity, the Sabbath, as the culmination of the week, completes the wholeness ofthe round of days for the Kabbalist."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11A YEAR IN THE LIFE OF A KABBALISTIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Starting out with Kabbalah’s New Yearbullet [Images/arrow.png] Focusing on introspection and spiritual mattersbullet [Images/arrow.png] Commemorating historical events in Jewish historybullet [Images/arrow.png] Taking time to reflect on the power and presence ofGodbullet [Images/arrow.png] Seeing the deeper meaning of birthdaysBeing a Kabbalist is a full-time job — not only every day and every week, butthroughout the year as well.

Ultimately, every day a Kabbalist is eithercelebrating a holiday or looking forward to the next one because the year of theKabbalist is filled with days of sanctification of all kinds.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The special holy days of Kabbalah are the same as the holy days on the Jewishcalendar.

But all share the constant awareness that God isthe center of all things and of all being.In this chapter, I share with you the important holy days Kabbalists (along withother Jews) observe throughout the year. I also include information on how tocelebrate your birthday like a Kabbalist.Warning(bomb) [Images/Warning(bomb).jpg]Each of the holy days in the Kabbalist’s year has seemingly countless details,including lots of customs and dos and don’ts. Unfortunately, it’s easy to getbogged down by these details and to be so distracted by them and so eager tofulfill them that one forgets the basic essences of the holy days.RINGING IN THE NEW YEAR WITHOUT A NOISEMAKERThe mood of the secular New Year that begins at midnight on December 31 isclearly visible on TV — surely you’ve noticed all the parties, noisemakers, andboisterous behavior. A Kabbalist welcomes the New Year with joy, but the mood isquite serious, not boisterous. The Kabbalist’s New Year, which appears in thefall, is called Rosh Hashanah (rowsh hah-shah -nah; the head of the year).But before Rosh Hashanah, Kabbalists participate in a month-long preparation toobserve the New Year. Each year, in the Hebrew month of Elul, a number ofcustoms are popular among Kabbalists.bullet [Images/check.png] One of the most moving customs is the blowing of theshofar (show-far; ram’s horn) each morning, usually in the synagogue. The soundof the ram’s horn is ancient and moving, and it tends to reinforce theintrospective and self-examining mood of the month.bullet [Images/check.png] In accordance with the teachings of the greatKabbalist, the Ari, Kabbalists fast on the first two days of the Hebrew month ofElul in order to prepare themselves for the serious introspection done duringthis month.bullet [Images/check.png] Kabbalists meditate on some of the names of God (inparticular the most holy name, the four-letter name of God).bullet [Images/check.png] In recent centuries, many Kabbalists celebrate the18th day of the month of Elul (12 days before Rosh Hashanah), which is thebirthday of the Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov, the founder of the Hasidic movement.bullet [Images/check.png] In the Hasidic world, it’s customary to visit one’sspiritual teacher during the month of Elul, even if it means traveling greatdistances.bullet [Images/check.png] Giving charity, while practiced throughout the year,is especially common among Kabbalists during the month of Elul.According to tradition, the New Year is the time that God looks into the Book ofLife and makes decisions for the coming year. So it isn’t surprising that themonth leading up to Rosh Hashanah is filled with serious examination of one’sdeeds in the past year as well as a resetting of priorities for the coming year.Kabbalists hope that God finds pleasure in this activity and is prompted toinscribe them for another year in the Book of Life.On Rosh Hashanah, Kabbalists participate in the following special customs andpractices:bullet [Images/check.png] Reciting the very first prayer service on the firstnight of Rosh Hashanah with particular intensity: Starting off the year’s firstprayer session with extra special inner intention is a fine spiritual launch ofthe new year.bullet [Images/check.png] Sharing a special New Year’s greeting, Shana tovaumetuka (shah-nah toe-vah oo-meh-too-kah; a good and sweet year) with othersbullet [Images/check.png] Crying tears of longing for closeness to God: Thegreat Kabbalist, Rabbi Isaac Luria taught that if a person doesn’t manage to cryat least a little on Rosh Hashanah or during the days after it, his or her soulmay be in need of extra introspection.The synagogue service for Rosh Hashanah is long and intense. The prayers ofintrospection and self-examination of one’s deeds and behavior dominate the holyday prayer book known as the Rosh Hashanah machzor (mahk -zoar). Essentially,the same set of prayers has been recited by Kabbalists for centuries, and themodern Rosh Hashanah machzor contains the precise prayers that Kabbalists haveused over this time.TESHUVAH IN THE NEW YEARIn the secular world, people welcome and celebrate the New Year with parties.Kabbalists mark the arrival of the New Year with intense prayer and study. Forcenturies, Kabbalists have spent extra time throughout the month of Elul leadingup to Rosh Hashanah studying and praying. This study usually centers on theprofound concept of teshuvah (teh-shoo -vah).The word “teshuvah” has a number of meanings. One is “turning,” which impliesthat the activity of teshuvah is an inward, spiritual process whereby theKabbalist turns his attention to the proper focal point of all existence, theDivine. Teshuvah in this sense is a realignment of one’s priorities away fromthe distractions of the world. Teshuvah also means “a response” because of thehope that God will respond positively to one’s introspection and efforts to dogood deeds and think holy thoughts. Teshuvah is often translated as“repentance,” but unfortunately that term has negative connotations. Althoughteshuvah certainly contains a sense of contrition and regret, the great sagesurged their students to be less preoccupied with regret and more preoccupiedwith turning and setting their sights on a higher level.IMPORTANT BOOKS TO CHECK OUTThe following two books — one classic and one modern — are important tools forKabbalists during the month of Elul, the month before Rosh Hashanah:bullet [Images/check.png] Shaarei Teshuvah: This classic text translates to TheGates of Repentance. It was written by Rabbeinu Yonah Gerondi in the 13thcentury and has been studied by countless Kabbalists since.bullet [Images/check.png] Teshuvah: This modern classic was written by RabbiAdin Steinsaltz, who’s known throughout the world as a master of Kabbalah. It’sa detailed guidebook for the modern individual who wants to understand theintricacies of the process of change. The book is written for beginner as wellas advanced students and isn’t bogged down with technical terminology.TEN DAYS IN THE EARLY FALL FOR INTROSPECTION AND TURNINGThe ten days between Rosh Hashanah and the next significant holiday on theKabbalist’s calendar, Yom Kippur (yohm kee-poor ), are days of particularintensity. Kabbalists spend time every day of the year examining their deeds andare preoccupied with these things during the month before Rosh Hashanah, but theten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are the most intense of all.These days are often referred to as The Days of Awe. Kabbalists use these tendays to peer as keenly as possible into their hearts and minds, taking inventoryof their past deeds and character traits. The ten days leading up to Yom Kippurshouldn’t be dominated by fear or concern that one has made too many errors inone’s life or has sunk to a low place spiritually or ethically. Rather, for theKabbalist, they’re days of increased hope that one is being successful in theprocess of introspection and that, on the day of judgment, Yom Kippur, one’sprayers will be answered and God will look favorably upon all the efforts thathave been made up until that point.THE DAY OF “AT-ONE-MENT”Yom Kippur is certainly the most intense day of the year for the Kabbalist; it’sdominated by prayer and marked by fasting for over 24 hours. In addition, theKabbalist doesn’t bathe and attempts to avoid all preoccupation with worldlymatters during Yom Kippur. Yom Kippur is primarily a spiritual day.Kabbalists give charity just before Yom Kippur because they believe that themerit of charity is protection against evil decrees. Kabbalists also believethat the sounds of the coins of charity given before the afternoon meal on YomKippur (after which the Yom Kippur fast begins) creates such a significant soundin heaven that the forces of impurity make way for the prayers recited duringthe holy day.In many synagogues that aren’t dominated by a Kabbalistic spirit, the day of YomKippur is a somber one. But in synagogues that are nourished by Kabbalistictradition, the mood isn’t somber at all. On the contrary, when one enters such asynagogue on Yom Kippur, one thing that’s striking is that everyone is dressedin white, a symbol of purity and purification. Wearing white reflects the beliefthat God hears one’s prayers, acknowledges one’s sincere regrets, and acceptsone with love and enthusiasm.The great Kabbalistic master, the Baal Shem Tov, asked, “How can we ever thinkthat we can pray on Rosh Hashanah and change God’s mind or inspire God to grantour requests?” He suggested that each person receives blessings from God andthat his or her sins can cause those blessings to stop. But when Kabbalistspray, they change themselves, not God. And then, when they change themselves, anew decree comes from heaven that once again opens up the channels of blessings.Through sincere prayer, a person can even become a different person in the eyesof heaven, prompting a shower of abundant blessings.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Yom Kippur isn’t a day when a Kabbalist worries about whether God will accepthis prayers. For the Kabbalist, Yom Kippur is a day of confidence, a day thatconcludes the intense month of Elul (see “Ringing in the New Year without aNoisemaker” earlier in this chapter for more) and the intense ten days betweenRosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur (see “Ten Days in the Early Fall for Introspectionand Turning” earlier in this chapter).ACKNOWLEDGING WITH JOY THAT LIFE IS TEMPORARYIn the fall, Kabbalists celebrate an seven-day holiday known as Sukkot (sue-coat). The word “sukkot” is the plural of the word sukkah (sue-kah; booth), which isa direct reference to temporary dwelling places (or small huts) that arereferred to in the Torah (see Figure 11-1 for an illustration of a sukkah).WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]Verses in the Torah describing Sukkot read:And you shall keep it a feast to the Lord seven days in the year. It shall be astatute forever in your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventhmonth.You shall dwell in booths seven days; all who are Israelites born shall dwell inbooths;That your generations may know that I made the people of Israel to dwell inbooths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; I am the Lord your God.—Leviticus 23:41–43Figure 11-1: The sukkah is an essential component of the holiday Sukkot.Figure 11-1: The sukkah is an essential component of the holiday Sukkot.[Images/915904 fg1101.jpg]The central story that Kabbalists study during Sukkot is that of the Children ofIsrael’s Exodus from Egypt and dwelling in the desert for 40 years until theyreached the Holy Land, the Promised Land. In an effort to simulate theirexperience, the Torah commands that temporary dwellings be created, and forcenturies Kabbalists have spent time building temporary huts and dwelling inthem during the seven days of Sukkot. By eating in these huts, studying holybooks in these huts, and even sleeping in them, Kabbalists symbolicallyparticipate in living as the Children of Israel did in temporary huts in thedesert. One of the central ideas of the Sukkot holy days is the notion thathuman life is fleeting. By living in a temporary dwelling, Kabbalists get thesense that life is fragile and that each day is a blessing.One of the rituals performed each day during the holy days of Sukkot involvesholding four specific species of vegetation in one’s hands and lifting them inall six directions: east, west, north, south, up, and down. These six directionsreflect the Kabbalist’s belief that God is everywhere and that there’s no placewhere God is not.Kabbalists observe a custom known as ushpizen (oo -shpee-zen; guests) in thesukkah each of the seven days because the Zohar teaches that each of the sevenshepherds of the Jewish people visits the sukkah on a different night and leadsthe group of visitors. The traditional Jewish prayer book provides a format forwelcoming these seven guests. All the people in the sukkah greet the guests outloud with traditional words of welcome. Each of the shepherds is symbolic of oneof the seven lower sefirot (see Chapter 4). Table 11-1 matches the days ofSukkot with the appropriate shepherds and sefirot.Table 11-1 The Seven Shepherds of Sukkot Day of Sukkot Shepherd of the JewishPeople Corresponding Sefirah 1 Abraham Chesed 2 Isaac Gevurah 3 Jacob Tiferet 4Moses Netzach 5 Aaron Hod 6 Joseph Yesod 7 David MalchutAnother name for the holy days of Sukkot is z’man simchataynu (dzi-mahnsim-khah-tay -new; the season of our joy). Sukkot is supposed to be a happy andjoyful time historically connected to the harvest period, when all the wonderfulgrowth from the summer months is ready for harvesting; the appreciation of theharvest’s abundance, the joy that’s spoken about on Sukkot, is a spiritual joy.When Kabbalists look back on the intense period from the month of Elul to YomKippur, they know that they’ve begun a new year with gratitude for the life andgifts that God provides.The day after Sukkot is a holy day known as Simchat Torah (sim -khat toe -rah;the joy of the Torah). On this day, Kabbalists literally dance with the Torahscroll as the yearly round of the public reading of the Torah ends and beginsagain. It’s a holiday marked by great joy, dancing, singing, and celebration.MEDITATING ON LIGHT FOR EIGHT DAYSMany people think that the Jewish holiday of Chanukah (chah -new-kah) is theJewish Christmas. This misconception isn’t so surprising considering that thetwo holidays often coincide on the calendar. In reality, though, Chanukah is aneight-day holiday that commemorates an historic event in the history of theJewish people. The event is the ancient Jews’ victory in their struggle againstbeing swallowed up culturally and spiritually by the Greek culture around them.A CANDLE-LIGHTING CONTROVERSY (NO, I’M NOT KIDDING)Kabbalists throughout the ages have dealt with an interesting and ancientdispute pertaining to the lighting of the Chanukah menorah. The Chanukah menorahconsists of eight candles, or eight flames, each representing a day. The eightflames come from a miracle that occurred in ancient times having to do with oiland its use in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. The Jews found their Templedesecrated after achieving victory over their enemy, and they saw that there wasonly one measure of oil suitable for lighting. The oil was only enough to lastfor a single day. The miracle, as recorded and passed down through thegenerations, is that the oil that was sufficient only for one day actuallylasted eight days. Therefore, those who observe the holy days of Chanukah lighta candle each day for eight days.Here’s where the controversy comes in. Two illustrious sages named Hillel andShammai had a dispute regarding the proper way to light the flames on each nightof Chanukah.bullet [Images/check.png] Shammai believed that eight candles should be lit onthe first day of Chanukah, seven should be lit on the second day, six should belit on the third day, and so forth until the 8th day, when one candle should belit.bullet [Images/check.png] Hillel argued that one candle should be lit on thefirst day of Chanukah, two candles on the second day, three candles on the thirdday, and so on until the 8th day, when all eight candles would be burning.Hillel’s position won out based on the argument that the light should increaseand not decrease. After all, that’s what one’s task in life is all about —increasing the light in the world, specifically the divine light. Symbolically,an increase of light, with one candle being added each day throughout the eightdays of Chanukah, more accurately reflects the spirit of the holy day and theKabbalist’s intention to add light to the world.The well-known Chanukah activity is the lighting of candles (for more on thiscustom, see the sidebar “A candle-lighting controversy (No, I’m not kidding).”Among Kabbalists, this lighting of candles is the central activity of these holydays. Yet even more important than the lighting of the candles is the period oftime immediately after they’re lit each evening, when Kabbalists meditate on thelight from the Chanukah flames.The menorah (meh-no -rah; candelabra) that’s lit during Chanukah (see Figure11-2) is rich with symbolism and has been the subject of much discussion inKabbalistic texts. The original menorah was a seven-branch candelabra that stoodin the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, and Kabbalists associate each of the sevenlights on their own menorahs with each of the seven lower sefirot. Lighting thecandles of Chanukah one by one is an opportunity for Kabbalists to focus on themeaning of the sefirot.Because of the association of Chanukah with Christmas, giving gifts to childrenafter lighting the Chanukah candles is common among Jews. But gift-giving isn’ta traditional part of Chanukah, and it certainly isn’t customary amongKabbalists.Figure 11-2: A Chanukah menorah.Figure 11-2: A Chanukah menorah. [Images/915904 fg1102.jpg]SEEING GOD IN EVERYTHINGOne of the most intriguing holy days on the Kabbalah calendar, Purim (poor -eem;lottery or lots), is one that doesn’t appear in the Five Books of Moses andoriginally commemorated an historic event. The story of the event is told insome detail in one of the books of the Holy Scriptures, the book of Esther.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalists consider the holy day of Purim to be an historic commemoration of amiracle. When reading the book of Esther, it appears from the story that theJewish people were in bitter trouble with no way out. But the story takes aradical turn, and the Jewish people emerge victorious. It isn’t a stretch tocall this event a miracle, but Kabbalists throughout the centuries have pointedout that the miracle isn’t just the major turning point in the story; rather, ina real way, every moment of life is miraculous, from the most mundane to themost spectacular.CELEBRATING THE BOOK OF ESTHEROn the surface, the book of Esther is a story of victory over anti-Semitism. Thewicked king of Persia, King Ahasuerus, held a beauty contest in order to selecta wife. All the women from the kingdom came and presented themselves forinspection and evaluation. The victor was Esther, a young Jewish woman whoeventually became Queen Esther, King Ahasuerus’ wife.According to the story, the chancellor in the kingdom, a wicked man named Haman,concocted a plot that would have resulted in King Ahasuerus authorizing thekilling of the Jews in Persia. Queen Esther’s cousin, Mordecai, got involved andhelped the king recognize Haman for the evil man that he was. Haman was hanged,and Mordecai was offered an important leadership position within the king’sregime. All of this is considered to be a miracle.For centuries, Jews (including Kabbalists) have celebrated the holy day of Purimwith many interesting customs. Adults and children dress up in costumes, and themild drinking of alcoholic beverages — not to get drunk but to get a littlejoyful buzz — is encouraged. These customs are a part of the joyous mood ofvictory as described in the book of Esther.To outsiders, Purim looks something like Halloween because in Jewishneighborhoods, children go door-to-door wearing interesting and often humorouscostumes. One profound difference between Halloween and Purim, though, is thaton Halloween children go door-to-door asking for gifts, and on Purim one of thespiritual requirements is to go door-to-door (or at least to seek out friendsand neighbors) and give gifts.Purim is a time of giving and gratitude. This custom comes from the book ofEsther when Mordecai declared the holiday of Purim as a time “of feasting andgladness and of sending food to one another, as well as gifts to the poor.”INCLUDING GOD IN EVERYTHING — WITHOUT MENTIONING GOD AT ALLPerhaps the most profound aspect of Purim, however, is clear upon a closeexamination of the biblical book of Esther. Of the many books that make up theBible, only the book of Esther has a unique characteristic: God’s name isn’tmentioned in the book even once. It’s hard to believe that there could possiblybe a page in the Bible, let alone an entire book, that doesn’t have a singlemention of God. It seems unbelievable, but it’s true.The great sages throughout the centuries drew this profound conclusion from theabsence of God’s name: God is so present in every detail of life that theabsence of his name doesn’t indicate his absence but rather his presence. In asense, it would be impossible to mention God at every single moment of thestory, so rather than His name appearing constantly, it doesn’t appear at all.The message is clear and reflects a pivotal idea at the heart of Kabbalah:Nothing happens in the world without God allowing it to happen. Not a blade ofgrass moving, not a leaf falling from a tree, not a single event large or smallis outside the influence of God.The great master of Kabbalah, the Vilna Gaon, pointed out that the word “Purim”shares the same letters as “Yom HaKippurim,” which is the biblical name for YomKippur. He taught that Yom Kippur is essentially a spiritual holy day filledwith great introspection and intense prayer, whereas Purim is largely a physicalholy day rooted in history, with customs that are quite physical in nature. TheVilna Gaon said that these two holy days are actually two sides of the samecoin. Just as humans have two sides, physical and spiritual, these two holy dayscomprise the physical and the spiritual.Also, the word “pur” means lottery, implying that a person’s fate is beyond himor her and is in the hands of God. On Yom Kippur, God makes a final decree abouteach person’s fate for the coming year, and on Purim, the story in the book ofEsther reminds Kabbalists that God is behind all events.On the holy day of Purim, Kabbalists participate in the following activities:bullet [Images/check.png] Hearing a public reading of the book of Esther in theevening of the holy day and then again during the following day.bullet [Images/check.png] Celebrating a festive meal during the day with foodand wine or other spirits. The Talmud and the Code of Jewish Law giveinstruction to drink until we can no longer differentiate between “Blessed isMordecai” and “Cursed is Haman.” Mordecai is the hero of the book of Esther, andHaman is the villain. This custom serves to emphasize the celebration at thevictory of the Jews over its enemies.bullet [Images/check.png] Giving charity to at least two people in need.bullet [Images/check.png] Delivering or sending a gift of two or more kinds offoods or drink to a minimum of one friend.LIBERATING ONESELF FROM NARROWNESSA popular series of holy days on the Jewish calendar is Passover. Many laws andcustoms guide Jews through the celebration of this eight-day holiday. On thefirst two days, families sit down to a festive meal known as a Passover seder(say -der); during the meal, members of the family and other participants readfrom an ancient book known as the Haggadah (hah-gah -dah). The Haggadah tellsthe story of the slavery experience of the Children of Israel during their timein ancient Egypt as well as the subsequent exodus from Egypt, when God, throughhis messenger Moses, led the Children of Israel to Liberation.Many Kabbalistic customs are part of the Passover seder. In fact, it’s probablytrue that most Jews who celebrate Passover and sit down to a Passover sederaren’t even aware of the Kabbalistic origins of the customs. For example, theseder plate features various food symbols meant to remind people of details fromthe Exodus story. Unbeknownst to most, customs concerning the way in which thesesymbols are placed on the seder plate have been handed down throughout thegenerations by the great Kabbalists.Perhaps the major theme of Passover, and one that Kabbalists focus on throughoutthe eight days of the holy season, is reflected in the Hebrew word for “Egypt,”Mitzrayim (mitz-rah -yeem). Etymologically, the word for “Egypt” is almostidentical to the word for the phrase “narrow place.” People often findthemselves in narrow places, not so much physically as psychologically andspiritually. The spirit of Passover is meant to inspire people to break free, tobe liberated, and to reach higher.Many commentaries explain the Kabbalistic significance of each of the detailsand rituals performed at Passover. For example, one part of the seder recountsthe ten plagues that God inflicted on the ancient Egyptians. In the writings ofthe great Kabbalist, Rabbi Isaac Luria (see Chapter 18), the ten plaguescorrespond to the ten sefirot. The connection is quite esoteric and is explainedthrough the use of the numerical values of the letters of each of the plagues.It’s a good example of Kabbalistic details far beyond the grasp of a novice.Another example of a Passover practice with Kabbalistic significance is bedikatchometz (beh-dee -khat khum -atz; search for leaven). The day before Passover,ten small pieces of bread or other food that’s forbidden to be eaten on Passoveris gathered and prepared to be discarded in preparation for the holy days. ForKabbalists, these ten pieces bring to mind the ten sefirot. Each sefirah haspositive aspects and negative aspects, which participants symbolically discardwith the bread or other forbidden food.A 49-DAY KABBALISTIC MEDITATION ON THE ASCENT TO GODThe spiritual calendar observed by Kabbalists throughout the centuries has a49-day period between Passover and Shavuot (shah-voo-oat; weeks), the next holyday on the Jewish calendar. Whereas Passover is the commemoration of theliberation of the Children of Israel from slavery in Egypt, Shavuot is thecelebration of God giving the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai.The 49-day period between Passover and Shavuot is know as sefirat haomer(seh-fee -rat hah-oh -mare). Although the entire year is filled withopportunities to focus on the deep ideas in Kabbalistic tradition, these 49 daysoffer the Kabbalist an opportunity to focus intensely on the ten sefirot and, inparticular, their meaning in one’s life.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalistic tradition urges one to look with particular care at the seven lowersefirot on the chart of the ten sefirot (refer to Chapter 4) and to recognizethat each of the seven lower sefirot is a fundamental human emotion thatcomprises human experience. Each of the seven weeks between Passover and Shavuotis dedicated to one of these seven, as follows:bullet [Images/check.png] Week 1: Chesedbullet [Images/check.png] Week 2: Gevurahbullet [Images/check.png] Week 3: Tiferetbullet [Images/check.png] Week 4: Netzachbullet [Images/check.png] Week 5: Hodbullet [Images/check.png] Week 6: Yesodbullet [Images/check.png] Week 7: MalchutAfter the seven weeks are over, Kabbalists symbolically arrive at Mount Sinaiand are prepared to receive the Torah. A deeper understanding of each of thesefirot includes the notion that each sefirah has within it every other sefirah.For example, Week 1 focuses on the sefirah of Chesed, which is often translatedas lovingkindness and has a sense of expansiveness. Week 1 proceeds as follows:bullet [Images/check.png] Day 1: The Chesed of Chesed. The sefirah of Chesed,lovingkindness, has a loving aspect to it.bullet [Images/check.png] Day 2: The Gevurah of Chesed. One of the many aspectsof lovingkindness is discipline. Love that has no restraints and no boundariescan be dangerous and unhealthy.bullet [Images/check.png] Day 3: The Tiferet of Chesed. Tiferet is the sefirahof harmony and beauty. There’s a beautiful aspect to kindness, such as thekindness offered to people one meets during the day. For example, when aKabbalist goes into a shop, she doesn’t simply make a transaction and leave. Sheoffers some affection, warmth, and friendliness to the shopkeeper, using wordslike “please” and “thank you” as well as making eye contact and smiling.An ancient Kabbalah text requires Kabbalists to greet people with a smile. Thisisn’t just friendly advice on the part of the sage from centuries ago; it’s partof the law.bullet [Images/check.png] Day 4: The Netzach of Chesed. Netzach, which can bedescribed as the urge to get things done, reflects the aspect of love thatendures and isn’t short-lived.bullet [Images/check.png] Day 5: The Hod of Chesed. Hod represents bearing downand sticking it out, surely an important aspect within a love relationship.Sometimes a love relationship encounters rocky waters, and that’s whenpersistence and holding on is necessary.bullet [Images/check.png] Day 6: The Yesod of Chesed. In order for love to becomplete between two people, there needs to be a profound emotional and intimateconnection that nourishes both people.bullet [Images/check.png] Day 7: The Malchut of Chesed. Malchut, which is thesummation of all things and the physical manifestation of life, makes sure thatlove isn’t just abstract and intangible but is real in the world.This list contains extremely brief explanations of the sefirot within thesefirot. For more detailed information, check out Chapter 4.Each week of sefirat haomer focuses on a different sefirah, and each day’s focusdiffers as well, as shown in the preceding example. Kabbalists who participatein this activity year after year have created a number of books and Web sites toshare their personal meditations on the combinations of sefirot. Each person hashis or her own slant and perspective on both the sefirot themselves and thecombinations of sefirot.In accordance with the Torah, Kabbalists count each of the 49 days betweenPassover and Shavuot. This period is known as the Counting of the Omer. An omeris a unit of measure. On the second day of Passover, in the days of the Temple,an omer of barley was cut down and brought to the Temple as an offering. Thisgrain offering was referred to as the Omer.From the second night of Passover to the night before Shavuot, Kabbalists recitea blessing every night. For example, of the 10th day, one would say, “Today isten days, which is one week and three days of the Omer.” The counting connectsPassover, which commemorates the Exodus, and Shavuot, which commemorates thegiving of the Torah, and the counting reminds Kabbalists that the redemptionfrom slavery wasn’t complete until the Torah was received.In the middle of the 49 days of the Counting of the Omer is a day that’s ofparticular interest to Kabbalists. It’s is known as Lag B’Omer (lahg beh-oh-mare; the 33rd day of the Omer). Lag B’Omer celebrates the great Kabbalist andauthor of the Zohar, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. Although Lag B’Omer is theanniversary of his death, he specifically requested that the day be celebratedwith joy.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]An entire book could be written on the seven sefirot and the seven aspects ofeach one, and in fact, such books have been written. In the final analysis,however, it’s up to each Kabbalist to do the inner work necessary to prepare andrefine oneself to be able to receive the Torah.RECEIVING GOD’S TEACHINGS CONSTANTLYAs I mention in the preceding section, Shavuot is the Jewish holy daycommemorating the historic events of God giving the Torah at Mount Sinai and theChildren of Israel receiving the Torah. However, Kabbalists see anotherdimension of this holy day and its message: They believe and act as thoughthey’re always standing at Mount Sinai and always receiving the Torah. One cansay that although the Torah was given at a certain moment in time many centuriesago, God is, in fact, constantly giving the Torah to the world, and at any timeone can stand at Mount Sinai and receive it.Kabbalists believe that suitable preparation is necessary in order to receivethe Torah. The Torah is available for everyone, but intense preparation isnecessary in order to receive the Torah more fully. Kabbalists must be ready atall times to receive the Torah from God, and in a sense, all the spiritualactivities of the Kabbalist are nothing other than preparation to connect withGod on higher and higher levels.After the seven intense weeks of introspection, self-examination, prayer, andstudy between Passover and Shavuot (see the preceding section), the Kabbalist isready to receive the Torah from God. The holy day of Shavuot offers a forum forthat receiving of the Torah, although as I explain in this chapter, forKabbalists the Torah is constantly being given and constantly being received inone’s mind and heart. One of the customs observed on Shavuot is the reading ofthe book of Ruth publicly in the synagogue.I DIDN’T SLEEP AT ALL LAST NIGHTAn ancient legend records that the morning of the day the Torah was given atMount Sinai, the Jews overslept. To wake them, a ram’s horn sounded, thunderrumbled, and lightning flashed. In the 16th century, the Kabbalists of Tzfatcreated the custom of staying up all night and studying from the various booksof Torah and reading the portion of the Five Books of Moses, which tells of thegiving of the Ten Commandments. This custom is called Tikkun Leil Shavuot(tee-koon leh-eel shah-voo-oat; repairing the eve of Shavuot). Rooted inKabbalistic tradition, this custom is still practiced and is quite popular. SomeKabbalists study a small portion of each of the books of the Bible as a way offulfilling this custom, and others choose to read various suitable texts of aspiritual nature. In general, Kabbalists love Torah study and never tire of thisactivity.MOURNING THE LOSS OF WHOLENESSJews observe Tisha B’Av (tish -ah bah-ahv ), a memorial to the destruction ofthe Holy Temple in Jerusalem, on the 9th day of the month of Av in the Hebrewcalendar, which corresponds to the month of July or August on the secularcalendar. This day commemorates a number of national calamities for the Jewishpeople, including:bullet [Images/check.png] The destruction of the First and Second Temples inJerusalembullet [Images/check.png] The fall of Bar Kochba’s fortressbullet [Images/check.png] The expulsion of the Jews of Spain in 1492On Tisha B’Av, Kabbalists read the biblical book of Lamentations along withother dirges. Because it’s a day of mourning, Kabbalists refrain from eating,cutting their hair, and wearing nice clothing on this day. In the synagogue,Kabbalists sit on low stools or on the ground as a sign of mourning. In a realway, Kabbalists put all their sorrows into this bitterly sad day; this day ofmourning signifies internal strife within the Jewish community.With regard to Tisha B’Av, the Talmud asks the question “Why was the Temple inJerusalem destroyed?” The answer’s given in the following story, which recountsthe events leading up to the Roman conquest of Jerusalem. A man had a friendwhose name was Kamza and an enemy named Bar-Kamza. The man held a big banquetthat was attended by many rabbis and sent an invitation to his friend Kamza. Bymistake, the invitation went out to Bar-Kamza. When the man who sponsored thebanquet saw Bar-Kamza at the meal, he demanded that his enemy leave. Bar-Kamzabegged to be allowed to stay and even offered to pay the entire cost of thefeast. The host insisted that Bar-Kamza leave and then threw him out. Hurt andangry that the rabbis at the banquet had kept silent, Bar Kamza decided toslander them to the Roman Emperor. He brought the Emperor false evidenceindicating that the Jews were rebelling against him, which led to the Romanconquest of Jerusalem.This passage from the Talmud indicates that the primary source of human troublescomes from human failures, particularly the baseless hatred that people oftendisplay toward others in the form of prejudice, gossip, backbiting, and so on.Kabbalists believe that the divine presence is absent when people display suchnegative activities and emotions.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The goal of the Kabbalist is to repair the world, to repair individualrelationships, and to repair and refine personality traits to result in thereturn of the divine presence (see Chapter 7). Kabbalists believe that whenthey’re worthy, the divine presence lives with them. This connection to God andinvitation for God to dwell within oneself is said to be the primary goal of allKabbalistic tradition.CELEBRATING BIRTHDAYS KABBALISTICLYTraditionally, Kabbalists put more emphasis on an anniversary of death than ananniversary of birth. After all, as I explain in Chapter 7, they view death as aday of graduation, not a tragedy. The Angel of Death arrives and separates thebody from the soul, and survivors put the body in the ground while the soul goeson to continue its work, either being reincarnated into the body of anotherperson or waiting for the perfection of the world.In a sense, a death is considered to be a spiritual victory for the individual.Those left behind feel sadness and sorrow because they miss the individual, butfor the soul that leaves his or her body and continues on its way, the moment ofdeath is commemorated.This attitude is reflected in the ancient literature studied by the Kabbalists.There’s a teaching, for example, that rather than celebrate a birth, we shouldcelebrate a death in the same way that a ship returning home to port iscelebrated. After all, when the ship takes off on its journey, no one knows ifthat journey will be a safe, peaceful, and productive one. But when the shipreturns to its port after experiencing a successful journey, it’s time forcelebration. This teaching, which appears in the Midrash, is a perfect analogyfor the Kabbalistic attitude towards death.Nevertheless, particularly in recent times, many Kabbalists celebrate birthdayswith at least as much fervor as they do deaths.One of the greatest Kabbalistic teachers of modern times was Rabbi MenachemMendel Schneerson, who was clearly one of the major teachers within the Jewishworld in general and Kabbalah in particular. Rabbi Schneerson, who was the headof a group of Hasidic Jews known as Lubavitch and therefore was known frequentlyas the Lubavitcher Rebbe, frequently spoke about the importance of eachindividual celebrating his or her birth. He taught that a birthday is theanniversary of the day that God sent a soul into the world. This anniversary isindeed an auspicious occasion, and the Lubavitcher Rebbe urged Kabbalists toacknowledge the day with gratitude to God for providing one with anotheropportunity to live life.The Lubavitcher Rebbe also urged his followers and people everywhere to use theanniversaries of their births as occasions to rededicate themselves to increasedTorah study and increased deeds of lovingkindness and charity. He also urgedstudents to take on additional projects or spiritual obligations on theanniversaries of their births.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]A birthday isn’t a day for surprise parties and the receiving of gifts. Rather,for some Kabbalists, celebrating the anniversary of a birth is theacknowledgment that the center of all being is God and that God creates,supports, and sustains his people throughout their gifts of life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12A KABBALIST’S LIFE CYCLEIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Marking the milestone of birthbullet [Images/arrow.png] Facing the changes associated with becoming an adultbullet [Images/arrow.png] Understanding Kabbalah’s take on marriage and therelationship between spousesbullet [Images/arrow.png] Honoring death and the customs of mourningThe Kabbalistic lifestyle begins even before birth and continues throughoutone’s life to the last breath and beyond.From birth through adolescence, to marriage and then death, the Kabbalist usestraditional and time-honored customs to reinforce his or her beliefs, alwayskeeping in mind that the center of all existence is God, that one’s primaryrelationship is the relationship to God, and that whereas the body is temporary,the soul is eternal.In this chapter, I walk you through the Kabbalist’s life cycle, explaining allthe key customs and celebrations along the way.BEGINNING WITH A BANG: BIRTHAccording to Kabbalistic tradition, three partners come together to create anewborn child: the mother, the father, and God. Kabbalists believe that a birthintroduces a soul into the world through its vehicle, the body. For some souls,birth is the first time the soul is in the world. But according to Kabbalistictradition, the souls of most people have been here before.GREETING THE NEWBORNOn the occasion of a birth, Kabbalists participate in a special celebrationcalled shalom zachor (shah -lowm zah- khar; peace little boy). The celebrationusually occurs on the first Shabbat (shah-bot; Sabbath) after a birth. (For moreon Shabbat, flip to Chapter 10.) Traditionally, shalom zachor is held on theoccasion of the birth of a boy.As a matter of principle, a girl’s soul is on a higher spiritual level than aboy’s soul. The Talmud teaches that a girl is born with more of the sefirah ofBinah (see Chapter 4), which is understanding and the ability to analyze. Oneexplanation offered for why a newborn boy gets a shalom zachor and a newborngirl does not is that the boy needs more help than the girl. Instead of a shalomzachor, it’s customary to publicly announce the name of the newborn girl infront of an open Torah scroll in the synagogue. On the occasion of a girl’snaming, words of Torah (known as divrei Torah) are also shared to honor themoment.The idea behind shalom zachor, which often occurs in either a synagogue or inone’s home, is twofold:bullet [Images/check.png] It’s simply a celebration. For a husband and wife, thebirth of a baby is a profoundly joyous occasion that calls for celebration.bullet [Images/check.png] It’s a way of recognizing the fact that the soul thathas just entered the world is going to confront many trials and tribulations.Before birth, a soul is in heaven, standing before God and basking in divinelight. But when a soul is put into a body and sent into the world, it’s nolonger in the blissful state of God’s presence. Rather, the soul has a body thatgets hungry, cold, hot, tired, and so on. Life presents all kinds of challenges,so when Kabbalists greet a new baby boy, they wish the baby peace, and they hopethat his life will be smooth and joyful.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The most important elements in a shalom zachor celebration arebullet [Images/check.png] Joybullet [Images/check.png] Delicious food and drinkbullet [Images/check.png] Spiritual songsbullet [Images/check.png] Ecstatic dancingbullet [Images/check.png] Words of TorahWith regards to the last element in the list, it’s traditional at a shalomzachor celebration for at least one person (if not many) to offer what are knownas divrei Torah (div -rey toe -rah; words of Torah). A devar Torah (deh-var toe-rah; the singular form) is the sharing of an inspirational message that’sconnected to the Torah and uplifting. Kabbalists wouldn’t dream of celebrating ashalom zachor on the occasion of a birth without sharing some words ofinspiration with the others who are present.GETTING A TAP ON THE MOUTH FROM AN ANGELKabbalists believe that every detail of the human body is divine revelation. Inother words, Kabbalistic tradition urges the Kabbalist to look closely at thebody as a microcosm of the universe. The fact that humans have ten fingers, twoarms, earlobes, hair, toes, and every other part of the body prompts theKabbalist to search for rich meanings that the body parts, in all their detail,suggest.An ancient text known and studied by Kabbalists refers to an interesting part ofthe body, the filtrum, the notch between the upper lip and nose. This ancienttext asks the question “What is the divine revelation and significance of thefiltrum?”The sages suggest that, on the occasion of the baby’s birth, an angel taps thebaby on the month in an effort to jolt it out of paradise and into the world.That tap creates the filtrum. But the text goes on to offer another interestingand powerful insight: The angel’s tap on the baby’s mouth also causes the soulto forget all the Torah it has learned.The idea behind this theory is that the soul absorbs God’s wisdom, the Torah,when the soul is in God’s presence before birth. But the angel’s tap on themouth not only jolts the baby into a new dimension (the world) but also joltsthe baby into forgetting all the wisdom it absorbed from God. Kabbalistsconclude that when a person learns things throughout his or her life, thelearning isn’t really an act of acquiring new information as much as it’s an actof remembering what’s already known.Kabbalists also believe that each person embodies a tremendous amount ofprofound wisdom acquired from each incarnation. So even though a baby is bornseemingly ignorant, in fact, it has learned a tremendous amount throughout itsprevious incarnations, and the child proceeds to recognize and remember thingsthroughout its life.NAMING THE BABY — IT’S NO MINOR FEATKabbalists believe in a phenomenon called ruach hakodesh (roo -akh hah-koe-desh; holy spirit). According to Kabbalah, it’s possible for a divine spirit, amessage from God, to speak through a person.Sometimes the spirit from God that speaks through an individual results in anentire book. The great 16th-century Kabbalist Joseph Karo, for example, is saidto have participated in what today is called automatic writing or channeling.The channeler goes into a trance but remains active during the trance, even tothe extent of being able to write a book while in the trance. Rabbi Joseph Karoclaimed that some of his writings weren’t really written by him but ratherthrough him, and other great rabbis at the time made supporting observations.One of the great libraries in the Jewish world, the library of the JewishTheological Seminary, has in its collection some rare manuscripts that are saidto be the result of Rabbi Joseph Karo’s ruach hakodesh.What does all this mean for modern-day parents? Kabbalistic tradition teachesthat when parents have a child and participate in a discussion of what to namethe baby, unbeknownst to them, their strongest ideas of what to name the childaren’t really independent thoughts. Rather, ruach hakodesh comes down from abovewith a message from God regarding the baby’s name.Parents don’t experience lightning and thunder or hear voices; they simplyexperience natural thought processes. Kabbalists believe that these thoughtprocesses come from a higher source and prompt the decisions that parents makeregarding a baby’s name.THE IMPORTANCE OF LISTENING TO INTUITIONWarning(bomb) [Images/Warning(bomb).jpg]Kabbalists believe that sometimes parents resist their natural inclinationsregarding a baby’s name, which results in the baby having the “wrong” name. Ifparents give a child the “wrong” name, one of the important tasks in life is tofind one’s real name and rename oneself. Many people dislike their names; thisdislike, according to Kabbalah, isn’t merely an issue of personal taste. Rather,the person carrying around a name that he or she shouldn’t have experiencesdiscomfort and often a deep inner desire to change the name and acquire theright one.RENAMING A SICK BABYOne aspect of baby-naming for the Kabbalist is renaming. When an infant or evenan older child is suffering from an illness, the parents may bring that child toa synagogue and rename the baby in front of an open Torah scroll. Oneexplanation for this custom is that it’s an attempt to fool the Angel of Death.Imagine that the Angel of Death has been given an assignment to bring about thegentle death of an individual on earth. The assumption is that the Angel ofDeath searching for the seriously ill individual becomes confused when a childis renamed. The Angel of Death is looking for a soul with one particular nameand finds that individual with a new name. Causing this disorientation isthought to be a curative effort.COMING OF AGE KABBALISTICALLYThe first significant life cycle moment for an individual is his or her birth;the second is puberty. According to Kabbalistic tradition, profound changesoccur in an individual going through puberty, and those changes are not onlyphysical but also spiritual.PUBERTY: MORE THAN HORMONES AND ACNEKabbalists see puberty as a long, drawn-out process, not merely one day or evena short period of time. Puberty is marked by some rather specific physiologicaldevelopments, but there’s more to it. Spiritually, puberty marks the beginningof a slow but steady process with the ultimate goal of achieving independenceand claiming full responsibility for one’s actions, thoughts, and deeds.Kabbalists practice the common Jewish celebrations that recognize the occurrenceof puberty; these celebrations arebullet [Images/check.png] Bar mitzvah (bar mitz-vah) for boysbullet [Images/check.png] Bat mitzvah (baht mitz-vah) for girlsGenerally, boys have bar mitzvahs at age 13, and girls have bat mitzvahs at age12. However, ancient texts indicate that the bar mitzvah actually occurs withthe presence of pubic hair. For Kabbalists, this physiological phenomenon marksthe beginning of a process of independence and individual responsibility. Evenmore specifically, the bar or bat mitzvah marks the beginning of a lifelongstruggle between two urges: the good urge and the evil urge.Good and evil urges, in Kabbalah, are complicated. The good urges of humankindare the pure emotions, the holy impulses to do good. Evil urges have a differentnature in that they can always be transformed into good. For the Kabbalist,nothing is evil by definition. Evil arrives when an action or thought is out ofproportion or occurs at the wrong time or the wrong dosage.It’s a common misconception among many Jews that on the occasion of the barmitzvah, a young person is suddenly responsible for the observance of rituallaw. The bar and bat mitzvah merely marks the beginning of a process whereby thecommunity recognizes the gradual process of adopting responsibilities. Teenagerswho are going through puberty assume a different status in Kabbalistic cultureand are closer to becoming independent adults, but Kabbalists understand thatthis process takes time and doesn’t happen overnight.MARKING THE BEGINNING OF THE BATTLE OF GOOD AND EVILThe Kabbalistic view of life includes the belief that the human soul containstwo urges in eternal conflict:bullet [Images/check.png] The yetzer hatov (yay-tzer hah-toev), which is theinclination for goodbullet [Images/check.png] The yetzer hara (yay-tzer hah-rah), which is theinclination for evilFromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my Kabbalah teachers stresses the importance of recognizing that lifeisn’t a quest for peace of mind but rather a recognition that a war between thegood and evil urge rages within the depths of the soul. That potential creativetension exists within one at every moment in his or her life. So the spirituallife is a war, and as my teacher puts it, the task of the spiritual seeker isdeciding “at what level to wage the war.” This process begins at puberty.Before puberty, a child isn’t responsible for his or her actions and thoughts.But Jewish tradition teaches that with the arrival of puberty a child can beginto be expected to join the struggle of good and evil and to learn how to bevictorious in that battle.An illuminating passage from the Talmud offers a deep understanding of theyetzer hara. The Talmud says that when the yetzer hara was “captured,” housesweren’t built and babies weren’t born. The important implication of thismetaphor is that the evil urge isn’t actually evil but rather has the potentialfor evil. Ironically, the source of the potential for evil is the source ofcreativity.For Kabbalists, evil is creativity gone sour. The original energy was there todo good and to create something positive, but that initial energy for positivecreativity can also be the fuel for something evil. This potential is the reasonmany of the most infamous villains of history were quite creative people.GOOD AND EVIL: A MATTER OF TIMING AND DOSAGEThe Kabbalistic view of all human traits is that all have their own times andplaces — none are good or bad.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]You may be familiar with the popular song “Turn! Turn! Turn!” recorded by TheByrds in the 1960s. The lyrics to this song come directly from the HolyScriptures that Kabbalists study all their lives. The passage comes from Kohelet(koe-heh -let; Ecclesiastes) 3:1–8 and is as follows:To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven;A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck upthat which is planted;A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to buildup;A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time toembrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;A time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.Kabbalists view both love and hate as neutral emotions; each is appropriate atsome times and inappropriate at others. For example, erotic or romantic loveisn’t appropriate between an adult and a child, and slavery and injustice aresituations to root out and hate.Life is a constant challenge, and Kabbalistic tradition asks the Kabbalist toconstantly weigh questions of timing and dosage as they relate to feelings oflove and hate. Dosage refers to the degree of an emotion; for example, on someoccasions, love is appropriate but perhaps overwhelming, passionate love is not.And some situations call for a gentler or more cautious love. As any pharmacistcan tell you, there’s a fine line between a medicine and a poison, and itusually has to do with timing and dosage. The same goes for the attributes ofthe soul.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]According to Kabbalistic belief, girls under the age of 12 and boys under theage of 13 aren’t responsible for their decisions regarding timing and dosage ofemotions and navigation through the battle between good inclinations and evilinclinations. Upon the occasion of the bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah, theKabbalist recognizes that over the next number of years (some say until the ageof 21), a young person should work on the development of his or her soul becauseresponsibility kicks in during this period.KABBALISTIC MARRIAGEMarriage is a serious and solemn event for Kabbalists. Kabbalistic marriage goesfar beyond the performance of a ritual; it ultimately connects with the verynature of the soul.JOINING TWO HALVES TO MAKE A WHOLEMany people affectionately refer to their spouse as their “other half.”Kabbalists don’t just say that, they mean it.According to Kabbalistic tradition, each soul is actually half a soul that needsanother half to be complete; this is the spiritual basis of marriage. Marriageis certainly a partnership on a mundane level, with rights and responsibilities,but at its core, marriage for a Kabbalist is the combining of two “half souls”to make a whole.BRINGING THE DIVINE PRESENCE (OR PRESENTS, IF YOU REGISTER)The result of joining two half souls to create one whole is a sacred marriagethat brings with it the divine presence. Although Kabbalists believe that thedivine presence is always with them in some way, they also believe that aspecial part of the nature of the divine presence shines its light on a marriedcouple.The joining of two souls in a marriage is a divine dance, and when thechoreography is proper and beautiful, the married couple can feel the presenceof God. Kabbalists also believe that the glow of the divine presence that comesfrom a loving marriage shines upon all who are around the couple, and theyreceive blessings as well.Kabbalists know that marriage has to do with far more than love, however divineit may be. The joining together of two souls is also the joining together of twoindividuals in the world. Kabbalists have been studying the issues surroundingone’s obligations in a marriage for many centuries.An important aspect of a marriage in the spirit of Kabbalah is that the twopeople know that the most important relationship each person has is his or herrelationship with God. Marriage is an opportunity for each member of themarriage to help the other with the most primary relation of all — therelationship with God.Husband and wife each have rights and obligations, and before marriage, theymust be aware of and in agreement with the rights and obligations that they’vedecided to share.Additionally, in the traditional wedding ceremony, the contract that the brideand groom sign includes a reference to the obligations and rights that eachparty has if the marriage ends in divorce. The marriage contract, called theketubah (keh-too -bah), requires the signatures of two witnesses who testify tothe fact that they’ve consulted with both the bride and the groom and areconfident that both parties agree that the marriage should occur and that eachof the two marriage partners, under their own free will, agrees to the terms ofthe marriage. In Jewish law, before two people get married, they must agree tovarious matters — financial (the terms of a divorce) as well as emotional andsexual.THE HOLY LETTER: A KABBALISTIC KAMA SUTRAIf you’ve ever seen the film A Stranger Among Us, you may remember a scene inwhich Melanie Griffith’s character asks a student of Kabbalah what he’s reading.He identifies the Kabbalistic book in his hands and quotes from it. It’s anauthentic Kabbalistic text called Igeret Hakodesh (ee-geh-ret hah-koh-desh; TheHoly Letter). (Traditional belief is that this book was written by Moses BenNachman, known as Nachmanides or the Ramban.)Igeret Hakodesh offers a treatise on human sexuality and teaches that sex is aholy activity. Nachmanides also states emphatically that believing that thehuman body is dirty is heresy. This Kabbalistic book teaches that every detailof the human body is a result of divine intention and that sexuality has thehighest potential to have an impact on one’s soul. The book also suggests somephysical, how-to advice, such as:bullet [Images/check.png] “You should begin with words that will draw her heartto you and will settle her mind and make her happy.”bullet [Images/check.png] “Tell her things which will produce in her desire,attachment, love, willingness, and passion.”bullet [Images/check.png] “Win her heart with words of charm and seduction.”GETTIN’ BUSY THE KABBALISTIC WAYIn the Kabbalistic worldview, God is everywhere. Because every aspect of humanlife has the potential for holiness and the potential for the opposite ofholiness, sex with one’s partner can go in many directions. The task of theKabbalist is to raise up the level of the world and reveal God in everything.The issues that Kabbalists raise regarding the sexual component of a marriageare based on the assumption that sexuality isn’t solely for procreation. Rather,marriage partners have a need and expectation for sexual intimacy with oneanother that’s independent of the urge to procreate. For the Kabbalist, thesexual urge isn’t just an animal instinct; it’s a means of expression betweenmarital partners that has great spiritual potential for intimacy, trust, andlove.Kabbalists study the following issues related to sexual relationships:bullet [Images/check.png] Pleasantness: Kabbalists believe that a primaryrequirement for the sexual encounter is that it be pleasant. Kabbalists maintainthat the proper attitude to cultivate during lovemaking is the desire to pleaseone’s partner.bullet [Images/check.png] Frequency: According to a well-known text thatKabbalists have studied for centuries, husbands and wives need to be sensitiveto each other when it comes to how often they make love.For example, if changing one’s occupation will directly impact how often aspouse will be at home, the change needs to be mutually agreed upon by bothpartners. If the couple is accustomed to a certain pace and level of intimacy, achange of occupation that rattles that pace must have unanimous approval.bullet [Images/check.png] Gentleness: Kabbalistic tradition doesn’t dictatewhich sexual positions are “acceptable” and which are not. It declares thatconsenting adults can do whatever they want with each other with the exceptionof causing physical or emotional harm.Marriage partners must do their utmost to respect their partners in all areas,including sexuality. For example, prompting one’s marital partner to cry may beconsidered a profoundly unfortunate offense.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]EROTIC IMAGERY AND KABBALAHWhen one of my children was coming-of-age and asked me to teach heraboutsexuality, the first thing I did was to go to a book of the Holy Scripturescalled Shir Hashirim (sheer hah-sheer-eem; the Song of Songs). Shir Hashirim isthe famous erotic love poem of the Torah. (It’s often called the Song ofSolomon.) Contro- versy once raged over its appropriateness as part of theBible, with the question being, “Should an erotic love poem be part of the HolyScriptures?” The answer given by the great Jewish mystic Rabbi Akiva was, “Ifthe Bible is holy, then the Song of Songs is the holy of holies.”This view that the erotic verses found in the Bible are of a holy nature is aclue to the way in which humans should understand their relationship to God.When mystics talk about merging with God, their imagery has an obvious sexualcomponent.Here’s a sampling from the text that illustrates the erotic nature of the ShirHashirim:bullet [Images/check.png] Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thylove is better than wine. (Song of Songs 1:20)bullet [Images/check.png] His left hand is under my head, and his right handdoth embrace me. (Song of Songs 2:6)bullet [Images/check.png] Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honeyand milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smellof Lebanon. (Song of Songs 4:11)bullet [Images/check.png] How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince’sdaughter! The joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of acunning workman. Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanted not liquor: Thybelly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies. Thy two breasts are liketwo young roes that are twins. Thy neck is as a tower of ivory;Thine eyes likethe fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: Thy nose is as the towerof Lebanon which looks toward Damascus. Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, andthe hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries. How fairand how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! This thy stature is like to apalm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. (Song of Songs 7:1–7)I wanted to show my child the Song of Songs because I wanted to make the pointthat, for Kabbalists, human sexuality offers perhaps the best metaphors fordescribing the relationship to the Divine. This relationship is described witherotic and passionate imagery. My instinct and my studies directed me toassociate sexuality with the highest spiritual ideas and belief.Of course, Kabbalists know that their relationships with God aren’t sexual inthe way that relationships are between husbands and wives, but the eroticconnection between husband and wife is parallel to the relationship that eachperson cultivates with God. This intimate, deeply private, and profoundrelationship often is best described by verses in the Song of Songs and theircommentary, which helps explain why Kabbalists have studied this section of theBible in great detail for many centuries.Many people have insisted that the Song of Songs is simply an ancient eroticpoem that found its way into a gathering of books now called the Bible. But asall Kabbalists know, the Song of Songs, including the most detailed verses oferoticism, have been interpreted by the great sages as ways of describing themany sublime and intimate ways people relate privately with God.WHAT ABOUT DIVORCE?Kabbalah’s holy texts express the belief that the holy altar in heaven weeps onthe occasion of a divorce. After all, when two souls marry, they merge. Whenthose same two souls disconnect, the pain reaches the heavens.Nevertheless, Kabbalists study the laws of divorce just as they study thetraditional laws of marriage. If a marriage must dissolve, traditionalprocedures and issues serve to protect the parties. These procedures are part oftraditional Jewish law as codified by the great Kabbalist, Rabbi Joseph Karo.DEATH AND DYING IN KABBALAHAccording to Kabbalah, death is a natural process, not a tragedy. One of thegreat texts, Pirke Avot (peer-kay ah-vote; the Chapters of the Sages) describeslife as a lobby for the world to come, and the Kabbalist sees his or her earthlyexistence as just one stage in the soul’s evolution. (For more on theKabbalistic soul and its journey, flip to Chapter 7.)Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalists believe that at the moment of death, the two parts of the individual— the body and the soul — separate. The body is buried in the ground, and thesoul continues on its way. Kabbalistic tradition teaches reincarnation with theunderstanding that, in most cases, the soul is reincarnated in the body ofanother person who then tries to continue to correct what the soul injured inthe past or to create what that soul is destined to create. (Refer to Chapter 7for more on the Kabbalistic belief in reincarnation.)DEATHBED CUSTOMSIt’s customary that a dying Kabbalist be kept company during his or hertransition from this world to the next world. Being with a dying person at thatmoment is considered an expression of great respect. Kabbalists encourage theperson who’s dying to make peace with this world by asking forgiveness fromfriends and family members and by blessing their children.Kabbalists also encourage the person who’s dying to recite a traditional prayercalled vidui (vi-doo -ee), which is a prayer of confession listing many commonmisdeeds. (This prayer is also recited on the holy day of Yom Kippur, which Iaddress in Chapter 11.) Kabbalists firmly believe that this recitation of theconfessional prayer neither brings on an earlier death nor negates hope forcomplete healing. They believe that this confession is connected to anunderstanding that death can serve to wipe the slate clean for the individual,whose soul then can go on with its work.Another deathbed custom is reciting from the book of Psalms in the presence ofthe person who’s dying. Of the 150 Psalms, the ones chosen deal with hope andoffer comfort. Some of the more popular Psalms for this occasion are Psalms 16,23, 25, 51, 91, 102, and 103, but many other Psalms are also suitable in thisholy moment.WHEN DEATH ARRIVESWhen the moment of death arrives, it’s customary among Kabbalists to close thedeceased’s eyes and mouth, straighten his or her limbs, keep the body covered,and treat the body with extreme care and respect. Positioning the body so thatthe deceased’s feet face the door is also customary.Additionally, Kabbalists light a candle and place it near the head of thedeceased. (Some Kabbalists light many candles and place them around the body.)From the moment of death until burial, a friend, relative, or member of thecommunity must remain with the deceased. One of the more popular Psalms recitedduring this period is the 23rd Psalm, commonly known as “The Lord is MyShepherd.”Kabbalists who are present at a death or who learn about the death recite thisblessing: Baruch Atah Ahdonai, Ehlohaynu, Mehlech Haolam, Dayan HaEhmet(bah-rukh ah-tah ah-doe-noy eh-loh-hay -nu meh -lekh hah-oh-lahm dah-yanhah-eh-met; Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, the truejudge).Upon learning of a death, Kabbalists acknowledge that, despite the sadness ofthe departure of the person that they know and love, God knows what He is doingand takes everyone at a divinely appointed time.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalists don’t see death as a finality. According to Kabbalists, the soul ofthe first man, Adam, split into hundreds of thousands of individual souls thatoccupy the bodies of people. Each individual has the task of finding his or herown part in the world, but at a certain point, the body gives out and is usedup.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]One great Kabbalist, Rabbi Baruch Ashlag, tried to explain death and therelationship of a soul to a body by saying, “Just as we change our shirts, sodoes a person who resides in his soul, sees his physical body, and knows thatfrom time to time he will need to change his ‘shirt.’” (Check out Chapter 7 formore on reincarnation in Kabbalah.)FAMOUS LAST WORDSIt’s said that when the great Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated, hislast words weren’t “They got me” but rather “Ram.” Ram is a Sanskrit termreferring to God. The traditional Hindu, as part of his or her spiritual work,desires to have God on his or her mind at that precious moment of transitionfrom life to death.Kabbalistic tradition has a similar custom. The best known and most oftenrecited prayer of Jewish and therefore Kabbalistic tradition is the Sh’ma(sheh-mah). Although the Sh’ma is a number of paragraphs long, the first line isthe most important: Sh’ma Yisrael, Ahdonai Ehlohaynu, Ahdonai Ehchad (sheh-mahyis-rah-ehl ah-doh-noy eh-loh-hay-noo ah-doh-noy eh-chahd; Hear O Israel, theLord our God, the Lord is One).One of the great Kabbalists of all time, the extraordinary Rabbi Akiva, died atthe hands of the Romans almost 2,000 years ago. Kabbalists believe that whenRabbi Akiva was arrested and tortured to death, he not only recited the words ofthe Sh’ma prayer but actually extended the last word, ehchad (eh-chahd; one).This story has been a model for centuries of Kabbalists who, when reciting theSh’ma prayer, also prolong the last word, “ehchad.”When reciting the Sh’ma, a Kabbalist should say the word “ehchad” as long as ittakes for him or her to conceive of all six directions (north, south, east,west, up, and down). While speaking the last word of the Sh’ma, the Kabbalistconceives of God as being in all directions and everywhere and also acknowledgesGod’s oneness.FOLLOWING THE STEPS OF MOURNINGDespite the fact that Kabbalistic theology recognizes death as a normal and anatural part of existence, death is still a great shock to close relatives, andauthentic grief is neither shameful nor inappropriate. The structure ofKabbalistic mourning divides the stages of mourning into a number of levels oflessening severity.PULLING A HAIR FROM A GLASS OF MILKAn ancient Kabbalistic text poses the question, “What does it feel like when thebody and soul separate?” The answer given in this text is that, in most cases,the separation of the soul from its body is “like pulling out a hair from aglass of milk.”Before you say, “Ew, yuck!” let me explain: Pulling a hair from a glass of milkis a familiar activity in rural life, so it stands to reason that the ancienttext would use this metaphor when describing the separation of body and soul afew thousand years ago. It’s a task that many people would have been able torelate to.This teaching reminds me of the months I spent living in a small fishing villagein southern Spain. Each day, I went to the home of the goatherd and purchasedgoat’s milk from his wife. Upon returning home, I often needed to pull somestray goat hairs out of the milk before I boiled it and used it for drinking orcooking. Pulling a hair from a glass of milk is a simple, painless thing to do —just as separating the body and soul is for the Angel of Death to do when Godwills it.THE FIRST DAYWhen a parent, child, sibling, or spouse dies, the Kabbalist measures the firststage of mourning as the period between death and burial. Jewish law urges that,whenever possible, burial should take place within a day of the death. Thisstage requires the mourner to care for the deceased and prepare the body forburial, and this responsibility takes precedence over all other commandmentswithin Kabbalistic tradition.BURIALA funeral for a Kabbalist has a few notable aspects:bullet [Images/check.png] Tradition calls for the coffin to be a simple box,usually constructed of pine. Despite the fact that one can go to a funeral homeand choose from more expensive caskets with extraordinarily polished outsidesand plush, lavish insides, these options aren’t appropriate among Kabbalists.They recognize dignity in the simplicity of a plain pine box.In some ways, Kabbalists view death as the great equalizer. Regardless of howrich or influential a person is in life, upon death everyone is in the samesituation, and luxurious caskets are inappropriate. Kabbalists also tend todress the deceased in a white shroud and wrap him or her in the prayer shawlused during life.bullet [Images/check.png] The eulogy must not contain any exaggerations. Thereare always good things to say about individuals without having to speakfalsehoods. More importantly, Kabbalistic tradition doesn’t want to encouragemourners to think ill of the deceased. If a eulogy states that the deceased wasa very charitable person when, in fact, he wasn’t, such an exaggeration couldprompt someone in attendance to walk away thinking, “He wasn’t as generous asthey said.”bullet [Images/check.png] Kabbalists recite traditional prayers when the coffinis lowered into the grave, and they participate in filling the grave with soil(rather than leaving it up to a stranger employed by the cemetery). Theseintense acts bring psychological wisdom, impressing upon the mourners thefinality of the individual’s life on earth.THE FIRST WEEK AFTER DEATHThe Hebrew word shiva (shih -vah; seven) refers to a seven-day period of intensemourning that begins after burial, which is counted as the first day. Duringthis week, Kabbalists sit on low stools or on the floor to symbolize being“brought low” emotionally by their grief. They’re also subject to the followingrestrictions, many of which involve a prohibition against attention to thebodies and pleasures of the mourners themselves, whose grief prompts them toforget about their own comforts and physical delight:bullet [Images/check.png] Leather shoes aren’t worn. (In ancient times, leatherwas a symbol of comfort and wealth.)bullet [Images/check.png] Hair isn’t cut, and men don’t shave.bullet [Images/check.png] Women don’t wear cosmetics.bullet [Images/check.png] Mourners don’t work.bullet [Images/check.png] Mourners don’t bathe.bullet [Images/check.png] Mourners don’t have sexual relations.bullet [Images/check.png] Mourners don’t put on fresh clothes.bullet [Images/check.png] Mourners don’t study holy texts other than those thatrelate specifically to mourning and grief. (Studying holy texts provides greatpleasure and therefore isn’t appropriate during the week of mourning.)bullet [Images/check.png] The mirrors in the homes of mourners are covered toavoid giving attention to one’s own vanity.From the time of the funeral of a parent or another member of the immediatefamily circle, surviving relatives recite a traditional prayer known as theKaddish (kah -dish). Mourners recite the Kaddish three times daily. Aninteresting aspect of the Kaddish is that there’s no mention of death in theprayer. Although the Kaddish is known as a mourner’s prayer, the text of it hasmore to do with the expression of one’s faith in God. The text of the Kaddish isas follows:Glorified and sanctified be God’s great name throughout the world which He hascreated according to His will. May He establish His kingdom in your lifetime andduring your days, and within the life of the entire House of Israel, speedilyand soon; and say, Amen.May His great name be blessed forever and to all eternity.Blessed and praised, glorified and exalted, extolled and honored, adored andlauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, beyond all the blessings andhymns, praises and consolations that are ever spoken in the world; and say,Amen.May there be abundant peace from heaven, and life, for us and for all Israel;and say, Amen.He who creates peace in His celestial heights, may He create peace for us andfor all Israel; and say, Amen.THE FIRST MONTHAfter the first week of intense mourning (shiva), the next and less severe levelof mourning, shloshim (shih-low-sheem; 30), begins.During this 30-day period, mourners don’t attend celebrations, listen to music,or shave, but most of the other severities of the first week are suspended. (Seethe preceding section for a list of shiva restrictions.) Mourners continuereciting the Kaddish three times daily.THE FIRST YEARDuring the first 12 months after a burial, mourners don’t attend celebrations ofany kind. Mourners continue to recite the Kaddish prayer three times daily for11 out of the 12 months that follow. Why 11 months and not 12? Out of respectfor the deceased. Kabbalists believe that it can take up to 12 months for a soulto purify itself, and by stopping the recitation of the Kaddish after 11 months,mourners imply that the deceased’s soul wasn’t so impure that it needed the full12 months for purification.OBSERVING THE DEATH ANNUALLYEach year, Kabbalist mourners note the anniversary of a death, known as ayahrzeit (yahr -tzite). In addition to reciting the Kaddish on that day in thesynagogue, the mourners also often receive an honor during the synagogueservice. This honor is usually in the form of an aliyah (ah-lee -ah; ascent),which is the recitation a blessing for all the congregation to hear just beforeverses from the Torah scroll are read out loud. Other tasks that are part of thepublic worship service in the synagogue are also sometimes offered as honors. Inany case, the honors are the community’s gestures of recognition of the mournerand in memory of the deceased.It’s also customary for a Kabbalist to light a 24-hour candle on the one-yearanniversary of a death; commemorating the death in this way reiterates thebelief that death is a moment of transition and not a finality."},{"pageContent":"PART IVFINE-TUNING THE ESSENTIAL SKILLS OF THE KABBALIST[Images/915904 fgCN04.jpg]In this part . . .Kabbalists communicate with God in two ways: by studying and by praying.

In studying the holy books as well ascommentaries on them, the Kabbalist receives messages and teachings from God andalso sees how the great sages responded to those messages. When praying, theKabbalist is engaged in a dialogue with the Almighty. By both studying andpraying, the Kabbalist encounters one of the great paradoxes of Jewish life:establishing an intimate relationship with an inconceivable God."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13DISCOVERING THE KABBALISTIC BOOKS THAT REALLY MATTERIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Starting with centuries-old must-havesbullet [Images/arrow.png] Filling up Kabbalistic bookshelvesbullet [Images/arrow.png] Including Hasidic texts and commentariesKabbalists always have books around them — in their homes, synagogues, and studyhalls. The walls of these spaces usually are lined with bookshelves, and thebookshelves usually are filled with well-worn volumes of the great books thatKabbalists study. (I daresay that if you didn’t have lots of books around you,then your authenticity as a Kabbalist would certainly be in question.)In this chapter, you discover the important books that Kabbalists study. Eventhough thousands of books make up the library of spiritual volumes of Judaism, Ifocus on the major holy books of Jewish spiritual life, with a special emphasison the most important and vital books studied by Kabbalists over the centuries.THE ESSENTIAL KABBALAH LIBRARYThousands of books written and published over the centuries are of interest toKabbalists, but a much smaller number of volumes have made up a Kabbalist’sbasic library since the beginning of Kabbalistic tradition.A Kabbalist spends lots of time with his or her books, and it isn’t unusual tofind a study table filled with books by the end of a study session. Commentarieson the Torah (toe -rah) refer to other volumes, which in turn refer to others.For example, a Kabbalist may start a study session by reading a familiar storyin the Five Books of Moses. The student typically will refer to a commentary onthe verses that make up that story, and the commentary refers to a homiletictext found in a collection of insights into the Torah compiled during Rabbinictimes. Those texts are quoted in commentaries by other sages, and the processgoes on and on. Each commentator offers insight into an eternal discussion thatusually begins with the text of the Torah.This section introduces the books that are among the standard texts in aKabbalist’s library. The first two categories, the Tanakh and the classicRabbinic literature, form the basis of all Torah study. The Tanakh and theTalmud represent the foundation upon which all Kabbalists and students of theTorah participate in the vital, daily activity of Talmud Torah (tal-mood toe-rah; the holy act of Torah study).TANAKHThe word tanakh (tah-nak ) is an acronym for three Hebrew letters. The firstletter, which has the sound of a “t,” stands for Torah, which refers to the FiveBooks of Moses in this case. The Hebrew letter with the “n” sound stands for theword Nevi’im (neh-vee -eem; the Prophets). The third letter, which has the soundof a “k,” stands for Ketuvim (keh-too -veem; writings). Tanakh is a collectionof all three: the Five Books of Moses, the biblical books of the Prophets, andthe biblical books of the Writings.Outside of the Jewish world, Tanakh is called the Old Testament, but Jews don’tuse this term because it implies the existence of a new testament, which isn’tpart of the Hebrew Scriptures. Sometimes Jews refer to Tanakh as the HolyScriptures.THE TORAH, THE FIVE BOOKS OF MOSESTanakh begins with the Five Books of Moses, the original written traditionrepresenting the revelation of Moses at Mount Sinai. Kabbalists consider theTorah to be the collected permutations of divine wisdom. They believe that Goddeliberately contracted Himself and that the words of the Torah are onetransmission of divine wisdom.Kabbalists intensely study a portion of the Torah every week along withcommentaries on the Torah portions.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The word “Torah” refers to the Five Books of Moses, the entire Bible, and alsocommentaries on the central texts from throughout the centuries. When aKabbalist says that he or she is studying “Torah,” it doesn’t necessarily meanthe Five Books of Moses. All Jewish and Kabbalistic spiritual books, in someway, grow out of the original transmission of the Five Books of Moses asreceived by Moses from God at Mount Sinai. That’s is why the term “Torah” hasboth a restricted and a broad meaning.The Five Books of Mosesbullet [Images/check.png] Tell the story of the creation of the world:Kabbalists examine every detail in the description of the Creation in theopening chapters of the Torah, and this analysis of the Torah text along withthe use of the terms and vocabulary in it to express complex ideas aboutexistence itself form the basis of a significant part of Kabbalistic discussionsof the most abstract ideas about the ways of the universe.bullet [Images/check.png] Teach about the lives of the great patriarchs andmatriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah): Thesebiblical personalities and many others are frequent companions of the Kabbalist,who knows them deeply enough to speak of them in the present tense. For example,in the Kabbalist’s mind, Abraham didn’t live thousands of years ago; rather,Abraham’s as present as anyone alive (and perhaps even more so). Kabbalists alsooften speak of the patriarchs and other biblical heroes as representing the tensefirot (see Chapter 4). These figures become part of the process and discussionof reaching to grasp the way of the world.bullet [Images/check.png] Tell of Jacob’s encounter with an angel and hisspiritual transformation from Jacob into Israel: The Five Books of Moses is, ifanything, a record of the human relationship with God, from the story of Adamand Eve to the encounter by Moses. A pivotal episode in these holy books is thestory of Jacob, who encounters a messenger of God. He and his descendants, theJewish people, are changed by this divine encounter forever. It’s not surprisingthat Kabbalists, whose lives are focused on the Infinite One, are interested inlooking carefully at the Torah’s descriptions of these encounters with God.bullet [Images/check.png] Describe the enslavement of the Children of Israel inEgypt, their successful rebellion against that slavery, and their wandering inthe desert for 40 years: The spiritual life of the Kabbalist is an importanttopic in many Kabbalistic texts, which frequently explore the nature of theprocess of spiritual growth and refinement. The way of the Kabbalist is the wayof raising one’s consciousness, and the methods for reaching higher or perhapsdeeper levels of understanding are often found in the study and discussions ofthe trials encountered by the main personalities of the Torah and the evolutionof the Children of Israel. Slavery in Egypt by the Children of Israel and theultimate exodus from that place is a major theme of Kabbalistic study.bullet [Images/check.png] Relate the great moment of revelation, when Mosesreceived the divine teachings from God on Mount Sinai and all the Children ofIsrael experienced an unparalleled encounter with God: Kabbalists say that eachperson can be standing at Mount Sinai at any moment to experience thisrevelation and that proper study, prayer, and holy deeds can purify people andopen them to divine revelation. Kabbalists go on to say that each person whostudies Torah stands at Mount Sinai, hears the teachings, and joins in theprocess of revealing God in the world.bullet [Images/check.png] Teach fundamental principles and basic rules forliving: The Five Books of Moses, along with the classic Rabbinic literature,teach the principles of life. A special aspect of the Rabbinic literature isthat it invites every generation to join in the process of studying theseprinciples and continuing to add new insights and commentaries. (See the section“Classic Rabbinic literature” later in this chapter for details.)The following list contains the Hebrew names of each of the Five Books of Mosesfollowed by the names used in most English editions. And even though everydetail of every word of the Torah is rich with meaning for the Kabbalist, I alsolist some of the main topics in each book.bullet [Images/check.png] Bereishit (buh-ray-sheet; in the beginning): Genesis• The creation of the world• Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (the patriarchs)• Jacob goes to Egypt with his sons• Before his death, Jacob blesses his sonsbullet [Images/check.png] Sh’mot (sheh-mote; the names): Exodus• The Children of Israel are enslaved in Egypt• Moses receives the Torah at Mount Sinai• The Children of Israel build a tabernacle in the desertbullet [Images/check.png] Vayikra (vah-yih-krah; and He called): Leviticus• The priestly code• Laws of sacrifice and morality, and dietary laws• The Land of Israel• The major festivalsbullet [Images/check.png] Bamidbar (bah-mid-bar; in the wilderness): Numbers• Statutes and laws• The Children of Israel are on the way to the Holy Landbullet [Images/check.png] Devarim (deh-vah-reem; the words): Deuteronomy• A retelling of the laws• Moses addresses the Children of IsraelNEVI’IM, THE PROPHETSPeople often think that a prophet is someone who can predict the future, butaccording to Jewish tradition, in addition to possibly being such a seer, aprophet is someone chosen by God to deliver a message from God to the people.The word for “prophet” in Hebrew is Navi (neh-vee ). There were many prophets inbiblical times, both men and women, and the books of the prophets all containprofound messages.The Nevi’im (neh-vee -eem; books of the Prophets) arebullet [Images/check.png] Yehoshua (yeh-hoe-shoe-ah; Joshua)bullet [Images/check.png] Shoftim (showf-teem; Judges)bullet [Images/check.png] Shmuel (shmoo-ale; Samuel I and II)bullet [Images/check.png] Melachim (meh-lah-kheem; Kings I and II)bullet [Images/check.png] Yeshayah (yeh-shah-yah; Isaiah)bullet [Images/check.png] Yirmiyah (year-mee-yah; Jeremiah)bullet [Images/check.png] Yechezkel (yeh-khez-kill; Ezekiel)bullet [Images/check.png] Trey Asar (tray ah-sar; the Twelve) (treated as onebook)• Hoshea (hoe-she-ah; Hosea)• Yoel (yo-ale; Joel)• Amus (ah-muhs; Amos)• Ovadyah (oh-vahd-yah; Obadiah)• Yonah (yoh-nah; Jonah)• Michah (mee-khah; Micah)• Nachum (nah-khoom; Nachum)• Chavakuk (khah-vah-kook; Habbakkuk)• Tzefanyah (tzeh-fahn-yah; Zephaniah)• Chagai (khah-guy; Chagai)• Zecharyah (zeh-khar-ee-yah; Zechariah)• Malachi (mah-lah-khee; Malachi)KETUVIM, THE WRITINGSKetuvim (keh-too -veem; writings) is the third section of the Holy Scriptures;it consists of some of the most well-known parts of the Bible. This sectioncontains the book of Psalms, the book of Proverbs, the book of Job, the Song ofSongs, and other books that are neither books of the Prophets nor the Five Booksof Moses.The Ketuvim arebullet [Images/check.png] Tehillim (teh-hill-eem; Psalms)bullet [Images/check.png] Mishlei (mish-lay; Proverbs)bullet [Images/check.png] Iyov (ee-yove; Job)bullet [Images/check.png] Shir HaShirim (sheer hah-sheer-eem; Song of Songs)bullet [Images/check.png] Rut (ruht; Ruth)bullet [Images/check.png] Eichah (aye-khah; Lamentations)bullet [Images/check.png] Kohelet (koh-heh-let; Ecclesiastes)bullet [Images/check.png] Esther (es-tair; Esther)bullet [Images/check.png] Daniel (dahn-ee-el; Daniel)bullet [Images/check.png] Nechemyah (neh-hem-eye-ah; Nehemiah)bullet [Images/check.png] Divrei Hayamim (div-ray hah-yah-meem; Chronicles)CLASSIC RABBINIC LITERATUREClassic Rabbinic literature consists of the Mishnah (mish-nah; repetition),which is the written record of the oral teachings received by Moses at MountSinai, and the Talmud (tal-mood; learning), which is a commentary on the Mishnahwritten by the generations following the writing of the Mishnah.THE MISHNAHKabbalistic tradition believes that when Moses went up Mount Sinai, he receivedtwo Torahs: One Torah was written, and the other was oral. The oral tradition ispassed from one generation to the next. Writing down the oral tradition isforbidden; it must be kept fluid and alive and not constrained by exact wordsand letters.Approximately 2,000 years ago, the leader of the Jewish people, a man namedRabbi Judah (who was known as Rebbe), and his colleagues realized that so manygreat people had been slaughtered and that the Oral Tradition was at risk ofbeing lost. For these reasons, Rabbi Judah recorded the Oral Tradition inwriting. This work, which is divided into six sections and contains the entireOral Tradition in a kind of concise Hebrew, is known as the Mishnah.In a sense, a compromise was reached whereby the great sages supported RabbiJudah in creating an extremely concise written document reflecting the vast OralTradition originally received from God at Mount Sinai.Studying a little bit of the Mishnah every day has been a Kabbalistic practicefor many centuries. The Mishnah is divided into small teachings that are quitesuitable for this kind of study.THE TALMUDAfter Rabbi Judah wrote the Mishnah (see the preceding section), generations ofscholars studied it intensely and sought to expand upon its concise language.The first several generations of sages after the writing of the Mishnah produceda commentary referred to as the Talmud (see Figure 13-1 for a sample page fromthis text).Figure 13-1: A sample page from the Talmud.Figure 13-1: A sample page from the Talmud. [Images/915904 fg1301.jpg]The Talmud, which consists of 63 volumes of legend, lore, and laws, is the mostimportant holy text studied by traditional Kabbalists in their classicaleducation. Every subject imaginable appears in the Talmud, from the most mundaneto the most sublime, from the most practical to the most esoteric. Philosophicaldiscussions, folk medicine, profound stories, fierce debates, and the probing ofmystical ideas all appear within the Talmud text.The Talmud has been growing for centuries as great commentators add to the textitself. For example, the great sage of Jewish tradition, Rashi, who lived inFrance and was born around the year 1000, wrote a comprehensive commentary onthe Mishnah that appears in every edition of the Talmud. The commentaries of hisillustrious grandsons and their students, who often disagree with Rashi, alsoappear. In each generation, students of the Mishnah and its commentaries (all ofwhich is known as the Talmud) join in the eternal discussion of eternal ideas.The Talmud is the cornerstone of the culture out of which all Kabbalists emerge.Every great Kabbalist since the beginning of Kabbalistic tradition has been amaster of the study of the Talmud. Kabbalists throughout the centuries have beenfamiliar with the Talmud and study it almost every day.MIDRASHIC LITERATURE: CLASSICAL COMPILATIONSMidrash (mid -rahsh; to seek out) is a term that’s hard to define because it hasseveral facets. It represents different ways to approach the biblical texts —sometimes understanding the laws of Tanakh and sometimes finding the moralteachings, ethical principles, mystical ideas, and profound theology embedded inthe text.The Midrash is a large and unique collection of classic spiritual literaturethat emerged nearly two millennia ago and continued to develop and grow forcenturies. Midrashic literature may appear from the outside to be essentially aclose commentary on the Bible that adds to the detail of the biblical drama, butin reality, this library of biblical commentary is far more. It contains some ofthe most profound and important ideas and injunctions in all of Jewish — andtherefore Kabbalistic — literature.The following books make up the midrashic literature collection:bullet [Images/check.png] Mekhilta: The Mekhilta (meh-khil-tuh; measure) is acommentary on the book of Exodus.bullet [Images/check.png] Sifra on Leviticus: The Sifra (sihf-rah; Aramaic for“the book”) is said to be from the tradition of Rabbi Akiva, the great Rabbinicsage and mystic. Parts of the Sifra also come from the school of Rabbi Ishmael.Although the Sifra is a commentary on parts of the book of Leviticus, it’s alsoa commentary on parts of the Mishnah.bullet [Images/check.png] Sifre on Numbers and Deuteronomy: The Sifre (sif-ree;writing) goes back to the schools of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael and focuseson the biblical verses found in the book of Numbers and the book of Deuteronomy.bullet [Images/check.png] The Pesikhta: The Pesikhta (peh-sikh-tah) is acompilation of homiletic statements that is a commentary on the Five Books ofMoses and specific teachings from the books of the Prophets.bullet [Images/check.png] Seder Olam Rabbah: This book, pronounced say-deroh-lahm rah-bah, covers topics from the creation of the universe to the buildingof the Second Temple.bullet [Images/check.png] Yalkut Shimoni: The Yalkut Shimoni (yahl-kootshih-moe-nee) is a collection of commentaries on the entire Tanakh. It wascompiled in the 13th century and consists of collections of commentaries from 50different works.bullet [Images/check.png] Tanna Devei Eliyahu: This holy text, pronouncedtah-nah deh-vay eh-lee-ah-hoo, stresses the study of Torah, prayer, andrepentance as the primary activities of the spiritual seeker.bullet [Images/check.png] The Midrash Rabbah: The Midrash Rabbah (mid-rahshrah-bah ) is a collection of ten volumes on different books of the Bible. Theywere written by different authors, in different locales, in different historicaleras. The ones on Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy chiefly consist ofhomilies on the Scripture selections for the Sabbath or festival; the othersoffer more of a critical analysis.The following works make up the Midrash Rabbah:• Bereshit Rabbah (Genesis Rabbah): A commentary on the book of Genesis thatcontains many parables and Rabbinic sayings• Shemot Rabbah (Exodus Rabbah): A commentary on the book of Exodus• Vayyiqra Rabbah (Leviticus Rabbah): A collection of commentaries on the bookof Leviticus• Bamidbar Rabbah (Numbers Rabbah): A commentary on the book of Numbers• Devarim Rabbah (Deuteronomy Rabbah): A commentary on the book of Deuteronomy• Shir Hashirim Rabbah (Song of Songs Rabbah): A beautiful collection of wisdomconnected to the verses of the Song of Songs• Ruth Rabbah: A commentary on the book of Ruth• Eicha Rabbah: A commentary on the book of Lamentations• Esther Rabbah: A commentary on the book of Esther• Kohelet Rabbah: A commentary on the book of EcclesiastesTHE ZOHAR: THE ALL-TIME KABBALISTIC CLASSICThere are four general approaches to understanding the teachings in the Torah:the literal meaning, the homiletic meaning, the hints that the text implies, andthe secret, mystical meaning. The Zohar (zoh -har) contains the mostconcentrated and extensive gathering of mystical teachings of Judaism; theseteachings explore the nature of God; the structure and origins of the universe;the nature of the human soul, sin, good, and evil; and many other spiritualsubjects. (Figure 13-2 features the opening page of this great book.)Figure 13-2: The opening page of the Zohar.Figure 13-2: The opening page of the Zohar. [Images/915904 fg1302.jpg]After a Kabbalist has great familiarity with Tanakh, the Mishnah, the Talmud,and the Midrashic literature, the Zohar becomes a major focus of his or herstudy. Without a healthy familiarity with those earlier sacred books, the Zoharis nearly impossible to appreciate. But with a firm grounding in the traditionalsacred books of the Jewish people, the Kabbalist can enter a mystical world withprofound insights into the relationship between humans and God.WHO WROTE THE ZOHAR?Traditionally, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who lived in the early part of the 2ndcentury, is believed to be the author of the Zohar. However, many scholars ofJewish history and Kabbalah, including Heinrich Graetz and Gershom Scholem, havesupported the view that, although tradition attributes the Zohar to Rabbi Shimonbar Yochai, 13th-century Rabbi Moses de Leon was its author. Some even believethat Rabbi Moses de Leon claimed that he was making copies of old manuscriptsthat he obtained from the Holy Land and supported himself, in part, by sellingportions of the Zohar to those who expressed interest in the mystical tradition.Originally, the Zohar consisted of many individual manuscripts in no particularorder. Eventually much of it was arranged parallel to many of the weekly Torahportions. The text, written mostly in Aramaic with some Hebrew, has beendescribed as a mystical novel telling of a group of rabbis who wander about theGalilean countryside exchanging the secret teachings of the Torah.Jewish lore relates that Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, the author of the Zohar (seethe sidebar “Who wrote the Zohar?”), was pursued by the Romans. He and his sontook refuge in a cave for 13 years. During that time, Rabbi Shimon and his sonstudied Torah, both the written Torah and the mystical teachings known as ToratHaSod (toe-raht hah-sowd; the secret Torah, which has come to mean “Kabbalah”).The result of these years in hiding was the writing of the Zohar.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]Outsiders often think that the Zohar is the central book of Kabbalah. There’s noquestion that the Zohar is an important Kabbalistic text, but it surely isn’tthe most important Kabbalistic text — that would be the Torah, the Five Books ofMoses. My teacher offered an amusing insight on the subject. He said that peopleoften think that the Zohar is the “secret” text and the Five Books of Moses is atext whose message is revealed on the surface. However, the opposite is true: Inthe Zohar, the details of Kabbalah often rest right on the surface of the text,whereas the secrets of the received tradition are hidden in the Five Books ofMoses.Warning(bomb) [Images/Warning(bomb).jpg]The English-language reader doesn’t have many options when it comes to studyingthe Zohar. For many years, the only English translation of a significant pieceof the Zohar was a literal translation done in Great Britain several decades agoand published by Soncino Press. This translation isn’t famous for its usefulnessand, in my opinion, isn’t the best place to start a study of the Zohar.More recently, Dr. Daniel Matt undertook an ambitious project to translate theZohar volume by volume. Known as the Pritzker Edition, scholars have admired thework as a fine translation, but it has limited use for students who can’t readthe Zohar in its original language.Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]A number of one-volume anthologies cover portions of the Zohar, but no completeEnglish translation with thorough commentary exists as of this writing. So thebest approach to studying the Zohar is to find a qualified teacher who offers acourse on the Zohar in which one can focus on brief passages and reap therewards of Zohar study.OTHER CLASSIC BOOKS WORTH ADDING TO THE COLLECTIONThe books and holy texts covered earlier in this chapter are all popular andwell known among Kabbalists. But they aren’t the only important works. A fewother essential Kabbalah classics are worthy of mention and are sure to appearin (almost) every Kabbalist’s library.SEFER BAHIR (THE BOOK OF ILLUMINATION)Sefer Bahir, a classic Kabbalistic text said to be the first Jewish document toexplicitly discuss reincarnation, is a brief document of less than 200paragraphs. Each paragraph contains one or more verses from the Bible. The textalso contains many references to the Talmud, the Midrash, and other books.Scholars generally agree that the book was written in the 1100s.Three major concepts that appear in Sefer Bahir generally aren’t found inearlier texts. They arebullet [Images/check.png] The earliest explicit reference to the ten sefirotbullet [Images/check.png] The designation of one of the ten sefirot in thefemininebullet [Images/check.png] The depiction of the divine world as a treeThese three ideas are major ones in Kabbalistic tradition. In recent decades,the late Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan wrote a translation and commentary on Sefer Bahircalled simply Bahir that remains the only English-language source available tohelp students study Sefer Bahir. It’s available from many major onlinebooksellers.SEFER YETZIRAH (THE BOOK OF FORMATION)Many modern scholars consider Sefer Yetzirah to be the earliest Kabbalistictext, and its origin has long been a topic of debate. Scholarly evidenceindicates that it first appeared in the tenth century, but the exact date of itsorigin is unknown. Some scholars say that it was created in the first centuryand was written before the destruction of the Holy Temple in the year 70. Otherscholars say that it was written in the ninth century, and still others thinkthat it was written in the third or fourth century. Traditionally, SeferYetzirah is attributed to Abraham the patriarch.Sefer Yetzirah is a book of cosmology and includes a description of the processof creation through the power of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. It refersto the universe as being formed by “thirty-two wondrous paths of wisdom.” Thesepaths are the pathways of connection between the ten sefirot and the assignmentof the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Sefer Yetzirah looks closely at theletters of the Hebrew alphabet and derives cosmological significance from theircombinations.According to Sefer Yetzirah, the universe was created through the speech of God,and God speaks continuously as a way of both creating and maintaining theuniverse. This concept leads Kabbalists to conclude that the laws of theuniverse are, in a sense, the laws of the grammar of divine speech. For theKabbalist, grammar is a part of the structure of the universe.The late Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan wrote an English translation and commentary of SeferYetzirah. Another tool for studying Sefer Yetzirah is An Introduction to JewishMysticism by Leonard Glotzer. Glotzer’s book addresses the commentary of theVilna Gaon, a Jewish personality well known for his disagreement with Hasidimand its followers’ approach to their faith. The Vilna Gaon was a serious studentof Sefer Yetzirah, and his commentary remains perhaps the ultimate commentaryfor serious students of Sefer Yetzirah.ETZ CHAYIM (THE TREE OF LIFE)Most Kabbalists consider Rabbi Isaac Luria, the Ari, to be the greatestKabbalist who ever lived. He was born in Tzfat, moved to Egypt, and thenreturned to Tzfat in the year 1570, at which time a group of devoted disciplesgathered around him. Rabbi Luria wrote very little and died at the age of 38 or39 during a plague.A few fragments of his writings have survived, however, thanks to one of hisdisciples, Rabbi Chaim Vital, who was a great scholar. One such work that offersthe teachings of Rabbi Isaac Luria is known as Etz Chayim. The first part ofthis book was translated into English and is called The Tree of Life, but EtzChayim hasn’t been translated into English in its entirety.THE SHULCHAN ARUCH (THE PREPARED TABLE)The Shulchan Aruch, often referred to as the Code of Jewish Law, has become aguidebook for the behavior of every Kabbalist. It also contains the preciseJewish laws followed by traditional Jews around the world since it was writtenin the 1500s.The author of the Shulchan Aruch, Rabbi Joseph Karo, was a great Kabbalist, amystic, and a visionary. Every law in the book has a Kabbalistic commentary thatillustrates that the discipline of traditional Jewish law isn’t a separate realmfrom mysticism and spirituality but rather is its most concrete and greatestexpression. For a Kabbalist, Jewish law is his or her spiritual practice.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]You may be startled to see the strict Code of Jewish Law on a list of essentialKabbalistic texts, but it actually makes complete sense. From the beginning ofthe tradition, Kabbalists have been strict adherents of the study of Jewish law.TOMER DEVORAH (THE PALM TREE OF DEBORAH)Rabbi Moshe ben Yaakov Cordovero, one of the most important and influentialJewish mystics and a leading figure in the illustrious circle of Kabbalists in16th-century Tzfat, wrote Tomer Devorah, an ethical work devoted to the conceptof the imitation of God.In this book, Rabbi Cordovero offers a systematic approach to the variousattributes of God and explains how to work on improving oneself by imitatingthose attributes. A few English translations of this classic of Kabbalah areavailable.THE WORKS OF RABBI MOSHE CHAIM LUZZATTORabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, known as the Ramchal after his initials, is perhapsbest known for his masterpiece, Messilat Yesharim (The Path of the Just). Thisbook has been studied in all schools of Jewish learning for centuries. In fact,some great Jewish scholars have even committed it to memory! In the words of onegreat sage of Jewish tradition, Rabbi Yisroel Salanter, “All the classical worksof Jewish ethics demonstrate that man must fear God. Messilat Yesharim tells ushow.”Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto was one of the most brilliant Kabbalists in history.One of the most prolific contemporary Kabbalists, Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, reportedthat the Vilna Gaon once declared that Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto had the mostprofound understanding of Judaism that any human could attain. The Vilna Gaonalso said that if the Ramchal had been alive during his (the Vilna Gaon’s)lifetime, he would have walked from Vilna, Lithuania, to Italy to sit at hisfeet and learn from him.Two of the Ramchal’s greatest books, Derech Hashem (The Way of God) and MissilatYesharim (The Path of the Just), are available in English translationsTHE TORAH COMMENTARY OF NACHMANIDESRabbi Moses ben Nachman, well known as a 12th-century Kabbalist and biblicalcommentator, is known both by the name Nachmanides (a Greek translation of hisname) as well as the Ramban (an acronym of his Hebrew name and title.)The Ramban stated that he wrote his commentary on the Five Books of Moses todiscover the hidden meanings of the words “for in the Torah are hidden everywonder and every mystery, and in her treasures is sealed every beauty ofwisdom.” An English translation of his Kabbalistic Torah commentary isavailable.THE THIRTEEN PETALLED ROSERabbi Adin Steinsaltz of Jerusalem is a master Talmudist and Kabbalist and oneof the most influential rabbis of our time. In addition to his monumentalcommentary on the entire Talmud, a task that no single individual hasaccomplished for 1,000 years, Rabbi Steinsaltz is also the author of dozens ofbooks on Judaism and Kabbalah. His masterpiece of Kabbalah is the contemporaryclassic, The Thirteen Petalled Rose, which has been described by many not as abook about Kabbalah but a book of Kabbalah.Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]Of all the books in the English language that I could recommend for a glimpseinto the profound teachings of Kabbalah, The Thirteen Petalled Rose is first onmy list.DON’T FORGET A FEW HASIDIC BOOKSThe Hasidic movement, which is firmly based on the principles of Kabbalah, wasfounded by the Baal Shem Tov in the 18th century. It grew to great numbers inEastern Europe and ultimately suffered terrible and huge losses with theHolocaust. After World War II, Hasidism experienced a great revival and hascontinued to grow and thrive since then. Once again Hasidism has became animportant and influential part of Judaism, and it’s the most rapidly growingsegment of the Jewish world. The Baal Shem Tov and the Hasidic leaders that havefollowed him have all been dedicated to bringing the teachings of Kabbalah tothe masses. All texts written by or based on the teachings of the Hasidicmasters are therefore Kabbalistic books, either explicitly or based on thetheological assumptions of Kabbalah.Hasidism is often an oral tradition, and there has been something of ahesitation when it comes to writing down the teachings of Hasidism. Instead,spiritual leaders encourage the transmission from spiritual master to spiritualstudent, from one generation to the next. Nevertheless, a number of Hasidicpersonalities and their writings have become well-known and popular, and thesewritings are available in English. In recent years, translations of texts by awide variety of Hasidic authors have become available, but three in particulardeserve special attention.THE TANYAThe Hasidic group Lubavitch has had seven leaders since its inception. The firstwas Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, who wrote a book that’s generally known as theTanya.The Tanya is a book of practical and modern Kabbalah for the layperson. In it,Rabbi Shneur Zalman (also known as the Baal Ha Tanya) presents readers with aview of the structure of the human soul and offers deliberate teachings on theway in which one can master the parts of the soul in order to send it in theright direction, upward to the Divine. A challenging book, the Tanya encouragesthe average reader to step on the spiritual path and make progress as a studentand as a spiritual entity. Members of Lubavitch study this book of Kabbalah on aregular basis, and a number of key commentaries have been published andtranslated into English, most notably by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz in his twovolumes, Opening the Tanya and Learning From the Tanya.RABBI ADIN STEINSALTZ’S DISCOURSESA unique set of books for Kabbalah study is Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz’s Discourseson Hasidic Thought. (The individual titles are: The Long Shorter Way, TheSustaining Utterance, In the Beginning, and The Candle of God. ) From my pointof view, these books are the most valuable books in the world today for theEnglish-language student of Kabbalah.The books in this series allow readers to eavesdrop on a Kabbalah class thatRabbi Steinsaltz has been teaching for many years in the basement of a synagoguein Jerusalem. His classes were transcribed and edited by the late Yehuda Hanegbiand provide the English-language student with a dazzling opportunity to discoverhow a Kabbalist’s mind works — how it analyzes the Torah text, how it speculateson the nature of life itself, and how it shares the wisdom of the ages.These books are unique; there’s nothing like them in the English language.They’re Kabbalistic discourses taught by an extraordinarily gifted teacher tostudents who live in a Kabbalistic universe and want to follow the thoughts ofone of its most creative and insightful masters.THE TEACHINGS OF RABBI NACHMANRabbi Nachman of Breslov occupies a unique place in the world of Kabbalah. AHasidic rabbi who lived centuries ago, his reputation not only maintained itselfbut grew after his death, prompting a growing movement by his followers, who tothis day relate to Rabbi Nachman as though he were very much alive. Thesefollowers continue his tradition by taking direction from Rabbi Nachman’steachings for their spiritual practices, studying from the texts that teach hiswisdom, and publishing and distributing these teachings to others. TheseKabbalists don’t believe in ghosts or that Rabbi Nachman is hiding in the fleshin this world, but they believe that his words of Kabbalah, his words of Torah,are as alive, as vibrant, and as present as those of any teacher who’sphysically alive.Many of Rabbi Nachman’s teachings were written down by his disciple Rabbi Nathanand are available in many volumes in English. Rabbi Nachman’s focus on thejoyous approach to life is legendary and is reflected in so many of histeachings. Of special note is the famous Tales of Rabbi Nachman, which look likesimple, traditional folktales but are actually rich representations ofKabbalistic ideas regarding the worlds in which we live and the interactions ofthe ten sefirot. These ideas are all represented in a kind of code in thefolktales of Rabbi Nachman.A number of modern commentaries on these stories are available, most notablyfrom Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan and Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz. In a volume originallypublished with the title Beggars and Prayers but later reprinted as the Tales ofRabbi Nachman, Rabbi Steinsaltz offers a fascinating Kabbalistic commentary onseveral of Rabbi Nachman’s major tales. He clearly illustrates that although thefolk stories are populated by kings, princes, princesses, and simple folk,they’re actually profound transmissions of Kabbalistic wisdom."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14HITTING THE BOOKS — AND KISSING THEM: STUDYING LIKE A KABBALISTIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Recognizing the power of daily studybullet [Images/arrow.png] Studying Kabbalah in different languagesbullet [Images/arrow.png] Working with spiritual teachers and study partnersbullet [Images/arrow.png] Grasping the true nature of Torah and Talmud studyEven though you can take an introductory class in Kabbalah anywhere in the worldthese days, taking a class doesn’t make you a Kabbalist. Being a Kabbalist meansmaking a lifelong commitment to learning and practicing. Kabbalists study —every day. Not almost every day or once in a while, but every day — includingweekends and holidays. Kabbalists don’t have free time because any moment that’s“free” is filled up with study. That’s why Kabbalists almost always have atleast one book of Kabbalah with them at all times. Waiting for a bus? Study.Sitting on the train? Study.But by “studying,” I don’t mean that Kabbalists have to be reading every moment.They may be contemplating the things they’ve been learning lately; they may bethinking about God; or they may be thinking about how to apply their learning tolife. But one way or another, a Kabbalist is always trying to connect withtexts, teachings, and tradition.In this chapter, you explore the importance of study and how to go about doingit. You also find out what makes a good Kabbalah teacher and how to find one.Finally, you look at the unique ways a Kabbalist studies the Bible and otherKabbalistic texts.WHEN KABBALISTS HIT THE BOOKS, THEY REALLY HIT THEM!I’ll never forget the first time I saw Kabbalists learning. I was in a yeshiva(yeh-she -vah; school of Torah study) in the Old City of Jerusalem, and I walkedinto a study hall full of long, narrow tables. Students were sitting on bothsides of the tables, some by themselves in front of open books, some in pairs,and some in groups of three or four.The remarkable thing was the way in which they learned. Their holy books were infront of them, and physically they related to these books in two ways:bullet [Images/check.png] They kissed them.bullet [Images/check.png] They hit them.Many times throughout the study session, I witnessed students gently liftingtheir books to their mouths as they kissed them with affection and gratitude. Itisn’t unusual for a student of Kabbalah to encounter a dazzling piece of wisdomon the page that prompts him or her to lift the book and kiss it with gratitudefor the enlightenment the text has offered.But I also saw the opposite, or the apparent opposite. Students of Torah oftenhit pages of their books with their hands. Why? Sometimes a student getsinvolved in a discussion or a debate recorded in a sacred text and ends upobjecting to a point of view reported in the text. At times such as these, it’snot only acceptable but actually even encouraged to get so emotionally involvedin the discussion or debate on the page that you hit the page as if to say, “Idisagree!”In Kabbalistic tradition, hitting a page of text shows no disrespect for thesacred book or tradition. On the contrary, one is required to get emotionallyinvolved with what one studies. For the Kabbalist, studying and learning aren’tpassive activities in which one simply opens one’s brain and has informationpoured into it. Rather, dialogue, questions, objections, and sometimes deepemotion are what make a student entangled (in the best sense of the word) inwhat he or she is learning.UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDY IN KABBALAHTo think that Kabbalah is a body of knowledge that you can master is a hugemistake. Kabbalah requires constant and ongoing study, and mastering Kabbalahjust isn’t possible. In this section, I share with you just how and why study issuch an essential part of the life of a Kabbalist.Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]When a Kabbalist wants to spend time with a holy or sacred text, he or shegenerally says, “I’m going to learn,” not, “I’m going to study.” This may seemlike an issue of semantics, but there’s an important distinction between the twophrases. Study implies an outward thrust, to go to material, to wrestle with it,to grasp it, and to absorb it. Learn has a different feel to it; it implies anopening of oneself, a basic humility that recognizes a need. When you study, yougo out to get information; when you learn, you open and receive information.RECEIVING AN ONGOING BENEFITStudying is like going to the gym. Just like short, regular visits to the gymare more effective than going once a week for a long session, studying brieflybut regularly is better than studying for one long session and then not gettingback to it for a while.As well, just as exercise is only beneficial if you keep doing it, studying onlyworks if you keep at it. You can exercise and get into tiptop shape, trimmingaway the fat and building up muscle definition, but as soon as you stopexercising, the fruits of your labor begin to deteriorate immediately. The sameholds true for studying Kabbalah. One needs to review and understand theprinciples of Kabbalah on a regular basis. For the Kabbalist, study isn’t amatter of learning a curriculum and then feeling that “I’ve done it, and I’velearned it.”FIGHTING THE TENDENCY TO FORGETAn interesting aspect of Kabbalah study has to do with the tendency people haveto forget much of what they learn. This kind of forgetfulness is common whenyou’re dealing with technical information, but it’s even more common withgeneral wisdom. Kabbalists are required to study every day to meet the need forconstant reminders and review. For the Kabbalist, study is as routine andessential as the most basic bodily functions. One eats every day, one sleepsevery day, and one studies every day.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]Regarding the tendency to forget, one of my Kabbalah teachers taught me thatforgetting something that was learned isn’t necessarily a loss. Learning a newidea produces a change in one’s consciousness and whole being. The mind andconsciousness adjust themselves, integrating the new idea into one’s being. Thebrain, its memory, and its ability to grasp and understand things move in orderto fit in the new idea into the whole. Therefore, if and when one forgetssomething, it isn’t really a loss because the adjustment and integration of thenew idea has already taken place. Nonetheless, Kabbalists study every day, 365days a year.USING STUDY TO TALK TO GODKabbalah teaches that when the Children of Israel stood at Mount Sinai toreceive the Torah, a divine transmission occurred: God did the teaching, and theChildren of Israel did the receiving. The result in its written form is theTorah, the Five Books of Moses.Torah study for the Kabbalist is really a conversation between God and humans.It’s a partnership whereby God and humankind join forces in order to solve theriddle of existence.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]According to my teacher, all subsequent holy books produced by the Children ofIsrael and their descendents reflect a dialogue. Torah study is an effort on thepart of humankind to respond to the Torah received at Mount Sinai.WHERE AND WHEN DO I BEGIN?WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]An ancient text studied by Kabbalists records the advice of Rabbi Judah benTeima on the question of what texts a person should study and at what age: “Atfive years (the age is reached for the study of the) Scripture, at ten for (thestudy of) the Mishnah, at thirteen for (the fulfillment of) the commandments, atfifteen for (the study of) the Talmud.”These guidelines aren’t hard and fast rules, however. Some children have thecapacity to begin Torah study earlier than age 5, and there are so many levelsof study that one 5-year-old can begin to learn the stories in the Bible whileanother child pierces deeper. But the following curriculum from Rabbi Judah benTeima makes a lot of sense and continues to be a good guide:1. At age 5, begin with the Holy Scriptures (Tanakh: the Five Books of Moses,the Prophets, and the Writings; see Chapter 13).The Holy Scriptures is the foundation of all Kabbalah learning and is absolutelyessential for serious Kabbalists.2. At age 10, study the Mishnah, which is the written record of the ancient oraltradition, as old as the Torah itself (see Chapter 13).3. At age 13, proceed to study the commandments, Jewish law.The age of 13 is advised for this study because it’s the age of the bar mitzvahand bat mitzvah, when a young person becomes responsible for his or her ownactions (see Chapter 12).4. At age 15, study Talmud (see Chapter 13).It’s important to understand that the actual document called the Talmud didn’texist when Rabbi Judah ben Teima offered this curriculum advice. The term“Talmud” means “learning” but specifically means the learning of the abstractideas at the heart of the study of Torah. This includes Kabbalah, which is theultimate body of spiritual ideas and concepts in Jewish tradition.Mastering or completing any of these stages is impossible; Kabbalists study themall over and over again throughout their entire lives. And one can certainlyswitch back and forth among these texts and ideas. But these four areas of Torahstudy form a structure, like a building, from the ground floor up. It’spractically impossible to study the Mishnah or the commandments without beingfamiliar with the Holy Scriptures, and the study of Kabbalah is similarly almostimpossible without a solid grounding in the Holy Scriptures, the Mishnah, andthe commandments.STUDYING THE TORAH IN ONE YEARThe Five Books of Moses is divided up into weekly portions that make it possibleto spend one complete year studying the whole thing from beginning to end. Thecycle begins and ends on the holy day of Simchat Torah (see Chapter 11).In every synagogue throughout the world, the same portion of the Torah is readaloud on the Sabbath. Each of the portions has a name, as listed here. The listalso tells you where the portions can be found in the Torah:1. Bereshit (buh-ray-sheet; book of Genesis)1. Bereshit Genesis 1–6:82. Noach Genesis 6:9–11:323. Lech Lecha Genesis 12–17:274. Vayyera Genesis 18–225. Chayye Sarah Genesis 23–25:186. Toledot Genesis 25:19–28:97. Vayyetze Genesis 28:10–32:38.

Balak Numbers 22:2–25:98. Pinchas Numbers 25:10–30:19. Mattot Numbers 30:2–3210. Massey Numbers 33–365. Devarim (deh-vah-reem; book of Deuteronomy)1. Devarim Deuteronomy 1–3:222. Va-ethchanan Deuteronomy 3:23–7:113. Ekev Deuteronomy 7:12-11:254. Re’eh Deuteronomy 11:26–16:175. Shofetim Deuteronomy 16:18–21:96. Ki Thetze Deuteronomy 21:10–257. Ki Thavo Deuteronomy 26–29:88. Itzavim Deuteronomy 29:9–309. Vayyelech Deuteronomy 3110. Haazinu Deuteronomy 3211. Vesoth Ha-Berachah Deuteronomy 33–34Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]If you do an Internet search for any of the names of the Torah portions listedhere, you’ll find many commentaries by a wide range of rabbis and teachers. EachTorah portion is rich and deep, and each can be studied endlessly, so by lookingat a portion a week, year after year, students of Torah are able to make lots ofprogress.STUDYING THE MISHNAH IN ONE YEARA system has been devised to get students through the six sections of theMishnah in a year by studying two paragraphs each day. This study plan is calledMishnah Yomi (mish -nah yo -mee; daily Mishnah). Studying the Mishnah in oneyear doesn’t mean mastering it; you can go deeper and deeper, but Mishnah Yomiis a good start.Most people who study the Mishnah go at their own pace, but using the dailysystem can be useful. Type “Mishnah Yomi” into your favorite Internet searchengine to find instructions for studying the Mishnah in Hebrew (the originallanguage), English, and many other languages. And any good Jewish bookstore isbound to sell various commentaries on the Mishnah in English.STUDYING THE TALMUD IN 7 1/2 YEARSThe Talmud is huge; it has 63 sections, some of which are as long as many books.The system Daf Yomi (dahf yo -mee; a page a day) helps Kabbalah students tacklethe Talmud by guiding them through it one page each day for about 7 1/2 years.Daf Yomi is used worldwide by thousands of students and even offers phonenumbers that students can call to hear a summary recording of the day’s page.Not everyone who studies the Talmud goes through a page a day. For some, evenone page (they’re big pages) per day is a lot, but for others, a page a day isan easy feat. Each person who studies the Talmud goes at his or her own pace. Aswith every other sacred text, there’s no end to the depths to which a studentcan go.STUDYING KABBALAH: WHERE AND WHEN DO YOU BEGIN?A popular misconception about the study of Kabbalah claims that one must be 40years old in order to study it (see Chapter 17). That isn’t a rule, but just asyou wouldn’t study calculus before arithmetic, you really can’t study Kabbalahuntil you have a lot of basic Torah, Mishnah, and Talmud study under your belt.My three children (two girls and a boy) attended tradition Jewish schools andoften came home with Kabbalistic ideas on their lips, eager to share them withme. In fact, since my children and I are all direct descendants of one of themost illustrious Kabbalists in history, Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz (see Chapter 18),they were always excited and eager to share when one of their teachers taughtthem some wisdom from one of his holy books of Kabbalah.CAN I STUDY KABBALAH IN ENGLISH? (YOU ALREADY ARE!)Many people hold the point of view that unless you study a holy text in itsoriginal language, you’re not really studying it. I advise you to steer clear ofsuch a view; take it from me, it isn’t true. Misunderstanding a holy textbecause it’s in its original language is a valid risk; one can reap a fargreater understanding of a text after it’s translated. As my teacher oncepointed out, every translation is a commentary, but a commentary isn’t a crutchor a barrier to understanding; it’s a common aid to understanding that everyKabbalist is involved with whenever he or she studies.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]The same issue of translation comes up in the area of prayer. Unfortunately, agreat number of people pray in a language that they can’t understand. The greatsages have taught that, regarding prayer as well as study, there’s little pointin doing it if you don’t understand what you’re doing. So a student shouldn’tget intimidated by people who say that she’s not really studying Kabbalah ifshe’s studying in English.Great experts and practitioners of Kabbalistic tradition have written many booksin many languages. One example is Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz of Jerusalem, who’s amaster of Talmud and Kabbalah and highly revered among rabbis. His works havebeen translated into English, Russian, French, Spanish, Chinese, and Hebrew. Oneof his mottos is “Let my people know,” and he’s devoted much of his life tocreating English-language tools and translations for serious students. His booksare widely available.TRANSLATIONS TO CONSIDERI advise people interested in Kabbalah to seriously investigate varioustranslations of traditional texts. For example, any number of translations ofthe prayers that Kabbalists have recited and studied for centuries areavailable. When tracking down the classical texts, it’s important to be aware ofthe following:bullet [Images/check.png] Torah texts: Any number of translations of the FiveBooks of Moses are available. I prefer The Living Torah by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan(Moznaim), a renowned teacher of Kabbalah and Jewish meditation, but there arelots of others.Warning(bomb) [Images/Warning(bomb).jpg]Kabbalists consider some English translations of the Torah useless, and I tendto agree. For example, you can find translations and commentaries on the Torahwritten and produced by people who don’t believe in divine revelation. If youalso don’t believe in divine revelation, don’t be fooled into thinking that yourbest bet for study is to focus on the work of others who take the same point ofview. Right or wrong, if you want to study Kabbalah, it’s imperative that youstudy translated texts done by individuals who are believers in the traditionand therefore write from the inside.bullet [Images/check.png] The Talmud: The place to start without a doubt is TheTalmud: The Steinsaltz Edition (Random House). Now out-of-print, volumes can befound in synagogue libraries, public libraries, university libraries, andelsewhere. Used copies are also available on popular Web sites that sell usedbooks. Also, the English Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud (Artscroll), whichhas extensive commentaries, is highly recommended, especially for the advancedstudent.bullet [Images/check.png] The Zohar: There two translations of the Zohar inexistence. One is a British translation by Maurice Simon (Soncino) that has beenaround for decades; it has no commentary and is of very limited value to thebeginning student. The other, a clearly written and more accessible Zohartranslation project underway as of this writing, is The Zohar: Pritzker Editionby Daniel Matt (Stanford University Press). Three volumes have appeared as ofthis writing, and the translator projects that there will be ten to twelvevolumes in all — and that it will take him another decade to finish. The generalconsensus seems to be that this translation, while both monumental andgroundbreaking, isn’t useful for the beginner. Daniel Matt has also written TheEssential Kabbalah (HarperCollins), a far more accessible book that I recommend.bullet [Images/check.png] Sefer Bahir and Sefer Yetzirah: These two earlyKabbalistic texts are translated with commentary by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan (WeiserBooks). The late Rabbi Kaplan was an extraordinary scholar and teacher, andthese two books are major contributions to the small but growing collection ofbooks in English of interest to students of Kabbalah.I explore a number of other Kabbalistic texts of importance in Chapter 13.DON’T RULE OUT LEARNING HEBREWAlthough studying holy books in a language that one understands is bothpermissible and obviously advantageous, a Kabbalist would never disregard theultimate value of studying the Torah and other classic texts in their originallanguage of Hebrew. When it comes to the Torah, not only are the literalmeanings of the Hebrew words of the Torah of interest, but also Kabbalists areinterested inbullet [Images/check.png] The shapes of the lettersbullet [Images/check.png] The numerical value of the letters and wordsbullet [Images/check.png] The linguistic roots from which the words are derivedbullet [Images/check.png] Words that have similar soundsbullet [Images/check.png] Words that have similar spellingsbullet [Images/check.png] The spaces between the letters and wordsbullet [Images/check.png] The size of the letters as written in the Torah scrollbullet [Images/check.png] The words that are apparent misspellingsThe original text of the Torah has many levels of meaning, and the seriousstudent explores them all. The original language carries so much meaning that,from experience, students of Kabbalah understand that the more one grasps in theoriginal Hebrew, the more profound the lessons are.Here’s just one small example of how a careful look at Hebrew words can bedelightful and enlightening. The Hebrew word for “community” is tzibor (tzee-boor), which is spelled with three consonants and one vowel. The three Hebrewconsonants are tzadi (tzah -dee), bet (bate), and resh (raysh). Kabbalistictradition teaches that there are three types of people who make up a community:the saint, the sinner, and the intermediate person who struggles with his or hergood and evil urges. The Hebrew word for “saint” is tzaddik (tzah -deek), theHebrew word for “sinner” is rasha (rah -shah), and the Hebrew word for theintermediate person is benoni (bay-no-nee ). The first three letters of each ofthese words make up the word “community.” Countless other examples like this onereflect the amazing nature of Hebrew and the depth of study that a knowledge ofHebrew allows.WHEN THE STUDENT IS READY: FINDING A GOOD TEACHERIn the Kabbalistic tradition, a spiritual teacher, in many ways, has a higherstatus in a person’s life than a parent. Despite the fact that one of the TenCommandments is “Thou shall honor thy father and thy mother,” the traditionalunderstanding of what honoring one’s father and mother means is quite limited,and one’s spiritual teacher has elevated and exalted status in one’s life. Thesages say that natural parents only bring a person into this world; spiritualteachers bring that person into the world to come.If you want to study Kabbalah, it goes without saying that finding a goodteacher when you’re ready is essential. You can’t get far on your journey if youtry to go it alone. It’s never too early to look for a teacher, and there’sactually a law recorded in the Mishnah that everyone is required to find ateacher.Following is some advice regarding the search for a teacher:bullet [Images/check.png] Not all teachers are for everybody. In fact, there’s aKabbalistic belief that various souls in the world are connected to other soulsat their roots, meaning that two people resonate with each other because theirsouls have a root in common. However, people with the same personalities or thesame looks don’t necessarily have souls that share a common root; the matter isdeeper than that.For example, a student can find a teacher who’s quite different in temperamentin personality than the student is, and yet the student can resonate profoundlywith the teacher and derive tremendous benefit from their relationship. If youattend a lecture and quickly decide that you don’t like a certain teacher, Isuggest that you not be hasty in looking for another teacher. With time, thestudent-teacher relationship can grow in profound ways. However, if you don’tultimately love the teacher, then he or she may not be the right one for you. AKabbalah teacher who truly nourishes you is one whom you come to love.bullet [Images/check.png] Don’t think that you have to understand everything ina teacher’s classes in order for it to be a worthwhile experience. In myopinion, people too often treat classes like films or theater and want to beentertained from beginning to end. If a teacher comes highly recommended, Isuggest that you give him or her a chance — or more. You may sit in a class fortwo hours and find most of it boring except for the one sentence that strikes achord and that just may change your life.For a few years, I attended a Kabbalist’s lectures once a week for two hours,during which this great man taught 12 of us sitting in his apartment. Oneadvanced student in the class seemed to be able to grasp and record every wordthat the teacher said. I, on the other hand, was a beginner, and some weeks thatwent by when I only “got” one idea in the whole two-hour meeting. I sometimesfelt like I was in the wrong class. However, looking back 20 years, I realizethat I learned more from those classes than I thought, and some of the ideasthat I picked up along the way are among the most important and profound of allmy studies.bullet [Images/check.png] Don’t be impressed by titles. A person may have threePhDs, ordination, and be the author of a dozen books and yet have very little toteach. But a more modest individual with no official credentials can offerprofound insight into a subject. Too often, teachers are criticized for having“the wrong institutional affiliation.” My advice is to look beyond thesesuperficial designations. Usually, when you find your teacher, you know it, andthe other stuff doesn’t matter.bullet [Images/check.png] Avoid teachers who think that they know everything. Ateacher who says, “I don’t know” has at least one very attractive attribute:humility. In my experience, the modest teacher is usually the finer teacher.PAIRING WITH A STUDY BUDDYA chevrusa (khehv-roo -sah; study partner) is highly recommended for Kabbalahstudents. The study partner relationship is a very close, intimate, andimportant one. I remember when I was studying in Jerusalem in a traditionalyeshiva, and my class was exploring some of the basic ideas of Kabbalah in asmall classroom in the Old City. After one particular class, the other studentsleft, but I stayed behind and chatted with the teacher. A few minutes into ourconversation, his own study partner, with whom he’d studied Kabbalah for years,came into the classroom. Both of their faces shone as they looked at each otherwith the great enthusiasm that came from meeting each day in the sublime realmsof Torah study.It’s too easy for a student to fool herself into thinking that she understandswhat she’s studying. A study partner can prevent that self-deception fromoccurring. In addition, study partners often challenge each other and evokefurther consideration and discussion; as the sages described, “When two peoplestudy together, they sharpen each other’s blades.”Another advantage to having a study partner is that he or she is an addedsupport for regular study. A student may try to study every night for half anhour, but if she has a partner who’s relying on her, she’s more likely to stickto a regular study rhythm and schedule.Finding a study partner can be as easy as meeting someone in a class or inpassing who shares an interest in exploring the profound ideas of Kabbalistictradition. Establishing a study partnership often takes no more than a simpleinquiry. When two people agree to be study partners, all that’s left to do isobtain two copies of a book, set a regular time, and start reading it together.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]It’s important that study partners want to study with the same frequency andshare a seriousness about their commitment to studying Kabbalah.Study partners may read a book sentence by sentence or paragraph by paragraphand then try to express and share what the text means before moving on to thenext sentence or paragraph. Sharing understanding, insights, and freeassociations enriches both individuals. On the physical plane of existence, twoindividuals can join together and give birth to a new baby. In much the sameway, two ideas can join together and “give birth” to a new idea. That new ideamay never have occurred to either of the study partners individually, but theirshared ideas can attach themselves to or get entangled with each other andultimately produce a new and even deeper idea.STUDYING ANCIENT SCRIPTURE: THE TORAHKabbalists believe that there was a time in history when Moses ascended MountSinai and received the Torah from God. They also believe that the giving of theTorah at Mount Sinai is an eternal event that takes place constantly; Kabbalistsbelieve that one can place oneself at Mount Sinai and listen to the giving ofthe Torah at any given moment.By studying classical Kabbalistic texts, all of which ultimately connect withthe primary transmission of the Torah at Mount Sinai, one is, in a way, standingat Mount Sinai. The ancient texts are portals into a timeless realm where theancient texts come alive and the student resides in the eternal present.In order to study the holy texts properly, Kabbalists need to be familiar withthe details in the Bible, including the basic stories and their main characters.There comes a point, as reported by all Kabbalists, when the serious studentexperiences these biblical characters as alive, real, and in the present.The Torah is the most important text for every Kabbalist and any student whowants to walk the Kabbalistic path. The Torah is embedded with all of life’swisdom — sometimes explicit and sometimes hidden and just waiting to berevealed.Kabbalists consider the Torah to be the blueprint of the world. In fact, they’velong pondered a statement claiming that God looked into the Torah and createdthe world. This belief implies that that the Torah is the basic root structureof everything. (For further explanation of the Torah, see Chapter 13.)Every week, Kabbalists intensely study a portion of the Torah along withcommentaries on those portions. The following sections walk you through elementsof the Torah study process.THE SECRETS HIDDEN IN THE STORY OF CREATIONKabbalists study the words that describe the creation of the world in greatdetail in order to glimpse the secrets of the workings of creation. Lookingclosely at this first book of the Torah has been a common one among Kabbalists.The effort to examine the book of Bereyshit (ber-ray-sheet; Genesis),particularly the creation story at the beginning, is referred to as ma’asehB’reyshit (mah-ah-seh ber-ray-sheet; the work of creation). The lines in thestory of creation that are of particular interest in ma’aseh B’reyshit are thefollowing:bullet [Images/check.png] In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.bullet [Images/check.png] And the earth was without form, and void; and darknesswas upon the face of the deep. And a wind from God moved upon the face of thewaters.bullet [Images/check.png] And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.bullet [Images/check.png] And God saw the light, that it was good; and Goddivided the light from the darkness.bullet [Images/check.png] And God called the light Day, and the darkness hecalled Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.What makes these lines so intriguing for Kabbalists? Here are a few explorationsthat help explain the interest:bullet [Images/check.png] The Torah describes the universe before God said “Letthere be light” as tohu b’vohu (toe-hoo beh-vo-who; without form and empty[Genesis 1:1]). Kabbalists see these words as technical Kabbalistic terms thatallude to something that’s sometimes referred to as divine nothingness. Theprocess of going from formless to form is a deep concept in Kabbalah.bullet [Images/check.png] The phrase “darkness was on the face of the deep”(Genesis 1:2) intrigues the Kabbalist because it’s rich with meaning. Thesewords are used in the same way that cosmologists attempt to find words todescribe the origins of the universe.bullet [Images/check.png] The use of the word “light” in the phrase “Let therebe light” has profound meaning as well. According to the biblical story, the sunand stars weren’t yet created when God said “Let there be light,” so Kabbalistsdon’t understand what’s meant by the text.THERE MUST BE 70 WAYS TO UNDERSTAND THE TORAHThe number 70 is a significant number in Kabbalah. The Torah itself speaks ofthe 70 nations of the world, a basic unit of 70 parts that together constitutethe whole; also, the Torah contains 70 different facets, or rays of divine lightthat are reflected in the text.The Torah is unlike any other document in that it has multitudes of meanings.After all, Kabbalists conceive of God as infinite and understand that the Torahis a transmission of divine wisdom from above. Therefore, the Torah, too, is areflection of the infinite. There’s no one proper interpretation of any giventext, word, phrase, sentence, or story in the Torah. The Torah text has manylayers, and each layer can be peeled back to reveal dazzling images and ideashidden within the holy text.Warning(bomb) [Images/Warning(bomb).jpg]Does this mean that any and every interpretation is proper? Certainly not. Justbecause Kabbalists believe in a tremendous number of levels of meaning in theTorah doesn’t mean that Torah study is a free-for-all where everybody’s point ofview is equally sound. The possibility for interpretation is one of theimportant reasons behind finding a teacher who, on the simplest level, can pointout a basic mistranslation or misunderstanding.FINDING ONE’S PRIVATE GATE IN THE TORAHSome Kabbalists teach that there aren’t 70 aspects to the Torah (see thepreceding section) but rather a whopping 600,000 aspects that correspond to the600,000 primary souls said to have stood at Mount Sinai for the originalrevelation. Some Kabbalists interpret this as referring to the idea that thereare many gates to use to enter into the world of Torah and that each of person,as one of his or her important tasks in life, is to find his or her “privategate.”Torah study isn’t a free-for-all in which one can go in any direction one likes.Nonetheless, a great emphasis is placed on individuality. In fact, a specialcategory of Torah interpretation called chidush (khih -doosh) implies a novel,new, unique perspective expressed by an individual who has been privileged toreveal still another dazzling part of the Torah. No two individuals understandthe Torah in precisely the same way — nor do they have to. A basic assumption ofTorah explication is that there can many simultaneous yet differentinterpretations of the Torah, and all can be “right.” The Torah has, bydefinition, many levels.THE FOUR LEVELS OF TORAH STUDYKabbalists relate entering the world of Torah study to entering a garden ororchard: The Kabbalist enters into the orchard of Torah study and discovers itsvarious levels of meaning. The Hebrew word for “orchard” is pardes (par-days ).In Hebrew, this word consists of four letters, and each of the four lettersstands for one of the four basic Kabbalistic approaches to Torah study. Thepardes becomes an acronym that reminds Kabbalists of these four approaches:bullet [Images/check.png] The literal meaning: The first letter word of the word“pardes” is the Hebrew letter pey, which stands for the Hebrew word p’shat(puh-shot). P’shat indicates the literal meaning of the text. In other words,the Bible openly reveals a basic storyline at the clearest of levels.The word “p’shat” is used in modern conversation to refer to the literal natureof understanding. For example, two Kabbalists meet on the street, and one saysto the other, “Did you go to the gathering last night?” The other person says,“Yes,” and the questioner asks for a description of what happened at thegathering. The person in attendance begins to give all kinds of details,opinions, observations, and perspectives about the gathering when all thequestioner really wants is a basic outline of what happened at the gathering. Hesays, “I don’t want all of your extra observations. Just give me the p’shat.”bullet [Images/check.png] The hint: The second level of Torah analysis andexplication is known as remez (reh-mez). This term indicates not what a versesays but what it implies or hints at.bullet [Images/check.png] The moral: The third level of Torah explication isdrash (drahsh). It focuses on neither what the verse says nor what the versehints at but rather what lesson one can learn from the text.bullet [Images/check.png] The secret: The last of the four general levels ofTorah analysis is sod (sowd). The sod level is the deepest, most esotericunderstanding of the Torah. This level is the most abstract level, when thedetails of the Torah are highly symbolic. For example, when the Torah speaks ofAbraham and Isaac, the sod level can see Abraham as the personification of thesefirah of Chesed and Isaac as the personification of the sefirah of Gevurah(see Chapter 4 for explanations of these two important Kabbalistic terms).People often mistakenly think that sod is the Kabbalistic level of Torahanalysis, but a Kabbalist is interested in all four levels and theirrelationship to each other. The personalities of sacred texts (the Bible, theFive Books of Moses, the Prophets, and the Writings) become archetypes forKabbalists, representing far more than historical characters.DISCUSSING LIFE’S ISSUES WITH THE SAGES: THE TALMUDFor the last few thousand years, Kabbalists have been involved in an ongoingdiscussion that began many centuries ago among the great sages of Jewishhistory. This ongoing discussion began with the compiling and editing of theTalmud, which is a written recording of various explorations on a wide range oftopics by the sages. (For more on the Talmud, check out Chapter 15.)FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my teachers taught me that if the Torah is God speaking to man, theTalmud is man speaking to God. It’s essential that the student of Talmudparticipate actively in its study.Talmud study isn’t a passive activity in which the student opens himself up andreceives wisdom or information. Rather, the study of Talmud engages thestudent’s mind and emotions. Talmud study requires the student to probe, askquestions, object to ideas, and to generally get entangled with the text. It’sbeen said that the act of studying the Talmud is actually God and man joiningforces as they both continue to create the world.Kabbalistic ideas appear regularly throughout the 63 volumes of the Talmud, butthey usually are never explicitly stated. The student of Talmud must make aneffort to understand the text and then break it open to find the eternal ideasembedded within the text. A simple parable can actually contain profound andlife-changing notions. When read simply as a story, the lesson may not presentitself, but when one knows that the great sages communicated some of their mostprofound ideas through stories, parables, and even laws, then the study ofTalmud is transformed into an inquiry into the most meaningful ideas, concepts,and principles of life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15PRAYING LIKE A KABBALISTIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Finding the focal point of Kabbalistic prayerbullet [Images/arrow.png] Mastering the proper inner attitudesbullet [Images/arrow.png] Checking out the essential ingredients of dailyKabbalistic prayerOne of the biggest stumbling blocks that people face regarding prayer is thequestion of why God, who is vast beyond all vastness and the Creator of theuniverse, would be interested or would even care to listen to the prayers of asingle individual who’s no more than a tiny speck within creation. After all, ifnobody’s listening, why bother talking? It’s tempting to abandon the wholeprocess.Many people pray based on habit and upbringing; they’ve seen their parents andgrandparents pray, and like them, they go to houses of worship either routinelyor on and off all their lives. And even during home rituals, many people recitethe words of prayers because it’s something they’ve always done, not becausethey actually believe their prayers are effective or even heard. Some peopledon’t even understand the words of the prayers they recite!But none of this is true for a Kabbalist. A Kabbalist prays in fullconsciousness and prays to a God who he knows is always listening and alwaysresponding. (Someone once aptly said, “God answers all of my prayers, but oftenthe answer is ‘No.’”) When the Kabbalist prays, it’s his soul that’s praying.This chapter offers the Kabbalistic answer to the question “Why pray?” andaddresses the essential elements, both the content as well as the spiritualqualities, that people need if they want to pray as Kabbalists pray. I alsoexplain the techniques that Kabbalists use to pray properly, with genuineunderstanding and feeling.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The two Hebrew words that are often used in reference to Kabbalistic prayer arebullet [Images/check.png] Tefillah (teh-fee-lah; prayer)bullet [Images/check.png] Avodah (ah-voe-dah; work or service)It’s interesting to note that, in Kabbalistic tradition, prayer is referred toas the “avodah of the heart.”AN OVERVIEW OF PRAYER IN THE LIFE OF A KABBALISTIf you were to ask a Kabbalist, “When do you pray?”, he’d probably give you twoanswers: “I try to pray three times each day,” and “I pray all the time.”The Kabbalistic take on prayer is that the soul is constantly praying. Accordingto Kabbalists, in its most profound depths, the soul is part of God, and theKabbalist’s job is to raise his consciousness to the level at which he’s awareof the connection humans have with God. In order to raise one’s consciousness,prayer must happen constantly. The Kabbalist may be distracted at times, but atany moment, he can focus on the reality of his connection to the Almighty.For some, prayer is easy and uncomplicated. A person for whom God is and mayalways have been a reality simply opens up and prays, offering words ofgratitude and praise and making requests of God with the utmost sincerity. ForKabbalists (both those who have received this gift of the ability to offerprayers with full devotion as well as those who struggle with prayer), prayerrequires preparation and intellectual understanding. The struggle that many havewith prayer isn’t a stumbling block for the Kabbalist who sees that struggle aspart of the process of genuine prayer.To pray as a Kabbalist ideally prays takes time. Sometimes years of training andpreparation are necessary to achieve the kind of prayer that ultimately servesone for the rest of one’s life. Children begin this process early in life, bymastering both the traditional prayer format as found in the traditional prayerbook as well as the ability to maintain the kind of prolonged concentration thatKabbalistic prayer requires. The ultimate goal goes far beyond the intellectualunderstanding of the prayers in the prayer book or the faith that God islistening. A Kabbalist masters prayer when he or she doesn’t recite the wordsbut actually becomes the words; the words become an expression of the personreciting them.FOLLOWING ROADS TO EFFECTIVE PRAYERFromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]My teacher, a master of Kabbalah, suggests the following three methods to helpattain an effective level of prayer:bullet [Images/check.png] Studying: Regular study of holy texts and theircommentaries (see Chapter 14) puts God on one’s mind and in one’s heart at alltimes. When a student of Kabbalah works hard to understand what it is that Godwants of him or her, and when the student meditates and concentrates in order togo in the direction of grasping God and finding out what it means to increaseone’s knowledge of God, he or she is enveloped and filled with a consciousnessof the Divine.Many Kabbalists make studying before each formal prayer session a regularpractice. Remember that for the Kabbalist, the study of traditional holy textsis a real dialogue with the Almighty. With great effort, concentration, and hardwork during study, God is no longer just a word or a spiritual concept. Godbecomes real, and the student finds that he or she is actually standing beforeGod.bullet [Images/check.png] Struggling with the prayer book: This method isn’tused before prayer but rather during prayer. The prayer book is full of words,concepts, and images that reflect a wide range of emotions and ideas. Too manypeople who pray try to keep up with the prayer leader and attempt to reciteevery word as though the prayers were some kind of magical formula. In a houseof worship where Kabbalists pray, you can see that even though a prayer leaderkeeps up the pace and covers it all, the participants proceed at their ownspeed, often focusing on one word, one image, or one prayer; they struggle withit, trying to grasp it from all sides and hoping to squeeze it and drink itsmeaning.One of the great stumbling blocks of prayer is that people are easily distractedwhile praying. Jewish tradition actually refers to prayer as a rime of battle.The battle is with a mind that frequently jumps from thought to thought.Prolonged concentration takes a lot of work and training and sometimes resultsin utter failure. But Kabbalists report that, through devoted attention andimmense effort, one makes progress and achieves the inner ability to piercethrough the words to reach a deep understanding with sustained concentration.bullet [Images/check.png] Meditating on God: Like studying, this method occursbefore a prayer session. An ancient text familiar to Kabbalists says, “The earlyHasidim would set aside an hour and then pray, so that they would turn theirhearts to God.” Similar to study, this meditation is a preparation for prayer,but the activity isn’t one of focusing on a text. Rather, meditation on God isan inner contemplation and the use of one’s mind and heart in an effort totransform one’s whole being into someone who stands before God.Although, by definition, God is beyond humans’ complete grasp, meditation on Godand trying to conceive of the inconceivable (see Chapter 16 for more aboutknowing the unknowable God) brings the Kabbalist to the point where he or she isready to stand before God in prayer.FOUR KINDS OF PRAYERSo Kabbalists can pray all day, either out loud or silently in their minds andhearts. Kabbalists connect with God in prayer in the following ways:bullet [Images/check.png] Spontaneous prayer: In spontaneous prayer, aKabbalist, usually by himself or herself at home or in a quiet place (the forestor a quiet neighborhood road, for example) speaks from the heartconversationally, out loud, and directly to the Almighty. This kind ofspontaneous prayer has been a common practice among Kabbalists for centuries.bullet [Images/check.png] Brachot (blessings): Every moment of the day is anopportunity to recite a blessing. Kabbalists recite specially formulatedblessings for almost every divine gift that they receive, be it food or goodhealth, and they recite blessings for many other categories of human experienceas well.“AMEN” IS LIKE A BASEBALL RBIKabbalistic teachings include the idea that, if someone is present when someoneelse grabs an opportunity to connect with the Almighty, the listener can jointhat opportunity and take a moment to also acknowledge the presence of theCreator and His divine gifts. This acknowledgment is made by saying “Amen”(aw-mayn) after a blessing is spoken. Saying “amen” to a blessing is likehitting a baseball and getting to first base and sending someone on second baseto home plate. In baseball, it’s called an RBI (run batted in). The batter onsecond base scores, but he couldn’t have done it without the batter who hit thesingle. The sages say that the “amen” response to a blessing ensures that theblessing arrives at its destination.One teaching says that the “amen” response to a blessing has a special qualityto it that’s perhaps even deeper than the quality achieved by the blessingitself.Custom teaches that the word “amen” is spoken at the same volume that theblessing was said (don’t shout out “amen” if someone whispers a blessing;rather, whisper the “amen,” trying to achieve equilibrium with the blessing).As for the logistics of responding to a blessing, one should wait until ablessing is entirely finished before saying “amen.” Responding before the lastwords of the standard blessing are spoken muffles the blessing. Also, “amen”should be spoken at the same volume that the blessing was said to achieveequilibrium with the blessing.bullet [Images/check.png] Standing before the King of Kings of Kings: Threetimes each day (morning, afternoon, and evening), Kabbalists take an opportunityto imagine themselves standing before God in private, earnest prayer. For over2,000 years, the recitation of the same set of prayers, collectively known as“The Prayer,” has afforded the opportunity to have three unique experiences eachday during which the Kabbalist actually believes that he’s standing before theKing of King of Kings and that his prayers are being heard.bullet [Images/check.png] A great declaration of faith: Twice a day (evening andmorning), Kabbalists gather deep concentration and focus on each and every wordof the Sh’ma (sheh-mah), the central prayer of all Jewish tradition (see“Proclaiming the Lord is One” later in this chapter).HOW TO IMAGINE AN UNIMAGINABLE GOD WHILE PRAYINGKabbalists conceive of God as infinite. One of the implications of this conceptis that, in relation to the infinite, everything is of the same proportion. Themovement of your little finger is no less significant than the largestcatastrophe. You see a difference between a little flower in your front yard andthe largest redwood tree in Northern California, but God views both as the samesize. This idea may be difficult to grasp, but it’s fundamental to theKabbalist’s conception of God as infinite.GOD WORKS IN EVERY DEPARTMENTIndividuals who wonder about the efficacy of prayer often stumble over the falsenotion that God has better things to do than listen to the words of one of histiny creatures. If the CEO of a large corporation doesn’t even know the name ofa clerk somewhere in his company, why would God, who is the CEO of the universe,be aware of each individual? Well, Kabbalists don’t view God as a CEO. They viewGod as being everywhere and as a part of everything. Basically, God is equallynear to everything that exists.To a Kabbalist, God isn’t a thing, a supreme being, a spiritual force, or a kingon a throne, and God isn’t in the heavens or somewhere else. Kabbalistsunderstand the human temptation to objectify and limit God, so one Kabbalistictechnique is to constantly reject one’s limited notions and conceptions of God,lifting one’s notion of God to greater and greater heights.KNOWING BEFORE WHOM YOU STANDIn many synagogues throughout the world, the Hebrew expression Dah lifnay meattah omed (dah lif-nay mee ah-tah oh-maid; Know before whom you stand) isposted in the sanctuary. In the synagogue, this phrase helps to maintaindecorum. Too often, people who go into the sanctuary of a synagogue and pray aredistracted by conversations about mundane matters; they’re unable to attend tothe business of prayer. The expression Dah lifnay me attah omed serves as areminder that, when in the sanctuary, the business at hand is the holy act ofpraying to the creator.Kabbalists are always conscious of the meaning behind the phrase Dah lifnay meattah omed, and its significance goes beyond the sanctuary. Kabbalists standbefore God not just in the sanctuary of the synagogue but rather everywhere,including in the bedroom, the kitchen, and the marketplace.SHEDDING CONCEPTIONS OF GODFromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my Kabbalah teachers once told me that being Jewish is difficult for manyreasons, one of which being that Jewish tradition (and, in turn, Kabbalistictradition) asks the participant to establish a personal relationship with a Godthat can’t be conceived of. For the Kabbalist, an almost constant spiritualactivity is the rejection of any limited conception of God whatsoever. You couldeven say that if you have a clear conception of God, one thing is sure: You’rewrong.Any image of God or conception of God can be described in finite terms, which iscategorically forbidden for the Kabbalist. This point is codified most clearlyin the Ten Commandments, where the second commandment reads: “Thou shall make nograven images.” In some ways, the life of a Kabbalist is a continual rejectionof previous conceptions of the Divine and an attempt to conceive of God inincreasingly abstract and infinite ways. One Kabbalistic reference to the Divineis the phrase Ein Sof (ayn sowf), which implies infinity beyond all infinities.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalists don’t pray to any kind of image, either physical or in one’s mind.Kabbalists surely don’t imagine God to be an old man with a beard on a throneholding a scepter, and they avoid any other such anthropomorphic notions of God.Avoiding images of God is particularly difficult because the Torah continuallydescribes God in seemingly anthropomorphic terms. Kabbalists read of God’semotions and, even more concretely, God’s anatomy, as in the image of God takingthe Children of Israel out of Egypt with “an outstretched arm.” But God doesn’thave an arm, let alone an outstretched one, because conceiving of God in anyphysical terms whatsoever is strictly forbidden to Kabbalists. Theanthropomorphic images in the Torah and the other holy writings are merely a wayto communicate sublime ideas in terms that humans can understand.Kabbalists believe that every detail of the human form is actually divinerevelation. But even though the Scriptures describe God most often in physicalhuman terms, Kabbalists know that it’s not only forbidden but alsocounterproductive to imagine God in any form whatsoever. By conceiving of God inincreasingly abstract and nonphysical terms, a clearer apprehension of realitytakes place. This is a kind of built-in function of human consciousness: Whenyou concretize God, reality becomes distorted, but when you push your mind tounderstand that God is beyond all possible images and descriptions, you come toknow God, everything becomes more clear.So the Kabbalist who prays to God has to deal with two seemingly contraryconcepts: On the one hand, she has all the human-like description of God fromthe Torah; on the other hand, she has to discard those concrete images in orderto truly know God. Kabbalists find that, as time goes on and as they directtheir prayers to an inconceivable God, they’re able to establish and develop arelationship with God regardless of how difficult that seems. Kabbalists claimthat one actually comes to the point at which one is with and conscious of Godat all times.ADDRESSING GOD DIRECTLYGod is spoken to directly in Jewish liturgy (the actual words found in worshipservices and standard prayers). Even though a Kabbalist prays to a God thatcan’t be imagined, and even though no words can possibly do God justice, wordsstill need to be used. Two of the most popular terms in Kabbalistic prayers are“You” and “ Our King.”This section examines Kabbalistic blessings and the terms and phrases commonlyfound in them.BREAKING DOWN BASIC BLESSINGSJewish liturgy, which is also the liturgy of the Kabbalist, uses human imageryand down-to-earth terms in an attempt to give expression to one’s deepestthoughts and yearnings. The standard form for dozens of blessings spoken byKabbalists consists of three main phrases:1. Baruch atah (bah-rukh ah-tah; Blessed are You)By using the term “You,” which is a familiar word to all, Kabbalists attempt tomake a direct connection between themselves and God. According to Kabbalistictradition, there are no intermediaries between humans and God; prayers don’tneed to be delivered by a priest, an angel, or any other vehicle.2. Adonai Elohaynu (ah-doe-noy el-oh-hay-new; Lord our God)The meaning behind this phrase is that the vast, inconceivable God is the sameGod who belongs to everyone and who makes Himself manifest in the world in whichhumans live. In other words, this part of a blessing reminds Kabbalists that thevast, infinite God, the inconceivable Lord of the universe, is also near to themand is involved in everything that they do.The word pronounced Adonai is the most sacred form of God’s name; it’s spelledwith the Hebrew letters yud and hey and vav and hey. Known as theTetragrammaton, this form of God’s name, which is related to the Hebrew verb “tobe,” is only vocalized in prayer or when teaching prayer. According totradition, using this name in mundane conversation is forbidden, and speakingthe name at any other time besides prayer — or the teaching of prayer — is usingGod’s name in vain. (For more on the Tetragrammaton, check out Chapter 16.) Theuse of Adonai makes it possible to vocalize what Jewish tradition refers to asthe “ineffable name” of God.3. Melech haOlam (meh-lekh hah-oh-lahm; king of the world or of the universe)Conceiving of God as a king or a ruler certainly brings God down to humanproportion, but Kabbalists still don’t pray to a human king. Rather, they prayto the King of the world.EXPLORING ANOTHER COMMON PHRASE IN KABBALISTIC PRAYEROne of my favorite phrases also found in the liturgy used by Kabbalists ismelech malchay ha-melachim (meh -lekh mahl -khay hahm-lah -kheem; the King ofKings of Kings). To get to the root of this phrase, think of an earthly kingruling over his kingdom in a world in which there are many kingdoms, each ofwhich has a king. Now think of someone who is the head of all those kings — theKing of Kings. But the Kabbalistic God is infinite — not just a king and notjust a king of all kings but rather the King of the King of all Kings. Thisphrase is an attempt, with human language, to push the Kabbalist’s conception ofGod as far as possible.An unusual expression in the liturgy known to Kabbalists for many centuries isAvienu Malkaynu (ah-vee -new mal kay -new). This phrase is a paradox: Avienumeans “our Father,” and Malkaynu means “our King.” Putting the two together begsthe question, “Which is it? Is God our Father or is God our King?”After all, there’s a vast difference between one’s father and one’s king. Afather is familiar; you sit on your father’s lap, you touch your father’s cheek,and you know your father every day. A king, on the other hand, is someone who’salmost never seen. If you live in an actual kingdom with a king, it’s possibleto go your whole life and only glimpse the king just once for just a moment, ifat all.By addressing God as Avienu Malkaynu, Kabbalists attempt to describe somethingindescribable with language. Human language merely points Kabbalists in theright direction, and in this case, Avienu Malkaynu implies that God is both nearand far. This idea helps the Kabbalist to maintain an intimate relationship withGod while acknowledging that God is vast beyond all vastness and is beyond allconception.IS GOD REALLY LISTENING?Kabbalah texts are filled with the notion that God listens to prayers, and theprayers of the great personalities of Jewish tradition are recorded in theBible, a fact that reflects their importance. Kabbalists believe that Godlistens to each and every prayer, but the Kabbalist who prays is caught in aparadox: If God knows everything, if God knows what is, what was, and what willbe, if God knows what one need even before one asks, what is the point ofasking? If God is beyond all time, if God knows the outcome of everything, isn’tthere something absurd about praying for the things one needs?Actually, no. Although God does, in fact, know what the Kabbalist needs, prayeris a means helping the person who prays to figure out what he or she needs. Forexample, if you were asked to give a speech, you would likely prepare for it.You wouldn’t be nearly as prepared and likely wouldn’t say all the things youwanted to say if you just stood up and gave a speech off the top of your headrather than writing down your thoughts and practicing the speech beforehand. Thevery act of putting thoughts into words forms a mirror that allows the person tosee himself or herself more clearly than before.SPEAKING MOST PUBLIC PRAYER IN THE PLURALThe prayers that Kabbalists have recited for centuries, particularly thosespoken in the synagogue, are most often spoken in the first person plural(meaning, “we,” “us,” and “our.”). Pluralized prayer reflects the notion thatthe Children of Israel conceive of themselves as one unit. Many holy booksconvey the notion that all members of the House of Israel are responsible foreach other.Synagogue prayers are central to the Kabbalist’s prayer life and are said incommunity, but private and personal prayer shouldn’t be forgotten. Personalprayers are not only permissible but recommended because each person needs toestablish his or her own personal relationship with “the Lord our God.”The English word for prayer comes from a root that means “to beg,” while theHebrew verb for “to pray” is l’hitpalel (leh hit-pah-lail; to judge oneself).INNER ATTITUDE IS WHAT COUNTSWordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]Kabbalists are aware of the well-known teaching that “Prayer without kavanah islike a body without a soul.” Kavanah (kah-vah-nah ) is a Hebrew term with manylevels of meaning. In regard to prayer, kavanah is inner intention, devotion,concentration, and attention. (For more on kavanah, check out Chapters 9 and16.)PRAYING WITH KAVANAHIn many houses of prayer that I’ve attended throughout the United States, Ioften see people zipping through their prayers at full speed. It hardly seemspossible that these people are reading every word at such a fast speed, but evenif they are, it’s highly unlikely that they’re actually thinking about whatthey’re saying.In addition, in many synagogues, all the prayers are spoken, recited, or sung inthe original Hebrew. Most of the people in the congregation don’t understand aword of what they’re saying, but they believe that they’re fulfilling theirprayer responsibilities just by saying or singing the words in Hebrew.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]INNER INTENTION IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT, IT’S THE LAWThe great Kabbalistic Rabbi Joseph Karo, who lived in the 16th century,indicates in his authoritative code of Jewish law, the Shulchan Aruch, thatkavanah is not only important spiritually but also is a requirement of Jewishlaw.He writes, “The worshiper must inwardly intend the words uttered by his lips,and imagine himself to be in the Divine Presence. He should remove anydisturbing thoughts until his mind and heart are pure and prepared for prayer.He should think that were he standing before a king of flesh and blood, he wouldprepare his words carefully, and address them well in order not to fail in hisattempt, all the more so when he is standing before the King of Kings, Blessedis He, who searches our innermost thoughts.”Nothing could be further from the truth. Prayer is complete only if the personpraying both understands and feels the power and message of the prayer and prayswith kavanah. Simply saying the words — whether it’s too fast to contemplatethem or saying them without understanding them — just doesn’t cut it.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]My teacher explains that, in past generations, people were so steeped intradition that they really didn’t need to understand all of what they weresaying during prayer. The sound of the Hebrew prayers, along with a generalsense of what the prayers were about, carried them through the prayer service.But today, most people who don’t understand Hebrew aren’t well versed enough andreally need to understand the words they recite.When one prays spontaneously, either walking down a road or sitting at home orstrolling through the woods, the prayers are usually heartfelt because they’remade up of the person’s own words and feelings. But a person who prays using aprayer book and recites the words provided must do so with kavanah and withattention to the contents of the prayer in order to make the prayer complete.MOVIN’ ON UP: LEVELS OF KAVANAHKavanah applies throughout the life of a Kabbalist. Every action, from dailychores to the celebration of holy days and the raising of one’s children,requires concentration and refined inner intention. But when it comes to prayer,the entire activity of prayer requires kavanah at every moment.Achieving kavanah is tough, and Kabbalists have identified various levels ofintensity of kavanah over the centuries. Achieving kavanah is essentially aprocess of working through levels.LEVEL 1: SIMPLE UNDERSTANDINGThe great sages insist that a person who’s praying from a prayer book needs tobe able to grasp the words that he or she is saying. Of course, various degreesof intensity are possible even with a simple understanding of prayers. Theamount of time that a person puts into prayer as well as his or herconcentration affect intensity. Reciting a prayer rapidly without much, if any,consciousness or understanding simply can’t provide the same inner intention andconcentration of thought as reciting the same prayer when taking one’s time andputting in greater effort. Quality kavanah is an essential part of prayer.Praying without kavanah would be like making love with your spouse whilethinking of what you’re going to watch on TV later — the lovemaking happens, butit just isn’t the same as it would be with total consciousness.LEVEL 2: IDENTIFICATION WITH THE PRAYERSOn a higher level of kavanah than simply understanding the words is personallyidentifying with the contents of the prayer. With experience, the Kabbalist whoprays notices that the prayers no longer feel external but rather help herexpress her inner emotions. Often, the Kabbalist finds that, over time, theprayer book is simply filled with ways in which she can express herselfthroughout the vast range of human emotions.Over time, Kabbalists also find that they almost completely, if not completely,memorize the contents of the prayer book. Sound impossible? Just think of allthe lyrics to popular music that you can recite from memory. I can easily typeout dozens, if not hundreds, of song lyrics from my favorite artists,particularly Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, and Paul Simon.Knowing these artists’ song lyrics as well as I do, I daresay that I couldprobably relate a favorite song to almost any experience that I have. And so itis with Kabbalists who pray seriously and the prayer book: After mastering thecontents of the prayer book, including its liturgical poems from the MiddleAges, psalms from King David, and standard prayers as developed by the greatsages, the Kabbalist begins to see the prayer book as a personal expression ofher inner feelings; the prayers in the prayer book are no longer just words torecite but rather become a way to give expression to the self.LEVEL 3: MYSTICAL LEVELSKabbalists are taught that, with great amounts of concentration, time, andeffort, one can reach higher levels of consciousness. These higher mysticallevels actually put the soul on a more sublime plane of existence.Some prayer books even introduce what are known as kavanot (kah-vah-note ).These “how to” directions help the one who is praying direct his or herconcentration in the most effective of ways. You can find some of these kavanotin the popular prayer books of today. The most popular Jewish prayer bookavailable today, Classic Artscroll Siddur (Mesorah Publications), includesfrequent kavanot and excellent commentary on just about every prayer (includingkey phrases and verses).Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Prayer without inner intention is empty, and prayer with the proper innerintention can raise the one who prays to a higher level of existence. Kabbalistsdo everything they can to fulfill their obligation to pray daily in the mosteffective and appropriate way possible.KAVANAH: EASIER SAID THAN DONEInner intention is essential in prayer, but it’s difficult to achieve.Kabbalists throughout history have offered plenty of advice to help the personwho prays to achieve the deepest kavanah possible. This section shares some ofthat advice and direction on achieving kavanah in prayer.NO CONVERSATIONSThe custom among Kabbalists when preparing to pray is to abandon all mundaneactivity, especially conversation.Unfortunately, some people view prayer gatherings as social gatherings andopportunities to carry on conversations with each other. Sadly, I’ve sat in toomany synagogues where people behind me were chatting about the news of the dayor discussing real estate prices instead of praying and focusing their heartsand minds on the prayers they were saying or were about to say.The Brooklyn synagogue where I prayed regularly for ten years was a house ofprayer filled with people whose lives were bound up with Kabbalistic tradition.In this synagogue, you’d never hear a conversation in the sanctuary; it simplywasn’t done. Not even in a whisper.NO YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE SANCTUARYOne of my ancestors, Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz (see Chapter 18), taught emphaticallythat young children who don’t have the ability to maintain self-controlshouldn’t be in the sanctuary during prayer. As a Kabbalist, Rabbi Horowitz knewthe requirements for utmost concentration, and the presence of children withoutself-control and the ability to pray on their own can be a major distraction.Similarly, the house of prayer isn’t a place where a family comes and sitstogether as a family unit. In traditional synagogues, men and women sit inseparate sections; boys who can participate in prayer often sit with theirfathers, and girls often sit with their mothers. For the traditional Kabbalist,prayer isn’t a chance for families to bond and sing together. On the contrary,being with one’s family during prayer often offers additional distraction andprevents kavanah.INNER EFFORTThe crux of achieving kavanah, particularly after external distractions areeliminated (see the two preceding sections), is giving it intense inner effort.Just as you can’t go on a diet without actually eating foods with less caloriesand fat, the person who prays can’t really achieve successful prayer withoutactually trying.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]It’s not surprising that one of the words for prayer is avodah (ah-voe -dah),which means “service” and “work.” Prayer is work, and it’s often hard work. Oneof my teachers told me that if a Kabbalist is enjoying himself too much duringprayer, he’s probably doing it wrong.USE EFFECTIVE MELODIESKabbalists have known for centuries that chanting or singing prayers helps tofocus one’s attention on their content. With that in mind, certain melodies arepaired with certain prayers. Melodies also help one to memorize the prayers andto internalize them.LET YOUR TROUBLES GOA Kabbalist faces a paradox when it comes to prayer and personal troubles. Onthe one hand, tradition recommends that he bring his troubles to prayer andexpress them during his prayer time. Yet the great Kabbalists recommend that,when praying, the Kabbalist leave his troubles out of it by offering them to Godin prayer. It’s a tricky process because, on the one hand, part of the point ofprayer is to ask God for help with your troubles. But your troubles shouldn’timpede your ability to express your faith and trust in God.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]How does one reconcile these two approaches that seem to be opposites? One of myteachers compares it to going on a vacation. When you schedule a vacation andtake a trip, you make an effort to leave your work behind and not even thinkabout it. In the same way, the Kabbalist detaches himself from his troubles whenpraying.Prayer requires a great degree of trust and faith in God. It’s as though theperson praying is saying, “God, please listen to my troubles and help me withthem so that they don’t burden me and weigh me down.” Ultimately, trusting thatone can give God one’s troubles and burdens is a major part of the essence ofKabbalistic prayer.AVOID VISUAL DISTRACTIONSThroughout the centuries, Kabbalists didn’t decorate their synagogues or putillustrations of any kind in their prayer books. Many synagogues used byKabbalists didn’t even have windows! People are often startled by the houses ofprayer used by Kabbalists today because they look so drab and simple. Thisvisual effect is a deliberate effort to aid concentration.Most men who are Kabbalists pray with a prayer shawl called a tallis (tah -lis)over their heads. Traditionally, a tallis is made of 100 percent wool, althoughthis isn’t essential. What is essential are the items attached to each of thefour corners of the tallis: The tziztit (tzih -tzeet) are ritual strings knottedin a very particular way to remind the person who prays of the 613 commandmentsfound in the Five Books of Moses. The custom of wearing a tallis with tziztit isbased on a biblical verse (Numbers 15:38). In traditional circles, a tallis isusually worn by a married man, but I’ve seen them used by women and unmarriedmen as well. Covering one’s head with a soft prayer shawl creates a sort ofcocoon that blocks out visual distractions and fosters additional concentration.Upon entering a house of prayer, Kabbalists also try to situate themselves inplaces where they aren’t forced to look at any distracting objects. It’s notunusual to find a Kabbalist praying while facing a bare wall. At the WesternWall in Jerusalem, people pray with their faces almost touching the wall,blocking out all distractions so that they can pray with the deepestconcentration.PRAY WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLEKabbalists shouldn’t pray among people who are unfriendly. When people come topray together, they need to support each other spiritually and help each otherpray.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]One of my Kabbalah teachers calls a gathering of individuals who have cometogether to pray “a circle of dancers.” Along similar lines, the founder of theHasidic movement, the Baal Shem Tov (see Chapter 18), described a gathering ofpeople who pray as “a human ladder,” with each person standing on the shouldersof the other. If any one rung on the ladder is broken, the entire ladder isweakened.THE KABBALIST’S PRAYER BOOKA Kabbalist’s prayer book is known as a siddur (see-door ). The word comes fromthe same root as the Hebrew word seder (say -der), which is the festive meal onthe first day of the holiday of Passover. In both cases, the root word refers toan ordering of things.bullet [Images/check.png] During Passover, the experience around the dinnertable is called the seder because rituals and discussions are conducted in acertain order.bullet [Images/check.png] The siddur offers the order of prayers to the one whowants to pray.At its core, the siddur contains the major and central prayers of theKabbalistic prayer service. But so many additional readings, meditations, andpoems have been added to the prayer book over the centuries that it’s almostimpossible during one prayer session to say everything provided with properintention.THE ORDERING OF PRAYER: FROM FORMLESS TO FORMWhen Kabbalists look back on history, they note that, in the Torah, theirearliest ancestors didn’t pray in a fixed format. Prayer was either spontaneousor varied from person to person. It wasn’t until after the Torah was received atMount Sinai that a tradition of a fixed format, or at least a fixed core ofprayers, was established.According to Jewish tradition, Moses received two Torahs from God at MountSinai: One was the written Torah, and the other was the Oral Tradition, whichwas forbidden to be written down but rather had to be carefully transmitted fromone generation to the next. These wise and saintly people developed and taught amore formal system of prayer. Many generations later, this Oral Tradition waswritten down.The keepers of the Oral Tradition were a gathering of holy individuals betweenthe fifth and third centuries BCE known by the collective term Knesset HaGadol(ken-es-et hah-gah-dole; the Men of the Great Assembly).The Oral Tradition was never supposed to be recorded formally in writing.However, the first Holy Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, and in the year 90CE, the rebuilt Temple was destroyed by the Romans. The great sages, includingKabbalists such as Rabbi Akiva, proceeded to gather the great teachings frompast generations and record them because the hostile environment in which theJewish people lived made it increasingly possible that these traditions would belost if they weren’t recorded.A great compromise was undertaken whereby the tradition was recorded in a bookthat came to be known as the Mishnah (mish-nah). The Mishnah was supplemented byother great teachings and commentary on the fundamentals of the Oral Traditionand became known as the Gemarah (ge-mah-rah). The Mishnah and the Gemarahtogether form the Talmud (tahl-mood); within the pages of the 63 volumes of theTalmud, Kabbalists find the basis for the prayer book that they use today.One of the things developed by the Knesset HaGadol and then ultimately recordedin the Talmud is the accepted order of prayers. From Talmudic times until today,the set order of prayers as detailed in the Talmud has been the basis of prayerfor generations of Kabbalists.Those who pray using the Kabbalistic prayer book tend to find that, in additionto the most essential prayers, the siddur provides many different readings andprayers for any and every occasion. Throughout the centuries, the siddur hasbeen the first book that children and families devoted to Kabbalistic traditionever encounter. At the earliest age, parents devoted to Kabbalistic traditionmake sure that their children know how to use a prayer book, how to identify itscontents, and how to establish it as a companion throughout one’s life.Generally speaking, a Kabbalist uses the same prayer book in every prayersession until it’s well-worn. People who pray regularly come to be very intimatewith their prayer books and are able to locate familiar words quickly whenneeded.Most Kabbalists today use a siddur known as the nusach Sfard (new -sakhseh-fard; the Sephardic [Spanish] rite). The contents of this prayer book arequite similar to the order of prayers as recited by the greatest Kabbalist whoever lived, Rabbi Isaac Luria (the Ari). The nusach Sfard is essentially atraditional Jewish prayer book with the additions, changes, and improvementsmade by Rabbi Luria.Superficially, one may notice that some of the prayers in the nusach Sfard arein a slightly different order than in other prayer books, but a more importantdifference is the meditations directly relating to Kabbalistic tradition thatappear in the nusach Sfard. For example, the most popular prayer book amongKabbalists today is one that opens with the following introductory prayer:Elijah opened his discourse and said: Master of the worlds, You are One but notin the numerical sense. You are exalted above all the exalted ones, hidden fromall the hidden ones; no thought can grasp You at all. You are He who broughtforth ten “garments,” and we call them ten sefirot, through which to directhidden worlds which are not revealed and revealed worlds: and through them Youconceal Yourself from man. You are He who binds them together and unites them;and in as much as You are within them, whoever separates one from another ofthese ten sefirot, it is considered as if he had effected a separation in You.These ten sefirot proceed according to their order: one long, one short, and oneintermediate. You are He who directs them, but there is no one who directs You —neither above, nor below, nor from any side. You have made garments for them,from which souls issue forth to man. You have made for them a number of bodieswhich are called “bodies,” in comparison with the garments which cover them; andthey are described [anthropomorphically] in the following manner: chesed(kindness) — the right arm; gevurah (severity, power) — the left arm;tiferet(beauty) — the torso; netzach (eternity, victory) and hod (splendor) —the two thighs; yesod (foundation) — the end of the torso, the sign of the HolyCovenant; malchut (kingship) — the mouth, which we call the Oral Torah; chochmah(wisdom) — the brain, that is, the thought within; binah (understanding) — theheart, by means of which the heart understands; and concerning the latter two[sefirot] it is written, “The secrets belong to the Lord our God”; supernalketer (crown) is the crown of kingship, concerning which it is said, “Hedeclares the end from the beginning . . .”Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]If you’re looking for a Kabbalistic prayer book, you can find one at just aboutevery Jewish bookstore and Judaica supply Web site. You can choose from prayerbooks both in Hebrew and in English that reflect the Kabbalistic customs asrecorded in the nusach Sfard siddur.A KABBALIST’S DAILY PRAYER ROUTINEThe first words on a Kabbalist’s lips each morning are a prayer, the Modeh ani(moe -deh ah -nee). It’s a simple, one-sentence prayer that’s an expression ofgratitude to God for providing a new day. Flip to Chapter 9 for the prayer andits Hebrew pronunciation.The Modeh ani is just the start of the Kabbalist’s daily prayer routine, whichconsists of three prayer sessions and the recitation of various blessings asappropriate throughout the day. In this section, I explain the three dailyprayer sessions and break down the activities that Kabbalists do during thesesessions, and I also explain the additional blessings that Kabbalists reciteover the course of a day and tell you when they’re appropriate.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]A Kabbalist’s day begins at sundown and goes through the night and into the nextday, as opposed to the day starting each morning.CONDUCTING THREE PRAYER SESSIONS A DAYKabbalists pray at least three times a day. Because one can recite prayers atany moment and in just about any place, technically it’s possible to pray allday long, almost without stopping. But the three prayer sessions establishedmany centuries ago constitute the basic structure and rhythm of the daily prayerlife of a Kabbalist. These three prayer sessions arebullet [Images/check.png] The morning service Schararit (shah-kah-reet)bullet [Images/check.png] The afternoon service Mincha (min-khah)bullet [Images/check.png] The evening service Ma’ariv (mah-ah-reeve)Kabbalistic tradition maintains that the patriarch Abraham introduced themorning prayers, Isaac introduced the afternoon prayers, and Jacob introducedthe evening prayers.Each of the three prayer sessions contains the same core, which is basically therecitation of a prayer called “The Prayer,” which contains 19 blessings, andeach session consists of 25 blessings total. I cover these elements as well asthe other activities that make up each prayer session in this section.SAYING 100 BLESSINGS EACH DAY (YES, YOU READ THAT RIGHT)The great sages taught that Kabbalists should recite 100 blessings a day.Essentially, blessings are expressions of gratitude.The word “blessing” in Hebrew is brachah (brah-khah ), its plural is brachot(brah-khowt ), and the Talmud has an entire section called Brachot that deals,among other things, with the standard formula used in every blessing.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Every blessing recited by a Kabbalist begins with the same six words: Baruchatah Adonai Elohaynu melech ha-olam (bah-rukh ah-tah ah-doe-noy eh-low-hay -numeh -lekh hah-oh-lahm; Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe).Reciting 100 blessings a day isn’t a difficult task for the traditionalKabbalist. Each of the three traditional prayer sessions contains over 25blessings, which immediately brings the number to 75. The traditional BircatHaMazon (beer-cot hah-mah-zone; grace after meals) consists of four blessings,so reciting it three times daily adds another 12 blessings, bringing the totalto 87. (See Chapter 9 for more on the grace after meals.) The morning servicecontains an additional dozen or so blessings, which brings the total number ofdaily blessings to 100 or more. In addition, as I explain in the section “Sayinga blessing for (practically) everything” later in this chapter, there are randomopportunities for the Kabbalist to recite more blessings throughout the day.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The great sages’ recommendation that at least 100 blessings be said each dayreally is intended to get Kabbalists to sprinkle their entire days with momentsof gratitude and consciousness of God. Connecting with the Almighty, beingconscious of the gifts God gives, and being constantly aware that the source ofall things is God are the primary goals of all Kabbalists at all times.Kabbalists want to make sure that they express this awareness that promptsgratitude and don’t take it for granted.THE DAILY MORNING BLESSINGSThe liturgy that Kabbalists follow includes a series of blessings that are saidonly in the morning. The blessings cover a wide range of aspects of life. As youcan see, some of the blessings are more complex than others (I provide the exactblessings in Chapter 9):bullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for the Torah. Kabbalists recite a fewblessings early every day to express gratitude to God for commanding them toinvolve themselves with the words of Torah, for teaching them the wisdom of theTorah, and, in general, for giving the Torah.bullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for an understanding heart. Kabbalistsbelieve that God gives people three aspects of consciousness: Chochmah (wisdom),Binah (understanding), and Da’at (knowledge). (Refer to Chapter 4 for fullcoverage of these forces.) Wisdom, which is intuitive, and understanding, whichis analytic, combine in a blessing called sechel (say-kill), which refers toboth common sense and a profound grasp. Sechel implies that deep understandingis found in the heart. Specifically, the blessing thanking God for giving theKabbalist an understanding heart also refers to the divine gift that allowshuman beings to distinguish between and among things.The blessing expresses gratitude for giving Kabbalists the ability todistinguish between day and night, which, as every Kabbalist knows, also implieslight and darkness, and good and evil. So one of the first blessings recitedeach day by Kabbalists reminds them to examine life closely in order to increasethe light and decrease the darkness.bullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for a relationship with God. Everymorning, Kabbalists recite a prayer expressing thanks for not being among thosewho don’t have a covenantal relationship with God based on the 613 commandmentsof the Torah. Every morning Kabbalists express thanks for being born into orhaving discovered a tradition that acknowledges and enhances one’s relationshipto God.bullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God that you aren’t a slave. This blessinghelps the Kabbalist wake up in the morning and configure his or her day in aproper way. Serving the right goals with one’s activities each day is veryimportant.In this traditional blessing, the Kabbalist thanks God for not making theKabbalist an aved (ah-ved; servant or slave). A slave, in the sense meant in theblessing, is someone who answers to an earthly master. This blessing containswhat seems like a contradiction: On the one hand, the Kabbalist feels the greaturge to acknowledge that he isn’t a slave to anyone or to anything. On the otherhand, a Kabbalist like the patriarch Abraham desires nothing more than to be a“servant of God.”bullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for giving sight to the blindbullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for clothing the nakedbullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for releasing those who are boundbullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for straightening what is bentbullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for spreading out the earth upon thewatersbullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for making a man’s foot steps firmbullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for providing for everyone’s every needbullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for giving the Children of Israelstrengthbullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for crowning the Children of Israel withsplendorbullet [Images/check.png] Thanking God for giving strength to the wearyREFLECTING ON THE BINDING OF ISAACIn the prayer book used by Kabbalists, the morning service includes the entiretext of a story found in the Bible’s book of Genesis. That story, known as theAkedah (ah-kay -dah; the Binding of Isaac), is essentially the story of Abrahamtaking his son Isaac up a mountain, as commanded by God, in order to offer himas a sacrifice. (Of course, if you were to read Genesis 22:1–19, you’d find thatthe literal sacrifice never took place and that, at the last moment, an animalwas exchanged for Isaac.)This chronicle of the most challenging test that God gave to Abraham is filledwith symbolism and spiritual challenges of all kinds. Kabbalistic tradition,including the text of the Zohar as well as the teachings of Rabbi Isaac Luria,have established that reading and reflecting on the story on a daily basis is ofprofound importance. Rabbi Isaac Luria even went so far as to say that recitingthe Akedah each day brings complete atonement to someone who expresses sincereregret for his or her errors.SINGING SONGS OF PRAISEAs part of the morning prayer session, Kabbalists spend time singing songs ofpraise to God. The traditional Kabbalistic prayer book contains many songs ofpraise, each of which follows the theme of heartfelt expression of praise forthe Master of the universe, for its creation, and for the bounty that’s offeredto the world daily.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalists believe that the universe is created anew each moment and that Godconsciously wills the universe into existence at all times (see Chapter 4). Withthese foundational beliefs, it’s easy for the Kabbalist to be eager to singsongs praising God.PROCLAIMING THE LORD IS ONEDuring both the morning and the evening prayer sessions, Kabbalists recitewhat’s considered the central prayer of all Jewish tradition, the Sh’ma(sheh-mah ). The Sh’ma is a public proclamation of God’s oneness. Kabbalistsrecite the first line of the Sh’ma, Sh’ma Yisrael, Adonai Ehlohaynu, AdonaiEhchad (sheh-mah yis-rah-ehl ah-doh-noy eh-loh-hay -noo ah-doh-noy eh -chahd;Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One), with particular intensityevery morning and every evening.SAYING “THE PRAYER”All three of the Kabbalist’s daily prayer sessions — the morning, afternoon, andevening sessions — contain a core prayer firmly established by the great sagesdozens of centuries ago. In the Talmud, the great sages simply refer to thisprayer as Tefillah (teh-fee -lah), which means “The Prayer,” due to itsparamount importance.Kabbalists also know “The Prayer” by two other names. One name is the Amidah(ah-mee -dah; standing), which comes from the fact that Kabbalists say Tefillahin a standing position. The inner intention while standing is to imagine thatone is in the inner chambers of the palace of the King and has a privateaudience with the King himself. One stands before God in earnestness whilereciting what are essentially 18 blessings (one more was added several centuriesago). The other name for “The Prayer” is Shmoneh Esrai (sheh-moe -nah es -ray;18 blessings).The following is a list of blessings that make up the current format of theTefillah, the central prayer within every traditional Kabbalistic prayerservice. Essentially, this prayer is a series of blessings givingbullet [Images/check.png] Gratitude to God for his kindness and for everythingthat He creates, while recalling the great patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,who are either genealogical or spiritual ancestors of all Kabbalistsbullet [Images/check.png] Acknowledgment of God’s mightbullet [Images/check.png] Acknowledgment of God’s holinessbullet [Images/check.png] Gratitude for the wisdom, insight, and knowledge thatGod has given the Kabbalistbullet [Images/check.png] Gratitude for the gift of teshuva (see Chapter 8),which is the opportunity and capacity to change and to perfect oneselfbullet [Images/check.png] Gratitude to God for the forgiveness He offersbullet [Images/check.png] Gratitude to God for His promise of completeredemptionbullet [Images/check.png] A heartfelt request to God to cure and heal Kabbalistsof their afflictions and illnessesbullet [Images/check.png] A heartfelt request for prosperitybullet [Images/check.png] Gratitude to God for His promise to gather theshattered Jewish family together once morebullet [Images/check.png] Gratitude to God for the principle of Justicebullet [Images/check.png] A heartfelt request for protection from slanderersbullet [Images/check.png] Gratitude to God for providing Kabbalists withrighteous people among thembullet [Images/check.png] A heartfelt request to God to rebuild the holy city ofJerusalem and the Holy Templebullet [Images/check.png] Gratitude to God for the future redemption and theassistance that King David and his descendents will give in the future for thisredemptionbullet [Images/check.png] A heartfelt request that God accept Kabbalists’prayersbullet [Images/check.png] Gratitude to God for receiving Kabbalists’ prayersbullet [Images/check.png] A heartfelt blessing of thanksgivingbullet [Images/check.png] A heartfelt request for peace, goodness, and blessingin Kabbalists’ livesSAYING A BLESSING FOR (PRACTICALLY) EVERYTHINGIn addition to the fixed order of blessings contained in the morning service,the traditional Kabbalistic siddur provides many blessings for all kinds ofoccasions.The great Kabbalists teach the importance of expressing gratitude to God foreverything. The wide variety of blessings provided in the Talmud and recorded inthe prayer book serve the Kabbalist well in many different circumstances.According to Kabbalistic tradition, one can never express too much thanks to theCreator.The prayer book that Kabbalists use contains blessings to be recited whenKabbalistsbullet [Images/check.png] See lightningbullet [Images/check.png] Hear thunderbullet [Images/check.png] See a rainbowbullet [Images/check.png] Experience an earthquakebullet [Images/check.png] See a cometbullet [Images/check.png] See extraordinarily large mountainsbullet [Images/check.png] See exceptionally large riversbullet [Images/check.png] See the oceanbullet [Images/check.png] See beautiful peoplebullet [Images/check.png] See beautiful treesbullet [Images/check.png] See beautiful fieldsbullet [Images/check.png] See exceptionally strange-looking peoplebullet [Images/check.png] See exceptionally strange-looking animalsbullet [Images/check.png] See the first fruits of the seasonbullet [Images/check.png] Encounter an outstanding scholar of Torah wisdombullet [Images/check.png] Encounter an outstanding scholar of secular wisdombullet [Images/check.png] See over 600,000 people in one placebullet [Images/check.png] See a friend who has recovered from a life-threateningillnessbullet [Images/check.png] See a synagogue that has been destroyedbullet [Images/check.png] See a synagogue that was destroyed but has beenrestoredbullet [Images/check.png] Visit a place where a known miracle has occurredbullet [Images/check.png] Hear good newsbullet [Images/check.png] Hear bad newsbullet [Images/check.png] Put on new clothing for the first timeIn addition to the blessings that cover the circumstances listed, Kabbalists cansay a general blessing at any time. They often use this blessing to expresstheir gratitude and deepest feelings of appreciation to the Almighty. Theblessing is as follows:Baruch atah Adonai Elohaynu melech Ha-olam, she’he’che’yanu v’kee’manu,v’hee’gee’anu la’zman ha’zeh.bah-rukh ah-tah ah-doe-noy eh-low-hay-nu meh-lekh hah-oh-lahmsheh-heh-khee-yah-noo vah-key-ee-mahn-noo veh-hig-ee-yah-noo laz-mahn hah-zehBlessed are you Lord, our God King of the universe, Who keeps us alive, sustainsus, and has permitted us to reach this moment.DEVOTIONAL POETRY THROUGH THE AGESA new era of Jewish history began at the end of the Talmudic period,particularly in the area of prayer. What unfolded was the beginning of a longtradition of writing beautiful songs and poems fit for inclusion in the liturgy.The devotional poetry written by the great liturgical poets produced piyutim(pee-you-teem; devotional prayers). (The singular form is piyut [pee-yoot].)Piyutim refers to the whole body of religious poetry written throughout the agesto aid in public prayer. Piyutim have been added to the standard Kabbalisticprayer sessions and serve as interludes between the core text established by themen of the Great Assembly so many centuries ago and followed diligently byKabbalists throughout the ages.Although not part of the essential text, piyutim often become a Kabbalist’sfavorite part of prayer, and Kabbalists find that they’re drawn to one piyut oranother with great intensity. A single piyut may have a deep personal meaningthat the Kabbalist can connect to and participate in wholeheartedly with thecommunity in public prayer.Piyutim continue to be written today, and from time to time, communities adoptnew prayers as part of their standard prayer services. If I had a say, I’d addtwo modern liturgical songs to the standard prayer book: Leonard Cohen’s“Halleluyah” and “If It Be Your Will.” Check ’em out, and I think you’ll agree."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16KNOWING THE UNKNOWABLE GODIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Accepting the inconceivable nature of Godbullet [Images/arrow.png] Exploring how Kabbalists know and relate to Godbullet [Images/arrow.png] Working through God’s many namesBeing a Kabbalist sure has its challenges. And one of the biggest ones has to dowith God. For Kabbalists, God is the center of everything, the goal ofeverything, and the source of everything. All study and actions are ultimatelyabout God. In a way, God is all that there is for a Kabbalist. And yet, there’sno comprehensive way to understand, know, or conceive of God, nor can one fullydescribe, imagine, or encounter God.In this chapter, I fill you in on why it’s impossible to fully understand Godbut why Kabbalists don’t let that stop them from trying. I also explain howKabbalists know God and the various names they use to refer to God.UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU CAN’T UNDERSTAND IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD UNDERSTANDINGKabbalists learn about God through the many verses in the Holy Scriptures thatspeak about God. Following is a list of some of the things Kabbalists learnabout God through a careful study of the texts:bullet [Images/check.png] God is omnipotent; God’s power is unlimited. “All thatGod wishes, he does, in heaven and earth, in the seas and all the deeps” (Psalms135:6).bullet [Images/check.png] God is incorporeal; God has no physical form. “Takegood heed of yourselves, for you saw no manner of form on that day that Godspoke to you at Horeb.” (Deuteronomy 4:15).bullet [Images/check.png] God is unique and unlike anything. “To whom will youthen liken God? To what likeness will you compare Him?” (Isaiah 40:18); “Thereis none like You, O God” (Jeremiah 10:6); “There are none like You among thepowers (angels), O God, and there are no words like Yours” (Psalms 86:8).bullet [Images/check.png] God is absolutely unchangeable and unchanging. “I amGod, I do not change” (Malachi 3:6).bullet [Images/check.png] God is immanent, filling all creation. “Holy, holy,holy is God of Hosts, the whole world is filed with His Glory” (Isaiah 6:3).bullet [Images/check.png] God is omnipresent; God is everywhere. “All the earthis filled with God’s Glory” (Numbers 14:21).bullet [Images/check.png] God is omniscient; God knows everything. “Can a manhide himself in secret places so that I will not see him? Do I then not fillheaven and earth?” (Jeremiah 23:24); “God’s eyes are in every place, beholdingthe evil and the good” (Proverbs 15:3).bullet [Images/check.png] God knows man’s thoughts. “God probes every heart andperceives every urge of thought” (1 Chronicles 28:9); “[God] knows the secretsof the heart” (Psalms 44:21).bullet [Images/check.png] God exists outside of time; God knows the future asGod knows the past. “I call the generations from the beginning; I, God, am theFirst, and with the last I am the same” (Isaiah 41:4).bullet [Images/check.png] God’s knowledge is identical with God’s infiniteEssence. “[God’s] understanding is infinite” (Psalms 147:5).bullet [Images/check.png] God is impossible to comprehend. “Can you by searchingfind out God? Can you probe the Almighty to perfection?” (Job 11:7); “Mythoughts are not your thoughts, nor are My ways your ways” (Isaiah 48:17).FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]The study of Kabbalah is full of paradoxes. A long time ago, one of my teacherstaught me the difference between a paradox and an absurdity: A paradox is astatement that’s seemingly contradictory or opposed to common sense but perhapsis true, whereas an absurdity is ridiculously unreasonable, unsound, orincongruous. More important, my teacher taught me that a paradox is usually asign that one is going in the right direction. When discussing the subject ofGod, this lesson rings very true.Simply put, it’s impossible to conceive of God. So a paradox is at work in thequestion, “How can a person even begin to discuss a subject that’s categoricallybeyond his understanding?” The answer is that, in some mysterious way, theacknowledgement that something is beyond understanding is indeed a giant step inthe direction of understanding the very thing that can’t be grasped.Kabbalists believe that the greatest leader who ever lived was Moses and that,of all Moses’s personality traits and characteristics, the most fundamental washis humility. Kabbalists take a similarly humble stance when approaching God.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The attitude to cultivate is not that God is possible to grasp but rather thatGod is impossible to grasp. In this vast, infinite universe, Kabbalists see eachperson as a mere speck, a tiny little detail in an inconceivably giganticuniverse. How could anyone even begin to dare to think that he or she couldgrasp the world, let alone its creator? It simply can’t be done, and those whoclaim that they can do it are either fooling everyone else or foolingthemselves.GOD IS BEYOND ALL POSSIBLE UNDERSTANDINGOne of the mistakes that people often make when pursuing a spiritual path isfoolishly thinking that they can master a curriculum. Even though there’s muchto learn, one can never understand or master the ultimate subject, God. In fact,one of my teachers pointed out that any God that can be understood isn’t a Godworth having.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]Over the years, one of my Kabbalah teachers has stressed the absolutelyunbridgeable gap between each of us and God. As he put it, you would never finda Kabbalist preaching about what God is on a Sunday morning television show. Ifanything, a Kabbalist would preach that all he or she knows is what God is not.If God is at the center of everything, and if God is the focal point ofeverything that the Kabbalist does, how is it possible to proceed if all one cansay about God is either nothing or what God is not? Here again the paradoxreveals itself: Kabbalists are able to make spiritual progress by continuouslyunderstanding that they can’t understand.Kabbalists do understand that humans can and do get glimpses of God in anynumber of ways. One way is through the hints and statements found in the HolyScriptures. However, generally the sages teach that what people know about Godis known mainly through the way God manifests in the world. They clarify thatalthough people see how God manifests, they can’t know God. Some Kabbalistsbelieve that the way to know God is through the ten sefirot, which I cover inChapter 4.Kabbalists recite a well-known passage about God from the classic Kabbalah text,the Zohar (see Chapter 13), as a meditation every morning before the morningprayers. The passage, which follows, is found in the standard Kabbalah prayerbook. It addresses the unknowable nature of God.You are One, but not in counting. You are exalted beyond all exalted, morehidden than all hidden. No thought grasps You at all. You brought forth the tensefirot with which to guide concealed and revealed worlds; in them You concealedYourself from human beings . . . You guide them but no one guides you . . . Youare the Reason of reasons and the Cause of causes . . . In you there is no imageor likeness of anything, inside or out . . . No one knows You at all. And besideYou there is no Oneness . . . You are known as the cause of all and the masterof all . . . Each sefirah has a name . . . but You have no known name for Youfill all names and You are the wholeness of all . . . You are wise but not witha known wisdom. You are understanding but not with an known understanding. Youhave no known place . . . But in order to make your power and might known tohuman beings and to show them how the world is guided with judgment andcompassion there exists justice and lawfulness in accordance with the deeds ofhuman beings . . . to demonstrate how the world functions, but not that You havea known trait of exacting justice nor a known lawfulness, which is associatedwith compassion, nor any of these measures whatsoever.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my Kabbalah teachers looks to a theorem in geometry as a way to approachthe issue of knowing an unknowable God. The Desargues’ Theorem in projectivegeometry is rather easy to grasp when one looks at the detail of it, but aproblem arises in that there seems to be no way to prove this theorem . . .unless one introduces a point located in the infinite (which, of course, isimpossible to grasp).My teacher explains that so it is with life and the Kabbalist’s relationship toGod: Without God, the world seems to make little (if any) sense, yet when theInfinite factors into the vision of the world, a transformation occurs. Soalthough it’s true that God is beyond all possible understanding, the Kabbalistintroduces the totally incomprehensible God into the formula of life and,miraculously, things begin to make some sense.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Despite the fact that understanding God is impossible, Kabbalists never give uptrying. In Kabbalistic terms, the mysteries of life and efforts to understandthem are an exercise in the sefirah of Binah (understanding; see Chapter 4). Infact, the Kabbalistic way of meditation is to meditate on the unknowable God,trying to use the mind as much as possible to go beyond limited concepts andlimited perspectives and essentially try to leap over the boundaries of themind. And although Kabbalists know that God can never be grasped, the effort isnonetheless profoundly worthwhile.GOD IS BEYOND TIMEThe concept of God being beyond time is a difficult, perhaps impossible, one tograsp. Nevertheless, as I explain in the preceding section, the Kabbalistdoesn’t throw her hands up in helplessness. She recognizes the impossibility ofthe task and tries anyway, knowing that an effort to grasp the ungraspable isprecisely the task of the Kabbalist.One of the notions about God and time that appears often in Kabbalisticliterature is that God was, is, and will be, and that God knows what was, whatis, and what will be. The Kabbalist needs to push her mind out of the usualrealm of thought in order to grasp what it means for God to be outside of time.The opening words of the Torah are, “Bereyshis boro Elohim es ha-shamayim v’esha-ah-retz” (ber-ay -shees ba-ra el-loh-heem es hah-shah-mah -yim ves hah-ahr-etz). The popular translation of this first Hebrew line of the Five Books ofMoses is “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” Kabbalistslook at this statement differently, breaking down the Hebrew into the following:The first word, Bereyshit, means “In the beginning.”The second word, boro, means “created.”The third word, Elohim, is one of God’s names.The translation of these three words is, “In the beginning created God” or “Godcreated in the beginning.” How does this differ from the popular translation?For Kabbalists, God existed before the beginning, and therefore God created thebeginning. God created time.IF GOD SEES THE FUTURE, DO PEOPLE HAVE FREE WILL?The notion that God is beyond time and that God knows what was, what is, andwhat will be certainly challenges usual sensibilities. If God knows what willbe, the logical question is “Are people able to choose freely?” After all, ifGod knows what will happen, doesn’t that imply that everything is preordained?The great sage and mystic Rabbi Akiva expresses this paradox concisely when hewrites, “All is foreseen and free will is given.” Rabbi Akiva approaches thisparadox head-on by reminding Kabbalists that although God sees what will be, thehuman experience is one of free will and free choice.Remember that humans are made in God’s image; just as God can create and hasfree will, so does the human being have freedom of choice. Keeping that point inmind, Kabbalists are able to reconcile the ideas that God is outside of time,God can see the future, and people have freedom to choose. The effort to graspwhat is impossible to grasp has positive results for the spiritual seeker.GOD IS BEYOND MATTERAll Kabbalists know that one of the names of God is HaMakom (hah-mah-cohm; theplace). They conceive God as “the place of the world” and often say thateverything is God, and even that there is nothing else but God. But God isn’tmaterial, and any inclination to conceive of God as physical or material is aprofound transgression. Since time immemorial, Kabbalists have made every effortto avoid picturing God in any physical terms whatsoever. A distinction can bemade between two ways of thinking about God: pantheism and panentheism. Whereaspantheism equates God with the world, panentheism means that God is in all theworlds. A Kabbalist would say that everything resides in God.A legend involving the patriarch Abraham reflects the Kabbalistic notion thatGod is beyond matter. The legends says that Abraham was the son of an idolworshipper and was given the task of watching over his father’s idols. One ofthe idols broke, and when Abraham’s father returned, Abraham explained that theidol was smashed by another idol. This clever explanation was Abraham’s attemptto show his father that belief in physical objects was foolishness.Because the Holy Scriptures state that man was made in God’s image, Kabbalistsgo so far as to prohibit the sculpting of the human form as a three-dimensionalobject in an effort to prevent any possible conception of God. God isn’t thesun, the moon, mountains, the universe, or anything else that can be conceivedof in finite terms. The Kabbalist is urged to push his mind beyond anythingordinarily conceivable.GOD IS BEYOND THE SPIRITOne of the most serious errors made by individuals who adopt a spiritual path isto conceive of God as “Spirit,” or to say that God is spiritual, not physical.Kabbalists are emphatic about this point and say that God is not only beyondmatter but also beyond spirit; God is beyond anything that can be conceived ofin any terms whatsoever.The emotion of love, for example, is a spiritual notion. One can’t hold love,take a photograph of love, or contain love in any physical sense. Ideas are alsospiritual when they’re expressed in the abstract. Just as God isn’t an emotion,God isn’t an idea.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Often people make the mistake of thinking that God is spiritual. Kabbalists mustalways remind themselves that there’s no effective way to define God and breakfree of any limitations that they have concerning a definition of God. Manythings in the world are spiritual, including feelings, thoughts, and angels (seeChapter 8), but God isn’t spiritual.GOD IS BEYOND INFINITYIn Kabbalah, thinking of God as infinite is a limitation. As I explainthroughout this chapter, God is beyond everything that the human mind canpossibly grasp. People have a tendency to make things concrete; an example isthe designation of God as G-O-D, a three-letter word. No word, whether threeletters or a million letters, can even begin to name or describe God.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]One of my Kabbalah teachers points out that the word infinity still refers tosomething finite. For example, even though a set of numbers is infinite, thenumbers themselves are finite. When Kabbalists talk about God, however, thenotion of infinity expands to the infinite degree. (Am I blowing your mind yet?)God is infinite but in no way similar to an infinite set of numbers — God isinfinite beyond any terms.One of the implications of the Kabbalistic notion of God as infinite beyond allinfinity is that nothing in the world is farther away from God or nearer to God.Similarly, from the vantage point of the infinite, everything is of the sameproportion; the largest disaster as measured against the infinite is no largerthan the brief movement of someone’s little finger.CALLING GOD THE PARADOXICAL NAME “OUR FATHER, OUR KING”One of the phrases that Kabbalists use in prayer is Aveenu Malkaynu (ah-vee-newmal-kay-new; Our Father, Our King). This name of God reminds Kabbalists of theparadox of existence. God is both father and king. A father is very intimate;one can sit on his lap and touch his cheek. In contrast, a king is distant; onerarely even catches a glimpse of a king, and if so, simply for a short period oftime. By conceiving of God as Aveenu Malkaynu, Kabbalists use their limitedlanguage to indicate that paradoxical nature of God.SO WHAT’S THE POINT?If God is infinite beyond anything that people can conceive of; if God is beyondtime, matter, and spirit; if God is unable to be described by any meanswhatsoever, then why enter into what seems to be a frustrating process (tryingto understand God) with no apparent solution?Rest assured that many a beginning Kabbalah student has thrown his or her handsup in exasperation at the intense emphasis on God being beyond everything.However, by deliberately pushing the mind in the direction of conceiving of Godas inconceivable, Kabbalists ultimately come to a clearer understanding ofreality. The Kabbalist wants to be absolutely honest in her explorations, and analmost constant (if not actually constant) effort to break free of limitationsand to keep pushing her conception of God in the direction of the ultimateinfinite nature of God is necessary to do so.A conception of God beyond all infinite has other implications, too. Forexample, as I discuss in Chapter 9, a conception of God as infinite changesone’s view on the question of whether God is aware of the smallest details ofhuman lives. By seeing God as infinite, the Kabbalist is aware that nothinghappens without God knowing about it and that, in fact, nothing happens withoutGod allowing it to happen.The conception of God as infinite makes everything significant. If God isinfinite (meaning that nothing is bigger or smaller before God), then eachperson’s next thought, inclination, or act has far more significance in thecosmos than it would if God were conceived of as anything less than infinite.WHAT KABBALISTS KNOW ABOUT GOD, EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT GODKabbalah is the theology of the Jewish people, so although Kabbalistic notionsabout God aren’t different from Jewish notions about God, the difference betweenKabbalists and other Jews often is simply that Kabbalists could be said to bealmost obsessed with God. Kabbalists think about God, meditate about God,struggle with ideas about God, and try to stay conscious of God constantly.Kabbalists know that God is here, right now, and not in the heavens. God is ineverything we do. As one of my teachers said, “It’s not that I know somethingyou don’t know; it’s just that I’m busy knowing it and you’re not busy knowingit.”Kabbalists are emphatic on the point that God is beyond anything that humans canconceive of, and yet, Kabbalistic tradition speaks about God in many ways. Thefollowing is what Kabbalists know and believe about God:bullet [Images/check.png] God exists. As obvious as this may sound, belief inGod’s existence is considered to be a mitzvah, a Divine commandment. In fact,God’s existence is the very first teaching in the great Jewish philosopherMaimonides’s code of law, the Mishnah Torah (mish-neh toe-rah). Almost asbackground music to one’s entire life, belief in the existence of God isfundamental and all-pervasive in the life of the Kabbalist.bullet [Images/check.png] God is one. The oneness of God is embedded into thevery root structure of Kabbalistic belief. The implication of God as one is thatno other gods or beings have participated in the creation of the world. Also,God is considered to be a unity, which means that God is a single whole andcomplete entity; God can’t be divided into parts. The most popular prayer inJewish life is known as the Sh’ma (sheh-mah). The first statement of the Sh’mais “Hear O Israel the Lord our God the Lord is one.” Kabbalists recite thisstatement twice a day.bullet [Images/check.png] God is incorporeal (that is, God doesn’t have a body).A fundamental belief of Kabbalists is that God doesn’t have a body; anyreference to God’s body is simply a metaphor to help make one’s understanding ofGod’s ways more comprehensible. Representing God physically is forbidden.bullet [Images/check.png] God is omnipresent. Kabbalists believe that God iseverywhere and is always near. One distinction that’s sometimes made between theview of Kabbalah and the view of pantheism is that, whereas pantheism is markedby the notion that everything is God, Kabbalah has the point of view thateverything resides in God. According to Kabbalah, in some way, the world isseparate from God even though everything comes from God and God fills theuniverse. This paradox appears countless times in Kabbalistic literature.bullet [Images/check.png] God is omnipotent. The belief that God can doeverything and has unlimited power is fundamental among Kabbalists. This beliefin God’s omnipotence has been tested often throughout Jewish history,particularly when bad things have happened to the Jewish people, prompting thequestion, “Why?” Unlike some individuals who look at the suffering of the worldand conclude that God isn’t all-powerful, Kabbalistic tradition insists thathumans simply can’t understand everything; God can do everything, and it’sthrough faith and trust in God that people overcome the obstacle of thesuffering around them.bullet [Images/check.png] God is omniscient. Kabbalists believe that God knowseverything, including what people think. God knows everything that was,everything that is, and everything that will be.bullet [Images/check.png] God is eternal. Kabbalists believe that God is beyondall designations of time: God had no beginning, and God will have no end. Infact, when Moses asked God for His name, the answer that came was Ehyeh AsherEhyeh (eh-yeh ah-sher eh-yeh; I Am that I Am). The word “ehyeh” can also betranslated in the future tense to mean, “I am what I will be,” “I will be what Iwill be,” or “I am becoming what I am becoming.”bullet [Images/check.png] God is perfect. The Kabbalistic view of God includesthe notions that God has no needs, God is totally whole, and God lacks nothing.bullet [Images/check.png] God is neither male nor female. Despite the fact thatthe Torah uses the male pronoun for God, the Kabbalistic conception of God isthat God is genderless. Many languages have masculine and feminine forms builtinto the language, but in no way does that mean that the thing being named has agender. Similarly, although ancient texts often refer to God in the masculine,in no way do they contradict the basic Kabbalistic notion that God has nophysical form and no body and therefore is neither male nor female.DEVELOPING A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH AN UNFATHOMABLE GOD (YES, IT CAN BEDONE)On my bulletin board, I’ve posted this quote from a book of physics: “In physicsyou don’t understand a new idea, you just get used to it.” The same goes forone’s faith in God: A finite human being can never grasp the infinite andcertainly can’t grasp the infinite beyond all infinities. But as experiencedKabbalists have reported throughout the centuries, progress is made as one praysand meditates on God. In other words, Kabbalists get used to the idea of Godbeing unfathomable.Beyond that, as impossible as it seems, Kabbalists do indeed establish personalrelationships with an inconceivable God. God has no face and no form, and noimage could possibly be attached to one’s conception of God. And yet, bymeditating and praying on one’s awareness of the presence of God at all timesand all places, God becomes tangible. The dedicated Kabbalist arrives at thepoint where God is present always and is felt to be present always. Thisawareness leads to great faith and reliance on God as the one and only reality.For the Kabbalist, all that exists is God; everything else is an illusion.WE CAN’T FIND GOD, BUT GOD ALWAYS FINDS USTo deal with the challenge of thinking about a God that can’t be conceived of,Kabbalists often look to one of the books of the Bible, the Song of Songs, assomething of a description of the human relationship with God. The Song ofSongs, which on one level is an erotic love poem, offers the senses of beinghidden and flirtation. The implication is that God is a hidden God.Among the primary teachings of Rabbi Isaac Luria, often referred to as thegreatest Kabbalist who ever lived, is the notion that God needed to reduceHimself and back off in order to make room for Creation. After all, a God that’sinfinite in all directions and in every way leaves no room for Creation. Theword for God’s contraction is tzimtzum (tzim -tzoom), and it explains why God isa hidden God. In fact, Rabbi Luria presents the notion that, by definition, Godis hidden and the task of life is to find God.If God is not only hidden but also beyond all possible understanding, time,matter, and spirit, adding God to one’s life is quite a challenge. The naturalquestions the Kabbalist asks arebullet [Images/check.png] How is it possible to bring such a God into one’s lifein any kind of meaningful way?bullet [Images/check.png] How can one pray to a God that one can’t conceive of?bullet [Images/check.png] How can one imagine a God that one can’t conceive of?bullet [Images/check.png] How can one speak of a God that one can’t conceive of?bullet [Images/check.png] What difference does it all make?In spite of these questions, countless people of faith throughout the centuries,including Kabbalists, have stated without the shadow of a doubt that God ispresent in their lives, that God is real and is the most important aspect oftheir lives. Many people who meditate on these abstract notions even claim thatthey “hear” God’s voice.Kabbalistic tradition represents that some things can’t be understood throughwords alone but rather need an experience. For example, as it’s recounted in theTorah, when God offered the Torah to the Children of Israel, they said, “Na’asehv’Nishmah” (nah-ah-seh vuh-nish-mah ; We will do and we will understand).FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]My teacher has taught me quite emphatically that there’s simply no way for aperson to make a connection with God. No amount of meditation or yearning orreaching up to the heavens can connect a person with the Almighty. Theconnection can only be made from the other side. In other words, only God canreach out to humans and bridge the gap between Him and His creation. Another ofmy teachers used this familiar analogy: A father and his little child arewalking down the street together. The child wants to hold her father’s hand andreaches up to take his hand. If the father is too tall and the child too short,no amount of effort from the child can bridge the gap. The father must reachdown to the child’s hand in order to make contact.So why does God want people to seek Him? According to my teachers, even thoughpeople can’t bridge the gap between themselves and God, God appreciates theirefforts. Keeping with the analogy of father and child, even though the childcan’t reach her father’s hand, the father still likes to see that an effort hasbeen made as opposed to the child holding her father’s hand without puttingforth any effort.BECOMING A MASTER OF RETURN (AND I’M NOT TALKING TENNIS)Twentieth and twenty-first century Kabbalists are familiar with the term baalteshuva (bal teh-shoo -vah). Baal means “master,” and teshuva, in this context,means “return.” A baal teshuva (baalat teshuva for a female), therefore,describes a person who’s trying to master the art of returning to God (morespecifically, thinking about God, connecting with God, and reaching out to God).Although the term most often describes someone who wasn’t raised in a religiousenvironment and who has decided to become “religious” (or perhaps more precisely“observant”), all Kabbalists are baaley teshuvah (the plural of baal teshuvah)because they’re all engaged in the constant process of returning to God.TALKING TO GODA way to bring the reality of God closer is simply to talk to God. One of thegreat Kabbalistic masters, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, urged his followers torecite prayers without preparation in addition to reciting the daily standardprayer sessions. He wanted them to just ad-lib it and urged people to spend aminimum of an hour alone each day talking out loud to God using their own words.Rabbi Nachman taught that the words one speaks during these prayers should bethe same words that one would use when talking to a close friend.This practice of talking to God is called hitbodedut (hit-bow-dih-doot; to makeoneself be in solitude). Rabbi Nachman suggested that the best place to do thiswas in a forest or a field, among the world of nature. The practice, accordingto Rabbi Nachman should include pouring one’s heart out to God about one’stroubles, problems, and feelings — from personal difficulties to business woesto problems of belief and faith. He even suggested that if a Kabbalist finds ithard to talk to God, she should admit to God that she doesn’t know how to do it.WHY GOD MATTERS MORE THAN YOU MAY THINKEstablishing a close relationship with God and continuing to work on thatrelationship can have a huge impact on one’s life. Kabbalists report thatovercoming the fact that God can’t be fathomed is possible only through one’ssincere efforts. Studying the great sages’ words about God and regular heartfeltprayer help the Kabbalist achieve a level of consciousness where he or she feelsGod’s presence constantly. And when this happens, everything changes. The wayone perceives the world, the way one looks at one’s own suffering, the goals onesets in life, the way one evaluates one’s life, the way one relates to others —everything changes.Tip [Images/Tip.jpg]In the early 18th century, the great Kabbalist, Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto,wrote a book about God that has become a classic. Derech HaShem (whichtranslates to The Way of God ) is readily available in English and is a greatresource for more on the Kabbalist’s personal relationship with God.SIX WAYS A KABBALIST RELATES TO GODKabbalists work on at least six different ways of relating to God. These sixways tend to overlap and are sometimes even referred to interchangeably.EMUNAH: FAITHFromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]Emunah (eh-moo -nah; faith) is a general term for the approach that Kabbalistscultivate regarding belief in a supreme being. In this world that contains somuch suffering, believing in any God is difficult, let alone a God that’s themoving force behind everything. One of my Kabbalah teachers says that anyone whoclaims that he or she never has any doubts about God is a liar. Everyone, eventhe most pious people have moments of doubt. When things are going well andeverything seems to be in order, faith is easy to cultivate, but when things aredifficult, or worse, when tragic things happen, people grapple with their faith.BITACHON: TRUSTBitachon (bit-ah-khone; trust) implies that even when Kabbalists have doubts orconfusion about painful events around them, they cultivate their trust that Godknows what He is doing and that everything that happens is for the best (in anoften hidden way). In Kabbalistic literature, the terms “emunah” and “bitachon”are often used interchangeably, even though bitachon is actually a specificaspect of faith.DEVEIKUT: CLINGINGDeveikut (dih-vay-koot; clinging) is the spiritual activity of attaching oneselfto God, to the point where one feels that one has abandoned one’s own will andaligned oneself with the will of God. Deveikut is sometimes seen as a smashingof the ego and merging into God. Kabbalistic discussions of deveikut often referto unification, implying that deveikut is an effort to connect with God on sucha profound level that one almost stops being aware of one’s separateness fromGod and grasps and experiences the oneness of all things.KAVANAH: INNER INTENTIONKavanah (kah-vah-nah; inner intention) is a way of relating to God that impliesthat anything one does is done with God in mind. Kabbalists believe that everymitzvah (divine commandment) is actually another way to relate to God. When donewith kavanah, one’s consciousness is more completely filled with attention toGod. In many synagogues, the statement Dah lifnay me attah ohmayd (dah lif-naymee ah-tah oh-maid; Know before whom you stand) appears on the wall. TheKabbalist’s goal is to always have awareness that he or she is standing beforeGod.TESHUVA: REPENTANCETeshuva (teh-shoo -vah) has many translations, including “repentance,”“turning,” and “turning to.” The word “repentance” implies a momentary activityof regretting one’s activities and reorienting oneself, but the Kabbalisticsense of teshuva is of a more constant, ongoing process of adopting a neworientation and going toward God. It ceases to be an isolated act and becomes anall-pervasive path.TEFILLAH: PRAYERTefillah (teh-fee -lah; praying) is the process of acknowledging, receiving,perceiving, and honoring that God is everywhere through prayer. Kabbalists payparticular attention to bringing the proper kavanah to prayer so that prayerisn’t just the recitation of words, without consciousness. Tefillah should be avehicle by which a person can increase his or her awareness of God’s constantpresence.CALLING GOD BY NAME (EVEN THOUGH GOD’S NAMELESS)According to Kabbalistic tradition, no finite sound or combination of letters —basically, no name — could possibly come close to doing justice to the InfiniteOne.Nevertheless, many names are used to refer to God. Kabbalists know that none areGod’s actual name; they’re just terms that help humans to begin to grasp thenature of God. All the names of God are considered sacred, and Kabbalistictradition urges great hesitation when pronouncing or writing them. The followingis a summary of various names of God, as known and used by Kabbalists:bullet [Images/check.png] YHVH: Sometimes referred to by scholars as theTetragrammaton or the four-letter name of God, this name of God is oftenconsidered the most important of God’s names. The four letters that make up thisname are yud, hey, vav, and hey. Kabbalistic tradition forbids the pronunciationof this term unless one is the High Priest in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem onthe holy day of Yom Kippur. Additionally, it’s believed that the correctpronunciation of this four-letter name of God has been lost; Hebrew onlyincludes consonants and not vowels, so a precise pronunciation is somewhat of amystery. However, the four letter name of God is often transliterated as Yahweh.bullet [Images/check.png] Hashem (hah-shem): Modern Kabbalists often use thedesignation Hashem, which means “the Name,” to refer to God. Paradoxically,Kabbalists often avoid speaking God’s name by calling God “the Name.”bullet [Images/check.png] Adonai (ah-doe-noy): This term that appears in everyKabbalah blessing is technically the plural form of “my Lord.” According totradition, the pronunciation of this name is forbidden unless it’s used inprayer. When one reads this name of God outside of prayer, one usually replacesit with Hashem.bullet [Images/check.png] Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh (eh-yeh ah-share eh-yeh): Thisphrase, which appears in the book of Exodus (3:14), is often translated as “Iwill be Who I will be” or “I am that I am.” According to the Torah, it’s theprecise response given when Moses asks God for His name.bullet [Images/check.png] El (el): A designation for “God,” it’s often pairedwith other terms, such as El Elyon (God Most High), El Olam (the EverlastingGod), and El Gibbor (the God of Strength). El also appears as the suffix of manyof the names of angels (such as Gabriel and Raphael) because they’re messengersfor God (see Chapter 8).bullet [Images/check.png] Elohim (el-oh-heem): Frequently found in the Torah,this name of God is grammatically a plural form and, because it can also betranslated as “judges,” it refers to God’s attribute of justice.bullet [Images/check.png] Shaddai (shah-die): Sometimes Shaddai appears byitself, and sometimes it’s expressed in combination with El. Often translated as“Almighty” and “Guardian,” Shaddai connects to the sense of God as protector. Itis interesting to note that when a Kabbalist puts a mezuzah (meh-zuz-ah) on hisor her doorpost, the housing for the mezuzah frequently has the Hebrew letterShin on it, standing for the name Shaddai; the mezuzah taps into the idea ofShaddai as protector in that the mezuzah is placed on the doorpost of a home asa kind of amulet for protection. Shaddai is also seen as an acronym for thethree Hebrew words Shomer Daltot Yisroel, which mean “Guardians of the doors ofIsrael.”bullet [Images/check.png] Yah: This name for God is taken from the first twoletters of the Tetragrammaton (see the first name in this list). Interestingly,Yah is the source of the Rastafarian name for God, Jah, which is heard incontemporary reggae music.bullet [Images/check.png] Tsva’ot (tzih-vah-oht): This name, which means “host,”appears often in the prophetic literature, not in the Five Books of Moses. It’sused in the sense that God is the Host of creation. Tsva’ot also implies thatall the details of creation are connected to God in the sense that they’re God’sarmy.bullet [Images/check.png] HaMakom (hah-mah-comb): Kabbalists frequently refer tothe universe as residing in the place of God and use the term HaMakom to referto that place with a capital “P.”WRITING THE NAMES OF GODKabbalistic tradition doesn’t take the names of God casually. Writing the namesof God isn’t prohibited, but erasing or defacing God’s names is. To be on thesafe side, Kabbalists avoid writing any of God’s names unless it’s absolutelynecessary. In fact, when any of the sacred names of God appear in print,Kabbalists avoid defacing the paper to the extent that old, worn-out prayerbooks and other sacred texts are buried instead of discarded in the trash. Forcenturies, Kabbalists have maintained geniza (geh-knee -zah; cemeteries) for oldtexts containing the names of God.Often, to avoid writing an exact name of God, a Kabbalists replaces letters orsyllables in the exact name; the substitution produces a name that isn’taccurate. For example:bullet [Images/check.png] Adonai becomes Hashem or Ahdoshem.bullet [Images/check.png] Elohim becomes Elokim (when it isn’t used contextuallyto refer to human judges).bullet [Images/check.png] Hallelujah becomes Hallelukah.On a related note, Kabbalists don’t pronounce these names accurately or fullyunless they’re being said for sacred purposes. Of course, when a teacher isteaching his or her students to pray or to read sacred texts, saying the fullnames accurately is permissible for the sake of accurate education.Kabbalistic tradition requires that the following seven names of God be givenspecial care by scribes who write sacred scrolls:bullet [Images/check.png] Elbullet [Images/check.png] Elohimbullet [Images/check.png] Adonaibullet [Images/check.png] Yud, Hey, Vav, Heybullet [Images/check.png] Ehyeh Asher Ehyehbullet [Images/check.png] Shaddaibullet [Images/check.png] Tsva’otWHY DOES GOD HAVE SO MANY NAMES?Kabbalists understand that God is unnamable and that no name can adequatelydescribe God or do justice to God. In some Kabbalistic texts, God is referred toas “The Infinite, Blessed is He.” This is a paradoxical name because it uses theword “infinite” and also uses a word that is quite finite, “He.” (Kabbalistsknow that God is without gender, but there’s no neutral pronoun in Hebrew, so“he” is often used when referring to God.) “The Infinite, Blessed is He” impliesthat God is both near and far, yet this name, too, falls short, as does everyother name for God.Even though no name does God justice, in Kabbalistic tradition, God has anynumber of names, each reflecting the human experience of God. Some of theseadditional names arebullet [Images/check.png] Strong Onebullet [Images/check.png] Our Father, Our Kingbullet [Images/check.png] The Creatorbullet [Images/check.png] God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacobbullet [Images/check.png] God the strong onebullet [Images/check.png] Truthbullet [Images/check.png] Endless, Infinitebullet [Images/check.png] Shepherd of Israelbullet [Images/check.png] The Holy One, Blessed be Hebullet [Images/check.png] Holy One of Israelbullet [Images/check.png] Shield of Abrahambullet [Images/check.png] The Lord will providebullet [Images/check.png] The Lord that healsbullet [Images/check.png] The Lord our Bannerbullet [Images/check.png] The Lord our Peacebullet [Images/check.png] The Lord my Shepherdbullet [Images/check.png] The Lord our Righteousnessbullet [Images/check.png] Rock of IsraelRemember [Images/Remember.jpg]Kabbalists believe that there’s no end to the number of names for God. As isoften the case in Kabbalah, this idea is a paradox: Even though no name isadequate and God is considered unnamable, God has an infinite number of names."},{"pageContent":"PART VTHE PART OF TENS[Images/915904 fgCN05.jpg]In this part . . .Elsewhere in this book, I discuss the Ten Commandments as well as the tenfundamental forces in the universe, but those aren’t the only “tens” in theworld of Kabbalah.

A number ofthe myths about Kabbalah concern themselves with restricting the study ofKabbalah to certain individuals and excluding others from its study. Otherpopular myths about Kabbalah have to do with the commercialization of Kabbalahin recent years as well as simply what Kabbalah is and what it isn’t. Thischapter lets me play myth-buster and set you straight on the top ten myths aboutKabbalah.YOU HAVE TO BE A MANAnybody who examines the traditional Jewish texts that have been central toKabbalah for centuries can see that men and women are viewed through differentlenses. Traditional religious responsibilities, restrictions, and customsreflect many different roles for men and women in the family as well as inritual life.But ultimately, Kabbalah is just as available to women as to men. I only have tolook to my own family experience for proof of this point. I have a son and twodaughters; both of my daughters graduated from Jewish high schools and haveshared with me repeatedly that Kabbalistic ideas were regularly taught in theirschools. Over the years, I’ve heard the stories, customs, lessons, and insightsgrown out of Kabbalistic tradition that were shared with them by their teachersand rabbis. And I’m not just referring to an occasional tidbit of Kabbalah hereand there. Jewish education for girls is taken quite seriously. I can havein-depth, high-level theological discussions with both of my daughters (andwe’ve been having them since they were in middle school!).The bottom line is that you don’t have to be a man to study Kabbalah. I’ve.studied Kabbalah with authentic Jewish teachers who teach Kabbalah to both womenand men all the time.YOU HAVE TO BE MARRIEDMarriage is an important institution in Kabbalistic tradition, and the sanctityof marriage is a given for the Kabbalist. Getting married is considered both asocial and a spiritual achievement. A person’s status rises upon marriagebecause the Kabbalist believes that each person has half a soul and needs tofind and connect with the other half to achieve a certain level of wholeness.The person who’s privileged to receive such a high level of wholeness hassomething of an exalted status for the Kabbalist, but marriage isn’t aprerequisite for Kabbalah study.You may be wondering why someone would even suggest that one has to be marriedin order to study Kabbalah. One reason is because Kabbalah does, in fact,require a certain level of maturity, and marriage usually imparts some maturitybecause of the wholeness it creates.One doesn’t have to be married to study Kabbalah, but the more mature, stable,and experienced a person is, the better able he or she is to explore the mostprofound notions about the meaning of life and death, good and evil, and painand suffering. The question of whether a student should wait to study Kabbalahuntil he or she is mature enough has long been a concern in Kabbalistictradition. It would be foolish to attempt the study of a difficult subjectwithout the proper prerequisites, but what does it take to be a mature studentwho is ready to study Kabbalah?bullet [Images/check.png] Knowledge of the ten sefirot (see Chapter 4)bullet [Images/check.png] Basic knowledge of the stories in the Torah: Forexample, knowledge of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wivesSarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah, is essential. These seven people are majorcharacters in stories that Kabbalists study and refer to on a regular basis.bullet [Images/check.png] Being rooted in both law as well as ideas (orconcepts): For the Kabbalist, the study of Kabbalah is never only theoretical.An important distinction that many scholars have noted about the differencebetween Kabbalah and other forms of mysticism is that Kabbalah isn’t just adiscussion of ideas; instead, it’s a constant effort to connect those ideas tothis world. From ritual acts to social behavior, everything a Kabbalist does isrooted in an ancient tradition that’s constantly looking for ways to expressitself in life. The giving of charity, acts of kindness, child-rearing,traditional celebration of the Sabbath and holidays, observance of ritual law inall realms (including eating, sleeping, and sexual behavior), and relations inthe marketplace are all governed by the individual’s participation in theancient process making an effort to remain conscious and to connect everybreath, action, and thought to the Infinite One. A Kabbalist needs to be rootedin the knowledge and practice of Jewish law as a perquisite to the explorationof esoteric and transcendent ideas or concepts.bullet [Images/check.png] Dedication: Kabbalah isn’t a fad or a hobby. It isn’ta self-help craze or a cult. And it isn’t some far-out superstition. Kabbalahrequires seriousness, commitment, perseverance, kindness, and endurance. Just asone doesn’t dabble as a brain surgeon, Kabbalists must dedicate time, knowledge,and commitment to master the art and science of Kabbalah.Can someone pick up a book of Kabbalah and randomly stumble upon an insight orpiece of wisdom of value? Yes, of course. But unless that person commits toKabbalah, he or she can’t in honesty claim to be a Kabbalist. Basically, it justisn’t possible to dabble in Kabbalah.bullet [Images/check.png] Working with a teacher: Kabbalah is largely an oraltradition passed on from one generation to the next. The Kabbalistic texts oftenaren’t clear enough to be meaningful unless the person studying them is aided bythe commentary of a living Kabbalist. Kabbalistic wisdom doesn’t apply in thesame way to every person, so a student needs the insight of a teacher to get themost out of his or her study.Certainly one can find a lot of information in books, and many of the growingnumber of books on Kabbalah are profoundly insightful and informative. In fact,I’ve been studying five such books on a constant basis for many years. I trulybelieve that I’ve learned much from my own study in solitude with these greatvolumes of Kabbalah in English, but nothing matches an encounter with acontemporary teacher who can offer his or her special guidance or blessings in away that a book never can.YOU HAVE TO BE AN ORTHODOX JEWThis myth is rooted in the reasonable idea of prerequisites. As with many of theother myths in this chapter, the trend in Kabbalistic history is to require thatthe serious student be rooted in tradition, experienced with the broad range oftraditional practices, and mature and knowledgeable enough to grasp andcreatively participate in discussions of basic and complex ideas. But being anOrthodox Jew doesn’t guarantee any of these skills or abilities.The rigors of Orthodox life require a great deal of knowledge and ongoing study,both of which are important prerequisites for the serious student. But oneeasily can be an Orthodox Jew without understanding and insight, just as one canbe far from the tradition of Orthodoxy and yet have the personality traits andthe talents to both study and teach Kabbalah.YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST BE JEWISHMake no mistake about it: Kabbalah is the theology of the Jewish people and hasbeen seen and accepted as such for at least the last 500 years. Its symbols,values, customs, and history are all part of the Jewish experience. The greatKabbalists were all practicing traditional Jews, and each held encyclopedicknowledge of Jewish tradition. Their behavior reflected that tradition.Throughout history, people have made attempts to mix Kabbalistic ideas withother approaches and philosophies and call these efforts Kabbalah. For example,a Christian Kabbalah that borrowed freely from the Kabbalistic tradition of theJewish people emerged as recently as the last few centuries in Kabbalistichistory. Best described as watered-down Kabbalah, Christian Kabbalah certainlynever retains authentic Kabbalah’s fundamental requirement of being rooted inritual law and traditional religious behavior.Warning(bomb) [Images/Warning(bomb).jpg]You can go into any spiritual bookstore or the spiritual section of a generalbookstore and find books that claim to teach Kabbalah and sometimes evenexplicitly refer to Christian Kabbalah. These efforts may or may not be worthyof study, but they certainly aren’t authentic representations of Kabbalistictradition.FromMyTeacher [Images/FromMyTeacher.jpg]But does the student of Kabbalah need to be Jewish? The answer is “no.” Books,lectures, classes, and magazine articles about Kabbalah are available toeveryone, not just Jews. And anyone can fall victim to misinformation anddistortions of the subject. As one of my Kabbalah teachers says, “There is somuch misinformation available about Kabbalah that teachers of Kabbalah almosthave an obligation today to write accurate books on Kabbalistic tradition.”This, along with the widespread access to information throughout the world,makes any restriction absurd.However, there’s a profound difference between the way a Jewish person relatesto Kabbalah and the way a person who isn’t Jewish relates to it. TraditionalKabbalistic belief places a heavy burden on the Jewish people; the traditiondoesn’t require the same of someone who isn’t Jewish. The more a Jewish personreads, learns, and understands the obligations imposed upon Jews by thetradition, the more his or her obligation grows.According to biblical tradition, the Jewish people are to view themselves as “anation of priests.” This notion is often referred to in shorthand as “the chosenpeople.” From the outside, the notion of the chosen people seems strange untilone realizes that the term “chosen” doesn’t mean greater status but rathergreater responsibility for learning and performing the divine commandments. Aspriests in the world, the Jewish people relate to everything as sacred. Soalthough you don’t have to be Jewish to study Kabbalah, for a Jewish person,studying Kabbalah is learning the way the Jewish family has sought to understandGod for many centuries.YOU HAVE TO BE OVER 40One can trace a tendency throughout Kabbalistic history to put off the study ofKabbalah until after a student masters the basics of Jewish learning andtradition. Kabbalists often refer to the following passage (Ethics of theFathers 5:24) in the Mishnah (see Chapter 13):At five years (the age is reached for the study of the) Scripture, at ten for(the study of) the Mishnah, at thirteen for (the fulfillment of) thecommandments, at fifteen for (the study of) the Talmud, at eighteen formarriage, at twenty for seeking (a livelihood), at thirty for (entering intoone’s full) strength, at forty for understanding, at fifty for counsel, at sixty(a man attains) old age, at seventy the hoary head, at eighty (the gift ofspecial) strength, at ninety (he bends beneath) the weight of years, at ahundred he is as if he were already dead and had passed away from the world.Many books about Kabbalah refer to a requirement that a student of Kabbalahneeds to be over 40, but no such absolute age requirement exists. Some of thegreat sages in Jewish history mastered Kabbalah at a young age, whereas othersnever felt ready to enter into its study. The greatest Kabbalist who ever lived,Rabbi Isaac Luria (known as the Ari), died at the age of 39. He never evenreached the age of 40.Even though there’s no age requirement for Kabbalah students, Kabbalistictradition is much more welcoming to the student who has done the properpreparation in order to enter the spiritual realms of Kabbalah.YOU HAVE TO BUY EXPENSIVE BOOKS IN HEBREWOver the past several years, I’ve been asked many times whether I think thatthere’s any truth to the notion being perpetuated by a major merchandiser ofnew-age Kabbalah that merely having a Hebrew set of the multivolume holy work,the Zohar, in one’s home will bring good fortune.I’m a book person. I have over 3,000 books in my home collection, I’ve beeninvolved with Jewish book publishing for over 25 years, and I’ve served as alibrarian in addition to authoring several books. The presence of the books thatsurround me in my home, both those that I’ve read and those that I haven’t,unquestionably enhance my life. As one of my teachers put it, “Just the title ofa book and the aesthetics of its design are sometimes enough to have greatimpact on a room and its inhabitants.”The presence of a holy book in the home has a positive influence on itsresidents, but Kabbalah students aren’t required to stock their shelves withexpensive sets of Hebrew books. And purchasing such books if one can’t affordthem is certainly out of order. No amount of potential good luck can justifyputting oneself in financial jeopardy by buying books or anything else.Kabbalists throughout the centuries have studied the legal area of law thatdeals with protecting oneself and not putting oneself in jeopardy — physically,emotionally, or economically. Kabbalists often rely on the libraries of localJewish study houses to supplement their holdings, so that, ultimately, they ownsome and share some.That said, one of my Kabbalah teachers said, “Simply to bring a few great Jewishbooks into one’s living room, even without opening them, may very well do somegood.” And Kabbalists do believe in the power of the Hebrew letter, merely as itsits on a page. It’s a time-honored belief among Kabbalists that if one merelypasses her eye over certain passages in Hebrew or Aramaic, she can receive thetext’s blessings. Similarly, anyone who has ever been privileged to be in asynagogue and close to an open Torah (especially someone who’s asked to readfrom the Torah or offer a blessing at the reading of the Torah) knows theawesome look of the Torah scroll. One need not know a letter of the Hebrewalphabet or a word in its vocabulary in order to feel the power of the HebrewTorah scroll.YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW A DRESS CODEIf you were able to look at portraits of each of the leading Kabbaliststhroughout history, you would notice that they were all male and all had beardsand wore head coverings. In the world of Hasidism today, where the study ofKabbalah is alive and well, beards are common, and men study while wearing a hator scull cap.Does this mean that if you’re a man you have to follow suit? I’d say no. Growinga beard certainly isn’t a requirement for Kabbalah study.As far as head coverings go, in Jewish tradition, wearing a head covering is areminder of God’s presence. Some men even wear two head coverings at the sametime (a skull cap covered by a hat) symbolizing the two sefirot of theintellect, Chochmah and Binah (see Chapter 4).So is a head covering required? On the one hand, you would never see a man in atraditional house of study or synagogue without one. Traditional Kabbalistswould surely agree that covering one’s head is as appropriate when studying fromholy texts as it is when entering a holy space. But as my teacher insists, “allor nothing” is a false dilemma. It’s unreasonable to take on every custom andlaw at once. You can surely pick up a book that teaches about Kabbalah and learnfrom it without your head being covered. And I’m confident that God hears allprayers regardless of what you’re wearing on your head — or any other part ofyour body, for that matter.Many people have also heard of a custom of wearing a red string tied around thewrist. This custom is often linked to the tomb of the matriarch Rachel inIsrael, where you can obtain and wear a red string cut from long strands thathave been wrapped seven times around the tomb. The red string is then made intoa bracelet that’s worn as a protective segula (seh-goo -lah; amulet). Somespeculate that the red string has some positive impact because it can inspirethe wearer to improve his or her character traits by recalling the finequalities of the biblical Rachel.Some say that wearing a red string wards off the evil eye. The basic idea of theevil eye is that a person’s evil glance has power. There’s no physical evidenceof such a phenomenon, but to me it isn’t a terribly far-fetched notion. Aperson’s evil glance or evil eye may not provoke absolute cause and effect inthe world, but the negative thoughts and emotions behind those glances are real.The great sages of Kabbalah designated these glances as the evil eye, or ayinharah (ah -yin hah -rah).Bottom line: Although there’s certainly nothing wrong with donning the redstring, it’s not a requirement for studying Kabbalah.YOU HAVE TO KNOW HEBREWYou don’t have to be an expert in the complexities and beauty of Hebrew in orderto be a Kabbalist. Nonetheless, it’s absolutely true that unless you knowHebrew’s complex grammar, whole areas of Kabbalistic teachings remain off-limitsto you because the unique nature of Hebrew grammar expresses some of the mostsublime ideas of Kabbalah.But it would be inconceivable to begin studying Kabbalah in-depth without someknowledge of Hebrew. Even a basic knowledge of the ABCs — aleph, bet, gimmel —is a big help. For example, the details in the Five Books of Moses as well asother sacred texts are based on the notion that every Hebrew letter has anumerical equivalent; aleph = 1, bet = 2, gimmel = 3, and so on. This system iscalled gematria (see Figure 17-1). Often, Kabbalists will offer fascinatinginterpretations of sacred texts by using this system. Many Jewish amulets havebeen based on the numerical value of Hebrew letters as well. For example, anamulet might have the numerical equivalent of a lucky Hebrew word or phrase onit.Figure 17-1: Every Hebrew letter has a numerical equivalent. There are nonumbers in Hebrew; just this system.Figure 17-1: Every Hebrew letter has a numerical equivalent. There are nonumbers in Hebrew; just this system. [Images/915904 fg1701.jpg]Even the shapes of the Hebrew letters are objects of study for Kabbalists. Andthe name of each letter also carries significance. For example, the Hebrewletter bet, the second Hebrew letter, means “house.” The shape of the letter betindeed looks like a house with one side open. For the Kabbalist, this letterreflects a powerful lesson about Abraham, who dwelled in a tent that was open onall sides so that he could eagerly go out and greet guests. That gesture ofgoing out to greet guests relates to the sefirah of Chesed, which Abrahamembodies. In other words, a simple drawing of the most primitive house with oneside open becomes a reference point to the understanding of the wisdom ofChesed, giving, outpouring, charity, and acts of kindness, all of which areexpanding outward, just as the sefirah of Chesed implies.Students shouldn’t be discouraged by the close relationship between Kabbalah andHebrew, though. One of the greatest Kabbalists who ever lived, the illustriousRabbi Akiva, is said to have begun learning the ABCs in Hebrew at the age of 40!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18TEN GREAT KABBALISTS IN HISTORYIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Touching on great biblical figuresbullet [Images/arrow.png] Getting to know history’s greatest rabbisbullet [Images/arrow.png] Exploring the fundamentals of Kabbalah with acontemporary rabbiThe fact that “Kabbalah” means “to receive” implies that Kabbalah is a traditionthat’s passed from one generation and received by the next. The generations haveproduced hundreds, if not thousands, of great Kabbalists, many of whom are knownnot only by their names but by the books they wrote.In this chapter, I explore ten “great” Kabbalists. To limit the list of greatKabbalists to ten is to distort the fact that Kabbalistic tradition hasflourished throughout the world and throughout the centuries. But my editorsasked for ten, so ten it is (and I snuck in a few additional greats). I’vechosen individuals who I think have particularly special significance in thehistory of Kabbalah.ADAMStudents of Kabbalah say that the truths of Kabbalah were known to Adam.Tradition teaches that he knew more than anyone would ever know and passed hisknowledge on to his descendants, including Hanoch and Methuselah (Genesis 5:21).Hanoch and Methuselah were the teachers of Noah, and Noah taught hisdescendants, including Abraham, who studied in the school of Noah’s son, Shem.Abraham also sent his son Isaac to study there, and Isaac sent his son Jacob tostudy with Shem and with Ever, Shem’s great-grandson. Jacob’s name was changedto Israel, and the Children of Israel, the Jewish people, received the wisdom ofKabbalah.Adam was the first person. Period. He appears in the very first chapters of theBible and is considered to be the father of all humankind. That makes him prettyimportant. But there’s more to Adam’s story.THE ULTIMATE SOULGod didn’t first create Adam and then Eve from Adam, as is usually understood,but rather, the first human being was a dual male/female creature. God split thehuman into two halves representing Adam and Eve. As a result of the originalseparation, Kabbalistic tradition represents that each human is in some way onlyhalf a soul and that part of one’s task in life is to locate the other half, tomerge with it, and to emulate God by becoming one.The implication of this image is reflected in the traditional Jewish weddingceremony. When two individuals marry, Kabbalists believe that the souls of thebride and groom merge and become one.Kabbalistic tradition also teaches that each individual in the world is really apart of the original Adam and that, in reality, there’s only one soul in theworld. In other words, on one level, each person is half a soul that must findits other half. But on another level, each person is a tiny spark of a soul, andthe human family together constitutes one great soul, the soul of Adam.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]The Talmud asks, “Why did God create one man rather than create many individualsthroughout the world?” The answer given is that God created one man so thatnobody could say, “My ancestor is greater than your ancestor.” In other words,Kabbalistic tradition urges everyone to see themselves as part of one largehuman family.THE FIRST BEINGAdam’s significance in Kabbalah also comes from the notion known as Adam Kadmon(ah -dum kahd -mun; the primordial human). For Kabbalists, the biblical figureAdam is Adam Kadmon, the first being to emerge in the universe.One of the ideas found in the Bible and represented throughout Kabbalistictradition is that the primordial person, Adam Kadmon, was created in the imageof God. The unusual wording of this idea in the Bible is found in the very firstchapter (Genesis 1:26): “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after ourlikeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over thebirds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over everycreeping thing that creeps upon the earth.”According to Kabbalah, this statement refers to man in the plural form — “letthem have dominion” — because the human form is a microcosm of the whole. Allthe aspects of the universe came together to create the human being. In fact, inKabbalistic tradition, the words “man” and “world” are often interchangeable.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]A frequently quoted verse from the Holy Scriptures found in the book of Job isthe phrase, “In my flesh I see God.” This phrase implies that the specific anddeliberate design of the human being, Adam Kadmon, reveals profound ideas aboutthe nature of the universe.The Kabbalistic definition of a human being is a creature that lives in theworlds of matter and spirit simultaneously. Adam was the first human being,having both a body and a soul, and this unique combination in the world formsthe basis of all the study and speculation about the nature of man.ABRAHAMThe patriarch Abraham holds great significance in Kabbalistic tradition. Perhapsmost important is that Abraham reminded the world that God is One. Unlike otherphilosophies and religions of the world that conceive of many Gods or no God,Abraham’s vision and realization of the oneness of God is a deep, fundamental,and profound one for the Kabbalist.The oneness of God is a difficult concept to understand, despite its seemingsimplicity. As the great Jewish philosopher Maimonides taught, “God is not twoor more, but one, unified in a way which surpasses any unity found in theworld.” In today’s world, many things are one, like one sun, one country calledthe United States, and so on. But the oneness of God is a different kind ofunity, one that’s outside of time and space. God is considered to be a simpleunified existence. This concept requires a lifetime of contemplation andmeditation and is addressed at length in Kabbalistic literature.Kabbalists address the question, “Why did God create the world?” If God indeedexists, what was God’s motive? One of the answers that Kabbalists emphaticallyindicate is incorrect is that God “needed” the world in some way. Kabbalistspoint out that the idea of God needing anyone or anything is impossible becauseit implies that God lacks something. Kabbalists conceive of God as being thewhole and perfect, so God couldn’t have created the world because of any need.An answer offered by Kabbalists as to why God created the world is that Godcreated the world in order to give pleasure to man, and God created the humanbeing in order to receive the most profound pleasure possible: knowledge of God.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Abraham is represented on the Tree of Life (the chart of the ten sefirot ), asthe sefirah of Chesed, which is expansiveness, outpouring, and giving (seeChapter 4). In a sense, the fundamental nature of Abraham as a giver reflectsthe divine impulse to create the world and to give pleasure to its inhabitants.According to many authorities, one of the most important Kabbalistic books,Sefer Yetzirah, was written by the patriarch Abraham (see Chapter 13). Otherssay that Abraham imparted the wisdom contained in Sefer Yetzirah and passed itdown from generation to generation, but Rabbi Akiva (see the next section)actually wrote it all down and formed it into the book that Kabbalists studynow.The Torah records that God offered Abraham the opportunity to participate in thecreation of a great nation and offered Abraham an opportunity for a specialblessing. Abraham accepted God’s offer, and this agreement between God andAbraham was signed and sealed through the ritual of the circumcision, known asbrit milah (brit mee-lah ). The word “brit” means “covenant,” and allKabbalists, male and female, enter a covenant with God. This covenant doesn’talways involve ritual circumcision (which only pertains to males); it may alsobe made through a conscious gesture to connect oneself with God always.A fundamental Kabbalistic notion is the belief that God tests humans. Kabbalistsbelieve that all the trials of life are sent from God and that the ultimatepurpose of these trials is to know God. An often repeated notion in Kabbalisticliterature is “Without Binah, there is no Da’at. ” This is translated as“Without understanding, there is no knowledge of God.” The impact of many trialson the part of the person who receives the trial is a great effort to try tograsp its meaning. Kabbalists use the sefirah of Binah in an effort tounderstand their lives and to grasp the ungraspable God.Abraham is the great representative of the concept of trials from God because,according to Kabbalistic tradition, Abraham experienced ten tests and perseveredthrough each one. The ten tests are as follows:1. God called to Abraham and urged him to leave the place in which he lived andto travel to the unknown.2. After God promised Abraham prosperity, God created a famine in the land ofCanaan. Abraham faced a feeling of abandonment (or possibly betrayal), but heheld onto his faith that God knew what He was doing.3. Abraham experienced what could be called “government-sponsored injustice” ashe faced the trials regarding his wife Sarah in Egypt.4. Abraham faced a war among the great kings of the time and had to cope withthe difficult political atmosphere.5. Abraham’s wife Sarah was seemingly unable to have children.6. Abraham was commanded to circumcise himself.7. Abraham experienced injustice at the hands of Avimelech, as recorded in theBible.8. Abraham’s concubine Hagar was sent away after she became pregnant.9. Abraham had to send his son Ishmael away.10. God commanded Abraham to bind and sacrifice his son Isaac.These tests, the details of which appear in the Torah, are reminiscent of thetrials that people face in life. Kabbalists work diligently on themselves in aneffort to know within their heart of hearts that all trials ultimately come fromGod and that, even when they have no idea of why God is doing what He is doing,there is a reason. That reason may be beyond the Kabbalist’s knowledge or evenability to understand, but ultimately the Kabbalist believes that everythingcomes from God.RABBI AKIVAEvery student of Torah sooner or later falls in love with Rabbi Akiva. RabbiAkiva was one of the greatest rabbis of all times and perhaps the greatest rabbiin the entire Rabbinic period of Jewish history (considered to be from 70 CE to500 CE).One of the remarkable aspects of Rabbi Akiva’s personal story is that that hedidn’t know the ABCs of Hebrew until he was 40 years old. According to theTalmud, before Rabbi Akiva was 40, he was an ignorant shepherd who was actuallyhostile toward religion in general and Jewish tradition in particular. But ayoung woman named Rachel, who was the daughter of one of the richest men inJerusalem, saw Akiva the shepherd and detected his great potential. Upon theirmeeting, Rachel said to Akiva that she would marry him if he promised todedicate himself to learning Torah. He agreed, and they were married.Unfortunately, her father was quite unhappy with the match and disowned her, notspeaking to her for over 24 years. The story ends happily with thereconciliation of father and daughter after Rachel’s father learned of thegreatness of Rabbi Akiva and, in turn, the insight that Rachel had into herhusband’s character, abilities, and potential.Rabbi Akiva is clearly the hero for all who decide late in life to return to thespiritual path. Rabbi Akiva started late in life and grew to the very pinnacleof spiritual development.Rabbi Akiva makes hundreds of appearances in Rabbinic literature and is known asone of the great mystics of Jewish history and tradition. In fact, a story thatevery Kabbalist is familiar with tells of four rabbis who entered an orchard.The Hebrew word for “orchard,” pardes (par-days ), is the source of the Englishword “paradise.” Pardes is also an acronym of four letters: p, r, d, and s, eachof which stands for a different level of Torah study.bullet [Images/check.png] The “p” of “pardes” stands for the Hebrew word p’shat(puh-shot), which indicates the literal meaning of a text.bullet [Images/check.png] The “r” stands for the Hebrew world remez (reh-mez;hint), which refers to those aspects of the Torah that aren’t offered to thereader explicitly but rather are hinted at. Some things in the text are impliedrather than stated explicitly.bullet [Images/check.png] The “d” stands for the Hebrew word d’rash (duh-rahsh)and indicates the message or the ethical or spiritual teaching that one canderive from the text.bullet [Images/check.png] The “s” stands for the Hebrew word sod (sowd; secret),which refers to the hidden, esoteric, Kabbalistic meaning embedded within theTorah text.As the story goes, four great rabbis — Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, Elisha ben Abuya,and Rabbi Akiva — entered the orchard or garden of Torah study individually.These four rabbis explored the greatest depths of the Torah and encountered themost sublime, esoteric teachings. What happened to the four rabbis indicates thedanger of mystical study.bullet [Images/check.png] Ben Azzai entered the mystical depths and died.bullet [Images/check.png] Ben Zoma entered the mystical depths and went crazy.bullet [Images/check.png] Elisha ben Abuya entered the mystical depths andbecame a heretic.bullet [Images/check.png] Rabbi Akiva, as the text indicates, “entered in peaceand left in peace.”What happened to Rabbi Akiva in this story and what happened to the other threerabbis is one basis for the explanation of why the study of Kabbalah has beendiscouraged over the centuries. When you enter a field of study that’s over yourhead, you risk becoming confused and alienated from the subject. A curriculummust be designed with a certain degree of logic in mind; you need to learn thebasics before entering deeper and more complex realms. If a student encounterscomplex Torah study prematurely, he or she may very well run away from it all.WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]Rabbi Akiva is also well known for a famous statement found in the Mishnah (mish-nah, see Chapter 13), the written record of the Oral Tradition passed on fromMoses at Mount Sinai to the present. The statement is, “All is foreseen, andfree will is given.” Needless to say, this statement is a paradox that refers toGod’s relationship to the world. On the one hand, God sees and knows everything:what was, what is, and what will be. On the other hand, God has given humans adivine spark of creativity and free will. If God knows what was, is, and willbe, how can humans possibly choose freely? Doesn’t the fact that God knows whatwill be imply that everything is in the cards? Kabbalists have meditated on thisparadox since time in memorial and continue to do so.Rabbi Akiva also is credited with the expression Gam zu l’tovah (gahm zooleh-toe- vah; everything is for the best), which I discuss in depth in Chapter5. This well-known expression is the basis of Kabbalistic faith in God. (RabbiAkiva’s teacher of 22 years, Rabbi Nachum Ish Gamzu, taught him this expression,but nevertheless, most students know the expression from Rabbi Akiva himself.)Kabbalists have much to learn from Rabbi Akiva, as evidence by the fact that heappears many times throughout the 63 volumes of the Talmud. He was the spiritualnourishment for thousands of disciples in his lifetime, and, in some ways, everyKabbalist and every Jew considers himself or herself to be a disciple of RabbiAkiva.RABBI SHIMON BAR YOCHAIRabbi Shimon Bar Yochai was a student of Rabbi Akiva and lived around the year135 CE. Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai was active in the revolt against the Romans andultimately was forced to flee when the Romans pursued him. Both he and his son,Rabbi Elazar ben Shimon, hid in a cave where, according to legend, they remainedfor 13 years studying the Torah, specifically the secret hidden esoteric levelof Torah study now known as Kabbalah. Rabbi Shimon wrote down the material thathe and his son generated and discussed during their 13 years of Torah study, andthat written material formed itself into the great Kabbalistic text known as theZohar (see Chapter 13).Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai was buried in the town of Meron, Israel; to this day,many people travel to Meron on a day on the Jewish calendar known as Lag b’Omer(lahg buh-oh -mehr). Lag b’Omer, which is the 33rd day of the counting of Omer(see Chapter 11), was the day Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai died. Every year on thisday, thousands visit Meron to study the Zohar, pray, and think about thegreatness of this extraordinary Kabbalist.Kabbalists tell a story that when Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai was on his deathbed,he began to teach Kabbalah to those around him, offering deep secrets ofKabbalistic tradition. He knew that it was his last day on earth, and he taughtand taught, hoping to fit as much teaching as possible into that one day. Legendhas it that a miracle occurred on that day: The Sun stood still and refused toset, and because of this, a fire began to burn around Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai’shouse. Custom has it that when pilgrims go to Meron on the 33rd day of the Omer,a great fire is rekindled again in his memory. Visitors to Meron see manybonfires on Lag b’Omer, and the custom is also performed on that day throughoutIsrael.RABBI ISAAC LURIA, THE HOLY ARIIt’s an undisputed fact of Kabbalistic history that the greatest Kabbalist ofall time was Rabbi Isaac Luria. The first three letters of Ashkenazi Rabbi Isaacare A-R-I, which forms an acronym for the Hebrew of his name “The Godly RabbiIsaac, but also is a Hebrew word in itself. The word ari (ah-ree ) means “lion.”And like the lion is the king of the jungle, the Ari is the undisputed king ofKabbalistic tradition.The Ari proved his genius at a young age as a student of great rabbis. Hetransformed Judaism in its entirety with his teachings about God, the creationof the world, and the metaphysics of existence, and by revealing the Kabbalisticmeanings of the holy days and rituals of Jewish life. His teachings spread farand reached every corner of the Jewish world. Many of the customs that he taughtbecame essential parts of Jewish life in general. Despite his immense influence,Rabbi Isaac Luria never wrote down his teachings. They were preserved by hismany students, the most important of whom was Rabbi Chaim Vital, a prolificwriter in the 16th and 17th centuries.The irony of ironies is that the Ari died when he was only 39 years old. Manyhave heard it said that one shouldn’t study Kabbalah before the age of 40. Butas I explain in Chapter 17, this isn’t a rule but rather a warning that one mustlearn the basics before exploring the depths of Kabbalistic tradition. But oneshould also remember that the greatest Kabbalist who ever lived, the Ari, didn’teven live to age 40. Clearly, the warning about not studying until one is 40years old isn’t meant to be a hard and fast rule.THE SHELAH HAKODESH, RABBI ISAIAH HOROWITZRabbi Isaiah Horowitz was born in Prague and died in the holy Kabbalistic cityof Tzfat. Throughout his life, he was the leader of many different Jewishcommunities throughout Europe.It’s common in Jewish history to refer to a person not by his actual name butrather by a great book he has written. In the case of Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz, hismasterpiece is Shnei Luchot HaBrit (sheh-nay loo-khowt hah-brit; the two tabletsof the covenant). The acronym for this Hebrew expression is Sh-L-H, which ispronounced she-luh. This acronym has become the more popular way of referring toRabbi Isaiah Horowitz.In fact, many people who know Rabbi Horowitz’s work and have studied it alltheir lives aren’t even aware of his real name. They refer to him as the Shelahor more commonly as the Shelah HaKodesh (sheh-luh hah-koe -desh; the HolyShelah).WordsOfWisdom [Images/WordsOfWisdom.jpg]The Shelah HaKodesh taught a Kabbalistic prayer that’s recited by someKabbalists today. What appears in Table 18-1 is an abridged version of thatprayer, which contains several of the major points of Kabbalists that I explainthroughout this book.Table 18-1 Prayer Taught by the Shelah HaKodesh Portion of Prayer TranslationYou were God before you created God created the universe, and God is theuniverse and You are God outside of time (see Chapter 16). after you created theuniverse. For all eternity You are God! You created Your world in order Godcreated humans to give them that man should know You. pleasure, and the greatestpleasure is to know God (see Chapter 6).

His influence was profound, and in some ways,he’s one of the fathers of the greatest revival movement in Jewish history, theHasidic movement, which is grounded in Kabbalah (see Chapter 3).On a personal note, I’ve done extensive genealogical research and discovered tomy great surprise and delight that I’m a direct descendent of the ShelahHaKodesh. My great-great-great grandfather, Rabbi Chaim Yosef Gottlieb, was arabbi who taught Kabbalah in Eastern Europe; he was a descendent of the ShelahHaKodesh on his mother’s side, so that makes me a direct descendent as well. Ihave to believe that, in the same way that the Shelah HaKodesh was known assomeone who popularized Kabbalah and spread its teachings throughout Poland andEastern Europe, Kabbalah For Dummies is my opportunity to bring the wisdom ofthe great Kabbalistic sages to those who are thirsty for spiritual nourishment.RABBI ISRAEL BAAL SHEM TOVRabbi Israel was born approximately 1698 in a small Ukrainian town near theRussian-Polish border. Legend has it that his parents, Eliezer and Sarah, werequite old at the time of his birth and that they died when he was quite young.According to the story, the last thing Rabbi Israel’s father said to him beforehis death was, “Fear nothing else but God.”The young Rabbi Israel grew up immersed in the study of Kabbalah and associatedwith many saintly people, including the masters of Kabbalah, who nourished himin the most profound way. When Rabbi Israel was 36 years old, he revealedhimself to the world and became known as a holy and righteous teacher.With this life change, he also acquired the name Baal Shem Tov (bah-ahl shemtowv; Master of the Good Name) because of his ability to use the names of God toperform miracles. (Although this title is rare, other people have held it aswell.)Rabbi Israel, the Baal Shem Tov, founded the Hasidic movement, a revolutionarymovement that was the greatest revivalist movement in the history of the Jewishpeople. The word hasid (khah-sid) means “pious one.” The core idea in theHasidic movement is the Baal Shem Tov’s interest in popularizing Kabbalah.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]The Baal Shem Tov’s teachings were mostly based on those of the Ari (see thesection “Rabbi Isaac Luria, the Holy Ari” earlier in this chapter). But the bigdifference between the Ari and the Baal Shem Tov is that the Ari’s Kabbalah wasmeant for a small core group of deeply pious individuals, whereas the Kabbalahof the Baal Shem Tov was intended for everyone, from the simplest person to thegreatest sages. He wanted everybody to be able to reap the spiritual rewards ofthe profound teachings of Kabbalah. The genius of the Baal Shem Tov was hisability to bring the most abstract and sublime ideas down to a level that anyonecould understand.A commonality between the Ari and the Baal Shem Tov is that is that neitherwrote down his teachings. In the case of the Baal Shem Tov, his leadingdisciple, Rabbi Yakov Yosef of Polonoye, began the dissemination of the BaalShem Tov’s teachings in a book called Toldot Yakov Yosef and continued thedissemination process with several other books. The Baal Shem Tov’s disciplesand their disciples to the present have written thousands of volumes that teachand expand upon his wisdom.The Baal Shem Tov died on the second day of Shavuot in the year 1760, but histeachings and influence not only live on but also have grown as the decades havepassed. His teachings and the movement that it spawned have had a major impacton Jewish practice and belief for all of Jewry throughout the world. Includedare the tens of thousands of Hasidim around the world who base their lives onthe teachings of the Baal Shem Tov, all of which are grounded in Kabbalah.THE VILNA GAONThe Hebrew term for “genius” is gaon (gah -own), and Rabbi Elijah, the Rabbi ofVilna in Lithuania, who was born in 1720, was known far and wide for his uniquegenius. Ultimately, he became known as the Vilna Gaon (the genius of Vilna). Hisgenius showed itself when he was very young; he was already giving publiclectures and classes when he was only 7 years old!Legend says that by age 7, the Vilna Gaon’s intellect had fully blossomed, andby the time he was 10, he was recognized as one of the great teachers of alltime. Legend also has it that for a time he took a vow of poverty and wanderedfrom town to town until he once again came back to the city of Vilna.The Vilna Gaon devoted his life to the study of Torah. He had a photographicmemory as well as a profound grasp of both the revealed Torah and the esotericTorah, and he was quite knowledgeable in secular fields of study, too. He wasalso known for his generosity and kindness as well as for his commentary on theTalmud and other texts, particularly in the realm of correcting mistakes thatscribes had made over the centuries.The Vilna Gaon was well-known as an opponent of some of the practices andperspectives of the Hasidic movement. He was wary of a number of changes inJewish practice that some of the great leaders of Hasidism enacted (see thepreceding section). His students and followers became known, mostly to Hasidim,as the mitnagdim (mit-nahg -deem; opponents). It’s an unfortunate and commonlyheld myth that mitnagdim are against Hasidism. Hasidic Jews and mitnagdim areactually well-integrated in Jewish life today. Mitnagdim are merely verytraditional Jews who don’t consider themselves Hasidic.It’s a surprise to many that, despite his great opposition to the Hasidicmovement, the Vilna Gaon was a well-known Kabbalist. In fact, he wrote perhapsthe greatest commentary on the mystical text Sefer Yetzirah (see Chapter 13).RABBI ADIN STEINSTALTZIn 1937, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz was born in Jerusalem into a secular family, andhe didn’t begin his serious Torah studies until he was a teenager. But hisreputation as a genius and profound teacher grew rapidly, and by the tender ageof 25, he was already teaching some of the elders in Jerusalem.Rabbi Steinsaltz reports that his parents, who were secular Jews inclined towardsocialism, were deep skeptics and brought him up to be one, too. As he hasquipped, “My mother was a skeptic, my father was a skeptic; they taught me howto be a skeptic. I am such a skeptic that I became skeptical of skepticism.”Rabbi Steinsaltz has done something in today’s generation that hasn’t been donein 1,000 years: He has written a comprehensive commentary on the entire 63volumes of the Talmud. Not since Rashi, the great biblical and Talmudiccommentator who lived around the year 1000, has any one individual written avast commentary on the entire Talmud that’s considered an unparalleled work ofgenius.Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Rabbi Steinsaltz is described by many as one of the most influential rabbis inmodern times, not only for his commentary on the Talmud but also for his timespent traveling throughout the world, teaching and lecturing and trying to bringJewish wisdom and Jewish sources to all comers. Rabbi Steinsaltz has beenteaching Kabbalah in Jerusalem and elsewhere for decades, and his books inEnglish are probably the best introductions to Kabbalah and Kabbalistic ideasavailable to the serious modern reader who’s prepared to invest significant timeand effort to absorb and understand his teachings. Lots of people (including me,with this book) write books “about” Kabbalah, but Rabbi Steinsaltz is one of fewwho writes books that are Kabbalah. His books represent authentic Kabbalistictradition.Among his most important Kabbalistic texts in English are The Thirteen PetalledRose (Basic Books), The Sustaining Utterance (Jason Aronson), The Long ShorterWay (Jason Aronson), In the Beginning (Jason Aronson), and The Candle of God(Jason Aronson). Any English language reader who wants to encounter authenticKabbalistic teachings by a contemporary master would do well to track down thesebooks. In particular, The Thirteen Petalled Rose explores the fundamental ideasthat hold up the entire edifice that is Kabbalah.WHAT? HOW COULD YOU HAVE LEFT OUT . . .I can just hear my friends, colleagues, teachers, students, and children now:“Why did you pick these people when you could have picked . . .?” So to calmthem down a little, here are ten more strong candidates for my list. If you’reinterested in Kabbalah, I strongly suggest that you check them out.bullet [Images/check.png] Rabbi Moshe Cordovero (1522–1570) was one of thegreatest Kabbalists of all time. At the age of 20, a “heavenly voice” told himto study Kabbalah. He’s the author of one of the classics of Kabbalah, PardesRimonim (Orchard of Pomegranates).bullet [Images/check.png] Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1864–1935) was the firstchief rabbi of modern Israel and the author of several highly regarded books,including Orot (Lights).bullet [Images/check.png] Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan (1934–1983) was an American rabbiand prolific author who was known to have a deep understanding of Kabbalah andmodern physics. He wrote many popular books, including Jewish Meditation: APractical Guide (Schocken Books), on a variety of meditative techniquesincluding mantra meditation (with suggested phrases and Bible verses to use asmantras), contemplation, visualization, and conversing with God.bullet [Images/check.png] Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh (1944–) is a popular teacherof Kabbalah in Israel today and a prolific writer. You can find more about hiswork and his teachings online, particularly at www.inner.org[http://www.inner.org].bullet [Images/check.png] Rabbi Joseph Karo (1488–1575) was author of the Codeof Jewish Law, which remains an authority. He was a great Kabbalist and one ofthe most influential sages in all of Jewish history.bullet [Images/check.png] Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi (1924–) is one of themost influential rabbis in the United States today. He’s generally consideredthe founder of the Jewish Renewal Movement (“a worldwide, transdenominationalmovement grounded in Judaism’s prophetic and mystical traditions”) and is theauthor of Paradigm Shift (Jason Aronson) as well as other books that express hisinnovative ideas. His teachings are rooted in Kabbalah.bullet [Images/check.png] Rabbi Nachman of Breslov (1772–1810), known as RebbeNachman, was one of the great Hasidic masters. His teachings, rooted inKabbalah, are widely distributed in books and pamphlets throughout the world byhis many disciples.bullet [Images/check.png] Rabbi Abraham Abulafia (1240–1290) developed anunusual approach to Kabbalah that’s sometimes called ecstatic Kabbalah orprophetical Kabbalah and involves meditative methods (using Hebrew letters andoften their numerical values) to achieve higher states of awareness.bullet [Images/check.png] Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi (1745–1812) was one ofthe leading Hasidic masters in history. He was a student of Rabbi Dovber ofMezeritch, the leading student of the Baal Shem Tov (see “Rabbi Israel Baal ShemTov” earlier in this chapter). Today, many Hasidim and others continue to studyhis masterpiece of Kabbalah, the Tanya, along with his other books, which areamong the most influential in all of Judaism.bullet [Images/check.png] Elie Wiesel (1928–) is best known as a recipient ofthe Nobel Prize for Peace and for his many deeply moving and profound books. Butas a teenager, he was a serious student of Kabbalah. He has continued hisstudies throughout his life, and his many spiritual insights appear in hisnovels and essays.GIVING MADONNA A BREAK (YES, THAT MADONNA)She certainly isn’t one of the greatest Kabbalists in history, but Madonna, theenormously gifted singer, actress, and show business personality, has probablydone more than anyone in the world in recent times to make the word “Kabbalah” afamiliar one. Madonna doesn’t represent herself as a master of Kabbalah — she’snever claimed that. What she has claimed, however, and what I respect her for,is that she’s interested in Kabbalah.Unfortunately, some writers and members of the press haven’t been kind to herwhen it comes to her Kabbalistic interests, and I’m eager to go on record hereand now to say that I’m disappointed in the press and in certain journalists andwriters who have taken her to task for her interest. Madonna has just as much aright as anyone to explore questions like “Who am I?,” “Where did I come from?,”and “Where am I going?” Madonna has just as much a right as anyone to exploreall kinds of philosophies and approaches to living with the hope of acquiringsome true wisdom to apply to life’s questions, puzzles, and riddles. And Madonnahas just as much a right as anyone to look at Jewish tradition with the hopethat it can offer insights and ideas that will serve her well. And apparently,that’s exactly what she’s done."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19TEN PLACES THAT KABBALISTS VISITIN THIS CHAPTERbullet [Images/arrow.png] Discovering the sacred places on the Kabbalistic mapbullet [Images/arrow.png] Paying one’s respects closer to homeKabbalisticly speaking, holiness is everywhere, but some places have a specialstatus within the world of Kabbalah. This chapter covers some of the highlightsof a Kabbalistic travelogue.JERUSALEMWhen Kabbalists pray three times a day, they face toward Jerusalem. Jerusalem,which archaeological findings indicate has existed since the third millenniumBCE, was the capital of the Jewish kingdoms of Israel, Judah, and Judea duringboth the First and Second Temple periods.The name Jerusalem likely comes from a contraction of two words:bullet [Images/check.png] Yerusha (yeh-roo-sha; heritage or inheritance)bullet [Images/check.png] Salem (sah-lem; whole or peace)According to the book of Genesis in the Bible, shalem is the original name ofJerusalem (Genesis 14:18).HISTORICAL JERUSALEMAccording to Jewish tradition, Jerusalem was founded by the ancestors ofAbraham, Shem, and Ever. In approximately 1000 BCE, King David conqueredJerusalem and declared it the capital of the kingdom of Israel. In 960 BCE, KingSolomon built the First Temple there, but in 596 BCE, the Babylonians conqueredthe city, destroyed the city walls, and burned the Temple.Eventually, the Jews who fled Jerusalem were allowed to return to the holy cityand rebuild the Temple. Jerusalem was the capital of Judah and remained centralto Jewish worship for centuries.After the Second Temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE, any hopes for thereestablishment of Jewish sovereignty in the land were dashed. In 135 CE, theRomans, under Hadrian, suppressed the Bar Kochva uprising (known as the fall ofBethar), killing 580,000 Jews. The Romans ran a plow over Jerusalem tocompletely destroy the Holy City and banned the Jews from living there.Jerusalem didn’t serve as the capital of any state until 1948, when the modernstate of Israel was established with Jerusalem as its capital. In spite of thecity’s turbulent history, Jews have been living in Jerusalem continuously forover two millennia.Prayers of remembrance and longing for Jerusalem appear a number of times in theJewish liturgy that Kabbalists have recited for centuries. Three times each day,Kabbalists recite traditional prayers that include the hope that Jerusalem andthe line of King David are restored.JERUSALEM TODAYToday, visitors to Jerusalem see a crossroads of three major religioustraditions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Particularly visible are the greatnumber of Hasidim who live and worship in the holy city.Generally speaking, the fact that Jerusalem was the site of both Holy Temples iswhat makes it so central to Jews. The Torah, for example, defines the threemajor holy days of Sukkot, Pesach, and Shavuot as part of the Pilgrim Festivals,when Jews from far and wide came to Jerusalem to participate in the spiritualrituals performed in the Holy Temple. Kabbalists today hope for and imagine arebuilding of the Holy Temple on the Temple Mount site of the previous temples.Another interesting site in Jerusalem is the Ramban Synagogue. The famousKabbalist, Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman, known by the acronym Ramban (rahm-bahn ),established a synagogue on Mount Zion that moved to the Old City of Jerusalem in1400. The original columns of the synagogue are still standing, and today, thesynagogue functions on a regular basis and has become a popular site for thoseexploring Jewish history in general and the history of Kabbalah in particular.The most famous pilgrimage site in Jerusalem today is the Western Wall, whichwas a huge retaining wall for the temple that was constructed on the TempleMount. Great numbers of visitors to Israel are drawn to this ancient wall andexpress their heartfelt prayers there, as Jews have done for many centuries.TZFATThe city of Tzfat (tzeh-faht ) is located in northern Israel in the mountains ofthe upper Galilee. Tzfat is considered to be one of the four Jewish holy citiesin Israel, together with Jerusalem, Hebron and Tiberias. (You may findreferences to the city spelled Safed, Zefat, Tsfat, Zfat, Safad, Safes, Safet,and Tzfat.)According to one legend, Tzfat is where Shem (the son of Noah) and Ever (thegrandson of Noah) established a yeshiva in which the patriarch Jacob studied formany years.The city flourished in the 1500s, when many great Jewish scholars and mysticsmade Tzfat their home following the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492.Tzfat functioned as an important spiritual center during this time.Some of the greatest Kabbalists called the city home, including Rabbi IsaacLuria (the Ari); Rabbi Shlomo Alkabetz, who wrote the famous song recited onFriday nights, “L’cha Dodi”; and Rabbi Joseph Karo, the author of the ShulchanAruch (shool-khan ah-rukh ); the Code of Jewish Law). As well, many of the mostholy people in the history of Kabbalah are buried in and around Tzfat. Forexample, an ancient Jewish cemetery located in the city houses the tomb of thegreat Kabbalist Rabbi Isaac Luria as well as the graves of Rabbi Moshe benZimra, Rabbi Shlomo Alkabetz, Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, and Rabbi Joseph Karo. Onecan also find in Tzfat the tombs of Shem and Ever, the two descendents of Noah,and near Tzfat is the cave where the students of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai areburied.You may be interested to know that the first printing press in the Middle Eastwas set up in Tzfat, and in 1578, the first Hebrew book printed in Israel waspublished in Tzfat.Unfortunately, Tzfat has been the victim of some serious earthquakes as well asplagues and attacks. Yet, in modern times, Tzfat has seen a revival, with manyimmigrants to modern Israel settling in the historic city. Today, Tzfat has anactive community of returnees to Judaism, known as baalei teshuva (bah-ah -layteh-shoo -vah) and several major centers for the study of Kabbalah, as well asartists who base their work on core images in Kabbalah, such as David Friedman’sstudio presents. The beautiful mountain setting of Tzfat and its magnificentviews make it a beautiful place to visit or to live.MERON, ISRAELThe town of Meron, Israel, contains the tombs of some of the greatestpersonalities of the Rabbinic period, including Rabbi Yochanan haSandlar, RabbiShimon Bar Yochai, Hillel, Shammai, and many of the students of Hillel andShammai. These tombs have been pilgrimage spots for centuries.Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, who was one of the great rabbis of the Rabbinic(Talmudic) period, is traditionally thought of as the author of the supremeKabbalistic work, the Zohar. He was one of the greatest disciples of Rabbi Akivaand earned a reputation as a miracle worker.It’s generally believed that Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai died on the holy day of LagB’Omer (lahg beh-oh -mare). Because of this legend, a custom developed over thecenturies to observe and celebrate the anniversary date of Rabbi Shimon BarYochai’s death in Meron (his burial place as well as the burial place of his sonRabbi Elazar bar Shimon). This custom is as popular as ever today. Each year,you can see thousands of pilgrims out picnicking and celebrating in and aroundthe city of Meron on this auspicious anniversary of the great sage’s death.HOLY GRAVESITES IN THE HOLY LANDVisiting the gravesites of holy individuals has been a Jewish custom since timeimmemorial. The Bible, the Talmud, and the Zohar contain many stories indicatingthe importance of visiting and praying at the graves of the great holy sages.For example, a Rabbinic legend records that the patriarch Jacob buried his wifeRachel on the side of the road at Beit Lechem (Bethlehem) in order that the sitecould be visited and prayers could be offered to God based on the great meritsof the matriarch Rachel.In Hebrew, a cemetery is often called a Beit HaChayim (bait hah-khah -yeem;house of life) based on the spiritual idea that the faithful are considered“living” even after they’re dead. A Talmudic teaching says that studying theteachings of a sage at his gravesite is customary and that, when this is done,the lips of the sage move along with the lips of the person who’s currentlystudying his words. On a similar note, the Zohar contains a teaching that whenone prays at holy gravesites, the souls of the holy people can intercede onbehalf of the one who prays.Throughout the land of Israel are many sites containing the graves of thegreatest personalities in Jewish history. The Cave of the Patriarchs, forexample, located in Chevron (Hebron) includes the burial places of Adam and Eve,Abraham and Sarah, and Isaac and Rebecca. The graves of some of the greatestTalmudic personalities, including Rabbi Akiva and Nachman Ish Gamzu as well asthe great medieval philosopher Maimonides, are frequently visited by touristsand the many individuals who know of the tradition to visit the graves of thegreat sages.HOLY GRAVESITES IN EUROPESome of the most illustrious personalities who devoted their lives to learningand teaching Kabbalah were buried in Eastern Europe, and their gravesites havebeen established as pilgrimage places over the generations.A custom of writing out prayer requests and reading them aloud at thesegravesites has developed over time. Some pilgrims then tear the paper tosymbolize the prayer being delivered, and they leave the scraps of paper infront of the grave. While in Hungary, I visited the grave of one of the greatKabbalists, known as the Kallover Rebbe. When I arrived at his grave, I found alarge number of scraps of paper on the ground, indicating that, even in recentdays, pilgrims came to pour their hearts out in prayer at the grave of thisgreat Kabbalist.The Baal Shem Tov (Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer), the founder of Hasidism, whichspread the fundamental ideas of Kabbalah to the masses, was buried in the lasttown in which he lived, Medzhibus, in the Ukraine. His clearly marked graveremains there, and to this day, thousands of people devoted to the Kabbalisticteachings of the Baal Shem Tov visit his grave each year.Another great Kabbalistic personality, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, is buried inEastern Europe. Shortly before he died in 1810, Rabbi Nachman arrived in thetown of Uman, Ukraine, and his grave there remains a shrine and is regularlyvisited by his followers and admirers.There are many other grave sites of illustrious rabbis in Eastern Europe aswell.A HOLY GRAVESITE IN THE UNITED STATESMontefiore Cemetery in Queens, New York, is the final resting place of two greatcontemporary Kabbalists, Rabbi Joseph Isaac Schneerson and Rabbi Menachem MendelSchneerson. Rabbi Joseph Isaac Schneerson was the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, andafter his death, the new Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, frequentlyvisited his father-in-law’s gravesite with his prayers and the prayers ofthousands of others.When the seventh Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson died, he was laid to restbeside his father-in-law. Each year thousands of people visit the graves of bothrabbis and pour out their hearts in prayer.A well-known custom at the Western Wall in Jerusalem is writing a prayer to God,folding it up, and sticking it into one of the cracks in the wall. These notesare known as kvitlach (kvit-lakh). In a similar manner, when visiting the graveof the last two Lubavitcher Rebbes, it’s customary to write kvitlach and readthem before the graves. These pieces of paper usually contain heartfelt prayersand requests to these great holy men asking them to join in support of theprayers.Today, a visitation center built adjacent to the graves of these two greatKabbalists is open 24 hours a day, and it isn’t unusual to find people at thegraves of these great Kabbalists at all hours of the day and night.THE MIKVAHA mikvah (mihk -vah) is a natural body of water or a gathering of water that’sconnected to a source of natural water. A mikvah contains about 200 gallons ofwater and is uniquely designed for immersion. Jewish and Kabbalistic traditionidentifies water as the source of all living things, so a mikvah has to befilled with living waters, which means that it has to flow from a source that’snever dormant. A mikvah can be filled with rainwater, fresh spring water, ormelted snow.In traditional Jewish life, a married woman uses a mikvah in conjunction withher monthly menstrual cycle. However, in the world of Kabbalah and specificallyin the Hasidic world today, men as well as women use mikvahs. Some Hasidic menvisit the mikvah and immerse themselves in its waters every Friday afternoonbefore the arrival of Shabbat, but others are known to visit the mikvah everyday, 363 days a year (the days of Tisha B’Av and Yom Kippur are exempted; seeChapter 11).Remember [Images/Remember.jpg]Entering the mikvah and submerging one’s naked self in the water brings about asymbolic purification. A mikvah isn’t used for physical cleansing; there’s nosoap, no scrubbing, and no concern for cleanliness. Rather, submerging oneselfin the waters of the mikvah is a symbolic act of immersing in the waters andemerging as in Genesis to take in the breath of God.When I visited the city of Tzfat (see the entry earlier in this chapter), one ofthe places pointed out to me was the mikvah of the Ari, Rabbi Isaac Luria.According to tradition, this natural gathering of waters in a cave in the hillsof Tzfat is the very mikvah used by the great Kabbalists centuries ago. Likecountless people before me, I recited my prayers, prepared myself spirituallyand physically, and submerged myself in the icy waters of the mikvah of the Ari.It was a particularly moving experience becausebullet [Images/check.png] I truly felt a sense of continuity from one generationto another, tracing back centuries to the Ari himself. So many Kabbalists andstudents of Jewish tradition have taken those same steps and entered the sameliving waters.bullet [Images/check.png] By stripping down and fully submerging myself in theliving waters, I truly felt a sense of purification, and that, of course, isprecisely what the mikvah is about.Most cities in the United States with significant Jewish communities maintain atleast one mikvah, but these are usually reserved for women who use them inconjunction with their monthly cycles. The mikvahs are also used duringconversion ceremonies, when a convert to Judaism is required to enter the mikvahand be submerged to symbolize rebirthing one’s earthly spiritual identity.Cities and neighborhoods with traditional Hasidic communities usually havemikvahs especially dedicated to use by men who wish to continue thecenturies-old tradition. To use a mikvah today, it’s best to contact your localJewish Federation or Jewish Family Service, who maintain lists of Jewishprograms and resources made available across the denominations andneighborhoods.THE SYNAGOGUEA synagogue is obviously a Jewish house of worship, and certainly not allsynagogues focus on Kabbalistic tradition. Nevertheless, serious students ofKabbalah have a close connection to the synagogue for a number of reasons.bullet [Images/check.png] To participate in a complete prayer service, it’snecessary to pray with nine other people. (In Orthodox circles, the ten peoplemust be men over the age of 13, whereas in liberal Jewish communities, women arealso counted in the minyan [min-yahn; quorum].) For example, the mourner’sprayer, known as Mourner’s Kaddish, must be said in the presence of a minyan. Inaddition, the Kedusha (keh-doo-shah), a particularly sacred part of a dailysynagogue service, is recited when a minyan of ten is present.bullet [Images/check.png] In the synagogue on Shabbat, the sacred Torah scrollis taken out of its station, known as the aron hakodesh (ah-rone hah-koe-desh;holy ark), and read publicly to the congregation. This custom that Kabbalistshave participated in for many centuries is a moving and heart-stirring ritualand one that requires a minyan of ten, according to Jewish law.bullet [Images/check.png] Tradition teaches that the Shechina (sheh-khee-nah;presence of God) dwells intimately among a minyan of ten or more who gathertogether in a synagogue.THE BEDROOMAfter reading about some of the sacred places in the world of interest to aKabbalist, you may be thinking it odd to list the bedroom as one of the tenplaces that Kabbalist’s visit. But by “bedroom,” what I really mean is themarital bedroom.Kabbalistic literature abounds with erotic metaphors, so much so that a numberof studies have been written on the subject. Each points out that the greatKabbalists, when writing about the profound ideas of Kabbalistic tradition,often resort to erotic language. Remember that even the Kabbalist’s weeklySabbath observance is described as a wedding wherein Kabbalists greet theSabbath bride.When a husband and wife who are Kabbalists make love, Kabbalistic traditionteaches that their minds and inner intention should be directed toward heaven.The union of male and female isn’t just a sexual act between two individuals; ina sense, Kabbalists see it as a symbolic act of cosmic proportions. According toKabbalists, sexuality is in no way dirty or sinful; rather, sex is an exaltedact that can have a profound impact on the human soul.When a husband and wife who follow Kabbalistic tradition enter the marriagechamber, they’re aware that sexuality, like all pleasures of life, is a divinegift from above, and therefore, great care and the highest respect is requiredto fulfill the encounter appropriately.HERE AND NOWPerhaps the most important place for Kabbalists is right here and right now. Ina sense, every moment of life has the potential for either sanctity(consciousness of the Creator who gives everything) or debasement (taking lifefor granted with an absence of consciousness). The Kabbalist’s goal is to bringan awareness and consciousness of God to every moment without exception. When aKabbalist wakes up in the morning, his or her first thoughts should be that ofgratitude to God. And that consciousness should continue throughout the day,until the very last moment before sleep.Every moment of every day also brings the opportunity for sensitivity to others(or lack of sensitivity). Kabbalistic tradition urges a heightened sense ofmorality and ethics at all times. The here and now offers abundant opportunitiesfor acts of lovingkindness and efforts to repair the world.Unlike some religious traditions that set aside certain times and days assacred, Kabbalists consider every moment sacred. The observance of many holydays on the Jewish calendar doesn’t contradict the basic and fundamental viewthat all life comes from the Divine and that God creates the world in everymoment. Kabbalists don’t put off religion and spirituality for some other timeor place; they know that every moment is meant to be seized, that every momenthas great spiritual potential, and that every moment is a gift from above."},{"pageContent":"PART VIAPPENDIXES[Images/915904 fgCN06.jpg]In this part . . .Appendix A is a list of resources that I think you’ll appreciate and enjoy.Appendix B is a handy list of the important characters in the Torah to help youremember who’s who.

Given the quantity and quality of available literature, I imagine thatyou wouldn’t mind some recommendations of some books to read as you increaseyour interest and understanding of Kabbalah. This appendix contains my bestsuggestions in no particular order.THE BOOKS OF RABBI ARYEH KAPLANElsewhere in this book I recommend Rabbi Kaplan’s translation of the Five Booksof Moses called The Living Torah. Rabbi Kaplan wrote many other noteworthy booksin his relatively short career that you’d be well-served to read. Among them aresome of the most important and revealing books on Kabbalah in English, includingMeditation and Kabbalah and Jewish Meditation: A Practical Guide. I also suggesttracking down anything else written by the late Rabbi Kaplan — you really can’tgo wrong with his work.THE THIRTEEN PETALLED ROSE BY RABBI ADIN STEINSALTZRabbi Adin Steinsaltz’s The Thirteen Petalled Rose isn’t a book about Kabbalah —it’s a book of Kabbalah. The brief, 180-page volume has become a contemporaryclassic, piercing to the heart of the most profound ideas in Jewish theology.It’s essential reading for any serious student of Kabbalah today.Like The Thirteen Petalled Rose, all the books written by the incomparable RabbiSteinsaltz are profound. In particular, you shouldn’t miss Simple Words, a slimbook about some of the most familiar words in our lives; the volume containsimportant spiritual principles that you can use every day.THE WAY OF SPLENDOR: JEWISH MYSTICISM AND MODERN PSYCHOLOGY BY EDWARD HOFFMANHoffman’s The Way of Splendor: Jewish Mysticism and Modern Psychology is awonderful introduction to Kabbalah through the eyes of a psychologist. Dr.Hoffman is a master at taking profound Kabbalistic ideas and reframing them infamiliar and easy-to-grasp terms. He writes with great clarity and insight.THE BOOKS OF RABBI ZALMAN SCHACHTER-SHALOMIKnown to his many students and admirers as Reb Zalman, Rabbi ZalmanSchachter-Shalomi is the founder of the Jewish Renewal movement, which is markedby a deep interest and spiritual connection to Kabbalistic traditions. Two booksin particular are essential reading to get into the creative mind of Reb Zalman:bullet [Images/check.png] Paradigm Shift: From the Jewish Renewal Teachings ofReb Zalman Schachter-Shalomi by Ellen Singer, which contains his essentialteachingsbullet [Images/check.png] Wrapped in a Holy Flame: Teachings and Tales of theHasidic Masters, in which Reb Zalman doesn’t just discuss the great Hasidicmasters of Kabbalah — he almost becomes them as he writes!SOULS ON FIRE BY ELIE WIESELIn his youth, Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel studied Kabbalah. After hisexperiences during the Holocaust, he continued his lifelong study of Jewishtradition, as his exceptional books reflect. Of Wiesel’s many extraordinaryvolumes, Souls on Fire is one of his masterpieces. In it he shares his passionfor the lives and wisdom of the great Hasidic sages.9 1/2 MYSTICS: THE KABBALA TODAY BY RABBI HERBERT WEINEROver 30 years ago, Rabbi Herbert Weiner, a modern congregational rabbi in NewJersey, went searching the world for teachers who could provide him with anunderstanding of Kabbalah. He met many contemporary teachers of Kabbalah, and in9 1/2 Mystics, he shares his journeys and encounters with readers. This bookremains fresh, beautifully written, and deceptively deep so many years later.KABBALAH: SELECTIONS FROM CLASSIC KABBALISTIC WORKS BY RABBI AVRAHAM YAAKOVFINKELThis book is the best single-volume introduction to the great personalities ofKabbalah throughout history. Like several of Rabbi Finkel’s other superb books(such as The Great Torah Commentators, The Great Chasidic Masters, andContemporary Sages ), Selections from Classic Kabbalistic Works introducesreaders to biographical information about each personality and presentscarefully selected words of wisdom and teachings from their writings.THE ARTSCROLL PRAYER BOOKEvery Jewish household and everyone interested in Judaism and Kabbalah needs anArtscroll Prayer Book. (When you pick up your copy, make sure it’s NusachSefard, which means that it reflects Kabbalistic practice today.) This onevolume contains every prayer and blessing referred to in Kabbalah For Dummies.It also offers a huge amount of information on the meanings of the prayers aswell as instructions for participating in traditional rituals and celebrations.Also included are the Jewish wedding ceremony and many other prayers for lifecycle events.MISHNEH TORAH: YESODEI HATORAH BY THE RAMBAMThe great Jewish philosopher and sage Maimonides (also known as the Rambam)wrote many books. One of his most celebrated and revered works is the 14-volumeMishneh Torah, a compilation representing the essence of the entire body ofJewish teachings. Many sections of this huge work have been translated. Irecommend the translation of the volume Yesodei HaTorah (The Foundation of theTorah) because it offers the very first chapters of the entire work. Known as“The laws which are the Foundations of the Torah,” chapters one and two revealthe fundamentals of Kabbalah. Although Maimonides isn’t known as a Kabbalist,his work is a beautiful illustration of how the same profound ideas of Jewishtheology can be expressed in entirely different ways.THE FUNDAMENTALS OF JEWISH MYSTICISM BY RABBI LEONARD GLOTZERThe introduction to this book is one of the best explanations of the ten sefirotI’ve ever seen. The book itself follows the commentary of the Vilna Gaon as thatgreat sage looked at one of the classics of Kabbalah, Sefer Yetzirah."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX BPATRIARCHS, SWINDLERS, PROPHETS, AND SINNERS: MEET 100 TORAH CHARACTERSInvolving oneself in Torah study, including the commentaries (and commentarieson commentaries), is such an integral part of a Kabbalist’s life that thecharacters actually live among the student, guiding the way and teachingprofound principles of the universe.
