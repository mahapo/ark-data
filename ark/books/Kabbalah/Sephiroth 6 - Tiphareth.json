It is the Sun which all the planets revolved around. It is the Buddha, Krishna M ohammed, Christ Child within us all. With Tiphareth we all have the power to heal ourselves. Tiphareth is the love we have for ourselves, not the passionate love of Geburah ( Mars ) nor the romantic love of Netzach ( Venus )it is the self love we have for own God within us. It is our Faith. It is our own understand ing of ourselves and such is the centre of our universe, as the Sun is the centre of Astrological universe. The Fact that Geburah ( Mars ) and Netzach ( Venus ) are separated by Tiphareth is a wonderful thing. Here we have both the constructive and destructive elements of love bound by the love of self. The extreme passion of Geburah and the soft vulnerability of Netzach are tempered by a h ealing understanding of Tiphareth . Wonderful isn't it ! This Sephiroth also represents the earthly existence of the Messiah. It is the Christ, the Buddha, The Krishna and the Mohammed in all of us. As is said \"The face of the Father is seen reflect ed in the Son through the spirit of the Holy Ghost\" . You can plot this on the \"Tree of Life\" by using the Father as Kether , the Holy Ghost as Yesod and of course the Son as Tiphareth . This Sephiroth also separates Hod and Chesed . They are the forces of Knowledge and Intelligence. The energies of Mercury and Jupiter. Here again the need for Chesed ( Jupiter ) to build, make the law and organize are tempered against Hod ( Mercury ) in it's need to understand and explore and create. Again it's the love of Tiphareth that holds all of this in balance. One final aspect of Tiphareth ( and there are really many more ) is the centering in the Great Wheel in the \"Tree of Life\". This wheel has six points. The 5 Sephiroth that directly touch it, not counting the 3 in the Supernal Triangle and 1 hidden between Binah and Chokmah . This hidden Sephiroth is called Daath and is not drawn on the \"Tree of Life\" and exists outside of the dimension of the other 10 Sephiroths. This wheel when j oined is the symbol of \"The Star of David\". It has the triangle above of Daath-Hod- Netzach and the triangle below of Geburah- Yesod-Chesed. Draw th e 2 triangles and you will find the universal symbols of above and below combined into the \"Star of David\".
