GREENE,In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.Beaten:Stereetyfed end Printed by Rend, Avery, 6* Cm.Picture #3 [images/img_0003.png]THE BLAZING- STAR.Some men — not all men — see always before them an ideal, a mental picture ifyou will, of what they ought to be, and are not. Whoso seeks to follow thisideal revealed to the mental vision, whoso seeks to attain to conformity withit, will find it enlarge itself, and remove from him. He that follows it willimprove his own moral character ; but the ideal will remain always above him andbefore him, prompting him to new exertions. What is the natural conscience if itbe not a condemnation of ourselves as we are, mean, pitiful, weak, and acomparison of ourselves with what we ought to be, wise, powerful, holy ?It is this Ideal of what wc ought to be, and are not, that is symbolicallypictured in the Blazing Star.The abject slave on an East-African rice plantation, brutal, ignorant, and adevil-worshipper, sees this Day-Star rising in his heart, and straightway hebecomes intellectually of age. For it is the soul, not the body, that attains tothe age' of discretion. They who see this Star, have attained to their majority:all other persons are minors. Before the rays of thisStar, voudouism and devil-worship, whether in refined8Picture #4 [images/img_0004.png]4societies, or among barbarous peoples, vanish into night; for immersion into therays of this Star, is the beginning of the baptism of repentance and penance forthe remission of sin — and of the penalties of sin. *****Whoso beholds this Star acquires faith. Faith is conviction born from theconsciousness of aspiration. Faith is the active principle of intellectualprogress.The Blazing Star is the transfigured image of man — the Ideal that removesfarther and farther, making always higher and higher claims, until, at the last,it becomes lost in infinity; and faith affirms that this same Blazing Star maybe, perhaps, the shadowy, imperfect, and inadequate image of some unknown andinvisible God.Now, if it be true that God and man are in one image dr likeness (and theaffirmation that they are so is not unplausible) then it is the duty of man tobring out into its full splendor that Divine Image which is latent, on one side,in the complexity of his own nature. This conclusion confirms itself.You say you will never believe in God until the fact of his existence is provedto you! Then you will never believe in him at all; for, in the face of positiveknowledge, faith is no longer possible. Faith affirms in the presence of theunknown. If science should ever demonstrate the existence of God (which it nevercan) faith would become lost in sight, and men would no longer believe, butknow. The reason why science is intrinsically incompetent to either prove ordisprove the existence of God, is simply this, that the subject-mattertranscends the reach of scienPicture #5 [images/img_0005.png]5tific instruments and processes. The dispute is, therefore, not between faithand science, but between faith and unbelief. Unbelief is a disease, not of thehuman understanding, but of the human will, and is susceptible of cure.Saint Paul says,44 We walk by faith, and not by sight;” again, 44 We see througha glass darkly;” and again, 44 We are saved by hope, but hope that is seen isnot hope.” Do what we will, we are under the necessity of walking, much morethan half our time, not by sight, but by faith. The better half of our life uponthe earth, and the happier half, is the part that is spent in advance ofpositive knowledge.Science is constantly encroaching on the domains of faith, by showing thatpostulates of faith are demonstrably correct. But whenever any postulate offaith is proved, and thus becomes a truth of science, and no longer a truth offaith, faith immediately passes again to the front, with the affirmation of anew, and a higher, postulate. Faith keeps always well in advance of science.Legitimate science never arrays itself in a hostile attitude against genuinefaith. Science, it is true, often successfully refutes dogmas that are allegedto be of faith ; but, in such cases, it is always found, upon due observationand inquiry, that the dogmas so refuted were born, not at all of faith, but ofpolitical or clerical ambition, or of fear, or of self-interest, or of thepresumption of ignorance, or of some other human passion, — or, perhaps, ofsheer stupidity. Superstition, fanaticism and bigotry are signs andi*Picture #6 [images/img_0006.png]6marks showing that the soul is not yet intellectually of age. They never resultfrom convictions born of the consciousness of aspiration, and are, therefore,never of faith.Faith does not say, Is there a God ? It is doubt that says that. Faith says, Whyshould there not be a God ? Absolute perfection is no natural obstacle toexistence, but the contrary. Faith says, Figure to yourself, if you can, thatthere is no God ! You cannot do it.Faith is the affirmation respecting things unknown, that is implied in thepractical recognition of known absurdity as such. Faith is reason denyingabsurdity in the face of the unknown.An admissible definition of God must be in the form of a negative pregnant—anaffirmation of God as that unknown Absolute and Infinite, which is the reason ofthe existence of the known finite and relative that we ourselves are.Faith is from within ; it is the outbreaking of human spontaneity; it is forceof soul, grandeur of sentiment, magnanimity, generosityi courage. Its formulasare naturally unintelligible in their literal tenor; for, otherwise, they wouldrepresent that which is scientifically known, and would not be the mereprovisional clothing of that which is not objectively given, but subjectively *projected from the inmost depth of the soul. Man, having an ideal before him ofthat which he ought to be, and is not, and act* That is subject which calls itself Ego, /. That is object which the /contradistinguishes from itself, calling it non-Ego. That is subjective whichbelongs to the subject; and that objective which belougs to the object.Picture #7 [images/img_0007.png]7mg as though he possessed the character he ought to have, but has not, oomes, bythe very virtue of his aspiration, to possess the character he imagines. Thusthe world is leavened. Materialism, the spiritual death which is consequent uponthe subordination of the subject to the object in thought, is the very soil fromwhich faith springs; for every thing that stands by itself alone, makes way,through the necessity of the principle of contradictions, for its correlativeopposite. Stoicism has always its birth in Sybaritic cities, and amongover-civilized and effete peoples. Men learn, through faith, to do always thevery thing they are afraid to do, and thus come to fear no longer. Unbeliefnaturally gives emptiness of heart; and emptiness of heart surprises itBelf withspontaneity of worship; and spontaneous worship gives the worshipper somethingof the high nature of that which is worshipped ; and, in this way, unbelieftransfigures itself, and loses itself in faith. Faith may always be acquired.Whoso is devoid of faith, and desires to have it, may acquire it by living for afew days (sometimes for a few hours only) as though he already possessed it. Itis by practical, not theoretical, religion, that men transform their lives. Bythe practice of faith, man grows strong in faith. The moral coward becomes amoral hero as soon as he acquires faith. Weak women, among the early martyrs,learned by faith to face the wild beasts. When they were thrown to the lions,the lions trembled; for the women were more lion-like than the lions, and thelions knew it.* * « * *Man has a threefold nature. He is, therefore, symPicture #8 [images/img_0008.png]8bolically represented under the similitude of a triangle. Saint Paul says thatman is body, soul, and spirit; and Saint Augustin says that he is will,understanding, memory. One philosopher says that man is intelligence, activity,and sensibility; another says that he is sensation, sentiment, cognition; andother philosophers give other formulas. But there exists no extant denial (atthe least, none such exists to our knowledge) of the essential triplicity ofman’s nature.* * * * *The Ideal is the invisible Sun which is always on the meridian of the soul. Asthe ever-revolving earth rises and sets upon the sun, which is steadfast, andnot the sun on the earth, so the soul rises or sets on the Ideal; which is whatit is whether man behold it or not, and is itself unaffected by man’s attitudein respect to it, since it is the fixed centre, and the Day-Star of spiritualexistences. It was for this reason that the temples were always opened in theancient times, for purposes of initiation, at what was mystically called “ highnoon,” although, in point of practical fact, that same 44 high noon ” oftenoccurred at the dead of night. This Day-Star was known in the temples asBel-samen, the Lord of Heaven, —as Mithras also, or as Osiris, or Apollo, or,more mystically, as Abrasax, and by a thousand other names. In the publicworship, it was recognized as the visible sun; but in the esoteric work, afterthe avenues of the temples were duly guarded against cowans and eavesdroppers,as the Ideal-Man, and as the Star of souls.* * * * *Picture #9 [images/img_0009.png]9The five-rayed Blazing Star — the Pentacle — Abrak— is the special star of thegreat Aryan (or Indo-Germanic, or Japhetic*) race. [The Shemite knows it not.]This Star — Abrak—is a disguised image or likeness of man. The superior rayrepresents the head; the horizontal rays, the two arms; and the inferior rays,the two legs. This Star, being unsymmetrical, is capable of being turned upsidedown. It is our intention to explain, at some future time, the terrible meaningthat is presented by the five-rayed Star, when its point is turned downward. Letit suffice to say, here, in passing, that this detestable sign (the invertedStar) execrated by the more intelligent adepts themselves in pervertedmysteries, and excluded from their midnight orgies, is the head of the famousgoat that plays so important a part in the ceremony of obscene initiations. Thetwo ascending rays are the goat’s horns, the horizontal rays are his two ears,and the descending ray is his beard, f ****** “These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man, and perfect in hisgenerations, and Noah walked with the Elohim. And Noah begat three sons, Shew,Ham, and Japhet”—Oen. vi. 9-10.f The human hand, with the thnmb and fingers, is the fire-rayed Star; but withthe three larger fingers dosed, and the thnmb and little finger protruding (theeommon counter-charm to the eril-eye) it is that Star inverted, or the goat’shead. The hand with the three larger fingers dosed, is the negation of theternary, and the affirmation of the antagonistic natural forces only. The thumbrepresents generative power, and the little finger denotes insinuating tact: thehand, therefore, that shows the thumb and little finger only, denotes passionunited with address. The thumb is the synthesis of the whole hand. A morallystrong man has always a strong thumb; and a weak man, a weak thumb. A long thumbdenotes obstinacy. Blessings are oonfferred with two of the larger fingers, orwith all three of them. The thumb and little finger are used In cursing.Picture #10 [images/img_0010.png]Picture #11 [images/img_0011.png]Picture #12 [images/img_0012.png]10The Shemitic race, the equal of the Aryan, and in some respects its superior,knows not Abrak : it sees not that inner light which the Aryan sees, and ofwhich we have all along been speaking. But, instead, the Shemite hears inwardly— as the Aryan does not — mysterious and unspeakable words which it is notlawful for a man to utter. To the Shemite, conscience is not at all acomparison, as it is to the Aryan, of what man makes real in himself, with theideal always before him of what he ought to so make real, but is, on thecontrary, the actual voice of God speaking inwardly to the soul. The Aryanobjectives all things. He forms conceptions tangible to the imagination; andwhat he is incompetent to clearly conceive, he discards as unreal. He naturallygives form and expression, through symbolic art, to his inward thought; and,until his thought is expressed in forip, it is, to him, as though it existednot. To the Shemite, on the contrary, all visible symbols, whether discernibleto the outward or to the inward eye, are worse than worthless. The poetry of theAryans is objective and descriptive; that of the Shemites is sometimes didactic,sometimes lyrical, but never objective. The Shemite has no plastic and nopictorial art. The religion of the Aryan is that of the revealed Ideal; thereligion of the Shemite is that of the revealed Word. The conscience is theessential religious faculty of man; and it is in the' divergent natures of theAryan and Shemitic consciences, that the root of the divergencies of the Aryanand Shemitic religions is to be sought and found. The soirit of the Shemite conPicture #13 [images/img_0013.png]11tinually groans and travails within itself, waiting for the utterance ofunspoken words; and it revels in the consciousness of that which it knows to beat once real and inconceivable. When the great wind rent the mountains, andbroke the rocks in pieces before Elijah (a Hebrew Shemite) the prophet could notsee God in the wind. Neither could he see God in the earthquake that followedthe wind, or in the fire that followed the earthquake. But, after the fire,there came 44 a still small voice; ” and, when Elijah heard that, he wrapped hisface in his mantle, and went to the mouth of the cave, and stood up beforeJehovah. It was the “word” of the Lord that came to the greater Hebrew prophets;and it was only by prophets of lesser note that44 visions ” were seen in deepsleep, when they were upon their beds. The greater prophets heard in ecstatictrances; but they seldom saw clairvoyantly. It would seem that God is nearer tothe Shemite than he is to the Aryan. When the Aryan, bewildered in hisreasonings, turns round and says, “ There is no God I ” the Shemite, hearinghim, answers, 44 God exists. I know him personally. I have talked with him, andhe has talked with me.” And the Shemitic affirmation of faith has always carriedthe day against the Aryan suggestion of doubt. For whenever, in the great marchof mankind — humanity — the collective Adam*—from the mystical Eastern gate ofEden,* Saint Paul, that great Kabballst, shows clearly (Homans v. 12-10, and 1Corinthians xiv. 22), that by the word “ Adam ” is to be understood the originalCollective Man. The Collective Mon may very well have once existed in a singleperson, or, rather, in a single eouple; and, in fact, tradition informs yu thatit has twioe so existed, — once in Adam and Eve, and once in Noah and his wiffc.IPicture #14 [images/img_0014.png]12an Aryan religion has come in contact with a Shemitic religion, the Aryanreligion has at once gone to the wall, waned pale, wilted, and subsided.* * * * *In the year 606 B. C., Nebuchadnezzar, the Shemitic King of Shemitic-HamiticBabylon, utterly and definitively defeated Joachim, the Shemitic king ofShemitic Jerusalem, and transplanted the mass of the Jewish people, as captives,to the neighborhood of Babylon.During their captivity, the chiefs of the Jews, already initiated into theprofound mysteries of the Hebrew religion, were further initiated into theoccult science of the Chaldeans, — a science of Hamitic origin, akin to that ofTyre and Sidon, and to that which had its mysterious colleges on Mount Gebal.About seventy years after the fall of Jerusalem, Cyrus, king of the Turanian andAryan Medes, and of the Aryan Persians, having first turned the Euphrates aside,took Babylon by storm, on the night of a drunken and frantic Chaldean festival.He entered the city by the way of the empty river-bed, bringing with him, asofficial chaplains of his army, the more illustrious of the Median Magi, and theAryan chiefpriests of Orraudz.The captive Jews, who had been all along conspirators in Babylon, and secretallies of the Persians, furnished guides, spies and scouts to the invading Aryanarmjr. After the taking of the city, Cyrus rewarded the Jews with his personalfriendship, and sent them back to their own country, with instructions torebuild Jerusalem; which latter city rePicture #15 [images/img_0015.png]18mained, after its restoration, for several generations, as much from gratitudeas policy, a Persian stronghold.At the solemn conferences that took place in the East of Babylon, near the greatTower, at the time of the Persian conquest, between the Median Magi, theChaldean soothsayers, the Aryan priests of Ormudz, and the Hebrew Prophets, thefacts were clearly verified, that, on one side, man aspires towards God, and, onthe other, that the Supreme condescends to. take up his abode, and to utter hisoracles, in the ‘ secret temple of the human heart. These facts had, it is true,been well known for centuries to the generality of simple and pious men andwomen in private station, and also to prophets * and inspired poets; but theyhad never before been so verified to the conviction of kings and statesmen, inthe presence of concurring and confessing sacerdotal corporations.At these conferences, the three constituent elements of the universalconsciousness of the collective Adam, were severally and respectivelyrepresented. The Aryan priests of Ormudz maintained the claims of the object inthought. The Hamitic-Chaldean soothsayers (Hamitic Egypt had no delegate at thesynod) maintained the claims of the human subject. And the Hebrew Prophets fromthe Holy Land maintained the claims of the relation which subsists between the* “ This commandment which I command thee tbia day, it la not hidden from thee,neither is it fia off. It ta not in heaven, that thou ahouldeat say, Who shallgo vp for os to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it. and do U.Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say. Who shall go over the seafbr us. and bring it unto ns, that we may hear it, and do it. But the word isvery nigh unto thee, in thy mouth,, and in thy heart, that thon mayest doit.”—neat. xxx. 11-14.2Picture #16 [images/img_0016.png]14subject and the object in thought. For, where the Aryan sees inwardly, andaffirms the reality of the object, and the Shemite hears inwardly, and affirmsthe reality of the relation between the subject and the object, the Hamite feelsinwardly, but very darkly, and affirms the reality of the human subject.*In these conferences were also verified the foundations of that sublime anduniversal science, which, six centuries afterwards, was published among adepts,as the Holy Kabbala, and which had been known, but fragmentarily only, and inits essential principles, long before, to men of the stamp of Abraham,Zoroaster, Moses, Solomon king of Jerusalem, and Hiram king of Tyre.The Orient of Babylon was not intellectually competent to co-ordinate theprinciples of the Kabbala, and to. present the completed synthetic doctrine in adefinitive form. There was a necessity that the materials should remainunsystematized until the human intellect could have an opportunity to becomesharpened by the practice of Greek metaphysical dialectics. Many Greek wordsoccur in the Zohar, or Book of Splendor; and it is difficult to believe thatcertain essential passages of the lira Suta (the third tract in the collectionof the lesser Zohar') could have been written by any one unacquainted withAristotle’s treatise of Metaphysics-! Careful investigators have* Of course) the synod took no cognizance of the metaphysical distinction of thesubject) the object, and the relation, in thought, under its modern abstractform. What we now call the object, was then darkly cognized as the Japheticcharacteristic, tendency, and inspiring natural principle; what we call thesubject, as the Ham* tic characteristic, tendency, and Inspiring naturalprinciple; and what we call the relation, as the Shemitic, &c.f “ The thought which is most, is thought concerning that which is most:Picture #17 [images/img_0017.png]15decided, from what they regard as internal evidence, that the definitivecompilation of the Kabbala dates from some period between the year 200 B.C. andthe year 150 of the Christian era. It is the internal form of the Kabbala,however, its substance only, that is systematic: its exposition in words hasbeen left, apparently with deliberate intention, in an exceedingly chaoticstate. To the majority of readers, the Kabbala is, as it ought to be, completelyunintelligible.* * * * *At an unknown and remote epoch, it was affirmed, probably by some Hamite, as apostulate of faith, that God and man are in the same likeness or image. It wasalso affirmed, as a logical consequence of this fundamental affirmation, (1)that, since man is triune, the Supreme is also triune, and (2) that, since manmay be denoted by an ascending triangle, the Supreme may be denoted by adescending triangle. The figure in the margin is not at all idolatrous ; for itis not, as Abrak is, a disguised image or likeness. It is a reminder only, — asign or symbol,— not a resemblance. It is a pictorial word, suggesting athought, — such as were in common and necessary use before the alphabet wasinvented.It was also affirmed, perhaps at the same unknown epoch, that the interlacing ofthe Divine trianglePicture #18 [images/img_0018.png]and mind knows itself through the perception of that which is intelligible; andmind becomes intelligible to itself through reflection and thought: so thatIntelligence itself becomes intelligible. . . . Thus God possesses in perfectionwhat we possess for a time only. He possesses more than we hare stated; for hepossesses, in addition, life. The action of intelligence is life; and God isthat action.”—Aristotle's Metaphysics, Book xii.Picture #19 [images/img_0019.png]16with the human triangle, in the six-rayed BlazingOStar, is the authentic symbol of the revelation of God to man, and of the abodeof the Supreme in the human heart, as well as of the aspiration of man towardsGod. Jacob Behmen asserts that the junction of these two triangles is the mostsignificant and mystical figure in nature. The reality denoted by this symbol isneither God nor man: it is distinct from man, before him, and above him, as thehuman Ideal; and it is apart from God, as one of the Revelations of Himself thatthe Supreme sees fit to make to man, — as one of the names of Him who, in hisown essence, isNAMELESS.Sometimes the six-rayed Blazing Star is portrayed as a mystic Rose with sixleaves. But the ordinary form is that of the two interlacing triangles, with thePicture #20 [images/img_0020.png]Divine name inscribed in the middle of the figure. The interlacing triangles areoften indicated by a junction of the square and compasses: to which, somePicture #21 [images/img_0021.png]times, the plumb and the level are added, forming a cross in the centre, andgiving a ten-rayed Star, with four of the rays (those formed by the extremitiesof theplumb and level) occulted. This is the prophetic Star; and the ten rays standfor the ten Kabbalistic Sephiroth. Without a preliminary understanding of theten Sephiroth, the Kabbala, as a Philosophy of History, and consequently as aPractical Art for the forecasting of future events, cannot be appreciated.Picture #22 [images/img_0022.png]17We will do our best at some future time, if oc asion offers, to explain theseten rays, ray by ray, from the Kabbalistic point of view.* * * * *The ordinary, every-day man or woman, that is to ' say, the man or woman who hasnot yet reached perfection, — and who is there that has reached perfection ?—may be symbolically represented, if he or she be morally of age, by anequilateral triangle with one angle pointing upward to the Blazing Star. Whosorecognizes the virtue of that Star, at once acknowledges the Divine Law in itsthreefold applications, and strives after conformity with the Ideal, notaccording to the spirit only, but also according to the soul and the body.Man’s duty to himself and to his fellow-man, under the rays of the Blazing Star,is threefold: (1) the achievement of his own Liberty; (2) the definitiveestablishment of relations of Equality between himself and other jnen ; and (3)the fusion of himself, in the solidarity of Brotherhood, with all human beingswho, like himself, recognize the Blazing Star.Liberty is the power which every human being ought to possess of actingaccording to the dictates of his own private conscience, under the rays of thatBlazing Star which is seen by him, secretly, from the centre of his individualheart.Equality is the condition that obtains in every society where no special orartificial privilege is granted to any one, or to any set, of its members.Brotherhood is that strict solidarity between themembers of a social body, which causes, under the 2*Picture #23 [images/img_0023.png]18rays of the Blazing Star, the welfare of each to be seen as involved in that ofevery other, and of all, and that of all in that of each.Liberty is the right of each member against every other member, and against allthe members. Equality is the right of every other member, and of all themembers, against each member. Liberty and Equality find their harmony in thesynthetic principle of Fraternity. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: this is themystical triangle that ought to be inscribed on the banners of everytruly-constituted social organism.Liberty alone may lead to anarchy, or to the tyranny of individuals over themass; but the dangers from Liberty vanish in the presence of Equality. Equalityalone may lead to the tyranny of the general mass over individuals or overminorities; but the dangers from Equality vanish in the presence of Liberty.Fraternity is never alone; for it is, in its essence, the synthesis of Libertyand Equality. *****What is it to be a Slave ? It is to have the inward knowledge of that which isgreat and holy, and to be constrained to do things that are small and base. Itis to be a person consciously capable of self-government, and to be, at the sametime, subject to the will of another person. It is to be a full-grown personwhose actual rights are those of a child only. It is to see the Blazing Star,and not be permitted to follow it.Slavery is a factitious and arbitrarily-imposed prolongation of the term ofmoral minority. PaternalPicture #24 [images/img_0024.png]19government, actual or constructive, is just and legitimate when exercised overpersons who are morally under age; but, to such as know the Blazing Star, it is,when exercised to the confiscation of their initiative, the most infernal of alltyrannies. Paternal government, exercised by the natural father over his ownminor children, is tempered by affection, and justifies itBelf; but paternalgovernment, exercised by usurpers over their natural equals and superiors, is anoppressive wrong, and the most intolerable of all outrages, — at the least, itis so in the estimation of such as have seen the Blazing Star.It is neither the experience of physical want and privation, nor the fact ofsubordination to legitimate authority, that makes a man to be a slave; forsaints and soldiers suffer hardships, and obey their superiors, and are notslaves. On the contrary, it is by the token of the conscious moral penury whicha soul feels when it finds itself helpless and hopeless under the domination ofan alien soul, — it is by the sentiment of a confiscated individuality, by theconsciousness of being annexed, as a base appendage, to another soul, — it is bythe consciousness of being sacrificed to a foreign personality, — it is by thedarkening of the moral firmament, and by the occultation of the Blazing Star,through the intervention of an extraneous usurping will,—that a man comes toknow that he is a slave. And it is, on the other hand, the insolent, lyinghypocrisy, the false professions of morality, the transparently - spuriousphilanthropy, the limitless and blinding arrogance of self-conceit, under whichthe usurper half-conoeals, half-reveals, his unnatural lustPicture #25 [images/img_0025.png]20to wipe out human souls, and to obliterate every individuality except his own, —that gives energy to slaves, and renders conspiracies, risings, strikes, andrevolutions, deadly and chronic.The fundamental right of a man is the right to be himself; and this right is hissovereignty. No man has a right to confiscate the sovereignty of any other man.No man can delegate to another man, or to society, any right which he does nothimself possess. A man may wickedly forfeit his sovereignty by the commission ofcrime; he may perversely turn his back upon the Blazing Star, and abdicate hisindividuality and his manhood. But no man can rightfully abdicate hissovereignty. It is the duty of every man of sane mind, who supports himself, andis not convicted of crime, to vindicate his essential dignity as rightfulsovereign of himself and of every thing that pertains to his individuality.Every able-bodied man has a natural right, and a natural duty, to forciblyrepel, and to combine with others to forcibly repel, any and all wrongfulinvasions of his sovereignty. Society exists for the individual, and not theindividual for society. Institutions are made for man, and not man forinstitutions.* * * * *The French Free Masons claim, in their Constitutions, that the formula Liberty,Equality, Fraternity, has been, from the beginning, the device of their order.The writer of these pages is, and has been for many years, a member of one ofthe Masonic Lodges (we are told there were a hundred and twenty of them)Picture #26 [images/img_0026.png]21that recently planted their banners, under the fire of the Versailles troops,upon the ramparts in front of Paris. He knows not by what authority thedemonstration was made. He supposes, however, that it was made by the authorityof the Paris Lodges only, and that the consent of the Grand Orient of France wasneither requested nor deemed necessary.It is easy, at this moment, to apply abusive epithets, either to the Commune orto its enemies. The Great Architect of the Universe will, at the proper time,judge both parties.The French word commune is the equivalent of our English word town. The wordcommuniste may denote, in French, either (1) an advocate of the doctrine thatwomen and property ought to be held in common, or (2) ah upholder of theprinciple of municipal self-government. The Commune of Paris fought, in itsrecent great fight, not for a community of women and goods, but for municipalself-government. It was well known, both at Paris and at Versailles, while thefighting was going on, that M. Thiers could have made peace with the insurgents,at any moment, by simply guaranteeing to the city of Paris an amount ofmunicipal liberty equal to that which has always been enjoyed by the city ofBoston. This fact, which cannot with any plausibility be denied, and whichprobably will not be denied, suffices, of itself alone, to put the merits of thedispute between the Commune of Paris and the Versailles government, in its truelight, and to fully expose the calumnious misrepresentations of the Versaillesparty.We are of the opinion, that, taking fighting as itPicture #27 [images/img_0027.png]22rises, the Commune made a passably good fight. We are especially proud of theheroic women with whom the honor of arms has definitively rested.We, nevertheless, take the liberty to recommend the Commune to be morecircumspect, hereafter, in the matter of summary executions. Better things wereexpected of the Commune than of the Versailles government; for the Communerepresents advancing civilization, while the Versailles government representsthe commercial, industrial, and financial feudalism of the present and the past.It will never do for men who have seen the Blazing Star, to follow evilexamples, and meet murder with murder. The execution of spies and traitors, andthe use of petroleum for incendiary purposes,* are perfectly justifiable underthe laws of war ; but the civilized world does not look with approval, and oughtnot to look with approval, upon the military execution of priests and othernon-combatants. We know (or, at the least, we have been informed) that theCommune offered to exchange the Archbishop of Paris for Blanqui, and that theoffer was not accepted. This fact (if it be a fact) consigns the memory of M.Thiers to the execration of posterity; but it does not excuse the Commune.The existing French Assembly was elected, not at all to govern France, but toconsult on the possibilities of a reconciliation between France and Prussia, andalso, if advisable, to conclude and authenticate a treaty of peace. The Assemblyhas, therefore, no* We should like to know whether the Union Army, acting under orders, did, ordid not, ever set fire to any thing in the valley or the Shenandoah; ana whethershells loaded with incendiary composition were, or were not, thrown fromourehips and batteries into the city of Charleston.Picture #28 [images/img_0028.png]28lawful governmental powers. When the treaty of peace between France and Prussiawas signed, the mandate of the Assembly expired. The government of M. Thiers isa government of usurpers. It has belligerent rights, and it has no other rights.Consequently, every disarmed prisoner of war, male or female, shot in cold bloodafter a combat, in pursuance of M. Thiers’s policy, whether sentenced or notsentenced by court-martial, is — from a legal point of view — simply a personassassinated. And the moral aspect of the question is coincident with the legalaspect. If the Communists committed excesses (and it seems they were human),they did so m defending themselves, their families, and their homes, againstthieves and usurpers. Thiers fought to confiscate the liberties and control themoney of the people of Paris; and Paris fought in defence of the natural rightsof its own people.Three times the heroic people of Paris have been cheated out of their Republic :once in the great revolution ; afterwards in 1830; and, again, in 1848. To-daythe scales are still oscillating, and the result is yet undetermined. In thenext great fight, or in the fight after the next, the Republic will prevail. TheBlazing Star as Paris sees it, now struggling with obscurantism and secularwrong, tinges the whole horizon of the East with the glories of the coming day.The Kabbalistic synthesis is nearer than it was!* * * * *The Shemitic principle and the Japhetic principle are to-day represented inhuman civilization, — the first by the Israelitish Church, and the second by thePicture #29 [images/img_0029.png]24Christian Church. Both of these Churches are true Churches, and thereforeneither of them is capable of erring in things essential. The Blazing Star burnsin both of them: the junction of the two triangles, one Divine and the otherhuman, — the regeneration of the individual soul, — takes effect in both ofthem. Yet these two Churches excommunicate each other! Why ? Because theseChurches are two Churches only, and not three. Because one whole side of themystical triangle is lacking in modern civilization. Because the Hamiticprinciple is to-day occulted. Because the Hamitic Church is nowhere visiblyorganized, and speaking with authority, among men. Because Man, the naturalmediator between heaven and earth, is officially absent from the religiousorganizations of the period.Now there are three holy cities, — not two of them only: Jerusalem, Rome, Paris.But the holiness of Paris is virtual merely as yet. The religion of Humanityreaches higher than the Commune and the International Labor Union seem to think.Paris is Bar-Isis, Parisis, Paris. It is the sacred boat of Isis that bearsto-day the destinies of the world.Brookline, Mass., July, 1871.Picture #30 [images/img_0030.png]APPENDIX.Picture #31 [images/img_0031.png]APPENDIXTHE KABBALA.The two kabbalistic* books that are of note are the Jetsirah (the Book of theCreation) and the Zohar. The Zohar is the Book of Splendor, — the book of “theshining ones” of whom it is written, “They that are wise shall shine (<nfTt%i-zhr-v) as the shining (intD, k-zhr) of the firmament.” — Dan. xii. 3.The Talmud f (the authoritative compendium for doctrine and practice among theorthodox Jews) directs that the theory of the creation (or the contents of thebook Jetsirah) shall never be taught to two persons at once; and the explanationof the mystical chariot described by the prophet Ezekiel (or the contents of thebook Zohar) not even to one, unless he be a man of approved wisdom, and then bya summary of the chapters only.The most important, and probably the best authenticated, of the documentsforming the collection of the Zohar, are the Siphra de Zeniutha (the Book ofOccupations, or of Mysteries), the Idra Babba (the Greater Assembly), and theIdra Suta (the Smaller Assembly). These three short* Kabbalah, that which is received (by tradition),f The Talmud is that which is taught (with authority).27Picture #32 [images/img_0032.png]28treatises are said by experts to contain the whole real substance of theKabbala; and taken together, in the order just mentioned, they form thecollection known as the lesser Zohar. In point of fact, however, the wholesubstance of the Kabbala is contained in the Zeniutha; for the Idra Rabba andthe Idra Suta consist of explanations and developments of the doctrines that aredarkly outlined in the Book of Mysteries. The last paragraph of the Zeniuthastands as follows: —“ Thus far, the Book of the King, or of Mysteries, or of Occultations, remainsinvolved and hidden. Happy is that man who goes in and comes out, and learns itspaths and its crossways/'The lesser Zohar is written in a corrupt Hebrew idiom, long ago consigned toutter disuse, called “the Jerusalem dialect.” Its three tracts, as we nowpossess them in the printed editions, are accompanied by Latin translations; andin the light thrown by the text on the translations, and by the translations onthe text, with the aid afforded by the internal harmonies of the doctrineexpounded, some parts of the expositions (if they may be called expositions)become distinctly intelligible.There are many treatises in French, Latin, and in other languages, nearly all ofthem easily accessible, containing general accounts of the kabbalistic doctrine,summaries of the various fragments of the Jetsirah and the Zohar, withexplanations of the signs, symbols, and of the language generally, of theKabbala; giving also practical directions for magical processes, theinterpretation of mysteries, the exercise of the prophetic art, and other likematters of interest. Whether the kabbalistic books themselves are harder tounderstand than the books written to explain them, or the converse, we do notassume to judge: we incline, however, to the suspicion, that, apart from thedifficulties of mere language, the commentaries are harder than the text.Picture #33 [images/img_0033.png]29The Book of Mysteries opens very obscurely, as follows : —“ The Book of Occnltatioiu (or of Mysteries) is the book of weighing in theBalance. Before this Balance was, face (the lesser aspect) answered not back toface (the greater aspect). [The Microprosopns looked not back upon theMacroprosopns.] And the ancient * kings (the symbolical kings of Edom, or theworlds that were first created, but could not subsist) were dead, and theirsustenance was nowhere found, and the earth was desolate (void, existingpotentially only), until the non-cognizable Head prepared vestments of honor,and bestowed them upon that which is longed for in all desires (or until theHoly One assumed the form and nature which involves all natures, and maintainsthem all). This Balance hangs in the place which exists not. Things which appearnot are weighed in it It is composed of that body whiph is neither compacted norseen. In it have ascended, and do now ascend, things which are not, and are, andshall be. Occultadon in occultation.” — The ZenisUha, chap. i. $ 1 to $ 9.The Masora is in every respect the converse of the Kabbala. The Masora is thatwhich was openly delivered by the Rabbi: the Kabbala is that which was secretlyand mysteriously received by the disciple.There was for the Kabbala, as there is for every thing else that grows up underthe protection of silence and darkness, a long period of incubation. Symbolspresented themselves from time to time to the minds of ingenious men, and wentinto occult circulation among adepts. Some of these symbols were illustrativepictures addressed to the eye, and others of them were enigmatic stories anddescriptions addressed to the ear. Century after century passed away before thedoctrine took its systematic and definitive♦ Kdnudn, eastern. Because the morning in the east is anteriorto the noon in the south, and to the evening in the west, the word eastern came,from very ancient times, to signify anteriority, whether natural ormetaphysical. Thus the phrase, 4‘ the eastern kings,” denoted either the firstkings in point of time, or the principlating kings. The “ ancient kings ” of thetext are prindpiating kings.8*Picture #34 [images/img_0034.png]30form. When the books came to be written, they were written, not to teach thedoctrine, but to furnish such a series of arbitrary mnemonic signs as wouldenable the initiated reader to hold the whole general theory, divided andsubdivided into its constituent parts, in one view before his mind. It is invain, therefore, that a man opens a kabbalistic book, if he have not beforehand,and. without the aid of the book, mastered the whole substance of its contents.The books furnish, not matter of teaching, but enigmatic reminders ofinformation already acquired. Moreover, the kabbalistic writers, aiming toconceal rather than to reveal their doctrine, affect preposterousness ofstatement.When Rabbi Simon ben Jochai * read {Gen. iii. 3), “ And they heard the voice ofthe Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day,” he refused tobelieve the things literally stated in the passage. He reasoned thus: “ Thepassage has a meaning; for it was written by the author of the Bereshithj f theliteral meaning is not the true one; for the literal meaning is absurd: thepassage has, therefore, some occult meaning, and that occult meaning is a propersubject for investigation.” Rabbi Simon and the other kabbalistic writers appearto imitate, in their own expositions, what they suppose to have been theenigmatic method of the author of the Bereshith.The Zohar is an explanation of the mystic chariot (r»M^73, Merkebah) that isdescribed in the first chapter of Ezekiel. The prophet Ezekiel, when he wasamong the captives which were by the River Chebar, saw visions of God. Thesevisions were obviously enigmatic. The prophet saw “ a fire infolding itself,”and in the midst of it “the likeness of four living creatures.” He saw also“wheels,” the work♦ R. Simon ben Jochai is mentioned by several of the kabbalistic writers as themaster who reduced the Kabbala to its definitive form.f The Hereshith (fTOWO, In the beginning) is the first part of the first book ofthe Hebrew Bible.Picture #35 [images/img_0035.png]81of which wag, “ as it were, a wheel within a wheel.” “The rings of the wheelswere full of eyes.” He saw also “ a firmament ” over the wheels and the livingcreatures, and the color thereof was “ as the color of the terrible crystal; ”and on this covering “ was the appearance of a throne of sapphirestone,” and“upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness of the appearance of a Manabove upon it.” * “ And theappearance of the brightness round about it was as the appearance of the bowthat is in the cloud in the day of rain,” or as the appearance of light when itis passing through transparent crystal.—Ezek. chap. i. We read, furthermore, —but this time it is the prophet Daniel who sees the vision, — “I beheld till thethrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was whiteas snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool: his throne was like the fieryflame, and his wheels as burning fire.” — Dan. vii. 9. A parallel vision isrecorded in the Apocalypse, where the meaning is, however, somewhat obscuredthrough the rendering of the term £omc (zoa, living creatures) by theunfortunate term “beasts.” Ezekiel says (x. 20), “This is the living creaturethat I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that theywere the cherubim.”The author of the Zeniutha,f having realized the vision of the Merkebah in hisimagination, expresses himself in the following extraordinary language: —“ The non-oognizable Head is framed and prepared (or is to be conceived) afterthe similitade of a skull (1) filled with crystalline dew (2). The coveringmembrane (3) of this skull is completely transparent, and♦ “ Then went up Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders ofIsrael (into the mount). And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under hisfeet as it were a paved work of a sapphire-stone, and as it were the body ofheaven in its clearness.Exod. xxiv. 9.10.t Rabbi Simon indicates very clearly, in the Idra Suta, that he himself was theauthor of the Zeniutha.Picture #36 [images/img_0036.png]Picture #37 [images/img_0037.png]32doeed; and from it hair (4 and 5) like white wool hangs on either side inequilibrium.*“ The supreme (6) Loving-kindness (the forehead of the Macroprosopus) revealsitself to the prayers of that which is below.“ Open Vision (the eyes of the Macroprosopus) slumbering never, but observingcontinually (7 and 8).“In the superior aspect (the Macroprosopus) are two apertures (the nostrils),through which the spirit (9) is called forth in all.“ The aspect which is below (10) answers to the aspect of the superior lights.\" ‘ In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.' — Gen. i. 1. Six(itniD> sheUia) created six (rnt) bara-shih). Upon these (six) depend all thingsthat are below. For that which is below depends upon the influences which arethe Head’s beard; but the second earth (the actual world) counts not among thesix. The existing earth is produced from another earth that bore the curse: asit is written (Gen. v. 21), ‘From the ground which the Lord had cursed/“ ‘ And the earth was without form, and void * (irQI inn, tbdhu va bohu, acollective potentiality of existence in a potentiality of existence); * anddarkness was upon the face of the deep ’ (D1nn> thehom, the Abyss). — Gen. i. 2.“ Thirteen (below) answer to the thirteen (influences of the beard). Sixthousand years (six numerations, or sephiroth, of the Microprosopus) answer tothe six first (the six of the Macroprosopus). The seventh thousand years (theseventh numeration or sephirah after the third, or Matrona, or Royalty) isapart, and over that which is vehement, and vehement only.“ And all was desolate for twelve hours, — the hours in which the earth wasformless and empty. But the vehemency was reconstructed in the thirteenth hourthrough mercy, and renewed. And all six persisted; for it is written, * Hecreated; * and afterwards it is written, * And the earth was: ’ so that thevehemency was a subsisting reality (although not an actuality, even whileexisting potentially only).” — The Zeniutha, chap, i. § 10 to § 24.* This figure, or symbol, is offensive to the imagination. It ought to be so.The writers of the Kabbala intentionally select emblems that are absurd, in badtaste, and utterly inadequate. Their emblems are mnemonio signs, or reminders,not illustrations. Apt aud beautiful symbols almost always give occasion toidolatrous practices. The Kabbala is so written that the mind of the intelligentadept is repelled by the sign, and passes at once to the consideration of thething signified.Picture #38 [images/img_0038.png]Picture #39 [images/img_0039.png]33These extracts are supposed to contain the essence of the Kabbala. We havetranslated them as we could, feeling our way darkly; and are confident that ourinterpretation is not very far from right.What is this Balance which hangs in the place that exists not, bearing in itsscales things that are not, and are, and shall be ? What is this Supreme Form(or nature) that involves all forms (or natures), and maintains them all ? Whoare these Kings of Edom that are, but exist not? What are these LivingCreatures, these man-headed, lionheaded, ox-headed, and eagle-headed Sphinxes*darkly referred to in the text, and of which the prophet Ezekiel says openly, “Iknew that they were the Cherubim”? It is more than possible that we may fail togive adequate answers to these questions. But the plan of our undertaking doesnot require that our answers should be adequate. The passages of which arendering has been submitted to the reader mean something; for Simon ben Jochaiwas the writer of them. Their obvious meanings are manifold, and destroy eachother. The statements are obviously, therefore, enigmatic. It shall be oureffort to give in a plain way, and in the ordinary language of metaphysics, suchnecessarily inadequate answers to the above-recited questions, and such partialinterpretations of the enigmas contained in the extracts, as will enable us toset forth, in a more or less satisfactory manner, the kabbalistic theory of theTen Sephiboth. This was the task we assigned to lourscives in the beginning. Weshall say very little of those parts of the doctrine that are protected to-dayby sworn obligations. Let no initiate be frightened beforehand ! We shall alsofortify our own expositions with copious extracts from the Idra Rabba and theIdra Suta, in order that our readers may be convinced that we say what theKabbala says, and are not passing off false coin upon them. Our readers will,necessarily, be few in number;Picture #40 [images/img_0040.png]34and for that reason, if for no other, we intend to treat them fairly. The Zoharsays, —“ Sometimes two Mekubbalim are found in the same city, and seven in a kingdom:at other times, only one is found in a city, and only two in a wholegeneration/*Nevertheless, the hooks of the Kabbala have been continually republished, firstby oral tradition from generation to generation, and then by expensive printededition after expensive printed edition, for the benefit of the few who care forthem: so that the doctrine has come down, almost intact, even to the presentday.The Kabbalutic Balance*Man knows himself to be soul and body, spontaneity and fatality, subject andobject, spirit and matter.Spontaneity and fatality — the first regarded as masculine, or initiative; andthe second as feminine, or responsive— are the two scales of that UniversalBalance in which all things are weighed. It is written in the Zohar, —“ When the Most Holy Elder, hidden in all occultations, willed to create, hemade all things in the form of husband and wife, conditioning the existence ofopposite sexes. — Idra Suta, § 218. Wisdom (r»53Dn, Chochmah) is the Father:Understanding Bin ah) is the Mother.Wisdom and Understanding are weighed in one Balance, as male and female. —Id.Sut., § 222. All things appear, therefore, in the form of husband and wife: wereit otherwise, nothing whatever could subsist. — Id. Sut., § 223. And this Fatherand Mother are called the house: as it is written (Prov. xxiv. 3), ‘ ThroughWisdom is a house builded, and by Understanding it is established/ — Id. Sut., §312. The male is a mere halfbody : so also the female. — Id. Sut., § 718.Blessings descend not upon mutilated and defective things, but upon that whichis complete,—not upon half-things. — Id. Sut., § 723. Half-things neithersubsist in eternity, nor receive blessings for eternity.”—Id. Sut., § 724.Picture #41 [images/img_0041.png]Heaven and Earth, the State and the Church, the Emperor and the Pope, Libertyand Authority, Revolution and Order, the Law and the Gospel, Private Opinion andPublic Opinion, the Intuitive Method and the Inductive Method, Poetry and Prose,Spontaneity and Fatality, Subject and Object, Spirit and Matter, and the like,are weighed, each over against its correlative, in that Universal Balance whichis Man and Woman, or rather Husband and Wife.Sometimes, in examining a kabbalistic couple, we find it difficult to determinewhich term is husband, and which is wife$ but the Kabbala furnishes a test. TheZohar says, —“All rigors that rise in the male are vehement in the beginning, and relaxed atthe end: those, however, that rise in the female, are mild in the beginning, batvehement at the end. — Idra Rabba, § 1026. And, were it not that these areconjoined, the world would not be able to bear them. The Elder of elders,therefore, separates them from each other, and then associates them that the/may assuage each other.*'—Id. Rab., $1027.Applying this test, we judge (with, however, many misgivings) that Heaven ismasculine, and the Earth feminine; the State masculine, and the Church feminine;the Emperor masculine, and the Pope feminine; and so on.The rigor that rises in the male, and that which rises in the female, subsist inthe analogy of correlative opposites: Each implies the other, is related to theother; and either, without the other, would be unprovoked, unmeaning,nonexistent, and void. Each is, however, a mystery to the other; and each, inaffirming itself, excludes the other: so that the two, unassuaged, stand as asubsisting contradiction. This contradiction is resolved when the two areweighed against each other in the Balance, and mutuality takes the place ofreciprocal isolation. In the Balance, like repels like, and union is establishedbetween contraries. The theory of the Balance is, therefore, the theory of thePicture #42 [images/img_0042.png]86reconciliation of contradictions. Now, there cannot be two hills without avalley between them; for, if there be no valley, the hills are not two hills,but the same hill. Absolute contradiction (or the affirmation that the samething in the same subject both is and is not) is a sign of nullity. If the samething could be at the same time both true and not true, and in the same sense,it would be useless for man to seek after truth. Kabbalistic contradictionssubsist, therefore, never absurdly in a single term, but always in two termsthat answer each other: they are always relative, and never absolute. It is onlywhen two affirmations imply each other as well as deny each other, assert eachother as well as exclude each other, that we know we are in the presence of acontradiction-pregnant, and on the eve of discovering a third term, in which thetwo discordant terms will find their synthetic harmony. Furthermore, a singleaffirmation of a contradiction being given, and not both of them, it is onlywhen the given affirmation, carefully considered, presents its own refutation,and when the refutation, in its turn, re-affirms the original proposition, thatwe have the promise of a coming synthesis.The Kabbala affirms that all things are constructed, and held in being, inaccordance with the principle of the contradiction-pregnant. “ Before theBalance was, face answered not to face, and the earth was void.” It follows,therefore, if the Kabbala be true, that the method of contradictions is theauthentic method of philosophic and scientific investigation.We permit ourselves to remark, in this place, that a man ought never to beregarded as being substantially the same thing as a woman, or a woman assubstantially the same thing as a man, each existing as the other, but withdefect: for men and women are kabbalistic correlatives of each other, notdefects of each other; and their essential value consists in their sharpreciprocal contradistinction from each other.Picture #43 [images/img_0043.png]87Men and women ought always to be kabbalistically united with each other insynthetic marriage, and never joined in simple partnership. Our women’s-rightspeople are wholly wrong in this particular. Man divorced from woman, religionfrom science, love from knowledge, force from gentleness, pity from justice, andthe converse, are worse than barren: they are destructive. Every kabbalisticcouple should be regarded as a true couple, not as two varieties of the samething. Men and women are analogies of each other, not aspects of each other. Theopposing terms of such couples should be contradistinguished, not that a choicemay be made between them, not that one may be sacrificed to the other, orsubjugated by the other, but that both may be accepted, and the two weighedagainst each other in the Balance in actual marriage; for, in the kabbalisticmarriage, we obtain distinction without antagonism, union without uniformity,order without despotism, and a complete analysis resolved by a completesynthesis. So long as the two terms of a kabbalistic couple stand unreconciled,they are the occasion of sorrow, suffering, want, oppression, and wrong; theyare the material itself of evil: but, as soon as they are married, they generateand bring forth harmony and beauty.We have been able, but under cover of much darkness, to aet forth, thus far, thetheory of the Kabbalistic Balance. In this Balance the whole doctrine of theZohar hangs. Aa we go on with our exposition, the theory will become, bydegrees, clearer and clearer.Harmony subsists by the resolution of contraries. Analogy is either sameness oflaw with diversity of attributes, or it is diversity of law with sameness ofattributes. Analogy is the key that unlocks the secret of the universe. Aneffort that wastes itself in the void counts not at all. That, and that only,supports, which also resists. He that suffers, grows ; he that enjoys, wilts.Prosperity is harder to bear4Picture #44 [images/img_0044.png]38than adversity. Evil and wrong should provoke pity, not anger. So long as manshall remain progressive in his nature, evil will be a condition of hisexistence. Evil is necessary. Injustice, hostility, disappointment, want,obscurity, and neglect discipline human spontaneity, and enable it to assert itsown.In disputed questions of faith, the habbalist espouses both sides of thecontroversy. To the kabbalist, the doctrine of irresistible grace on the oneside, and of man’s responsibility on the other, which arrays the Calvinistsagainst the followers of Arminius, and the converse, is nothing other than acontradiction-pregnant susceptible of strict scientific solution. The firstvirtue of a wise man is that of entire toleration of opinions. All men knowpartially and defectively. A few men know both sides of certain specialquestions. The Supreme, and he only, knows the whole.The Cherubim.The word cherub * is complex, technical, and artificial It is composedarbitrarily of two elements: one signifying the act of carving, or engraving; fand the other signifying multitudinousness, t The cherubim of the tabernaclewere not, as might be supposed from the analyses of the word, carved, or graven,images, but were images that had been hammered into shape. It is written {Exod.xxv. 13), —“ Thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work shalt thou make them, inthe two ends of the mercy-seat.”The cherubim of the temple were, however, of carved work; for it is written (1Kings vi. 23-29), —* 2V\"0, fcruft, cherub.t hr. This Hebrew element indicates distinctive marks, graving?, characters;also the act of engraving, and engraving-tools. It Is found in the English wordscarve and engrave. It aiso indicates all kinds of excavations, incisions, orpits: lienee the English word grave. t rby multitude, abundance.Picture #45 [images/img_0045.png]89“ And, within the oracle, Solomon made two cherubim of olive-tree, each tencubits high. . . . And he overlaid the cherubim with gold. And he carved all thewalls of the house round about with carved figwrm of cherubim and palm-trees andopen flowers, within and without.”The following extract from Layard’s “ Nineveh ” (voL iL p. 352) willsufficiently describe the external form of the kabbalistic cherubim: —“ Ezekiel saw in his vision the likeness of four living creatures, which hadfour faces, four wings, and the hands of a man under their wings on their foursides. Their faces were those of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. By them wasa wheel, the appearance of which was, as it were, a wheel in the middle of awheel. It will be observed that the four forms chosen by Ezekiel to illustratehis description — the man, the lion, the bull, and the eagle—are precisely thosewhich are constantly found on Assyrian monuments as religious types.”The prophet Ezekiel says (x. 8-20), —“ And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man’s hand under their wings.. . . And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub (orof an ox: compare i. 10); and the second face was the face of a man; and thethird, the face of a lion; and the fourth, the face of an eagle. . . . This isthe Living Creature (fFn, chyh) that I saw under the God of Israel by the RiverChebar; and I knew that they were the cherubimIt is written in the New Testament (Apoc. iv. 6, 7), —M And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts(£a>a, xoa, living creatures), full of eyes before and behind. And the firstbeast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast hada face as a man, and the fourth beast was like allying eagle.”In art, the evangelist Matthew is usually represented as accompanied by a man;the evangelist Mark, by a lion; tho evangelist Luke, by an ox; and theevangelist John, by an eagle. Thus the kabbalistic cherubim are made to stand assymbols of the four Gospels.Picture #46 [images/img_0046.png]40The cherubim described as carved upon the walls of the ideal temple (which wasnever built) had two faces only,— the face of a young lion, and the face of aman.—Ezek. xli. 19. It is probable that the golden calf made by Aaron, and thegolden calves set up by King Jeroboam,—one in Beth-el and the other in Dan, —were cherubim.The general outward aspect of the cherubim is now sufficiently indicated.The particular four-faced, winged, and flying cherubim of Ezekiel’s vision arethe kabbalistic cherubim, whose special enigmatic characteristics were probablyborrowed by the prophet, as symbols, from the ancient worship of Tyre and Sidon,— a worship akin to that of Babylon, but differing from it by being truer to theprimitive Hamitic traditions. We will dwell for a moment on this point. We read(Ezek. xxviii. 11,16),—“ The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, take up a lamentationupon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus soith the Lord God: Thou seolostup the sum, exact in number, and perfect in coinage. Thou hast been in Eden, thegarden of God: every precious stone was thy covering,—the sardius, the topaz,and the diamond; the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper; the sapphire, the emerald,and the carbuncle ; and gold. . • . Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth;and I have set thee so. Thou wast upon the holy mountain of God. Thou hastwalked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire (or splendor). Thou wastperfect iu thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was foundin thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise thou hast been filled, iu the midstof thee, with violence; thou hast sinned: therefore will I.cast thee as profaneout of the mountain of God; and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub! from themidst of the stones of fire.”Tyre ought certainly to have made common cause, from the beginning, withJerusalem, against King Nebuchadnezzar, and should never have allowed the twocities to be attacked and overwhelmed in detail. Insanity was epidemic among thekings of the epoch. The king of TyrePicture #47 [images/img_0047.png]41insanely identified, in his own mind, the totality of his people, and also hispeople’s god, with his own person. “ This, his power, became his god.” In theblind egotism of his insanely assumed godhead, he betrayed Jerusalem to herenemies, and thus broke down the barrier that had separated between SlingNebuchadnezzar and himself After the eyes of the king of Tyre had been fullyopened, by the experience of events, to the fatal consequences of his ownselfish bad faith, the prophet, with, as it were, an instinctive sense of theproper local coloring, taunted him, and insulted him with deliberate purpose. Itis not without a sentiment of bitter and pitiless irony, or without a distinctknowledge that the poisoned shaft would hit, that Ezekiel addresses the king ofTyre by the title, “0 covering cherub! ”The breastplate of judgment, suspended from the neck of the Jewish high priest,had, in the first row, a topaz, a sardius, and a carbuncle; it had, in thesecond row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond; in the third row, a ligure,an agate, and an amethyst; and, in the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and ajasper. The precious stones that were “the covering” of the king of Tyre, were,as far as they went, the jewels of the breastplate of judgment. Thefoundationstones of the wall of the New Jerusalem are as follows: a jasper, asapphire, and a chalcedony; an emerald, a sardonyx, and a sardius; a chrysolite,a beryl, and a topaz; a chrysoprasus, a jacinth, and an amethyst. And the twelvegates are twelve pearls. The chief god of Tyre was represented in the Tyriantemple by a perfectly clear emerald as large as a man’s two fists. The worshipof stones was still extant in Tyre at the time the prophet wrote.It now remains for us to determine the symbolical signification of thesehammered and graven images, and to discover, if we can, why it was that themeaning multitudinousness was made to enter into the very structure of the wordcherub.4*Picture #48 [images/img_0048.png]42In modem poetical usage, the cherubim appear as angels. We may, however, dismissat once this interpretation of the symbol, since it receives no sanctionwhatever from Scripture. The Living Creatures of the Apocalypse were obviouslynot angels; for we read (v. 3-10), —“ And, when he had taken the book, the fonr living creatures (zoa) and the fourand twenty elders fell down before the Lamb: and they sang a new song, saying,Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; for thou wastslain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongueand people and nation ; and bast made us unto our God kings and priests, and weshall reign in the earth.”The words, “ Out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people,” give us anintimation that the symbolical Living Creatures mentioned in Scripture arecomplex beings, and that the individuals of which they are composed are nothingother than men. The indication is confirmed by an inspection of the followingamong other passages: —\" Thou, O God! didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thineinheritance when it was weary. Thy congregation chyth-ka, thy Living Creature)hath dwelt therein. — Ps. Ixviii: 9,10. And the Philistines were gatheredtogether into a troop (rPnb> fechyehj into a Living Creature) where was a pieceof ground full of lentils. — 2 Sam. xxiii. 11. And the troop (rPn, chyth, theLiving Creature) of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.”—ver. 13.. The books of grammar say that collective nouns, the names of kinds and sorts,do not designate realities ; but the books of grammar are not always ofauthority in matters philosophical. We must divest ourselves of the prejudicewhich causes us to see in special societies nothing but beings of the mind, mereabstract names, serving to designate aggregations, of men. There is something inevery constituted society more than the mere aggregate, the mere unity oftotality, of the individuals composing it. . Is thePicture #49 [images/img_0049.png]48state, quoad state, nothing? the church, quoad church, nothing? the army, quoadarmy, nothing? the work-shop, quoad an organization of industry, nothing ? When,in the order of Providence, the organic unity of a particular people is broken,that people finds, to its extreme cost, that a mere aggregation of individualsnever suffices to constitute a people. The voice of the majority of a people, oreven the voice of all its individual members, may be something very differentfrom that organic voice of the people which is (said to be) the voice of God. Tothe true philosopher, society is a living creature, endowed with an intelligenceand an activity of its own, governed by special laws, which are discoverable byobservation, and by observation only; and whose existence is manifested, notunder a material aspect, but by the dose concert and the mutual interdependence(the solidarity) of all the members of the social body.The maxim, “The voice of the people is the voice of God,” is very ancient. Inmany of the Shemitic countries, the collective people was the occult god of theindividual members of the people. The kings of Assyria continually affected toidentify themselves with Asshur, the common ancestor of the whole people, andtherefore the symbol of the collective people, and the occult god of the people.Louis XIV. said, “I am the state:” the kings of Assyria went further, and said,“We are Assyria and Asshur.” But the claim of the Assyrian kings to divinehonors seems to have been always resisted. Self-deification was the form takenby the royal insanity of the period.*“ God standeth in the congregation of the mlghtj He Jodgeth among the goda... •I hare said, Te are goda,And all of yon children of the Moat High;But ye shall die like men,And fall like one of the princea.Arise, O Godl judge the earth:< For it ia thoa that ahalt inherit allnations.* —Ps. lxxxil.Picture #50 [images/img_0050.png]44A chebub is a hammered or graven image that is enigmatically representative of aLiving Creature, — of a collective man. A political meeting is a LivingCreature, bearing the likeness of a man ; for the mass of the assembly is itsbody, the moderator is its executive faculty, and the orators and managers arethe active intelligence. A nation is a Living Creature, whose body is composedof the mass of citizens, whose will, is organized in the executive element,whose intelligence resides in the legislature, and whose active conscience —that is, whose passions and instinctive tendencies, as tempered down andrendered permanent by the joint action of the memory and the legislativejudgment — resides in the judiciary. Because the individuals of a nation becomeone by thus subsisting in relations of mutual interdependence (of solidarity),because they are thus brought into the form of a collective man, they actuallybecome a collective entity, capable of collective virtue and crime. Nationscommit national sins. And it cannot be affirmed that the Social Unity is theresult of a social compact ; for the actor is always prior to its acts ; and thesocial compact, since it is the act and product of the Social Organism, supposesthe prior existence of this Organism. No national constitution can ever be patin operation that does not exist in the order of Providence, or in that ofdestiny, before it is written on paper.A mature people has, however, no real personality. It is only while a people isin a condition of mental and moral minority, while it is as yet under age, thatit takes to itself a king or an emperor, in order that it may theatrically andfictitiously represent itself in the personality of its executive chief Themadness of a people is correlative with the madness of its rulers. When a peoplebecomes mature, its government becomes impersonal. Self-government, or thegovernment of the organic people, is equivalent to the substitution ofresponsible administration in the stead of govPicture #51 [images/img_0051.png]45eminent. “ The best government ia that which governs least.” A true society,although it is a real entity, although it is a Living Creature, is never aperson.One of the two cherubim of the tabernacle was an emblematic representative ofthe collective body made up of the children of Leah, and the other was a symbolof the collective body made up of the children of Rachel When the high priestentered, once a year, into the Holy of Holies, and there looked upon theShechinah enthroned between the cherubim, he saw the symbol of what met hiseyes, in its reality, when he came back into the camp.According to the Hebrew religion, Israel was not, in the desert and inPalestine, as Asshur was in Assyria, the occult god of the people, but was, onthe contrary, a mere cherub, having his station under the throne of the God ofIsrael*Israel, to the minds of the inspired prophets, was a very mysterious personage.Israel was the father of the nation. Israel was the nation itself — thecollective child of Israel Israel was also the spirit that co-ordinated the massof the people into one organic whole, — into one Living Creature. Israel wasFather, Son, and Spirit. In the view of the more inspired of the prophets,Israel, as the Son, as the Israelitish people itself was a vicarious sacrificefor the nations. It is written (Isa. lil 13-liii. 11), —“ Behold, my servant shall prosper. . . .Many shall he amazed at the sight of him.His face is marred more than that of other men;And his form is so disfigured os to be scarcely human.So shall he deliver many nations,And kings shall shat their months before him. . . .He hath no comeliness to draw attention,* It is supposed that the setting-up of the golden calf in the desert was anattempt to overthrow the true Hebrew religion, and to substitute the worship ofthe collective Hebrew people, as a cherubic god, in the stead of the worship ofJehovah.Picture #52 [images/img_0052.png]Picture #53 [images/img_0053.png]46Nor beauty that men should take pleasure in him.He is despised and rejected of men;A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. • • •He was wounded for our transgressions,And bruised for our iniquities.For our peace the chastisement was laid upon him,And by his stripes we are healed. • . .He shall see the travail of his soul, and be satisfied.By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many;For he shall bear their iniquities/1Who is this servant that is thus smitten for the welfare of the nations? Let theScriptures themselves answer, is written (.Isa. xli. 8, 9), —“ But thou, O Israel / art my servant,Thou, Jacob, whom I have chosen,The seed of Abraham, my friend, —Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth.And called from the boundaries thereof,Saying unto thee, Thou art my servant”And again (xliv. 1,2), —“ Hear now, O Jacob, my servant,And Israel whom I have chosen!Thus 8aith Jehovah that made thee,That formed thee from the womb, and will help thee:Fear not, O Jacob, my servant, —Jesurun, whom I have chosen I ”And again (xlix. 3), —“ Thou art my servant,0 Israeli iu whom I will be glorified.”And again (xlii. 1,7), —“ Behold my servant, whom I uphold;Mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth!1 have put my spirit upon, him:He shall bring forth judgment to the nations. . . •Picture #54 [images/img_0054.png]47He ihall not fail, nor be discouraged.Till he bare set justice in the earth;And distant nation* shall wait for his law. . • •If Jehovah, hare called thee in righteousness,And will hold thee by the hand,And will moke thee a covenant to the people,And a light to the nation*”Perhaps the first authentic instance, in recorded literature, of a completedevelopment of the sentiment of universal good will to man, is the one found inthe words (Gen. xiL 3), u And in thee (Abram) shall all the families of theearth be blessed” Israel always regarded itself as the chosen people, but aschosen to be the Christ of the. nations, —the instrument through which the lawof Jehovah was to go forth to all the families of the earth.We come now to the turning-point of the Kabbala, — the essence of the Kabbala.And we request the reader to bear in mind, while he is reading what we are aboutto say, that the writings of Mr. John Locke and of M. Condillac were not to befound on the shelves of the book-stalls in ancient Tyre, Sidon, Babylon,Jerusalem, and Memphis: if they had been found there, the demand for them wouldprobably have been smalL We are disposed to defend nothing, and to answer fornothing; for it is our purpose, in this place, to state, to the best of ourability, the extraordinary doctrines of the Kabbala in their simplest form, toexplain them as well as we can, and then leave them to defend themselves.If Asshur, Mizraim, Israel, Gog, Magog, and the like, are to be recognized ascovering cherubs, then much more is Adam (the collective-man, Humanity) to berecognized as a superior covering cherub. ’'Above the heads of the cherubim,Ezekiel saw in his vision the likeness of a firmament, and over the firmamentthe appearance of a throne, “and on the throne the likeness of the appearance,as it were, of a man.” The Kabbala affirms that the ideal HuPicture #55 [images/img_0055.png]48manity, the Adam which was from the beginning, before ever the earth was, andwho is above, is the First-born of the Ancient of days, and that .by him theheavens and the earth were created. The Kabbala affirms, further, that Adam,—thefirst Adam, Adam Kadmon, — unlike other cherubim, has a distinct personalexistence ; that he is, in truth, the Mighty Ood, existing from eternity,anterior to both individual men and the visible worlds, and the efficaciouscause through which both man and the universe exist. We will adduce, six oreight pages farther on, some of the reasons brought forward by the Kabbala tosustain its singular statement, that God, as Creator, assumes the form of a man.The Kabbala differs, in almost every respect, from the modem theory ofPositivism ; but the kabbalists resemble a portion of the positivists in oneparticular, inasmuch as they set forth their doctrine as “ the Religion ofHumanity.”According to the Kabbala, God is known by his names only. Each one of the Hebrewnames of God is a special revealed aspect of the Nameless One. Of the NamelessOne man knows nothing whatever, save the bare fact that he exists. [Thiskabbalistic truth has been recently and quite independently rediscovered by Mr.Herbert Spencer, who has published it to the world in the beginning of his bookof “ First Principles.”] The Scriptures are explicit in affirming that “no mancan see God, and live.” Zophar, one of Job’s comforters, inquires, “ Canst thouby searching find out God?” St. Paul says of the Supreme, that he dwells inlight unapproachable; and that no feye hath seen him, or can see him. John theBaptist testifies, saying, “No man hath seen “God at any time : theonly-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.”The Nameless One is called, in the Kabbala* ppo pat (j&n-Soph), the Limitless,or Name no name. For thatPicture #56 [images/img_0056.png]49which, is known and named, is known and named, not from its substance, but fromits limitations; and scientific men correctly aver, that whatsoever isunlimited, undefined, undassifiable, is necessarily outside of natural science.Among the names of God which are known to men, the most occult is nVrtt(.AEhieh, I AM), the Ancient of days, called by the kabbalists nro (Kether, theCrown): this is the first sephirah, numeration, or revealed aspect of God. Thenext in order is designated by the kabbalists as n (Chokmah, Wisdom), theFirst-born of the Ancient of days, and identified by the kabbalists with theideal or principiating man, the Adam who is above: this is the second sephirah.The third sephirah is (Binah, Understanding), which may be identified with theGreek Logos. Chokmah is masculine: Binah is feminine.It is written in the Zohar, —“ And the Lord said (Gen. vi. 7), * I will destroy man whom I have created fromthe face of the earth; both man and beast, and the creeping thing, and thefowls/ &c. Here a distinction is made between the man who is of the earth, andthe man who is above; for the earthly man is not alone indicated in this place,since the earthly man without the heavenly man cannot be. For, without fitMn(Chokma, Wisdom, the man who is above, the authentic Adam), all things would beocculted. . . . If this IHfit (Adam) should not exist, there would be no world.. . . This Wisdom that is hidden (this true Adam) institutes and corroboratesthe form of man, that man may be established in his own place. . . . This trueAdam is the inward form, the spirit . . . And in this inward form, which isseated on the throne, the perfection of all things appears. As it is written(Ezek. i. 26), * Above the heads of the Living Creatures was the likeness of athrone, . . . and on the throne the appearance of a Man/ Ac. It is also written(Z>on. vii. 13), * I saw, in the night, visions, and, behold, one like unto theSon of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came unto the Ancient of days. .. . And there was given to him dominion and glory, and a kingdom. . . . Hisdominion is an everlasting dominion that shall never pass away, and his kingdomthat which shall not be destroyed.’ ” — Id. Rab., $ 1119 to § 1130.6Picture #57 [images/img_0057.png]50Man, the Form of All Things.Some men ask, “How can the chasm which separates between perception and theobject of perception be bridged over ? How can it be made certain, for instance,when men feel and see a tree, that there is a real tree in nature answering tothe impressions made upon the senses?” Other men reply to them by asking, \" Howwill you bridge over a chasm that never existed ? ” Perception is an act oflife, containing in itself, synthetically, the perceiver and the thingperceived. When a man perceives a tree, he perceives that he perceives it; and,when he perceives that he is perceiving, he distinguishes between the perceivingsubject and the object perceived, but without separating them. The subject andobject of perception are weighed over against each other, and syntheticallymarried, in the Kabbalistic Balance ; and, when they are taken out of theBalance, the perception ceases to exist.Outward objects make pictures of themselves on the retina of the eye: but noliving subject was ever conscious of any picture on the retina of his own eye;and no living man ever passed, by induction, from the conscious perception ofsuch a picture in his own eye to the affirmation of the outward existence thatproduced it. If there is no direct communication between the soul and the world,between spirit and matter, perception is impossible. If the soul pannot directlyperceive an outward object because the soul is spiritual and the object ismaterial, then the soul cannot (as, in fact, it does not) perceive the pictureon the retina of the eye; for that also is material Neither can the soulperceive a picture of the picture; for that, in like manner, is afflicted withthe taint of matter. The same may be said of a picPicture #58 [images/img_0058.png]51tare of a picture of the picture; and so on to infinity. There is no chasm to bebridged. Perception is direct; and the supposed chasm, if any be supposed, is amere nothing gratuitously created by the imagination.What is matter? It is that which affects the senses. It is that which men see,hear, taste, smell, and feel. But to affect the senses is to act: even to affectthe sense of touch by mere resistance is to act; for resistance is action. Whoknows any thing about the mysterious transcendental substance that is said tounderlie all the activities of matter? If it exist at all, it exists not forman; or, at the least, it exists not for man’s senses; for (being by its natureinert) it produces no impression upon the senses: it exists, therefore, to man,as a mere abstraction cognizable by the mind. Matter is revealed by itsactivities only; and, to man, it 1? farce. What is spirit ? Spirit is revealedby its activities only: it is force. Matter and spirit are both of them forces.There is no reason why the two should not meet directly, in conjunction; andthey do so meet Every act of sensation shows a direct conjunction of matter andspirit. ^Man is the Kabbalistic Balance. The human body is I the theatre in which theconjunction and synthesis of the. activities of the soul, with the activities ofexternal nature, take effect When a man feels any thing with the ends of hisfingers, does he feel the feeling, or the feeling of the feeling, *or thefeeling of the feeling of the feeling ? or does he feel the thing ? He feels thething.Things not related to other things exist potentially only. When they come forthfrom potentiality, they do so by entering into relations. No isolated thingexists actually, or can so exist. The interdependence of existing things uponeach other is called their solidarity. All things exist in solidarity; nototherwise. Things may be transmuted in ^ solidarity, — coal may take the form ofashes and gas, water that of ice or of steam, sugar that of alcohol and residue,Picture #59 [images/img_0059.png]52and so on, — or material things may subsist, for a time, in a state of abeyance;but if any portion of matter, however inconsiderable, should be literallyannihilated, the whole universe would at once collapse back into the aboriginal,doubly-occulted invisible Abyss of potentiality in potentiality (thohu va bohu).All things subsist in everchanging relations to each other, and not otherwise.Man is so related to the universe, and the universe is so related to man, thatthe two are aspects and conditions of each other. Neither can exist without theother. That kabbalistic form of man which is also the form of the universe hnothing other than the adaptation of the universe to the existence of man, andof man to the existence of the universe.It is the doctrine of the Kabbala, that the universe first* existed in thecondition of potentiality in potentiality, afterwards in that of simplepotentiality; and that the worlds were brought forth, finally, out ofpotentiality into actuality in the bond of solidarity, by the appearance, inactuality, of Adam, Humanity, the Collective Man. It is for this reason that theAdam from above is frequently characterized as the Maker of the worlds, or as heby whom the heavens and the earth are created. It is written in the Zohar, —i“Before the Ancient of days had assumed his form, notliing was framed that wasthen to be framed; and all the worlds were void (existed potentially only).” —Id. Raft., 518.“Before the Elder of elders assumed his form, he sculptured the Kings, arrangedthe Kings, and gave proportions to the Kings; but they subsisted not. And thisis signified in the words (Gen. xxxvi. 32), * These are the kings that reignedin the land of Edom before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.*In the land of Edom; that is, in the place which consists wholly in rigor.**—Id.Rab., 513, 514.“ Why were the ancient worlds unable to subsist 1 Because man was* Logically first, not chronologically; for the evolutions here spoken oftake place outside of time.Picture #60 [images/img_0060.png]58not yet made. The constitution of man contains all things in its form; and, inaccordance with man's form, all things may be disposed and distributed.— Id.Rob,, | 623, § 524. It is written (Ezek. i. 26), ‘And above the firmament thatwas over the heads of the Living Creatures was the likeness of a throne, as theappearance of a sapphire-stone; and over the likeness of the throne was thelikeness as the appearance of a mah upon it9 As the appearance of a man, becauseman includes all forms. As the appearance of a man, because man includes allnames. As the appearance of a man, because man includes all mysteries that werespoken and set forth before the creation of those first worlds which subsistednot99—Id. Rab., g 611, g 512.“ These kings that reigned in the land of Edom, the place where aM rigor isfound, were of feminine constitution. — Id. Rob., 984. And they did not persist:they were not utterly abolished; but they did not persist; for they were fromthat part where all is feminine, and wherein there is no masculinity atall.\"—Id. Rait., 991.“ Outside of the constitution of man, nothing subsists. The ancient worlds werenot abolished, but were removed out of their own forms until the form of Adamshould appear. —Id. Rab., 525,526. When Adam was mode, the ancient worlds werecalled forth again, but under other names; and were brought into a permanentstate through those new names; so that they now appear in their place, but withnames other than they had at first\" — Id. Rab., 531.“ Before the worlds were made, face answered not to face: and therefore thefirst worlds were void and waste; for the first worlds were destitute of form.Those worlds appeared, shone, and were extinguished; as, when the red-hot ironon the blacksmith’s anvil is smitten with the hammer, sparks blase forth onevery side, shine for an instant, and then go out They were destroyed, and wentout, because the Most Holy Elder had not produced forms, and because the workmanwas not yet at his work. — Id. Rab., g 420 to 1494. Afterwards the workmanapplied himself to his work, assuming form. — Id. Rab., $ 427. Ancient is thehabitation of the Elder of elders; and he sits on the throne of the sparks thathe may subjugate them.\" — Id. Rab., $ 40.It is obvious from the context that these kings of Edom are nothing other thanarbitrary kabbalistic signs, or enigmatic symbols, denoting the worlds that werefirst made, but which subsisted not. Elsewhere, the Zohar speaks, much to thesame effect, as follows, of these kings of Edom: —6*Picture #61 [images/img_0061.png]54“ Before the Elder of elders, the most hidden of hidden things, Instituted theforms of the Kings, and of the diadems of diadems, there was neither beginningnor ending. The Elder of elders, therefore, excavated, and institutedproportions in himself, and spread before himself a veil; and in that veil hesculptured and distributed the kings in their due proportions; but they did notsubsist. And this is what is written (Gen. xxxvi. 29): * These are the kingsthat reigned in the land of Edom,’ &c. And the names were called of all thosekings that were sculptured; but not one of them subsisted.” — Id. Rab., $ 30 to$ 33.Thus far, the writers of the Zohar have spoken of the influence of theCollective Adam in establishing and maintaining the constitution of theuniverse. It would appear from other passages that they attribute no meanimportance to the influence of individual men and women in sustaining orchanging the order of nature. We quote one of these passages: —“ R. Simon said to the companions, When that veil was expanded which you sawabove us, I beheld all forms appearing in it, and shining in their places. — Id.Rab., § 494. I see those forms shining now above it, waiting for the words ofour mouths, that they may be crowned, and each one taken to its place ; and, asthey are explained by our mouths, they come forward, and are crowned, and aredisposed in the order determined by our speech. — Id. Rab., § 501. Blessed areye in the world to come; for all the words that have come out of your mouths areholy and true, neither declining to the right hand nor to the left.”—Id. Rab., §504.This last passage bears upon the kabbalistic theory of magic. To personsignorant of the fact of universal solidarity, and who deny the immediate contactof spirit with matter, magical changes in the order of society, or in that ofthe universe, seem, from the very nature of the case, to be impossible. TheMekubbalim have always, nevertheless, justly or unjustly, had the reputation ofbeing magicians and miracle-workers. In magical processes, man first realizeschanges in his own body, especially changes in his nervous system; and thenthrough his body, which is itself a part of nature, he affects the order eitherof human sociPicture #62 [images/img_0062.png]55ety or of the material universe. But, in the solidarity of nature, action andre-action are equal. Man is, therefore, himself the straining and groaningfulcrum whereon he rests his own lever when he exerts magic power. He loses ineffort, suffering, or humiliation, all that he gains in supremacy. In realizingthe practical fruit of his exertions, he pays for it precisely all that it ismaterially worth to him. It appears, therefore, that men who work magically areinduced to do so by motives of scientific curiosity, of disinterestedbenevolence, or of wanton and deep-seated malignity, not self-interest. It isreported that such of the kabbalists as have had the reputation of workingmiracles have all of them died suddenly, and nearly all of them violent deaths.Every exertion of human activity, outside the normal channels of old-fashionedlabor, breeds violent and dangerous re-actions. We entertain the suspicion thatfhonest labor is the only genuine magic.The problem of remunerative labor — which involves the exceptional andworld-famous problem of man’s will and efficacy, and, consequently, the problemsof his freedom, and of his possible merit and demerit, to say nothing of thecontradictions inherent in the nature of property (which is a product of labor)— is essentially kabbalistic. It is a special sub-section of the general theoryof magic.It is not difficult to justify the methods of the Kabbala from the standpoint ofmodem physical science. According to the scientific men, a thing is known whenit has been compared with certain other things, distinguished from certainothers, and classed as of this or that order. An object is said to be littleknown when it has little in common with things of which experience has been had,and well known when it has much, &c. A thing is said to be completely known whenits community with other things is recognized as complete, and completelyunknown when there is no recognized community at all. The scientific methodconsistsPicture #63 [images/img_0063.png]£6of observation, comparison, induction, verification by experiment, &c. Butobservations and experiments are acts that take place in time; and, between suchacts, intervals frequently occur. Induction is built up from a comparison of theresults of observations or of experiments, or both; and such comparison involvesan exercise of the memory. Now, upon what solid ground does the scientific manbase his confidence in his own mental processes ? For example, how does he knowthat events suggested to him by his memory really occurred ? If the human mindtestify of herself, her testimony is not valid. The scientific man, obviously,bases his scientific truth and certainty upon principles of whose validity hehas no scientific certainty whatever. To that extent, therefore, he is entirelyafloat. The scientific man escapes this difficulty by saying that his knowledgeis human 'knowledge, not absolute knowledge; that he accepts his naturalfaculties for better or worse, studying the laws of their action, and guardinghimself, to the best of his ability, against error. He affirms that hispostulates and conclusions are true, provided the human faculties he possesses,and the natural processes of reasoning, are trustworthy; not otherwise.The real method of the Kabbala is identical with the method of modern science.The object investigated by modem science is the world of nature; while thatinvestigated by the kabbalistic philosophy is, primarily, the spiritusd world,and afterwards the material world as dependent upon, and affected by, thespiritual world. The objects investigated differ: the method of investigation isthe same.' The Kabbala implicitly affirms, as postulates, a conviction of man’s existenceas a sentient and thinking being; a confidence in the evidence of the senses asverified by the understanding; a conviction that every event must have a cause,and a cause adequate to the effect; and, finally, a confidence in the uniformityof the operations of spirit andPicture #64 [images/img_0064.png]57matter, or that the same cause, acting in the same circumstances, will alwaysproduce the same effect.The Kabbala claims to be that spontaneous philosophy^ which man, quoad man,naturally affirms now, always has affirmed, and always will affirm so long asman is man. The worlds affirmed by the Kabbala are worlds known to man, — worldsupon which man has set the seal of his own nature, — worlds related to man, andof which man is the authentic form. Spinoza says there are an infinite number |of worlds, and that two only of them all are known to man, —the world of space,and the world of thought Spinoza is more knowing than the Kabbala; for theKabbala knows nothing of things whereof man is naturally ignorant. There isnothing in the Kabbala that is not given in the nature of man.The Kabbala affirms implicitly, as a postulate, that every I event must have anadequate cause; and that the same cause, acting in the like circumstances,always produces like effects. In so affirming, the Kabbala affirms the realityof the fact of causation. The Kabbala also asserts, by implication, that,naturally admitting the fact of causation, the human mind instinctively affirmsthe existence of God as Creator of the heavens and the earth. God as Creator, /is, according to the Kabbala, God in one of his names, and that not his highestname. This name (the Creator) is anthropomorphic. Man can conceive of God as heexisted without the worlds, before the creation: he thus forms a conception ofGod as the Ancient of days, as the Elder of elders, — a name higher than that ofGod as Creator of the world. The name ^Ehieh, I AM, the Elder of elders, whichis the highest given among men, is still anthropomorphic.If man, by the process of abstraction, take away all elements of human form fromhis conception of the Ancient of days, his thought falls back upon that realNothing which is the Nameless One, — a-Soph. When man, inPicture #65 [images/img_0065.png]58meditating upon God, soars above God’s names, Lis thought becomes lost; for hemeditates upon that which is, but exists not. Man knows nothing, and canconceive of nothing, that is absolutely outside of his own form.Man was created in the image of God; not in the image of the Nameless One,however, who has no image, but in the image of God as known by his names. Weread in the Zohar, —“ Man subsists through that which is analogous to himself, and not otherwise.But what is analogous to man ? The Holy Name. Therefore it is written (Gen. ii.7), ‘Jehovah Elohim created man.’ Man was created in the full name, which isJehovah Elohim, and analogous to man. — Id. Rab., § 794, § 795. Man, therefore,is the form that comprehends all things.\" — Id. Rob., g 799.The name of God, as Creator of the universe, is, according to the Kabbala, as wehave already had occasion to remark, Cliokmah, Wisdom. Chokmah is the secondsephirah. The kabbalistic conception of Wisdom, the Creator of the worlds,working, as the Second Sephirah, in subordination to the Ancient of days, issupposed to have originated in the following passages of Scripture: —“ The Lord by Wisdom hath founded the earth;By Understanding hath he established the heavens.\"Prov. iii. 19.“The Lord possessed me (Wisdom) in the beginning of his way. Before his works ofold.From eternity was I anointed From the beginning,Before the earth was.While the Abyss {Heb. TTiehom) was not, was I brought forth; While thefountains, heavy with waters, were not as yet.Before the mountains were settled,Before the hills, was I brought forth;While as yet he had not made the earth,Nor the open places, nor the fruitful soil.When he established the heavens, I was there;Picture #66 [images/img_0066.png]59When he set a circle on the face of the deep;When he spread the clouds above;When he strengthened the fountains of the Abyss;When he gave his decree to the sea.That the waters should not pass his commandment;When he laid the foundation of the earth, —Then was I by him as one brought up with him;And I was his delight day by day.Rejoicing always before him,Rejoicing in the perfection of his earth;And my delights were with the children of men.\"Prov. viii. 22-31.Now, since God does all things wisely, and since Wisdom is always the same,God’s method in creation never substantially varies. What men call the unvaryinglaws of nature, are, in reality, nothing in themselves; for they are mereaspects of God’s unvarying manner of action. The sum of these laws, of thesepersisting aspects of the divine action, is the Greek Logos; but this sum is notat all the Hebrew Word, or Wisdom. Wisdom is before its own effects, and beforethe unvarying aspects of its own operations. The Hebrew Word is God himself, asthat spontaneous Divine Wisdom, as that Heavenly Man, that Creator of theheavens and the earth, of whose personal workings the impersonal Greek Logos isthe ideal resultant and record only.Force and Law are two different things. The Force of ' gravitation, forinstance, is the mysterious efficacy by which material things naturally approacheach other. The Law of gravitation, on the other hand, is this : “ The force ofgravitation acts always with intensities inversely proportional to the distanceswhich separate gravitating bodies.” Law determines forms, recurrences ofphenomena, and the nature of evolutions. Every thing thrives, if it thrive at /all, in obedience to the law of its kind. Lily-plants never become transfiguredinto those that bear roses, or into thosePicture #67 [images/img_0067.png]60that bear violets; and neither the seeds of the rose, nor those of the violet,ever give birth to lily-plants. The twig of a plum-tree grafted into apeach-tree is fed by the same soil, air, light, and moisture, which feeds thepeach-twigs that surround it; but the twig of the plum-tree will always remaintrue to the law of its kind, will triumph over the necessities of its meresituation, and will always bear plums, just as it would have done if it hadremained in its parent tree. The bark, fibres, leaves, fruit, of the plumtwig,are always the bark, fibres, leaves, fruit, of the plumtree, and never those ofthe peach-tree.The Hebrew Word is Force. The Greek Word is Law. The Greek philosophers neversuspected their Eternal Logos of possessing personality, and of being a man. TheHebrew Word is a heavenly man, — Adam Kadmon. The attempt to interpret Hebrewmysteries in the light of Greek philosophy has never brought forth any thingother than either nullity or confusion. In matters of high theology, Israel andJavan never understand each other.The Christian religion, Hamitic-Shemitic in its origin, but generally rejectedby the Shemites and Hamites, has become almost exclusively Aryan by adaptation,radical transformation, and adoption. The typical Aryan-Cliristians—theultra-protestants —receive their religion at second-hand ; but they receive itdefectively, since they receive with it neither the key of prophecy, nor thewand of miracles. Many of the original dogmas of Christianity, dogmas akin tothose of the Kabbala, have dropped out of modern theology; and dogmas alien tothe primitive system have been added. It is matter for surprise thatAryan-Christians, living by a borrowed religion,—a religion whose most essentialmysteries are inexplicable from the Aryan standpoint, — should see their wayclear, as they do see it, to taunt the Shemites and Hamites with allegedintellectual, moral, and spiritual inferiority.Picture #68 [images/img_0068.png]61The Christian religion was, when it was first preached, foolishness to theGreeks, and to the Jews a stumblingblock. The Greeks laughed when they firstheard of it. The possibility that the Word should “ become flesh ” was not inthe conditions of their theory. To say that the Eternal Logos had become flesh,was, in the opinion of the philosophers, like saying that the intrinsic natureof the circle had suddenly assumed the form of a square. Christianity presenteditself to the cultivated Greek mind, not as a stumbling-block, but as sheerabsurdity. With the Jews the case was different To men like Saul of Tarsus,thoroughly instructed in the occult theology of the Hebrews, Christianity wasnot foolishness, but, on the contrary, something full of danger to the Jewishstate and religion. The new Christian doctrine, from the standpoint of theoccult theology, was perfectly logical and consistent. There was no defectwhatever in tlie theory. All turned upon a question of historical fact to bedetermined by evidence. The Jews said, “Is it true that Jesus was really anincarnation of the Celestial Wisdom, of the Maker of the worlds, of the Man whois above ? ” Christians of the school of St. Paul answered by affirming theresurrection of Jesus from the dead, and his visible ascension into heaven inthe presence of then surviving witnesses.* The apostle Paul says, —“ Christ was buried, and rose again the third day according to the scriptures;and was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that, he was seen of abovefive hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto thispresent, but some are fallen asleep. After that, he was seen of James; then ofall the apostles. And, last of all, he was seen of me also, as of one born outof due time.f ... If Christ be not risen,* This answer, though very convincing, is, after all. not precisely to thepoint. The fact that Jesus rose from the dead does not suffice to prove, ofitself alone, the fact of his pre-existence in eternity, as the Maker of theworlds.t Paul hadhU theological training under Gamaliel, and under the Mekubbalim. Henever saw Jesns in the flesh, but saw him in a vision, on the way to Damascus,after the resurrection. He was never subjected, as the other apostles had been *to the human influences of the Grand-Master of the Ideal..6Picture #69 [images/img_0069.png]Picture #70 [images/img_0070.png]62then is our preaching vain, and jour faith is also vain. Tea, and we are foundfalse witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised npChrist” — 1 Cor. xv. 4-15.It was with no reminiscence of the Greek doctrine of the Word which he hadlearned at Tarsus, but in the distinct apprehension of a doctrine far moreprofound, — the occult Hebrew doctrine of the Word, — that Paul said (1 Cor. xv.47), “ The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord fromheaven.” It was in the same high presence that he said, respecting the Lord fromheaven, —“ He is the image of the invisible God, the First-bqm of every creatore. For byhim were all things created that arc in heaven, and that are in earth, visibleand invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, orpowers : all things were created by him and for him: and he is before allthings, and by him all things consist.” — Coloss. i 15-17.This enumeration of thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers, and theother salient points of the phraseology, are, all of them, in the highest degreekabbalistic. Perhaps the passage is a lost fragment of the Kabbala, quoted bythe apostle, but with an incidental interpretation from his own point of view.That a man should be raised up who could write as St. Paul wrote is conceivable;but that he should have found communities, scattered all over the Roman empire,ready to receive his letters, and competent to read them understandingly and tofairly appreciate them, is matter for surprise. The fact of his letters being soreceived and appreciated would appear to prove that the characteristic occultdoctrines of the Hebrew theology were widely spread among adepts at the time theapostle wrote.The great schism in the early Church occurred while Paul was still living.Important elements of the kabbalistic doctrine passed, with Paul’sinterpretation and appliPicture #71 [images/img_0071.png]68cation of them, into the Apostolic Church of the Gentiles. Many of theMekubbalim refused, however, to accept Paul’s statement that Jesus is theChrist, the incarnation of the Word. The Kabbala refused to abdicate in thepresence of the new religion. The Jewish tradition, but in its mos^ moderateform, became the inspiration of the Ebionitic Christians; and the Greekdoctrines, associated with other Aryan doctrines from Persia and India,furnished occasion for the rise of the more noted heretical sects.When the Greek theologians gave Japhetic expression to the originalShemitic-Hamitic dogmas of Christianity, which they did in their discourses, andby means of translations from Syriac into Greek, they unwittingly falsified thesystem. When they said and wrote that the Son (the Hebrew Chokmah) was madeflesh, they tacitly meant to say, and were understood to say, that the GreekLogos (the Hebrew Binah, the impersonal Daughter) was made flesh.* Thismisapprehension created, from the beginning, a disastrous confusion in Christiantheology, of which the effects are distinctly visible at the present day.In the Catholic theology, which, upon the whole, has remained logical andconsistent, Binah has become embodied in the Blessed Virgin full of grace, whosepersonality is exclusively human. The Catholic Church departs from the earlyfaith, if it depart from it at all, by excess, and not by defect The CatholicChurch teaches all that there is in Christianity. It is not for us to say thatit teaches nothing more.It has become our fixed conviction, from reflection on the inhering nature ofthe case, from a careful examination of• Chokma 1is Son in respect to the Elder of elders, and Father in respect toindividual men and women: in like manner. Dinah (Understanding) Is Daughter inrespect to the Elder of elders, and Mother in respect to, &c. The Zohar says, “Thou shalt call Wisdom thy Father, and Understanding thy Mother.” And again: “Wisdom is the Father; Understanding is the Mother: and these two are weighed inone Balance, as male and female.”Picture #72 [images/img_0072.png]64the opinions expressed by the different writers of the New Testament, and fromlistening to expositions of the authentic doctrines of the Church, that Paul’stheories are radically and disastrously defective. The general system whichflows from the theory of divine evolutions, and from the affirmation that thepersonality of the second sepjiirah is the personality of Jesus, is ahalf-interpretation of Christianity, and is not at all adequate to the moral andpractical purposes of a sufficient creed. Paul’s system (defective in morality,and in internal evidence of its own truth, rather than in the matter of merelogic) is the system usually adopted by Christians affecting utter andunreasoning orthodoxy, and who receive, as such, their belief without rationalinvestigation. The main practical difficulties of Paul’s system are these : Itis usually held uni ntelligently by its advocates; it is easily learned by itsopponents, who often take its advocates by the flank, and in very unexpectedoccurrences ; it teaches justification by faith without works, that is to say,it makes a substitution of arbitrary justification by the covering-over andnon-counting of sin, in the stead of sanctification through amendment of lifeand the remission of sinfulness; it presents every particular conversion as aspecial miracle; it presents every supposable fact of damnation as having itscause and origin in the foreknowledge and predeterminate counsel of God; itpresents ‘the at-one-ment as consisting, on the one side, in the punishment ofthe innocent, which is an outrage on the moral sentiments, and, on the otherside, in the counting of scoundrels as though they were honest men, which isanother outrage; it confounds man’s reason, by creating an issue between God’sword in nature and Grod’s word in scripture; it presents God as the voluntaryauthor of sin; it naturally awakens hostility to Christianity by calling God’sjustice in question; and it makes atheists among the unconverted. In it, as anexposition of the principlesPicture #73 [images/img_0073.png]65of Christianity by the Kabbala, the Kabbala spoils Christianity, andChristianity spoils the Kabbala.The Pauline doctrine against that of the early Gnostics, and the converse; thedoctrine of St. Augustin against Manichffiism, and the converse; Calvinismagainst Socinianism, and the converse,—are thr*>3 forms of one and the samecontradiction-pregnant. The same motive — the alleged impossibility of a directand immediate intercourse, union, and welding of spirit with matter, and of theinfinite with the finite — which induced the Gnostics and the Manichaeans todeny Christ’s humanity, induces, to-day, the Socinians to deny his divinity.Calvinism refutes Socinianism, and, at the same time, calls it into being, andconsolidates it: Socinianism refutes Calvinism ; and yet, without Calvinism,Socinianism would have no reason for existing. Calvinism is the masculine termof this kabbalistic couple, and' Socinianism is the feminine term. The lofty butpeculiar metaphysical doctrine which is expounded in the Gospel of St. John, andin neither of the other Gospels, is the synthetic resolution of thecontradiction-pregnant presented by the problem of the personality of Jesus.It seems to be generally assumed by readers of the New Testament, that thesublime parts of St. John’s Gospel are addressed exclusively to the religioussentiment. This is an error. The most transcendently spiritual passages of St.John’s Gospel are precisely the parts of the New Testament which are the mostintelligible. This error, and the ordinary natural instinctive antipathy ofspiritually-minded persons to pure metaphysics, have conspired to cause thedoctrine of St. John’s Gospel to remain occult in the Church.The doctrine of the Kabbala and that of the New Testament are neither hostile toeach other, nor yet the same. If it be deemed requisite to find the effectualpoint of contact of the two, we must look for it, not where the school ofSt Paul places it, but in the theory of the Kabbalistic«•Picture #74 [images/img_0074.png]G6Balance. The school of St. John, subsequent both logically and chronologicallyto that of St. Paul, corrects and completes the doctrine of St. Paul. The theoryof Life, as it is expounded by the school of St John, is the transfiguration ofthe kabbalistic theory of the .Balance. St. John’s doctrine carries “its witnessin itself;” for the relations of its parts are perfectly logical, and theessential facts on which it is based may be verified, to every requisite extent,by each believer in his own private experience : “ If any man will to do God’swill, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God.” — John vii. 17.There is nothing new in the morality taught by Jesus. Men were aware of thefact, before Jesus came, that God / is the universal Father. David says (Ps.ciii. 13), “Like as a father pitieth his children, so Jehovah pitieth them thatfear him.” The following passages show plainly that Moses and the prophetsrecognized God as a Father: —“ Do ye thus requite the Lord, 0 foolish people and unwise ? is he not thyFather that hath owned thee ? hath he not made thee and established thee'1—Deut. xxxii. 6. Doubtless thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us: thou, 0 Lord! art our Father; our Redeemer from everlasting is thy name —Isa.lxiii. 16. But now, O Lord ! thou art our Father: we are the clay, and thou ourpotter; and we all are the work of thy hand. — ha. lxiv. 8. Have we not all oneFather ? hath not one God created us * — Mai. ii. 10. Zion said, The Lord hathforsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.. Can a woman forget hersucking-child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb 1 Yea,they may forget; yet will I not forget thee. — Isa. xlix. 14, 15. As one whomhis Mother comforteth, so shall Jehovah comfort you; and ye shall be comfortedin Jerusalem.” — Isa. lxvi. 13.We know that it is written in the New Testament, “ Ye have heard that it hathbeen said (in the law), Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy.” ButJesus never spoke those words. They are inexcusably calumnious.Picture #75 [images/img_0075.png]67Moses says (Exod. xxiii. 4,5), —l“ If chon meet thine enemas ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt bring it backto him again; and if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under hisburthen, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help him/1Solomon says (Prov. xxv. 21,22), —\"If thine enemy be hungry,give him bread to eat; and, if he be thirsty, give himwater to drink: for thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head ” (thou shaltcover him with burning shame),\" and the Lord will reward thee\" (by bringing himto repentance).The following provisions of the Mosaic law were probably in the mind of thewriter of the above-quoted interpolated passage of the New Testament; for we areconvinced that the objectionable words are an interpolation : —“ Thou Bhalt not put forth to thy brother at biting (or interest), — biting ofmoney, biting of victuals, biting of any thing which is susceptible of biting:to a foreigner thou shalt pat forth at biting; but to thy brother thou shalt notput forth at biting.” — Dent, xxiii. 19,20.The modem arbitrary distinctions between interest and usury were unknown toMoses and the prophets. In their view, interest and usury were the same thing.The one and the other were simply that which, in the relation of borrowing andlending, “ biteth like a serpent.” Moses did not believe in the utility ofborrowed capital‘on which interest is paid, or in the expediency of public debtswhich mortgage a whole country to strangers.David says (Ps. xv.),—\"Lord, . . . who shall dwell in thy holy hill! . . .He that lendeth not out his money at biting! ”The precept of “ the Law ” may be thus paraphrased: —Unto foreigners thou shalt lend out thy money at usury;But thou shalt not take interest of thy brother:Picture #76 [images/img_0076.png]68So shall the nations round about thoc be mortgaged unto thee. And thou shalt notbe mortgaged unto them;And thou shalt have dominion over them,And they shall not have dominion over thee.The rich man, who, being in hell, saw Lazarus in Abraham’s bosom, is supposed bythe commentators — probably because no special offence is charged against him —to have been condemned to punishment for lending money to his brethren atbiting, or interest. If the rich man and his relatives had listened effectuallyto Moses and the prophets, they would not have put out their money at interestto any but aliens from the commonwealth of Israel.The difference between the new law, as it is now generally interpreted, and theold law, is this: The Christian, by the new law, may “ bite ” not only Jews andinfidels, but also Christians; while, by the old law, Jew must never \" bite ”Jew.We would like to ask the sentimentalists who accept all the moral teachings ofJesus, deny all the distinctive doctrines of Christianity, calumniate the Hebrewreligion until they suppose they have driven it out of the memory of men, thenassume distinctive Hebrew or Greek doctrines as their own,* and finally callthemselves liberal “ Christians,” what they have in their religion that was notalso in the religion of the prophet Isaiah, or else in that of Socrates andPlato, centuries before the “ Word became flesh.” We shall• Mr. Jacob Norton, a man of very accurate erudition in matters of Hebrew andMasonic literature, has called the writer’s attention to the fact, that theequivalent of the English expression, “ O our Father 1 ” occurs over and overagain in the Hebrew text of the famous “ eighteen prayers ” that are regularlyrepeated three times every day by all pious Jews. Furthermore: the learned•rabbi. Dr. A. Guinsburg, affirms that these same prayers were regularly recitedin the synagogues, and probably in the temple of Jerusalem, long before the timeof Christ. The venerable rabbi says he never heard either the antiquity or theauthenticity of these prayers called in question, and asserts that it may easilybe proved, if necessary, from genuine tradition, and from the internalevidences, that they are as old as he says they are.Picture #77 [images/img_0077.png]probably be obliged to wait some time for an answer. If a man reject the theoryof reminiscence, the doctrine of ideas, and the other characteristic teachingsof Plato, why should he call himself a Platonist ? If a man reject the peculiarfeatures of Christianity which make it to be a special religion, apart fromother religions, why should he call himself a Christian ? There is no questionhere of personal moral character, or of the relative truthfulness of variouscreeds. If a man live by and profess a religion other than Christianity, he isno Christian, even if his religion prove to be better than Christianity. Nothingis fever gained, and often much is lost, in the long-run, by sentimental lying.The distinctive feature of Christianity is the fact — if it be a fact — that “the man Jesus is the Son of the living God with poweb : two natures in oneperson.”As soon as the Pauline interpretation of Christianity had passed to the AryanGentiles, it gave occasion, in many places, for destructive heresies; and themost fatal of them all was the one which affirmed that Jesus was no real man,but a spiritual phantom only, a divine apparition, capable indeed ofcommunicating God’s will to man, but naturally incapable of dying on the cross.What is Christianity without the cross!St John, whose main work was subsequent to that of Paul, passed the whole latterpart of his life in combating the heresy which denies that the \" Son of God ” isa real man. This heresy, which is the formal negation of Socinianism, is,obviously, the effectual equivalent of Socinianism, but in another sphere ofideas. St John says, —H Many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christis come in the flesh. This is a deceiver, and an Antichrist (2 John 7). Everyspirit that confesseth not that Je6us Christ is come in the flesh is not of God.And this is that spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it shouldcome; and even now already is it in the world.\" — 1 John iv. 8.Picture #78 [images/img_0078.png]70It is the denial of Christ’s humanity, not the denial of his divinity, that is,in.John’s estimation, “Antichrist.” To-day, it would seem that it is the denialof his divinity which is “ a deceiver and an Antichrist”We will now do our best to explain St John’s doctrine, first, in modemmetaphysicid language, without illustrations and comparisons; and then,afterwards, symbolically, in the express words which, according to John’sGospel, were spoken by the Master himself.The act of consciousness is the typical act of life; for the life of theconsciousness, or conscious life, is the highest form of life known to man. Theact of consciousness implies a subject and an object Without the subject, thereis no man, no soul, no Ufa Without the object, there is nothing upon which thesoul may live. Life is the interpenetration and synthesis of activitiesproceeding from the external world on the one side, and of activities exerted bythe soul itself on the other. It is the Ego that lives; but the life of the Egois dependent upon, and on one side determined by, that in conjunction with whichit lives. If the soul live in conjunction with the natural world, it will lead anatural and worldly life; the character of the life being determined, on oneside, by the object. If the soul live in conjunction with the spiritual world,it will have its life, on one side, determined by the object, and the life willbe spiritual. Now, men live in communion with other men. If, therefore, a manliving a mere worldly life meet with a man who is living a spiritual life, thelife of the second man may become the objective element of the life of the firstman; and thus the first man may, through the life of the second man, begin tolead a spiritual life. The second man may convert the first one. Life is thesynthesis of the subject and the object, of the soul and that which is not thesoul, of that which is within and that which is without, of liberty andnecessity.Picture #79 [images/img_0079.png]71Plato defines life to be self-originated motion of the soul, and thereforedefines it inadequately,—not altogether wrongly, but inadequately. He says inthe Phsedrus, “No one will fear to affirm that the power of self-motion formsthe essence and the attribute of the soul; for that which receives motion froman exterior cause is not alive, while that which gives motion to itself isalive.” Plato recognizes the principle of spontaneity, and ignores the principleof determination: he recognizes the principle of liberty, and ignores theprinciple of necessity.Life is complex and synthetic. The interpenetration and synthesis of theactivity of the soul with the activity of that which is not the soul, bothactivities meeting in the body, constitute the fact of life. Without the body,nature is without conjunction with the soul, and the soul without conjunctionwith nature; for the body is that special portion of external nature, inpossible conjunction with all other portions of external nature, that is thecounterpart of the soul in the Kabbalistic Balance.The synthetic conjunction, in the body, of the activities of nature and of thesoul, is life.The facts of our intellectual life, if known to us at all, are made known to usin consciousness; and those of our animal life are made known to us by directobservation. But the facts of our vegetative life are made known to us neitherin consciousness nor by direct observation. A man eats consciously, but digestsunconsciously. It is a matter of experience, that the vegetative life of thebody is sustained by food. According to the theory spontaneously adopted by thegreat majority of mankind, food is the object, which, taken into the body, isassimilated to the body by the unconscious action of the soul, and made to be apart of the body. Without food, a man will die; and no food will sustain andnourish a body from which the soul is absent. Dead men neither eat nor digest Afew scientific men, itPicture #80 [images/img_0080.png]72is true, — and, if we understand him rightly, Mr. Spencer is one of theirnumber, — deny that any spontaneous subject, any soul, really exists; but we arespeaking of che common opinion. All reflecting persons may, perhaps, agree thatthe vegetative life of the body consists mainly and essentially in theassimilation of particles from the surrounding elements, and in the renderingback to the. surrounding elements of particles that have formed a portion of thebody.It is lawful for a man, taking the popular opinion as it stands, to speaksymbolically, and to say, “Truth is the food of the soul.” It is also lawful forhim to run the analogy out into its various ramifications, and to offer thecircumstances of the vegetative life of man as illustrations of metaphysicaltruth. This is what Jesus — who, unlike some of the scientific men, teaches thereal existence of the soul — actually does.Jesus represents himself, in St. John’s Gospel, as living a life apart from thatof other men, and one superior to that of other men. He says that God, theFather, is the direct object of his life, and that his life is, therefore,divinehuman : divine on the side of the object, and human on the side of thesubject. He says, —“ Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God: he hath seenthe Father. —John vi. 46. I know him; for I am from him, and he hath sent me.”—Ch. vii. 29.If Jesus saw the Father, and knew him, and if no other man, before Jesus came,had ever seen the Father, or ever known him directly, it follows that the lifeof J esus differed in kind from that of the persons to whom he addressed thewords here quoted. He was God-man and man-God, not, as St. Paul would seem tointimate, by a transfusion of persons, but, on the contrary, by a communion oflife, John the Baptist says,—Picture #81 [images/img_0081.png]78“No man hath aeen God at any time: the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosomof the Father, he hath declared him/1 — John i. 18.Jesus lived, according to the texts, on one side in the Father; bat he livedalso in communion with men. Men, therefore, by making the life of Jesus theobjective element of their own lives, could themselves live, through him, in theFather. He says, —“ As the living Father hath sent me, and I live bt the Father; so he that batethme, even he shall live bt me.—John vi. 57. He that hath seen me hath seen theFather; and how sayest thou, then, Show us the Father ? Believest thou not thatI am in the Father, and the Father in mef ”— Ch. xiv. 9, 10.Here the force of the symbol becomes manifest. It becomes still more manifest inthe following passages: —“ The bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto theworld. —John vi. 83. I am the bread of life: he that oometh to me shall neverhanger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.— Ch. vi. 35. I am thatbread of life. — Ch. vi. 48. I am the living bread which came down from heaven:if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever.”— Ch. vi. 51.It is useless to multiply passages. The key-word to John’s Gospel is this veryword Life. It is the doctrine of John’s Gospel, that man is naturally mortal;that Jesus was naturally immortal because he “ lived by the Father; ” and thatmen obtain immortality by coming, through Christ, to a participation in the lifeof the Father. Jesus says,—“Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life.—John v. 40. He that believethon the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son Mi not seelife. — Ch. iii. 36. Except ye eot the flesh of the Son of man, and drink hisHood, ye have no life in-you. — Ch. vi. 53. Whoso eaieth mg flesh, and drinkethmg Hood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him np at the last day. — Yer. 54.I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he weredead, yet shall ho live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall neverdie. — Ch. xL 25, 26. Be7Picture #82 [images/img_0082.png]74can* I live, ye shall live also. At that day ye shall knpw that I am in myFather, and ye In me, and I in you.\" — Ch. xir. 19, 90.The union of the Son with the Father consisted neither in an assumption on thepart of the Son of the Father’s person, nor yet in an incarnation of theFather’s person in the Son: it consisted in a communion o/lipjr.[“ Pater omnipotens, ©terne Dens: Qui cum unigenito Filio tuo et Spiritu Sancto,unus es Dens, unus es Dominus: non in unius sinyularitate Persona, sed in untusTrinitate substantial What is substance ?

As soon as the meaningof the word substance is rightly apprehended, the theory of the Divine Presencein the sacraments changes its aspect]Jesus was “one” with the Father in the same way that the disciples were “one”with each other, and uowe” with him.

And this is thedamnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather thanlight, because their deeds were evil.” — Ch. iiL 17-19.If we look at the visible Church of Christ as it now stands on the rock, andendeavor to account for its existence by following up, in the fatality of theirrelations, the chain of antecedents and consequents which connect ithistorically with its beginning, we come to Jesus as the first link of thechain; for beyond him no antecedent belonging to the series can be pointed outThe visible Church, the cherubic form of the spiritual Israel, the magical Riverof Life, the terrestrial Eden, the Miracle of the Ages, originated eighteenhundred years ago in the spontaneity of Jesus. The personality of Jesus,ever-present in its operative energies, appears to us to-day, in and through thevisible Church, just as it did to the early disciples, extrahuman andinexplicable.What do we care to-day, any of us, for the learned remarks that judiciouscritics may have to put forward respecting the original intent and applicationof the Messianic prophecies? Is it not competent to the spirit of Adam Eadmon,the spirit of Humanity, the spirit that rules and interprets the ages, tointerpolate, under the words of the prophets, meanings of which the prophetsnever dreamed ? When we hear poetry of like nature and tenor with that which isquoted below chanted in church, we believe every word of it (so long as theorgan is playing), just as the servant-maids and the coal-heavers who sit nearus believe it. When we go out of the church, and hear the noise of the street,and believe no longer, are we any greater, nobler, better, or even wiser, thanwe were while we were insidePicture #84 [images/img_0084.png]76the building, before the altar, and believing? . It is written in the OldTestament, —“ Bat thon, Beth-lehem Ephratah,Though thou be little among the thousands of Judah,Yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me Who shall be ruler in Israel;Whose goings-forth have been from of old, —From the days of eternity.”—Mie. v. 2.“ Jehovah himself shall give you a sign:Behold, a virgin shall conceive,* and bear a son.And shall call his name Immanuel.” — Isa. vii. 14.\" Unto us a child is born;Unto us a son is given:And the government shall be upon his shoulder:And his name Bhail be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God,The Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.” — Isa. ix. 6.The Sejphiroth.— The First Triad.The ten sephiroth are the ten successive steps, or stages, by which, if we maybelieve the Kabbala, the name of the Supreme becomes known to men. Each sephirahis a distinct special name and aspect of the Most High.The Ancient of days (called also the Elder of elders) is the first Sephirah. TheAncient of days is known to the Mekubbalim by many titles. He is called Kether(the Crown); also the Orient (or the Beginning), the Cause of causes, jEhieh,Black Color, Bottomless Depth, the Fear of the Lord, Light Unapproachable, theEternal, the White Head, and the like.The existence of the Ancient of days (as himself) involves, by necessarycontradistinction, the existence of that• Heb.: “ Behold, the young woman hath eoneeived, and shall bear,” &e.Picture #85 [images/img_0085.png]77which is not himself. But, exclusively of the Ancient of days, nothing is. Thatnothing is uncreated; for it stands in the Kahbalistic Balance as thenegation—the necessary correlative counterpart, by way of contradiction — of theAncient of days. That nothing is the aboriginal Abyss. It is written, “The earthwas without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the Abyss.” * Fromthat Abyss all created things were drawn forth. The world is created out ofnothing. In that aboriginal nothing, the eye of the Ancient of days saw, fromthe beginning, all things as existing potentially and without forms; even tocreatures of whom it was already written, that they should one day arraythemselves against their Maker, defy his power, and be forgiven. For the Elderof elders “calleth things that are not as yet as though they actually were.” Theoriginal nothing is the immanent substance of the existing worlds, the uncreatedand persistent root of every thing that is not God. While the creatures existpotentially only, they are real, but not actual: it is not until they arebrought forth into visibility, through being clothed with form, that they becomeboth real and actual Whether existing visibly or invisibly, the substance andground of the creatures, as creatures, is nothing.It is obvious, from the nature of the case, that the Abyss, the potential world,the original nothing, the possibility of things, must be uncreated. Why ? Forthis reason. If God created the original possibility, that creation of theoriginal possibility was itself possible with God; and a new possibility risesup behind the possibility first considered.. This new possibility is a priorcondition requisite to the very being of the possibility first considered. If wetreat this new possibility (which we have found, on the hypothesis that theoriginal possibility was created} to be prior to that• Thehom, the Abyaa.Picture #86 [images/img_0086.png]78original possibility itself), — if we treat this new possibility as we did theother, still another possibility will rise up behind this new possibility; andso on to infinity. If, therefore, the original possibility was created, thatpossibility was by no means original; for it must have been preceded by anotherpossibility, and this last by another; and so on.The possibility of a particular act of creation is a condition logically priorto the creative act itself; for, if the particular creation be impossible, itwill never take place. The possibility is not made to be by the very fact ofcreation; for the particular creation would have remained possible although theactual creation had never taken place. The greater portion of the Abyss, thegreater part of the possibilities of things, have, indeed, not yet beenrealized, and in all probability they never will be. The possibility of an actof creation is, therefore, a condition logically prior to and independent ofthat act itself; and this reasoning applies as well to the first act of creationas to any other. The possibility of creation, the universe in potentia, theAbyss, therefore, existed before the very first act of creation, and is itselfuncreated.This reasoning, though subtle, and apparently verbal, is supposed to be. inreality accurate, logical, and conclusive.The original nothing was, from the beginning, outside of the Elder of elders, —opposite to him, — other than himself. In it the Elder of elders was reflectedas in a mirror. The image of the Elder of elders, eternally reflected in thatnothing which was from the beginning, is the Microprosopus. The Elder of eldersis the Macroprosopus. It is written .in the Zohar, —“ The parts of the Microprosopus ('pDtf T3?T, Zoir-Aphin, the shorter face oraspect) are distributed and clothed according to the forms of the Most HolyAncient of days, hidden in all things.—Id. Rab., § 508. . . . These forms of theMicroprosopus are, therefore, disposed according to the forms of theMacroprosopus Ank-Aphin, the greaterPicture #87 [images/img_0087.png]79face or aspect); and the forms of the Microprosopns are extended here and therein human figure and similitude, in order that the spirit hidden in all parts ofit may be drawn forth. — Id. Rab., } 510.\" The Elder of elders is called Ank-Aphin (long-face, or Macroprosopua); but hewho is outside is called Zoir-Aphin (short-face, or Microprosopus); incontradistinction from the Silent Holy Elder, the Holiest of the holy (who hasno face). And, when the Microprosopns looks back upon the Macroproeopus, allthings in it ore reduced to order, and its face is lengthened while it islooking; but its face is not always long likePicture #88 [images/img_0088.png]that of the Elder of elders. — Id. Rab., $ 54,55. . . . There is no lefthandside to the occult Elder; for, with him, every thing is on the right” —Id. Rab.,} SIIn the above figure, a representation is given of the kabbaii8tic “answering offace to face.”* The superior face denotes that of the non-cognizable Head. “That* This picture may be found in Eliphas Levi1* “ Dogma and Bltnal of TranscendentMagic,” and also in the published “ Rituals ” of some of the very high Masonicdegrees.Picture #89 [images/img_0089.png]80which is below answers to that which is above.” Above is the Macroprosopus;below, the Microprosopus. The picture denotes a special phase and moment of theKabbalistic Balance.It is written in the Zohar, “ The Macroprosopus and the Microprosopus are sodesignated to contradistinguish (rPiapb, le-khlAh) them from the Silen. HolyElder, the Holiest of the holy (who has no name).” [Lc-kbl : according to theopposition; as contradistinguished from.] The word Kdbbala has, therefore, anexoteric and an esoteric signification: used exoterically, it signifies thatwhich is received by tradition; used esoterically, it signifies the weighing inthe Balance, the doctrine of oppositions, of contradistinctions, ofcontradictions-pregnant.The theory of the Kabbala is the ancient theory of emanations, but transformedand idealized. It recognizes no material flux. The Kabbala says expressly, “Thought is the source of all that is.” The evolution of the universe is aprocess of thought, not a flow of matter. It is, in one aspect, a poem; inanother, it is a logical argument. In every aspect, the universe is a work ofart. Reality is adequate to thought; and volition, which is a form of thought,is equivalent to existence. It is written in the Zohar, —“ The Holy Elder (the Macroprosopus) is non-manifest. The Microprosopus iseither manifest or non-manifest: as manifest, it may be written with letters.—Zeniutha, ch. iv. § 1, 2. There are twenty-two occult letters, and twenty-twomanifest letters; and the occult and manifest are weighed over against eachother in the Balance. — Zen.t iv. § 10,11. . . . (That which is above is male;that below, female:) as it is written, 'The sons of God saw the daughters ofmen, that they were fair/ — g 16*“ R. Simon said, All things that I have spoken of the Holiest Elder, and allthat I have spoken of the Microprosopus, all are the same, all are one; andthere is no place here for separation. Blessed be He, and blessed be his Name,for ever and ever. — Id, Sut,f § 240. He and his Name are one. —Id, Sut,, § 354.This is the sum of the doctrine. The Elder of elders is in the Microprosopus.All was; all is; all shall be. Mutation is not, was not, and shall never be.” —Id, Rob,, g 920.Picture #90 [images/img_0090.png]81From the Ancient of days, who is the first sephirah, nine other sephirothproceed, making ten in all \" There are ten sephiroth, not nine of them only;ten, and not eleven.” The procession, from the Ancient of days, of the ninesephijoth, is thus explained7 and illustrated in the Zohar: —“ The Most Holy Ancient One (blessed be his name!) separates himself, and alwaysmore and more. In all things he is separate, yet not fully separate: for allthings cohere in him; and he is in all things, and he is all things. Hepossesses form, and yet he is as though he were formless. He assumes form inorder that he may sustain all things; and yet he is without form, since he isnowhere found. As possessing form, he produces hihx lights, which shine from himout of the form he has; and these lights shine from him, and emit flames, andare spread abroad on all sides like rays scattered from a lofty beacon-fire. Ifany one approaches these rays to examine them severally, he finds nothing butthe single beacon-fire. So also it is with the Most Holy Ancient One. He is thatlofty bCacon-fire which is hidden in all occnltadons. He himself is foundnowhere, save in those rays which are spread abroad, revealed, and hidden. Andthese rays are called the Holy Name; and, because of that Name, all of them areone.” — Id. Sut.f $ 41 to $ 47.\"Thought is the source of all that is.” Thought is the first sephirah, theAncient of days. Thought implies a subject which thinks, and also an objectthought. The thinker and the object thought are weighed over against each otherin the Kabbalistic Balance.God is Intelligent-Cause. He is also self-sufficient; and, as such, he createshimself eternally. As creator, he is the thinker; as created by himself, he ishimself the object thought. He is at once the subject and the object of his ownthought. He is that which eternally creates, that which is eternally created,and the eternal act of creation; that which eternally thinks, that which iseternally thought, and the eternal act of thinking. His essence involvesexistence. He is in eternity, and he exists eternally. The Kabbala says, \"TheAncient of days (blessed be his name l) exists in three heads, which are onehead.”Picture #91 [images/img_0091.png]82The Supreme, as thinking subject, is called, in the Kabbala, Chokmah (Wisdom),and is regarded as male. As himself the object of his own thought, he is calledBinah (Understanding), and is regarded as female. Binah is the Supreme asobjective to himself “ Chokmah is the Father; Binah is the Mother: Chokmah andBinah are weighed in one Balance as male and female.9’ It is written in theZohar, —H The Father and the Mother inhere in the Elder, and are his conformations.—IdSut., { 393. The Father and Mother are produced from the Most Holy Elder, belongto him, and in him cohere. Through them the Microprosopus is produced from theMost Holy Elder, and is united with him.”—§ 397,898.The first three sephiroth are the three constituent elements of the divineself-consciousness. The affirmation of the Supreme as existing in the form ofthe first triad of the sephiroth is an affirmation of the personality of God;for personality is an aspect of consciousness.Before the evolution of Chokmah and Binah, the Supreme was devoid ofself-consciousness (the form of man), and therefore of volition, which is aproduct of personal consciousness: consequently, the first worlds persisted not;for the persisting worlds are a product of God’s volition. It is written, \" Inthe beginning, God created (bora, bare) the heavens and the earth; and the earthwas thohu va bohu (a contingent potentiality of existence, and in a potentialityof existence,—an occultation that was occulted in still another); and darknesswas on the face of the Tkehom (the Abyss).” When the Supreme evolved himselfinto Trinity through becoming self-conscious (we speak here of logical, notchronological, sequence), the worlds passed from double into simple occultation;and the Thehom became a mere potentiality, and no longer a potentiality occultedin another potentiality* And herein is mystery.Picture #92 [images/img_0092.png]83A stream of water that should well forth in the Thehom, the Abyss, would springfrom nowhere, and would flow nowhere: it would have no status in space; it wouldexist in the form of infinitely-attenuated spray, mist, or dew. 1^ however, onthe contrary, that same water should well forth in the world of actuality, uponthe earth, it would meet with obstacles, would wear for itself a channel, andwould become a river, having a certain individuality of its own. So it is withthe fact of personality. A person is a living-subject; but if that subject haveno object, be weighed against nothing whatever in the Kabbalistic Balance, itwill not be truly alive, and will be the mere potentiality of a person.If it be a fountain of light, and not one of water, that streams forth into theThehom, the result will be analogous: the light will illuminate nothing, — forthere is nothing in the Thehom to be illuminated, — and the light itself will beand remain invisible.Combining these two figures, we obtain a phrase that has been famous among theMekubbalim, — “The Dew of Lights.”“ This is that manna which is provided for the just in the world to come. Onthis dew the heavenly saints are fed/*— Id. Rab., § 48, 49. By this dew the deadare raised up in the world to come.” — § 45.The Dew of Lights is the potentiality of the Divine Subject, of the DivinePersonality. This is that “Crystalline Dew” which is mentioned in the Zeniutha.It is written,—“ The non-cognizable Head is framed and prepared (or is to be conceived) afterthe similitude of a skull [Kether] filled with crystalline dew [Chokmah]: thecovering membrane [Binah] of this skull is transparent and closed.”—Zeniutha} i.§ 10.Chokmah is called by many names; as the Word, Firstborn, Will, Jah, Amen, What ?Thought, Eden, and the like.Picture #93 [images/img_0093.png]84Binah is, in like manner, called by many names; as Sister, Wonderful Light,River flowing out of Paradise, Daughter, the House of Wisdom, the hhce of theSun, the Fire consuming itself, and the like.The Sephiroth. — The Second Triad*The worlds were brought forth from potentiality into actuality through thevolition of the Supreme. But what moved the Supreme (who is complete in himselfto whose perfection nothing is lacking), and induced him to create the worlds ?Spontaneous pity moved him, and loving-kindness for the creatures he saw in theAbyss (the Thehom), where they were subsisting potentially only, and without anyactuality at all.Pity or mercy, *JOn (Ohesed), is the fourth sephirah. Sometimes this sephirah isknown also as nbllJ ( Gedulah), greatness, magnificence, generosity. The fourthsephirah is called by many names; as Water, White Fire, White Clothing, El,Abraham, Silver, Michael, the Lion’s Face, and the like.But pity, standing alone, is barren, is virtual only. Pity implies justice asits correlative opposite. Pity and justice, like wisdom and understanding, areweighed against each other in the Eabbalistic Balance as male and female. Theactuality of the one implies the actuality of the other.Justice, 'p'l {Din), is the fifth sephirah. Sometimes this sephirah is knownalso as iTYna ( GibboraJi), rigor, severity. The fifth sephirah is called bymany names; as Elohim, Isaac, Red Color, Red Fire, Gold, the Golden Altar,Gabriel, Metatron, the North, Judgment, Fear, Sanctification, Truth, Merit, andthe like.The synthesis of mercy and justice in the Kabbalistic Balance is Beauty. Beauty,mNSn (Tiphareth), is the sixth sephirah. This sephirah has many names; as. YelPicture #94 [images/img_0094.png]85low and Green Colors, Son, Rising Sun, Shadd&i, High Priest, the World to Come,the Husband of the Church, Holy King, Terrible, and the like.Woman is justice: man is mercy. Marriage, the synthetic union of the two, isTiphareth, — beauty; and marriage is always beautiful when the woman is just tothe man, and the man is magnanimous to the woman. Woman is fatality : man isspontaneity, liberty. Fatality and liberty, the two aspects of human life,naturally contradict each other, deny each other, and exclude each other; butwhen liberty, as against fatality, takes the form of Magnanimity,—the fourthsephirah, — and fatality, as against liberty, takes the form of Justice, — thefifth sephirah, —then Beauty — the sixth sephirah — immediately comes into beingas the sabbath of rest for the two.It will be observed that the figure on the 79th page is in the form of theBlazing Star. The points of the star are represented by the opposing crowns andby the angles of the elbows. The Cubical Stone and the Blazing Star areequivalent symbols: each face of the stone answers to a point of the star.The two sephiroth, Mercy and Rigor, are denoted in the picture by the hairparted in the middle, and “ hanging in equilibrium.” Sometimes Beauty is denotedby the forehead, and sometimes by the beard. All the sephiroth are denoted inthe Balance by parts and adjuncts of the Head only; fo$ it is written, —** The scripture says, * Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years.’ Thisis said of the Ancient of days. What is this ‘work’? Microprosopus.—Id. Rab., §738. Bnt nothing is revealed of the Holy Elder save the head only; for he is theHead of all heads.” — Id. Sut^ §57.We will quote some of the passages of the Zohar in which the sephiroth arespoken of as denoted by the lips, beard, forehead, and the like of theMacroprosopus: —8Picture #95 [images/img_0095.png]86“ The beard hides not the lips, which are red and rosy. As it is written, * Hislips are like roses.’—»Coat. v. IS. Thv lips matter Severity; they matterWiadom, To them pertain good and evil, life and death. — Id. Sut., § 678-680. Inthe book of dissertations of B. Jebha, the elder, it is affirmed and stated thatthe beard of the Macroprosopos begins at the supreme Benignity. And so it iswritten (l Chron. xxix. 11), * Thine, O Lord 1 is the greatness (Gedulah) andthe power (Gibborah) and the beauty (Tipharetk),* Ac. This affirmation iscorrect These things are so, and thus begin.—Id. Sut., § 663,664. The foreheadof the Macroprosopos is called WeD-pleasedness. — Id. Sid., § 87. When it isunveiled, loving-kindness is found in all worlds, and all prayers are accepted,and the face of the Microprosopns is illuminated from above, and all thingsappear in mercy.—§ 90,91. And all judgments are turned aside, and mercy is foundin their stead.—§ 93. Also the Gehenna fire withdraws into its place, andsinners have a respite. — § 94.“ Certainly, so far as the Elder of elders, the White Head, discloses hisforehead, great mercies are found everywhere; but, when that forehead iscovered, the Microprosopns is clothed with unmitigated judgments, and, if it belawful so to speak, mercy becomes judgment. — Id. Bab., § 678680. The foreheadof the Microprosopns is the forehead of the visitation of sinners. When thatforehead is uncovered, there is a rising-up of the judgments of the Lord againstsuch os blush not for their evil works. This forehead is rosy-red; but itbecomes as white as snow whenever the forehead of the Elder of elders isuncovered before it in the hour called the time of loving-kindness for all. —Id. Sut., § 496-499. When the forehead of the Macroprosopus is unveiled, itquenches the fire of the forehead of the Microprosopns while this secondforehead is inspecting the sins of the world that blushes not for its works. Asit is written (Jer. iii. 3), ‘ Thou hast an harlot’s forehead, and refusest tobe ashamed.’ ” — Id. Bab., § 592, 593.*Pity, mercy, magnanimity, generosity, — the fourth sephirah, — is active,spontaneous, and free. Commiseration, a human passion which (because it is apassion) counts not among the sephiroth, is responsive and female, or subsistsin instinctive re-action and communication, and therefore belongs to the orderof fatality. Pity is distinctively human. Dumb animals sometimes commiserateeach other; but no dumb animal ever yet experienced the sentiment of spontaneouspity.Picture #96 [images/img_0096.png]87Pity belongs to the soul: commiseration and compassion belong to the body. Pityis indefectible; but commiseration and compassion turn easily into jealousy,envy, and hatred. The same principle of instinctlre sympathy which impels us toaid those who, through suffering, are more unhappy than we are, causes us toconspire against all superiority that imparts to others a happiness we do notpossess. We never envy the trees for their tallness; but we envy the naturaladvantages of other men: this is because we live in sympathetic relations ofaction and re-action with men; while, between ourselves and the trees, no realsocial bond exists.The soul and the body, the spiritual man and the animal man, liberty andfatality, are weighed over against each other in the Kabbalistic Balance. Theapostle Paul says, —“ The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh ; andthese are contrary the one to the other. — Gal. v. 17. They that are accordingto the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; and they that are according to thespirit, the things of the spirit: for to be carnallyminded is death; but to bespiritually-minded is life and peace. — Rom. viii. 5, 6. I delight in the law ofGod after the inward man; but I see another law in my members warring againstthe law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is inmy members.” * — Rom. viL 22, 23.The first experience, by an individual man, of the senti- 1 ment of magnanimousmercy, is usually coincident with his first? act of real and effectualself-consciousness; and it is through an act of consciousness that the warbetween the law of the mind and the law of the members is brought to an end, andreplaced by peace. Pitiless men are men who have not yet outgrown the thraldomof mere animal exist* St. Paul is very quick to disoern a contradiction in the Balance; but hefrequently fella to perceive the synthesis. It is for this reason that hiswritings, though powerful to produoe conviction of sin, are less potent thanthose of St. John in effecting conversions.Picture #97 [images/img_0097.png]88exice; men who have, in fact, a certain consciousness, such as the animals have,but, as yet, know nothing <LC that spiritual consciousness of which we havespoken. The first experience of the sentiment of spontaneous pity marks acritical epoch in the history of individual men. It is the .first round in theladder of spiritual religion. St. Paul places charity—not alms-giving, but pity,mercy, generosity — above faith and hope. He says, “ Though I bestow all mygoods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have notcharity, it profiteth me nothing.” And again: “ And now abideth faith, hope,charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.” The day and thehour in which an individual man first knows the sentiment of true charity isalways remembered. No man was ever born again (and no people was ever bom again)without being consciously aware of the spiritual transformation, and withoutretaining a distinct recollection of the event.The Sephiroth.— The Third Triad.The first triad — thought, wisdom, understanding — is intellectual. The secondtriad — mercy, justice, beauty — is moral and spiritual. The third triad isphysical, or dynamic.The seventh sephirah, the first term of the physical or dynamic triad, is callednot only 71X3 (Netseeh, Victory), but also Jehovah Sabaoth, Eternity, Moses,Jachin (or the name of the right-hand column in the porch of Solomon’s temple),&c. Let us stop with Jachin. The word Jachin signifies “ Force thatestablishes.” Jachin is energy.The eighth sephirah, the second term in the physical triad, or nn (Hod, Glory),is also called Elohim Sabaoth, Aaron, King’s Daughter, the Old Serpent, Boaz (orthe name of the left-hand column in the porch of Solomon’sPicture #98 [images/img_0098.png]temple), &c. Let us stop this time with Boaz. The word Boaz signifies “ Strengthof endurance.” Boos is strength.Netsech and Hod, Victory and Glory, Jachin and Boaz, are energy and strength.The Kabbala says, —“By Netsech and Hod (Victory and Glory) farce is multiplied. All powers born inthe universe flow from these two. They are called the armies of the Eternal.”We may illustrate the weighing of these two correlatives over against each otherin the Kabbalistic Balance by instancing the natural working of any materialmachine; of a locomotive steam-engine, for example. If the steam be not utilizedin the locomotive, but is allowed to disseminate itself in space, it will spreaditself on every side, exert itself nowhere, and will fail to reveal itself asforce. On the other hand, so long as the machine is unactuated by the steam, thematerials of which it is composed will remain inert, and no motion will beoriginated. The true workingpower of a locomotive steam-engine is a syntheticresult, a joint product of the energy (Jachin) furnished by the steam, and ofthe resisting strength (Boaz) of the materials entering into the composition ofthe machine.The ninth sephirah, mO'' (Jesod, Foundation), is the synthesis of Jachin andBoaz, of energy and strength: it is working-power.*The third triad, the physical or dynamic triad, is, therefore, energy, strength,working-power. The Kabbala says (Idra jRabba, § 600), “ The forehead of theMicroprosopus is Netsech (Victory).” We suspect that Netsech and Hod, Jachin andBoaz, energy and strength, are denoted by the* The usefhl effect, or “ working-power,” of a machine, is the fraction thatexpresses the amount of work performed as compared with the power applied. Thepower applied Is expressed by unity. Thus, if the machine perform two-thirds ofthe work applied to it, one-third of the power applied is lost by friction, andtwo-thirds is the useful effect of the machine. — Bober’s MePicture #99 [images/img_0099.png]90two eyes of the Microprosopus; but we have never yet been able to find theexpress passage of the Zohar that would confirm our suspicion. We do not fullyunderstand the following extracts, but give them, nevertheless, in the hope thatthe reader may be able to make out their meaning: —“ In the Microprosopus there is a right eye and a left eye; and these two are ofdiverse colors. But the eye of the Macroprosopns is not at all on the left; forboth eyes are one eye, and both are on the right. For this reason, they are nottwo eyes, but one eye. And this eye, which is the eye of observations, is alwaysopen; but the eyes of the Microprosopus are not always open, and they haveeyelids to protect them.—Id. Rab.f § 149-152.“ The children of Israel said (Exod. xvii. 7), ‘Is the Lord among us, or not? *This question makes a distinction between the Microprosopus, who is calledTetragramm&ton (and is with men), and the Macroprosopus, who is called (NonEns).—Id. Rob., § 83.“It is written (P$. xliv. 24), * Awake! why sleepest thou, O Lord ? * And again(2 Kings xix. 16), ‘Open, Lord, thine eyes, and see/ The eye of theMacroprosopus is always opened for good; but sometimes the eyes of theMicroprosopus are opened for evil. Woe to him upon whom those eyes so open thatthey are seen mixed with red, and with the redness glaring as an adversary uponhim who behqlds it 1 Who shall escape from those eyes ? — Id. Rab., § 153-155.“ The eyes of the White Head are not like other eyes; for they have neithereyelids nor eyebrows over them.—Id. Rab., § 112. Now, whatsoever worketh throughmercy needs neither a covering upon the eye, nor yet eyebrows; much less doesthe White Head require eyelids and eyebrows. — Id. Rab., § 115. For the WhiteHead sleeps never, and requires no protection for its eyes. — Id. Rab., § 113.Nothing is over the eye of the White Head to protect it; for itself protects allthings, and watches all things; and, by reason of the inspection of this eye,all things consist. If this eye should be shut for a single instant, nothingwhatever would subsist. — Id. Rab., § 135,136. If the superior eye should notlook on the inferior eye, the world would cease to be.—Id. Rab., § 142.“ The black color in the eyes of the Microprosopus is like that of die Stonewhich comes forth out of the Abyss into the great sea once in a thousand years.• When that Stone appears, there are storms and tempests in the sea, and thevoice of the waves is lifted up; and that voice is heard by the great fish, whois Leviathan.—Id. Rab., § 632, 633.Picture #100 [images/img_0100.png]91“ When sins are multiplied in the world, and the Sanctuary is profaned; when themale dwells for from the female; when the robust Serpent begins to raise himselfup,—woe to the world that nourishes itself from the then existing justice! Inthose days, executioners and tormentors are given to the world, and many justmen are taken out of it. Why f Because the male is separated from the female,—justice from judgment.”—Id. Sut., § 867-869.The ninth sephirah is called by many names; as the Covenant of the Lord, theCovenant of Circumcision, the Member of the Covenant, El Chai, the RedeemingAngel, the Fountain of the Water of Life, the Tree of Knowledge of Good andEvil, Mount Zion, Leviathan, the Lord upon the Ark of the Covenant, the Columnof Peace, Time, the Gate of Tears, and the like.The Sephiroth. — MatroneL.The tenth sephirah, mabtt (Melcutk, Royalty), is known by many names, amongwhich the following may be mentioned : the Wife of the Microprosopus, the Earth,the Moon, the End, the Spouse, the Church of Israel, the Virgin of Israel, theHouse of David, the Temple of the King, the Ark of the Covenant, the CopingStone, Shechinah, the Book of Life, and the like. The upper part of this wife ofthe Microprosopus is called Leah, the wife of Israel: the lower part is calledRachel, the wife of Jacob. Melcuth, or Matrona, is actuality. Things that existin the first nine sephiroth only, are potential, invisible, and have nosubsistence outside of the world of pure emanation. Things that exist in all ofthe ten sephiroth are actual and visible. Matrona lends visibility and actualityto that which, without her aid, would exist virtually only.We will explain the nature of this tenth sephirah, not in our own words, whichmight prove inadequate, but in the words of the Idra Suta itself: —Picture #101 [images/img_0101.png]92“ The Microprosopns is formed in the analogy of man; and in him the dispositionof the sexes, as male and female, begins at the back. —§ 945. For, in one andthe same body, this man (the Mtcroprosopus) is both mole and female. — § 949.Thus the Microprosopns is a man and a woman, who adhere to each other by theirbacks; haying four arms and four legs (two of each in front belonging to theman, and two behind belonging to the woman). — § 997. The female head, which isat the back of the mole head, is completely hidden under the hair of theMicroprosopus (this hair senring as a thick veil).”—§ 948.In Plato’s dialogue of the “Banquet,” Socrates describes the first men as beingendowed, each of them, with four arms, four legs, two faces, &c. It was a commonbelief, in the times of remote antiquity, that the first men were createdmale-female.The masculine term of a contradiction-pregnant is impulsive and initiative: thefeminine term is responsive and resistant. If these two are conjoined, back toback, so that they face away from each other, the lines of their actions will bein opposite directions, and the two terms will reciprocally annul each other.This is the equilibrium of negation and living-death. Now, since the happinessof every creature is in the exercise of its natural activities, the completeequilibrium of negation between two living creatures is nothing other than theperfected unhappiness, the entire misery, of both of them. In such equilibrium,each annuls every faculty, capacity, and activity of the other. When, however,the two terms are brought, on the contrary, face to face, each faculty orcapacity of the one gives the means and the occasion for the development of acorrelative faculty or capacity in the other; and then the equilibrium ofsynthesis takes the place of the equilibrium of reciprocal negation, andhappiness takes the place of misery. Actions determined by imperfect equilibriumof negation are usually half-actions,—each one contradicting its antecedent andits consequent, like the strokes of a pendulum:Picture #102 [images/img_0102.png]93every one of them involves disorder and suffering. An imperfect equilibrium ofsynthesis is, on the contrary, a condition of progressive improvement ordeterioration. Every man carries on his back the burthen of the fatality whichinheres in his own nature. When he brings that burthen to the front, byobtaining a distinct understanding of it, and by deliberately accepting himselffor better or worse, the fatality of his nature becomes to him a basis ofactuality, on which he may build up the structure of his own destiny. Evil isincompleteness, especially incompleteness of action. None but men of integrityare happy. It is only by integrity of action that men become whole. Holiness iswholeness, integrity: wilful lack of integrity is sin.It is the doctrine of the Kabbala, that the woman, ob originally conjoined withthe man, back to back, in one complex person, is necessarily evil; becausemisplaced, if for no other reason. When the man and the woman are separated fromeach other, the woman ceases to be evil. The woman becomes positively good assoon as she is brought into communication, face to face, with the man. The IdraSuta says, —“ The voice of the woman (as conjoined back to back with the man), turpitude;the hair of this woman, turpitude; the legs of this woman, turpitude ; the handsof this woman, turpitude; the feet of this woman,, turpitude. — § 965. When themale and female elements were to be. separated, an ecstatic (magnetic) trancefell upon the Microprosopus, and the female part was severed from his back, andhidden until the time when she was to be brought to the male. — § 1028.Meanwhile malignant spirits, authors of disorder, were coming into being: but,before they were finished, Matrons came in her true form, and sat down beforethem, and the creation of them ceased, so that they were not finished; becausethe Matron sat down with the Holy King (the sixth sephirah), and associated withhim face to face.” — § 1035, 1036.We learn from the first chapter of Genesis, that Adam was made, on the sixth dayof the creation, not as a single person or os a single pair, but as a collectivemultitude ofPicture #103 [images/img_0103.png]94individuals. It is written, “ In the image of God created he him; male andfemale created he them. And God blessed them, and said unto them” &c. TheKabbala says that each Adamic individual was male-female, composed of a man anda woman conjoined back to back, and therefore incapable of associating with eachother. It was in this fact of the non-association of the man and the woman thatAdam’s original “loneliness” consisted.At the end of the sixth day, “ God saw every thing he had made ; and, behold, itwas very good,?' But a change took place on the sabbath of rest; for, fartheron, we read (ch. ii. 18), \"The Lord God said, It is not good that Adam should bealone” That which is not good is evil. Evil was therefore in the world beforeEve ate the apple; yea, before Eve existed as a separated person. And it was asa remedy for already existing evil that the original Adam was split lengthwise,along the part where the back now is, and made to be trfit (Ish, man) and STOfct(Ishah, woman). The Idra Babba says, —“ When the Elder of elders wills to separate the male and female elements, hecauses an ecstasy to fall upon the Microprosopns, and severs the woman from hisback. He then completes all her conformations, and hides her until the day inwhich she is to be brought to the male. And this is what is written (Gen. ii.21), ‘ And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam/ ” &c. —§1026-1030.B. Simon says, —“ In no day of my life have I omitted the three feasts; and, on account of them,I had no occasion to fast on the sabbath days. I had no occasion to fast onother days, much less on the sabbath ,* for whoso correctly conducts himselfrespecting those three feasts is an adept in perfect truth. The first feast isMatrona (the tenth sephirah); the second is the Holy King (the sixth sephirah);and the third is the Most Holy Elder, hidden in all occultations (the firstsephirah).” ** The ending of the Lord’s Prayer, as it is printed in the Protestant Bibles,—“For thine is the kingdom (Royalty. Matrona). and the power (Netsech. theseventh sephirah), and the glory (Hod, the eighth sephirah),”—is distinctlykabbalistic, and possibly an interpolation of some early commentator: it isneither printed In the Catholic Bibles, nor sung in the Catholic churches.Picture #104 [images/img_0104.png]Picture #105 [images/img_0105.png]95Matrona, as separated from the Microprosopus, is represented in the emblematicpicture by the small conical figure at the bottom, beneath the band.It now devolves upon us to explain the signification of the serpent which formsthe framing of the picture. This serpent represents the force of fatality, andholds his tail in his mouth to denote eternity and the eternally-recurringcirculation of antecedents and consequents. It is written in the Zeniutha: —“ The vehemency (the realm of Matrona) was real, but within the limitations ofthe formlessness and emptiness and darkness that were on the face of the Abyss,and thus only. Excavation of excavations under the form of a serpent, farextended here and there. His toil is in his head. (With him, the ending is atthe beginning; for he holds his tail in his mouth, and forms a circle.) Hecarries his head around the back (of Matrona). He is fall of wrath, andobserves. He is hidden and revealed in one of the thousand shorter days (in oneof the numerar turns of the Microprosopus). He was changed in his slaying, andcame forth other, and castrate. As it is written (Ps. lxxiv. 13), ‘Thou breakestthe heads of the dragons in the waters/ Two heads there were; but one onlyremains.” — Ch. i. § 23-31.The Ten Sephiroth.The tabular list of the ten sephiroth, their names being given in plain English,is as follows: —(1) Thought.(3) Understanding. (2) Wisdom.(5) Justice.(4) Mercy.(6) Beauty.(8) Strength. (7) Energy.(9) Working-Power.(10) Actuality.Picture #106 [images/img_0106.png]Energy, Mercy, and Wisdom are the right-hand column, the pillar of Jachin, andthe three aspects of the masculine principle.Strength, Justice, and Understanding are the left-hand column, the pillar ofBoat, and the three aspects of the feminine principle.TJie synthetic sephiroth, four in number, Actuality, Work.ing-Power, Beauty, andThought, form the famous middle column, which is known as a Tree of Life.In the Greater Assembly, the companions were so seated that they became anemblematic figure of the three columns of the sephiroth. We read in the IdraRabba, —“ R. Simon said to the companions. How long shall we remain sitting here as asole column ? (or remain unorganized.) — § 1. Then the companions that werebefore R. Simon were numbered; and there were found present ft. Eliezar, who wasR. Simon's son; R. Abba; R. Jehudoh; R. Jose, son of Jacob; R. Isaac; R.Chiskia, son of Raf; R. Ckija; R. Jose; and R. Jesa. (Nine in all, and,including R. Simon, ten, — the number of the sephiroth.) —$ 7. So they gavetheir hands to R. Simon, and raised their fingers on high (they made the signs),and then entered into the field, and sat down among the trees (in the valleythat stretches due E. and W. under the canopy of heaven). — § R* Simon called R.Eliezar, his son, and directed him to sit down before him, with R. Abba on theopposite side. And he said, We are now a type of all things: thus far thecolumns are made firm. — § 13. . . . Before the companions went out of thisfield, three of them died,—R. Jose, R. Chiskia, and R. Jesa. [Ten went in, andonly seven came out]\"The companions were seated in the relative positions indicated by the figure inthe margin. R. Simon 1, sat in the first place (that of the Crown), and the 3*2.serving-brother in the tenth place (that of Matrona, Royalty). The beginning wasin the ending:1 was 10; for he who was master of them all was also the servant of them all.They sat as three triads of triads, with an appendix (10); and the appendix wasthe sabbath of rest for them all. R.Simon sat facing the companions, and the compan- 10*&. 4*6.8. 7.0.Picture #107 [images/img_0107.png]S7ions sat facing It. Simon. To show that the three triads were one triad, we drawa diagonal line from 2 to 8, and that line will pass through 6: that is to say,in order to form one triad of the three triads, we take the subjective term ofthe intellectual triad, or 2, Wisdom, as male; the objective term of thephysical triad, or 8, Strengtly as female; and the synthetic term of the moraland synthetic triad, or 6, Beauty, as the junction of the two, — and weobtainthe formula, —WISDOM, STRENGTH, AND BEAUTY;a formula not unknown to such as know the acacia.If we bring down the first triad (1, 2, and 3) so that it shall becomeinterlaced with the second triad, the two will form a Blazing Star, resting onits lower point, which is 6, Beauty. The first six sephiroth are the six pointsof the Blazing Star. On some occasions, the middle column is regarded as endingat 6, Beauty, and as bearing the Blazing Star for its ornamented capital; or,which is the same thing, as bearing the Cubical Stone. The middle column, asending with Beauty, and as bearing the Cubical Stone, is called the Column ofBeauty. It is also called the short column, because it comprises in its shaftthe sephiroth 10, 9, and 6, and nothing higher; and the twisted column, becauseit is the synthesis of Jachin and Boaz, inclining first towards the one, andthen towards the other, so. as to» be twisted as well as short. To denote itsperfection, and spotlessness, it is said to be made of clear white marble.By the explanation pf them in the light of the sephiroth (numerations orpowers), which are intelligible principles, the rttrin (Tholodoth, lists ofgenerations) mentioned in the Bereshith become available for the forecasting ofthe* destinies of nations, churches, and other human institutions ; for thetholodoth give, in their serial order, the successive*9Picture #108 [images/img_0108.png]98steps of the development of principles embodied in social organizations. We willillustrate this matter by examples. If we study the existing situation ofFrance, and remember the recent consecutive steps by which she became what shenow is, we obtain several characteristic terms of a special series. We may thenlook into the Bereshith to hud that special series. Applying the existingsituation of France to the term in the series of the Bereshith to which itcorresponds, we are furnished, in the next term of the series of the Bereshith,with an indication of the organic posture which France will next assume. Throughthis process we may obtain results characterized by a very notable degree ofaccuracy. The present writer has not qualified himself by careful practice ofthis method, to prophesy the future of the French nation. He will state,however, for the satisfaction of the readar, that there is an extant kabbalisticprophecy, grounded on principles substantially identical with those herementioned, that promises, for the month of November, 1S79. the establishment ofa universal empire, under the inspiration of France; France to be subjected,before 1S79. to a process analogous with* that of natural death and spiritualresurrection. This empire will be at once political and religious; will befounded on the principle of universal peace, and on a rational solution of thequestions (such as those of property and labor, of women's rights, and the like!which now agitate so^ety. It will hold the \"keys of the East/* and will last 854years and 4 months without material alteration. We giTe this prophecy for whatit is worth. We disapprove generally, and on principle, all prophecies thatspecify \"times and hours.\"The names mentioned by the Bereshith in the several lists of the generations arenot at all names of men. but are names of phases of organic development. AHthese names are sxgui ucant in Hebrew. For example, the namePicture #109 [images/img_0109.png]99Cain signifies possession, property.* The name Abel signifies vacuity,emptiness, and, in contradistinction from that Of Cain, non-possession,pauperism.f The murder of Abel by Cain is the subordination of capital by labor,and the consequent destruction of capital; for in the peculiar phase ofprimitive socialism denoted by the family of Cain, and whose beginning, course,and ending were known by authentic tradition to the writers of the Bereshith, itwas the laborer who was the proprietor, and it was the capitalist who lived onthe crumbs that fell from the laborer's table. Cain, the proprietor, was himselfa tiller of the soil, and his children were the inventors of the mechanic arts.Abel, on the other hand, was a priest; and the priesthood, in the early days,comprised all professional men who did not work with their hands, and allgeneral directors of industry. When Cain slew Abel, he rendered the socialsynthesis impossible : he destroyed that which had been created to make him,Cain, rich. Seth signifies stability, basis, and, in the social sphere, order.tSeth is despotism — is the political and social structure that was built up, asit respects its chief corner-stone, upon the dead body of the pauper Abel.§Adam was never “perfect in his generations: ” he never walked truly with theElohim. At first, Cain and Abel were in the earth, without Seth; and,afterwards, Cain and Seth were in it, without Abel. Always one whole side of themystical triangle was lacking. It became necessary,* And Adam knew Ere his wife; and she conceived, and bare *pp (Kin, or Cain,ao^uisMon); and she said, VP3p (JTen-lthi, I have acquired) a man with Jehovah.— Oen. lv. 1.t bnn: He-bel, empty breath, vanity.$ And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name niZ5(Sheth, appointed, founded); because God has appointed to me, she said ShethAi),another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.—Oen. iv 25.| Seth and Satan are different forms of the same word.Picture #110 [images/img_0110.png]100therefore, in the plan of Divine Providence, that the primitive humanity shouldhe drowned out.Noah was “ a just man, and perfect in his generations; and Noah walked with theElohim. And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japhet.” Ham is the new Cain,and Japhet is the new Abel.The times have changed. To-day it is Abel that slays Cain, capital that robslabor. Seth reigns to-day, as he did before the flood; but he founds hissovereignty to-day, not upon the tyranny of labor, but upon the tyranny ofcapital.The list of the generations from Adam to Lamecli — Adam, Cain, Enoch, Irad,Mehujael, Methusael, Lamecli — gives a perfect series of seven terms. Lameclilived 777 years. “All the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and sevenyears; and he died.” The generations from Seth to Noah, including Seth and Noah,give a perfect series of nine terms, or a triad of triads.The numbers three, seven, and nine, are holy numbers.The generations of Japhet, from Gomer to Tiras, form a regular series of seventerms. The generations of Ham, from Cush (Asiatic Ethiopia) to Nimrod (Babylon),give a series of seven terms. The generations of Ham, through Misraim (Egypt) toPhilistim, give a triad of triads.Matthew says (chap. i. ver. 17), “All the generations from Abraham to David arefourteen (2 X 7) generations; and from David unto the carrying-away into Babylonare fourteen (2 X 7) generations; and from the carrying-away into Babylon untoChrist are fourteen (2 X 7) generations.” There were in all, therefore, fromAbraham to Christ, fortytwo (6 X 7) generations. This summing-up agrees neitherwith Matthew’s own list of names, nor with the Old-Testament record; but itshows the influence, upon the evangelist’s mind, of the Old-Testament philosophyof numbers. If we take the list given by Luke, and count from Christ, throughJoseph, to Isaac, we find fifty-four (6 X 9) generPicture #111 [images/img_0111.png]101ations. Adding to these six series of nines the series of nines from Abraham,through Arphaxad, to Shem, and the series of nines from Noah, through Seth, toAdam, we have just eight series of nines. According to Luke, therefore, Jesu3was bom at the end of the eighth epoch of nines, in a grand logical series ofnines, or triad of triads, commencing at the foundation of human society.According to Matthew, he was born at the end of the sixth series of sevens, in agrand logical series of sevens, commencing with Abraham.We had occasion to mention, a moment ago, but without indorsing them, certainprophetic intimations respecting the destinies of France, and the establishment,in the year 1879, of a universal empire. We have no exact knowledge of theprocess, in its details, by which the special results were obtained, but areinformed that the prophecy is grounded, generally, on the interpretation of aSabsean series of 7’s, not given in the Bereshith, or given in it, if at all,under some disguised form. The series is as follows: 1. Saturn; 2. Venus; 3.Jupiter; 4. Mercury; 5. Mars; 6. Luna; 7. Sol: which is the series, but readbackward, of the planets that govern the characteristics, and the order ofsuccession, of the seven days of the week; for Saturday is Saturn’s day, Fridayis Venus’s (or Friga’s) day, Thursday is Jupiter’s (or Thor’s) day; and so on.The prophecy in question turns, like other prophecies of similar nature, on theobserved fact, that history continually repeats itself; going through onecompleted revolution of events after another, each revolution being thereproduction, not by the way of identity, but by the way of analogy, of therevolutions that preceded it. Human evolutions take effect in upward spiralmovements, and in ever-recurring circles that rise continually one aboveanother, as circles succeed each other in the winding stairways on the outsideof the terraced, mound-shaped temples of remote antiquity, e*Picture #112 [images/img_0112.png]102It is the serpent, — the order of fatality which is without admixture ofliberty, — not human history, that gnaws its own tail, and reproduces itself inever-recurring identical circles. Human history repeats itself, but always onhigher and higher planes.The true religion that exists now, always has existed, and always will exist,among men: but it has presented itself, in ever-recurring circles, under higherand higher forms; and men have interpreted it differently, according to theirvarying intellectual and moral capacities, and according to the progressivespirit of the different ages. Christ is the Lamb that was slain from thefoundation of the world. No true religious institution is ever abolished by thenew institution that replaces it; for the new institution is the old institutionitself, but transfigured and glorified. Christianity is the rejuvenation andglorification of the Hebrew religion; just as the Hebrew religion was thetransfiguration and rejuvenation of the Hamitic religions which preceded it, andhad their seats in Egypt and Babylon. Christianity came to fulfil the law andthe prophets, not to destroy them. An approaching rejuvenation of the Christianreligion is clearly foretold in the New Testament. The second coming of Jesus,and his reign of a thousand years upon the earth, are written beforehand withletters of light in the books of the Christian dispensation. The prophecies ofthe Old Testament, foretelling the end of the Jewish Church and theestablishment of a new one, are darkness itself when compared with the promisesof glory contained in the Apocalypse of St. John.If the above-sketched theory be valid, the destinies of the Christian Churchwill be a transformed analogical reproduction, point for point, of the destiniesof the Hebrew Church ; just as the destinies of the Hebrew (or Shemitic) Churchwere an analogical reproduction, point for point, of the destinies of theHamitic Church which preceded it. TraPicture #113 [images/img_0113.png]103cing the analogies, comparing them, and verifying the accuracy of their sequencein the order of the series, we find ourselves—or, at the least, we appear tofind ourselves : who knows ? — to he living in a period analogically resemblingthe times just preceding the Jewish captivity. We are to look, therefore, forthe appearance, in the immediate future, of a transfigured Nebuchadnezzar at thehead of a transfigured Chaldean empire, and for an approaching captivity of theChurch in some transfigured Babylon; the Church to be delivered in due time fromcaptivity, and restored to its former seat (but shorn of its initiative) by sometransfigured Cyrus at the head of an army of transfigured Medes and Persians.This same series of the seven planets, read, not backward, but forward, in thedirect order of the days of the week, is evil and disastrous; for its progressis not then upward and onward, but distinctly downward. In it every planet(except Sol, who stands always in the seventh place, or in the house ofredemption) is afflicted, and sheds deleterious influence.This series of evil begins with Luna, whose portrait is given in the margin.*The picture represents the boat of the moon, with the “ Torch-bearer ” sailingin it, under the rays of the detestable inverted five-pointed star. The star isnot before the* T^e pictures here reproduced may be found In the books of Eliphaz Levi. Theywere communicated to the writer, with several others of like character, by thatenthusiastic student of kabbalistic Masonry, the Hon. Charles Levi Woodbury. TheLatin of the inscriptions, and especially the bad Latin of some of them, andseveral other indications, lead us to believe that the pictures have come downto us with many supposed improvements. The writer is alone responsible for theexplanations given in the text: no such explanations came with the pictures ashe received them.Picture #114 [images/img_0114.png]Picture #115 [images/img_0115.png]104figure, to serve, detestable tbough it be, as an ideal of life and conduct, butis vertically above it, as an unseen compressive power. The wings denoteinitiative faculty. The “ Torch-bearer ” is a law to himself: he follows noideal, but carries his own incendiary light. Obstinate, suspicious, andself-sufficient, be dreads nothing so much as the possibility that he mayconvict himself, before witnesses, of lack of almighty power. Utterly selfish,and acting always on the maxim, “ Self-preservation is the first law of nature,”he passes like water, and without noticing the transitions, from one iniquity toanother, and wanes and waxes and changes as the moon waxes and changes ; for itis under the moon’s malign aspect that this lunatic lives and moves. He isignorant of himself, but knows darkly the things that are not himself, andcalumniates them. In all things he is perverse.When many “ Torch-bearers ” are placed in the same field of action, they formself-interested cliques and rings that come into antagonism with each other. Allof them acknowledging that “ might makes right,” supremacy naturally gravitatesinto the hands of violent desperadoes, and the weaker parties become fags andslaves of the stronger. The portrait of “Nembroud,” the typical desperado, willbe found on the opposite page.* He bears the crown, to denote his authority; andthe sword, to denote the source of his authority. This typical king of spadesbears also a shield, with a device on it, which is the Tower of Babel; and thisdevice denotes the ultimate futility of all his undertakings.The fags and slaves of Nembroud learn, in the experience of their abjectcondition, the vices that are appropriate to* Franoe was in the hands of lunatics when Nembroud-Bonaparte throttled herj wespeak here of the great Napoleon, not the little one. The lesser 'Bonaparte wasnot Nembroud, but Acliara, whose portrait will be given a little farther on.Picture #116 [images/img_0116.png]105Picture #117 [images/img_0117.png]fags and slaves. They become reticent, forecasting, treacherous, and cunning;and the distinct consciousness of their own inherent villany forces itself uponthem. Through the fact of this consciousness the star of their villany passesfrom its occult position overhead, and places itself in front as an accepted •ideal of life and conduct.They were knaves before they were fags and slaves; but, as expert fags andslaves, they become conscious and politic knaves.The portrait of “Tharthac,” the typical politic knave, is given below, in themargin.When Baron Nembroud establishes his power with a high hand, the serf Tharthacescapes to some free city, sets up a banking-house, and ruins Nembroud bylending him money at usurious rates of interest on securities deposited in thefree city.For Nembroud cannot carry on his pillaging expeditions without that veryassistance of Tharthac which ruins him, Nembroud: therefore Nembroud detestsTharthac. Genuine nobles and aristocrats always hate successful business-men whodeal in money. But Tharthac, no matter how rich he may become, or what hightitles he may achieve, can never be a real aristocrat, or substitute himself inthe place of Nembroud; for genuine nobility always originates in highwayrobbery, armed pillage, and the power of thePicture #118 [images/img_0118.png]Picture #119 [images/img_0119.png]108sword, — never in usurious gains, fraudulent commerce, shoddy-contracts,perversion of public funds, and the power of the strong-box.*When his Majesty the Emperor Nembroud is engaged in foreign wars,Tharthac-TaUeyrand, Tharthac-Fouche, and their like, work themselves into hisconfidence, and become his trusted ministers.Nembroud never fails to be betrayed at the critical moment. This fact is placedbeyond doubt by the almost unvarying testimony of history. The knaves held insubjection by Nembroud, and the knaves who have acted as his instruments, joinhands with the knaves and desperadoes who are his avowed and official enemies.Nembroud’s armies become demoralized by the defection, and are defeated at theend in every encounter, as Napoleon I. and Sardanapalus, and their like, standready to testify. New rulers are raised up; and a new order of things isinaugurated, — one not based precisely on violence, or precisely on fraud, butrather on a happy synthetic combination of violence with fraud.The portrait of “Acham,” the representative of legalized scoundrelism, and thelegitimate defender of frauds (interests) organized into institutions, is givenon the opposite page. Acham seems, from his attitude in the picture, to be allright; and he would be all right, were it not for the presence of the littledevil that holds up his train.t“Nahema” (sometimes wrongly taken for “ Lilith,” who is Satan’s wife) t is therepresentative of the special wide* It wi« under the Orleans dynasty, which Is hla authentic embodiment, thatTharthao shone, with transcendent splendor, in the realm of France.t Napoleon III. was Nerabroud-Aoham: M.

She seduces Acham, leads him astray,and causes him to destroy himself by his own folly.She reigned triumphantly in the times of the regency in France, was theprincipal ornament of the court circles of Napoleon III., and graced thebanqueting-table of Belshazzar when he was slain in his own palace by the Medesand Persians. Her mighty deeds are everywhere spoken of in history. Her portraitwill be found in the margin.“ Nabam,” the personage whose portrait is given on the next page, is thegentleman in the clerk’s office, with whom we, all of us, whether collectivepeoples or individual men and women, will have to settle our accounts, Saturdaynight, for the week’s work. Nabam is Saturn, Nahema is Venus,Acham is Jupiter, Tharthac is Mercury, Nembroud is Mars, and the Light-bearer isthe Moon; and all of them, as here depicted, are shining with malignant aspect.And thus ends the eventful history of the life and adventures of “ Mr. Badman.”The characteristics of the planets, as afflicted, are herePicture #121 [images/img_0121.png]Picture #122 [images/img_0122.png]108given in some detail, and their normal characteristics are analogous to thosestated, but opposite. If the reader desires a more full account of thecharacteristics of the several planets, he may find it in any good book ofastrology.Picture #123 [images/img_0123.png]Conclusion.Thus far we have been able, and with no little difficulty, to trace, in a verysuperficial manner, the deep doctrine of the Kabbala. Our exposition is whollyinadequate, and perhaps, in some minor points, incorrect; for the texts we haveinterpreted are very dark. We trust, however, that what we have said willsuffice to break the ten seals of the lesser Zohar, and to make it an open book.Picture #124 [images/img_0124.png]THEFACTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS,AHDTHE PHILOSOPHY OP MR. HERBERT SPENCER.10 109Picture #125 [images/img_0125.png]THE FACTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS,AMDTHE PHILOSOPHY OP MB. HERBEBT SPENCER.What Is conteiotunessf It is the state which the Ego is In when it perceivesthat it is perceiving.Certain French physiologists inform us, that when we see an outward object, saya tree for example, we take cognizance of it, not with the whole brain, but withone only of the two hemispheres into which the brain is found, upon inspection,to be divided. They say, furthermore, that, as soon as the one half of the brainbegins to take cognizance of the outward object, the other half begins to takecognizance of the act of the first half. Thus, according to this scheme, manperceives with one half of the brain, and with the other half becomes consciousof the perception. This theory is unsatisfactory. It is partially confirmed byauthentic cases recorded of men and women paralyzed in one half of the body, andconsequently in one half of the brain, who retain the ^faculty of perception,but speak from themselves, not as 7, but inthe third person only, as he or sfo, showing that theyinPicture #126 [images/img_0126.png]112have lost the sentiment of their own personality. We have, however, never heardof any special case where a man was inwardly conscious, or professed himself tobe inwardly conscious, that he perceived with one half of his brain, andperceived the perception with the other. Besides, the theory is not properlyverified; and there are very few scientific men, u indeed any, who would assignto it a rank higher than that of a mere hypothesis dealing with mental machineryonly, and the manner of its working, but saying nothing of the inward force thatperceives. Let us take it, therefore, for what it appears to be worth, and passto the consideration of other and equally plausible hypotheses.Many psychologists affirm that there is in the nature of ideas, cognitions,notions, and perceptions, an inhering necessity for such a concatenation orassociation of each with all the others, as will account, among other things,for the observed facts o.f consciousness. Spinoza says, “We clearly understandwhy the mind from the thought of one thing immediately falls into the thought ofanother, which has no resemblance to the first. For example : from the thoughtof the word pomum, a Roman immediately thinks of a certain fruit, — an apple,which has no resemblance to the articulate sound, nor any thing in common withit, save that the body of the man was often affected at once by the two things,the word and the apple; he having often heard the word pomum when seeing thefruit it signified. It is in this way that thoughts of one thing lead tothoughts of another, according as custom or habit orders thePicture #127 [images/img_0127.png]118imagination of the thing in the body. A soldier, for instance, when he sees thefoot-prints of a horse in the sand, from thoughts of the horse immediately fallsinto thoughts of the rider of the horse, thence into thoughts of war, Ac.;whilst a peasant, from such foot-prints, forthwith falls into thoughts offields, ploughs, Ac.: that is, each in his own way, and as he is wont to connectthe images of things, passes from one thought into another of this or thatcomplexion.” The following affirmations, or the substance of them, arefrequently met with in philosophical writings, though seldom, if ever, under adistinct form of statement. They are suggested to us at this time by scatteredenunciations and illustrations found in the books of Mr. Herbert Spencer: —Since every mental state is involved, by the accidental circumstances of itsoccurrence, with every other mental state, it follows that each state suggestsevery other state, and that all the states form a connected series, in whicheach term implies, and is implied by, all the other terms. Thus all the mentalstates form one complex whole, a unity of totality, so thoroughly united, thatthe whole exists in each part, and each part in the whole. This inter-relationbetween mental states,’by which the mind, in reviewing them, is able to passregularly from one to another, is conscioume88; and the organic sum-total of allthe mental states, actual and potential, of any individual who calls himselfEgo, is precisely that entity which the individual designates as Ego.This theory is also unsatisfactory. The affirmationthat the mental states, taken together, of any individ10*Picture #128 [images/img_0128.png]114ual man, make up an organic unity of totality, of which the destruction of anyone part would involve the destruction of the whole, is not unplausible ; butthe affirmation, that this organic unity of totality is what the individualcognizes as Ego, awakens doubt. The Ego cognizes itself as perceiver, and not asa mass of perceptions. Such is the fact as shown by authentic observation inconsciousness. We speak from the facts of our own consciousness ; and the readerknows better than we do whether the facts of his consciousness are like those ofours.Men, generally, when they enter a shop where articles are made by machinery,distinguish between themselves and the machinery, and also between themselvesand the working of the machinery 5 cognizing the machinery, and the working ofthe machinery, as things perceived, and cognizing themselves (but without givingspecial definiteness to their notion of themselves) as perceivers. In likemanner, meditative men (and such men are not met with every day), when theyinspect the working of their own minds, distinguish between themselves and theirmental states, and also between themselves and the mechanism, and the working ofthe mechanism, of their own minds; cognizing their mental states, the mechanismof their own minds, and the workings of that mechanism, as things perceived;while they cognize themselves, on the contrary, not as things perceived, but asperceivers. It follows from what is here said, that facts of direct andauthentic observation, which every intelligent observer is competent to verifyfor himself, go to confirm our definition of consciousness as wePicture #129 [images/img_0129.png]115have given it, and to show that consciousness is, as we have said,44 the statethe Ego is in when it perceives that it is perceiving; ” and to explode thecounter definition, that 44 consciousness is the inter-relation between mentalstates, by which the mind, in reviewing them, is enabled to pass from any one ofthem to any or all of the others.” The same facts go to show that the Ego, whichis revealed to itself as a perceiver, is not at all that organic sum-total ofmental states which is revealed to it as something that it perceives, and fromwhich, as such, it contradistinguishes itself. Authentic observation teaches usthat the Ego is conscious of itself, always as perceiver, and never as thingperceived.This false and utterly untenable theory, that44 consciousness is thatinter-relation between mental states, by which the mind, in reviewing them, isenabled to pass from any one of them to any or all of the others,” is the oneintentionally set forth, if we under- * derstand him rightly, by Mr. HerbertSpencer, in his book entitled “First Principles of a New System of Philosophy.”* Mr. Spencer gives no definition of the* Mr. Spencer says (Principles of Psychology, p. 600), 44 Considered as aninternal perception, the current illusion respecting the will consists insupposing that at each moment the Ego if something more than the aggregate offeelings and ideas, actual and nascent, which then exists.”Speaking of a voluntary action, he says, 44 But the entire group of psychicalstates which constituted the antecedent of the action also constituted himself”— that is, constituted the man, or actor—44 at that moment.— constituted his psychical self; that is, as distinguished from his physical Itis alike true that he determined the action, and that the aggregate of hisfeelings and ideas determined it: since, during its existence, this aggregateconstituted Ids then state of consciousness; that is, himself.”—Psgc., p. 601.And again: M The composite psychical state which excites the action isPicture #130 [images/img_0130.png]116word consciousness; in fact, he gives no philosophical definition of any thingwhatever: bat he allows his notion, such as it is, of consciousness, to begathered from a comparison of scattered sentences. Mr. Spencer’s book may beauthority in matters of physical science; we are not competent to express anyopinion on this head: but why he should have characterized it as a treatise ofphilosophy, we know not. According to Mr: Spencer, the expressions mental stateand state of consciousness are equivalent in meaning. We will, in a moment,quote texts of his wherein he intimates as much. But he ought to know, anddoubtless does know, that the word mind is exceedingly comprehensive; while theword consciousness, on the contrary, is somewhat exclusive. The mind has many(so-called) faculties; as attention, memory, imagination, and the like, amongwhich consciousness counts as one only. Every state of consciousness is a mentalstate; but there are many mental states that are not at all states ofconsciousness.Mr. Spencer says, “ Consciousness implies perpetual change, and the perpetualestablishment of relations between its successive phases. To be known at all,every mental affection must be known as such or such; as like these foregoingones, or unlike those: if it isat the same time the Ego which is said to will the action. Naturally enough,then, the subject of such psychical changes says that he wills the action;since, psychically considered, he is at that moment nothing more than thecomposite state of consciousness by which the action is excited.” — Psycp. 601.We quote these extracts from the Principles of Psychology, instead of recitingpassages from the First Principles of Philosophy; for it is our aim to show thatMr. Spencer’s doctrine is one and the same in his different books. Ourquotations from the First Principles of Philosophy will be given, not in thefootnotes, but in the text.Picture #131 [images/img_0131.png]117not thought of in connection with others, not distinguished or identified bycomparison with others, it is not recognized, is not a state of consciousness atall.”—First Principles, p. 63. That is to say, consciousness, objectivelyconsidered, appears in a senes of successive states, every one of which iscontradistinguished from every other, although each one of them implies, and isimplied by, the others.* Mr. Spencer goes on to ask, in this connection, a verysuggestive question, as follows: u What shall we say of these successive ideasand impressions that constitute consciousness ? ” The word constitute is astrong one. Our successive states of consciousness constitute, in the sense ofgiving origin to them, the contents of the field of memory and imagination thatis spread before our inward vision; but they no more constitute consciousnessthan the successive phases of the moon constitute the moon. Our successiveobservations of the moon give us such pictures as we can make for ourselves, inimagination, of that satellite of the earth; but our imaginative picture of themoon, and its inherent constitution, are two different things. Consciousness isthe immediate knowledge that the Ego has of itself as perceiving agent; and thatknowledge is consciousness so long only as it is immediate. A past act ofconsciousness is no longer an act of consciousness ; for it has become a fact ofmemory. When the Ego perceives a fact of memory, it perceives consciously; butthe consciousness is in the present* “ Every element of that aggregate of activities constituting a conscioussea isknown as belonging to consciousness only by its cohesion with the rest.”—Piya,p. 161.Picture #132 [images/img_0132.png]118perception, not in the past one. The act of consciousness is always present.When the Ego knows knowingly, it is itself the knowing subject; the thing thatit contradistinguishes from itself as non-Ego, and thing known, is the object;the immediate knowledge which the subject has of the object is the relationbetween the two: subject, object, and relation — not successive states —constitute consciousness. In the lax, improper, ordinary, unphilosophical, andindefinite use of the word consciousness, our whole life of memory andimagination is characterized as a life of consciousness: and we are said to beconscious of things when we remember them, or imagine them only; that is, whenwe are conscious, not of the things, but of some former states of consciousnessnow existing in memory, in which states we were conscious of the things, or ofsomething vaguely analogous to them. We are personally acquainted withblockheads who say they are conscious of their own immortality. Much latitudemust be allowed to native stupidity, to torpidity of brain, and to restlessfrivolity; but, from Mr. Spencer, better things than these were expected. Mr.Spencer says again, “ The personality of which each is conscious, and of whichthe existence is to each a fact beyond all others the most certain, is yet athing which cannot truly be known at all: knowledge of it is forbidden by thenature of thought.”—F. P., p. 66. We are confident that the case is not at allso desperate as it is here represented. We will trust ourselves to make a fewfeeble remarks on this point.In consciousness, the Ego always knows itself as subPicture #133 [images/img_0133.png]119ject, the object as object, and the relation as relation.* The Ego is neverconscious of itself as object: and, when it considers itself as object, it doesso, not in consciousness (although it may do it consciously), but by means ofrepresentations that it objectively makes of itself to itself in memory andimagination; which representations are almost always (probably always) more orless deceptive. Again: the Ego is never conscious of the object as subject; but,when it affirms that an object (say another Ego') is also subject in some otfhersystem of consciousness, it does so on the strength of reasoning by induction,basing its affirmations on congruities and incongruities presented to itobjectively by facts of memory and imagination. Finally, there are very few men(and Mr. Spencer does not appear to be of the select number) that have madethemselves competent, by long self-training and by painful reflection, todistinguish clearly between the subject and object in consciousness. All men,however, appear to be competent to perceive the relation that holds both objectand subject in solution. All men are, apparently, conscious of the act ofimmediate knowing; which act is the relation between the subject and the object,and implies, to discerning persons, but to discerning persons only, both thesubject and the object. By what word is this relation* “ To say that a state of consciousness has considerable continuity, is to saythat it is a distinct element of consciousness; which is the same thing as beingknown or felt.” —Psyc., p. 479.Every state of consciousness is a systematic whole, composed of three dementi,and no more,—subject, object, relation. One state of consciousness differs fromanother by reason of a difference in the objects, and, consequently, in therelations; but the subject is always the same.Picture #134 [images/img_0134.png]120designated in common language? Obviously, it is not called relation; for, if theordinary mind could compass the notion of relation in consciousness, it would beaware, which it is not, of the contradistinction between the subject and theobject. The relation is sometimes called by persons advanced in the art ofreflection, but who have not yet attained to distinct self-consciousness,immediate knowledge ; and sometimes it is called, but more vaguely, intuition.But what is the common word used by everybody to designate this special thingthat everybody ajfpears to know ? In the English language, the clearlyapprehended relation between the subject and the object — apprehended, however,not as a relation, but as something given in itself—is called life. If any manwill analyze the immediate intuition he has of his own life, he will find itresolve itself into an intuition of himself as knower, an intuition of someobject known, and an intuition of the act of knowing; that is, he will find hehas been analyzing the fact of his own consciousness. Few men have any clearknowledge of themselves as subject: but every man knows that he is alive ; everyman has an intuition, in consciousness, of his own life. Men are not conscious,and we are forward to confess it, of the life of the body. Consciousness, orimmediate intuition, says nothing to man about the circulation of the blood, thefunctions of the liver, or the movements of digestion. If men know any thingabout the life of the body, or know even the bare fact of the body’s life, theyknow it scientifically only, as they know any other physiological fact, andderive their knowledge from observaPicture #135 [images/img_0135.png]121tion and induction.* It is the life of the soul, and that life only, which isimmediately perceived in consciousness. What is the life of the soul ?Observation in consciousness teaches us that it is a life of intelligence; thatit consists mainly in immediate knowing: for if we feel, or will, we know thatwe feel, and know that we will. More careful and somewhat painful observationteaches us that there is not only a life of the soul, but also something that isalive, — a knower. This knower perceives itself as subject, never as object, andas an intelligence; and this immediate perception, or intuition, of active andspontaneous intelligence, is the only adequate knowledge the soul has of thefact of intelligence. If the soul attribute intelligence to other beings, itdoes so by induction only, and in the light of its intuitive notion ofintelligence. The soul also perceives itself as one in the strictest sense ofthe word unity. It has also intuitions of identity and diversity. We mightcontinue this enumeration through a detailed list of a thousand and one otherintuitions, all of them unscientific in the sense that they are above science*and conditions without which science would be impossible. Such is the genesis offirst truths.* u Life is the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external’relations.** — Psyc., p. 208. This appears to be a partial description of thecircumstances and manifestations of life, rather than a definition of Iifoitself. If the remarks in our text are well founded, Hfe is the spontaneous*activity of a real subject: therefore, since there is no subject without anobject, att life is subjective-objective. In intellectual life, consciousness isactualtfi the lower forms of life, it is, perhaps, potential only. Mr. Spencerwill never accept these lost statements: for the affirmation of the spontaneityof tho subject— that is, of the reality of the subject—is the negation of hispeculiar theory of the persistency of force; that is to say, of his absolute andsyBtematio materialism.11Picture #136 [images/img_0136.png]122Why, then, does Mr. Spencer say that our own personality, the thing of which (byhis confession) we are more certain than we are of any other, is a thing nottruly known at all ? Why does he say that the very nature of thought forbids allknowledge by us of our own selves ? What does he mean by thought ? Mr. Spencerhas trained himself to the methods of physical science; but, as it would appear,he has not trained himself to habits of observation in consciousness. The Ego isconscious of a multitude of things as objects, and contradistinguishes them fromeach other, notes their peculiar characteristics, classifies them, and obtainsvivid imaginative representations of them. This contradistinction of objectsfrom each other, this noting of their peculiarities, this classification ofthem, this obtaining of vivid representations of them in imagination, is whatMr. Spencer calls thought. According to him, the knowledge the Ego has of itselfas subject is no knowledge at all, and has no place in the realm of thought,because it is not objective knowledge. In point of fact (and to that extent Mr.Spencer is in th3 right), the Ego is for itself, so far as conscious knowledgeis concerned, alone of its kind: it knows itself as subject, not as object, andknows no* other subject directly: it has nothing with which it can compareitself, and render vivid, by similitude or contrast, the utterly inadequatenotion that it forms of itself in imagination; and it classifies itself asaltogether outside of all classification.* Mr. Spencer may, therefore, very well* “ Under its subjective aspect, psychology is a totally unique science,independent of, and antithetically opposed to, all other sciences whatever. Thethoughtt and feelings that constitute a consciousness ( ?), and are absolutelyPicture #137 [images/img_0137.png]128affirm that the Ego does not know itself in the same way that it knows objects,since it knows itself as subject, and not as object; also that it does not comeby induction to a knowledge of itself as it does to a knowledge of the facts ofphysical science, since it knows itself directly, and not by induction, assubject : but he talks absurdly when he says that “ the thing of which we areconscious, the thing of which we are the most certain,”'is a thing 44 that we donot truly know at all.” He may put away a caterpillar, transfixed with a pin, inits proper place in his glass cabinet, as something identified, thoroughlyknown, and duly labelled: nevertheless, Mr. Spencer’s soul, which is always withhim, as a thing outside of all classification, is better known to him, althoughnot objectively known, not picturable in his imagination, than any dead anddried-up object in his whole collection.*We submit the following syllogism (if it may be called one) to the reader, forpurposes of illustration: 44 That which is known to the subject is objective:sometimes the Ego becomes known to itself; therefore the subject is sometimesits own object.” Thisinaccessible to any bat the possessor of that consciousness, form an existencethat has no place among the existences with which the rest of the sciencesdeal.\" — Piyc., 140.* “ To know any thing is to distinguish it as such or each; to class it as ofthis or that order. An object is said to be but little known when it is alien toobjects of which we have had experience ; and it is said to be well known whenthere is a great community of attributes between it and objects of which we havehad experience. Hence, by implication, an object U completely known when thisrecognized community is complete, and coayletelg unknown when there is norecognised community at ad.”—Piyc., p. 148.Picture #138 [images/img_0138.png]124is a mere sophistical catch of words. For the subject is known to itself inconsciousness, always as subject, and never as object. It is, therefore, nottrue that every thing known to the subject is objective. All this, we take it,is very plain: nevertheless, ingenious and subtle thinkers, adopting thevocabulary of their own language for ontological authority, and using the rulesof syntax for dialectics, have brought them* selves to believe, through* thissame verbal catch, that the subject is, in consciousness, its own object. VictorCousin, who ought to have known better, and did know better, forgot himself inlistening to his own talk, as was his not unfrequent custom, and affirmed thesubject to be its own object; thus delivering himself over, bound hand aud foot,to the tender mercies of Sir W. Hamilton, who stood ready to attend to his case,and did attend to it. Jouffroy, a disciple of Cousin, talked so bewilderingly inhis books about consciousness, simply because the spectator in the pit of atheatre sees the actor who is on the stage, that his readers came to doubtwhether they were the actor on the stage, or the spectator in the pit, or thespectator on the stage, or the actor in the pit, or whether they were both inthe pit and on the stage, or neither in the pit nor on the stage. Pierre Lerouxeffectually attended to Jouffroy’s case.Mr. Mansel, as quoted by Mr. Spencer, says, “Consciousness is impossible exceptin the form of a relation. There must be a subject, or person conscious, and anobject, or thing of which he is conscious. There can be no consciousness withoutthe union of these two factors; andy in that union, each exists onlyPicture #139 [images/img_0139.png]125a% it is related to the other. The subject is subject only so far as it isconscious of an object; the object is object only so far as it is apprehended bya subject; and the destruction of either is the destruction of consciousnessitself” —F. P., p. 78. This is the truth, but not the whole truth. We have nothad the good fortune to read any of Sir W. Hamilton’s writings, and know them atsecond-hand only, and from extracts quoted into other books. We are neverthelessconfident that the foregoing is a correct statement of Hamilton’s doctrine. Wesubscribe to it in all its parts: we might wish to add to it; but we would notalter a word of it.Mr. Spencer quotes also from Mr. Mansel the following sentences of a differenttenor, and without any expression of disapprobation: “The ver3r conception ofconsciousness, in whatever mode it may be manifested, necessarily impliesdistinction between one object and another. To be conscious, we must beconscious of something; and that something can only be known as that which it isby being distinguished from that which it is not.”—F. P., p. 76. Mr. Spencerdraws attention to six of these words by putting them in Italics, indicatingthat they contain the really important part of the statement. They are, in fact,important, and for two reasons: first, because the affirmation covered by thesewords is the only one in the whole statement that is distinctly false; and,secondly, because they show that — let him know what he may about mind ingeneral—Mr. Spencer knows very little about consciousness in particular. In theact of consciousness, as such, thePicture #140 [images/img_0140.png]126distinction is never between one object and another, as Mr. Mansel affirms, andMr. Spencer intimates, but always between the subject and the object; which issomething very different. Speaking for himself, and quoting neither Hamilton norMansel, Mr. Spencer says, 44 Every complete act of consciousness, besidesdistinction and relation, also implies likeness. Before it can become an idea,or constitute a piece of knowledge, a mental state must not only be known asseparate in kind from certain foregoing states to which it is known as relatedby succession, but it must further be known as of. the same kind with certainother foregoing states.” —F, P., p. 79. Pourquoi ? Mr. Spencer begins with themention of consciousness, and goes on to talk about the general action of themind. For him, an 44 act of consciousness ” and a 44 mental state ” are the samething. Nothing can be known, according to him, that cannot be objectivelydistinguished from something else that is objectively known, and also 44 likened” to some certain other thing that is objectively known: nothing, he intimates,can become “a piece of knowledge ” until it has become a fact of memory. Thereis no method of acquiring knowledge except the one used by naturalists in theprosecution of physical investigations ; and therefore that which is knownimmediately, by infallible intutition, is not known at all. We are now preparedto take cognizance, without astonishment, of the following remarkable sentence:u It may readily be shown that a cognition of self, properly so called, isabsolutely negatived by the laws of thought.”—F. P., p. 66. These are no mereverbalPicture #141 [images/img_0141.png]127cavils. Mr. Spencer ignores, not only in his definitions (such as they are) andin his first principles, the whole spiritual nature of man, but he does the sametiling in his extended expositions. His entire doctrine is a thinly-disguisedsystem of materialism; and the ostentatious arguments against materialism, inhis treatise on Psychology, are simply sophistical and misleading, being basedon mistaken presentations of the question.* It is, of course, impossible for usto quote Mr. Spencer’s extended expositions: the space at our disposal allows ofnothing of the kind. We refer the reader to Mr. Spencer’s books.We quote one other passage as conclusive: “ The mental act in which self isknown implies a perceiving subject and a perceived object. If, then, the objectperceived is self, what is the subject that perceives ? or, if it be the trueself that thinks, what other self can it be that is thought of? Clearly a truecognition of self implies a state in which the knower and the known are one,— inwhich the subject and object are identified; and this Mr. Mansel rightly holdsto be the annihilation of both.” — F. P., p. 65. There is your verbal catch foryou! Neither Cousin nor Jouffroy ever perpetrated any thing more exquisite th*mthis piece of reasoning. Who told Mr. Spencer that the object perceived inconsciousness is self? Self is the* “ Those who wish to see materialism refuted by philosophic reasoning, and notby appeals to vulgar prejudice, may be referred to the latter portion of Mr.Spencer’s lately-published volume on Psychology.” — Letter of March 1, 1871, tothe New- York World, from Mr. John Fitke of liar* vard UmoertUg.Picture #142 [images/img_0142.png]128suigect perceived. The subject and the object are never identified inconsciousness. “ The subject is subject only so far as it is conscious of anobject.’9 To be conscious of an object is to consciously perceive that object:therefore, when the subject is conscious of an object as object, it is also, andin the same act, always conscious of itself as subject. Observation inconsciousness is the only evidence to be adduced on this point. If the subjectattempt to cognize itself directly as object, consciousness is at once lost, andremains lost until the subject again cognizes some object as object. Attempts ofthe subject to cognize itself directly as object are utterly futile : they,moreover, often occasion a dangerous disorganization of the nervous system, and,if persisted in, may provoke abnormal trances, perhaps ending in death. In thefull act of consciousness, the subject, the object, and the relation, all threeof them, become known to the subject, — the subject as subject, the object asobject, and the relation as relation.Mr. Spencer says, again, “ In brief, a thing cannot at the same instant be bothsubject and object of thought; and yet the substance of mind must be this beforeit can be known.” — Psyc., p. 148. Since, according to Mr. Spencer, the subjectcannot know itself as subject, and since, certainly, as Mr. Spenceracknowledges, it cannot know itself as object, we respectfully inquire upon whatgrounds Mr. Spencer affirms that there is any subject at all. A philosophy thatignores the human soul is usually characterized as a materialistic philosophy,just as a philosophy that ignores God is characterized as an atheistic philosoPicture #143 [images/img_0143.png]129phy. The facts being patent, why does Mr. Fiske defend Mr. Spencer from theimputation of materialism?Materialism naturally gives birth to a system of morality that is more practisedthan praised. To call a man a materialist is to give him a bad name.Nevertheless, a man should never desert, or be ashamed of, his own colors: if heis a materialist, both ije and his friends ought either to say so, or to saynothing on the subject. The conscientious materialists, and their firstdisciples, are usually estimable and well-meaning men. It is not they, but thepromiscuous and more practical adherents to their doctrines, who professedly putMammon above God, and to-day organize the religion of the legislative lobbiesand political caucuses, the religion of the Bonapartes, of the Rothschilds, andof Shoddy; the religion of the great manufacturing centres ; the religion ofWall Street, State Street, and the wharves; the religion of the Englishploutocracy; the religion of interested philanthropy and of despotic charity; inshort, the religion of the special corrupt and corrupting tendences of thenineteenth century, against the religion of Him who said, “It is easier for acamel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdomof heaven.” Materialism is the philosophy, not of sensuality, but of the powerand course of this world. Sensuality is a law to itself, and asks no sanctionfrom philosophy. Jesus made a whip of small cords, and drove the money-changersout of his Father’s temple; but to-day, in many of the Boston and New-Yorkchurches, the moneyPicture #144 [images/img_0144.png]180changers drive Jesus out of his own temple. If materialism is true, then thereligion of Mammon is true, and the religion of the New Testament is anenthusiastic error. Jesus said,44 For judgment I am come into the world. . . .Now is the judgment of this world; now is the prince of this world cast out. . .. The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. ... If the world hateyou, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, yeknow that the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, butI have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. . . . Theworld cannot receive the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, because it seeth himnot, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shallbe in you. . . . Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as theworld giveth give I unto you.” The style of the New Testament, as a relief fromthe style of Mr. Spencer, is absolutely refreshing. It is consoling to thinkthat the spirit of the nineteenth century is the spirit of the nineteenthcentury only; while the spirit of Christ is of yesterday, to-day, and forever.In reading the first part of Mr. Spencer’s book, we learn that his professedmethod is one of elimination, and not one of synthesis. He has no faith in thereconciliation of contradictions, or rather no accurate knowledge of the theoryof such reconciliation. When he is in the presence of a contradiction, heexpunges every thing on either side that conflicts with any thing on the other.The residuum, which he presents as something large and comprehensive, is, usualPicture #145 [images/img_0145.png]181ly, a fact, not of knowledge, but of ignorance, and yet a fact which impliesthat there is something to be known, — a fact so vague, so abstract, and soindefinite, that few persons would care whether it is verifiable, or thecontrary. He says, 44 We have to ; compare all opinions of the same genus; toset aside, as more or less discrediting one another, those various special andconcrete elements in which such opinions disagree; to observe what remains afterthe discordant constituents have been eliminated; and to find for this remainingconstituent that abstract expression which holds true throughout its divergentmodifications.” — F. P., p. 127. Again: after enumerating several specialsystems of philosophy, he Bays, “ That which remains as the common element inthese conceptions of philosophy, after the elimination of their discordantelements, is knowledge of the highest degree of generality” — F. P., p. 131. TheItalics are Mr. Spencer’s. This method is essentially Oriental, — between threeand four thousand years behind the times, and perhaps derived from the sages ofBenares. Fortunately for himself and for his readers, Mr. Spencer is, on almostall occasions where matters of natural science are concerned, utterly false tohis own method.In the publisher’s advertisement, printed at the end of the book, the followingsentences are quoted from 44The National Quarterly Review:” 44It was reservedfor Herbert Spencer to discover the fundamental and all-comprehensive law whichis found to explain alike the phenomena of man’s history and those of externalnature. This sublime discovery,Picture #146 [images/img_0146.png]132that the universe is in a continuous process of evolution from the homogeneousto the heterogeneous, with which only Newton’s law of gravitation is at allworthy to be compared, underlies not only physics, but also history. It revealsthe law to which social changes conform.” In point of fact, the statement thatthe process of evolution is from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is thetrue culminating point of Mr. Spencer’s book. This law, however, is notobtainable by Mr. Spencer’s method of elimination and exhaustion. It is theresolution by synthesis, and not by elimination, of a special contradiction. Itis an old and well-known Hegelian formula, used frequently by Proudhon, andsomewhat modified in the enunciation by Mr. Spencer, but not improved by themodification. Besides, the Hegelians do not claim it as originating withthemselves, — at the least, they ought not to claim it. It is, in allappearance, cabalistic ; and we should not be in the least surprised to find itin the Zohar, or Book of Splendor.Mr. Spencer is, however, in matters that would % seem to require an observationby the mind of its own operations, usually true to his own method. In thepresence of a psychological contradiction, he never thinks of observing thefacts in his own mind, but immediately tabulates what is said on the one sideand the other of the question, strikes out the disdiscordant terms, and takesthe worthless residuum for a statement of final and general truth. When Hamiltonuses astonishing phrases, such as, “ the conditionally unlimited,” “ theunconditionally unlimited,” and bewildering terms, such as “ the unthinkaPicture #147 [images/img_0147.png]183ble,” it is very easy to find common words to express all that is true andexpressible in them, leaving the strange terms and phrases themselves to performtheir only proper purpose, — that of amazing the groundlings. But this is notMr. Spencer’s method. Besides, the faculty of tall talking did not die withHamilton.* When Sir W. Hamilton, yielding to the proclivities of his mentalconstitution, simply “squirts,” Mr. Spencer, with some strange sextant that hehas, takes the altitude of the “ squirt; ” and he also takes the amplitude, anddetermines the orientation of the same, by means of some strange azimuth compassthat he uses. If nobody “ squirts ” on the opposite side of the question,Hamilton’s* “ If by the phrase,1 substance of mind,* is to be understood mind asqualitatively differentiated in each portion that is inseparable byintrospection, but seems homogeneous and undecomposable, then we do knowsomething about the substance of mind, and may eventually know more.” — Psyc.,p. 145. The style of the first half of this passage appears to be neither “qualitatively nor quantitatively differentiable ” from that of some of our morelearned female-suffrage ladies: it is a style to be avoided.Again: “ We call that person a materialist who maintains the metaphysicalthesis, that the objective reality which underlies and causes the phenomenalmanifestations of consciousness is identical with the objective reality whichunderlies and causes the phenomenal manifestations of matter; and who,furthermore, insists upon calling this single objective reality and common causeof the two sets of phenomena by the name of matter.” — Mr. Fuke'i Letter ofMarch 1 to the New-York World. We take off our hat in the presence of thisstupendous definition of materialism- Mr. Fisko fires these hard phrases at Dr.McCosh; and we place ourselves beyond reach of the explosion, with the remark, uLet the hardest fend off 1 ” But why does Mr. Fiske say, “ The olyective realitywhich underlies and causes the phenomenal manifestations of consciousness,” — ifany one knows what that may mean,—instead of saying, as he ought, “ theeubjedxet reality ” ? It is hardly fair to insinuate, by a mere catch of words,a denial of the real existence of the subject, and then to conclude the wholequestion by a captious definition. Better things than these were expected fromMr. Fiske.12Picture #148 [images/img_0148.png]134“ squirt ” goes bodily into Mr. Spencer’s residuum of truth, since thereaccidentally happens to be nothing to offset and cancel it. It is not Hamilton’smeaning that goes into the residuum; for Spencer never, when the question is oneof consciousness, or of observation in consciousness, catches Hamilton’smeaning: but it is the phenomenal 44 squirt ” itself, regarded as an observableand classifiable object of investigation, that goes in. Hamilton seems to havedone more than all other writers taken together for the bedevilling of what Mr.Spencer calls his M new system of philosophy.” If Mr. Spencer’s conclusionsdepend for their scientific vitality upon the premises and arguments by which hesupports them, their hold upon life is frail enough. For instance, Mr. Spencersays, 44 If it can be shown that the persistence of force is not a datum ofconsciousness, . . . then, indeed, it will be shown that the theory of evolutionhas not the high warrant claimed for it.” — F. P., p. 553. It is lawful to thinkand to affirm, that the theory of the persistence of force is not at all 44 adatum of consciousness; ” and also that the theory of evolution may be true, butfor reasons other than those assigned by Mr. Spencer. Mr. Spencer says also,“The sole truth that transcends experience by underlying it is the persistenceof force.”—F. P., p. 192. This is a remarkable statement ; but it excites in usno surprise. How does Mr. Spencer, or anybody else, know how many truths thereare that nobody as yet knows any thing about? We have the boldness to affirm,that the theory of the persistence of force, as it is presentedPicture #149 [images/img_0149.png]185by Mr. Spencer,* is distinctly not true. He says, again, “Deeper thandemonstration, deeper than definite cognition, deep as the very nature of mind,is the postulate at which we have anived. Its authority transcends all otherwhatever; for not only is it given in the constitution of our own consciousness,but it is impossible to imagine a consciousness so constituted as not to giveit” —F. P.,p. 192. The postulate here triumphantly celebrated, and nowhereproved, is that of the persistence of force. The Italics are ours: we might alsohave given exclamation-marks ; but there is no call for them. It is a pity thatso much eloquence is so utterly wasted.Kreeshna says in the 44 Bhagvat Geeta,” 44 At the end of the formation, at theend of the day of Brahma, all things, O son of Koontee! return into myprimordial source; and, at the beginning of another formation, I create thefnall again. I plant myself in my own virtue, and create again and again thisassemblage of beings, this whole, from the power of Nature without power.” TheLaws of Menu speak to the same purpose, saying, 44 On the coming-forth of thatday, all things proceed from invisibility to visibility: so, on the approach ofnight, they are all dissolved away into that which is called invisible.” Mr.Spencer says, 44 A philosophy is self-convicted of inadequacy if it does notformulate the whole series of changes passed through by every existence in itspassage from the imperceptible to the perceptible, and again from theperceptible to the imperceptible.” —* Mr. Spencer’s theory of the “persistence of force,” and the ordinary theory ofthe “ conservation of force,” are two different things.Picture #150 [images/img_0150.png]136F. P, p. 641. If the philosophies can stand this statement, we can. He saysalso, “ If, as we have seen reason to think, there is an alternation ofevolution and dissolution in the totality of things; if, as we aro obliged toinfer from the persistence of fprce, the arrival at either limit of this vastrhythm bring about the conditions under which a counter-movement commences; ifwe are hence compelled to entertain the conception of evolutions that havefilled an immeasurable past, and evolutions that will fill an immeasurablefuture, — we can no longer contemplate the visible creation as having a definitebeginning or end, or as being isolated. It becomes unified with all existencebefore and after; and the force which the universe presents falls into the samecategory with its space and time, as admitting of no limitation in thought” — F.P., p. 551. Personally, we know not which statement to prefer,—that of Kreeshna,or that of Mr. Herbert Spencer. We therefore deny neither of them. We mightquote passages from the physics of the ancient Stoics, and also from thespeculations of Spinoza, analogous to passages that might be quoted fromSpencer; but, in doing so, we should transgress the limits we have set forourselves. We cast no doubts on the originality of Mr. Spencer: we suppose heworked out his conclusions for himself. We merely remark, that we find little ornothing in his book of “ First Principles ” that we have not read elsewhere, andmany years ago.If, instead of eliminating the discordant elements from the printed opinions ofrepresentative Englishmen, to obtain a residuum of possible truth, Mr.Picture #151 [images/img_0151.png]187Spencer had applied himself to the observation of facts, we think he would haveconfirmed the knowledge the Ego has of itself, and also the knowledge it has offirst truths, somewhat in the manner following, — only, of course, Mr. Spencerwould have done his work much better for himself than we can do it for him: —How do we obtain our knowledge of time? We look at any mass of matter that is inmotion, — as, for example, at the hand of a clock, — and we say, It is not nowwhere it was; and, during its motion, time has elapsed. But if the I which makesthe affirmation be the same with the thoughts, and not a higher persistingsomething transcending them, the I that looked at the clock some time ago is notthe same I that looks at the clock now; for the thoughts and perceptions havechanged, else there would be nothing on which to predicate the affirmation of alapse of time. If there be not something in man which does not fall into time,something transcending time, then man has no knowledge of time: for theknowledge of time does not consist in a knowledge of one event, and a knowledgeof another event; but it consists in a knowledge of that relation between eventswhich is time. And this knowledge is never possessed except by something towhich both events are present; for, otherwise, how can the relation between thembe perceived ? If a first fact fall in time, and a second fact fall in time, theI must exist independently of time, else it can make no comparison; and, withouta comparison, it will be incapable of obtaining any notion of time. All thefacts of our memory are equally 12*Picture #152 [images/img_0152.png]138present to us: a fact that happened ten years ago is as present to the I as afact that happened yesterday. Time is not a relation of the I to the facts ofmemory; but it is a relation of order and succession that these facts have amongthemselves. The J, therefore, transcends time, and is in eternity, although allits acts take place in time. Eternity is not time indefinitely extended; it isnot a succession of an infinite number of moments; it is not time at all: fortime and'eternity exclude each other. Eternity is a never-beginning,never-ending, never-changing now.The recollection of the earliest event of my life that has left its trace in mymemory brings with it the conviction that I have remained identical to myselfever since the event took place. My body may have changed once in every sevenyears; but that which I call jEgo, /, is the same I now that it was then. Notonly does this act of memory bring with it the conviction of my identity; itbrings also the conviction that I have persisted through many changes; that theI has persisted through a certain lapse of time: but the I only is given asidentical; its thoughts, feelings, volitions, desires, &c., vary at everymoment. The identity is given as belonging to the I alone, and as apart from thesuccession of the thoughts, feelings, volitions, and desires; for if the I werenot, in itself, independently of its acts, identical, then the first thought ordesire would belong to one person, and the second thought or desire would belongto another person.* But our inward experience teaches us that* “ Either the Ego, ^hich is supposed to determine or will the action, ispresent in consciousness, or it is not. If it is not present in consciousness,Picture #153 [images/img_0153.png]139all our acts have been acts of the same person, of the same identical L The Idoes not persist because the thoughts succeed each other; for the persistence ofthe I is a necessary prior condition, without which the thoughts could notsucceed each other. Succession is one element only of duration: in order thatduration may be possible, there must be an identity to bind the discreteelements of succession to each other. A thing endures when it remains unchangedwhile something with which it is related undergoes continual alteration. Removethe identity which persists through the changes, and the continual alterationwill remain; but the duration will have vanished Etc.We have, therefore, as fesults of observation in consciousness, and from aninspection of the nature of our memory, a conviction of the reality of the Ego,and of its unity and identity; also the intuitions of time, duration, andeternity; and a door open through which we may pass to a multitude of otherintuitions of first truths. At the least, we obtain by this method results thatmay be discussed. In our opinion, we may obtain by it results that can beclothed with as high a degree of certainty as is compatibleit is something of which we are unconscious,—something, therefore, of whoseexistence we neither have, nor can have, any evidence. If it is present inconsciousness, then, as it is ever present, it can be at each moment nothingother than the state of consciousness, simple or compound, passing at thatmoment—Psgc., p. 601. Mr. Spencer will not admit that it is possible for the Egoto be present in consciousness as subject: if present at all, it must, accordingto him, be present as transitory (or, as he says, “ passing ”) object orrelation I Mr. Spencer would confer a favor by stating from what source,according to him, the Ego gathers its sentiment of its own identity. We are at aloss to know what it is in man, according to Mr. Spencer, that may possibly beimmortal.Picture #154 [images/img_0154.png]140with the essential limitations and relativeness of our knowing faculty, —results that are exact, special, definite, and satisfactory, and therefore notat all like the results of Mr. Spencer’s method, which are vague, indefinite,abstract, usually negative, of the highest degree of generality, and thereforein the highest degree useless. We are, we confess, no more certain of thevalidity of the first truths of which we have been speaking than we are of thatof the axioms of geometry. Our claims are modest; and we stand ready to prove,by Mr. Spencer’s method, — not by ours, — that it is a matter of no little doubtwhether the three angles of any plane triangle, taken together, are, or are not,equal to two* right angles. As to the reality of the JEgo, it is to us a fact(to use the language of Mr. Spencer) 44 more certain than any other.” And wethink we have succeeded in showing that we know it, at the least, as certainlyas we know any other.One word in conclusion. We thinly we find intimations, in the New Testament, ofsome of the things we have been trying to say. But we bring forward this pointwith great diffidence; for the texts are mysterious, perhaps obscure, and it ispossible that we may misinterpret them. Our Lord says (John xiv. 3), 441 go andprepare a place for you: I will come again, and receive you unto myself; thatwhere I am ye may be also.” He does not say, Where I was before I was madeflesh; neither does he say, Where I shall he after I shall be glorified: but hesays, Where I am. Immediately after, he says, 44 Whither I go ye know, and theway ye know; ” and, when the disciples disclaimed such knowledge,Picture #155 [images/img_0155.png]141he said, 441 am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Fatherbut by me.” Our Lord seems to identify his beatitude, and the beatitude hepromises to the disciples, with the condition of transcendency in whiph he is;for he says again (chap, xvii. 24),441 will that they also whom Thou hast givenme be with me where I am ; that they may behold my glory which thou hast givenme: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.” We know not how oursurmise may strike the reader; but the supposition seems rational to us, thatour Lord possessed from infancy, and constantly through his life, that clearconsciousness of his own essence, as something transcending time, which only oneout of multitudes of ordinary men have ever, and which that one has transientlyand very seldom. It is written (John viii. 57-59), 14 The Jews said unto Jesus,Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham ? Jesus said untothem, Yerily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. Then took theyup stones to cast at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.” Itis not to be supposed that Jesus intended to arrogate to himself theincommunicable name, or that he, in words, identified himself with the Father;for, if he had done so, he would have violated the express law of the Almightyas given by Moses, and the Jews would have been acting in the line of their dutywhen they took up stones to cast at him. We suppose, therefore, that our Lord,when he said these things, spoke as a man, and that his words may be quoted inconfirmation of Borne of the statements we have made.Picture #156 [images/img_0156.png]NOTE.Prof. T. H. Huxley, LL.D., F.R.S., says, in his lecture on the “ Physical Basisof Life,” —“ I take it to be demonstrable that it is utterly impossible to prove that anything whatever may not be the effect of a material and necessary cause, and thathuman logic is equally incompetent to prove that any aot is really spontaneous.A really spontaneous act is one which, by the assumption, has no cause; and theattempt to prove such a negative as this, is, on the face of the matter, absurd.And, while it is thus a physical impossibility to demonstrate that any givenphenomenon is not the effect of a material cause, any one who is acquainted withthe history of science will admit that its progress has, in all ages, meant, andnow more than ever means, the extension of the province of what we now callmatter and causation, and the concomitant gradual banishment from all regions ofhuman thought of what we call spirit and spontaneity.\"Descartes said, “ I think: therefore I am.” If the Ego thinks, the thinking is aspontaneous act, and this act has a cause; for the Ego which thinks is theefficient cause of its own thinking. There is no call here for what Mr. Huxleydesignates as “ human logic; ” for these affirmations are to be proved, ifproved at all, by observation and experience in consciousness, which is notexactly “ human logic.” It is not pretended that the soul acts withoutconjunction with the body in thinking, or that spirit acts without being inrelations with matter. Every act of thinking is, on one side, spontaneous ; and,on the other, determined. The fact of spontaneity is proved by observation inconsciousness; and the fact of determination is proved by the ordinary processesof natural science. Nei142Picture #157 [images/img_0157.png]143ther fact is proved by mere 11 logic.” Every act of life is at once subjectiveand objective, spontaneous and determined. Every act of life is a synthesis ofliberty and fatality.If the progress of physical science means, and has meant, as Mr. Huxleyintimates, the gradual banishment from men’s thoughts of the conceptions ofspontaneity and spirit, it is obvious that physical science naturally fallsshort of the truth, and requires to be supplemented by metaphysical science.Mr. Huxley Bays, furthermore, —“ Fact I know, and Law I know; but what is this Necessity, save an empty shadowof my own mind's throwing? But if it is certain that we can have no knowledge ofthe nature of either matter or spirit, and that the notion of necessity issomething illegitimately thrust into the perfectly-legitimate conception of law,the materialistic position, that there is nothing in the world but matter,force, and necessity, is as utterly void of justification as the most baselessof theological dogmas.\"Mr. Huxley, Mr. Spencer, Mr. John Fiske of Harvard University, and theirassociates, systematically — although, of course, unintentionally — misrepresentthe u materialistic position.” The materialistic formula is “Matter, force,chancenot “Matter, force, necessity ” A man who affirms the fact of necessity isno longer a consistent Materialist, but is on the broad road to Spiritualism.The pantheistic Idealists, who deny the very existence of matter, affirm, all ofthem, so far as we know them, the fact of necessity. Mr. Huxley, Mr. Spencer,and the rest, deny the fact of necessity, and suppose, in so doing, that theyprove their system to be not materialistic. They are mistaken.Mr. Huxley says in another place,—“ In Itself it is of little moment whether we express the phenomena of matter interms of spirit, or the phenomena of spirit in terms of matter. Matter may beregarded as a form of thought; thought may be regarded as a property of matter:each statement has a certain relative truth. But, with a view to the progress ofscienoe, the materialistic terminology iB in every way to be preferred.\"We apprehend that Mr. Huxley would find it advantageous, in treatingcontradictions-pregnant, to accept both terms of the conPicture #158 [images/img_0158.png]144tradictions in their fall force, and weigh them against each other, to obtainsynthetic results. By the process he follows, which is that of subjugating oneterm to the other, of sacrificing one term for the other, he arrives at nosynthesis whatever. The fact of like is essentially complex and synthetic; andit escapes Mr. Huxley’s investigations at every turn.Picture #159 [images/img_0159.png]NEW-ENGLANDTRANSCENDENTALISM.18145Picture #160 [images/img_0160.png]ToRALPH WALDO EMERSON jFoliobittg $age*ARE RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBEDBY THE AUTHOR.14TPicture #161 [images/img_0161.png]TEANSCENDENTALISM.Transcendentalism is that form of philosophy which sinks God and nature in man.God, man, and nature, in their relations (if indeed th8 absolute God may be saidevef to be in relations), are the objects of all philosophy; but, in differenttheories, greater or less prominence is given to one or the other of thesethree, and thus systems are formed. Pantheism sinks man and nature in God;materialism sinks God and man in the universe; transcendentalism sinks God andnature in man. In other words, some, in philosophizing, take their point ofdeparture in God alone,' and are inevitably conducted to pantheism ; others taketheir point of departure in nature alone, and are led to materialism; othersstart with man alone, and end in transcendentalism.It is by no means difficult to deny in words the actual existence of the outwarduniverse. I may say, for example, that the paper on which I write has no moreoutward existence than the thoughts I refrain from expressing. When I say Iperceive an outwardly existing tree, I may be mistaken: what I call18* 148Picture #162 [images/img_0162.png]ISOa tree may have no outward existence, but may, on the contrary, be created in myperception. Who knows that a thing which appears red to me may not appear blueto my neighbor? If so, then is color something which I lend to the object. Butwhy stop at color? Perhaps hardness and weight have no existence save that whichthe mind gives. 44 Whether Nature enjoy a substantial existence without,” saysMr. Emerson, — the profoundest metaphysician, after Jonathan Edwards, which thiscountry has ever produced, —44 or is only in the apocalypse of the mind, it isalike useful and alike venerable to me. Be it what it may, it is ideal to me solong as I cannot try the accuracy of m / senses.” 44 What differs it to me,” heasks on another page, 44 whether Orion be up there in heaven, or some god paintthe image in the firmament of the soul ? ”Fabre d’Olivet believed the outward universe to be so dependent upon theindividual soul, that we may properly be said to create it ourselves. He thoughtthat we ourselves produce all forms and the world, and that we may createwhatever we will, isolatedly and instantaneously. In truth, if all outwardthings depend for their being, and manner of existence, upon ourselves and uponour inward states, a change in those states involves a change in outward nature.If we discover, therefore, the connection of our thoughts and feelings withoutward nature, the whole universe is in our power; and we may, by amodification of ourselves, change the world from its present state into what weall wish it might become. This thought gives the foundation for a system ofmagic. Mr.Picture #163 [images/img_0163.png]151Alcott (an accomplished adept in pantheistic theosophy) thinks the world wouldbe what it ought to be were he only as holy as he should be: he also considershimself personally responsible for the obliquity of the earth’s axis. A frien 1once told me, while we watched large flakes of snow as they were slowly falling,that, could we but attain to the right spiritual attitude, we should be able tolook on outward nature, and say, “I snow, I rain.” In the eighth number of “ TheDial ” we find a beautiful poem touching upon this theory, from which we make anextract: —“ All is but as it seems, —The round, green earth,With river and glen;The din and mirth Of the busy, busy men;The world’s great fever,Throbbing forever:The creed of the sage,The hope of the age,All things we cherish,All that live and ail that perish, —These are dot inner dreams.The great world goeth on To thy dreaming;To thee aloneHearts are making their moan,Eyes are streaming.Thine is the white moon turning night to day; Thine is the dark wood sleeping inher ray;Thee the winter chills;Thee the spring-time thrills:All things nod to thee;All things come to secPicture #164 [images/img_0164.png]152If thou art dreaming on :If tht dream should break,And thou shouldst awake,All things would be gone.*Nothing is if thou art not.Thou art under, over all;Thou dost hold and cover all;Thou art Atlas, thou art Jove ;The mightiest truthHath all its youthFrom thy enveloping thought.”In this extract the poet makes man to be the only real existence, and outwardnature to be a mere phenomenon dependent upon him. Man is represented asexisting really, actually, absolutely; but nature as an accident, an appearance,a consequent upon the existence of the human soul. Thus is the universe sunk,swallowed up, in man. The concluding seven lines of the extract are an exampleof the transcendental theology, an example of the swallowing-up of God himselfin man.Materialism affirms that man is the result of organ• The following lines, from Shelley, are to the same point: —“ Earth and ocean.Space, and the isles of life and light that gem The sapphire floods ofinterstellar air;This firmament pavilioned upon chaos,Whose outwnll, bastioned impregnablyAgainst the escape of boldest thoughts, repels themAs Calpe the Atlantic clouds; this wholeOf suns and worlds and men and beasts and flowers,With all the silent or tempestuous workings By which they have been, are, orcease to be, —Is but a vision : all that it inheritsAre motes of a sick eye, bubbles, and dreams;Thought is its cradle and its grave.\"Picture #165 [images/img_0165.png]153ization, and denies the existence of separate and individual souls, thus sinkingman in nature: it also identifies God with the active powers of the universe. AsPantheism sinks man and nature in God, so materialism sinks God and man in theuniverse. Our transcendentalists are, by no means, always consistent. Sometimesthey express themselves la a way that leaves us in doubt whether they are not,at bottom, materialists. For example, the poem from which the foregoing extractsare quoted is followed by another, from the same author, but of clearly oppositetenor. We quote a few lines: —“ Dost thou dream that thou art free,Making, destroying all that thou dost see,In the unfettered might of thy soul’s liberty ?Lo! an atom crushes thee;One nerve tortures and maddens thee;One drop of blood is death to thee.The mighty voice of NatureIS THY PARENT, NOT THY CREATURE;Iff NO PUPIL, BUT THY TEACHER :And the world would still move on Were thy soul forever flown.For while thou dreamest on, infolded In Nature’s wide embrace,All thy life is daily moulded By her informing grace;And time and space must reign And rule o’er thee forever.And the outworld lift its chain From off thy spirit never.”Here the soul is evidently sunk in Nature : it is, to use a mathematicalexpression, considered as a funcPicture #166 [images/img_0166.png]164tion of the universe. — But we ought not to have separated these passages; forthe poet aims to show that transcendentalism and materialism, liberty andfatality, are two sides of one truth.Having spoken thus far of some of the peculiar characteristics of thetranscendental school oi philosophy, we shall now take occasion to say a fewwords concerning its origin and development. But here it will be necessary totreat of the philosophy of Kant, a subject not easily handled. The fundamentalpostulate of the philosopher of Konigsberg may, however, initiate the readerinto the whole system. Here it is, as near as we recollect it: —u If any truth be present to the mind with a conviction of its universality andnecessity, that truth was derived to the mind from its own operations, and doesnot rest upon observation and experience:“ And, conversely, if any truth be present to the mind with a conviction of itscontingency, that truth was derived to the mind from observation and experience,and not from the operations of the mind itself.”For example, we know that every effect must have its cause; and this truth liesin the mind with a conviction of its universality and necessity: this truth isderived, therefore, not from observation and experience, but from the operationsof the mind itself; it is born, not from outward nature, but in and from themind itself. In other words, to express ourselves after the manner of the Scotchschool, we are forced by the very constitution of our being to admit this truth;so that the recognition of the principle ofPicture #167 [images/img_0167.png]155causation may be said to be a law of our intellectual natures.On the other hand, we say, We know the sun will rise to-morrow; but we are notabsolutely certain of the fact. This second truth lies, therefore, in our minds,with a conviction of its contingency, and not of its necessity; and is,consequently, not derived from a law of our intellectual natures, but fromobservation and experience.By every fact of experience, a revelation is made to the soul, not only of theidea which it has appropriated to itself, but also of those conditions of theexternal world, and of its own nature, which rendered that acquisition possible.For example, when we perceive moonlight, it is necessary (1) that there shouldbe something out of us to produce the effect of moonlight upon our sensibility,and also (2) certain internal faculties which are responsive to the influencesof moonlight. Without the outward object there is no perception, and without theinward faculties there is likewise no perception: for the moon shines upon thetrees as well as upon me ; but the trees perceive nothing, being devoid of theperceiving faculty. Again: the idea I have of moonshine might have been made tobe other than it is by a change, either, first, in the outward object; or,second, in my perceiving faculty. Had the moonshine Jbeen different, it wouldhave produced a different effect upon my sensibility, and, consequently, theidea would have been different; had my perceiving faculty been different, theinfluence or effect of the moonshine would have been different, and the ideaPicture #168 [images/img_0168.png]156resulting would likewise have been different. All this is plain. Now, thefaculties of the mind are supposed to be permanent, and to always operate in thesame manner: therefore the truths given by the faculties, where nothing from theexternal word intervenes, are universal and necessary. But the outward world isgiven as always changing: therefore the truths given by observation andexperience alone, are always contingent. Perhaps we can make this plainer by anillustration.A nail-machine is composed of a pair of strong shears, which are made to dotheir work sometimes by steam, sometimes by water-power. A man stands before themachine, and inserts the end of an iron plate between the two blades of theshears when they open: when the shears shut, they cut off a nail from this plate; and this nail depends for its size and shape upon the form of the shears. Letus suppose the machine to be in operation, and the plate to be inserted. Themachine says, I perceive something hard, black, cold: what is this something Iperceive ? In answer, the shears close, and the nail is cut off, and rattlesaway into the box. Ah, ha! says the machine, I now begin to see into the mysteryof the impressions of which I was conscious a moment ago. It was a tenpenny-nailthat produced the impressions, — a long and four-sided substance, sharp at oneend, and flat at the other. By this time the shears close again; and the machinesays, Another tenpenny-nail, by all that is glorious ! This acquisition ofknowledge is beginning to be interesting. I must know a little more of thephilosophy ofPicture #169 [images/img_0169.png]167this business. So the machine goes on to soliloquize* Listen I —I have now, says the machine, in my experience, memoiy, or nail-box, severaltenpenny-nails. These were undoubtedly acquired from the external world, and areall that I have as yet acquired from that world. Therefore, if aught besidetenpennynails exist in the external world, I have no conception of suchexistence; and that world is, consequently, for me, a collection oftenpenny-nails. The following appear, therefore, to be unvarying laws of actualexistence: (1) All things are long and four-sided; and (.2) all things are sharpat one end, and flat at the other.But stop! says the machine—let us beware of hasty inductions. An idea strikesme! About these same nails: I am not so clear that they were not formed by theconcurrent action of two agents. Perhaps the material was furnished by externalnature; while the form resulted from the law of my nature, the constitution ofmy shears, of my own nail-making being. The following conclusion, at. least,cannot be • shaken: I may look upon every nail from two distinct points of view,— first as to its material, ^nd second as to its form. The material undoubtedlycomes from* without, and is variable: some nails are of brass, some are of iron;but the form is invariable, and comes from within. A11 my nails must be long andfour-sided, and that universally and necessarily; but the material may vary,being sometimes brass, sometimes iron. This is plain; for I acquire aH my nailsaccording to the law of my nail-making being,; uPicture #170 [images/img_0170.png]158is, translating from scientific into popular language, according to the form ofmy shears. After mature deliberation, I think I may take the following postulateas the foundation of all my ulterior philosophy:—Whatever I may find in my nail-box, whether nails or whatever else relating tonails, if I am convinced that it is what it is necessarily, and mast be as it isuniversally, that same thing, whatever it is, was not derived to my nail-boxfrom external nature, but finds the reason of its existence in the formation andshape of my shears:And, conversely, whatever I may find in that same nail-box, which is neithernecessary nor universal, but variable and contingent, has its origin, and thereason of its existence, not in the formation and shape of my shears, but in theexternal world.Having relieved itself of this postulate, the machine continues its meditationsin silence.The difference between the postulate of the nailmachine and that of theKonigsberg philosopher is by no means great. Let us use them both in endeavoringto get at clearer conceptions of the position of our transcendental friends.Do we not see all'material objects under the relations of space ? Is not space anecessary and universal form of all our sensible perceptions ? But what says thepostulate? The notion of space cannot come from the external world ; for, if itdid, it would not be attended with the conviction of universality and necessitywith which it is attended. The notion of space comes, then, from the mind, andnot at all from the outward world. (We speak as a Kantian.)Picture #171 [images/img_0171.png]Space, then, has no outward existence; and the supposition that it has is merehypothesis. We may treat time in the same manner; for time is the medium inwhich, universally and necessarily, we perceive events. Sensible objects andevents are the iron, brass, the material of ideas — space and time are the formimpressed by the shears. After all, what can we make of time and space ? Simplythis. Time and space are the intellectual spectacles through which we look onoutward nature: they have no outward existence, but are media, perhapsdistorting media, which we spread before our eyes whenever we look on theoutward. (We give the Kantian statement.) But if space and time are mere media,perhaps distorting media, through which we perceive outward nature, all oursensible perceptions may be erroneous; and, if no new method of acquiringknowledge can be discovered, we may as well doubt of every thing. What shall wedo, then ? This is the question asked by several of our transcendentalists. Thefirst course which presents itself to the mind is that of endeavoring toeliminate the elements of space and time from all our perceptions: but this isevidently impossible; for perception, divested of its form, becomes noperception at all, and vanishes. Space and time must, therefore, be transcended.To follow a transcendental writer, we must not endeavor to find the logicalconnection of his sentences; for there is no such logical connection, and thewriter himself never intended there should be. Many transcendental compositionsread better backwards than they do forwards. We ought rather toPicture #172 [images/img_0172.png]160transcend space and time (if indeed we can), and follow the writer there. Atranscendentalist never reasons: he describes what he sees from his own point ofview. So the word 44 transcendentalism ” relates not so much to a system ofdoctrines as it does to a point of view; from which, nevertheless, a system ofdoctrines may be visible. This explains to us why so many, notwithstanding theirdesire, have been unable to read the writings of the new school. They have triedto find a system of doctrines where they ought to have looked for a point ofview.But to return to our postulate. We see every thing as existing under the law ofcause and effect. The fact of causation is universal and necessary; for everyfact of experience gives us, on one side, its material, which come3 from theout-world; and, on the other, its form, which comes always, in part, from thelaw of causation. Let the reader turn for a moment to the postulate of thenail-machine. He will find that every truth which lies in the mind with aconviction of its universality and necessity is derived to the mind from its ownoperations, and that it does not rest at all on observation and experience. Butdoes not the truth, that every effect must have its cause, lie in the mind witha conviction of its universality and necessity ? The consequence is clear. Thelaw of causation is a distorting medium through which we look upon theout-world; and we have no legitimate authority for affirming that the externalworld is in any way subjected to that law. It is true that we are forced to lookupon nature under that relation ; but the necessity of the case arises, not fromPicture #173 [images/img_0173.png]the fact of the reality of the law of causation (we speak as a Kantian), butfrom the constitution of our nature. But here all positive knowledge isannihilated. An idea is good and valid, if we may have any confidence in theseforms of the soul; but what is the relation of the form of the shears to theoutward object independent of the machine ? Who shall infer from the inward tothe outward ?The system of Kant is one vast scepticism : admit the fatal postulate, and thereis no dodging the conclusion. Our transcendentalists have not been unfaithful tothe thought of their master. They mend the theory of Kant by carrying it out,and affirming (with the master) that the form of thought, and (against themaster) that the thing thought of, are both of inward (subjective) origin.Transcendentalism affirms that the soul creates all things, — man, the universe,all forms, all changes, — and that this wonderful power is possessed by eachindividual soul. But it may be asked, Will there not, then, be necessarily aconfusion, a mixture of universes, arising from the conflict of the creativeenergies of distinct souls ? This difficulty may be made to vanish. Suppose, fora moment, that I have a magical power over some great public building, — theCity Hall, for example ; suppose every one of its parts, by a pre-existingharmony, to be made obedient to my will, so that when I will the windows to openand shut, the doors to turn on their hinges, &c., they immediately do it: wouldnot this City Hall, thus immediately obedient to my will, be a new body withwhich I am invested ? Suppose I have powerPicture #174 [images/img_0174.png]162over a dog in the moon, so that he barks, runs, wags his tail, according to theaction of my will: am I not existing “in this dim spot which men call earth,”and also, at the same time, in u the orbed maiden whom mortals call the moon ” ?In the first case, I exist as a man; in the second, as an animal of the caninespecies. Without doubt, I may have millions of bodies; there is no difficulty inthe matter: all that I operate upon by immediate magical power, by magia, to usethe phrase of Jacob Behmen, is to me a body. So I may be in this world a man,and in the moon a dog: yet am I not two,but one; for one soul animates the twobodies. But mark! While I am immersed in things of time and sense, paying noregard to the soul, which is under and behind all, I think the man who is nowmoving about, trading and travelling on earth, to be myself ; and only afterdeep thought, fasting, and meditation, do I find that I am also a dog. But heremysteries thicken. I am not only both a man and a dog: I am also neither a mannor a dog; for I am the soul that speaks through both. “ What we commonly callman,” says Mr. Emerson, “ the eating, drinking, planting, counting man, doesnot, as we know him, represent himself, but misrepresents himself. Him we do notrespect; but the soul; whose organ he is, would he let it appear through hisaction, would make our knees bend.” The man, therefore, who has attained toright knowledge, is aware that there is no such thing as an individual soul.There is but one soul, which is the “ Over^Soul; ” and this one Soul is theanimating principle of all bodies. When I am thoughtless,Picture #175 [images/img_0175.png]168and immersed in things which are seen, I mistake the person who is now writingthese sentences for myself: but, when 1 am wise, this illusion vanishes like themists of the morning; and then I know that what I thought to be myself was onlyone of my manifestations, only a mode of my existence. It is I who bark in thedog, grow in the tree, and murmur in the passing brook. Think not, my brother,that thou art diverse and alien from myself; it is only while ■we dwell in theoutward appearance that we are two: when we consider the depths of our being, weare found to be the same; for the same self, the same vital principle, animatesus both. (We speak as a transcendentalist.) I create the universe; and thoualso, my brother, createst the same ; for we create, not two universes, but one;for we two have but one soul: there is but one creative energy,- which is above,and under, and through all.This is no new theory. This doctrine was well known in the East before historybegan. No man can tell when it arose; for it is, perhaps, as old as thoughtitself. “Rich,” say the Vedas, “is that universal self whom thou worshippest asthe soul.” We should strive, therefore, to disentangle ourselves from the worldof matter, from the bonds of time and space, that we may take our stand at oncein the “OverSoul,” which we are, did we but know it. We are the Oversold; and wecome to our own native home when we attain to our true point of view, where thewhole universe is seen to be our body. Then do we know of a -truth that it is wewho think, love, laugh, bark, growl, run, crawl, rain, snow, &c., Ac. Mr.Picture #176 [images/img_0176.png]164Emerson has given a beautiful expression to this thought:—u There is no great and no small To the Soul that maketh all:And, where it cometh, all things are;And it cometh everywhere.\"44 There is one mind,” says Mr. Emerson in his Essay on History, 44 common toall individual men. Every man is an inlet to the same, and to all of the same.He that is once admitted to the right of reason is made a freeman of the wholeestate. What Plato has thought, he may think; what a saint has felt, he mayfeel; what at any time has befallen any man, he can understand. Who hath accessto this universal Mind is a party to all that is or can be done; for this is theonly and sovereign Agent.”It may easily be seen that this amounts to an identification of man with God.Yet this system is by no means pantheistic: perhaps, indeed, we may be permittedto coin a new term, and call it human pantheism. Pantheism sinks man in God, —makes him to be a phenomenon of the divine existence; but this system, so farfrom being an absorption of humanity in God, is an absorption of God in thehuman soul. A pantheistic friend once explained to me the difference between hissystem and that of the transcendentalists. 441 hold myself,” he said, 44 to be aleaf, blown about by the winds of change and circumstance, and holding to theextreme end of one of the branches of the tree * of universal existence ; butthese gentlemen (referring to the transcendentalists) think themselves to besome of the sap”Picture #177 [images/img_0177.png]165Let us go up higher, and examine this doctrine as it manifested itself in theOriental world; let us examine it in its bearings upon the problem of the soul’sfuture existence. It is written in the Vedas,44 The soul should be known; thatis, it should be distinguished from Nature: for then it will not return; it willnot return.” In this passage, under a form peculiar to the East, we find theenunciation of one of the fundamental problems of philosophy (that of theimmortality of the soul) with the indication of a solution'. It is the generalbelief of the Orientals, that the soul of a dying man, after leaving thispresent body, will be born again into the world under some new form. A man, inhis next body, may be a man, a horse, or a dog; and this re-birth, whether inthe old or under a new form, is the return of the soul. The expiation of certaincrimes consists, according to the description in the laws of Menu, in the soul’sliving a thousand successive lives in the bodies of a thousand differentspiders. The prospect, therefore, is by no means agreeable; and we cannot wonderthat the whole force of the Oriental mind should have been directed to thediscovery of some means whereby the return of the soul might be avoided.In all ages of the world there have been philosophers who held that the soulbuilds the body ; that is* that the character and form of the body are dependenton the character of the soul. The diametrically opposite doctrine is, indeed,more fashionable at this time: for many of our phrenologists and othermaterialists believe that it is the body which builds the soul; that is, thatthe soul is a function of (dependPicture #178 [images/img_0178.png]166ent upon) some portion of the organism, — say the brain, for example. An appealis made, in both cases, to observation and experience. The phrenologist, from anexamination of the skull, will give a pretty shrewd guess as to the character ofits owner: the idealist, on the contrary, will call our attention to the factthat the indulgence of certain passions alters the conformation of the face andthe expression of the figure. The idealist says, that the man who acquires thedisposition of a fox will begin to look like a fox; will begin to become a foxas far as such a transformation is compatible with human nature. It is in thenature of spirit, says the idealist, to express itself in some form; and, as weare all rendered free at death, why should we not, in the next birth, take the.form best adapted to express our inward natures? Why should not the man who is,in heart, a fox, take in the next birth the outward form of a fox ? Why shouldnot a fierce, bloody man be born the next time as a bull-dog? and a woman, whohas no desire except for dress and display, be bom as a peacock ? Are theirsouls immortal ? Yea, perhaps; but their present desires may remain with them,for their happiness or misery, throughout eternity. Conversely, a man of pureand angelic character begins inevitably to present a pure and angelicappearance; the countenance becomes placid, the manner sedate; and the soul ofthe man transforms'his body till it becomes as angelic as is compatible with itspresent relations: and, when it assumes a new form after death, what shallprevent it from assuming the one most appropri ate to its nature ?Picture #179 [images/img_0179.png]167Oar transcendentalists hold, not only that the soul builds the body, but that itbuilds all things, — God, the universe, other men, &c. “In the order ofthought,” says Mr. Emerson, “ the materialist takes his departure from theexternal world, and esteems a man as one product of that. The idealist takes hisdeparture from his consciousness, and reckons the world as an appearance. . . .The experience of the idealist inclines him to behold the procession of factsyou call the world as flowing perpetually outward from an invisible unsoundedcentre in himself, centre alike of him and of them, and necessitating him toregard all things as having a subjective or relative value, relative to thataforesaid unknown centre of Aim.” A little thought will convince the reader thatthe theory, that the soul builds the body, is as plausible and as probable asthe other doctrine, that the body builds the soul. In short, subjective-idealismis just as true as materialism; and we may add, just as false. As is evident, ifwe start with man alone, our reasonings will leave us, at the end, intranscendentalism (subjective-idealism) ; and, if we take our departure innature alone, we end, of necessity, in materialism; both partial, exclusive, andinadequate systems. The fact is, the body builds the soul, and the soul buildsthe body; but (we will permit ourselves to add) it is God who builds both.What reasoning, what train of thought, lay in the minds of the writers of theVedas when they explained the method to be followed by men desirous of avoidinga return into this evil mansion of pain ? Why did they suppose that adistinction of the soulPicture #180 [images/img_0180.png]168from Nature, by the exercise of thought, would be sufficient to overcome thenecessity for a return t We will endeavor to give an answer to these questions.But it will be necessary to explain beforehand some of the peculiarities of theOriental philosophy, and to fix the meaning of several unusual terms andphrases, in order that the reader may readily understand the somewhat obscuretexts we shall find it necessary to quote. By means of these definitions, wetrust we shall be able to set forth in a dear light the true nature both oftranscendentalism and of Aryan Orientalism, and also to show that the two arereally one.The invisible world, or world of potential existences, of the Orientals, isprecisely what Jacob Behmen, John Pordage, the Gnostics, and other Westerntheosophists, designate as the abyss. Now, in order to describe or illustratethe meaning of the words, the abyss, or the thing they designate, we must haverecourse to the reader’s own imagination ; for the transcendental philosophyproceeds from within outwards, from the thought and imagination to the existingfact, and not conversely. Let the reader, therefore, suppose, in thought, thisvisible universe to; be broken. Let all the qualities by which we distinguishthe differences subsisting among the different bodies of Nature be imagined asceasing to manifest themselves. Let all properties, all activities in Nature, befigured as re-entering into themselves. Let all that by which each manifests itsown proper, existence fall back into the virtual state, so that all properties,all activities, exist no longer in act, but only in the powerPicture #181 [images/img_0181.png]169of acting. Like a circle that contracts more and more till it vanishes in itsown centre, let all extensions contract into — into what, O ye Powers! Let allqualities derived from extension, or which are manifested to us throughextension, enter again into themselves. Let, in short, all properties of thingsbe only in potentiality * of manifestation. When all outward things are thusconceived as existing in potentiality of manifestation, man also must beconceived as having ceased from all actual existence,! and must be figured (iffigured at all) as having re-entered the potential state. In fact, how does manact ? how does he manifest himself ? He moves, eats, drinks, thinks, wills,remembers, hopes, loves, desires, &c. But can a man eat without eatingsomething? or can he drink* What is potential existence? What is actual existence? What is the differencebetween potential and actual existence ? A thing exists potentially, orinpotentia, when it is possible only. This same thing exists actually when ithas not only this possible (potential) existence, but also a real existence s»act.f What is the difference in signification between the terms essence andexistence? Essence is pure being, without efflux or manifestation. Existenceinvolves outgoing, or manifestation. The soul of man, and every other substance,according to the foundation of its being, according to its centre or root, is;but according to its outgoings, manifestations, or operations, it exists. Athing is when in potentia, or when possessing only a possible existence ; but itexists when it has not only its root of substance or being, but also an actualmanifestation.The foregoing definition of the word essence is the one given by Swedenborg, theGnostics, and other theosophers, and is not at all the same with the one givenby the schoolmen. The scholastic definition of the term, the one adopted bySpinoza, who scorns the gnosis, is as follows: —Essence is that without which a particular thing oannot be what it is. A dockand a turnspit may be constructed of like materials; but it is essential to aclock that it should mark the regular divisions of time: if a clock lose itscapability of keeping time, it ceases to be quoad clock, although it may stm beutilized for communicating an irregular movement of rotation.ISPicture #182 [images/img_0182.png]170if he do not drink something ? Can he move without moving through some space, ormoving something; viz., his body? Can he love, hope, desire, think, withoutthinking, hoping, loving, desiring something ? When all things are in thepotential state, this something, which is necessary to all his actions, iswithdrawn : and, as man cannot act or manifest himself without the concurrenceof this something, he must also himself cease from all action, allmanifestation; he must himself, in like manner, re-enter the potential state.Conceive, if you can, that you are removed in some distant region of space wherenothing can come into contact with you; where the light of the stars of heavenis extinguished; where the undulations of the all-pervading ether cease tooperate; where all motion, all change, all springing sources, have re-enteredinto themselves: conceive, also, your memory to be so‘blotted out that thevoices of the past sound no longer: conceive that no fact remains present to themind on which to base an inference in regard to the future. Would you live, act,think, or desire ? Of what would you think ? or what would you desire ? Allthese objects of thought and desire have entered, according to the supposition,into the potential state, and manifest themselves no longer to you. Evidentlyyou have entered, as far as is possible this side the gates of death, into thepotential state, into the invisible world, into the abyss.When we thus conceive this universe to be broken, to have returned into itsoriginal essence, but non-existence ; when we conceive man also to have ceasedfrom all actual existence, — we shall perceive all ourPicture #183 [images/img_0183.png]171representations, humanity, the outward world, ourselves, all thought, alldesire, re-entering into each other, so as to exist thenceforth only in germ,only in potentiality of existence. Man and the universe will be effacedtogether; all things will enter the potential state simultaneously: for thehuman intelligence reflects the universe; and the re-entering of the universeinto the potential state will be marked by the smooth surface of the mirror (themind of man), which gives thenceforth no reflection, which marks thenceforth nochange.Thus beings become one being in potentiality of manifestation. Yet, wh$n we sayone being, our words must not be taken with too much strictness. Nature and manhave re-entered into themselves, and all things exist only in potentia: theyhave become one being, insomuch as each is now a cause existing in potentialityof operation; one being, inasmuch as these causes are undistinguishable the onefrom theother, since all that can effect a distinction is swal■lowed up in the abyss of potentiality. But they are many beings, insomuch asthey are the potentiality of a world involving diversity and change.This one being, this world in potentia, is the abyss of Jacob Behmen, theinvisible world of the Orientals.“I am,” says Kreeshna in the Bhagvat Geeta, “that which is the seed of allthings in nature; and there is nothing, whether animate or inanimate, which iswithout me. But what, 0 Arjoon ! hast thou to do with this manifold wisdom ? Iplanted the universe with a single portion, and stood still. [The son of Pandoothen beheld within the mighty compound being, within the body of the God ofgods, standing together, the whole universe, dividedPicture #184 [images/img_0184.png]172forth into its vast variety.] I see thyself says Arjoon, on all sides, ofinfinite shape, formed with abundant arms and bellies and mouths and eyes; but Ican neither discover thy beginning, thy middle, nor again thy end, O universalLord, form of the universe I”The following extract from the Laws of Menu is clear, and shows the distinctionbetween the potential and actual worlds; the first being the substance and seedof the latter, and the latter being the former drawn out into actual relations:—“ They who are acquainted with day and night know that a day of Brahma is athousand revolutions of the Yoogs, and that his night extendeth for a thousandmore. On the coming-forth of that day, all things proceed from invisibility tovisibility: so, on the approach of night, they are all dissolved away into thatwhich is called invisible. The universe even, having existed, is again dissolved; and now again, on the approach of day, by divine necessity, it is reproduced.That which, upon the dissolution of all things else, is not destroyed, issuperior and of another nature from that visibility: it is invisible andeternal. He who is thus called Invisi HU and Incorruptible is even hp who iscalled the Supreme Abode ; which men, having once obtained, they never morereturn to the earth: that is my mansion. That Supreme Being is to be obtained byhim that worshippeth no other gods. In him is included all Nature; by him allthings are spread abroad.”We give a few more extracts from the “ Bhagvat Geeta: ” —\" Tk® great Brahm,” says Kreeshna, u is my womb. In it I place my foetus, andfrom it is the production of all Nature. ... I am generation and dissolution;the place where all things are reposited, and the inexhaustible seed of allNature. I am sunshine, and I am rain. I now draw in, and I now let out. I am-death and immortality. I am entity and non-entity. . . . The ignorant,Picture #185 [images/img_0185.png]178being unacquainted with my supreme nature, which is superior to all things, andexempt from decay, believe me, who am invisible, to exist in the visible formunder which they see me. ... I am the creation and the dissolution of the wholeuniverse. There is not any thing greater than I; and all things hang on me, evenas precious gems on a string. I am moisture in the water, light in the sun andmoon, invocation in the Vedas, sound in the firmament, human nature in mankind.In all things I am life, and I am zeal in the zealous; and know, O Aijoon 1 thatI am the eternal seed of all Nature. ... I will now tell thee what is Gnea, orthe object of wisdom ; from which understanding thou wilt enjoy immortality.This is that which has no beginning, and is separate, even Brahm, who canneither be called sat (ens) nor asat (non-ens). Unattached, it containeth allthings; and, without quality, it partaketh of every quality. It is undivided;yet in all things it standeth divided. It is wisdom, — that which is the objectof wisdom, and that which is to be obtained by wisdom.**We may illustrate this doctrine still further by commenting on the followingextract from Dupuis, That author says,—“ Amid the shadows of a dark night, when the heavens are covered with a thickcloud, when all bodies have disappeared from our eyes, and we seem to dwellalone with ourselves and with the black shadows which surround us, what is thenthe measure of our existence ? How much does it differ from an entireannihilation, especially when memory and thought do not surround us with theimages of objects which the day revealed to us ? Allis dead to us ; and weourselves are, in a certain manner, dead to Nature. What can give us life, anddraw our soul from this mortal weakness which chains down its activity in theshadows of chaos ? A single ray of light can restore us to ourselves, and toNature, which seemed so far removed from us. Behold the principle of our trueexistence, without which our life would be but the sentiment of a prolongedennui It is this need of light, it is its creative energy, which has been feltby all men; for they have seen nothing more is*Picture #186 [images/img_0186.png]174frightftil than its absence. Behold their first Divinity, whose brilliantsplendor, sparkling forth from the bosom of chaos, caused to proceed thence manand the universe, according to the theological principles of Orpheus and ofMoses.”The thought here expressed is simple; but its power is inexhaustible. We neednot dwell on the view of the nature of life which is so clearly and beautifullyexpressed; for we shall have much to say of it hereafter. But we would askDupuis, Is there nothing but light which can expel this obscure gloom ? is therenothing but light which can deliver man from this nugatory abyss of potentialexistence? How much is involved in the expression,44 especially when memory andthought do not surround us with the images of objects which the day revealed tous ” ? A single ray of light would indeed restore us to reality;' to communionwith nature; but would not the remembrance of a single object seen in the dayawaken the soul to a real life, though not to an immediate communion with nature? While we are in this state of darkness and of silence, this state of dreamingwithout dreams, the whole expanse, if we may so speak, of memory, is spreadbefore the inner eye, but without form, and, as it were, void. No distinct imageis present to the mind; and all our conceptions lie in the memory andimagination (which is another form, or rather a modification of memory), in themere potentiality of existence as actual conceptions. If we begin to actmentally, if we begin to form to ourselves a picture or conception, the facts ofmemory rise up before us; and, taking the isolated parts, we bring themtogether, —perhaps in new forms by thePicture #187 [images/img_0187.png]175exercise of imagination, perhaps in the reproduction of some well-knowncollocation by the exercise of simple memory.This vast and apparently empty (as in the case supposed by Dupuis) expanse ofmemory, which stretches out before the inward eye when we seem to cease from allthought, is as the invisible or potential world, as the abyss. This emptyexpanse, containing the germ of all our conceptions, is a similitude, acorrespondency, of the invisible world of the Orientals. But the invisible worldis the seed of all nature; while the vacant expanse, or world, of memory andimagination, is finite, and the seed of the conceptions of the individual manonly. The whole universe is contained, in potentia, in the abyss: in likemanner, in this field of memory are contained potentially all those elementswhich go to make up the conceptions formed by the mind when it enters intooperation.According to the Oriental theology as perfected by Sakyamuni (and Buddhism isthe only Indian doctrine that has profoundly influenced the current of thoughtin Western Asia and in Europe), a man must, in this world, crucify everyaffection, every tendency, and endeavor to be, at the moment of death, in thestate described in the quotation from Dupuis: thus, and thus only, can he escapethe return, the necessity of transmigrating. “ At the end of life,” saysKreeshna, who is the Abyss, “ he who, having abandoned his mortal frame,departeth thinking only of me, without doubt goeth unto me ; or else, if hethink not of me, but of other things, whatever nature he shall thus call upon atthe end of life, whenPicture #188 [images/img_0188.png]176he shall quit his mortal frame, he shall go into it ” When a man dies who iswithout affection, whose mind is fixed upon the Abyss, upon the universal unityof indifference, he will not take any form (for he has no particular characteror tendency), but will at once enter into the potential state. But thisreentrance into the potential state seems to be annihilation (though the essenceof the soul subsists) rather than immortality. Kreeshna is the Abyss; and thehighest state of future happiness held out by the “ Bhagvat Geeta ” consists ina return into Kreeshna. In this state of essence without existence we shouldindeed be free from the danger of migration, for we should be thenceforth freefrom all relations whatever ; but no future life is compatible with such anorder of being. We should like to know how our transcendentalists answer theobjections brought against the doctrine of the “ Bhagvat Geeta.” Their wholedesire is to re-enter into themselves; to be absolved from all dependency uponany thing which is not themselves. How do they escape the Abyss ? How do theyavoid a return into Kreeshna, into “ the Supreme Abode ” ? Their only argumentfor immortality is the metaphysical one, derived from the fact of the soul’ssimplicity: but this proves only that the soul’s being is imperishable; itproves nothing in relation to a future life.Here are some intimations of the rule of conduct which ought to be followed bythe aspirant after immersion in Kreeshna: —“ Those men of regulated lives,” says Kreeshna, “ whose sins are done away,being freed from contending passions, enjoy me*Picture #189 [images/img_0189.png]177• • . He, O Aijoon f who, from conviction, acknowledgeth my divine birth andactions, doth not, upon his quitting his mortal frame, enter into another; forhe enterelh into me. . . . They who serve me with adoration, I am in them, andthey in me.* . . . Wise men who have abandoned all thought of the fruit which isproduced from their actions are freed from the chains of birth, and go to theregions of eternal happiness. ... A man is said to be confirmed in wisdom whenhe forsaketh every desire which entereth into his heart, and of himself ishappy, and contented in himself. . . . The wisdom of that man is established,who, in all things, is without affection; and, having received either good orevil, neither rejoiceth at the one, nor is cast down by the other. His wisdom isconfirmed, when, like a tortoise, he can draw in all his members, and restrainthem from their wonted purposes. The hungry man loseth every object but thegratification of his appetite ; and, when he is become acquainted with theSupreme, he loseth even that. • . . The man whose passions enter his heart asthe waters run into the unswelling, passive ocean, obtaineth happiness. . . .The man whose mind is led astray by the pride of self-sufficiency thinketh thathe himself is the executor of all those actions which are performed by theprinciples of his constitution; but the man who is acquainted with the twodistinctions of cause and effect will give himself no trouble. . . . The manwho, employed in the practice of works, is of a purified soul and a subduedspirit, and whose soul is the universal soul, is not (injuriously) affected byso being.”* See St John’s Gospel, ch. xiv. 20, and ch. xvii. 21. Recent investigatorsprofess themselves able to show that the Bhagvat Geeta is of much later originthan has heretofore been supposed. It appears, now, to be probable, not that thewriters of tho New Testament were influenced by the Bhagvat Geeta, but that thewriter of the Bhagvat Geeta was influenced (not in this passage only, but inmany others) by the style of St John’s Gospel. The substance, however, of thephilosophic doctrines of the Bhagvat Geeta may be traced back among theBuddhists, to a date mare than seven hundred years before the coming of ourLord.This pamphlet was written in 1845 or 1846; and the author, at that time, mpposedthe Bhagvat Geeta to be a very ancient book.Picture #190 [images/img_0190.png]Picture #191 [images/img_0191.png]178u lids whole world was spread abroad by me,” says Kreeshna, u in my invisibleform. All things depend on me, and I am not dependent upon them. Behold mydivine connection. My creative spirit is the keeper of all things, not thedependent. Understand that all things rest in me, as the mighty air, whichpasseth everywhere, resteth in the ethereal space. At the end of the formation,at the end of the day of Brahma, all things, 0 son of Koontee 1 return into myprimordial source; and, at the beginning of another formation, I create them allagain. I plant myself in my own virtue, and create, again and again, thisassemblage of beings, this whole, from the power of Nature without power. Thoseworks confine not me; because I am like one that sitteth aloof, uninterested inthose works. By my supervision, Nature produceth both the movable and theimmovable. It is from this source, O Aijoon! that the universe resolveth.”Buddhism, as it seems to us, is the true conclusion, .and the logicalhalting-place, for all these speculations. The Buddhists teach that the universeis brought into the possession of such existence as it has through thedisintegration of the Aboriginal Nothing by means of another subsequent nothing.The first Nothing is the Abyss of potentiality: the subsequent nothing is error.The world commences by the fact that essences lost in the indifference of merepotential being, become deluded into a belief of their own and each other’sexistence. Their error gradually becomes stronger and stronger; and at the sametime, by reason of their error, the universe appears to thicken and hardenlittle by little, and to seemingly pass into actuality. But this actuality isnot reality; it is mere grossness of error; it is mat/a, illusion. The universeis nothing. Man’s body, and the worlds, exist only in erroneous supposition. Thereality ofPicture #192 [images/img_0192.png]179the worlds is only such as is given in the formula, actuality = 0x0. Evil,sorrow, and pain have their abiding-place nowhere but in actual worlds. Theactual universe is therefore the substance of evil, if evil can properly be saidto have any substance. The way of salvation is therefore plain. It is the pathof knowledge; for knowledge destroys error, and, consequently, the visibleuniverse which is founded in error, as light dispels darkness. The perception ofvisible things is a mistaken prejudice, bred from unreasoning habit. As manprogresses in knowledge, error diminishes, and the world and himself recedetowards potential existence ; and, when man becomes perfect in knowledge, erroris abolished, and man, and the world so far as it concerns man, re-enter theabyss together, and cease to exist.The Buddhists designate the original nothing by the word nirvana: va, to blow;nir, out. The soul attains beatitude when it reaches nirvana; when it becomeslike the flame of a candle that has been blown out; when it becomes defunct,extinct, nothing. It comes from nothing, it is nothing, and it goes to nothing.We have nothing to say in praise or dispraise of Buddhism; but we will concludeour remarks by observing that its doctrines, though transcendently spiritual,are not at all the Christian doctrines which proclaim the existence of a livingGod, and a future of eternal life for the human soul, but, on the contrary,their distinct negation.It is estimated that there are in the world more than three hundred and fifteenmillion adherents ofPicture #193 [images/img_0193.png]180the Buddhist faith: the Christians, counting all denominations, are supposed tonumber less than half as many. Buddhism is the religion of the vast countriesbetween the Himalaya Mountains and the boundaries of Siberia, of the majority ofthe people in the great empire of China, the religion of the empire and peopleof Japan, of the States in and near the peninsula of Farther India, and of manyof the islands south and east of Farther India. It is hard to believe that themost widely diffused religion in the world, and the one which, afterChristianity, is the most spiritual of any, the most favorable to civilization,the most effectually moral, and the one that has awakened in its missionariesthe greatest enthusiasm, followed by the greatest amount of self-denial andself-sacrifice, is a religion professedly founded on speculative atheism; butsuch appears to be the established fact.The Buddhist theory denies that there is any true God other than the impersonalaboriginal Abyss which is the one ground of all visible things. Thecounter-theory affirms the self-consciousness of the Supreme, and teaches thatthe personality of God is a necessary condition, without which the Abyss cannotbe. Shall He who is the author of all consciousness, and of all life, be Himselfdevoid of self-consciousness, and not alive!Picture #194 [images/img_0194.png]Picture #195 [images/img_0195.png]"}]
