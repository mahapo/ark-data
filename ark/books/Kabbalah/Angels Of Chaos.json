This approach is even subject to it’s own nature. According to Liber CHRNZN, to achieve the ecstasy of heaven one should violate the violate. One of the advantages of the chaos magical standpoint lies in it’s paradigm shifting. Please note now that this perspective is a paradigm in and of itself (other perspectives are possible of course). The current view expressed is to be viewed as the commonly accepted filter for interpretation. How this shifting is viewed is up to the personal magicians tastes, but I have found that ‘Chaos Magick’ concerns itself with something which underlies all of the filters of existence. In chaos, all is possible, including nothing. Apparent duality’s can be split-up and torn apart, fractalized meshed and fused together in myriad ways. Much in the same way matter/ anti- matter reactions give rise to huge amounts of liberated energy, this way can liberate enormous amounts of belief. Duality can be expressed as the equation 0=2 or the nominal “truth” of duality manifesting from Nothing. We shall explore this concept which permeates human existence, much in the same way which one sees oneself as standing between two mirrors. It gets more clear as you look slightly askew and can see reflections bending to infinity hyperbolically.

Let me present how I have come to glimpse at the madness of truth through chaos magick. Truth and non- truth to the mind dealing in the dual are, and can be used as tools for various forms of manipulation. There is an underlying factor in all of THIS (Reality), which is the truth which underlies these tools (beliefs) which we use. This is not true in an absolute sense, but true in probabilities (note any possible contradictions). There are a few Laws of Chaos which I want you to keep at the fore front of your consciousness throughout the remainder of this essay: Elijah’s Law - You shall know truth by it’s paradox. Godel’s Law - There are no absolutes (this law is false) Grendel’s Law - There is no limit to desire other than desires needs. I hope the meaning of this introduction will become more clear as I approach the concept known as knowledge and conversation of the holy guardian angel, from the ‘chaotic perspective’ outlined above all in the light (and dark) of truth."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"1 Theory “In a way it’s all, a matter of time, I will not worry for you, you’ll be just fine, take my thoughts with you and when you look behind, you will surely see a face that you recognize.

Before doing so I would like to recant a brief history of the origins of the HGA as I have come to know them. [*1 For a more detailed account and the historical manuscripts please refer to: The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage , translated by S.L. Macgregor Mathers; Dover books] A long time ago in a land far-far away there was a mage who sought out God and more specifically God’s way (magick) in the world. He searched the world and found tricksters and black magicians, but none of these satisfied his quest for meaning and truth [No duhh ]. One day in his later years he ran across a mage living in isolation named Abramelin. This guy seemed to be in contact with some real truth here and initiated our wandering seeker with secrets of the quabalah, and a type of “sacred magic” for achieving contact with the Angel (in relation to the most high). The full details of this sojourn are detailed in the first chapter the sacred magick (*1). A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 gives the mind set to adopt and prayer-form rituals (which obviously must be personalized to the magician using them). The Third chapter gives other magic’s to poke around with (such as summoning an army to do your bidding...?) Anyway, it is a good book and I suggest you read it, along with this text. In the latter part of this essay I present Grendel’s Had an Accident and the Rite of Godhood as well as the collective bindings/ initiations called the Rite of Suffering as my own version of this Operation (in extension). A little Theory Based upon my Song of Illusion. • The HGA is a manifestation from probable time, of the Self (distinguished from the self) in unity and perfection of it’s will. • The HGA is a reflection of perfection of the Magus. Unity is desired to align more fully with the Will. [I shall not touch upon the “ black ” or “ white ” brotherhood, and shall talk more fully of something called the Scarlet brotherhood]. There is another aspect of the Angel which is a reflection across the tree of life into the tree of Death, this is a ‘natural’ course, as every action includes it’s inverse."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" • The HGA is also an independent being. • As the HGA is partly an astral construct of which energy (prayer-form) is devoted to allow for manifestation. • The Angel has access to knowledge (both mundane and magical) that is currently beyond the magicians scope and can reveal all manner of things. • There is a Self which underlies self and transcends the temporary ego manifestation of the magician. This ego is a mask of the Self (aka Kia, shhh). The ego is of the Self and by the Self. Identification is both the key and the cage here. • Thee Angel is the thin silver cord of the Horizon; demarcation ZOS-KIA. The Angels unity with CHRNZN is explosion of duality to a continuous transformation. See also Appendix VI. • Subscribing to all of the above can be of great benefit to the magician because it offers him/ her a handle in the formulation/ invocation of the Angel, as well as a magnificent channel with which to learn, grow and explore the infinite worlds and beyond. When faced with nothing, One had better well do something! A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"A side note on dangers. Any invocations and interaction with the outer-spaces should not be under taken at least until after initial contact with the angel is established. And definitely not in the demonic bindings phase. Why is this the case? It seems that the pathways extending through non-existence, also called the Tunnels of Set are filled with all manner of energies that can drive an organism completely insane at best. Thee Angel acts as a buffer zone for these experiences &/or guides the magus in explorations.

For in his games, he fools the very universe.” - Frater Halucifuge ’99 Let me start with how this all came about... It was some time ago that I was involved in a relationship. I will not bother you with the details but it is necessary to explain that I had a great deal of emotional attachment. Anyway, something happened in that relationship at the time which was so completely out of the blue, and un-expected, that it shook me to the core of my being {an event which is not out of the range of human potential but was emotionally catastrophic due to a lifetime of programming}. Basically shredding my Heart and needless to say my world was shattered.{Flash to a sequence with Elijah Forlorn on the Dance Floor, and the synchronous words ringing out, “I feel like I’m going crazy... I feel like I’m going insane....” (*a)} Being the opportunist magician that I am, I decided to try some experiments over the next few days using the great deal of emotional turmoil that I was in. I opted to try the neither-neither technique of AOS. I took the images and profundity of Love, my love, in the highest state of adoration and joy and ‘fused’ it with that of it’s perverted form.

Not only did the pain cease, but the liberated free belief (energy) acted as a conduit for something more. Something (which I would realize later), that has been with me my entire existence! I was entranced, and began writing. I wrote Grendel’s had an Accident and did not quite understand what I wrote at the time. I also found that by dredging up the memory of that night, this brought renewed turmoil, which allowed me to nullify it yet again. I was intoxicated for weeks. [This memory was eventually exhausted, by this technique] Coincidentally at this time also, I was to undergo initiation into the Autonomatrix, and had to write an initiation ritual. I channeled all of the energy I had into this rite, called the Rite of GODHOOD (ROG). Ever since Grendel’s had an Accident I noticed a presence about me, something there but not quite there. It did not feel menacing, on the contrary, it felt very home-type feeling, so I just kept a doing what I was doing. I had some vague notions of what the Holy Guardian Angel (HGA) was supposed to be, and decided to incorporate something along these lines into the ROG .

Upon arriving at the site, I realized that I forgot (I think purposefully) my sigils and guidelines for the rite. I performed the rite from memory and constructed the rest. Some very interesting things occur-ed. The first was, in arriving at the ritual, I felt sort of hurt/ angry because the drummers did not want to partake of any intoxicants with me. I did not know them very well and they did not trust me. I do not blame them as I probably would do the same, but this bothered me. This \"bother\" seemed to manifest more and more (after the rite) and it seems that similar factors have been brought to the fore. As if the rite induced and called for an analysis/ correction of my personality (in this arena). This is where I am at now, confronting different \"issues\". Another interesting thing occurred, during the rite, upon calling Set, I felt a presence, a very cynical presence. It felt like, \"Oh look, another god aspirant.\" A sigil manifested during the rite. A sigil whose attribution is the phoenix . I do not know what this sigil means yet: (SIGIL OMITTED call [1]) whose number is 76 , it sort of looks like a 7 & 6 combined. Upon being in an 'in-between' sleep/ awake state on Samhain night, a voice came to me. It sounded like a multitude of robot-like voices in unison. It said something to the effect of, \"You were given the first of three. You must plan. You must do this again.\" I find this all highly unusual (yeah, as if yelling at the moon is normal?). It also seemed as if before I heard the voice, when I closed my eyes, a picture, a formulation of some sort was 'mutating'. I also noticed I placed a strong emphasis on the Setian part of the rite, and the calling of the southern watchtower was very strong. Ketamine was used as an intoxicant during the rite, and some pot later that night in celebration at a local rave. No personal sigils were fired and again a somber self-reflective feeling saturates me.

Today is 11/4/98 I performed the ritual again last night under the full moon, this vision did not seem as powerful as the first vision, but I was granted another sigil. This one resembles the hand of ERIS: (SIGIL OMITTED call [2]) It is like the uniting of worlds, touching of heaven and hell. I went out later that night... Today is 11/5/98 Some observations of [1] whose number is 76 and is related to the phoenix. According to Grant. K. Nightside of Eden p.62 (abbreviated KG:NOE:p.#): \"The final head is named the 'messenger of the fatal wind' and it is identified with the breath of fire, with Serk, Scorpio, Sirocco, and Typhon, the Typhoon. In the Egyptian list this head is described as 'hissing to come forth and turn back; seeing by night and bringing by day', a perfect description of Bennu or Phoenix type of returner.\" KG:NOE:p70-71 \"She is the whore BABALON, the Scarlet woman of the Cult of the Beast. In Egyptian her name means the number seven (sefekh), she was the primordial goddess of the seven stars... 393 is the number of a highly secret Ophidian formula concealed in the name of an extra-terrestrial entity known as Aossic... the integers 393 (3+9+3=15=1+5=6), the number of the sun or solar phallic energy.\" So we see a unity between these concepts. A phoenix-type returner, a conflagration, BABLON and a celestial relation, with some correlation with Aossic (?) and empowered with solar phallic energy (Set as midnight sun?)."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"An interesting note (with some biblio-mancy) is that in the last page of chapter 7 of Nightside of Eden page 76 , Grant brings reference to, \"The Book of Dyzan\", and then this heralds chapter 8 (the number of submind and chaos). There also seems to be some relation to watery primordial teratomas which shall herald a return to chaos -- the Old Ones(?), water signs: Scorpio(?)\"my sun is in Scorpio\". The relation to BABALON also holds some connection with BINAH and we definitely have some crone type destructive energies here. The number of Babylon is 156 which is also the number of chaos. With Binah we have links to Set, which was integral with the rite of god-hood. 76=7+6=13 and we have a ton of links here, but check out the relations to Gargophias and the 13'th tunnel of Set, in the outer spaces. (This comes later) Side note on the second sigil: inverse Libra (?) ~ absolute chaos. • 7 is also a symbol of Set as an ax. • Sept is seven • The sixth and central cosmic power zone: beauty --Tiphareth --Sun/Son. • The number 6(sex):Vau -- Sexual Union • Zain: The number 7--twins Set/ Horus (Gemini), 6'th and 7'th months Gemini -- Cancer. Sexual Polarity. Lovers of the Tarot. The letter zain spelled in full equal's 67 (reverse 76) which symbolizes the womb of the mother (Binah=67). In reversal, the dark(?) Mother, inverse birth (destruction?) --The Phoenix again. There is also some relation to Sekmet.

The ineffable is; we must reach our own bliss. I was visited by a goddess tonight and it scared the living shit out of me. I finished firing three sigils into the heart of Oblivion on the dance floor. I was placing the third one by this \"Dark\" dancing woman's feet. She did not see me. She turned around and came up to me in about a minute and took my hand and said, \"Hello\". \"You know who I am, right.\" It was FUCKING BABALON!!! Now believe me when I say that I have never fucking seen a manifestation \"in the flesh\" of a deity. This weirded the shit out of me. She swept up my Desire into her being. She took me and a few others by the hand and danced with us, at the dance club. She wanted to play a little also. I felt un-worthy, but quickly shrugged this off and played the game. She smiled and danced with me and others. There was a form of telepathy (sort of). I think it was A., and he was telling me(sort of) about BABALON and the factions. BABALON was a servant, sort of like a mayor of a city in comparison to a governor of the state. Each of these factions (gods if you will) each had their own idea as to how the game should be played. She vanished after this and I knew she wanted me to partake of her bliss, instead of thinking on it. Now I speak of the VOID. This was terrifying. It was isolated, cold, bleak, black and empty (all in one breath). It was here that things dwelled which were not and would not be. These things were very much like the Chthonic Old Ones. They existed in another universe that touched our manifold at every point. Magick is the ultimate language. There were things in the VOID which were not magick.

The sigils were received after each ritual of the ROG. Each rite was performed as instructed by A. (this was written of previously, but I did not know it's name). The first two rituals were formalized, but the third was done (astral invocations) on my birthday night with dance astrally. Ketamine was used throughout. MDMA (BABALONS Sacrament) with Ketamine (Old Ones Sacrament) tonight. I offered prayers and Desire for communication and researched the Sigils and found some interesting links.

In CHAOS and BLISS, with FUCKING FUCK, - Elijah I will pursue this further Post-Notes: • There is no evil, but the things in the VOID came pretty close. • After singing hymns of calling to the deities, but preceding the actual invocations, I read a little bit from the Book of Revelation (x-tian canon Cp 17(?), the part about BABALON & the great MYSTERY) and a little bit from Principia Discordia (concerning ERIS and the origin of the universe). It seems now as I write this that my mind is trying to make me forget (my censor I think). • Another note on what was said by BABALON. \"I came because you called me, silly.\" I told her I was scared, and thought myself unworthy, but she knew and understood me. This was communicated through words and something more (?). I do not know if BABALON possessed some woman or this was a physical manifestation, but others saw her, and danced with her also."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 5 Summary of techniques “ A certain level of social conformity is present even among the Chaotes.

Presenting the core ideas of this operation we have the following (abstracted to a general form): • A certain degree of coincidences led me in the direction of the calling to a “ higher self” in the formulation of the R.O.G. • A shocking event happened, which was channeled wholly into feverish desire (prayer/ meditation) towards the desired goal. • This goal was taken to the point of obsession, while learning about the goals concepts, relations and connections of the HGA. • Certain alignments with resonant factors of myself were brought into play. • The operation was extended over a lengthy duration. • During the course of the operation a high degree of social isolation was present in day to day affairs. Now I was left reeling for months after the BABALON incident. I cannot emphasize the great deal of ‘truth’ which was felt at the time of these revelations. Now this is treading dangerous territory here, because obsession is sure to follow. Thus we get now into the subject of Liber CHRNZN See now appendix I and II.

Thou art not so.” - Some Dead Poet Being a chaotic interpretation of the Holy Guardian Angel Operation, as one summons the Angel of Light, the reverse impulse is attracted and mastery & integration of the darkness is necessary for unity. A thorough self- examination and analysis is a must, and identification with all our demonic aspects a key.

I shall not go into too much of the specifics of each for myself, but attempt to portray a general form which hopefully will be applicable. Each binding was summarized in a sigil form which represented successful completion of the subject. There were four lessor bindings and three greater bindings. The 4 Lesser Bindings are, The Binding of the Necessary/ Forced, The Binding of the Body, The Binding of the Heart, The Binding of the Mind.

This is actually very difficult, but the decisions and flux caused by the world of discs (money) is as trying to ones metal as you can get. When the time is right, this section is finished, of this the angel will instruct you. In order to assist in this area, I adopted a regular practice of money & wealth magick, following some of the techniques in Dave Lee’s Money Magick Work book, which I recommend. II The Binding of the Body - This includes a physical regime of exercise and eating “right”. I adopted a total overhaul of my physical system. Working out and Yoga (Asana [body], Pranayama [Breath], Mantra-yoga [speech/mind]) were utilized by me personally to a wonderful change of the physical. Of this binding I am the Living Sigil. III The Binding of the Heart - This was both recognition of the absolute falsity and truth of human love in respect to one another, self and divinity. This included the summary of Love under Will , relationships and other issues. IV The Binding of the Mind - The binding of the Mind was the Longest running initiation. This being a categorization of any, and every, personal demon that the magician has spawned over his life, a monumental if not impossible task. I categorized legions (ha) and sigilized and bound each one with name. This process is as a declaration to the sub-mind for regaining control over demonic factors."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The binding ceremony was the close of this phase after months of intensive labor and self analysis. This was very tedious as discovery of one little monster leads to an entire nest of related infections. To the end of this I used mathematical laws for binding chains of these programs numerically.

V The Binding of the Will - The binding of the mind included the complete demonic bindings and oaths of the infernal princes dictated under the traditional Abramelin operation. The Sigils of this section were given by the Princes of Hell themselves in recognition of divine right. VI The Binding unto BABALON - There was more than one facet to this binding. One of these facets took place at a party attended in Austin Texas (see journal exert *B1). The second aspect took place at a rave in Seattle WA (see journal exert *B2). In both circumstances the events transpiring were of a similar nature. My journal entries can give more insight into the nature of this initiation. Also see appendix III.

It represents the ascension of a Master to the Temple in one aspect, as well as ‘Unity’ of the Angel with it’s inverse in another aspect. The initiation took place across time.

They have “grown” through repression, neglect and other shadows and manipulate through secret and urges. In more extreme cases when the demon is very powerful it can possess an individual. This possession occurs in an enrapture of the demons sphere of influence. Like being filled with lust or as ritualistic possession where the monster is drawn up and takes over.

The shell is either destroyed upon death, subsumed or remains as a form of Quliphoth (in whatever part). Complete identification with the personality is the state referred to as “asleep” & “Hell”. Babalon is the queen of these shells (egos). She is the embodiment of the ego force, but because she is without ‘body’, she is not false, but being completely empty. She is literally burning in ecstasy. Her want is of continual intoxication of being, which is why she is a whore. She gives to all without restriction. A perfect slut and therefore most holy. She is to be as a succubus for the magus: partner, servant, familiar, tool, temptress. She can (when properly enticed) transmute the very substance of ego. Through her we come to understanding of the nature of consciousness and the fall of man. Her cup can be poison because if the ego has a shred of itself, this can think itself real and we actually transmute false to false ~ poison to poison.

Among the most profound are complex numbers (also called imaginary numbers) ( See also Liber CHRNZN plate II/11a) . The set of complex numbers in set theoretic notation is: C = {a + bi | a,b ∈ R & i= √ (-1)} This is the set of numbers a (which are wholly real) and the set of b multiplied by the imaginary root i. The graph of a complex value falls on a 2 dimensional coordinate system (in these cases; higher dimensional cases are extremely complex no pun intended, and require modification into a whole new set of numbers with modified mathematical laws). The horizontal axis is the real axis (consisting only of the a values) and the vertical axis is the imaginary axis. So the graph of the number (1 + i) looks like the following: A Collection of Sacred-Magick.Com < The Esoteric Library"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Now let us examine the concept of “i” under various degrees or powers. Let i= √ (-1) be our starting supposition. This is created to assuage our conscious mind that even though the square root of negative one does not make sense, we shall assume that there exists something (in this case i) which fills our need. This just coincidentally happens to model reality/space-time. i 2 = i*i = √ (-1) √ (-1) = -1 ~ We have a dual degree here which reflects into the negative real axis, that is, the imaginary i reflected to itself brings forth a negative multiplicative identity. i 3 = (i 2 )(i) = (-1) √ (-1) = -i ~ We have a tri-part power of the imaginary root resulting in a non-real answer which is the negative of our original supposition.

It must express it’s inner light in a reflection. This is the creation of the Master of the Temple. For the temple is of the Self and it is truly spoken that no life is in this hollow cast. For the Master has now been recreated unto creation. What lies beyond here must surely be folly. It now becomes our task to elaborate on our ways for the instruction of reflected self. She is of us and here now as always, for we are the Body. The Zos and the Kia, Our Outer-Inner structure of being ever so distilled from silence. Bearing a glimpse of the future way is like looking back upon ones birth. At the lowest strata we encounter the bestialities of Zos. Always attempting in blind knowledge, rising away from nothing. The attempts become fool hardy until the absolute absurdity called self is reached. Invocation of external illuminations can serve to clear up the intervening miasma as well."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Now what is this Scarlet Path (a view from above)? For Nothing is Absolute, the path of the Scarlet Brother is one of dis-enfranchisement. What meaneth this? Our brotherhood seeks recreation, thus it is that we are bound beyond time and space into the thrusting disarray of void. To establish a splotch of black amid the white. The inverse spaces bring calamity into their boring tunnels. The point of crossover is the star of Daath. We leap and propel our light (under the guidance of the angels) into ideo-spheres and vacuity. A transmutation, ex-nihilo. How this is accomplished is the domain of the given star and is approached quite naturally. The gift of Babalon is that we are of her, and the shells of victory become unraveled. This appears paradoxical at first, for she is ZOS complete. But the schizophrenic shards have a new facet about them, many as a matter of fact. When Babalon the great has fallen, her victory shall be complete. The Body itself shall become cognizant of it’s inner void/light instantaneously shredding existence asunder. Our way should not be approached directly, but askance. The mask called CHORONZON is infiltrated by the self, which is it’s only means of communicating with the light. The quaklephant seeks to merge with the shell and absorb it into his mass. Doing so traps the light in a cage of iron. Consumption on it’s death follows, where the quaklephant can gibber of it’s bounty.

It’s inner light is established as the inverse light of the crossover. It is quite insane, as a matter of fact, it is completely beyond any concept of sanity, even of the lower quliphoth. When encountering this gibbering soup, silence of both mind and thought is your weapon. The word of our silence sends the quaklephant scattered. You are reminded again that our addiction is Mind.
