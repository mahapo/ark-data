(A long hymn follows in alphabetical order, the alphabet being repeated several times, the hymn concludes with the verse:) “Lord of Hosts, happy is the man that trusts in You.” ( Psalms 84:13) 4. RABBI YISHMAEL SAID: “I have seen the King of Kings sitting on a high and exalted throne.

All Lords of the Presence ( Sare He’anim ) stand before Him as ordained ( K’Tikun ). (For the nose and the tongue) we do not have a measure, only names are revealed to us. The name of the nose: LGBTYYA , and also ABRGG , TTPYYH . His tongue (reaches) from one end of the World to the other, for it is said ( Psalm 147:19): “ He declares His Word unto Jacob, His statutes and His ordinances unto Israel .” He who knows not (how) to conclude this verse is in error for it is said: “He declares” its (the tongue) name ASSGYYHV , VAYYA .

Therefore, is He called: th e Great, the Mighty, the Awesome El ( la ), for it is said ( Torah Doverim 10:17): “ For the Lord hvhy your Elohim , HE ( avh ) is Elohim of Elohim , Lord of Lords, the great El ( la ), the Mighty and the Awesome .” 6. HE SAID TO ME: “The si ze of the parasangs, what they measure: each parasang consists of three mils, each mil contains ten thousand cubits, each cubit two spans ( Zereth ), and His span fills the whole Olam ( ,li , world, or universe). As it is written ( Isaiah 40:12): “ Who has measured in the hollow of His hand the waters, and meted out the heavens with His span.” 8 7. RABBI NATHAN, THE PUPIL OF R. YISHMAEL SAID: He also gave me the measure of the nose right and left, as well as that of the lips and cheeks. Also he gave me the measure of the forehead, he also set down rules for every cubit. The width of the forehead is equal to the height of the neck, and so is the shoulder. The length of the nose (is) like the length of the small finger. The height of the cheek is equal to half the roundness of the head. These measures are also found in human beings. (In size of) His lips: seventy-seven parasangs. His upper lip is called GBRH , TYA , and the lower one HZRGYA . His mouth is fire consuming fire. When He speaks its name (is) ASDRA . -(the next five words are not translat able) The crown on His head (is) five hundred thousand by found hundred thousand (parasangs); its name is VYS . The precious stone between its horns [ray s?] is called YS AMV ALY YS AMI ALY is engraved upon it. My friend is white and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand. His head is bright as the finest gold, His locks are like waving foliage and black as a raven. His eyes are doves by streamlets of water. His cheeks are like a bed of roses... Two thousand ten thousands parasangs. And whoever does not conclude with this verse ( Shir HaShirim 5:10-16) is in error: “His cheeks are like a bed of roses, As banks of sweet herbs; His lips are as lilies, Dropping with flowing myrrh. His hands are as rods of gold, set with beryl."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 His body is as polished ivory, overlaid with sapphires. His legs are as pillars of marble, Set upon sockets of fine gold. His aspect is like Lebanon, Excellent as the cedars. His mouth is most sweet. Yea, He is altogether lovely.

The right (eye) is named HDR , VVLD; the left (eye is named) APDH (in Lemberg APRH ), TzTzYHV . The height of His ears (is) like the height of His forehead. The right (ear) is called ATzTHYYA ; the left (ear is called) MNVGHV . Hence, the total measure [of the Divine Stat ure] is ten thousand of ten thousands ten thousand thousand parasangs in height, and one thousand thousand ten thousands of parasangs in width. 9 8. RABBI YISHMAEL TOLD THIS (THING) TO RABBI AQIBA. HE SAID TO ME: “He who knows this measure of our Creator, a nd the praise of the Holy One, blessed be He, Who is hidden from the creatures, is assure d that he is the son of the world to come. (He will inherit the world to come), and w ill have in this world the good of the other world, and will live long in this world. 9. RABBI YISHMAEL SAID TO ME (the a bovementioned Rabbi Nathan?) in the presence of his pupils. I and Rabbi Aqiba vouch for this, that whoever knows this measure of our Creator, and the praise of the Ho ly One, blessed be He, he will surely be a son of the world to come, provided he learns it regularly every day: His body fills the Throne of Fire of the Torah . His name: BG , BG , GB , HVMG . His locks (of) His body are named: DBR , BRYR , DVBG . They have half of a nickname called: GL , SRB . One of His eyes with which He sees from one end of the world to the other is named: AKSST , the sparks issuing from it give light to all creatures; the other one, which sees backwards (with which He sees in advance), what is going to happen in the future, is named ATNVGST . His body is like unto a bow, the bow is like unto its name: LQSSYS , half of it is named MN , KMTz . His sword is called MTzMTzYT , MTzYA . His Throne of Glory is named LVRKZ , PYRVTA . The place of His seat is called DVRPZ , PRVRPZ this is also His nickname. The feet of His glory are the Chayot . The Chayot standing under Him. The first foot of the Throne, which is a Chayah , is called AGLYV , HTzBYYH ."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 The second foot of the Throne, which is a Chayah , is called BBBK , PLBYYPTY . The third foot of the Throne, which is a Chayah , by name KBBB , ALGYY . The fourth foot, which is a Chayah , is called ATzBYYA , BZBZ . The likeness of their faces... the nature of a lion, the stamp of an eagle, the image of an ox, and the blank face of a man. Each has four faces, four f aces, and four faces on each corner (of a face), sixty-four faces for each Chayah . Each Chayah has four faces and (four) wings, each wing consists of four wings; four wings to a face, four wings to a wing...sixty four wings to each Chayah . The Lord of the human face is ALYH, AMTzB, AMTz, AMT, KMTz. The names of the Lord of the lion-face (are) HVDV, DYH, HYDVAH, AL, AVRYA, HVD, HVYH, TMGMTz. The Lord of the ox-face is called [SVR in both texts] HLYH , TzMTzMMKA, MSKYA. And the name of the Lo rd of the eagle-face (is) ‘APPY, ALYH, MMTzYT, TzHVRYRYAL. When Israel sinned, the ox-face was hidden away, and was replaced with a Kerub . The name of the Lord of the Kerub -face (is): TMTMNY, ALYH, KRRVBYH, KRBH, PSPSYH, PTzPTzYH, HNQNQYA. They (the Chayot ) are the ones who say “ Holy Holy Holy... ” ( Isaiah 6:3), it is they who say, “ Blessed be the glory... ” ( Ekekiel 3:12) as it is written ( Psalm 146:19): “ He declares His Word unto Ya’aqov .” And he who does not conclude with Torah B’reshith , with the order of the Creation, errs in the glory of the Holy One, blessed be He. His glory fills everything, hosts of thunder rage on His right. Bands of people rage on His left, and colors ( Simanim ) rage in front of Him. Within the colors, splendor, and darkness, cloud, thick cloud (‘ Arafel ) and mire of clay ( Tithyaven ). In front of Him (is) a field of sown seed ( Zeroo’yin ). Between one star and another (is) the source of lightning. Between one lightning and another (is) the door of Hashmal. And above: winds, roaring, thunder and lightning, and the holy palms, 10 and ropes of seals, used for ascending and descending. On the Holy One, blessed be He, (are) Grace ( Chen ), Love ( Chesed ), Glory ( Kavod ), Mercy ( Rachamim ), Splendor ( Hod ), Crown (‘ Atehreth ), Adornment ( Hadar ), Beauty ( Tifareth ), and Majesty ( Ge’ooth ). The Hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, (is named) Metatron. They say: Mighty and Strong... They say: Holy and Blessed... And they appear before Him with a great sound (as in Ezekiel 1:24): “ As they went, a noise like the sound of a host .” They stand before Him. The Youth ( Na’ar ) Metatron appears and prostrates himself before the Holy One, blessed be He, His name AHH ... He praises and glorifies and says: “Blessed be the glory of the Lord hvhy from His place.” hvhy , vh , vh , vhvy , hyyhy"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 “Blessed be the glory of the Lord hvhy from His place.” And they repeat after him: “Ble ssed be the glory of the Lord hvhy from His place,” and “Blessed be the Name of the glory for ever.” He (Metatron) enters in front under the Throne of Glory. He is accompanied by stones of fire and hailstones and a wall of roaring ( Z’aaf ) on his right. On his left, wings of storm and strength of tempest accompany him. When Metatron enters before the Holy One, blessed be He, under the Throne of Glory, he holds (the Throne) with a mu ltitude of wings, and all the ministering angels come before the Holy One, blesse d be He, and say: “the great, the mighty, and awesome El ( la ).” They praise the Holy One, blessed be He, thrice daily through Metatron. The Holy One, blessed be He, bestow ed His splendor and His beauty on the ministering Angel Metatron, the Lord of the Presence, who has been appointed grand master over all the Lords and ministering angels. They stand before him, and he stands higher and higher upwards, and ministers before Adam; a fire consuming fire Kise ( ack , throne) is its name. This is the seat of Metatron, the Lord of the Presence, which is written with One- Letter (Alef a , the Unity) with which Heaven a nd Earth have been created, and sealed with the ring “ Ahyeh Asher Ahyeh ” ( hyha rsa hyha ). And is written with seven letters, and seven letters, a nd twenty-four letters, and seventy-two names, and seven Kedushoth (Holinesses). And it is pl aced on six of their names, and is engraved on twelve stones, and is written on seven sounds (voices) on a height of six by six (see Sifra Detzniyutha ... Zohar II : 186b). It was given to our teacher Mosheh (Rabbenu) in innermost chambers, in hidden hiddenness, in wonder of wonders. The Holy One, blessed be He, permitted ne ither Adam nor Shem, the son of Noah, nor Abraham, Yitza’aq, or Ya’aqov to use it. Only to Mosheh did He give permission to use it, as it is written ( Torah Doverim 23:20): “ Behold I send an angel before you ,” and the Holy One, blessed be He, warned Mosheh to beware of Him, as it says ( Torah Shmoth 23:21): “ Beware of Him, and obey His voice, disobey Him not, for He will not pardon your transgressions because My Name is in Him .” And Mosheh said to the Holy One, blessed be He ( Torah Shmoth 33:15): “ If Your NOT ( al ) -Presence go with me; carry us (into the) NOT ( al ) , up from here .” 11 The angels that are with him (Metatron) come and surround the Throne of Glory, they on one side, Chayot on the other, and the Shekhinah upon the Shekhinah of Glory is in the middle. A Chayah ascends on the Serafim and descends on the dwelling place of Metatron, and announces in a loud voice, in the sound of a soft whisper [still small voice]: “This is the Throne of Glory.” Immediately the Ofanim become silent, the angels become quiet, the Irin Kadishin make haste and rush into the River of Fire ( Nehr Dinur ), and the Chayot turn their faces down to the ground.

End of SH’IR QOMA"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 SH’IR QOMA RECONSTRUCTION OF THE TEXT ACCORDING TO BEST EVIDENCE The Sh’ir Qoma text is known to be corrupt, as a ll current texts come from a single corrupt text published in the 1701 Amsterdam edition (Eleazar of Worms). Consequently, the dimensions taken as directly translated will not lead to a reasonable image of the Yosher (upright form of the Lord hvhy ). However, if the following changes are made, the Yosher image that is yielded (see Fig. 2.3, p.67) can be shown to be self-consistent with the text. Seventeen dimensions were left unchanged, eleven dimensions were changed as follows, and the last two dimensions, dealing with the total measure, were not used. SECTION DIMENSION READ (x10 7 Parasangs) CHANGE MADE HEIGHT (Seat of Glory) 118 add alafim HEIGHT (Seat of Glory) 118 add alafim , Seat of Glory is located in single Eye of Vast Face in center of Small Face’s head.

However, it is likely that alafim is not correct, superfluous, because the total would be much greater than the component parts: twice 118 ten thousands. 2 The eye measures are missing in the Lemberg edition (1865). 3 In Lemberg, the measure of the Skull is given as 30 rebaboth i.e. 30 ten thousand parasangs. 4 In the text the reading is: the ten thousands of thousa nds of Israel. That is much more than the numbers of the Israelites at the time of the Exodus, to which expre ssions like this in Midrashic literature refer. It is therefore translated as “tribes,” the tribes in Israel were divided into groups of thousands (see Judges 6:15, I Samuel 10:19, Micah 5:1). The author here used a phrase from Torah Vayiqra 10:36. 5 “Who knows this mystery?” It is said that HaShem is a Great Unity who has One ultimate secret--the absolute Truth of the Ayn . 6 Various names are inserted at this point, perhaps the name of the person using the prayer. 7 The name of what? Usually names are given for both sides. 8 The height of the Lord hvhy of 2.36 X 10 6 parasangs is 1.4 X 10 11 Olam . If we take the current astrophysical dimensions of the Olam (Universe) as 10 23 miles or 1.6 X 10 28 cm. (2 x 10 10 light years), this leads to the dimensions of 1.4 X 10 34 miles or 2.2 x 10 39 centimeters for the Lord hvhy ’s height. 9 The number of 10 15 parasangs for the total measure is c onsiderably greater than the 2.36 x 10 6 parasangs given previously for the height of the Lord hvhy in Section 1. 10 “The holy palms.” The text has KALFE HAQEShETH . The translation is based on the correction made by Wortheim in Bote Midrashoth 1, p.43, Note 179. He suggests the reading KPE HAQODESh . 11 This is the only reference in the Sh’ir Qoma to the way beyond Small Face, to His Ayn Panekha (“His Face of Nothing”), NOT ( al ) form, behind the Throne."}]
