Am ong the Aryans and Greeks, the Assyrians a nd Egypti ans, we find indications of a developm ent which gave to num bers their real s ignificance and em ployed them in a system of sym bolism which had respect to something m ore than mere enu meration. While it is true that a figure is a symbol denoti ng a quantity, it is also a fact th at a quantity thus sym bolised may denote m uch more than a mere num ber, as we may learn from chemical anal ysis, where two bodies consisting of an equal num ber of atom s of the same elements are of an entirely different chem ical nature. This is the case as be tween phenylisocyanide and benzonitril e. But here we have a difference in the arrangem ent of t he atom s, the single atom of nitrogen being active in t he one and pa ssive in the other m olecule. The positi on serves, however, for a general thesis which regards all bodies as com pounded of elements drawn 1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"from a single base, their specific differences being due to the dom ination of one over an other element in them. The astrologers affirm that indivi dual character answers to a sim ilar an alysis, for where as all m en are constituted from the same cosmic forces, one has more of Saturn in him than others, bei ng born under the dom inance of that planet, while another has m ore of the nature of Mars, on account of its ascendancy or elevation at his birth, corresponding differences of ch aracter being observable in them, the one being pond erous, melancholic and tacturn, the other energetic, enterprisi ng and dem onstrative. Man, in fine, is a m odification of cosm ic elements, a co mposite of co smi c forces , like any other body. But also something m ore. Behind the coloured glass there is alway s the light. The intelligence striking through the com posite of pe rsonal organisa tion reveals itself as ch aract er. Sim ilarly, behind t he cosm os there is an Intelligence which m anifests to us through cosm ic elements as Nature. God geometrises, a nd in Nature we h ave th e geometrical expression of the Divine Intelligence . Crystallisation takes place accordi ng to definite laws. All the superior m etals crystallise at the an gle or complemental angle of a re gul ar polygon, which may be inscribed in a circle; and th eses angles are those which are indicat ed by the astral sc ience as operative. Water, which the ancients referred to in a mystical sense as the mother of all things, their m aterial base, crystallises at an angle of 60 degrees. The universe is but the 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"crystallised ideation of God; it is a divine thought- form . It is by t he study of num bers, therefore, that we may learn the laws of divine expr ession, from the constitution of t he uni verse down to the most t rivial occurrence in i ts evolutional progress. What we call an event is but a displacement and rearrangement of the parts of our sphere of reality. Changes ta king place in the cosmo s ar e acco mpani ed by changes in all its constituents, and these changes may converge to a cataclysm . They m ay also produce a shower of rain, an epidem ic, or a rise of a penny per cental in the price of wheat. Adm itting man’s relations t o the cosm os, and it would be difficult t o deny them , there is really no en d to the concatenati on of effects which may arise from any single cosmic disposition, as for instance, Sun oppose Mars, wh en our earth lies in the diam eter of the Martian sphere of influence. In the study of num bers, therefore, we are not concerned with figureology, or mere sy mbolism , but with quantities and geometrical relations. This study has its principles, its alphabet, its language and term inology, and its signi fication. In the course of these pages I shall endeavour to show t hat there is a signi fication attaching to num bers which for lack of a be tte r te rm I m ust c all occult; for although it would be a com paratively easy matter to trace a relationshi p existing between man and the universe, it would be by an arguem ent of a m ystical nature onl y that any conn ection between num bers and events could be t raced.

In this doctr ine, Matter is the ultimate expression of Spirit, as Form is that of Force. Ther efore, for every spirit ual Force there is a correspondi ng m aterial Form . The whole of Nature thus becom es an expression of t he underlying spi ritual worl d, and it s physi ognom y is to us the chiefest source of inspiration. The laws governi ng this expression are traceable only i n term s of num bers, i.e. of geometrical ratios. The m oral sense is only a subconscious recognit ion of the integrit y and harm ony of natura l laws, a reflex of the greater environm ent.

They do not expre ss anything of quality. Thus, if we say 2 eggs and 2 eggs m ake 4 eggs, we leave out of consideration the fact that one or m ore of them may be bad. From this we learn that 2, or any other num ber, is potentially good or evil, its quantity being unaffected. Every num ber has a certain power which is not expressed by the figure or sym bol em ployed to denote quantity only.

The unit idea of Being is expr essed in the form of a circle, which is zero, of indefi nite dim ension, being either the infinite totality or the smallest particle. When we posit Being we include all wi thin the circumf eren ce of our thought and perception. When we posit a being, we place the point within the circle. We know that that, or any other of it s kind, is the centre of its own circle. Thus every unit of life has its ow n universe, its sphere of influence, and its relations with the things of its sphere of existence. It is a microcosm, a centre of cosmic energy, a reflection in time and space of the One. If we trace the action or directi on of this unit of life we follow a definite line of thought, or sequence of events, invol ved i n its progress. Th e poi nt ha s been put i n motion, has been given direction; the poi nt generates the line. 17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"What we at first conceive to be a straight line of definite direction we soon perceive to be a curve, the directing force being outsi de of the life-sphere of that unit. We discern that it has an orbi t, and is respondi ng to a gravitational pull. So that wh at was generated within the circle answers to the cir cle. Further, w e see that none of these units pursues a perfect or circular orbit, but that its co urse is marked by a certain eccentricity which entails that at certain stages of its career it wanders further fr om its gravitational centre than at ot hers, and then we observe that its progress is slower. Also, we observe that none of them keeps to a uniform plane, but shows a certain inclination or l ist of i ts own – sometim es being above and again below the norm al plane. M oreover, it is seen to have an obliquity or deviation from the upright, and an oscill ation on it s own lin e o f ob liq uity. It is, in fact, an average human being or a planet, as you please. It is a little world in itself, a microcosm. Now get back to the point, whi ch is m erely positi on. The point is put in dire ct m otion and the l ine is generated. This line, when put in direct m otion, generates the superficies; and this, again, the solid. Given a line in motion, we m ay derive t he circle or t he square, the sym bol of the spirit or that of Matter. From the m otion of the circle we may d erive th e cylinder or pillar, and the sphere. But if one l imb or se micircle remains fixed, its complement will by its m otion describe an ellipse, 18"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"and at two point s lyi ng in the same plane the centre of the circle will coincide with the foci. Beyond these three motions we cannot proceed. It i s sim ilar i n the case of the square, an d its resultant cube, cylinder, and cone. Therefore our thought, which is three dimensional, is capable of generating from the evoluti ons of a point these figures – the sphere, the c one, and the cube; and their superficial equivalents – t he circle, the triangle, and the square; with their perverts – the oblong and the ellipse. These figures have always been used in symb olical thought to represent states of c onsciousness. But we are only concerned with them as re lated to the num bers 1, 3, 4, which denote God, Hum anity, and Nature – Osiris, Horus, Isis. For we answer to the universal paradigm of the One Being, compounded of spirit, soul, and body. Therefore we consent in our ve ry being t o this necessary geometrical relation of thought , and since all geometrical relations are expressions of num erical ratios, we give natural assent to the power of num bers on which, in the Pythagorean concept , the universe is founded. That t his is truth the great Kepler ha s demonstrated, an d also Newton. When, therefore, we ascribe certain qualities or properties to a number, it is on account of a particular connotation or association of ideas im pressed upon us by reference to universal standa rds, princi ples, and laws. Thus, the circle, with its centre, represents to us t he sun; and by correspondence of the na tural with the spiritual, it also conveys the idea of the Deity. For, as all 19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"bodies within the system are illum ined and warmed by the rays of the sun, which is their gravitational centre, so all souls are enlightened and quickened by the wisdom and love of God, who is thei r universal attractor. And as there is but one Sun who is suprem e in the system , so there is but one God who is the universal Lord. It answers to the nu mber 1. So the triangle represents to us and connotes the idea of hum anity, in its threefold aspect of spirit, soul, and body, its three-dimensional world of relativity and t hought , and its threefold concept of tim e. It answers to the nu mber 3. The cross represents matter, but the cross i s onl y t he cube unfol ded. Its num ber is 4. What we have said of certain num bers we hold to be true only by reason of the correspondence existing between the higher and lower worlds, the sphere of causes and that of effects, the noum enal and phenomenal worlds. Not that num bers have any qualities or virtues of their own, but that they acquire such by reason of their quantative relations to the causative world, which is the world of thought. A num ber is a seal or im press of natural law as surely as is the shape of a flower, the sound of an atm ospheric vi bration, t he colour of an etheric wave. The o rbit of a planet has relation to its mass, bulk, and velocity; and si milarly the significance of a nu mber answers to defin ite archetypal or noumenal relations. By all of which we mean no m ore than this: that 20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"there is a system of interpretation in num erology which is supported by experience, but has its origin beyond the real m of the phenomenal wo rld. If no such system existed, it would be im possible to prove the geom etrical relations of thought. But this is done daily by those who make use of num bers for purposes of divination. Divination m ay be regarded as both a science and an art . It assumes the properties of a science when t here is conscious process of discri mination, calculation, and interpretation i nvol ved. It may be called an art when it i s conducted by subconscious a nd autom atic means. This distincti on is necessarily only a crude one, and open to many obj ections. I think I am right in saying that the activity of what we call the subconscious m ind, in contra- distinction to the atten tive m ind, and the related functioning of the autom atic faculty, ar e facts admitt ed by science.

The whole universe i s linked up by such correspondence as is affirmed by astrologers to exist between the macrocosm and man. I cannot tell you w hy t he sign Aries is related to the encephalon. I can only assert it as a fact in nature brought home to me by repeated experience of the effects of planets in that sign. We know that there is a force in nature which we call the attraction of gravi tation. Science recognises the f act while yet unable to demonstrate the at traction. What has been hitherto regarded as a “pull” will later be more successfully dem onstrated as a “push”. Professor Hinton ha s said: “We know a great deal about the How of things; it is the Why we do not understand”. I totally disa gree with him . We are deplorably ignorant of the first principl es of existence. Our science is a mere record of observed phenom ena and experim entation. It m ust always be so while we are ignorant of the nature of Life itself. On the other hand, we leav e our science behind, and make appeal to phi losophical and reli gious pri nciples when answering to the Why of existence.

It is merely a matter of interpretation if w e rega rd the universe as a symbol ; and what else it, or any part of it, may be I ha ve not yet discovered. All sym bols, i.e. ideographs , are geo metr ical expressions of thought . So figures are expressions of num bers, as num bers are of quantitive relations. When the astronomer affirm s that the planets m ove in elliptical orbits, he is em ploying a sy mbol and expressing a quan titive relationshi p. He is not expr essing a fact, for he knows that no body could describe an ellipse about a moving focus and not be left behind in space. Yet he affirms the elliptical orbit and the prope r m otion of the sun through space at o ne and the same. Wh en affir ming the elliptical orbit, he fi nds it convenient to posit a sym bolical or fixed focus in the sun and a kenofocus in space. The dem onstration is elaborate. It answers to observed phenomen a. But so did the ep icycle o f Ptolem y. The ancient Chinese formul ated a theory of eclipses which was found to be workable a nd in line with events, but they had no conception of the earth as a spheroid. So, whether it be epicycle, ellipse, or cycloidal curve, it is pure sym bolism ; an expression of quantit ive relationship, not necessarily of fact. Sim ilarly, when the chem ist uses the sym bol H 2 O for water, he expresses a quan titive relationship which does not i nform us in any way concerning the process by which nature derives the flui d from the two gaseous volum es.

Whatever science we m ay st udy we shall fi nd that it has its own term inology, its symbolism , and its empirical methods.

The Hebrew alphabet has special reference to the Tarot – which is obvi ousl y of Sem itic origin, although it has received a m ore cat holic inte rpretation. The method of applying the Tarot to the resolution of a pe rson’s signature is as follows:- The values of the letters are set down against a person’s nam e and m ultiplied successively by the num ber answering to the co nverse position of the letter in the nam e. The Christian and surnames being thus dealt with, the totals of each name ar e extended and added together, to which also the place of the Sun at his birth is added.

Another method of using t he Tarot Keys consists in adding together the year and the age a p erson attains in that year, making a sum whic h answers, when reduced, to one of the Tarot Keys. Thus Napoleon was born in 1769. He became First Consul for life i n 1801, aged 32. 1801 + 32 = 1833 = 15, an evil porte nt. Typhon seat ed upon t he iron cube in the Inferno.

The Blind Fool = selfishness, vanity, inconsequence, blindness, det achment, conspicuous foll y, etc. Defeated at Waterloo, 1815, aged 46. 1815 + 46 = 1861 = 16.

The square of 3 is 9, and if we arrange the digits 1 t o 9 in such form that they make a magic square, i.e. so that it counts to t he same total in any direction, we shall have this figure:-  4 9 2  3 5 7  8 1 6 41"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Here it will be seen that the sum of any t hree figures, in any direction, = 15, which num ber has already been mentioned as one of the sacred num bers, as it embodies the name of the Deity.

If we can trace this covert agreemen t between the sym bolism of na ture and events of human life, or expressions of individual character, we m ay surely affirm that it exists apart from natural causation, for t here is no c ausative relationshi p between the occurrence of a num ber in a ma n’s nam e or the dat e of his bi rth, and any event or characteristic we may associate with such a nu mber.

Aries they found to correspond to th e head, Taurus to the neck, Gem ini to the arm s, and so down to t he feet, which corresponded to Pisces. “As above, so below”; the great is reflected in the small. Th e circle of the zodiac has its mundane relations. An em piri cism continued through many cent uries determin ed th e signs corresponding to various areas of the earth, to territories, kingdom s, cities, and towns. The method em ployed was that of the scientific experimen talist. Here is a toxi n, let us see wh at effect it will have when injected. The experimen t yields certain results, and research is made f or an antidote, something that will neutralise the act ion of the poison. Or, a bacteriologist makes a culture of germ s and studies their effects upon animal bodies. He also experim ents on the culture itself to ascertain what medium favours the development of the germ s, an d what tends to sterilise the medium and render it fatal to the dev elopment of the germ s. Then, by empirical m eans, he has two great facts 76"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"before him : (a) that certain germ cultures produce certain morbid conditions in ani mal b odies, and (b) that certain media n eutralise the action of these ger ms. The astrologers followed the same method. They observed the effects follo wing immediately upon the ingress of the various planets into the signs of the zodiac, and what happened during the st ay of the planet in each sign. They determ ined the specific natures of the planets and their m odifications by a careful and patient em piricism. Then the de ductive method was m ore extensively em ployed, and, fro m like cau ses, like effects were anticipated. A retrospec tive calcul ation gave them the means of ascertaining the past effects of planetary positi ons, while a prospective cal culation enabled the m to predict what mi ght reas onably be expected fro m identical causes in the future. When two clouds are electrifie d, one becomes negative to the other, they rush togeth er, and their i mpact produces thunder; while the discharg e of electricity produces light ning, as if the term inal s of a battery were brought together. The lightning flash i s only a big spark. Now, the astrologers had alr eady discovered that Mars was a positive planet and a he at producer, while Saturn was a neg ative planet and a cold producer. They wer e naturally curious to observe what effects would transpire when these planets were in c onjunction, i.e. in the sam e part of the heavens as s een from the Eart h’s centre.

By a com bination of the known orbital m otions of t he two bodies, they were able to construct a table of t he past conjunctions of these planets through the entire circle of the zodiac. Astronom y, chronol ogy, and history conspired to the result, and th e effects of the conjunctions of Mars and Saturn in the su ccessive signs of the zodiac were predicable in a g eneral manner for all time. Needless to say they were of an adverse, an d most frequently of a violent, nature. There is a conjunction of these planets every alternate year, the conjunction falling in the next sign on each occasion; so that in 265 years it performs nine revoluti ons, and comes nearly to t he same place in the zodiac. If we trace the conjunction t hrough recent years, we find a singular uniform ity of ill effects attending upon the countries ruled by t he sign of conjunction.

If by planetary periods we may trace the periodicity of events, why not by num erical sequences? What we have to remem ber is that there is no such thing as chance in a universe controlled by l aw. We have to reduce all our observations to a statement which, if not conform able to any known law, is at least not in conflict with such laws as we know. A law should include all the facts.

Divination, which depends so l argely upon thi s faculty, is universall y associated with the sym bolism of numbers. One such system may here be cited.

The figures in this line are then successively added together, the first with the second, the second with the third, the third with the fourth, and so on until they have been paired and added, the one to the other. The sum, abated by 9 whenever it exceeds that am ount, is set down beneath, so as to form a second line of fi gures. These ar e then treated in th e same manner, by successive pairing and addition, and a third line 95"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"is produced.

A person asks : “Shall I gain my desire”? There are 5 words in this sentence, so the figure 5 is set down. “Shall” contains 5 letters, “I” 1, “gain” 4, “m y” 2, “desire” 6.

A variant of this kabala is as follows:- The resultant digit being an even num ber, the triangle is searched along the right side and the top line for three other even num bers, which are extracted in order as they occur, But if the resultant be odd, then the left side and tops are searched for three other odd num bers.

They gain their significance by the associations we attach to them in our thought, and in this sense only are they symbolical , i.e. by association or by em ployment. If, therefore, Nature em ploys a numerical sym bolism, we may conform ably em ploy certain num bers as sym bols, and indeed all num bers, by reference to their com ponents or their unit values. The method em ployed is therefore of im portance, for it would be unreasonable to use one m ethod for deriving our sym bol, and another for i ts interpre tation. Decide, therefore, what method of divination you intend to em ploy, and use that m ethod both in enum eration and interpretation of your question. Nature uses a sy mbolism whic h is wholly unintelligible to the great majorit y of peopl e, and this fact appears to sustain the argument that num bers have a signifi cance apart from our recognition of it . This, at first sight, m ay appear contradictory to what I have just said regarding the significance of numbers; but I spoke of them as sym bols, and t hey appear as sym bols onl y when we have learned their true significan ce and begin to em ploy them as expressions of quantitive relations.

When I sai d that Nat ure uses a sym bolism, and that it has consciousness of us as individuals, I regarded it mediately as the expression of Divine Intelligence. It is in reality the Deity, who is conscious in and through Nature, as man is conscious in and through his body. The celestial m otions are part of the sym bolism we are considering; each of the plan ets is a symbol of som e special focal centre of deif ic force. The Moons are symbols, and so are comets. The Sun has been used by us as a sym bol of the deific Powe r for ages. It is proba bly so used throughout the hum anities of all its satellites. It is the first and greatest reve lation of God to man. By Saturn and Jupite r and all of the bodies of t he system exist and perform their func tions, and sym bolise the different a spects and quanti ties of the One, altogether apart from the con sciousness and understanding of t he average clodpole. Ther efore, we say Nature is a sym bol, and that it attains signification for us only whe n we understand it. Its l anguage being understood, we m ay em ploy it, interpreting its dark passages by aid of the few sentences of which we are sure. If cosm os had no l aws, if the planets m oved in m ixed orbits as they listed and at varying velocities irrespective of their mutual dista nces, their num bers would cease to have any basis or si gnificance and 2 x 2 = 9 would be as true as that 2 + 2 = 4.

And it is said, too, that there cannot be m ore than ten ciphers, because unity, 1, and zero, 0, begin and end th e expression of the Deity; and when co mbined they are phi , the source of all t hings and t he end of all , the alpha and omega, united as the sym bol of the palingenesis.

Thought is of two orders, conscious thought elaborated by the functions of the attentive m ind, and unconscious , or what is now called subconsci ous, thought. This latter function of the mind is abundantly illustrated by the phenomena of sponta neous telepathy. At any m oment a person’s m ind is negati ve to some others and positive to the rest. Ev ery brain, while functioning, creates definite vibrations or waves in t he etheric ambient. These waves im pinge upon the brai ns of others, and, if in syntonic relations with them, will cause an apperception of personality, so that the individuals affected will immediat ely create a mental image of the person whose thought is projected, and whos e presence i s shortly made apparent to the senses. Ther e is then the proverbial “talk of angels”. Yet it will be f ound upon inquiry not only that the transmitter is unconscious of any 102"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"efforts towards self-projectio n, but wholly obli vious of the vicinity of the percipient . The conclusion based upon a close study of this fa miliar but little understood phenom ena, is that t he subcon scious, or sublim inal, m ind of the proj ector is not only aw are of the presence of other minds, but is capable of proje cting itself into immediate relations with them. This projection is received by the percipient as a subconscious impression which presently wells up in the region of the attentive m ind in such way as to create a subject of thought. Extremely sensitive persons not onl y have an appe rception of a presence, but also a vision. By the same or sim ilar functioning of the subconsci ous m ind, we are made aware that certain people are inimical to our interests. We sm other the im pression in deference to our good taste, or “the proprieties”, ad mit them t o our confidence, and everlastingly regret the fact that we did not act upon our “firs t 103"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"im pressions”. There is, as I have said in a former chapter , a part of us which is in touch with the world-soul, and capable of sharing in the universal experiences o f that universal principle. The world-soul is again in its turn li nked to the uni versal soul. The world-soul is the planetary or earth consciousness; the universal consciousness is centred in the solar sphere, which is th e coordinating centre of the system , sp iritually, psychically , and physically. That is why the seers and prophets call the Lord of t he Universe the “Day Star” and the “Sun of Righteousness”. But to get back to our positio n. The geo metrical relations of thought are such that every idea is capabl e of num erical expression, and this fact appears to have been known t o the Orientals, for it was from one of t hem that I had first illustration of it. It was the occasion of a meeting of friends interested in spiri tual and psychic matters. I was invited by a Sw am i to take in hand or think of any object I m ight select. I immediately com plied, taking special precautions t hat sight of the object was not obtai ned by hi m. In his absence from m y room I took a postage-stam p, of value one anna, and placed it in a rather large box, holding this latter in my hand. I then recalled the Swam i and bent m y thought upon the stam p within the box . The Swam i asked me to give him a num ber, the first that came into m y m ind, and I gave hi m one. He then immediately described the subject of m y thought. It was of “square” form, but longer tha n 104"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"it was broad; very thin, it had two colours on one side only, it s edges were like a saw, and the value of i t was one anna. Needless to say, I was m uch im pressed by t he experiment, but said at once that the num ber asked for was only a blind, and that it was a feat of direct thought- reading without contact. The event proved that I was quite wrong, for he presen tly described things spoken about in letters as yet u nopened, and further made prediction of certain events which afterwards transpired. On each occasion he required that I should give him a num ber. Finally, he convin ced me m ost forcibly by revealing the process to m e so that I was m yself able to repeat the experimen ts quite successfully, and have since used the method on m any occasions for describing people’s thoughts, answering questi ons, predicting events, and finding l ost thi ngs. It is a feat for whic h one may claim no m erit, being wholly dependant on the working of t he subconscious m ind i n the consultant him self. The argument is that t he sublim inal m ind knows that concerning whi ch the supraliminal mind exercises itself, but it lacks the means, while the attentive m ind is functioning, of im pressing i tself. In the use of num bers, however, it finds an automa tic means of expression. It is m y intention to give the reader a partial knowledge of the process, sufficient, in fact, to en able him to m ake experiment of the num erical relations of thought. I rem ember that one of the ear liest opportunities I had of testing m y proficiency in this method was when, on a 105"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"certain evening, I w as suddenl y surprise d to see my vis- a-vis at t he dinner-ta ble put he r hand to her throat w ith an expression of alarm. I gave her instant att ention, and was relieved in some measure wh en she exclai med: “I have lost m y coral necklace, with all m y keepsake pendants on it”! I immediately u ndertook to trace the lost article, and having got a num ber from her, I announced that the article wo uld be found near an iron railing or partition, and close to where a horse was standing. So much I learned from the num ber given to m e. What followed was merely diplom atic resour ce, or, as a dramati c artist would say, “business”. I knew that the lady had just been walking by the riverside, and I also kne w that kine and horses were at grass in t he fields beyond the hawthorn hedge which ran along one si de of the tow-path. I did not, however, recollect any iron gate or railing. The suggesti on of a hunt was quickly fol lowed up, and I led the way, keeping an eye open in the gathering gloom for indications of som e iron. We had gone about half a m ile when the whinny of a horse was heard, and I laughingl y remarked that that was half the necklace. Co ming up to the place where the horse stood, we found to our immense satisfaction that its nose was resting on a length of iron rail ing which had been introduced to repair a gap in the hedge. We stopped at that, and on striki ng a light, found the broken necklace on the towpath where, in another st ep, we should have crushed it under foot .

We never talk of things being lost nowadays. We sa y they are “unnum bered”, or that “the ticket has come uns tuck”. We fi nd them b y the aid of num bers. Other in cidents connected wi th the power of thought- re ading by num bers will be found in my Manual of Occultism . And now, to dispense with the undesirabl e personal element, let us see how m uch of t he method can be discr eetly comm unicated. On a question arisi ng i n the m ind of a nature which cannot be answered by reference to the ordinary channels or m eans of inform ation, let 9 num bers be set down spontaneously as they occu r, and to these let there be added always the figure 3, whether that figure has been previously em ployed or no t. Make a sum of the 10 figures, and observe the nature of t he fi gures whi ch are represented in the sum . For the interpretation of the num bers I m ust refer the read er to succeeding chapters, as the matter is of some length. The process em ployed is based upon the occult fact that, if the m ind is concerned about a any m atter, the figures that are then automatically delivered by t he m ind bear a direct relationship t o the nature of the thought, and in them selves afford the means of a solution. An instance of this m ay be cited from the Scripture, which the Kabalists have revealed. In the prophecy of Jacob concerning the future of his sons, Judah is referred to as a lion’s w help. “The scep tre shall not depart from Judah, nor t he law- giver from between his feet, until Shil oh shall come”. The sceptre is Regulus the law-giver is Cepheus, 107"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"and Shiloh or Shuleh is Cor Scorpio, whose rising is the signal for Regulus to depart from the m idheaven with its opposition point of Cepheus from the nadir. The last two words of this sentence are given below in Hebrew with their numerical valu es. From this we learn that the spontaneous utterance of the dying pat riarch, “Shiloh shal l come”! contained the num erical revelation of the Messiah. When, therefore, we speak of thought-reading by num bers, we do not refer to th e conscious thought of the transm itter, nor to any special psychic faculty in the percipient, but to the su bconscious thought, or knowledge rather, of the tran sm itter, whose external or attentive m ind is seeking a solu tion; and to the system of num erology which enables that solution to be found either by oneself or another.

Th ere is no re ason why units shoul d not have gone from 1 to 13. The Hebrews may be said to think in twelves but count in tens, and this counting by tens is univers al. Thus, while we have twelve m onths answ ering to the twelve signs, the seven days answering to the seven anciently recognised bodies of the solar system, there is in all Oriental nations a predilection for t he method of counting by tens. This cyclic law has been recogni sed not onl y in science, but also in commerce, finance, and even agriculture. Th e suggesti on, therefore, that events in term s of nine, i s not in itself a very exceptional stat ement. The fact that its application to spe cific ca ses yields results of a surprisingly exact nature, te nds rather to confi rm the view of the Kab alists, who regard the numb er 9 much as the Alchem ists reg arded 129"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"their “Red Dragon” as a specie s of general solvent. Thus, any num ber being reduced to its unit value, as 1911 = 12 = 3, the addition of the num ber 9 will produce the sam e unit value successively as 1920 = 12 = 3, 1929 21 = 3, 1938 =21 = 3, etc.Hence, in the conception of t hose who see significance in n umbers, th e application of any factor to this cyclic series m ust have some special pointing. Such a factor is to be foun d in the num erical value of a person’s name, as we have al ready seen, and this, when applied to the year in which that person was born, or in which any great crisis was re ached, is found to have a kabalistic significance when reduced to term s of the Tarot – a favourite but by no means the onl y m ethod of interpretation. One such kabala occurs to me as worthy of citat ion i n regard to this law of cycles . According to this kabala it was seen that the year 1815 was destined to be one of great significance to the “Little Corporal Violet”. Napoleon was born in 1769, and attained his 46 th year in 1815. If now we add toge ther 1815 and 46 we obtain 1861 = 1+ 8+6+1 = 16. Referring this num ber to the Tarot keys we find No.16 = “The Stricken Tower”, a man falling headlong from an em inence, his crown fal ling in advance of him . It denotes the judgement of Heaven, reversal, danger of ruin, disast er, catastrophe. Cecil Rhodes, the “Colossus” of South Africa, was born in 1853 and attained his 49 th ye ar in 1902. 130"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Then 1902+49 = 1951 = 16, again “The Stricken Tower”! Miss Sophia Hick man, of the Royal Free Hospital, was found poisoned in Richm ond Park in August 1903. She was born on 22 nd June 1874, and entered her 30 th year i n 1903. If to 1903 we add 30, the sum 1933 = 16. M.Carnot, the French President , was born in 1837, a nd i n 1894 attained 57 years of age. Then 1894 + 57 = 1951 = 16. The poet Shelley was born in 1792, and entered his 30 th year in 1822. The year 1822 + 30 = 1852 = 16. It will be seen, therefore, th at this number 16, an d also 13, which is the “Reaper” or “The Reapi ng Skeleton”, i.e Death, are the m ost singularly fatal in the whole 2 2 keys of the Tarot. This cyclic recurrence of certa in like inc idents observed in several cases appears to ha ve led to the constructi on of what are called “Alfridaries”. By these tables it is presumed that the life is subject to successive combinations of planetary in fluence d uring its entire course. The starting poi nt is from the Sun or Moon according to the time of da y at which the birt h took place. If in the afternoon from the Sun, and in the morning from the Moon.

In the numerical system, however, it is different , inasm uch as the progression is m ade not by years only, but by reference to the age a ttained in successive years, and as the Tarot extends only t o 22 poi nts, which is not a multiple of 9, there is not that degree of repetition which characterises the alfridaric prognostics. Thus, a person born in 1864 = 19, Illuminati on , attains the age of 1 year in 1865, t he sum being 1866 = 21; the age of 2 in 1866, the sum 1868 = 23; but as there are only 22 poi nts or keys, 23 will be equal to 1. Then follows the series:- 1867, age 3, sum 1870 = 16 1868, age 4, sum 1872 = 18 1869, age 5, sum 1874 = 20 1870, age 6, sum 1876 = 22 1871, age 7, sum 1878 = 2 1872, age 8, sum 1880 = 17 1873, age 9, sum 1882 = 19 1874, age 10, sum 1884 = 21 1875, age 11, sum 1886 = 1 1876, age 12, sum 1888 = 3 1877, age 13, sum 1890 = 18 1878, age 14, sum 1892 = 20 1879, age 15, sum 1894 = 22 1880, age 16, sum 1896 = 2 etc. This idea of the cy clic law, or law of periodicity, has arrested the attention of sc ientists, am ong whom we may cite Mendelieff, who has shown 133"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"that the atom ic weights of th e elements follow the natural octave; and Sir Will iam Crookes, whose Genesis of the Elements develops the same idea in regard to the differentiation of protyle via the hydrogen base by a graduation of the vi bration frequency and a proporti onate diminishing of the mean free path or play-space of the various atom s. Then, again, the research es of Prof. Ray Lancaster in regard to suns pot s has show n that the solar disturbances co me sporadically, i.e. in g roups, at d efinite and well-defined periods. It ha s been shown, too, that these periods correspond to peri ods of famine, etc. Periodicit y is, of course, at the base of planetary motions, and therefore also of cos mic ch anges. In hum an life we observe that there is a t endency of any action to automatically repeat itself, so that wh at was prim arily a voluntary act tends to fall into the region of the automatic, and so become a habit. Let us suppose that nature has a habi t of pr ocedure peculiar to its constitution, then it will, in effect, observe a course which reveals a periodic law, another name for numerical sequence. We call it a law because it responds to a numerical sequence, not b ecause we pretend to an understanding of i ts causation. But we really have no need to cite a suppositi tious case, for we well know that nature has such a habitual course as that suggested, and this is at t he root of t he vaticinations of the astrol ogers. Lunations and eclipses run in cycles, as also do th e conjunctions and opposit ions of the planets of the 134"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"system. There is the 19 year cy cle of the lunation, at the end of which they recur in the sam e part of the zodiac – that is to say, at the sa me distance fro m the equinox on the same day of the year. If any effects of a physical nature can be rightly attributed to the com bined action of the lumin aries, then such e ffects will follow a cyclic repetition every nineteen ye ars. The phenom enon of the tides is, I think, sufficiently obvious to be accepted as a basis of our argument without dissent. But we have no reason to suppose that Nature ceases to exist where w e cease to perceive her; indeed , the revelations of m odern science during the pa st twenty years sufficiently attest th e folly of a ccepting t he ordinary sense perception as the criterion of evidence. That bein g so, we are entitled, by a philosophical consideration of the relations of noumen a and phenomena, to posit a possible ext ension of tidal influence into the domain of phreno-psychic functions. And if the luminaries so act to produce visible effects in the physic al world, and appreciable effects also in the super-physical world, we may argue si milarly in regard to the conj unctions and opposi tions of other bodies of our system, si nce we ar e well assured of its solidarity. Then the conjunctions of Mars an d Mercury, of Jupi ter and Saturn, of Saturn and Mars, etc., will have their specific effects in the econom y of the system ; and thi s brings us immediately to the fact of periodicity in natural phenom ena. For if a conjunction of Mars and Mercury takes place in a particular part of the zodi ac today, it will again have place in the same 135"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"cel estial region at the end of every succes sive period of 79 years; and sim ilarly with th e other planets, as Saturn and Mars i n 30 years, Jupiter and Saturn in 60 years, and so of the rest, some bei ng of greater frequency and less effect, others of less fre quency and proportionately greater ef fect, according to their distances from the Sun and their conseque nt velocities. Now, since the periodic tim es of the planets bear a definite known ration to thei r distances fro m the centre, Nature is seen to observe quantitive relations; which is actually what we look for in, a s define as, cosm ic law. Without t his regard to num bers, the cosm os would be chaotic and unintelligible to us. But it is so well sustained by its laws, and so thoroughly harm onious in its relations, that we are able to say to within a m inute of space wh ere any celestial body will be found hundreds or thousa nds of years hen ce, and where it was as many years ago. But what of those radiant bodies which occasionally make in cursion to our system, the co mets and the star showers?

The ma rket value of any ki nd of ability is, of course, determ ined by the econom ic law of suppl y and dem and, and a m an of exceptional abil ity i n some particular field of wo rk will find little call for his labours. It is not so m uch th at they are not wanted, but that he lacks the f aculty o f creating a d emand by im pressing others of their need for his work. The man who discovered the proce ss of m aking magnesia by the ton ought to have been wo rth a m illion pounds at least. The fact that he died a poor man does not detract from his chem ical ability; it only shows that he lacked th e commerci al instinct, a co mmo n defect of the real student in any departm ent of kn owledge. There are, however, other and m ore subt le causes at work to produce failure of this sort where success of another sort is conspicuous. Every man is, in fine, a Num ber. He is em bodied num ber. That is to say, the mass-chord of his whole 138"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"constitution is in te rm s of a single digit, to which he answers in the gamut of life. If, for instance, his numb er is 3, then he is in sym pathe tic vibratory relations with all others whose num ber is 6, and in syntinic relations with those whose num ber is 3. But he would be in discordant relations with all men whos e num ber is 5. Now let u s suppose, as our kabala indeed suggests, that the number 3 answers t o the theological, an d that 5, in ter ms of the sam e kabala, answers to the co mmercial. We can understand at once the funda mental difference existing between these natures. Agai n, let 9 respond t o and represent the executive faculty , then we may expect an affinity or sym pathetic relationshi p with 5, the commercial faculty. Our kabala inform s us that 9 and 5 are in such relations. Sim ilarly, in regard to 3, which denotes inc rease, expansion, optim ism, and gr owth, and 8, which denotes decrease, privation, destru ction, loss, and pessi mism, they are in opposi tion, and are m utually destructive. Consequently, we may derive some benefit of a pra ctical nature from the measure of our own selves, and an understanding of the faculty we are designed to re present in the econom y of life. If the nam e of a person shoul d appear too slender an argumen t for differences of faculty and functi on, differences of fo rtune and of character, then let the date of birth stand as sym bol of the man – without reference to his potential or m easure of power, but merely in regard to his domin ant charact eristic and faculty. 139"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"If we find it answers, as m ust be the cas e where the kabalism is truely made, then it will afford an immediate key, not only to the character of the m an, but also to the means by which he can most effectively pursue the lin e of least res istance, an d so make the greatest progress. For it will be seen at once that he is not li kely to prosper or effectively work out hi s destiny i n association with persons whose key num ber is opposed to his own; and on the contrary, he will im prove his fort unes and rei nforce his powers by uni ting his effort s to those of others whose key num ber is the sam e, or at least of a sy mpat hetic nature. Thus, a man born under the si gnature of Mars and the num ber 9, would blight hi s prospects by alliance with one born under Mercury and the num ber 5. But it is perhaps a waste of words to argue each case on its own merits, and the ground can be covered by a single tabular statement of the symp athies and antipathies represented by the key num ber of an indivi dual. This num ber, I need hardly add, is t he result of adding together the day, month, and y ear of birth. In this scheme the year is generic, the month specific, and the day individuali stic. For t here are many thousands born e very year, about one twelfth being born in each m onth; while a com parative few come out under the particular day, still fewer in any hour, and less still in any m inute.

It has already been shown how the smaller periods of time are calculated from the planetary days and hours, and hence we may say that the line of demarcation is fairly well defined in every case. Thus, a person born on Tuesday, 26 th April 1910, at 4.05 in the afternoon, would be primarily under the dom inance of the pla net Mars Tuesday; in a m ore intim ate sense under the planet Venus, governi ng the hour, and specifically under t he influence of the Moon, which governs the exact m inute of the birth. From these elements we have the figures 532, all being negative, and the sum of these is 10 = 1, which is the key num ber of that individual. This m ethod will be found more ex act and rep resentative even than the kabala o f the Tabl e of Three already d ealt with in these pag es.

We have seen that unity = 1 can be expressed in term s of a n indefini te state of eternal becom ing, as when 1 = .9 to infinit y. It is also possible to say 1 = 1 + x, where x is an infinit e potential. For aught we know, the am oeba is potential man. Natu ral history seems to lend colour to t he conception of a continual progression in t he scale of evolut ion. We do not know how inorganic matter becom es organic, how the m ineral b eco mes translated into the vegetable and the vegetable into the anim al, but here and there we find exam ples of the transition. We cover the whole ground of m anifold creation by a single word when we speak of differentiation, and the whole process of i nfini te progression of the form s of life when we define evolution. At the root of all is the one Life, the one Substance, the one Great In telligence, from which all proceeds and to which all aspires. 143"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Quantitive relations have no fi xed value. Before we can say 2+ 2 = 4 we have to pos it a qualitative value which has regard to the nature of things thus put together. Her e we are giving t o numbers som ething m ore than the power to express quantitive rela tions, we are giving them a qualitative value. We exercise this discrim ination when we seek to form a cricket team or an ei ght-oar crew. It is not m erely a questi on of 11 men or 8 men, but of 11 cricketers and 8 oars men. Hence it is not t he fact that 11 men make a cricket team. They must first learn to play cricket. Moral values attach to num bers quite as m uch as d o exchange values. Shakespear e expressed this fact in the saying: “He is well paid wh o is well satisfied”. One can give a small boy a penny and a workman a shilling and get m ore work in exchange from the boy while giving equal satisfaction to both. Yet the needs of the m an in a given time are not eleven times greater than those of the boy in the same time. Hen ce the penny and the shilling obtain a moral value in additio n to their exchange value. Each is a token, and intri nsically of equal value in certain circum stances, so that 1 = 1 + 11 is a possible expression of fact. Nature has m ore reg ard to pot entiality than to potency, to future possibilities than to present circumstance. Consequently, we find that he r expressi ons of val ue are not fixed, but have alwa ys a cumulative adjunct represented by +x n , which we understand to mean indefinite evolution – as, for example, Adam=1+4+4=9+x n 144"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"When the poet speaks of “t he diapason closing strong i n man”, we apprehend his m eaning but di sagree as to his values. He leaves out of sigh t the fact that Nature as instrument is not affected by the lim itations tha t are im posed upon ourselves, and th at the divine harmony is not realised in m an as we know him , because he is not a plenary expression of the soul of the Great Performer . The theme, if pursed to its logical conclusion, will bring us again to the fact that a ll values are relative, and since we are mainly concerned in this place with numbers as expressions of hum an relations – t hat is, with their sym bolical values – we may pursue the study along these lines to greater advantage. That perspicuous thinker and fi ne poet, George Macdonald, LL.D., in his Phantastes , has this pertinent passage:- “They who believe in the influence of the stars over the fates of m en, are, in feeling at least, near er th e truth than they who regard th e heavenly bodies as related to them merely by a co mm on obedience to an ext ernal law. All that man sees has to do with man. Worlds cannot be without an inter-munda ne relationshi p. The comm unity of the centre of all creation suggests an inter- radiating connection and dependence of th e parts. Else a grander idea is conceivable than that which is already em bodied.

No shining belt or gle aming moon, no red and green glor y in self encircling twin- stars, but has a relation to the hidden t hings of a man’s soul, and, it m ay be, with the secret history of his body as well. They are portions of the living house wherein he abides”. This thought is a very vital on e. It suggests the concept of the idealist that nothing exists for us save in our consciousness,, all things bein g related to us through our senses and our thought s. Whatever affects the consciousness affects the man, and in an i ntimat e s ense is man, as Henry Sutton ha s so well expressed it:- “Man doth usurp all space, Stares thee in rock, bush, river, in the face; Never y et thine eyes beheld a tr ee; ‘Tis no sea thou seest in the sea ‘Tis but a disguised hum anity. To avoid thy fellow, vain thy pl an; All that interests a man is man. These lines have the endorse ment of George Macdonald, who quot es them in his Fairie Roma nce with evident appreciation. The idea of all Nature being a “di sguise d hum anity” is excellent, the phrase unique, and we, as students of the book of God’s revelation, have to fi nd the story of man’s origin, history, and developm ent in the world about us, as well distant as near.

Thus we get a new value for the nu mber 8 and the planet Saturn, which stand as sym bols of pri vation. We see them as t he cause of all st riving, and, in effect, 8 = evolution; and si nce evolution involves growth, expansion, development, the expression and realisation of potentia l faculty, we find that 8 is potentially 3. In a universe wher e everything is in a state of flux, where the status quo is an unstab le equilibrium, we find that reaction is the law.

Let us trace this influence in term s of cosm ic law. The pl anet Saturn was in the sign Sagittarius in the year 1898. For many centuries prior to t his date it had be en known by observation that this sign of the zodiac “governed” Spain. Not that any disrespect was in tended to t he king, or even to Don Caesar de Bazan, but th at the fortunes of that country were found to answer to the affections of that sign by the successive incursi ons of t he various pl anets – as was noted by Kepler, who f ound it not beneath him to confess that “A m ost unfailin g experience of the course of hum an events in harm ony with the changes occurring in the heavens has inst ructed and co mpelled my unwilling belief”. In 1898, therefore, we find Spain, in strict agreemen t with thi s dictum , suddenl y pl unge d into a m ost unexpected and unfortunate wa r with the United States of America. “Spanish Fours” went down with a run on the Stock Exchange, and thousands of Spanish holders of the Government Stock were ruined. Spain lost her possessions in the West Indies and the Philippines, and a heavy indem nity was im posed when finally it capitulated. Altogether, some 100,000 men were killed during the hostilities. It was a black h our for Spain indeed. Since then the Spanish “Maine” has had a new meaning, for i t has been offi cially ascertained by t he salving of the American war-vessel that it was 148"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"not blown up by any Spaniard , but exploded from its own magazines , the explosion taking place from within and not out side of the vessel. There was, therefore, no adequate casus belli, and if we could e lim inate Saturn and the number 8 from the si gn Sagittarius in the year 1898 = 1+8+9+8 = 26 = 8, we shoul d fi nd no reason to suspect that there might be on e. Yet it is significant that the present writer specifically predic ted this great struggle between America and Spain, the concom itant rise in the price of wheat, the loss of life and territory sustained by Spain, and t he reconstruction of it s Government Stock in the following year. The Russo-Japanese war took place in 1905, and was sim ilarly attended by the t ransit of Saturn through Russia’s ruling sign Aquarius. The prediction of its defeat was an easy matter to those instructed in natural symbolism, and the revolution, also specifically predicted, was the result of Saturn a nd Mars being conjoined in Aquarius. When Saturn passed into Pi sces, which rules Portugal, the unrest and dissatisfaction of the populace found signal expression in the assa ssination of the King and Crown Prince, and was shortl y fol lowed by the revoluti on, due to the conjunc tion of Sat urn and Mars as before, which deposed the m onarchy. Now, if we look at t he corre spondi ng values of the chief securities of these countries, we shall find that they reflect the “depressi on” of the public m ind due to the influence of Saturn.

Portuguese 3 per cent st ock stood at 72 in 1906, and the i nfluence of Saturn wa s such as to bring the value down to 58 in 1908. Japan, ruled by Libra, shows no correspondi ng depreciation as did Russia fro m influence of Saturn, for in 1906 the 4.5% (1 905) Bonds stood at the highest poi nt of over 97 since the date of issue, and in 1910, when Jupiter = 3 (increase and expansion) w as in Libra, the price went up to over 102.

It is the recurrence of these planetary periods and luni -solar cycles that constitutes the e bb and flow of hum an affairs and the corresponding changes or fluctuat ions in val ues.

Num bers are a key to this expression, but they do not i nform us as to indivi dual attribut es or inherent powers.

The law of evolut ion is cyclic or periodic, it is never re trogressi ve, but always progressive. The spiral cour se of a gravitating body has given rise to the idea am ong superficial observers that hum anity retrogresses or c ontinually pursues the sam e unchanging orbit.

Th is clearly shows that he was a deductive philosopher, arguing from universals to particulars. He further shows that light in the physic al world, intelligen ce in the spiritual world, and science in the social world are correspondences . Further, he shows that the mathematical point , the physical atom , and the spiritual monad are correspondences. This infe rs somet hing mo re than a mere analogy or sim ilitude. It argues a direct interaction or continuity the one with th e other. It means, in fact, that the physical atom is the ultim ate expression of the spirit ual m onad, and that wit hout the l atter there could be no physical existence whatsoever, since the physical universe i s the bodying forth of the spirit ual. Hence physically we have the atom , intellectually the poi nt, and spiritually the m onad . This m onad is the divine spark or scintilla in the hum an being, th e “light that lighteth every man when he co met h into the world”. Astronom ically this m onad is the Sun, t he centre and source of l ife and li ght to our system of worlds. It is the ultim ate manifestation of the Central Fact of Being, the manifestation to us of th e divine Wisdom and Love. Without its continual radiation the worlds would be but barren wilderness and lifeless orbs revolving in space. Indeed, they could hardly be said to exist as worlds. So without 163"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"the Wisdom and Love of God directing and vitalisi ng the hum an soul it could produ ce nothing of good and would be but the play of natural fo rces. But inas much as this play of na tural forces is nothing but an e xpression of the Divine Will, even they could not be said to exist apart from the Source of their expression. Thus we see how Bruno ri ghtly apprehended the spiritual signi ficance of the physic al facts of the unive rse, and how he regarded the integrity of things to consist in their di vine dependence. Because o f this esse ntial unity of all things the num ber One has come to be invested in all kabalistic system s with singular and even divi ne attribut es. Thus we see how in the universal system 1 sym bolises m anifestation from zero 0, the positive and active principle in all form s of life. It stands also for t he Logos, which is the manifestation in ti me and space to us of the Divine Unm anifest Being. It represents also i ndivi dualit y; in a religious sense the Lord, and in a scientific sense the underlyi ng unity of t hings. A sym bol of the Sun. In the Tarot it indicates “the Magnus”, which is a sym bol of the Creator, who produces the universe by the magical power of His ideation. Even the Ephesians, punctilious in all the ex ternals of religion, erected an altar “ to the Unknown God”, fearing lest i n the const ruction of their pantheon they had ignoran tly om itted one to whom recognition was due; and it w as the custom am on g the ancients either to add or re mit one from the allotted num ber. Thus there came to be “luck in odd num bers” of which one was 164"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"the first and m ost significant. These are ideas which, as Bruno said, “germ inate like amputated roots, ancient trut hs which are again unfolded, occult verities that are now revealed, constituting a new light t hat during the long ni ght has been hidden beneath the horizon of our consci ousness, and n ow, little by little, makes its way towards the m eridian of our intelligence”. For these truths were expressions of t he Soul of T hings, in which t he philosopher had im plicit faith, for always beyond the thing of form he be held the soul of it, which was its i mperishable part. Thus he speaks of t he Soul of the Worl d as “the form al constitutive principle of th e world and of all that it contains; for all things, although not anim al, are anim ate”. And this doctrine is again and again repeat ed in the various works of this intuitive thinker, as in the Ceneri , where it is said: “Everything participates in Life, there are innum erable lives not only in us but in all com posite bodies, and when we regard a thing which is said to be dying, we should rather understand t hat it changes, and that t here is an end to that acci dental com positi on and configuration, whilst there yet remain those things that are incorrupt and for ever i mmortal. ....Nothing is ever annihilated or lost to being save th e accidental, exterior, and material form it holds”. Concerning Matter itself, Br uno held that it was eternal and indest ructible as to its essence, though evanescent and m utable as to form : “A ll the difference that we se e in bodies i s in regard 165"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"to their form , co mplexion, constitution, and other properties and relationships, which is nothing m ore t han a different m ode of the same substance, the unchangeable and eternal essence in which are all forms, constitutions, and m embers, unm anifest and hom ogeneous”. From the Spirit, which is the life of the universe, proceed the life and soul of whatsoever is livi ng and ensoul ed and understood to be imm ortal, as also are all the bodies as to their subst ance, being not otherwise dead save in that they are subject to dispersion and aggregation, which is clearly expressed in Ecclesi astes: “That which is to b e hath already been, verily th ere is nothing new under the sun”. For Bruno spoke of sponta neous generation, of the origi n and transform ation of the species, in a manner that was foreign to the thought of his times. Bruno was enabled to anti cipate much of m odern scientific and philosophical thought solely becau se h e had studied a pure Kabalism, which recognised Num ber as im plicit in all the works of the Spirit. Consequently, he protests against “the foolis h and unreasoning i dolaters”, meaning of course those w ho upheld the crass orthodoxy of his day in Europe, who, he affirm ed, “have no cause to deride the magic and the di vine cult of the Egyptians, which in all things and in all effects, according to th e scope of each, contempl ated the Divine....They knew, did those sages, that God was in all thi ngs a nd that di vinit y was latent in Nature”.

For the reversion of man to th e Divine is through Nature to Nature’s God by means of c ontem plation. It is not then enough that we study to know the relations of things them selves to one another, but we m ust study the relations of things in them selv es to the source of their existence. As in music the tones bear a cert ain proportional relativity to one another with out violating the sense of harm ony, irrespective of the exact num ber of vibrations constituting the tonic, so the whole universe em bodies a certain relativity of its part s, irrespective of the exact measurement of any one of its bodies. Thus a stringed instrument ma y be raised or lowered in pitch without in any way affe cting its m anipulation or the relative value of its notes. Si milarly the distances of the planets from the Sun may be increased o r reduced from what we now assume them to be, without i n the least affecting our astronom y or altering i n any way the relative d istances of the various bodies from their comm on centre.

If two observers look at the sam e body in space fro m two widely sundered points of view, their lines of vision will intersect one another at an angle wh ich is proporti onate to the distance of the body – the nearer the body t he greater the angle. This angle is called Parallax, and by knowing this angle a nd the distance between the observers we can find the length of t he perpendicular which bisects it and the angle of Parallax, and this length will be the distance of the body from the Earth. Let A and C be the observe rs, and B the body in space. Then the angles at A and C are known by observation, and thence is derived the angle at B. Having the two angles and the base we can find the other sides and also the length of the perpendicular 168"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"BD, which is the distance of the body B.

And if we take th e physical fact that all bodies at 37 times their own diameters from the eye appear to the spectator as of equal size, then some of our noti ons about the distance of bodies in space will have to be revised. Rel ative truths are all that we can h ope for in regard to anythi ng in this universe, since everythi ng is conditioned by our own consciousness and sense lim itations, but the relations of our perceptions should nevert heless be true. This relativity of percepti on and apprehension of the universe about us puts us in the position of interpre ters. We take the phenomenon as a signal, and from a series we establish a code which thereafter we apply to a variety of different sets of phenomena. This constitutes our science. Kabalism in th e same manner establishes a certain relativity between num bers, which we regard as the quantitive relations of things, and thence arises a system of interpretation whic h is capable of a universal application.

On the other hand, it may sym bolise Deity, the universe, ego, the atom, the m onad, or aught else that in itself is a sole entity. There is thus a relativity in Unity as well as essential identity, although in things of a kind relativity is usually regarded as beginni ng with T wo. For we see that the atom is related to the individual, and the indivi dual to the universe, and the universe to its Lord, who is in sole relations with the Un manife st Deity, the Absolute or Zero, 0. There are what Swedenborg would call “di screte degrees” between each of th ese existences. But if we have two atom s or two egos , two m onads, etc., the two are on the same plane of exis tence as one another, and are therefore continuous of each other, as to the plane of their existence, while remain ing separate entities, which is what Swedenborg calls a “continuous degree”. Now as al l planes are in cont inuity, as required by their existence as planes, we may sa y that m atter is continuous of matter throughout the universe, that m ind is continuous of m ind, and spirit of spi rit. Furt her, from what we have already argued about discrete degrees, we are able to say that matter is the substratum of m ind, as mind is of spirit, and spir it of Deity. Moreover, the doctrine of the Immanence of God requires that He is present in all His creations, not immediately as oxygen in air, but mediately as the will and consciousness are in the body of m an. Therefore 170"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"by a variety of dependencies, all existences up on all planes are linked together, and together constitute the body of G od. Thus when we speak of the Living God we should understand that conscious Will which is the life of the universe and expressed in all its operations, relations, and condit ions. But even so we are at liberty to reflect that this universe of ours is but an infinitesimal part of the existent, and ought therefor e to be re garded rather as a m olecule belongi ng to the Corpus Dei and not the entire body. Here we com e at once to the m onadology of Leibnitz, which was so full y appr ehended by Bruno as to constitute an essen tial part of his philosophy. In this system of thought w e regard every part, every atom, as reflecting every ot her part of the body to w hich it belongs, and therefore every universe com es to be a reflex of the Divine, as if a light falling upon a crystal sphere should illum inate th e entire sphere and therefore all of its parts or molecules, and thus t here would be a myriad molecules, each consisting of m illions of atom s, all illum inated from a single source of light; and, mirabile dictu, every atom is a sphere in itself. If we now take the idea of continuity in matter we shall find that it can only be worked out on t he principle of the hexagon. No other form is ca pable of affording contact with an equal num ber of unit s of the same form and size as itself. There is a magic in the num ber Six which enters freely into all Nature.

It was at once seized upon by the Herm etic philosophers to indicate the totality of things. Ir became related to the Sabbath, and was used to signi fy fulness and com pletion. So a week was made to consis t of seven days, and a great cycle of seven m illennium s. The Kabalists brought it out from the Oriental m ysteries to typi fy t he seven creative forces, the three l ords with their s’aktis – Brah ma, Vishnu, S’iva – Saraswati, Lakshm i, Parvati. They sym bolised the sol ar system under a glyph, which em ployed the seven bodies know n at that time.

The sym bols were repeated in the seven lam ps and the branches of the golde n candlestick. The septenary idea is indigenous to the Hebraic system , and is found in evidence at all st ages of its development, from th e Chaldean conception of the Cr eation to the establishing of the Covenant and the bui lding of the Tem ple. There can be little doubt that the cerem onial of the Jews was based upon astronom ical ideas then current, and St Paul bears testim ony to this in speaking of the ordinances of Moses and the construction of the Tab ernacl e, which h e says was ordained “after the pattern of things in the heavens”. The leper was told by Elijah to wash him self seven tim es in the river Jordan – a cryptic sym bol of the Gilgaluth or cyclic law of rebirth, the name Jordan signi fying River of Knowledge. David the King prays that his soul m ay be “tried as silver is tried and seven times purified in the furnace of earth”. For it appears that the Hebrews believed that in carnations were necessary until the seven stages of purif ication had been effected . The furnace of earth is of course the material body, and the silver thrown in to it for the purpose of purificati on is the human soul, typified by the Moon, which rules silver. Sim ilarly we have the perfec tion of thi ngs indicated by stages of seven tim es seven, wh ich is the Hebrew jubilee – though for som e reason un known we have adopted the custom of celebrating the jubil ee at the end of the fiftieth 174"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"year, instead of the end of th e forty-nint h or beginni ng of the fiftieth, - and we find th at “seven times s even ” and “seventy times seven” ar e numbers that indicate com pleteness and perfection, a Sabbath of Sabbaths.

In connection with the subject of the Gilgaluth or cyclic revoluti ons of t he human soul , we have to em ploy the sym bols of the Sun and Moon as representing spirit and matter, or the natural elements of fire and water. “Except ye be born of water and the Spirit, ye cannot enter the kingdom of God”, is in thi s sense apposit e. The num bers of the Sun and Moon are re spectively 36 and 28, which being m ultiplied into one another yield 1008, a num ber of considerable astronom ical im portance; and one- seventh of this is 144, whic h is, as we have seen, the num ber of the Man “of the fulness of the sta ture of Christ” an d the original type Adam is en umerated thus in the Hebrew Kabala – A1, D4, M4, or 144, which i s 12 x 12, the measure of the New Jer usalem. Thus we see how the One is m anifest i n the Six, and how the One working i n and t hrough the Six produces the fulness of perfection and the “fulfilling of the law”.

The total of these years is 4,320,000 solar years. The Brah mi c Day t herefore b ears a definite relationshi p to the Dvapara Yug a and to the Satya Yuga. Als o we observe that the half of the Great Year of Plato (25,920 years) is 12,960 years, which is the one hundredt h part of the Treta Yuga. So that there can be very little doubt that these astronom ical periods of t he ancients are all li nked up together in such manner as to form a com plete system of astronom ical chronol ogy. The difficulty is to trace them to their source. It is of course observed that they are formed on a num erical progression of 1234 = 10, and that the sum of the four ages is 10 tim es the value of the first, as 432,000 and 4,320,000. This would be t he case with any numerical series in the ratio of 1234. I t hink, however, that the basis of the system is to be found in the m ultiple of 72, that being the num ber of years in which the precession of the equinoxes am ounts to one degree of the ecliptic. There are 60 m inutes in 1 degree and 60 x 72 = 4320, which 177"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"gives us t he basis of the y ugas. Also 6 times 60 = 360, the num ber of degrees in the circle, and 6 tim es 4,320 = 25,920, which is the Great Year. That which was know as the Naros of 600 years, dur ing which one of the twelve manifestations of the Deity was presu med to rule on the Earth, gives us the value 600 x 12 = 7200 years, and 60 times this is 432,000 years, which is t he length of the Kali Yuga. Thes e in quiries ar e extremely interesting to pursue. The anci ents knew of a moti on of the Earth’s axis which had reference to the obliquity of the ecliptic, and they appear to have used these ag es in order to indicate the times duri ng which t he pole of the Earth passed through a definite num ber of degrees. The belief is supported by th e observati ons of various astronom ers such as Herschel, Maskelyne, and others, who have shown that the diminuti on am ounts to half a second per year of fifty seconds per century, and t his is exactly one hundredt h of the precession of the equinoxes. If therefore we take the progre ssion of 1, 2, 3 times the value of t welve revoluti ons of the circle = 360 x 12, we shall get the basic value of the cycle 4320 years x 1, 2, 3, thus: - 1 = 4,320 years 2 = 8,640 years 3 = 12,960 years  -------- Total 25,920 years which is the Great Year , the entire precessional 178"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"revoluti on and the value of six cycles of 4320 years.

There may possibly be other grounds for deri ving the cycle first of all referred to , namely, the Brah mic Age, but the above appears to m e to be the m ost likely, and the correspondences are too clos e to be overlooked even by those who have a scientifically educated dislike for “round figures”. Neve rtheless, so far as the precessional increment is concerned, ther e is nothing whatsoever to show that the present rate of precession is constant. It is estimated at 50.2453 seconds , but the records clearly show that it was form erly less than now. Probably a consideration of t he true cause of precession will lead eventually to the fact that the variation is plus up to a certain point in the solar or bit and afterwards m inus, and the m ean will be fifty seconds exactly. This would answer exactly to the theory of Kepler, in which the elliptical orbit requ ires that the Sun has an aphelion and peri helion of it s own, and that its m otion i n space is therefore variabl e, being greatest at the perihelion and least at the ap helion, as is the cas e with the planets of this system and also of the satellites.

If the theory of the continuous change in the obliquity of the ecliptic, due to the Earth’ s gradual change of axial inclination, be true, it will fo llow that at one time the axis must have been in the plane of the orbit, and the polar regions w ould have marked alternations of summer and winter, such as the planet Mars now undergoes from the sam e cause, and the equatorial belt of the Earth m ust then have been one perpet ual ice-belt. At the present time, when the axis is a ssuming the perpendicular, we get a m ore uniform distribution of the Sun’s rays throughout the year over th e whole surface of the globe; but the ideal condition from the point of view of haditability will be when the ax is is quite vertical to the plane of the orbit, for th en there will be no differenc e between summer an d winter in any particular latitude. Another point of c onsiderabl e interest is left out of account in the earlier pages of this work when citing Bode’s Law (p. 72). The discussion of t he point di d not seem apposite to the matter i mmediately in hand, but it may here be dealt with in co nnection with the cosm ical facts we are considering. The proportionate vectors of the planets, excepting Mercury, etc., are given on t he basis of a progressi on of 3(2 n-2 ) + 4, from which we see that the Earth equals 10. Neptune is om itted from this series, but it m ay be added by doubling the figures 180"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"for Uranus and adding 4, thus 192 x 2 = 384, to whi ch 4 being added we get 388 as the value for Neptune. The actual distance of the body i s usually given as 2760 millions of m iles from the Sun, and this would work out at 300 tim es the vector of the Earth. This clearly shows that Bode’s Law is but an approxim ation which would work out if the sizes of t he various bodies were proporti onate to their veloc ities as these are to their distances from the centre. Bu t Neptune is affected by Jupiter and Saturn as well as by Uranus, and the net result is that it is m uch nearer than is required by the la w above cited. When, however, we co me to c onsider the planet itself we find that it is in a state of chaos, not far rem oved from nebulosi ty, and so rem ote from the Sun as to be in these conditions quite uninhabitable unless we presum e, as we certainly have cause to do, th at it has a dense atm osphere, and therefore is cap able of ret aining the heat gen erated from itself. It woul d then only require that the bodies upon it should be tenuous and of small gravity, and there would the n be nothing against its habitability. Indeed, it seem s part of Nature’s econom y to conti nue to open up in space new centres of activity in preparation for the advent of man in proportio n as the planets nearest the Sun become from t heir age and proxim ity to the Sun, gradually less suited to the habitation of man. On these grounds we have ev ery reason to regard with respect the an cient Puranic c oncept of the Laya Centres or vort ices from which the 181"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"worlds are evolved. The gamu t of the solar system is raised a tone without the relativ ity of its parts being at all affected. I t is even possible that the discarnate humanity of this system will find new habitations in the planets which are ex-Saturnian.

We have only to assume, as I thi nk we may, that the Sun has a direct pull on the body somewhat greater than that of the Earth, and we at once see that at the conjunction, when the satellite is between the Sun and the Earth, the former pulls it a little out of its course, so that at no successive revoluti on does it return to the same relative position a s regards our globe, but is always being urged towa rds a wider orbit a nd a commensurately slower velocity as requi red by Kepler’s law.
