A SYSTEM of religious philosophy, or more properly of theosophy, whioh has not only exercised for hundreds of years an extraordinary influence on the mental development of so shrewd a people as the Jews, but has captivated the minds of some of the greatest thinkers of Christendom in the sixteenth and seventeenthoenturies, claims the greatest attention of both the phjJ.osopher and the theologian. When it is added that among its captives were Raymond Lully, the celebrated scholastic, metaphysician and chemist (died 1815); John Reuohlin, the renowned scholar and reviver of oriental litera- ture in Europe (born 1455, died 1522); John Pious di Mirandola, the famous philosopher and classical scholar (l463-H94); Cornelius Henry Agrippa, the distinguished philosopher, divine and physioian(1486-1535); John Baptist von Belmont, a remarkable chemist and physician (1577- 1644) ; as well as our own oountrymen Robert Fludd, the famous physician and philosopher (1574-1637), and Dr. Henry More (1614-1687); and that these men, after rest- lessly searching for a scientific system which should disclose to them \" the deepest depths\" of the Divine nature, and show them the real tie which binds all things together, found the oravings . of their minds satisfied by this theosophy, the claims of the Kabbalah on the attention of students in litera- ture and philosophy will readily be admitted.

How can it be otherwise with a theosophy which, we are assured, was born of God in Paradise, was nursed and reared by the choicest of the angelic hosts in heaven, and only held converse with the holiest of man's children upon earth. Listen to the story of its birth. growth and maturity, as told by its followers. The Kabbalah was first taught by God himself to a select company of angels, who formed a theosophie school in Para- dise. After the fall theaiIgellJ most graciously oommunicated this heavenly dootrine to· the disobedient child of earth, to forriish the protoplasts with the means of returning to their pristine Dobility and felicity. From Adam it passed over to Noah, and then to Abraham; the friend of God, who emigrated with it to Egypt, where the -patriarcb allowed a portion of this mysterious doctrine to ooze out. It was in this way that the Egyptians obtained some knowledge of it, and the other Eastern naiion$ could introduce it into their philosophical systems. Moses, whowss learned in all the wisdom of Egypt. was first initiated into. it in the land of his birth, but became most proficient in it during his wanderings in the wilderness, when he not only devoted to it the leisure hours of the whole forty years, but received lessons in it from one of the angels. By the aid of this mysterious science the lawgiver was enabled to solve the difficulties which arose during his management of the Israelites, in spite of the pil- grimages, wars and the frequent miseries of the nation. He covertly laid down the principles of this secret doctrine in the first four books of the Pentateuch, but withheld them \" from Deuteronomy. This constitutes the former the man, and the latter the woman. Moses also initiated the BeTenty eldel'8 into the secrets of this doctrine, and they again trans- rttittedthem frotnhsntl to hand.

It.is for this reason that it is called KaMalak (i'Y ':1i' from- ;:1P to receioe) which prima- rily denotes reception, and then adQctri\"e received lJ!! oral traditio\". The Kabbalah is also called by some~ecret WiBdom (mnO) i'YO~M). because it was only handed down by tradition through the jnitiated, and is indicated in the Hebrew Scriptures by signs which are hidden and unintelli- gible to those who have not been instructed in its mysteries. From the initial letters of this name, this theosophic system is also denominated Grace (l\"n ..... ,-mO) i'17J~n). Vague and, indefinite as this name may seem to the uninitiated, inesmneh as it conveys no idea whatever of the peculiar doctrines of the system, but simply indicates the manner in which they have been iransmitted, it is nevertheless the classical and acknow- ledged appellation of this theosophy. The difference between the word KalJlJalak (m~i' ret:eptio) and the cognate term MtI880rak (m'DO traditio, from 'DO to trammit)-::\"'which denotes tke traditionall!! transmitted various readings of the Hebrew Scriptures-is, that theformer expresses the act 'of receiving, which in this technical sense could only be on the part of one who has reached a certain period. of life, as well as a certain state of sanctity, implying also a degree of secrecy; whilst the latter signifies tke act of giving over, gurrendering, without premising any peculiar age, stage of holiness, or degree of secrecy. The name, therefore, tells us no more than that this theosophy has been received traditionally. To ascertain its tenets we must analyze the system itself or the books which propound it; and to this task we' now betake ourselves.

It, moreover, endeavours to show how it is that the Bible gives names and assigns attributes and a form to so spiritual a Being; how the existence of evil is compatible with the infinite goodness of God, and what is the Divine intention about this creation. In our analysis of the Kabbalistic doctrines on these grand problems, we shall follow the order in which they have been enumerated, and accordingly begin with the lucubrations on the Supreme Being and the Emanations.

This doctrine, however, that everything is in the Deity is not peculiar to 'the Kabbolah, it has been propounded by the Jews from time immemoria\\, before the Kabbalah came into existence, as maybe seen from the following passage in the Midrash. \"The Holy ·One. blessed be he, is the space of the ~lIli\",_, but the universe is not his apace {t:l'mn 1~ c'1l» 'I'll IItl'lPOlll/:ljm 'O'jlr.l).

Hence it is forbidden to represent him by any form, similitude, or even by his sacred name, by a single letter or a single point; and to this the words 'Ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you' (Deut. iv, 15)-i.e. ye have not seen anything which you could represent by any form or likeness- refer. But after he created the form of the Heavenly Man (nN~.v O'N), he used it as a chariot (n~;:)'7;) wherein to descend, and wishes to be called by this form, which is the sacred name Jehovah. He wishes to be known by his attributes, and each attribute separately; and therefore had himself called the God of Mercy, the God of Justice, Almighty, God of Sebaoth, and the Being. He wishes thereby to make known his nature, and that we should see how his mercy and compassion extend both to the world and to all operations. For if he had not poured out his light upon all his creatures, how could we ever have known him? HQw could the words be fulfilled,' The whole earth is full of his glory' (Ise, Vi, 3) ?

We cannot understand more of his nature than the attribute expresses. Hence, when he is di- vested of all these things, he has neither any attribute nor any similitude or form. The form in which he is generally depicted is to be compared to a very expansive sea; for the. waters of the sea are in themselves without a limit or form, and it is only when they spread themselves upon the earth that they assume a form (lWJ'). We can now make the following calculation: the source of the sea's water and the ioater stream proceeding therefrom to spread itself are two. A great reservoir is then formed, just as if a huge hollow had been dug; this reservoir is called sea, and is the third, The unfathomable deep divides itself into seven streams, resembling seven long vessels. The source, the water stream, the sea and the seven streams make together ten. And when the master breaks the vessels which he has made, the waters return to the source, and then only remain the pieces of these vessels, dried up and without any water. It is in this way that the Oause of Causes gave rise to the ten Sephiroth, The Crown is the source from which streams forth an infinite light: hence the name En Soplt (tno l'N) = infinite, by which the highest cause is designated: for it then had neither form nor shape, and there is neither any means whereby to com- prehend it, nor a way by which to know it. Hence it is written, 'Seek not out the things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength: (Ecclus. iii, 21.) He then made a vessel, as small as a point, like the letter'. whioh is filled from this source (i.e. the En 8opll). This is the source of wisdom,wisdom itself (nO~\"), after :which the Supreme Oauseis called' willI/God: Upon this he made a large vessel like a sea, which is called Intelligence em'.:!) :henoe the Dame 'intelligent God;' It must,.how- ever, be remarked that God iswise,andthrollghhiID$elf, for D\""},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"J4 wisdom does not derive its name through itself, but through the wise one who fills it with the light which flows from him, just as intelligence is not comprehended through itself, but through him who is intelligent and fills it with his own sub- stance. God needs onlyjo withdraw himself and it would be dried up. This is also the meaning of the words, ' the waters have disappeared from the sea, and the bed is dry and parched up.' (Job xiv, ll.) The sea is finally divided iuto seven streams, and the seven costly vessels are produced, which are called Greatness (n~\"':l), Judicial Strength (n\":1.:1), Beauty (n'N:ll1), Firmness (n3J), Splendour (\"\"), Foundation (\"0'), and Kingdom (l1l:J~~). Therefore is he called the Great or the Merciful, the Mighty, the Glorious, the God of victory, the Creator, to whom all praise is due, and the Founda- tion of all things. Upon the last attribute all the others are based as well as the world. Finally, he is also the King of the universe, for everything is in his power; he can diminish the number of the vessels, and increase in them the light which streams from them, or reduce, it, just as it pleases him.\" (Sonar, i, 42 0, 43 a, section ~:l.) In another place again the same authority gives the following description of the Deity and the emanation of the SejJ/tirotk. «The Aged of the Aged, the Unknown of the Unknown, has a form and yet has no form. He has a form whereby the universe is preserved, and yet has no form, because he cannot be com- prehended. When he first assumed the form [of the first Sephira], he caused nine splendid lights to emanate from it, which, shining through it, diffused a bright light in all directions. Imagine an elevated light sending forth its rays in all directions. Now if we approach it to examine the rays, we understand no more than that they emanate from the said light. So is the Holy Aged an absolute light, but in himself concealed and incomprehensible.

That they were not created by, but emanated (~~N) from, tke En Soph; the difference between creation and emanation being, that in the former a. diminution of strength takes place, whilst in the latter this is not the case,\" II. That they form among themselves, and with tke En Soph, a strict unity, and .simpJy represent different aspects of one and the seme being, just as the different rays which proceed from the light, and which appear different things to the eye, form only differentmanifeststions of one and the same light, III. That since th~y simply differ from each other as the different colours of the same light,all the ten emanations alike partake of the perfections of the En Sopk; and IV, that, as emana- tions from the Infinite, the Sepltiroth are infinite and perfect like tke En Sopk, and yet constitute the first finite things,\" They are infinite and perfect when the En· 80ph imparts his fulness to them, and finite and imperfect when the fulness is withdrawn from them, so that in this respect . these ten 8epkiroth exactly oorrespond to the double nature of Ohrist,- his finite and imperfect human nature and his infinite and perfect. divine nature.

Now in looking ~. the SepMrotk which constitute the first triad, it will be seen that they represent the intellect; hence this triad is called the Intellectual World (~~!O'O Cr,w).

Each ,\"\"\"; Sephira composing this trinity of triads is, as it were, a trinity in itself. I, It has its own absolute character; II, It receives from above; and III, It communicates to what is below it. Hence the remark, \"Just as the Sacred Aged is represented by the number three, so are all the other lights (8epltiroth) of a threefold nature.\" (Sohal', iii, 288 b.) Within this trinity in each unit and trinity of triads there is a trinity of units, which must be explained before we can propound the Kabbalistio view of the cosmogony. We have seen that three of the SepMrotlt constitute uniting· links between three pairs of opposites, and by this means produce three triads, respectively denominated the Intellectual World, the Sensuous or Moral World, and the Material World, and that these three uniting Sephi1'otlt, together with the one which unites the whole into a common unity, form what is called the Middle Pillar of the Kabbalistie tree. Now from the important position they thus occupy, these SepMroth are synecdochically used to represent the worlds which by their uniting potency they respectively yield. Hence the Sephira, CROWN (in;)),Jrom which the 8ephiroth, WIsDo~r (n~;)n) and INTELLIGENCE (n~':l), emanated, and by which they are also united, thus yielding the Intellectual World, is by itself used to designate the Intellectual World (Y:l~,~n O\"Y). Its own names, however, are not changed in this capacity, and it still continues to be designated by the several appel- lations mentioned in the description of the (first Sephira.

The Creation or the Kabbalistic Cosmogony. Having arrived at tbe highest trinity which comprises all the Sephiroth, and which consists of the Crown, the King, and the Queen, we shall be able to enter into the cosmogony of the Kabbalah. Now; it is not the En Sopk who created the world, but this trinity, as represented in the combination of the Sepbirotk ; or. rather the creation has arisen from the conjunction of the emanations. The world was born from the nnion of the crowned King and Queen; or, according to the language of tbe Kabbalah, these opposite sexes of royalty, who emanated from the En So ph, produced the universe in their own image. Worlds, we are told, were indeed created before ever the King and Queen or the Sephiroth. gave birth to the present state of things, but they could not continue; and necessarily perished, because the En Soph had not yet assumed this human form in its completeness, which not only implies a moral and intellectual nature, but, as conditions of develop- ment, procreation, and continuance, also comprises sexual opposites. This creation, which aborted and wbich bas . been succeeded by the present order of things, is indicated in Gen. xxxvi, 31-40. The kings of Edom, or tbe old kings as they are also denominated, who are here said to ha.ve reigned before the monarchs of Israel, and are mentioned as having died one after the other, are those primordial worlds which were successively convulsed and destroyed; whilst the sovereigns of Israel denote the King and Queen who emanated from the En Sopk, and who have given birth to- and perpetuate the preaent world. Thus we are told:-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"21 \" Before the Aged of the Aged, the Conoealed of the Con- cealed, expanded into the form of King, the-Crown of Crowns [i.e. the first Sepkira], there was neither beginning nor end. He hewed and incised forms and figures into it [i.e. the crown] in the following manner :-He spread before him a cover, and carved therein kings [i.e. worlds], and marked out their limits and forms, but they could not preserve themselves •. Therefore it is written, 'These are the kings that reigned in the land of Edam before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.' (Gen. xxxvi, 31.) This refers to the primordial kings and primordial Israel. All these were imperfect: he therefore removed them and let them vanish, till he finally descended himself to this cover and assumed a form.\" (IdTa Rabba, Sohar, iii, 148 a.) This important fact that worlds were created and destroyed prior to the present creation is again and again reiterated in the Sohar.' These worlds are compared with sparks which :fly out from a red hot iron beaten by a hammer, and which are extinguished according to the distance they are removed from the burning mass. \"There were old worlds,\" the Sohar tells us, \"which perished as soon as they came into existence: . were formless, and they were called sparks. Thus the smith when hammering the iron, lets the sparks fly in all directions. These sparks are the primordial worlds, which could not continue, because the Sacred Aged had not as yet assumed his form [of opposite sexes-e-the King and Queen], and the master was not yet at his work.\" (Idra Suta, Sol tar, iii, 292 lJ.) But .sincenothing can be annihilated-\" Nothing ,perisheth in this world, not even the breath which issues from the . I) The notion, however, that worlds were created and destroyed prior to the present creation, was propounded in the Midrash long before the existence of the Kabbalah. Thus on the verse, \"And God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very good\" (Gen. i, 31), R.

Hence when the question is asked .:» Why were these primordial worlds destroyed?' the reply i~ given-\"Because the Man, represented by the ten Sepkiroth\" was not as yet. The human form contains every thing, and as it did not as yet exist, the worlds were destroyed.\" It is added, \"Still when it is said that they perished, it is only meant thereby that they lacked the true form, till the human form came into being, in which all things are comprised, and which also contains all those forms. Hence, though the Scripture ascribes death (rm.J\"l)to the kings of Edam, it only denotes a sinking down from their dignity, i.e., the worlds up to that time did not answer to the Divine idea, since they had not as yet the perfect form of which they were capable.\" (Idra Babba, Sohar, iii, 135 b.) It was therefore after the destruction of previous worlds, and after the En Sopk or the Boundless assumed the Sephirie form, that the present world was created. \"The Holy One, bleRsed be he, created and destroyed several worlds before the present one was made, and when this last work was nigh com- pletion, all the things of this world, all the creatures of the universe, in whatever age they were to exist, before ever they entered into this world, were present before God in their true form. Thus are the words of Ecclesiastes to be understood , What was, shall be, and what has been done, shall be done.''' (Sokar, iii, 61 b.] ,. The lower world is made after the pattern of the upper world; every thing which exists in the 'upper world is to be found as it were in a copy upon earth; still the whole is one.\" (ibid ii, 20 a.) This world, however, is not a creation ex nikilo, but is simply an immanent offspring and the image of the King and' Queen, or, in other words, a farther expansion or evolution of ~\\ \\ \\ \\"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"23 the Sepkirotk which are the emanations of the En Soph. This is expressed in the Sonar in the following passage-\" The indivisible point [the Absolute], who has no limit, and who cannot be comprehended because of his purity and brightness, expanded from without, and formed a brightness which served\" as a covering to the indivisible point, yet it too could not be viewed in consequence of its immeasurable light. It too expanded from without, ann this expansion was its garment. Thus everything originated through a constant upheavingagi- tation, and thus finally the world originated.\" (Sohar, i, 20 a.) The universe therefore is an immanent emanation from the Sephiroth, and reveals and makes visible the Boundless and the Concealed of the Concealed. And though it exhibits the Deity in less splendour than its parents the Sephiroth, because it is further removed from the primordial source of light, yet, as it is God manifested, all the multifarious forms in the world point out the unity which they represent; and nothing in it can be destroyed, but everything must return to the source whence it emanated. Hence it is said that\" all things of which this world consists, spirit as well as body, will return to their principal, and the root from which they proceeded.\" (Sonar, ii, 218 b.) \"He is the beginning and end of all the degrees in the creation. All these degrees are stamped with his seal, and he cannot be otherwise described than by the unity. He is one, notwithstanding the innumerable forms which are in him.\" (Ibid i, 21 a.) Now these Sephiroth, or the World 0/ Emanations (C~'Y n'~'::lN), or the Atzil{ltic World, gave birth to three worlds in the following order :-From the conjunction of the KING and QUEEN (i.e., the ten Sephiroth) proceeded-I. The World of Creation, or the Briatic World (nN'l':ln O~'Y), also called The Throne (NiDi':!), which is the a~\"'( of pure spirits, and which, like its parents, consists of ten Bwhirotk, or Emanations. The Briatic World, again, gave rise to,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"24 II. The World of Formation, or the Jetziratic World (m~'M 0;'.11), which is the habitation of the angels, and also consists of ten Sephirotk; whilst the Jetziratic World, again, sent forth, III. The World of Action, or tke A.ssiatie World (M'TV.11M O~'W), also called tke World of Kelipkotk (0;'.11 n,g'~pM), which contains tke Spheres (C'~,)~,) and matter, and is the residence of the Prince of Darkness and his legions. Or, as the Sokar describes it- H After the Sephirotk, and for their use, God made the Throne (i.e., the World of Creation), with four legs and-six steps, thus making ten (i.e., the decade of Sepkirotk which each world has). . . . For this Throne and its service he formed the ten Angelic hosts (i.e., the World of Formation), Malackim, Arelim, Ohaioth, Ophanim, Okoskmalim, EUm, Elohim, Benei Elohim, Ishim, and Seraphim (O'~N O\"OlUn 0'')5nN l\",n O\"N'N O'~N'rJ c'm,lU C'lLt'N C'M~N '.:l:l O'M~N), and for their service, again, he made Samael and his legions (i.e., the World of Action), who are, as it were, the clouds upon which the angels ride in their descent on the earth, and serve, as it were, for their horses. Hence it is written-' Behold the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt.'\" (Isa. xix, 1.) (Sohar ii, 48 a.) There are, therefore, four worlds, each of which has a separate Sephiric system, consisting of a decade of emanations. I. The A.tzilatic World, called alternately the World of Emanations (n'~'~N C~'.11), the Image (N.3P'\" = WCWJI with , prefixed), and the Heavenly Man (C'N M1't~V), which, by virtue of its being a direct emanation from God and most intimately allied with the Deity, is perfect and immutable. II. The Briatic World. called tke World of fJreation (MN\".:1M O,'W) and the Throne (N'O·n~), which is the rmmediete eIl;lanation of the former, and whose ten Sephi'1'{)t~ being further removed from the En Soph, are . of. a j)l~·ijmited and oiroumscribed potency, though the eubstaaeea they oom~ris& are of the purest mature and without - \\"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"any admixture of matter. III. The Jetzi1'atic World, called tke World of Formation (m'~'iT C~,.v) and the World of Angels (N'=nt~O)i which proceeded from the former world, and whose ten Sepkiroth,. though of \"a still less refined substance than the former, because further removed from the primordial source, are still without matter. It is in this angelic world where those intelligent and uncorporeal beings reside, who are wrapped in a luminous garment, and who assume a sensuous form when they appear to man. And IV. The Assiatic World, called the World of Action (n'lV.vn C~,.v)· and the World of Matter (nlEl'~pn C~'.v) which emanated from the preceding world, the ten Sephiroth of which are made up of the grosser elements of all the former three worlds, aud which has sunk down in consequence of its materiality and heaviness. Its substances consist of matter limited by space and perceptible to the senses in a multiplicity of forms. It is subject to constant changes, generations, and corruptions, and is the abode of the Evil Spirit. Before leaving this doctrine about the creation and the relationship of the Supreme Being to the universe, we must reiterate two things. I. Though the trinity of the Sepkiroth gave birth to the universe, or, in other words, is an evolution . of the emanations, and is thus a further expansion of the Deity itself, it must not be supposed that the Kabbalists believe in a Trinity in our sense of the word. Their view on this subject will best be understood from the following remark in tke Sohm'-\" Whoso wishes to have an insight into the sacred unity, let him consider a flame rising from a burn- ing coal or a burning lamp. He will see first a. twofold light, a bright white and a black or blue light; the white light is above, and ascends in a direct light, whilst the blue or dark light is below, and seems as the chair of the former, yet both are so intimately conneoted together that they con- stitute only one flame. The seat, however, formed by. the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"26 blue or dark light, is again connected with the burning matter which is under it again. The white light never changes its colour, it always remains white; but various shades are observed in the lower light, whilst the lowest light, moreover, takes two directions-above it is connected with the white light, and below with the burning matter. Now this is constantly consuming itself, and perpetually ascends to the upper light, and thus everything merges into a single unity (,n ~\"n'.J iT!'i'I1~ ~\"~, Schar, i, 51 a).10 And II. The creation, or the universe, is simply the garment of God woven from the Deity's own substance; or, as Spinoza expresses it, God is the immanent basis of the universe. For although, to reveal himself to us, the Concealed of all the Concealed sent forth the ten emanations called the Form of God, Form of the H(!avenly Man, yet since even this luminous form was too dazzling for our vision, it had to assume another form, or had to put on another garment which consists of the universe. The universe, therefore, or the visible world, is a further expansion of the Divine Substance, and is called in the Kabbalah\" the Garment of God.\" Thus we are told, \" when the Concealed of all the Concealed wanted to reveal himself, he first made a point [i.e. the first Sephira], shaped it into a sacred form [i.e. the totality of the Sephiroth], and covered it with a rich and splendid garment that is the world.\" (Sollar, i, 2 a). III. The Creation of Angels and Men. The different worlds which successively emanated from the En Soph and from each other, and which sustain the relation- ship to the Deity of first, second, third, and fourth generations, are, with the exception of the first (i.e., the WorId of Ema- nations), inhabited by spiritual beings of various grades. 10 The question, however, about the doctrine of the Trinity in other passages of the Bobar will be discussed more amply in the sequel, where we shall point on the relation of the Kabbalah to Christianity. - \\"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"27 \"God animated every part of the firmament with a separate spirit, and forthwith all the heavenly hosts were before him. This is meant by the Psalmist, when he says (Ps. xxxiii, 6), C By the breath of his mouth were made all their hosts:\" (Bobar, iii, 68 a.) These angels consist of two kinds-good and bad; they have their respective princes, and occupy the three habitable worlds in the following order. As has already been remarked, the first world, or the Archetypal Man, in whose image everything is formed, is occupied by no one else. The angel METATRON (n'ZOZOO) occupies the second or the Briatic World (i1N~':J. C~'V), which is the first habitable world; he alone constitutes the world of pure spirits. He is the garment of ',rv i.e., the visible manifestation of the Deity; his name is numerically equivalent to that of the Lord. (Sohar, iii, 231 a.) He governs the visible world, preserves the unity, harmony, and the revolutions of all the spheres, planets and heavenly bodies, and is the Captain of the myriads of the an- gelic hosts\" who people the second habitable or the Jetziratic 11 The Kabbalistic description of Metatron. is taken from tbe Jewish angelology of It much older date than this theosophy.

He is called the Great 1':IIc1l1'r, the Teacher of Teachers (N~\"1 N\"1CO), ami it is for this reason that Enoch, who walked in close communion with God, and taught mankind by his holy example, .is said by the Chaldee paraphrase of Jonathan b.

It is true that he who obeys God ant of love has attained to the highest degree, and already belongs to the saints of the world to come, but' it must not be supposed that to worship God out of lear is no worship. Such a service has also its merit, though in this case the union of the soul with the Deity is slight. There is only one degree which is higher than fear: it is Iove, In love is the mystery of the divine unity. It is love which unites the higher and 'lower degrees together; it elevates everything to that position where everything must be one.

It is for this reason that the patriarchs are denomi- nated the Chariot-throne of the Lord. Following the paths of righteousness, the saints on earth enjoy the protection of heaven in an especial manner, by virtue of the divine wisdom inherent in them, for they are able to decipher the signs which God has put in the firmament, to shield them from accidents. \" In heaven above, that sur- rounds the universe, are signs in which the deepest mysteries are concealed. These signs are constellations and stars, which are studied and deciphered by the wise.\" (Sohar, ii, 76 a.) Hence the admonition-\" He who has to start on a journey very early, should rise at daybreak, look carefully towards the east, and he will perceive certain signs resembling letters which pierce through the sky and appear above the horizon. These shining forms are those of the letters wherewith God created heaven and earth.

N ow since it is an absolute condition of the soul to return to the Infinite Source from which it emanated, after developing all those perfections, the germs of which are eternally implanted in it; and since some souls do not at. once develope these fruits of righteousness, which precludes their immediate re- union with their Primordial Source, another term of life is vouchsafed to them, so that they may be able to' cultivate those virtues which they stifled in their former bodily life, and without which it is impossible for them to return to their heavenly home. Hence, if the soul, in its first assuming a human body and sojourn on earth, fails to acquire that ex- perience for which it descends from heaven. a~1(l becomes contaminated by that which is polluting, it must re-inhabit a body again and again till it is able to nscen.l in a purified state through repeated trials.

The transmigration of'the soul into another body, however, is restricted to three times;. and if two souls in their third residence in human bodies are still too weak to resist all earthly trammels and to acquire the neoossary experience, they are both united and sent into one body, so that they may be able conjointly to.Iearn.that which they were too feeble to do separately. It sometimes, however, happens that it is the singleness and isolation of the soul which is the source of her weaJmess,and she requires help to pass through her . probation. In that case she chooses for a companion a soul which has more strength and better fortune. The stronger of the two then becomes as it were the mother; she carries the- sickly one in her bosom, and nurses her from her own substfmce, just as a woman nurses her child. Such anastro- eiation is therefore called pregnancy (\":J'Y), because the stronger soul gives as it were life and substance to the weaker eompanion.\" 1'\"\" f\"'~'Ilro om fV!'

We have already seen that the Kabbalah claims a pre- Adamite existence, and asserts that its mysteries are covertly conveyed in the first fonr books of the Pentateuch. Those of ' us who read the Books of Moses, and cannot discover in them any of the above-mentioned doctrines, will naturally ask for the principles of exegesis whereby these secrets are de- duced from or rather introduced into the text. Theseprin- ciples are laid down in the following declaration :-\" If the Law simply consisted of ordinary expressions and narratives, e. gr., the words ofEsau, Hagar, Laban, the ass of Bslsam, . or of Balsam himself, why should it be called the Law of truth, the perfect Law, the true .. witness of God? Each word contains a sublime source, each narrative points not only to the single instance in. question, but also to generals.\" (Soltar, iii, 149 b.) \"Woe be to the son of man who says that the Tora (Pentateuch) contains common sa.yin\"g'''J H"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"46 .andordinary narratives.!/I; For, if this were the case, we might in the present day compose a code-ofdoctrines from profane writings which should excite greater respect.

Both the Synagogue and the Church have maintained the same from time immemorial. Thus the Talmud already describes the impious Manasseh, King of Israel, as making himself merry over the narratives of the Pentateuch and ironically asking (:lIll\"I' l\"I'11'Q:l11'jlm 1:1 molY.! nrrrr \"lon, \"lon 10'; ml\"l>l N'lN :I,m; moo; ,; l\"I'l\"I N'l ':1' ~ '0\" 'no n\"'n:l '11:\"\"\" mul:l C'N'\" ~\"C'llln ''Si' ~':l p.'N\"l 1\"\" )Il''lN; Illl'lo), whether Moses could not find anything better to relate than that\" Loton's. sister was Timna\" (Gen. xxxvi, 22); \"Timna was the concubine of Eliphaz \" (ibid, v, 12); that\" Reuben went in the days of the wheat harvest, and found mandrekesIn the field \"(ibid., xxx, 14), &c., &c.

As to the relation of the Kabbalah to. Caristianity, i,is maintained that this theosophy propounds the doctrine of the trinity and thesufferingaof Messiah. How far this is true may be ascertained from the following passages. 80 H We have already remarked in several places that the daily liturgical de- claration about the divine unity is that which is indicated in the Bible (Deut. vi, 43), where Jehovan occurs first, then Elonenu, and then again Jekovah, which three together constitute a unity, and for this reason he [i.e., Jehovah] is in the said place called one ('mN). But there are three names, and how can they be one? And although we read one (,nN), are they really one? Now this is revealed by the vision of the Holy Ghost, and when the eyes are closed we get to kno. that the three are only one. This is also the mystery of the voice. The voice is only one, and yet it consists of three. elements, fire [i.e., warmth], air [i.e., breath], and water [i.e., humidity]. yet are all these one in the mystery of the voice, and can only be one. Thus also Jehovah,. Elohenu, ann Jehovah constitute one-three forms which are one. And tbis is indicated by the voice which man raises [i.e., o.t prayer [, thereby 1.0 comprehend spiritually the most perfect unity of the En Sopk for the finite, since all the three [i.e., Jehovah, Elohenu, Jehovah] are read 'With the same loud voice, which comprises in itself a trinity.

On another occasion we are informed tha.t R.Eleazar, whilst f<litting 'with' his fo.ther,R.Simeon,wRs ttnxiousto ,know how the two names, Jekoilakand Eiokim, can be interchanged, seeing that the onadenotesmercyandthe other judgmellt.

The reason of this,lts it is generallysuppoBed, is k> avoid the repetition of Adonai, Adonai, since the .Tetragrammaton is otherwise always pointed and read (~~). The Kabbalah, however, as we shall see, discovers in it a recondite meaning. SI ,., R. Eleazar, when sitting before his father R. Simeon,ss.id to him, we have been taught that whenever EloMm (O,\"\"N) occurs, it denotes justice. Now how can Elokim sometimes be pur for Jehovah, as is the case in those passages wherein Adona; ('J\"N) and Jekoval. (mil') stand together (Oorap.: Gen .. xv, 8; Ezek. ii, 4, &c.), seeing that the latter denotes mercy in all the passages in which it occurs? To whioh he replied, Thus it is said in the Scripture, 'Know therefore this day snd consider it in thine heart, tbatJekovak' is EloMm' (Dent. iv, 19) ; and again it is written' Jehovah is Rlohim.' (Ibid., ver, 85.)

But before 'this is done, it will be necessary to summarize, as briefly as possible, those doetririe$whieh are peculiar to the Kabbalah, or which it expounds andelaboretes in an especial manner, and whioh constitute it· a separate system within the precincts of Judaism. The doctrines are as follow:- 1. God is boundless in his nature. He has neither will, intention,desire, thought, language, nor action .. He cannot be grasped and depicted; and, for this reason, is called En Soph, and as such he is in a certain sense not existent. 2. He, is not the direct creator of the universe, since he could nut will the creation; and since a creation proceeding directly from him would, have to be as boundless and as per- feetas he is himself. 3 .• He at first sent forth ten emanations, or Sephiroth, which are begotten, not made, and which are both infinite and finite. 4. From these Sephiroth, which are the Archetypal Man, the different worlds gradually and succeasively evolved; These evolutionary worlds are the brightness and the express image of their progenitors, the 8ephiroth, which uphold', all things. \""},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"64 5. These emanations, or Sepkirotn, gave rise to or created in their own image all human souls. These souls are pre- existent, they occupy a special hall in the upper world of spirits, and there already decide whether they will pursue a good or bad course in their temporary sojourn in the human body, which is also fashioned according to the Archetypal . image. 6.· No one has seen the Elf Sopk at any time. It is the . Sephirotk, in whom the En Soplt is incarnate, who have revealed themselves to us, and to whom the anthropomor- phisms of Scripture and the Hagada refer. Thus when it is said, \"God spake, descended upon earth, ascended into heaven, smelled. the sweet smell of ascrifioes, repented in his heart, was angry,\" &c., &c., or when the Hagadic works .describe the body and the mansions of the Deity, &c., all this does not refer to the En Sopk, but to these intermediate beings. 7. It is an absolute condition of the soul to return to the Infinite Source whence it emanated, after developing all those perfections the germs of which are indelibly inherent in it. If it fails to develope these germs, it must migrate into another body, and in case it is still too weak to acquire the virtues for which it is sent to this earth, it is united to another and a stronger soul, which, occupying the same human body with it, aids its weaker companion in obtaining the object for which it came down from the world of spirits. 8. When all the pre-existent souls shall have passed their probationary period here below, the restitution of all thingS\" will take place; Satan will be restored to an angel of light, hell will disappear, and all souls will return into the bosom of the Deity whence they emanated.

Their works are r. The Book of Creation; II. The Sohar ; and III. The Oommentary of the Ten Sepltiroth. As the Book of Creation is acknowledged by all parties to be the oldest, we shall examine it first. I. The Book of Oreation-ot: Jetzira. This marvellous and famous document pretends to be a monologue of the patriarch Abraham, and premises that the contemplations it contains are those which led the father of the Hebrews to abandon the worship of the stars and to embrace the faith of the true God. Hence the remark of the cele- brated philosopher, R. Jehudsh He-Levi (born about 1086)- \"The Book of the Creation, which belongs to our father Abraham, demonstrates the existence of the Deity and the Divine Unity, by things which are on the one hand manifold and multifarious, whilst on the other hand they converge and harmonize; and this harmony can only proceed from One who originated it.\"} (Kkozari, iv. 25.) The whole Treatise consists of six Perakim (t:l'p'EJ) or chap- ters, subdivided into thirty-three very brief Misknas (nl:llVb) or sections, as follows. The first chapter has twelve sections, the second has five, the third five, the fourth four, the fifth three, and the sixth four sections. The doctrines which it propounds are delivered in the style of aphorisms or theorems, and, pretending to be the dicta of Abraham, are laid down very dogmatically, in a manner becoming the authority of this patriarch. As has already been intimated, the design of this treatise is to exhibit a system whereby the universe may be viewed methodically in connection with the truths given in the Bible, 'T!m 0':l1I100'll;nno 0\"1:1.,:1 ,n,.,non ,nm;N ;:\\> rrnn •••• om:lN'l N1m mT 'WO 1 ,mm '\"1T1:1 : OnD O~\"Tl:J' ''lllN mNl'l ~r.l onO:lDm ,nN ~ O'l:l:lCJ O'mNnO Ol'l ;:IN nl/:I ':1\":1,"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"66 thus shewing, from the gradual and systematic development of tbecreation, and from the harmony which' pr~vails in aU' its multitudinous,oomponent parts, that One Godprodnced it all, and that He. is over all. The order in which God gave rise to thiscroatioD out of nothing (,mnOtOOb .,~~), and the harmony which pervades all the constituent parts of· the universe are shown by the analogy which subsists between the ~isible things and the signs of thought, or the means. whereby wisdom is expressed and perpetuated among men. Since the letters have no absolute value, nor can they be used as mere forms, but serve as the medium between essence and form, and like words, assume the relation of form to the real essence, and of essence to the embryo and unexpressed thought, great value is attached to these letters, and to the combinations and analogies of which they are capable. The patriarch Abraham, therefore, employs the double value of the twenty- two letters of the Hebrew alphabet r' he uses them, both in , their phonetic nature and in their sacred character, as ex- pressing the divine truths of the Scriptures. But, since the Hebrew alphabet is also used as numerals, which are repre- sented by the fundamental number ten, and since the vowels of the language are also ten in number, this decade is added to the twenty-two letters, and these two kinds of signs-i.e., the t.wenty-two .Ietters of the alphabet and the ten funda- mentalnumbers-e-are designated the tMrty-ewo u'ays of secret wisdom ;a,nd the treatise opens with the' declarationv->' By thirty-two paths of .seoret wisdom, the Eternal, the' Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, the living God, the King of the Universe; the Merciful and Gracious, the High and Exalted God, He who inhabiteth eternity, Glorious and Holy is His 2 It is for this reason that the Book Jetzira: is also called ')'~ ~lol' l'wn'llo! the Letters or'Atphabet of the Patriarch Abraham. 0;\" ·1'lr.l' C\"M c'mN 'll>l\"\\1ll' ~ n'llo!:m ;TiM' M' ppM MO:JM • n'lN\"lD C'nul'l c\"Gl'lm 8 \",,~.\"f;lC : \"'l:l'O, \"100'1 \"100:1 C\"'f;lC:1lll'1Il:n 'O\\l)1ll1'TP' c'''O''P,'lillol\\l))' m 1,JMl .0'\"\" 'IN 'lol. mll)O.'lol \"j1'1r"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"numbers, (Bepher -~ 67 name, hath created the world by means of (':10) (\":10) phonetic language, and writing (':10).\" Jetzira, chapter i ; Miskna i.) First of all· comes the fundamental number ten. This decade is divided into a tetrade and hexade, and thereby is shown the gradual development of the world out of nothing. At first there existed nothing except the Divine Substance, with the creative idea and the articulate creative word as the Spirit or the Holy Spirit, which is one with the Divine Sub- stance and indivisible. Hence, the Spirit of the living God (O~'n t:l'il~N mi) stands at the head of all things and is represented by the number one. \" One is the spirit of the living God, blessed be His name, who liveth for ever! voice, spirit, and word, this is the Holy Ghost.\" (Chapter i, Mislma IX). From this Spirit the whole universe proceeded in gradual and successive emanations, in the fallowing order. The creative air, represented by number two, emanated from the 81'il'it (rni::l n,,). \" In it He engraved the twenty-two letters.\" The water again, represented by the number three, proceeded from the ail\" (m,~ I:l'~). \"In it He engraved darkness and emptiness, slime and dung.\" Whilst the ether or fire, represented by the number four, emanated from the water (O'::l(;) '.v~). \"In it He engraved the throne of His glory, the Ophsnim, tho Seraphim, the sacred animals, end the ministering angels, and from these three he formed His habitauon ; as it is written-' He maketh the wind his messen- gers, flaming fire his servants'\" (Cap. i.

These constitute the three fundamental types of the universe (O\"J'.:1 J1'~N lU'tlt). The three primordial elements also thickened still more in another direction, and gave birth to a new order of creatures, which constitute the course of the year and the temperatures. From the ether developed itself heat, from the water emanated cold, and from the air proceeded the mild temperature which shows itself in the rain or wet. These constitute the fundamental points of the year (llhV mV.:ln'~N). Whereupon the three primordial elements developed themselves in another direction again, and gave rise to the human organism.

This is shown by the twelve simple consonants of the alphabet. Thus it is declared, that by means of the twelve letters, which are i'~:VO i~ ~tQn niT, God created the twelve signs of the Zodiac, viz. :- In the World-Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces.

In the Year-The twelve months, viz., Nisan, Jiar, Sivan, Tamus, Ab, Elul, Tishri, Cheshvan, Kislev, Tebet, Shebat, Adar. (Camp. chapter v, Miskna i.) The three dominions continued gradually to develope into that infinite variety of objects which is perceptible in each. This infinite variety, proceeding from the combination of a few, is propounded by means of the great diversity of combinations and permutations of which the whole alphabet is capable."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"These letters, small in number, being only twenty-two, by their power of combination and transposition, yield an endless number of words and figures, and thus become the types of all the varied phenomena in the creation,\" \"Just as the twenty-two letters yield two hundred and thirty-one types by. combining AlepJ~ (N) with all the letters, and all the letters with Aleph; Beth (.J), with all the letters, and all the letters with Beth, 80 all the formations and all that is spoken proceed from one name.\" (Chapter ii, Mishna, iv.) The table on the opposite page will shew how the two hundred and thirty-one types are obtained by the combination of the twenty-two letters. The infinite variety in creation is still more strikingly exhibited by permutations. of which the Hebrew alphabetis capable, and through which an infinite variety of types is obtained.

Thus the whole creation is one connected whole; it is like a pyramid pointed at the top, which was its beginning, and exceedingly broad in its basis, which is its fullest development in all its multitudinous component parts . . Throughout the whole are perceptible two opposites, with a reconciling medium. Thus, in the macrocosm, \" the ethereal fire is above, the water below, and the air is between these hostile elements to reconcile them.\" (Chapter vi, Miskna i.) . The same is the case in the heaven, earth and the atmosphere, as well as in the microcosm. But all the opposites in the COEf- mio, telluric and organic spheres, as well as in the moral world, are designed to balance each other. \" God has placed in all things one to oppose the other; good to oppose evil, good proceeding from good, and evil from evil; good purifies ~vil, and evil purifies good; good is in store for the good, and evil is reserved for the evil.\" (Chapter vi, Misknn. ii.) From this analysis of its contents it will be seen that the Book Jeteira, which the Kabbalists claim as their oldest document, has really nothing in COmmon with the cardinal doctrines of the Kabbalah. There is not a single word in it bearing on the En Sopk, the Archetypal Man, the specula- tions about the- being and nature of the Deity, and the Sepltiroth,· which constitute the essence of the Kabbalah. Even its treatment of the ten digits, as part of the thirty-two ways of wisdom whereby God created the universe, which has undoubtedly suggested to the authors of the Kabbalah the idea of the ten Sepbiroth, is quite different from the mode in which the Kabbalistic Sepkirotk are depicted,as may be seen from a most cursory comparison of the respective diagrams which \\lVe have given to illustrate the plans of the two systems."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":",Besides the langua.ge of tke Bo/JlcJett:ira and the train of id'(3as therein enunciated, es the erudite Zunz rightly remarke, .shew that tbis.treatise belongs to the Geonim period, i.e., about ,.the. ninth .oentury of the Christian era, when it first became know!l.l~ .

J'ochai's disciples, when ona journey, and passing through theviIlage where the.widowof R. -Hamnuna Saba resided, visited this venerable woman.

Jochai had died during the course of these Kab balisticreveletions, and that this portion of the Sohar contains the discourses which the Sacred Light delivered before his death to the small assembly of six pupils, who still survived and congregated to listen to the profound mysteries. It is to a great extent a recapitula- tion of the .Idr« R«bba,occupying itself with speculations about the Sepkirotil; theD_eity in his. three aspects (l'~\"J1~:C), or principles which successively developed themselves from each other, viz.:-the En Soph (COnO 'l'N), or the Boundless in his absolute nature, the M acroprosopon (l'E)JN1\"N) ,or the Boundless as manifested in the first emanation,and the Microprosopon (l'E).:JN \"J.'T), the other nine emanations; the abortive creations, &c\" and concludes with recording the death ofSimonb. J ochai, the Sacred Light and the medium-through whom God revealed the contents of the So/tar. The Idra Suta has. been translated into Latin 'by Rosenroth in the second volume of his Kabbala Denudata. ,From this brief analysis of its component parts and eon- tents; it will be seen that the Sol tar does not propound 11 . regular Kabbalistic system,but promiscuously and reiteratedly . dilates upon the diverse doctrines oftbis -theosophy.rae indi- cated in the forms and ornaments of the Hebrew alphabet, in the ',vowe1 points and accents, in the Divine names and the letters' of. which they are composed, in the narratives of the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"A4 Bible, and in the traditional and national stories. Hence the Schar is more a collection of homilies or rhapsodies on Kabbalistic subjects than treatises on the Kabbalah. It is for this very reason that it became the treasury of the Kab- balah to the followers of this theosophy. Its diversity became its charm. The long conversations between its reputed author, R. Simon b. Jochai, and Moses, the great lawgiver and true shepherd, which it records; the short and pathetic . prayers inserted therein; the religious anecdotes; the attrao- . tive spiritual explanations of scripture passages, appealing to the hearts and wants of.men; the description of the Deity and of the SephirotJt under tender forms of human relationships, comprehensible to the finite mind, such as father, mother, primeval man, matron, bride, white head, the great and small face, the luminous mirror, the higher heaven, the higher earth, &c., which it gives on every page, made the Sokar a welcome text-book for the students of the Kabbalah,who, by its vivid descriptions of divine love, could lose themselves in rapturous embraces with the Deity. Now, the SoJtar pretends to he a revelation from God, com- municated through R. Simon b. Joohai, who flourished about A.D. 70-110, to his select disciples. We are told that\" when they assembled to compose the Sohar, permission was granted to the prophet Elias, to all the members of the celestial college, to all angels, spirits, and superior souls, to assist them; and the ten spiritual substances [i.e., SepMrotJt] were charged to disclose to them their profound' mysteries, which were reserved for the days of the Messiah.\" On the approach of death, R. Simon b.Jochai assembled the small number of his disciples and friends, amongst whom was his son, R. Eleazar, to communicate to them his last doctrines,\" \"when *' ,,\\m, : ':'1\":1~:1l'1'1llM\"1' IT''''\\:1M ,,\\lIU?' ~'\" '''\\:1 \"\\~lt ':1\"\\' :1,n:l' It:llt ':1\"\\ ':l~ lt~\"\\'1Clt 'P' 1 9 , \"':1,'i11'f!\""},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"85 he ordered as follows-B. Aba shall write, R. Eleazar, my son, propound, and let my other associates quietly think about it.\" (ldora Suta, Sonar, iii, 287 b.) It is upon the strength of these declarations, as well as upon the repeated representation of R. Simon b. J ochai - as speaking and teaching throughout this production, that the Sohar is ascribed to this Rabbi on its very title-page, and - that not only J-ews, for centuries, but such distinguished Christian scholars as Lightfoot, Gill, Bartolocci, Pfeifer, Knorr von Bosenroth, Molitor, &c., have maintained this opinion. A careful examination, however, of the following internal and external evidence will show that this Thesaurus of the Kabbalah is the production of the thirteenth century. 1. The Sohar most fulsomely praises its own author, calls him the Sacred Light (~rv'''i' ~'J::t'.:l), and exalts him above Moses, \"the true Shepherd.\"20 \"I testify by the sacred heavens and the sacred earth,\" declares R. Simon b. J oehai, \"that I now see what no son of man has seen since Moses ascended the second time on Mount Sinai, for I see my face shining as brilliantly as the light of the sun when it descends as a healing for the world; as it is written, ' to vyou who fear my name shall shine the Sun of Righteousness with a healing in his wings: (Malachi, [iii, 20] iv, 2.) Yea, more, I know that my face is shining, but Moses did not know it nor understand it; for it is written (Exud. xxxiv, 29), 'Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone:\" (Soha?', iii, 132 b; 144 a.) The disciples deify R. Simon in the Sobar, declaring that the verse, \"all thy males shall appear before the Lord God\" (Exod. xxiii, 17), refers to R. Simon b.

Royal Diadem, is a beautiful and pathetic composition, embodying the cosmic views of Aristotle, and formspartof the Jewish service for the evening preceding the Great Day of Atonement to the present day.

The Sohar records events which transpired A.D. 1264. Thus on Numb. xxiv, 17, which the Sohar explains as referring to the time preceding the advent of Messiah, it remarks,\" \"the Holy One, blessed be he, is prepared to rebuild Jerusalem. Previous to the rebuilding thereof he will cause to appear, a wonderful and splendid star; which will shine seventy days. It will first. be seen on Friday, Elul = July 25th, and disappear on Saturday or Friday evening at the end of seventy days.

That Moses de Leon should have palmed the Sokar upon Simon b. Jochai was nothing remarkable, since this Rabbi is regarded by tradition as the embodiment of mysticism. No better hero could be selected for the Sohal' than R. Simon, of whom the Talmud gives us the following account: \"Once upon a time, R. Jehudah, R. Jose, and R. Simon sat together, and R. Jehudah b. Gerim sat by them. R. Jehudah then began and said-How beautiful are the works of this nation (i.e., the Romans)! they have erected market-places, they have erected b~idges, and they have erected baths! R.. Jose was quiet, but R. Simon b. Joohai answered and said: what they have built they have built for no one except for their own use, they made markets to allure prostitutes, they made baths to gratify themselves therein, and bridges to get. tolls by them. Jehudah b. Gerim repeated this, and the emperor's government got to hear it, who. passed the following decree: Jehudah, who exalted, is to be exalted; Jose, who was silent, is to be banished to Zipporis; and Simon, who spoke evil, is to be killed. He (i.e., R.Simon) at once concealed himself with his son, in the place of study, whither his wife daily brought them a loaf and a flask of water; but as the rigour of the decree increased, he said to his son: women are weak- .. minded-if she is tortured sbemay betray us.

A.D. 12(0), frankly declares that\" the doctrine of the En Sopkand the ten Sephirotl, is neither to be found in the Law, Prophets, or Hagiographa, nor in the writings of the Babbins of blessed memory, but rests solely upon signs which . are scarcely perceptible.Y It has indeed been supposed that covert allusions to the Sepkiroth. are to be found in the Talmud. If this could be proved, the date of the Kabbalah would have to be altered from the twelfth to the second or third century after Ch~ist. An . examination, however, of the passage in question, upon which this opinion is based, will show how thoroughly fanciful it is. The passage is as follows-\" The Babbins propound, At first the name of twelve letters was communicated to every one, but when the profane multiplied, it wasoulycommunicated to the most pious of the priests; and these pre-eminently pious priests absorbed it from their fellow priests in the chant. It is recorded that R Tarphon said, lance went up the orchestra in the Temple after my maternal uncle, and, bending forward my ear to a priest, I heard how he absorbed it from his fellow priests,in the chant. R Jehudah said in the name of Rab, the divine name of forty-two letters is only communicated to such as are pious, not easily provoked, not given to drinking, andare.not self opinionated.

Any doubt upon this subject must be relinquished when the two systems are com- pared.

Azariel, whose work, as we have seen, is the first Kabbalistic production, candidly tells us that in viewing the Deity AS purely negative, and divesting him of all attributes, he followed the opinion of the philosophers.r? When R. Azariel moreover tells us that \" the En Soph. can neither be comprehended by the intellect, nor described in words; for there is no I etter or word which can grasp him,\" we have here almost the very words of Proclus, who tells us that, \"although he is generally called the unity (ro ~v) or the first, it would be better if no name were given him; for there is no word which can depict his nature-he is (apPTJro!;, ayvwUTO!;), the inexpressible, the unknown.\" (Theo/.

The great land mark in the development. of the Kab- balah is the birth of the Bokar, which divides the' history of this theosophy into two periods, viz., the pre-Sohar period and the post-Sonar period.

He requested N achmanides to visit him on the Sabbath, being the day fixed for his exe- cution; and when Nachmanides reproved him for his sins, the Kabbalist declared that he was innocent, and that he would appear at his house on this very day, after tbe execution, and pa.rtake with him the Sabbath meal. He proved true to his promise, as by means of the Kabbalistic mysteries he effected that, and an aSS was executed in his stead, and he .himself was suddenly transposed into Machmanides' house.

Abstract numbers or Ii priori maxims; III, The generally acknowledged maxims, or consensus communis; 8 This will be seen from the reduction of the respective names to their numerical fl.1ue hy the rule Gematria, viz. :-; 30 + H 1 + '10 + 1 7 .. :.00 = 248 ; , 6 + ~ I) + • 10 + .. 200 + ~ 30 + 1 7 = 248 ; and c 40 +l\"I 0 + .. 200 + :l 2 + N 1 =;=248."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"'11 f) and IV, Transmitted doctrines or traditional maxims. The Kabbalistic tradition, which:goes back to Moses, is divisible into two parts, the first of which IS superior to the second in value, but subordinate to it in the order of study. The first part is occupied with the knowledge of the Deity, obtained by . means of the doctrine of the Sephiroth, as propounded in the Book Jetzira. The followers of this part are related to those philosophers who strive to know God from his works, and the Deity stands before them objectively as a light beaming into their understanding. These, moreover, give to the Sephiroth. sundry names to serve as signs for recognition; and some of this class differ but little from Christians, inasmuch as they substitute a decade for the triad, which they identify with God, and which' they learned in the school of Isaac the Blind. The second and more important part strives to know God by means of the twenty-two letters 'of the alphabet, from which, together with the vowel points and accents, those sundry divine names are combined, which elevate the Kabbalists to the degree of prophecy, drawing out their spirit, and causing it to be united with God and to become one with the Deity. This is gradually effected in the following manner. The ten Sepbirotb sublimate gradually to the upper Sepbira, called tkou.qltt, crown, or primordial air, which is -the root of all the other Sephiroth, and. reposes in the creative En Soph, In the same manner all the numerals are to be traced back to ' one, and all the trees, together with their roots and branches, are converted into their original earth as soon as they are thrown into the fire. To the ten Sephiroth, consisting of upper, middle and lower, correspond the letters of the alpha- bet, which are divided into three rows of ten letters each, the final letters inclusive, beginning and ending with Aleph; as well as the human body, with its head, the two arms, Ioius.i.testicles, liver, heart, brain, all of which unite into a higher unity and become one in the active voiil:. which in its"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"H6 ttml again unites itself with God.,.as the unity to whioh ev~ry­ thing must return. The ten Sephiroth are after a higher conception, to be traced to a higher triad, which correspond to the letters Aleph, Betll, Gimmel, and the three principles combined in man, the vital in the heart, the vegetable in the liver, and the pleasurable in the brain, and also form themselves in a higher unity. It is in this way that the Kabbalist who is initiated into the. prophetic Kabbalah may gradually concentrate all his powers directto one point to God, and unite himself with the Deity, for whioh purpose the ideas developed in unbroken sequence, from the permutations of numbers and letters, will serve him as stepe upon which to ascend to God.\"?

It is in the form ofa dialogue between an Epicurean philosopher named Sidonius, a Jew named Baruch, and the author, who is introduced by his Greek name Capnio, and consists of three books, scccrd- ing to the number of speakers. Book I, the exponent of which is Baruch the Jewish Kabbalist,is occupied with a refutation of the Epicurean doctrines, and simply reproduces the arguments generally urged against this system, for which reason we omit my further desoription of it. Book II endeavours to shew that all wisdom and true • philosophy are derived from the Hebrews, that Plato, Pytha- goras and Zoroaster borrowed their ideas from the Bible, and that traces of the Hebrew language are to be found in the liturgies and sacred books of all nations. Then follows an explanation of the four divine names, which are shown tobave been transplanted into the systems of Greek philosophy.

The third name of God used in Holy Writ is TUN FIRE. In this form God appeared in the burning bush When he first manifested himself to Moses. The prophets describe him as a burning fire, and John the Baptist depicts him as such when he says, \"I baptize you with water, but he who cometh after me shall baptize you with fire.\" (Matt. iii, 11.) The fire of the Hebrew prophets is the same as the ether (al$~p) mentioned in the hymns of Orpheus. But these three names are in reality only one, showing to us the divine nature in three differeut aspects. Thus God calls himself th« Being, because every existence emanates from hiro; he calls himself Fire, because it is he who illuminates and animates all things and he is always HE, because he always remains like himself amidst the infinite variety of his works. Now just as there are names which express tbe nature of the Deity, so there are nameswbich refer to his attributes, and tbese are the ten Seplti1·otk. If we look away from every attribute and every definite point of view in which the divine subsistence may be contemplated, if we endeavour to depict the absolute Being as concentrating himself within himself, and not affording us any explicable relation to our intellect, he is then described by a name which it is forbidden to pronounce, by the thrice boly Tetragrammaton, the name Jehovah (mi'f') the Shem Ha-Meplwra8/~ (UmlOi'f CV). There is no .doubt that the tetrad (TETpamr;) of Pythagoras is an imitation of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton, and that the worship of the decade has simply been invented in honour of the ten SepMrotk. The four letters composing this name represent the four fundamental constituents of the body (i.e., beat, cold, dryness and humidity), the four geometrical prin- cipalpoints (i.e., the point, the line, fiat and body), the four aotes of'. the musical scale, .thefour rivers in the earthly"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"128 paradise, the four symbolical figuref\\in the vision of Ezekiel, &.0., &c., &c.

The number.fit·e, expressed by n the second letter, shows us the union of God with nature-of God inasmuch as he is depicted by the number three, i.e., the Trinity; and of visible nature, inasmuch as it is represented by Plato and Pythagoras under the dual. The number six, expressed by', the third letter, which is likewise revered in the Pythagorean school, is formed by the combination of one, two, and three, thesyrnbol of all perfection. Moreover the number si:c is the symbol of the cube, the bodies (solida), or the world. Hence it is evident that the world has in it the imprint of divine perfection. The fourth and last letter of this divine name (n) is like the second, represents the numberfive, and here symbolizes the human and rational soul, which is the medium between heaven' and earth, just as five is the centre of the decade, the symbolic expression of the totality of things. Book III, the exponent of which is Capnio, endeavours to shew that the most essential doctrines of Christianity are to be found by the same method. Let a few instances of this method suffice. Thus the doctrine of the Trinity is to be fouad in the first verse of Genesis. If the Hebrew word N~ which istranslate~ created, be examined, and if each of the three letters composing this word .baesken as the initial of a 8epa~ate word, we obtain the e~pressions.:ntm, lJ 8011, Spirit, Father.

The design of the Kabbalah is to propound the relations of the absolute Creator to the creature. God is the Creator of all beings which emanated from him, and he implanted aspirations in them to attain actual communion with him. In order that feeble man might attain this communion, God revealed himself to mankind in various ways, but especially to Moses. This Divine revelation to Moses contains far more than appears on the surface of the Pentateuch. There is a recondite wisdom concealed in it which distinguishes it from other codes of morals and precepts. There are in the Pentateuch many pleonasms and repetitions of the same things and words, and as we cannot charge God with having inserted useless and superfluous words in the Holy Scriptures, we must believe that something more profound is contained in them, to which the Kabbalah gives the key. This key consists in permutations, commutations, &c., &c. But this act of exchanging and arranging letters, and of in- terpreting for the edification of the soul the Holy Scriptures, which we have received from God as a divine thing not to be understood by the multitude, was not communicated by Moses to everybody, but to the elect, such as Joshua, and so by tradition it came to the seven ty interpreters. This gift is called Kabbalah. God, out of love to his people,has revealed hidden mysteries to some of them, and. these have found the living spirit in the dead letter; that is to say, the Scriptures consist of separate letters, visible signs which stand in a certain relation to the angels as celestial and spiritual emana- tions from God; and by pronouncing them, the latter also are affected.

The Treatises were regarded as heavenly communi- cations, revealing new divine wisdom. Conrad Leontarius, writing to Wimpheling on the subject, says-\" I never saw anything more beautiful or admirable than this work (i.e., De Verba Mirijico), which easily convinces him who reads it that no philosopher, whether Jew or Christian, is superior to Beuohlin.' Aegidius, general of the Eremites, wrote to the holy Augustine\" that Reuchlin had rendered him, as well as the rest of mankind, happy by his works, which had made known to all a thing hitherto unheard of.\" Philip Beroaldus, the younger, sent him word \"that Pope Leo X had read his Pythagorean book greedily, as he did all good books; after- wards the Cardinal de Medici had done so, and he himself should soon enjoy it.\"26 Such was the interest which this newly-revealed Kabbalah created among Christians, that not only learned men but statesmen and warriors began to study . the oriental languages, in order to be able to fathom the mysteries of this theosophy. 1450-1498. Whilst the Kabbalah was gaining such high favour amongst Christians both in Italy and Germany, through the exertions of Mirandola and Reuchlin, a powerful voice was raised among the Jews against the Sonar, the very Bible of this theosophy.

He therefore removed to the banks of the Nile, where he lived in a sequestered cottage for several years, givin~ himself up entirely to meditations and reveries. Here he had constant interviews with the prophet Elias, who communicated to him sublime doctrines. Here, too, his soul ascended to heaven whenever he was asleep, and in the celestial regions held converse with the souls of the great teachers of bygone days. When thirty-six. years of age (1570) the Prophet Elias appeared to him again and told him to go to Palestine, where his successor was awaiting him.

In this Treatise-which Leo de Modena composed in 1639, at the advanced age of sixty-eight, to reclaim Joseph Chamiz, a beloved disciple of his, who was an ardent follower of the Kabbalah-he shows that the books which propound this esoteric doctrine, and which are palmed upon ancient authorities, are pseudonymous; that the doc- trines themselves are mischievous; and that the followers of this system are inflated with proud notions, pretending to know the nature of Ged better than anyone else, and to possess the nearest and best way of approaching the Deity}! 1623.

Serach for his views of the Kabbalah, del Mcdigo, in 11 masterly letter, written in 1623, shows up the folly of this esoteric doctrine, and the unreasonableness of' the exegetical rules, whereby the followers of this system pretend to deduce it, from the Bible. 35 ltf3,35.

Just at the very time when some of· the most distinguished Jews exposed the pretensions of the Kabbalah, and denounced the fanciful and unjustifiable rules ef inter- pretation whereby its advocates tried to evolve it from the letters of the revealed law, the celebrated Athanasius Kircher, in a most learned and elaborate treatise on this subject, maintained that the Kabbalah was introduced into Egypt by no less a person than the patriarch Abraham; and that from Egypt it gradually issued all over the East, and intermixed with all religions and systems of philosophy. What is still more extraordinary is that this learned Jesuit, in thus exalting the Kabbalah, lays the greatest stress on that part of it which developed itself afterwards, viz., the combinations, transposi- tions and permutations of the letters, and does not discriminate between it and the speculations about the En Soph, the Bephiroth, &c., which were the original characteristics of this theosopby.\" The amount of Eastern lore, however, which Kircher has amassed in his work will always remain a noble monument to the extensive learning of this Jesuit. 1645-1676.

The famous Kabbalist, Sabbatai Zevi, who was born in Smyrna, July, 1641, was the chief actor in this tragedy. When a child he was sent to a Rahbinic school, and instructed in the Law, the Mishna, the Talmud, the Midrashim, and the whole cycle of Rabbinic lore. So great were his intellectual powers, and so vast the knowledge he acquired, that when fifteen he betook himself to the study of the Kabbalah, rapidly mastered its mysteries, became peerless in his knowledge of \" those things which were revealed and those things which were hidden;\" ~nd at the age of eighteen obtained the honourable appellation sage (l:J:Jn), and delivered public lectures, expounding the divine law and the esoteric doctrine before crowded audiences. At the age of twenty-four he gave himself out as the Messiah, the Son of David, aud the Redeemer of Israel, prououncing publicly the Tetragrammatou, which 'was only allowed to the high priests during the existence of the second Temple. Though the Jewish sages of Smyrna excommunicated him for it, he travelled to Salonica, Athens, Morea and Jerusalem, teaching the Kabbalah, proclaiming himself as the Messiah, anointing prophets and converting thousands upon thousands. So numerous were the believers in him, that in many places trade was entirely stopped; the Jews wound up their affairs, disposed of their chattels and made themselves ready to be redeemed from their captivity and led by Sabbatai Zevi hack . to Jerusalem. The consuls of Europe were ordered to enquire into this extraordinary movement, and the governors of the East reported to the Sultan the cessation of commerce. Sabbatai Zevi was then arrested by order of the Sultan, Mohammed IV, and taken before him at Adrianople. The Sultan spoke to him as. follows-\" I am going to test thy Messiahship. Three poisoned arrows shall be shot into thee, and if they do Dot kill thee, I too will believe that thou art the"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"140 Messiah:' He saved himself by embracing Islamism in the presence of the Sultan, who gave him the name E.lfendi, and appointed him Kapidgi Basbi. Thus ended the career of the Kabbalist Sabbatai Zevi, after having ruined thousands upon thousands of Jewish families. 38 1677-1 G84. Whether the learned Knorr Baron von Rosen- roth knew of the extravagances of Sabbatai Zevi or not is difficult to say. At all events ithis accomplished Ohristian scholar believed that Simon b. Joehaiwas the author of the Bobar, that he wrote it under divine inspiration, and that it is most essential to the elucidation of the doctrines of Christi- anity. \"yith this conviction he determined to master the ditfioulties connected with the Kabbalistio writings, in order to render the principal works of this esoteric doctrine accessible to his Christian brethren. For, although Lully, Mirandols, Reuchlin and Kircher had already donemuch to acquaint the Christian world with the secrets of the Kabbalah, none of these soholars had given translations of any portions of the Sokor. Knorr Baron von Rosenroth, therefore put himself under the tuition of R. Meier Stern, a learned Jew, and with his assistance was enabled to publish the celebrated work entitled the U1l1Jeiletl Kabbalah.

The only drawback to this gigantic work is that it is without any system, and that it mixes up in one all the earlier developments of the Kab- balah with the later productions. Still the criticism passed upon it by Buddeus, that it is a \" confused and obscure work, in which the necessary and the unnecessary, the useful and the useless are mixed. up and thrown together as it were into one chaos,\"39 is rather too severe; and it must be remembered that if the Kabbala Denudata does not exhibit a regular system of this esoteric doctrine, it furnishes much material for it. Baron von Rosenroth has also collected all the passages of the New Testament which contain similar doc- trines to those propounded by the Kabbalah. 1758-1763.

Zevi of Emden, or Jabez (y\",)l\"), as he is called from the acrostic of his riame (~,)~ j,) :1i'Y'), maintains in his work, which he wrote in 1758-1763, and which he entitled The Wrapper of Books, that with the exception of the kernel of the Sohar all the rest is of a late origin.t\" He shows that (1) The Soha» misquotes passages of Scripture, misunderstands the Talmud, and contains some rituals which were ordained by later Rabbinic authorities (C'i'O'El).

As the Kabbalah has played so important a part in the mental and religious development, and in the history of the Jewish people, the modern historians of the Jews, in depicting the vicissitudes of the nation, felt it to be an essential element of their narrative, to trace the rise and progress of this. esoteric doctrine.

No one, however, has prosecuted with more tho- roughness, learning and impartiality the doctrines, origin and development of this esoteric system than the historian Dr. Graetz. He, more than any of his predecessors since the publication of Landauer's literary remains, has in a most masterly manner carried out the principle laid down by this deceased scholar, and has distinguished between mysticism and the Kabbalah.

Though the Rabbi laboured hard to shake Dr. Graetz's position, yet, with the exception perhaps of showing that the Kabbalah was not invented in opposition to Maimonides' system of philosophy, the learned historian's results remain unassailed. Moreover, there is a confusion of mysticism with the Kabbalah through many parts of Dr. Low's eri tique. 58 We are not aware that anything has appeared upon this subject since the publication of Graetz's researches on the Kabbalah and Low's lengthy critique on these researohes.

This much, however, we may confidently·. say, that nothing has been omitted which essentially bears upon the real progress or development of this esoteric doctrine. Several works, in which lengthy accounts of the Kabbalah are given, have been omitted, because these descriptions do not contribute anything very striking in their treatment of the Kabbalah, nor have they been the occasion of any re- markable incidents among the followers of this system.
