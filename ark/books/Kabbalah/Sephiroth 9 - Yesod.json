It is also the beginning and the end as symbolized by the number 9. The beginning of a spiritual journey and the end of your material ties. It is the first state of energy we ri se to from our earthly existence in Malkuth . Taking the path of The Fool, we blindly step out into the unknown with no logical and material reason other than faith. In Yesod we have the energy of emotions, the power of the Moon and way to salvation through Tiphareth . We see the greatest part of The Tree of Life , Kether , from this first attainable step in the Sephiroths. Kether can be seen reflected in Tiphareth from Yesod . So we glimpse the wonderful destination of our travels up The Tree of Life even at this firs t stage of growth. From here at Yesod we must zig zag up The Tree of Life in the pattern called Nechushtan, the lightning flash.

So that is why there is no apparent path. Actually there is a way via Daath , the hidden Sephiroth. But it is said that to take this path will result in madness as the early Qabalaistic magicians found out. Whether this madness was their bliss at having found Binah whilst still in human form cannot be said, but they certainly lost all use for this world by taking this way.
