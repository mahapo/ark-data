Amen.\" Do not work too hard with the visualisations and se nsualisations.in the beginning. Keep the illustrati ons by you as a reminder, and let them grow in your mind with pract ice. If you are having diffulcties with sensualisat ion, put this advanced exercise aside and return to your regular practice of the Breathing the Aethers exercise, unt il you can sensualise readily. When pronouncing Sefirah names, the accent is on th e syllables in capitals; the sound dh is voiced th, as in this. This is a very powerful magical exercise and should not be done too often in the beginning. An excelle nt regular routine is to do it on the day of the New or Full M oon. If you are learning or doing it in a group, al l should face East, rather than standing in a circle. The Tree of Life exercise is the fullness of which a well-known G.D. technique, the Middle Pillar exercise, is a fragment. In its more advanced versions, certain Angel and God-Names are also pronounced and visualised within each Sphere. Copyright Society of Guardians, 1982. "}]
