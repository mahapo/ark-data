Every beginning is difficult. One must work hard to sow in order to be able to reap. It gives aptitude for resolving problems. It confers power both to awaken and to dominate the passions in the Physical world. It tends towards the organisation of natural elements and the dominion of forces in movement. It gives the aptitude to acquire, order, to model, to apply. Arcanum 1 is Unity, the Principle of Light, the Father, the world as manifestation, man as a livin g unity complete in himself, the foundation of reason, of all actions, the synthesis of all, the Initiation in the Mysteries and the power to decipher them and make use of them, volitive power. Arcanum 1 gives Triumph, but with a struggle due to karma. K abalistic Sephiroth: “Kether”. Hebraic Letter: “Aleph.” Transcendent Axiom (An axiom is an established or accepted principle or a self evident truth) : “Be in your deeds as you are in your thoughts.” Element of Prediction: “Promises dominion of mater ial obstacles, new social relationships, happy initiatives, the confluence of faithful friends who help in the development of projects, and jealous friends who obstruct them. Arcanum Number 2 By means of this Arcanum the Matrix is made, is modelled, whe re images take form. Arcanum 2 is the Thesis expounding the Antithesis. It is the Fount which accumulates the waters of the Spring. It is the dual manifestation of the Unity. Upon dividing, the Unity gives origin to receptive, productive femininity in all nature. Kabalistic Sephiroth: “Chochmah.” Hebraic Letter: “Beth” Transcendent Axiom: “The wind and the waves always favour the one who knows how to navigate.” Element of Prediction: “Attractions and repulsions, losses and gains, ascents and des cents. Inspiration favourable to initiative and the secret opposition of agents so as to lead that which has been begun to a favourable end.”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 Arcanum Number 3 It is said that Arcanum number 3 is the Modeller, this is clearly by means of the Verb; in al l creation, in all nature it models everything. Arcanum number 3 signifies Success, is material as well as spiritual production. Kabalistic Sephiroth: “Binah” Hebraic Letter: “Gimel.” Transcendent Axiom: “Your loom is weaving; cloth for your use and cloths which you need not use.” Element of Prediction: “Increase of material goods, prosperity in dealings, abundance, wealth, success. Obstacles to overcome, and satisfaction to the extent that they are overcome.” Arcanum Number 4 The four concorda nces exist in Arcanum number 4. These are: Affirmation, Negation, Discussion, Seduction.

Arcanum Number 5 Arcanum number 5 is Indication, Demonstration, Teaching, Karmic Law, Philosophy, Science, Art. It is Law, Rigor. Kabalistic Sephiroth: “Geburah”. Hebraic Letter: “He”."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 Transcendent Axiom: “I have heard of you by ear, but my e yes now see you and my heart now feels you.” Element of Prediction: “Liberty and restrictions, new experiences, acquisition of useful teachings, loves and affairs, voyages of ill - fated outcome. Propitious friends and friends of ill omen. Beings and thi ngs which come and go; those who come in order to leave, and those who leave in order to return.” Arcanum Number 6 Arcanum number 6 is the Lover, enchainment, equilibrium, terrible struggle between Love and Desire. The loving union between man and woma n, linking. It is the supreme affirmation of the Internal Christ and the supreme negation of the demon. One finds in Arcanum number 6 that one must choose this or that Path. The struggle between the two ternaries is in Arcanum number 6. The Mysteries o f the Lingam - Yoni. Kabalistic Sephiroth: “Tiphereth.” Hebraic Letter: “Vau.” Transcendent Axiom: Lord, you give me works, but with them, strength.” Element of Prediction: “Privileges and duties in the relations between the sexes. The antagonism of forces. Separations and divorces. Possession of that which is sought and ardent desires which are fulfilled; some which satisfy and others, which disappoint.” Arcanum Number 7 Arcanum number 7 is Struggle, Battle, Difficulties. The Warrior must lea rn to use the Staff and the Sword; thus he will attain great victory. Our motto is Thelema (Will). Kabalistic Sephiroth: “Netzach.” Hebraic Letter: “Zain.” Transcendent Axiom: “When science enters your heart and your Soul has been sweetened by wisdo m, ask and it will be given you.” "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 Element of Prediction: “Promises magnetic power, appropriate intellection (the union of the intellect and the intuition), justice and reparation, honour and dishonour, to achieve that which one pursues with determination , satisfactions and setbacks.” Arcanum Number 8 Arcanum number 8 signifies hard tests; it is Rectitude, Justice, and Equilibrium. One must seek the good, cost what it may, just as the Masters of Medicine, when they treat an ill person who is dying. T hey try to save them because that is the Law; they fulfil Doing Good. Within Arcanum number 8 are to be found Initiatic tests. Kabalistic Sephiroth: “Hod”. Hebraic Letter: “Cheth.” Transcendent Axiom: “Build an altar in your heart, but do not make o f your heart an altar.” Element of Prediction: “Promises retributions, punishment and compensation, gratitude and ingratitude. Compensation for services rendered.” Arcanum Number 9 Arcanum number 9 is the Hermit, prudent and wise; it is Solitude. I n the Ninth Sphere there is great suffering. Supreme Pain exists in the Ninth Sphere, as Dante said in “The Divine Comedy”. One must learn to understand, one must learn to suffer, to be resigned. Those who do not, fail. Kabalistic Sephiroth: “Jesod.” Hebraic Letter: “Teth.” Transcendent Axiom: “Ascend the mountain and contemplate the promised land, but I do not say that you will go thither.” Element of Prediction: “Promises science so as to make discoveries; order upon realising them, and cautio n to make use of them. Favourable associations and ill - fated"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 associations. Friends who help, and friends who obstruct. Light or reason and light of intuition; the first for that which is imminent, and the second for that which must be.” Arcanum Numbe r 10 From the esoteric point of view, Arcanum number 10 is really transcendental. The circle with a dot in the centre is a totally phallic symbol; the point elongated, becomes a line – the Lingam. If we place the line to the left, it forms the number 10 ; in this number are to be found all of the secrets of the Lingam - Yoni; the laws of irradiation and absorption. It is not possible to attain Intimate Self - Realisation without having worked in the Sahaja Maithuna. Arcanum number 10 is the Wheel of Samsara , the Cosmogenic Wheel of Ezekiel. In that wheel we find the battle of the antithesis. In that wheel is contained the complete secret of the Tree of Knowledge. Arcanum number 10 is the Wheel of the Centuries; is the tragic wheel, which is the Law of A ncient Return. It is logical that this law is intimately linked with the Law of Recurrence – that is to say, that everything comes to pass just as it has happened before, with the addition of the good and bad consequences. Dramas repeat - this is called Karma. Kabalistic Sephiroth: “Malchuth”. Hebraic Letter: “Iod.” When we ask for something, many times the Angels respond by showing us a clock. The disciple must take note of the time on the clock; that is the clock of destiny. The answer is to be found in the hour. The answer is always given to one in the esoteric allegory of the clock. One must learn to understand the clock. Hour: The First Hour of Apollonius. “Transcendental study of occultism.” Transcendent Axiom: “Costly is the knowledge which you buy with experience, and more costly that which you still need to buy.” Element of Prediction: “Promises good and bad fortune, ascents and descents, legitimate possessions, and dubious possessions. Recommendations of past contingencies and ci rcumstances which repeat in a different form.” Arcanum Number 11 "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 Arcanum number 11 is the work with the Fire, with the Force of Love. Persuasion is in essence, a subtle, spiritual force. Occult wisdom says: “Arouse the flame of the spirit with the f orce of Love.” Persuasion has more power than violence. Hebraic Letter: “Kaph.” Hour: The Second Hour of Apollonius. Transcendent Axiom: “Content in hope, long - suffering in tribulation, be constant in prayer.” Element of Prediction: “Promises cont rol over the direction which one follows, the dominion of the elements, vitality, rejuvenation, the gaining and loss of friends because of family matters. Sorrows, obstacles, jealousy, betrayals, resignation to withstand setbacks.” Arcanum Number 12 A rcanum number 12 implies sacrifices, sufferings; it is the card of the Apostolate. Arcanum number 12 brings much suffering, many struggles. It has a very nice synthesis because 1 + 2 = 3, which signifies material as well as spiritual productivity – being powerful spiritually and socially. This Arcanum promises struggle in the economic and social aspect. Hebraic Letter: “Lamed”. Hour: Third Hour of Apollonius. “The Serpents, the Dogs and the Fire”. (Sexual Magic, work with Kundalini.) Transcendent Axiom: “Although the Sun tires you by day and the Moon saddens you at night, do not lose your foothold, nor sleep whilst on guard.” Element of Prediction: “Promises distressing setbacks, falls. Material losses in some conditions of life and gains in ot hers. Presentiments which encourage, and presentiments which discourage.” Arcanum Number 13 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 Arcanum number 13 is Death, but it can also signify something new, there may be wealth, there may be poverty, it is a number of great synthesis. Arcanum number 13 contains the gospel of Judas. Judas represents the death of the “I”. The gospel of Judas is that of Death, it is the dissolution of the ego. Judas symbolises the ego, which one must decapitate. Hebraic Letter: “Mem” Hour: Fourth Hour of Apolloni us. “The neophyte will wander at night amongst the sepulchres, will experience the horror of visions, he will be delivered up to Magic and to Goethia”. (This means that the disciple will see himself attacked by millions of black magicians in the Astral P lane. These sinister magicians try to divert the disciple from the luminous path). Transcendent Axiom: “Night has passed and a new day has arrived, so gird yourself with the arms of light.” Element of Prediction: “Promises disappointments, disillusion ments, death of affections, refusal of that which is sought, collapse, pure delight and pleasure to the Soul, painful improvements, the help of friends. Renewal of conditions, from good to bad, and from bad to good. The good, deteriorating, the bad, impr oving.” Arcanum Number 14 Arcanum number 14 is Chastity, Transmutation, the Waters. One must work hard, chiselling the Stone, without which one cannot achieve sexual transmutation. Hebraic Letter: “Nun” Hour: Fifth Hour of Apollonius. “The superio r waters of heaven.” (During this time the disciple learns to be pure and chaste because he understands the value of the seminal fluid.) Transcendent Axiom: “ Don’t be like straw before the wind, or like the wind before the straw.” Element of Prediction: “Promises friendships, reciprocal affections, obligations, chemical combinations and combination of interests, afflicted loves, devoted loves, treacherous loves. Things which remain, and things which go; the first in order to depart, the second in order to return.” "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 Arcanum Number 15 Arcanum number 15 is the pluralised “I”, which esoterically is called Satan. Arcanum number 15 represents Passion, which is based in the Luciferic Fire. It is necessary to know that the principal defect is sexual passio n, lust. In the kabalistic synthesis of Arcanum 15 we have 1 + 5 = 6, the 6 is sex. This means that sex is the major force which can liberate man, but is also the major force which can enslave him. Arcanum 15 signifies the work with the demon – the proc ess of dissolution of the “I”. Eden is sex itself, and the internal beast, the psychological “I” which blocks our way to Eden, is at the doorway of sex so as to invite us to ejaculate the seminal fluid, or to divert us from that doorway by making us look at schools, theories, sects etc. Hebraic Letter: “Samech”. Hour: Sixth Hour of Apollonius. “Here it is necessary to remain quiet, still due to fear (this signifies the terrible test of the Guardian of the Threshold, before whom one needs great valour to triumph.) Transcendent Axiom: “They made me ward of the vineyards, and the vineyard which was mine, I have not kept.” Element of Prediction: “Promises controversies, passions, misfortunes. Prosperity by way of legality and fate. Harmful affections , both to him who feels them and to whim who is the object of them. Vehement yearnings and violent situations.” Arcanum Number 16 The departure from Eden coincides with Arcanum number 16. Eden or Paradise must be understood as sex itself. We left by the doors of sex, and only through them will we return. Arcanum 16 is very dangerous. It is necessary to awaken consciousness so as to not wander blindly. The blind can fall to the abyss. The Initiate who spills the Vessel of Hermes inevitably falls. The struggle between brain, heart and sex is terrible. If sex dominates the brain, the five - pointed star, the Pentagram is inverted and man, with his head pointing downwards and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 his two feet pointing upwards, is hurled to the depths of the abyss. He fal ls, fulminated with Arcanum 16, which is the Fulminated Tower. They are those who have failed with the Great Work of the Father. Hebraic Letter: “Ajin.” Hour: Seventh Hour of Apollonius. “The fire comforts the inanimate beings, and if some Priest, a m an who is sufficiently purified steals it and projects it, if it is mixed with holy oil and consecrated, it will attain the curation of all illness simply by applying it to the affected part.” The Initiate here sees his material wealth threatened and his dealings fail.) Transcendent Axiom: “Light at dawn, light at midday, light at nightfall, what is important is that there be light.” Element of Prediction: “Promises unforseen accidents, storms, commotions, deaths. Benefits deriving from good and bad c ircumstances. Reciprocity: in love and in hatred, in indifference and in zeal, in betrayal and in loyalty.” Arcanum Number 17 The eight - pointed star always represents Venus, the Morning Star. In Arcanum number 17 we find the Venustic Initiation. The symbol of Venus shows us that the Circle of the Spirit must be above the Cross of Sex, that is to say, sex under the control of the Spirit. The sign inverted, indicates that the Spirit is dominated by sex. Hebraic Letter: “Pe” Hour: Eighth Hour of Ap ollonius. “The astral virtues of the elements, of the seeds of every kind.” Transcendent Axiom: “Some men beg for signs so as to fall, others beg for wisdom so as to act, but the hopeful heart has all in its hopes.” Element of Prediction: “Promises in tuition, sustenance, illumination, births, brief afflictions and brief satisfactions, annoyances and reconciliations, privations, abandonments and gains.” "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 Arcanum Number 18 The Kabalistic synthesis of Arcanum 18 is 1 + 8 = 9, the Ninth Sphere, sex. If we add 9 + 9 = 18, in it there is a balance. One 9 is the positive aspect and the other is the negative aspect, but in essence, the number 18 is negative, harmful, the secret enemies if the Arcanum of Twilight. In the work of the Ninth Sphere one must s truggle a great deal, because one must learn to sublimate the sexual energy; here is the code, or Key to all Empires. In Arcanum 18 we find the dangers of initiation, the hidden and secret enemies who set out to disrupt the initiation, the subterranean st ruggle in the dominion of the Ninth Sphere. In Arcanum 18 we have to fight bloody battles against the sinister, the Black Lodge, the abyss, temptation, the demons who do not want the Initiate to escape from their claws. This is the Path of the Razor’s Ed ge. This is the Path that is filled with dangers, both within and without, as the Venerable Master Sivananda says. In the internal worlds the sinister of Arcanum 18 assault the student violently. In the terrible Arcanum 18 we find the witchcraft of Thes saly, here are found the potions of Canidia, erotic magic ceremonies, rites to make one fall in love, dangerous philtres etc. We must warn Gnostics students that the most dangerous potion which the sinister use to take the students form the Path of the Ra zor’s Edge is the intellect. Hebraic Letter: “Tzadhi.” Hour: Ninth Hour of Apollonius. “Nothing has yet finished. The Initiate increases his perception to even exceed the limits of the solar system, beyond the zodiac. He reaches the threshold of the infinite. He reaches the limits of the intelligible world. The divine Light is revealed, and with it, appear new fears and dangers. (The study of the Minor Mysteries, the nine arcades through which the student must rise.) Transcendent Axiom: “May the granary of your charity be inexhaustible, and your patience no less inexhaustible than your charity.” Element of Prediction: “Promises instability, inconstancy, traps, confusion, changes, uncertain situations, long deliberations, unexpected impediments, belated results, apparent triumphs and failures.” Arcanum Number 19 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 Arcanum number 19 in the Kabalah of Prediction promises total Victory, be it through one’s own efforts or with the help of other persons. Arcanum number 19 is the Arcanum of Victory, or Success. This victory is related with all aspects of life, economic, social, political, moral, etc. The kabalistic synthesis of Arcanum 19 is 1 + 9 = 10 – the 10 is a profoundly sexual number, here we have the circle and the line, the Mysteries of th e Lingam - Yoni. It is not possible to attain Self - Realisation except by means of the transmutation of the sexual energy. In Arcanum 19 a Great Alliance is established between two Souls. Man and woman must kill desire to achieve the Great Alliance, to rea lise the Great Work. Hebraic Letter: “Koph.” Hour: Tenth Hour of Apollonius. “The doors of the heavens open and man comes out of his lethargy.” (This is the number 10 of the second great initiation of Major Mysteries, which allows the Initiate to tra vel with the Etheric Body. This is the wisdom of John the Baptist.) Transcendent Axiom: “Take the shield of your faith and advance with decisive step, be it with a favourable wind, or against all winds.” Element of Prediction: Promises the increase of power, success in undertakings. Joy in the works that are realised. Benefits from compensations for one’s own efforts and those of others. Inheritances. Clarity concerning what is desired, fire which consumes that which is desired. Arcanum Number 2 0 Arcanum number 20 is the Resurrection of the dead. The Resurrection of the Soul is really only possible through Cosmic Initiation. Human beings are dead and can only resuscitate by means of Initiation. Hebraic Letter: “Resch.” Hour: Eleventh Hour of Apollonius. “The Angels, the Cherubim and the Seraphim fly with the murmur of their wings, there is rejoicing in Heaven, the Earth and the Sun which springs from Adam awaken.” (This process belongs to the great initiations of Major Mysteries where on ly the terror of the Law reigns). Transcendent Axiom: “The apple tree in flower, fruit on the vine sown in maturity”. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 Element of Prediction: “Promises harmonious choices, fortunate initiatives, works, gains. Compensations for the good and the bad. Fa ithful friends who annul the actions of treacherous friends. Jealousies for the good which one enjoys. Afflictions due to losses.” Arcanum Number 21 Arcanum 21 can be represented by the inverted Pentagonal Star, which represents Black Magic. Arcanum 21 is Failure, Foolishness, the Fool of the Tarot. In the work of Self - Realisation one is exposed to committing folly. One must work with the Three Factors for the Revolution of Consciousness. 1: To be Born. 2: To Die. 3: Sacrifice for others. Transm utation: Indicates that one must transmute. The brain must control sex. When the brain loses control (of sex), when sex achieves the domination of the brain, then the five - pointed star, man, goes headfirst to the abyss. This is the inverted Pentagram, the symbol of Black Magic. The danger is indicated with precision in this Arcanum by the crocodile. Hebraic Letter: “Shin.” Hour: Twelfth Hour of Apollonius. “The Towers of Fire disturb.” (This is the triumphant entry of the Master into the limitl ess joy of Nirvana, or on the other hand the renunciation of the joy of Nirvana for love of humanity; and he becomes a Bodhisattwa of Compassion). Transcendent Axiom: “My Soul does not enter his secret, nor my ship, his port.” Element of Prediction: “P romises privation of something which one enjoys, blurring of reason upon trying to attain that which on wants, ruin in that, in which one has most vanity, danger of isolation, treacherous gifts, deceitful promises, the end of some things and the beginning of others.” Arcanum Number 22 Arcanum number 22 is the Crown of Life, the Return to the Light, the Incarnation of Truth in us."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 The kabalistic synthesis of Arcanum 22 is 2 + 2 = 4; man, woman, fire and water; the Iod - He - Vau - He, man, woman, phallus, ut erus. Here we have the Holy and Mysterious Tetragrammaton, the Holy Four. Hebraic Letter: “Tau.” Hour: There exists the Thirteenth Hour, which is that of Liberation. Transcendent Axiom: “The sun rises and the sun sets and it returns once again to th e place where it will be reborn.” Element of Prediction: “Promises long life, inheritances, distinctions, enjoyment of honest pleasures, rivals who challenge affections, friends who keep vigil for us, obstacles and the aptitude to overcome them, uncertai n situations and contingencies which clarify them.” "}]
