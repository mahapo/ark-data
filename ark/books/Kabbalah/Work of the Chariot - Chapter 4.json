[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Chapter 6 Chapter6 Meditation and the Mystical Qabalah: Foundation I NTRODUCTION All types of mystical yogic prac tices address one of the two Faces of the NOT ( al ), or both. Vast Face Yoga is impersonal in nature and views all Name and Form as illusions projected by, and in, Mind. It uses the proce ss of discrimination between the Real and the Illusory to renounce all experiences and changes in consciousness through all planes of existence, until individuated consciousness dissolves and merges in the undifferentiated Ground of Pure Being i.e. Ayn ( ]ya ). Small Face Yoga, the yoga of devotion and selfless service, is personal in nature and regards the multiplicity of Name and Form as a Great Unity in Small Face. It is characterized by unconditional love and surrender to one’s Small Face Chosen Ideal, intimacy, compassion, sense of beauty, ritual, and mental renunciation. By far the most common meditative practices in Small Face Yoga in all mystical traditions involve root mantra, visualizations, and often breathing exercises. “So remember ( dikhr ) the Name of Allah and devote thyself with a complete devotion.” 1 The great sage of Arunachala Sri Ramana Maharshi 2 taught: “The eternal, unbroken, natural state of abiding in the Self is jnana [knowledge of the Ayn ]. To abide in the Self, you must love the Self. Since God is verily the Self, love of the Self is love of God and that is bhakti [devotion to One Small Face]. Jnana and bhakti are thus ultimately one and the same.” 3 U SE OF R OOT M ANTRA IN M EDITATION The Tree of Life and Divine Names are two distinct patterns. A particular Name will empower a Tree in a particular way."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"160 Q ABALAH : T HE M YSTICAL H ERITAGE OF THE C HILDREN OF A BRAHAM Different Names can be put on the same Tree, and the Tree will be colored differently in accordance with each Name’s letter formula. The Sefer HaShmoth ( Book of the Names ) designates especially powerful Names that will light the whole Tree. The most common meditative practice of Small Face devotional yoga in all mystical traditions is the repetition of a root mantra combined with an appropriate visualization. In Hebrew, it is called zakhor ; in Arabic, it is called dikhr ; and in Sanskrit, it is called japa and namasmarana . Root mantra are sacred utterances upon which entire religions are built and sustained. A good yogic mantra or string of power names gives the indi vidual consciousness an encoded ladder that will systematically move it through successive levels of the Tree. A well-structured root mantra usually combines a principal Name of Small Face with an appropriate name of Vast Face. It also includes built-in mechanisms to ensure smooth and natural transitions between the plan es of existence and stations of consciousness, and into the roots of the Tree. In the Mystical Qabalah, most such root mantra involve the Name hvhy . “It is very good for a person to depict the letters of the Name hvhy before the eyes of the mind.” 4 Repeating a mantra over time cr eates a sympathetic vibration in the mind. It purifies desires, intensifies unconditional love and surrender, and naturally cultivate s and enhances discrimination, same-sightedness, renunciation, a nd one-pointed concentration. True mantra have an intrinsic power to purify the shells ( qlifoth ). The One Name of Small Face that naturally appeals to each aspirant is called their “Chosen Ideal.” Through years of practice and divine grace, the mind of the meditator literally becomes the mantra that is repeated, and ever ything in the universe is seen as a form of their Chosen Ideal. The intention of repeating a root mantra that includes a Small Face Chosen Ideal is to get the consciousness of Small Face—the male and female active principle of the Ayn ( ]ya ). Small Face is the power of the Ayn to project, preserve, and dissolve a unified Small Face universe. It is also the immense I-ness of the Divine Personality endowed with all possible attributes. When this I-ness is “turned outward” to the Creation, it is stationed in the consciousness that “I am All.” When we awaken to the consciousness of Small Face, we"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"M EDITATION AND THE M YSTICAL Q ABALAH : F OUNDATION 161 realize that we (and all beings) have always been Small Face, not a little individual plagued with suffering. Once a meditator unites with the consciousness of Small Face, there are two options. One is to remain fixed in it for the remainder of this Small Face universe. The second option is to renounce it—meaning you renounce the consciousness of creating, sustaining, and dissolving the universe. In renouncing the consciousness of Small Face, expansion into the undifferentiated consciousness of Vast Face is automatic. The immense I-ness is now turned “Face-to-Face” and united with Vast Face in the awareness that “Nothing alone exists.” Here we learn that Small Face has one great secret - that there is no creation, no destruction, no one in bondage, no one seeking liberation, no one liberated . If our mental matrix survives the experience of the negatively existent roots, we would be able to reemerge as an individuated being in the Small Face Creation as a Tree of Perfection. As a Perfect Tree, the Sefirah Kingdom would have returned to its position as the visible Sefirah Knowledge/First, and the whole uni verse is perceived as a Great Unity in Small Face. Actually, the Sefirah Knowledge/First is always there, but in a fallen state we do not see it, and matter and spirit are perceived as separate in Sefirah Kingdom. C YBERNETICS AND THE M YSTICAL Q ABALAH S MALL F ACE AND THE H UMAN B RAIN Taking a modern perspective that combines neurology, cybernetics, and Jungian ideas, Smal l Face is a Great Unity in the sense that it is a totality archetype, a quintessential fractal that permeates in its entirety every atom of the manifest universe. All possible Small Face totality archetypes are stored in the cerebral cortex of the human brain as the computer equivalent of “compressed files.” A compressed file is a large amount of information configured with optimum efficiency into a minimum amount of storage space. Each individual has a natural affinity for a particular totality archetype due to the karmic impressions (San. samskaras ) which color their lifestream. The composite human brain is an organic, carbon-based computer with four"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"162 Q ABALAH : T HE M YSTICAL H ERITAGE OF THE C HILDREN OF A BRAHAM distinct sub-brains. The underlying 0 level of the brain is a bit count of on-off neurons, similar to the 0 level of a computer with on-off diodes. The on-off condition is set by the resistance (in ohms) of each electrochemical s ynapse to the next neuron. There are multiple branch points (on the order of 10) off of each neuron, so 9 of the 10 channels are high resistance (1 megohm) and one is low resistance (.01 megohm). The information flow follows the low resistance channel. Some 10E11 bits of RAM (read and write memory) are stored in the 100 billion cells of the fourth brain (cerebral cortex), linked by 100 trillion synaptic connections. There are also some 10E10 bits RAM and ROM (read only memory) in the first three brains (commonly referred to as the “reptilian brain”): the medulla, the cerebellum, and the midbrain. This is where the automatic ROM is stored, permitting automatic and semi- automatic physical functions. Our brains have a pictorial readout similar to a TV scan. The reason for this is that logic, speech, and words formed recently in our evolution. Access to information was needed immediately in the form of complete pictures e.g. “this is a sabre tooth tiger, compare what you see with the inner brain picture recalled for a sabre tooth tiger, and RUN!” This has to be done quickly in order to survive, so the people who were able to do it survived and those who could not died out. The usual picture unit is stored in a dissipated way throughout the cerebral cortex. The reason for this is that if a part of the brain is injured and its function impaired, most of the information would still be intact and could be re trieved by the root reconstructing pattern with some bits missing. The 10E11 bits in the fourth brain have to be replenished constantly or they become chaotic. The electrochemical neuronic synapses are replenished by writing the same information over them, which generates the illusion of an ongoing, orderly continuity superimposed over an unperceived negatively existent substratum. And who replenishes the bit stream in the fourth brain? Small Face! This is the basis for the qabalistic teaching that Small Face creates, preserves, and dissolves the universe moment by moment by moment. At the microcosmic level, this means all memories of the past and all hopes for the future, all that you know to be you, is replenished moment by moment. At"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"M EDITATION AND THE M YSTICAL Q ABALAH : F OUNDATION 163 the collective level, anyone or anything can be significantly changed, inserted, or removed from the universe by Small Face at any time. Since all memories and projected futures regarding that person or people would like wise be changed, this could occur without anyone necessari ly knowing that it happened. If this is the case, consider the implications regarding the anticipated messianic action of Acharit ... All totality archetypes are stored in the fourth brain in the “ONE File.” This Unity File is the deep background of brain activity, defined as impressions of past karmic activity and offering standard solutions and standard situations derived from deep memory. A lot of this deep background is contained in genetic coding that is hardwired at the moment of conception. In deep time, all of the brain’s “files” merge into the archetype of the totality i.e. the brain ends up with just the ONE File. The information of a compressed file in a computer is sealed into its storage site with a specified code. In computer parlance, a file of information that is compressed and locked this way is called a “zipped file.” A zipped file is sealed by what is called an executable command. When you activate the executable command, the entire file is opened. In mystical terms, activating the appropriate executable command in the form of a root mantra opens the zipped totality archetype . When we use a specific root mantra to trigger the executable file of a respective Small Face totality archetype, we gradually alter the currents in our synaptic bits by a process of fractal reprogramming. This results in an overall change in the way an i ndividual perceives the Small Face universe. Hence, when you open a totality archetype, it fractalizes and becomes the en tire universe in your individual consciousness. T HE Q ABALISTIC “H OLODECK ” In the science fiction televi sion series “Star Trek,” the Starship Enterprise has an interesting recreational facility called the “Holodeck” that appears in numerous episodes. The Holodeck is essentially an empt y room with a three-dimensional grid superimposed upon the walls. The grid provides a triaxial frame of reference for the ship’s computer to project a three- dimensional hologram. A crew member directs the ship’s"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"164 Q ABALAH : T HE M YSTICAL H ERITAGE OF THE C HILDREN OF A BRAHAM computer to generate a hologram that portrays a specific narrative theme, into which one or more actual crew members can enter and interact on an apparently real time basis. The computer can be directed to modify or end the scenario at any time. A contemporary hologram is a two-dimensional image that is made to look as if it is three-dimensional. It is generated by shining lasers on an object from a number of different directions simultaneously. In the Holodeck, a three-dimensional hologram is made to appear as four-dimen sional i.e. actively changing over time within a consistent set of parameters, with the computer refreshing the bits from moment to moment. Keeping in mind that analogies are only approximations in thought intended to enhance unde rstanding, it is interesting to compare the Holodeck with the qabalistic worldview. The qabalistic worldview describe s the universe as a Small Face totality-dream in the Mind of Vast Face. From that perspective, the space outside the ship would correspond to the negatively existent roots of the Tree (i.e. Ayn ). The walls that form the Holodeck would represent the circular Leviathan of Vast Face surrounding the Tzimtzum . The empty space of the Holodeck would correspond to the vacuum within the Tzimtzum . By the will of Vast Face through the action of Small Face, the Kav (“Line of Light”) enters the Tzimtzum through the point of the Sefirah Crown/Above. The Kav is the clear mirror of the Central Column of the Tree, from which the two side columns are opposite reflections. The grid in the Holodeck would therefore correspond to the pattern of ten Sefiroth that constitute the Tree. The point in the grid with the spatial address <0,0,0> would correspond to Sefirah Crown/Above i.e. the point to which all other points in the grid are referenced to determine their relational addresses. The grid by itself, without a hologram projected upon it, corresponds to the Sefiroth in the World of Emanation. When a human directs the computer to project a hologram upon the grid infrastructure, the ensuing illusion of a three dimensional environment th at can change over time would thus correlate to the Sefiroth extending through the four worlds. The hologram as formless on-off bits in the computer’s memory would correspond to the Creation in the vibrational World of B’riyah. The 3-D hologram as a ma nifest assemblage of subtle"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"M EDITATION AND THE M YSTICAL Q ABALAH : F OUNDATION 165 sound and form patterns would correspond to the Creation in the World of Yetzirah. Finally, the registration and interpretation of those patterns as substantial through the human sensory organs would correspond to the World of Asiyah. What role do the humans play in this configuration? They would correspond to the immense I-ness of Small Face manifesting and experiencing the ma nifold attributes of Its own Divine Personality within the empty dream space of Vast Face. The humans create the physical environment of the Holodeck. They create the computer, which is an extension of the human mind. They choose the thematic content of the holographic narrative, which is an extens ion of the human imagination. And, they enter into, interact with, modify, and terminate the hologram at will while constantly remaining aware that it is only an illusion. And, from where does the hologram come from? Nowhere ( Ayn )! Of what is it made? Nothing ( Ayn )! Where does it go when it ends? No Place ( Ayn )! V AST F ACE -C ENTERED A PPROACH TO A SCENDING THE T REE Some aspirants by nature do not have any attraction for the active, personal Small Face. They do not seek the consciousness of Small Face as a goal, or even as an intermediate stage up the Tree. Such aspirants focus directly on Vast Face and seek to establish a connection in their consciousne ss to the negatively existent substratum in the roots of the Tree. Holding on to the banner of Neti , Neti -“NOT ( al ) This, NOT ( al ) This,” they renounce all Name and Form and all experien ces in the waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep states as illusory. The exceptional strength of concentration and force of will that are requisite to engage in Vast Face practices make them suitable for only a small percentage of aspirants. Such practices are also generally more appropriate for monks who have literally renounced the world and live away from the din and temptations of modern civilization. In the primary mystical literature of all traditions, the allusions and teachings regarding Vast Face are especially obscure and characteristically paradoxical. The practices of Vast Face meditation will be discussed in more detail in a later section of this chapter."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"166 Q ABALAH : T HE M YSTICAL H ERITAGE OF THE C HILDREN OF A BRAHAM H EBREW R OOT M ANTRA AND THE N AME hvhy H As mentioned earlier, almost all the root mantra in the Mystical Qabalah involve the One Small Face Name hvhy . The Name hvhy is called the “ Shem HaMeforesh ” or “Brilliant Name of Fire.” It is often simply referred to as “ HaShem ” (lit. “The Name”), reflecting its central importance. The Name hvhy is conventionally translated in scriptures as “Lord.” Within the context of Hebrew grammar, the “word” hvhy is usually cited as a future tense third person form of the verb root hvh (lit. “to be”). 5 Some regard the word as a composite that combines the past, present, and future tense forms of the verb root. Orthodoxy has proclaimed the pronunciation of the letter- formula hvhy as a Name to be blasphemous. When the Name hvhy is encountered in the To r a h or when chanting prayers, religious Jews will either pause in silence out of respect or substitute another power name, traditionally “ Adonai ” ( ynda lit. my Master). In the Latin Vulgate edition of the Tanakh , Jerome set the precedent of changing the pronunciation of the Yod y to “J” and using the vowels from Adonai to produce the anglicized variation “Jehovah.” Jehovah is th e way that most contemporary non-Jews pronounce the Name hvhy . The Name hvhy is sometimes pronounced “ Yahweh ,” reflecting the tradition that the High Priest in the Temple of Jerusalem made a monosyllabic pronunciation of the Name hvhy on Yom Kippur (Day of At- One-ment). The halachic prohibition specifies to avoid pronouncing the four letters of hvhy as a Name . If one is inclined to follow their prohibition, one can use the Atziluthic version wherein the letters are consider ed to be standing alone, and therefore pronounced individually—“Yod (as in ‘code’),” “Heh (as in ‘day’),” “Vav (as in ‘love’),” “Heh.” The “V’s” in the Vav are pronounced by gently touching the upper bicuspids to the lower lip. The Atziluthic version can be regarded as the most powerful way of pronouncing the Name, because it reflects the condition of the letters in the Sefirah Crown/Above. Among the religions of the world, only Rabbinical Judaism does not pronounce its principal One Name of Small Face. In contrast to the rabbinical prohibition against pronouncing the letter-formula hvhy as a Name, it is interesting to note that there"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"M EDITATION AND THE M YSTICAL Q ABALAH : F OUNDATION 167 are a number of instances in the To r a h where it specifically states that the Lord hvhy was invoked by Name. Hence, it could be inferred that it was a common practice to do so among ancient Hebrews. “And to Seth, in turn, a son was born, and he named him Enosh. It was then that men began to invoke the Lord hvhy by Name .” 6 “From there he moved on to the hill country east of Bethel...and he built there an altar to the Lord hvhy and invoked the Lord hvhy by Name .” 7 “So he [Yitza’aq] erected an altar there [Beersheba] and invoked the Lord hvhy by Name .” 8 P RIMARY M ANTRA FROM THE T ORAH A variety of root mantra of particular importance to the mystical Qabalah are found in the To r a h . Some of the most prominent ones are: 1. The first part of the first of the Ten Commandments: “ Anokhi Yod Heh Vav Heh Elohekha ” ( ;yhla hvhy ykna lit. “I AM YHVH your God”). 9 2. A shorter version of the first Commandment: “ Ani Yod Heh Vav Heh ( hvhy yna lit. “I AM YHVH”). 10 3. The Affirmation of Unity— the “ Shema ” or “ Shem Ayn : ” “Shem AYN Yisroel Yod Heh Vav Heh Elohenu Yod Heh Vav Heh Echa D ” ( dxa hvhy vnyhla hvhy larsy ims lit. “Name Ayn Israel YHVH our Elohim YHVH One”). 11 4. The Vast Face mantra at the root of Pesach (Passover): “ Shomer Mah MeLylah ” ( hlylm hm rms , literally, “Watcher WHAT of the Night”). 12 5. The Vast Face mantra: “ Ani Ayn ” ( ]ya yna , literally “I AM the Ayn ”). 6. The Vast Face mantra: “ Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh ” ( hyha rsa hyha , literally, “I will be, THAT, I will be”). 13 To take a mantra in meditati on involves repeating it silently or out loud, usually in combination with an appropriate visualization. The visualization can be “seen” in the heart center Sefirah Beauty/Last (approximately at the thoracic cavity), or in"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"168 Q ABALAH : T HE M YSTICAL H ERITAGE OF THE C HILDREN OF A BRAHAM front of the eyes. One can perform the visualization with eyes closed or open. It was cited that “Brilliant Name of Fire” ( Shem HaMeforesh ) is a descriptive title for the Name hvhy . Hence, in using a root mantra centered upon the Name hvhy , the process of creative imagination is used to visualize the Name as “dancing letters of fire” against a solid black, circular background. The black circular background represents the Contraction ( Tzimtzum ). The black circular background can be placed against a light blue background as the ne gatively existent Endless Light (see Figure 6.1).

While we are all familiar with the color of fire, there is no rigid prescription prohibiting an individual from using other colors such as white, red, gold, or even black for the fire letters. One might also prefer to use a different color for the solid circular background. A med itator may visualize the linear form or the Yo s h e r (upright) form of the Name hvhy as dancing letters of fire. We could see th e Name as flaming Ezra Hebrew letters or as flaming Sinatic Hebrew letters. More instructions for meditations that employ the Hebrew root mantra are provided in Chapter Seven. The mantra “ Ani Yod Heh Vav Heh” is found in numerous places in the To r a h and it is especially recommended for its simplicity and proven effectiveness. The word Ani ( yna ) is now a common word in colloquial spoken Hebrew. It has come to mean “I am,” and is used when referring to oneself in the context of conventional speech. In the Sefer HaShmoth ( Book of the Names ) and in biblical Hebrew, Ani is a power name of Vast Face, and thereby refers to the Divine Self as Pure Existence. When “ Ani Yod Heh Vav Heh ” is used as a mantra in meditation, the ladder of the four letters of the Name hvhy will move the consciousness of the meditator up the Tree and through the four worlds. Then, the Yod y of hvhy becomes the Yod y of Ani , and the consciousness of the meditator merges with the witness states of Vast Face in the negatively existent roots of the Tree. In the roots of the Tree, the Nun n and Yod y in Ani yna exchange places: Ani has now become Ayn ]ya , the Mysterious Unknown at the Roots of the Thing. The mantra “ Ani Yod Heh Vav Heh” is versatile in that it can be built upon. Any additional Di vine Name, attribute, or gatekeeper, to which the mind of an aspirant is attracted, can be added to Ani hvhy . Examples are: Ani hvhy Shekhinah Belimah ( hmylb hnyks , Intangible Presence), Ani hvhy Ahavah ( hbha , Love), Ani hvhy Echad ( dxa , Unity), Ani hvhy Avraham ( ,hrba , Master Abraham ), etc. The visualization used can be modified according to what is added to the mantra. The visualizations could be s imple or complex. For instance, with “ Ani hvhy Shekhinah Belimah ,” one could visualize Queen Shekhinah seated upon the stump of a tree in the middle of a beautiful forest.

Her hands are in Her lap, palms upward, and She has a crown on Her head around which is the twenty-two Atziluthic letters. To Her immediate right and left are trees representing the Side Columns of the Tree of Life. The full moon shines above the trees in the night sky above Her. The flaming letters of the Name hvhy shimmer in Her heart center, cradled just above Her hands. Brilliant gold light shines forth in all directions from Her body, Her face veiled by the light. The “ Shema ” is the best known and most revered root mantra in the Jewish religion. According to the Zohar , it should be pronounced “ Shem AYN Yisroel Yod Heh Vav Heh Elohenu Yod Heh Vav Heh Echa---- D .” In the To r a h , the letters Ayin i (in “ Shem Ayin ” i ms ) and Dalet d (in “ Echad ” d xa ) are greatly enlarged. Together, they make the secret root Name “ OD ” di (pronounced “ood”), the literal mean ing of which is often said to be “Eternity.” 14 In this root mantra, Shem Ayn ims is the NOT ( al ), the negatively existent Mysterious Unknown, the Hidden of Hidden Ones. Yisroel ( larsy ) is the Supernal Israel, the witness states (Alef Worlds) of Vast Face in Atziluth, and the Name hvhy is the Small Face totality archetype. Elohenu ( vnyhla , our Elohim ) refers to the creative aspect of Small Face in general, and the consciousne ss of our local Star (Sun) in particular. The mantra then returns to the station of Small Face with the repetition of hvhy . It climaxes with EchaD ( dxa ), alluding to the Great Unity of Vast and Small Face. In using the “ Shem Ayn ” for meditation, one can visualize the Name hvhy as dancing letters of fire on a black circular background against a light blue background, as previously described. The root mantra and holiest utterance in the Qur’an is “ La Illaha Il Allah (Hu) .” Maimomades the “Rambam” asserted that this utterance and the “ Shem Ayin ” are essentially the same. 15 “ La ” is the NOT ( al ), “ Illaha ” is Vast Face, “ Il ” is the “glue” between Vast and Small Face, and Allah is the Small Face totality archetype. Hu refers to the visible Sefirah Knowledge/First in the throat center seen from the Sefirah Crown/Above in Atziluth on a Perfect Tree.

Sufis, the Qabalists of Islam, call the process of “taking the Name” or repeating root mantra “ dikhr ” (lit. remembrance), which is the equivalent of the Hebrew word “ zakhor ” ( rkz ) in the context of the Mystical Qabalah. “Unify the Holy Name Bind the Knot of Faith, Bring blessings to the proper place.” 16 T HE M OODS OF D EVOTIONAL Y OGA The moods of the yoga of devotion to Small Face vary. Some devotees may have a strong emotional sense of being creatures in the Lord hvhy ’s (or any other Small Face Chosen Ideal) dream- universe. Others may feel like servants of the Lord hvhy the Master; or like the Lord hvhy ’s dear friend, sister, or brother; or like the Lord hvhy ’s wife, or husband, or secret paramour. Devotional Yoga can bring to the forefront the highest fruits of each mood, and spill over into relations with family, friends, teachers, lovers, and strangers. Devotional Yoga seeks a personal, intimate relation with the Divine, infused with devotional passion and fulfilling one’s deepest emotional needs. Some of the clearest and most detailed accounts of the experiences associated with devotional moods are found in the teachings of the Vaishnavas of Bengal in Northern India. The Vaishnavas are ardent devotees of Vishnu’s incarnations, especially Rama, Krishna, and Chaitanya. In Vaishnava teachings, the moods of love are called bhavas , and they are taken to their highest possible spiritual expression in bhava samadhi (lit. devotional mood union). Bhava samadhi is ecstatic absorption in one’s Chosen Ideal in the context of a particular mood. The highest (and rarest) of the bhavas in the Vaishnava teachings is called madhura bhava (lit. Sweet Mood). The madhura bhava is the female mood of the wife/paramour toward God-the-Husband or Secret Beloved, characterized by prema (ecstatic love). In Vaishnava literature, the madhura bhava is embodied in Radha, a principal consort of Sri Krishna, and in"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"172 Q ABALAH : T HE M YSTICAL H ERITAGE OF THE C HILDREN OF A BRAHAM Sita, wife of Rama . All of the devotional moods are found variously among devotees in all my stical traditions relative to their respective Chosen Ideals. Within the mystical community, there are some aspirants who have awakened to a condition of permanent awareness in the lower astral states of the World of Yetzirah. Most such individuals access this station of consciousness by exiting the waking state; some are able to access it while simultaneously maintaining an operative awareness in the waking state. Either way, there is some danger that attachment to this type of psychic ability can be an entrapment that inhibits further spiritual growth. Among advanced devotees, there are some who awaken to a condition of continuous awareness of their Chosen Small Face Ideal within the context of a particular bhava . As with the lower psychic condition described above, most access this state by exiting their bodies in sleep or trance. A smaller number are seen to maintain a simultaneous awareness in the waking state of Asiyah, and the higher astral states of Yetzirah. Hence, while in the waking state, they may literally see the form of their Chosen Ideal everywhere, in everything. While this station is more desirable than entrapment in the lower psychic states, it can still present a temptation to become addicted to the bliss of this experience, preventing further progress up the Tree. Overcoming such an addiction is no smal l task, and often requires the intervention of an advanced spiritual mentor. Also, frequent intense ananda samadhis can be especially taxing to the nervous system of most humans. V AST F ACE M EDITATION P RACTICES Some souls, possessed of extr aordinary strength of mind and personal resolve, are not attr acted to meditation on God-with - Name-and Form, but rather are naturally inclined to meditate on Vast Face—God-without -Name-and-Form. In other traditions, Vast Face meditation is practiced among the Shaivites and Advaita Vedantins in India, the Theravada, Tendai, Shingon, Tibetan, Ch’an, and Zen Buddhists, and the Wu Wei (Non- Action) Taoists. 17 The Shaivites envision the pure consciousness of Vast Face as Shiva , and the energy of that consciousness as"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"M EDITATION AND THE M YSTICAL Q ABALAH : F OUNDATION 173 His consort the Goddess Kali . The Vedantic philosophy of advaita (non-duality) regards all Name and Form as illusory, and that Brahman (i.e. the Ayn ) alone exists. Theravada, Hinayana, Tendai, Shingon, Tibetan, Ch’an, and Zen Buddhists perform variations of Vast Face med itation practices taught by Gautama Buddha (regarded as the eighth incarnation of Vishnu by Hindus) and other bodhisattvas (souls who reach enlightenment but remain incarnate to teach and help others awaken). The Buddha practiced jnana yoga (lit. union through direct perception of the Ayn ) and taught ashtanga yoga (lit. eight-limbed yoga of concentration and discrimination) . He sat under the Bodhi Tree, renouncing all experiences on all planes of existence. Seeing that all the koshas (Sanskrit word for shells of embodied existence) were empty, he perceived the u ltimate Truth of Pure Being in nirvana . The Vast Face Taoists follow “quietist practices” that lead them to Stillness in the Tao. The principal mood, or bhava , of Vast Face Yoga is called the “ shanti bhava” (peaceful mood). Vast Face meditation practices include letting the mind rest in its natural state, following the breath, using specialized Vast Face mantra and visualizations, and contemplating paradox e.g. Zen koans . Verbal practices include chanting and contemplating non- dual centered scriptural texts such as the Upanishads of the Hindu Rishis, the Buddhist Prajna Paramita , and the Qabalistic Sifra Detzniyutha . The “Neti, Neti” (“NOT this, NOT this”) process of discriminating Self-inqui ry is used to discern the Real by negating the Unreal. The yogic instructions of Sri Ramana Maharshi, for instance, emphasized a process of inquiry as to the real nature of “Who am I?”: “Who am I? The gross body that is composed of the seven humors ( dhatus ), I am not. The five cognitive senses that apprehend their respective objects i.e. sound, touch, color, taste, odor, I am not. The five cognitive organs i.e. speech, locomotion, touch, excretion, and procreation, with their respective functions, I am not. The five vital airs ( prana , etc.), I am not. Even the mind that thinks, I am not. The neiscience too, which is endowed only with the residual impressions of objects, and in which there are no objects and no functions, I am not.

These three appear at the same time and disappear at the same time.” 83 In the Zohar ( Book of Splendor ), Shir HaShirim ( Song of Songs attributed to King Solomon), and elsewhere, the Hebrew Small Face is described as “raven-haired” and “black-bearded.” Vast Face conversely is frequently referred to as the “white- haired, white-bearded, hoary Ancient of Days.” For example: “White are His garments, and His appearance is the likeness of a Face vast and terrible. 18 “...the Head of Days, His Head white and pure as wool. And His raiment indescribable.” 19 In the Mahanirvana Tantra , we find Shiva described as: “He who is white as camphor and the jasmine flower, the Omnipresent One.” 20 In Sir John Woodroffe’s book The Garland of Letters , we find the translated inscription: “She [Small Face as Divine Mother] stands upon the white, corpse-like Shiva . He is white because He is the illuminating, transcendental aspect of Consciousness. He is inert because He is the changeless aspect of the Supreme, and She the apparently changing aspect of the same. In truth, She and He are One and the same, being twin aspects of the One...” 21 In the To r a h , there are a variety of images alluding to the station of Vast Face, such as “Darkness AL ( li lit. upon) the Face of the Deep” 22 We also find a prominent image of the Ancient of Days in the Revelation of John , described as having “fiery eyes and a two-edged sword coming from His mouth” (Figure 6.2). Then, there is the reference to “darkness upon thick darkness” in the “Light Surah ” of the Qur’an . 23 “Or like darkness in a vast ocean [Vast Face], Covered with waves upon waves,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"M EDITATION AND THE M YSTICAL Q ABALAH : F OUNDATION 175 Over them clouds, darkness upon thick darkness [i.e. Face to Face]. And whoever Allah gives NOT- Light has NOT- Light in all.” The “Night of Power” Surah in the Qur’an also alludes to the direct experience of Vast Face consciousness: “In the name of Allah , the Merciful, the Compassionate, Truly, We have sent This [Vast Face Name] in the Night of Power [Vast Face samadhi ]. And What [Vast Face Name] is the Night of Power. The Night of Power is better than a thousand nights; The angels and the Spirit descend in It by the will of their Lord. It is peace for all until the rise of dawn.” The prize of the yoga of knowledge/realization of the Ayn ( ]ya ) is called “ nirvikalpa samadhi ” (lit. union with God- without-qualities) in Sanskrit. Nirvikalpa samadhi is the complete extinction of individua ted consciousness in union with the Mysterious Unknown. Swami Vivekananda, a great disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, wrot e the following “Hymn of Samadhi :” 24 “LO! The Sun is not, nor the comely Moon, all Light extinct; In the great Void of space floats shadow-like the image universe. In the Void of Mind-involute there floats the fleeting universe, Rises and floats, sinks again ceaseless, in the current ‘I.’ Slowly, slowly, the shadow multitude enters the primal womb, And flows ceaseless the only current. ‘I AM, I AM.’ Lo! ‘Tis stopped, even the current flows no more, Void merged into Void - beyond speech and mind; Whose heart understands, he knows the Truth.”"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"176 Q ABALAH : T HE M YSTICAL H ERITAGE OF THE C HILDREN OF A BRAHAM F IGURE 6.2 Ancient of Days ( Peshitta ) When the connection is opened via nirvikalpa samadhi to the substratum of the Ayn , everything disappears, including the idea of the substratum.

You continue as this program. The old self is totally gone, like a salt doll dissolved in the ocean. To even conceive of this is very difficult. Hence, most people who have an interest in spiritual awakening are more comfortable at focusing their yogic effort on changing their consciousness, and thereby their universe, into a unitive Small Face totality archetype. Indeed, only a small percentage of spiritual aspirants have the mental constitution and strength to pursue Vast Face consciousness, without first establishing their consciousness in a Small Face totality archetype. Through a process of discrimination, Small Face devotees can get to Vast Face consciousness by renouncing their Small Face Chosen Ideal. In practice, most find that they are unable to renounce that One who has become most dear to their hearts, and who is seen as literally filling their entire universe. W HAT H APPENS W HEN Y OU A SCEND THE T REE OF L IFE ? I NTRODUCTION In ascending the Tree, the individuated consciousness expands through the successive shells, with their respective states and stations, and associated powers. Consciousness in the Geviyah (astral shell) gives control over the dream state and lower psychic states, and can afford such powers as astral projection, clairvoyance, precognition, and “reading” the Earth’s Akashic Record. 25 The Nefesh (physical body in the waking state of the World of Asiyah) shuts out the bulk of information coming from the Geviyah (astral body) because the Nefesh vibrates at a much slower rate. The station of the Ruach Ha Qodesh (Holy Spirit, causal body) in the Sefirah Beauty/Last is normally experienced as deep sleep. The awakening of consciousness in the Ruach Ha Qodesh in the World of B’riyah is usually experienced as an ecstatic and exclusive experience of one’s Small Face Chosen Ideal. In Sanskrit, this experience is called “ ananda samadhi ” (bliss union) and “ salvikalpa samadhi ” (God- with-Qualities union). This vision is often filtered through the astral senses of the Geviyah in Yetzirah, so that the form of the Small Face is actually seen and heard.

The awakening of the Ruach HaQodesh generally liberates the soul from further incarnations of the Geviyah . Upon passing from the Nefesh (i.e. dying from the physical body), the soul retains its separation and resi des in ecstatic bliss “at the feet of their Beloved” for the durati on of the Small Face universe. Through discrimination and th e renunciation of a dualistic relationship with one’s Small Face Chosen Ideal, the individual consciousness can continue to expand and ascend the Central Column, cross the Abyss of the invisible Sefirah Knowledge/ First, and merge with the Neshamah (Divine Soul) in the Sefirah Crown/Above in the World of Atziluth. This is experienced as a witness state the size of the Small Face universe. In merging with the Neshamah , all separation between the individual and Small Face dissolves. By renouncing the manifestation of Mind- generated universes, “Face turns toward Face” and the universe vanishes like waking up from a dream. Consciousness thereby automatically moves into the Neshamah HaNeshamah (Soul of the Soul), merging with the negatively existent witness states of Vast Face in the roots of the Tree. In the Qabalah, the unmanifest witness states of Vast Face are called “Alef Worlds,” in distinction to the manifest “Beyt Worlds” of Small Face. Hence, we see that Torah B’reshith , the Zohar , the Sefer Yetzirah , and the Qur’an all begin with words whose first letter is Beyt. 26 The station in the roots of the Tree is also called the World of the Yechidah (Singularity). “Therefore, the Secret of Secrets is what men can neither know nor comprehend, nor can they apply their rules of science to It.” 27 “The Head ( Rosh , sar ) of Above, the Holy Ancient One, Mystery of All Mysteries, Head of All Heads, the Head which is NOT ( al ), a Head which is in NOT ( al ), known as NOT ( al ); what is knowable in the Head is NOT ( al ) connected with Wisdom and NOT ( al ) connected with Understanding.” 28 Figure 6.3 displays the generation of the To r a h emanating from the unmanifest singularity of Yechidah .

Normal humans cannot sustain th is experience for very long without shattering the shells. The average person gets several momentary flashes of consciousness in the higher centers in their lifetime, but usually buries them deeply as traumatic experiences. Meditation gradually desensitizes the mind to accept such flashes as legitima te yogic experiences, thereby making it possible to sustain the experience much longer. In Sri Ramakrishna the Great Master , Swami Saradananda relates the dramatic account of Master Ramakrishna sustaining and surviving six months of unbroken nirvikalpa samadhi after being struck on the forehead with a sharp rock by the sannyasin Tota Puri. 29 The Qur’an alludes to the Vast Face samadhi experience of the Prophet Mohammed as the “N ight of Power,” described as “better than a thousand nights.” The To r a h also makes references to the Vast Face samadhi experiences of Mosheh and Abraham: “And Mosheh knew THAT-NOT; the skin of His Face shone.” 30 “As the sun set, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great darkness descended upon him.” 31 “And I will put you in a cleft of the rock while I pass by you. And I will take My Hand away and you shall see My Ultimate, And My Face of NOT ( al ) shall be seen.” 32 A SCENT OF THE T REE VIA THE “P ATH OF hvhy E LOHENU ” In ascending the Central Column on the Way of hvhy Elohenu (see Figure 6.3), the consciousness of the traveler first moves from the waking state of the Nefesh in Sefirah Kingdom into the dream state of the Geviyah in Sefirah Foundation/Below. This is done by passing through the Gate of the Beyt b that connects Sefirah Kingdom to Sefirah Foundation/Below. Most people do this every night and experience it as an unconscious state of REM sleep. However, if the gate is traversed while maintaining awarenness, it will be experienced as a conscious dream state from which one can move further up the Tree. Sefirah Foundation/Below is the point of departure from which we may either enter the psychic states by passing through one of"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"M EDITATION AND THE M YSTICAL Q ABALAH : F OUNDATION 181 the gates into the side columns, or into higher states of consciousness by moving further up the Central Column. From Sefirah Foundation/Below, the traveler on the Way of hvhy Elohenu moves through the Gate of the Gimel g into the Ruach HaQodesh (Holy Spirit qlifah ) in Sefirah Beauty/Last. Sefirah Beauty/Last in the World of B’riyah is experienced every night by almost all humans as deep sleep. In consciously passing through the Gate of the Gimel g , the awakening of consciousness in the Ruach HaQodesh in the heart Sefirah Beauty/Last is accompanied by great bliss. The individuated consciousness sustains the constant and exclusive experience of its Chosen Small Face Ideal. This vision often filters down through the astral senses of the Geviyah , so that the Chosen Ideal is seen and heard. Attachment to the bliss experience of Small Face in the Ruach HaQodesh must be renounced if the aspirant is to further ascend the Tree. At that point, the experience may deepen further into the formless World of B’riyah through Sefirah Beauty/Last, or continue to move up the Central Column of the Tree. The Gate of the Gimel g is a mirror upon which collects the residue of karmic impressions (San. samskaras ) of many lifetimes. Hence, in the beginning stages, when we move consciously into Sefirah Foundation/Below, we will often next see the “Watcher on the Threshold” in the mirror of the Gate of the Gimel g . The Watcher is actually the reflection of our own reincarnating Geviyah . People typically run in fear from their Watcher when they encounter it in their dream state. But, the Geviyah is a plastic medium subject to change. Repeating the Name of one ’s Chosen Small Face Ideal (e.g. the Lord hvhy ) cleanses the Geviyah of the seeds of impure desires and spiritual ignorance that have crystallized during past life activity. With the purification of the Geviyah , the Watcher is replaced by the reflection of the Form of one’s Chosen Small Face Ideal, or by a high level gatekeeper, or may even become transparent i.e. clear. When the reflection in the mirror of the Gimel g is transparent i.e. cleared of reflection, the soul becomes invisible to the gatekeepers in the side columns of the Tree, and all paths can be traversed without conflict or obstruction. Such a soul is “Master of the Tree.” A good tip is: if you awaken in the Geviyah in Yetzirah and become aware of the Watcher, instead of running from it, ignore any intrepidation you feel and proceed to go right through it."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"182 Q ABALAH : T HE M YSTICAL H ERITAGE OF THE C HILDREN OF A BRAHAM Many people get side tracked by attachment to psychic powers that can come when they awaken in their Geviyah and elect to move from Sefirah Foundation/Below into either of the side columns. One is well advised to resist that temptation, and eschew such powers when they arise. They will generally go away in a few weeks by simply ignoring them. As mentioned previously, some people develop simultaneous awareness in the waking state and the astral states. This can be quite disconcerting until one becomes comfortable with it. One condition that should be looked for is when a person has uncontrollable “outs” i.e. they have sporadic events in which they shoot out of their physical body, which thereby goes limp. If this starts to happen, it is a flag that one should decrease the intensity or take a hiatus from spiritual practices. This can also happen to women during sexual intercourse through the hyperstimulation of the nerves at th e interior end of the vagina. Such sexually caused or tantric outs can send the woman into a blissful state of ananda samadhi . Repeated samadhis of varying duration generated this way can dangerously strain the nervous system and, despite the lure of prolonged states of ecstasy, should be approached with caution and temperance.

It does not have gatekeepers who must be satisfied to proceed further. The usual early response to the experience of the Shell of Terror is extreme fear due to the ego’s false identification with the mortal physical shell i.e. “I am going to die, I am going to die.” Regarding this, Proverbs says: “The fear of (or reverence for) the Lord hvhy is [at] the beginning of wisdom.” “Beginning” is the Sefirah Knowledge/First, and “wisdom” is the Sefirah Wisdom/East. When the ego is dehypnotized, allowing for its proper identification with Small Face, then fear is replaced by love and the traveler is able to move through the Shell of Terror without fearing the extinction that is to follow. If consciousness becomes temporarily distracted into the Right or Left Columns, it has no recourse on the Tree of hvhy Elohenu but to return to the Central Column, since there are no gates connecting the Sefiroth vertically up the Right and Left Columns. After passing into Sefirah Beauty/Last, the next step in ascending the Central Column in the Way of hvhy Elohenu is to pass through the Gate of the Alef a . The Gate of the Alef a connects Sefirah Beauty/Last with Sefirah Crown/Above, traveling across the Face of the Abyss of the invisible Sefirah Realization/First at the throat center. In Qabalah, the Gate of the Alef a is called the “Sword Bridge.” It is called s irata (“straight path”) in the Fatiha (The Opening) of the Qur’an , and chinuvad (“connecting link”) in the Zend Av es t a of the Zoroastrians. The Peshitta describes it as “strait is th e gate and narrow is the way.” By maintaining the balance between the Sefiroth Mercy/Good and Power/Evil, and then between Wisdom/East and Understanding/North, the pilgrim may pass through the Shell of Terror, cross the Abyss, and enter the supernal World of Atziluth in Sefirah Crown/Above.

By renouncing attachment to the experience of this dream unive rse, consciousness automatically moves into the Neshamah HaNeshamah (Soul of the Soul, equates to Sanskrit Paratman ) in the negatively existent roots of the Tree. In the Mystical Qabalah, it is said that “spiritual life begins with the realization of the Ayn ( ]ya )!” When (and if...) a soul reemerges from complete extinction in the Divine Essence in the roots of the Tree, it returns to consciousness in Sefirah Crown/ Above.
