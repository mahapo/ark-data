He received a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy from Columbia University and a Bachelor's Degree from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York City in 1964. He was awarded a Master of Hebrew Letters Degree from the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1967, and the following year was ordained a Rabbi. Continuing his concentration in the History of Jewish Philosophy and Mysticism, Dr. Bland attended Brandeis University where he earned a Doctoral Degree in Medieval Jewish-Islamic Philosophy in 1971. His experiences include teaching courses in Jewish Theology at the Jewish Theological Seminary, and a course in Medieval Jewish Philosophy at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Philadelphia. He has taught for two years at Indiana University, as well as The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Since 1977, he has been a faculty member at Duke University where he served as Chairman of the Department of Religion for six years. Currently, he is the Director of Duke's Center for Judaic Studies. He also regularly teaches in the Masters of Arts Program in Liberal Studies. In 1986, he was honored with a Distinguished Undergraduate Teaching Award. His publications include a number of studies and edited texts in medieval and renaissance Jewish philosophy, mysticism and biblical commentary. His topics range from medieval theories of the intellect and immortality to Maimonides' notion of mosaic prophecy. His recent scholarly interests have turned in the direction of medieval Jewish ideas of art and beauty and to the modern myth of Jewish antagonism toward the visual arts. Currently, he is writing a book, tentatively titled, \"Sensing Judaism: Medieval Jewish Culture and Aesthetics.\" He is reported to be a rank amateur musician, playing the viola in his spare time. 1996 The Teaching Company Limited Partnership"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"COURSE OBJECTIVES Lecture One: Historical Framework for Jewish Mysticism These lectures begin by offering an historians answers to two rather straightforward questions: What is Jewish about Jewish Mysticism (Kabbalah)? What is mystical about Jewish Mysticism? The lectures end with an historians attempt to understand our contemporary fascination with such arcane subjects. Along the way, the major trends in Late Antique, medieval, early modern, and modern Jewish mysticisms are introduced. Their characteristic beliefs and meditational techniques are described. The audience may reasonably expect to come away from these lectures having learned something useful about the academic study of religion, the complexity of Judaism's creative impulses, and the astonishing resources of human imagination as it struggles to de-habituate the everyday in order to discover infinities in grains of sand. Honoring the liberal injunction to let nothing human be alien to us, these lectures are designed to demystify the Kabbalah. They do not seek to judge whether the Kabbalah is morally good or bad, healthy-minded or pathological, philosophically true or empirically false, but to discover what made the Kabbalah possible or attractive to its adherents and implausible or repellent to its opponents. Being an optimist, the lecturer assumes that, just as we are not obliged to become triangles in order to grasp the Pythagorean Theorem, we need not be Jewish Kabbalists in order to fathom Jewish Mysticism. A mere handful of lectures cannot do justice to the two-thousand years of Jewish history during which a plethora of mystical traditions evolved. They cannot chart the many striking parallels and the equally striking dissimilarities between the Kabbalah, Christian mysticism, Sufism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. But they can make visible the otherwise hidden processes by which medieval Jewish mystics-like their counterparts, the medieval Jewish philosophers and theologians-transformed the heritage of biblical and rabbinic Judaism. With ingenious legerdemain, they aligned it with ancient mythic consciousness and newfangled metaphysical doctrines that stressed the conflict between outer appearances and inner realities. The lectures can suggest something of the competition between the philosophic and mystical traditions and explain why mysticism succeeded where philosophy failed. The lectures can also catch glimpses of Jewish history through the lens of the mystics, just as they can identify some of the mystical factors shaping Jewish communal life and ritual practice. Perhaps most importantly of all, the lectures can provide members of the audience with sufficient historical background, technical terminology, and clarification of fundamental concepts to allow them to confront critically the primary sources of Jewish Mysticism as they become more readily available every day. Being an optimist, the lecturer hopes so. Introducing the course, this lecture raises two questions: What is Jewish about Jewish Mysticism? and, What is mystical about Jewish Mysticism? It answers these questions by contrasting traditional claims to antiquity with modern academic assumptions about historical change. It then correlates Jewish Mysticism with Jewish history, and argues that the mystical tradition is characterized by special doctrines and meditation techniques that alter ordinary states of consciousness.

This lecture analyzes several representative examples of prayer and midrash selected from the classical rabbinic sources.

This lecture traces the triumph of interiority, ascetic dualism, and Platonic disregard of outward appearances in Jewish Pietistic circles living in the Rhine Valley of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.

It emerged dramatically in late twelfth-century Provence and continued to unfold throughout the thirteenth century, culminating in the magnum opus of Kabbalah, the Zohar. This lecture introduces the concept of theosophy by examining the doctrine of metempsychosis (transmigration of the soul) as it was expressed in the Book of Dazzlement (Bahir) and the doctrine of creation/theogony in Moses ben Nahmans thirteenth-century Commentary on the Bible.

This lecture continues to develop the themes introduced in the Fifth Lecture by using the terms and principles of Freudian psychoanalysis as a heuristic device for understanding the mystical consciousness of universal inter-relatedness. This lecture seeks to explain what it might mean to say as above, so below or to claim that reality is an interlocked set of microcosms mirroring one another and the macrocosm. I.

A close reading of the Zohars inventively chivalrous insights into the biblical Song of Songs reveals how unapologetically audacious the mystics were in eroticizing the cosmos and in staking their claims to sacramental power. The lecture also shows that the mystics were well aware of what they were up against: benevolent and demonic evil. Divine Consequences of Human Behavior A.

This lecture introduces the paradoxical Sabbatians of the seventeenth-century and the Hasidic movement of East Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Despite the enormous differences between them, the Sabbatians and the Hasidim were fascinated by the personalities and sacred biographies of their leaders.

Scholarly interest in the mystical origins of modern science, developments in modern non-representational art, feminism, fascination with Oriental cultures, enchantment with psychology, and the appeal of neo-Orthodox theologies all contribute to the contemporary revival of interest in the Kabbalah.
