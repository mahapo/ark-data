[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" Pronunciation Guide to Sephiroth, Letters and Divin e Names used on the Tree of Life, with some additions for the Lesse r Pentagram Ritual. Adapted from: \"QABALAH No. 1\" by Bill Heidrick, Copyright (c) 1982 and from: \"O.T.O. Newsletter\" #4, pp. 11-14, Copyright (c) 1978 There are two common methods for pronouncing Hebrew, the Ashkenazic or German style and the Sephardic or Spanish style. The suggestions given below are for Sephardic pronunci ation. Sephardic is closer to ancient Hebrew than is Ashkenazic. THE MOST COMMON NAMES OF THE SEPHIROTH: First Sephira: KETER, KThR, meaning \"Crown. Ke-ter --- e as in met. Acc ent first syllable. Second Sephira: CHOKMAH, ChKMH, meaning \"Wisdom\". Chok-Ma --- ch is a cough-li ke sound. o like in born. a like in father. Accent last syllable. Third Sephira: BINAH, BYNH, meaning \"Understanding\" Bi-Na --- i like in polic e. a like in father. Accent last syllable. The Latent Sephira: DA'AT, Da'aTh, meaning \"Knowledge\". Da-at --- a double \"a\" sound like that in bard. These two \"a\" sounds are separated by a \"glottal stop\", a sudden interrupt ion of breath by very brief closing of the epiglottis. This unique sound is not used in English speech, but is sometimes used in German and in many other languages. When the Letter Ayin occurs in the middle of words, it almost always requires this effect. Accent the first sy llable. Fourth Sephira: CHESED, ChSD, meaning \"Mercy\". Che-sed --- Ch is a cough-like sound. Both e's are like in met. Accent first syllable. Fifth Sephira: GEBURAH, GBVRH, meaning \"Severity\".

ATEH, AThH, meaning \"THINE\" or \"UNTO THEE\" At-Ta --- First a li ke in bard. Second a like in father. Accent second syllable. MALKUT, --- see above under Sephiroth.

The \"a'a\" signifies a very light glottal stop; omit if too difficult. o as in bore. a as in father. The \"La\" is accented, but the sound should drop back to normal by the time you reach \"m\". AMEN, AMN, meaning an assertion of strong conviction. Am-En --- a as in fat her. E as in bet. Accent last syllable. Note: This word is used intact in English, but does not have quite t he same religious connotations in Hebrew. There is no actual English equivalent outside profanit y and slang. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"JEHOVAH, ADONAI, EHEIEH --- see above under Divine Names. AGLA, AGLA, no direct meaning. This is a Noteriqon or mystical abbreviation of: AThH GBVR L-a'aVLM ADNY, Ateh Gibor Le-Olahm Adonai. That in turn means: \"Thou art m ighty forever O'Lord\". Pronunciation is also cryptic, but using the initials of the component words and their attendant vowel points, we get: A-gi-le-A --- a as in bard. i as in bit. e as the first one in believe. A as in bard. The last syllable should take the accent, but even sylliblation i s undecided. RAPHAEL, RPAL, meaning \"GOD HEALS\" Re-Fa-El --- e as first one in believe. a as in father. e as in bet. Accent the last two syllables. GABRIEL, GBRYAL, meaning \"GOD IS MIGHTY\" Gab-Ri-El --- a as in ba rd. i as in police. E as in bet. Accent the last two syllables. MICHAEL, MYKAL, meaning \"LIKENESS OF GOD\" Mi-Ka-El --- i as in poli ce. K like a light clearing of the throat. a as in father. E as in bet. Accent the last two syllabl es. URIEL, ARIEL, AVRYAL, meaning \"LIGHT OF GOD\", or loosely, \"Lucife r\" oo-Ri-El --- (The initial Aleph is silent --- no \"a\" sound here) oo as in moon. i as in police. e as in bet. Acce nt the last two syllables. By now, the reader has had a chance to try these pronunciations, and is just possibly a bi t discouraged. Actually, once a start has been made at book-taught pronunciation of Hebrew, t he worst is over. Now, but not when you made your first attempt, there are a few simple tricks to getting the sounds put together right. First, do each syllable separately, a s though they were distinct words. Second, try the accent by making the unaccented syllable words more quiet and the accent syllable word louder. Finally, build fluency by saying the entire word as a smooth s ound instead of distinct syllables. Pick an English word to get the feel of this final stage . Take an English Dictionary, and practice putting words you already use together by the pronuncia tion guide just after the first listing of the word in the dictionary. You will find yourself m aking the same natural errors in accent and fluency with these common words that you are making with H ebrew. The \"feel\" of the clumsiness of the pronunciation is the same for English as it is f or Hebrew. Likewise the \"feel\" of a well pronounced word is the same. Example: Take the English word: \" Success\". A good dictionary will write: \"(s*k-ses')\"...\"*\" will be an upsidedown \"e\". The front of the dictionary will explain the sounds made by things like the upsidedown \"e\" symbol and the other sound symbols. The apostrophe (') symbol comes just after the accented syllable (I ha ve used an underline here instead). Pretend that you have never used the word before and try it. If it come s out: Suck- ces, you will be able to hear yourself enough to see how to make the word sound more corre ct. Work on the Hebrew until it \"hears\" like English to you. There is one more trick to this that is a bit harder, but which works for some people. If you are not sure of several mi nor differences in pronunciation for a given word, simply try to say them all at the same instant. The resulting stress produces an odd twisting in the mouth and can more closely duplicate natural speech sounds than any purely academic methods can possibly manage. ---- O'h y es, CROWLEY is pronounced Crow-lee, not Craughli!
