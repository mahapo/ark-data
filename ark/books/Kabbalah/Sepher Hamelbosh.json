[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" 1 BOOK OF THE VESTMENT [S EPHER HA MELBOSH] IT IS DECREED, THE HOLY AND PURE ARE FILLED with secret wisdom [Rezi Chokmah]. The knowledge is the result of understanding. The wise are humble and cry in joy from the names learned in clear language. The chosen a re pure of heart. Make to heal the body. Give grace that measures the strength of the light of the shin ing star. Gird with the strength. The power is established forever by the actions before the generations. Rejoice in silence from genera - don to generati on of the holy heights [Qedoshov Merom]. It is written as pure gold. A bubbling fountain of purity is established in the center of the sublime power. Of the works of glory, the most precious pearls are not compared with the glory, nor the finest gold of Ap hier. 1 The value of wisdom cannot be measured, nor un derstanding of knowledge. Also, there is no measure to the value of the secrets written herein, as revealed by Elohim. As the force of fire, all search therein. As the ruler of the heavens, all search t herein. The Tree of Life is supported and guarded and protected, as the apple of the eye. By reverence of the Lord, the glory is obtained. Obtain the glory to obtain life. Of understanding, receive wisdom. Of salvation, keep from death. Of fulfillment of t he Nephesh, by consecration. Of the power, be strengthened by rever ence of the Lord. Of learning the knowledge, understand and fill the heart with wisdom. From drawing of life, increase from the sole to the heel. Form divisions in the Garden of Eden. Eloh im treasures the reverence. The Lord fills all the Earth with glory, as in heaven where the throne is established. There is no measure to the glory. Seven fountains rise and fall to honor a thou sand thousands ministers [Mesharethim] and a myriad myriads h osts [Tzebavoth] . 2 The force of fire ignites the river of fire flowing forth. The sound shakes the nations in fear of destruction. A vison comes forth of the image of a fiery archer as Tharshish and Sar donyx, and arrows as swift as lightning. 3 The throne of the glory resembles ice [crystal]. Surrounded by Malachim, the archer Ophan kindles the flames. 4 The people of the dominion tremble in fear and cover their eyes. The Lord made clouds and fog all around, wrapped in swaddling cloth, dwelling alone upon t he throne, concealed and hidden. The worthy go forth to the hidden light. The most profound se crets are revealed. The revelations are made clear, not obscured by darkness. There is nothing in all the universe that compares. All ac tions and desires are fu lfilled by works revealed. Become proficient and results occur quickly. Those who attempt to duplicate the works receive no results. The souls [Nepheshoth] of the disobedi ent and rebellious are punished by condemnation. By desire, to es tablish the curse. The sea dries up. The Sun and Moon darken. The light of the stars becomes faint. The mountains shift and fall, and the Earth trembles. This is the result of arrogance. Those cho sen are strengthened by the power of the wisdom, established by understanding the knowledge. In the holy book are 72 signs, given by Michael, the great prince above seven princes, ministering before the king, king of kings [Melech Melechi Melechim]. From it, Adam, the first man, re ceived the beginning wisdom. From it, awaken and p roclaim the names of every living creature and bird and creeping thing and fish. From understanding, increase the wisdom of all created by Elohim on the sixth day of Genesis [Berashith]. 1 A city or province famous for the highest quality of gold. 2 Ten million. A myriad equals ten thousand. 3 Tharshish is a semiprecious stone from the Spanish kingdom of the same name. Some suggest it is either amber or chrysolite. It is also the name of the ruling angel of the angelic order of Tharshishiem. 4 In Gustav D avidson, Dictionary of Angels (New York: Free Press, 1967, p. 213), it is noted that Ophan is identified by the ancient sages as the angel Sandalphon, the twin brother of Metatron.

He knew the words were true. The knowledge lifted him above all other creatures. He was in awe from all he saw therein, and under stood that all that is written in the book is the truth. 5 It is true; all of the words in the book are most holy. Great i s the glory of every power. In holiness and purity, perform the operations. In humility and modesty, succeed in all works. Become wise by the spirit of wisdom [Ruoch Chokmah]. It is written, Adam prepared a bar of gold and purified it twice by fire. Then [ he] engraved thereupon the signs of the holy book, in holiness and purity. Then [he] placed the book in a cleft of the rock on the east side of the Garden of Eden â€” not to fall to Earth, but to endure and sustain the power. In every place, Adam was sustained . It is proclaimed, Adam wandered upon the earth, as a ship upon the sea. He remembered and recorded when mountains melted like wax; and the sea went forth as hoar frost; and fire went forth as dust; and lions and leopards and bears and animals of the past ure stood silent and still; and insects rose up in the air as birds; and the sea became a desert wilderness. 6 He remembered and recorded the letters of the holy name be fore the Sun and the Moon and Orion [Hakesil]. By the light of all luminaries, rule in righteousness and in reverence of Elohim. Also, hold dominion over the spirit [Ruoch] and over violence [Shad] and over misfortune [Phega'a, or enemy] and adversaries [Shatan] rising up over men and women. It is written, be summoned as you wish and desire. He recorded when the stone wall of the tower suddenly fell to the ground; and fruit trees bear fruit before the proper time; and [people] take flight before battles of war. Everything was revealed to him: of the holy spirit [Ruoch Hakadesh], of death and life, of goodness and evil. Also, the mys teries of hours and minutes of time, and number of days. Calculate the seasons and anniversaries [Yobelim, refers to the equinoxes and solstices] until the end of the universe. Measure the time from the beginning u ntil the end. Then serve his son, Seth. 7 For ten years, instructed according to the way of the holy book, he received understanding of all letters and words engraved in the holy book, of all powers revealed. He knew by the powers therein to perform miracle s, and learned to perform the works. He kept the book hidden away in the cleft of a rock. From the book, Adam learned that the time of death drew near. Every day, he rejoiced in adjuration, not eating fruits or vegetables or any meat [giving] forth blood. Every day, [he bathed] in the pu rity of running water, once in the morning and once in the evening. He spoke to his son, Seth, by adjuration alone, not guided by the holy spirit. Preparation is difficult. Work only in humility and reverance, in purity and holiness. Every path is revealed and you become wise by the signs. After all this, Adam was released to the long home [Beth A'ao - lam, a reference to the cemetery or grave]. His son, Seth, served the Lord. He was sustained therein by every power, not turni ng to the left and right from every word spoken by his father, Adam. He became wise from understanding the knowledge, and received the wisdom of the holy book. He opened the gate of wisdom and un derstanding. Know the difference between good and evil, be r e pelled by evil and choose goodness. See and behold the generations of ancestors coming after. The foolish and the vain and the sinful profane by proclaiming false idols in the name of God. The disobedient and rebellious tolerate suffering, not knowing or understanding. Journey in darkness. Seth became wise by the secrets of the book and the letters of the holy name engraved therein. He learned that God would cause the sea to overflow and destroy all the world by his power. He kept the book in a vault of g old and also placed in the vault all the pre cious spices, and kept it hidden in a cave. He lived in the city of Enoch, built by his brother Cain [see Genesis 4:17]. 5 Psalms 119:160. 'The beginning of your word is Truth.\" 6 These are omens and portents, probably noted to help predict weather. 7 Seth was Adam's third son, after Cain and Abel. See Genesis 5:3.
