Members of lodges were for the most part statesmen, aristocrats and intellec- tuals: dignitaries, career soldiers, officials, writers and scientists, churchmen, etc. Masonic views are known to have had a considerable influence on the ideology of that time but, although the history of Russian masonry has been well studied 2 , masonic ideology has until now received little scholarly atten- tion. T here is a long tradition in Russian science of scepticism concerning the main constituents of masonic tradition: mysticism, alchemy and Kabbalah. During the late 19 th – early twentieth centuries, Russian scholars paid little at- tention to this topic, mainly because of their extreme positivistic views. In the Soviet period, the topic was taboo. Moreover, there are a number of objective difficulties in studying masonic teachings. Most masonic texts have not yet been published. Significant parts of masonic documents were destroyed by the masons themselves, or were lost as a result of government persecution. In addition, the masons themselves of- ten masked their involvement in Kabbalah and alchemy 3 . Thus the available materials are scarce and often encrypted.

It is suggested that the ca. 150 masonic lodges of the Catherinian age contained no less than 8000 members (A. I. Serkov, personal communication).

In a thorough investigation of manuscripts in Moscow archives 4 we discov- ered dozens of texts related to Kabbalah, including both translations from dif- ferent languages (probably including Hebrew) and original compositions. This paper is an analysis of the kabbalistic constituent of masonic teaching. Special attention is paid here to individuals interested in Jewish mysticism; we describe some Russian masons who have read, translated and used in their practical life not only the texts of the Christian kabbalists but also original Jewish writings. In addition, we attempted to find possible intermediaries who participated in transmission of this knowledge to their Russian masonic broth- ers. In our view , the question of the role of Kabbalah in masonic tradition is extremely important 5 . Below we try to describe the kabbalistic concepts which were especially interesting to Russian masons and contributed greatly to their social and political thinking. Historical introduction Three main periods are normally discerned in the history of Russian freema- sonry during the 18 th century . In the first, from the 1740s to the enthronement of Catherine the Great in 1762, freemasonry was ‘ merely a fashionable thing borrowed from the W est without any criticism’ . In the second period, which lasted up to the early 1780s, freemasonry was ‘ the first moral philosophy in Russia; three first degrees of “ St. Jones” , or “ symbolic” freemasonry pre- vailed’ 6 . The third period, when the “ higher degrees” , especially the Rosicrucians, dominated in Russia, covers the 1780s 7 . The government per- 4 We refer mostly to the MS documents which are contained in the Division of Manuscripts (DMS) of the Russian State Library (RSL), in the Russian State Archive of Ancient Acts (RSAAA), and in the Russian State Historical Archive of Moscow (RSHAM). For further details, see: Burmistrov and Endel, ‘ Kabbalah in Russian Masonry’ ; Burmistrov, ‘ Kabbalistic Exegetics and Christian Dogmatics’ . 5 By “ Masonic tradition” we have in mind a complex system of theological, philosophical and mystical ideas which penetrated masonic teaching, propagated among the masons according to their rules and traditions, and was used in practice when carrying out masonic works. Thus this notion includes not only a set of concepts but also a specific system of their treating, learning and interpretation. For a review of the Russian mason’ s practices, see Smith, Working the Rough Stone , 30-52. 6 That is these lodges comprised only three Masonic degrees, accepted in the Craft from the very beginning: Pupil, Apprentice and Master. 7 See Semeka, ‘ Russian Masonry in the Eighteenth Century’ , 125."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"KABBALAH AND RUSSIAN FREEMASONS 29 secutions in the early 1790s put an end to the expansion of freemasonry . The masons began to recover gradually their activity only after the death of Catherine II and the enthronement of Paul I. This process continued at the early 19 th century , up to 1822 when Alexander I prohibited every freemasonic activity in Russian. Two principal trends may be identified in Russian freemasonry of the late 18 th –early 19 th centuries: rationalistic (deistic) and mystical. The trends were strongly interrelated. Rationalistic freemasonry reached its acme in the 1760s- 70s. In their outlook, literary preferences, social and political views, these masons were almost identical with Russian V oltaireans 8 , zealous supporters of the ideas of Enlightenment, natural law and physiocratism. Encouraged by the “ enlightened” Empress Catherine II, Russian V oltaireans sought to elaborate a new morality based on reason but not on Christian ethics 9 . To create this new morality , it was necessary , however, to establish a tightly-knit secret organiza- tion for, in V oltaire’ s view, to allow common people to reason tended to result in destroying the whole job. In the 1770s the centres of the novel “ religion of reason” became lodges of the first Russian masonic union in St. Petersburg, headed by Ivan P . Elagin (1725-1793) 10 . These lodges were characterized by weak discipline and liberalism. It is obvious that any interest in mystical mat- ters in such a milieu was next to impossible. Curiously, the leader of the ma- sonic union, Elagin, studied kabbalistic teachings and used them in his own writings. At first, he was also a V oltaire enthusiast but later, having “ recov- ered” from V oltairianism, he broke away from rationalistic freemasonry 11 . The second trend in Russian freemasonry of the 18 th century, the “ mystical” masons, involved stronger discipline in the lodges and unconditional submis- 8 Vernadsky, Russian Masonry in the Reign of Catherine the Great , 500, noted that properly speaking ‘ Masonic lodges of the 1770s were V oltairian institutions’ . 9 On the Russian V oltairian movement, see Mikhailov and Stroiev (eds.), V oltaire and Russia ; Karp, French Enlighteners and Russia . 10 On the relationship between Russian Masons and V oltairians, see also V ernadsky, Russian Masonry in the Reign of Catherine the Great , 140-56 (Ch. 2, Pt. 2: ‘ Masonry and V oltairianism’ ); Semeka, ‘ Russian Masonry in the Eighteenth century’ , 132-49. 11 Elagin wrote later: ‘ I was attracted by godless writers who converted Christian faith into blasphemy and Holy Scriptures into mockery, scoffs, and sneer [... ] I became acquainted with atheists and deists [... ] Boulanger [... ] V oltaire, Rousseau, Helvetius [... ] This reading cor- rupted my soul [... ] and misled me [... ] But the Actual Grace did not want my complete perdi- tion; it did allow neither to V oltaire’ s writings nor to those of other so-called new philosophers and encyclopaedists to convert my soul entirely [to their faith]’ . See Novikov, Freemasonry and Russian Culture , 228– 29. A similarly critical attitude to V oltairianism was evinced by the head of Moscow “ mystical” masons, Professor Johann Schwarz, and masonic activists such as Ivan Lopukhin and Aleksey Kutuzov.

Two great masonic systems are discernible within this trend. The first was the so-called “ Knighthood” , a masonic union of the Swed- ish system with “ Capitulum Phoenix” at the head, founded in the late 1770s 12 . Splendid rituals were typical of this freemasonry; its members belonged mostly to the high life. The Grand Prefect of the Capitulum and the Grand Master of the Great National Lodge (Swedish system) was Prince G .P . Gagarin (1745– 1808), and their Grand Secretary was one of the most authoritative Russian masons I.V . Beber (1746– 1820) 13 . The Swedish lodges in Russia con- sisted mostly of noblemen who were strongly involved in political intrigues and had only little interest in mystical matters. Their leadership, “ Capitulum Phoenix” , comprised, however, devoted mystics and theosophers. They stud- ied Kabbalah, magic and alchemy , founded secret “ theoretical” lodges, and dreamed of being members of an “ invisible universal Capitulum” which, as they believed, governed all the world 14 . Working in the deepest secrecy (most of its members were unknown to the government and even to the ordinary masons), “ Capitulum Phoenix” strongly affected almost all masonic activity in Russia in the late 18 th –early 19 th centuries. At the same time, in the 1780s, the teaching of the Order of Gold and Rosy Cross came to Russia from Germany and became the second movement of Russian “ mystical” freemasonry . Let us briefly consider the history of this Or- der. T he Order of Gold and Rosy Cross emerged in Germany in the mid-1750s. There are several versions of its appearance. The Rosicrucians themselves be- lieved that the Order had been a successor of the ancient Rosicrucian tradition which arose in the fourteenth century and was manifested openly in the early seventeenth century (in turn, they claimed that this tradition descended from the Primordial doctrine, granted to Adam) 15 . In the early 18 th century , there ap- peared some writings on the teaching and main structural principles of a Rosicrucian Order. In 1710 Samuel Richter, a Silesian minister, published a 12 See Sokolovskaia, Capitilum Phoenix . 13 Born in Weimar, Beber was a Lutheran; he taught physics and mathematics in the higher schools at St. Petersburg, and was a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Beber had a passion for numerology, Kabbalah, and Swedenborg’ s teaching. He possessed a rich collection of books and manuscripts on the secret sciences.

Under the influence of freemasonry in the mid-18 th century, an explosion of Rosicrucian groups and circles in Germany and Austria occurred. Numerous Rosicrucian centres were scattered throughout southern Germany, Austria, Hungary and northern Italy . In Germany , “ new” Rosicrucians “ debuted” first in Sulzbach, in 1755-56; then the centre of their activity moved to Berlin 17 . Among the leaders of the movement were Bernhard J. Schleiss von Lö wenfeld, Johann G . Schrepfer, Friedrich J. W . Schrö der and Johann Ch. von Wö llner. These were the real creators of the famous secret organization known as the Order of the Gold- and Rosy Cross. The Order was founded by Bernhard Joseph Schleiss von Lö wenfeld (1731-1800) , a physician to the ducal house at Sulzbach who later received an earlship and became a councilor of the duke 18 . He took an obvious interest in Kabbalah as if following the traditions of the Sulzbach Christian Kabbalah of the late seventeenth century . Curiously, in the last quarter of the seventeenth century, Sulzbach had become a centre of Christian kabbalistic studies. Under the aegis of Prince Christian-August (1622-1702) , the Duke of Sulzbach, lived and worked Christian Knorr von Rosenroth (1636-89), known for his transla- tions of kabbalistic texts and the compiler of the anthology Kabbala Denudata 19 . It is no wonder that several decades later Schleiss reproduced the ideas of Knorr, Francis Mercury van Helmont (1614-98), and other Christian kabba- lists of that group, and taught in his own writings how to regain a true spiritual teaching, the “ authentic Kabbalah” , from the alphabet of Nature. The most important concepts of the Order had their source in Kabbalah: the idea on the 16 Sincerus Renatus [S.

Jewish elements played an important role in Rosicrucian rituals 24 . It is noteworthy that all the abovementioned kabbalistic ideas adopted by this Order were later incorporated by the Russian masons 25 . The ultimate goal of the Order is described as follows: ‘ To awake hidden forces of nature, to liberate the natural light which was deeply buried under the dross after the damnation, and to kindle in every brother a burning torch that would help him to see easy the concealed God [... ] and thus to join more closely to the primeval Source of Light’ 26 . The history of the Order was described in detail in the book The Compass of Wisemen , which was extremely popular in the masonic milieu 27 . The book 20 Sefirah (Heb., pl. Sefirot ) – literally “ number” . The concept of Sefirot has the central place in the theosophy of Jewish Kabbalah. Sefirot are conceived as ten stages of emanation from Ein- Sof , the Infinite, God Himself. Each Sefirah denotes a certain aspect of God as a Creator. The ten Sefirot together form the Tree of Sefirot, the universal structure of the whole creation. This Tree is considered a dynamic unity where the Divine manifestation is unfolded. At the same time, they are ten attributes of the Creator: 1. Keter (“ Crown” ); 2. Hokhmah (“ Wisdom” ); 3. Binah (“ Intelligence” ); 4. Gedullah (“ Greatness” ), or Hesed (“ Love” , “ Charity” ); 5.

The author was apparently Johann Christoph von Wö llner (1732-1800) 28 , one of the greatest German masons and an ideologist of the Order. A set of right-wing political and religious thinkers belonging to the German intellectual establishment gathered around Wö llner, who was known for his ultra-conserva tive religious views. In the 1780s the Rosicrucians gained considerable influence at the Prussian court. One of their leaders, Johann Rudolph von Bischofswerder (1741-1803) , convinced Prince Friedrich-Wilhelm (1744-1797) , the Prussian heir apparent, to join the Order and in 1781 Friedrich-Wilhelm became a member (his Order name was Ormesus Magnus). Following his enthronement, the Rosicrucians began to make internal and external policy in Prussia; Wö llner and Bischofs- werder were appointed to ministerial posts and became intimate advisors of Friedrich-Wilhel m. Wö llner, the head of the Department of religious affairs, established a religious censorship, “ Immediat-Examin ations-Kommission” , a kind of Lutheran inquisition (1791), and persecutions of the enlighteners be- gan. The political power of the Order in Prussia came to end in 1797, follow- ing the death of Friedrich-Wilhe lm II. In the south too, the Order was suppressed. After interdiction of alchemy in Austria (1785), it continued to work illegally. In 1790 it again rose to the surface for a while, under Leopold II (1747-1792) , the Holy Roman Emperor from 1790 to 1792. He was one of the most capable of the 18 th -century reform- ist rulers known as the “ enlightened despots” and took a deep interest in al- chemy and Kabbalah. Following his death in 1792 the new emperor, Francis II (1768-1835) , banned the Order once again 29 . Wö llner, as well as Johann Ch. A. T heden (1714-1797) , and their envoy in Moscow , Baron Heinrich-Jacob Schrö der (1757-c.1797 ) 30 , were the chiefs of the Moscow Brothers and the main source of masonic information and mysti- cal literature. Russian masons had already known about the Rosicrucians in the mid-1770s 31 ; the Order began to act in Russia, however, only after Johann V ersammlungsreden der Gold- und Rosenkreutzer des alten Systems (Russian translations was published in the secret Masonic typography, Moscow, 1784). 28 See Schuster, Secret Societies, Unions and Orders , V ol. 2, 64.

He received from them an appointment as ‘ the only Supreme Director’ of the Rosicrucian Order in the Russian Empire, acts of the “ Theoretic Degree” 32 and permission to begin the work in Moscow 33 . The influence of the Order was so great that after 1780s two parallel and almost independent trends existed in Russian freemasonry: the traditional masons and the Rosicrucians 34 . The strongest interest in Jewish Kabbalah was manifested among the Russian Rosicrucians. The centre of their activity was the Moscow circle of Johann Schwarz and Nikolay I. Novikov (1744-1818) . Having revised the ideas of ancient and medieval Christian mys- tics, alchemists, Christian kabbalists as well as European mystics of the 17 th – 18 th centuries, they elaborated their own doctrine. Their social and political views were imbued with conservatism and religious enthusiasm. Inspired by the ideas of Louis-Claude de Saint Martin (1743-1803) 35 and German Rosicrucians, they considered religion and the masonic movement instruments to preserve the political system and social stability . They pondered over an ideal masonic state ruled by a mystical Order, under the sovereignty of the “ Holy King” . The Rosicrucians approached the conservative party of Counts Nikita I. Panin (1718-1783) and Peter I. Panin (1721-1789) seeking contacts with Crown Prince Paul (in their view , the putative future “ Holy King” ) 36 . This activity resulted in persecution of Russian masons, who fell into disgrace with the government in the late 1780s-early 1790s. Below we concentrate only on masonic circles whose members were deeply involved in studying theoretical facets of European mysticism, al- chemy and Kabbalah and who sought to embody their knowledge in their own compositions, in their practices of God-knowing, mystical contemplation and praying.

They were a minority in Russian masonry (about 2- 3%) but had a great authority and influence. There is almost no evidence con- cerning any interest for Kabbalah in the main masonic Rites working in Russia in the late 18 th - early 19 th centuries: Ecossais Rectifeé , Strikt- and Laxe- Observanz, the Templers, etc. The structure of masonry in Russia was rather flexible: some lodges and unions could fiercely fight with each other but after a while they united together (as it happened in the 1770s with Elagin’ s English union and Reuchel’ s Swedish-Berlin lodges). Besides, the same masons are known to have belonged to several Rites simultaneously and even to have held there the leading offices. The doctrines of Western masonry were perceived by the Russian Brothers with great criticism. Therefore it is difficult to define the things they truly believed when analyzing official documents of this or that masonic system they belonged to. In our opinion, the interest in Kabbalah and other secret sciences in Russian masonry was characteristic not for certain Rites, Orders and Degrees, but for the individual spiritual and intellectual quest of some Russian mystics. For example, among the main enthusiasts of Kabbalah was Ivan Elagin, the chief of the first masonic English union in Rus- sia (see below), but his lodges did not deal with Kabbalah and other occult teachings at all. It is also important to emphasize the strong influence exerted to the mystical strivings of the Russian masons by Russian Orthodoxy . Most of the Russian Rosicrucians and “ theoretic” masons were true Orthodox Chris- tians well-read in patristic literature. The Byzantine and Russian Orthodox spiritual traditions (St. (Pseudo)-Dionysi us Areopagita, St. Maximus the Con- fessor, St. Simeon the New Theologian, St. Gregory Palamas) which were ex- tremely important for them, define to a great extent the originality of their masonic views. It is necessary also to discriminate masonic documents such as statutes, theoretic manuals, catechisms, etc. from manifold writings which comprised the “ circle of reading” of the Russian masons (a great bulk of translated and original texts including patristic literature, books of Catholic and Protestant mystics, pietists, theosophers, alchemists, and some treatises on historiosophy and theology written by the Russian Brothers). In masonic documents as such, it is hardly possible to find any references to Kabbalah; even if this term is used there it has only a “ metaphorical” sense. 37 On the contrary , the “ circle of 37 See on this “ metaphorical” Kabbalah Kilcher’ s Die Sprachtheorie der Kabbala als ä sthetisches Paradigma."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"36 KONSTANTIN BURMISTROV & MARIA ENDEL masonic reading” contains dozens of texts relating to Christian and Jewish Kabbalah (see below). Thus we can treat the kabbalistic interests of some Russian masons not as a peculiar “ intramasonic” phenomenon caused by their European mentors but as an original trend in the history of Russian thought that emerged due to a number of different factors. The spiritual image of Russian masons First, we try to present a brief description of the spiritual image of those who felt themselves to be members of the Rosicrucian Order. Their Weltan- schauung is commonly considered as a reaction to V oltairianism, and as a Rus- sian phenomenon of the 18 th century , the so-called “ freethinking” 38 . In a broader context, however, their views may be regarded as an attempt to over- come the deep religious and intellectual crisis suffered by Russian society in the 18 th century. As was noted by G . Florovsky , the Russian theologian, ‘ All the historic importance of the Russian freemasonry resided in the fact that it repre- sented psychological ascesis and reintegration of the [Russian] soul. In free- masonry, the Russian soul goes back to itself after a long period of dissipation [... ] This was spiritual awakening from a dead faint’ 39 . In the last quarter of the 18 th century , a specific “ mystical” sub-culture, with a definite set of stereotypes and symbols and an inevitable taint of mystery and feeling of selectivity, was developing. An extremely intensive spiritual life fo- cused on a continuous search for the true path, with all its doubts and disap- pointments, was typical of those who belonged to this subculture 40 . Russian masons were eclectic in what they read and in their religious exercises; it is difficult to imagine how they could combine Orthodox piety with alchemic works and kabbalistic practice. In all their doings, we feel an enormous and astonishingly forceful longing for a faith-cure of the world and for the trans- figuration of man. This should explain the highly active social position of many masons dur- ing the age of Catherine the Great.

V ery typical of Russian masons was charity work, such as free distribution of bread in meagre years, establishment of a number of free homes and public schools throughout Russia, rendering assistance to poor brothers, etc. Furthermore, Moscow ma- sons were seriously occupied with pedagogical activity. Thus they played an important role in the establishment of Moscow University and a number of scientific and student organizations. The development of Russian theatre, of the pharmacy in Russia etc. also are linked to the names of outstanding ma- sons. Many of them held high positions in state and military services. It is noteworthy that they were concerned not only with the best organization of society and nature as a whole but also with their own farming and agronomy; thus they nursed their estates, and their mystical experience correlated well with their economic activity. Moscow Rosicrucians were also deeply involved in political activities; the well-known official persecutions of Russian masons in the 1790s were caused by suspicions that they had plotted a take-over. Behind this social activity was a fundamental concept of the world and the human race, reflecting a masonic version, rooted in gnosticism, of the biblical myth of the fall of man. Masons collected ideas and concepts coherent with this basic view within various philosophic and religious systems. An important element of their search was Kabbalah. The main sources of knowledge in the field were original kabbalis- tic texts and those of Christian kabbalists. Some works of Protestant mystics and pietists of the seventeenth century also served as important sources. In turn, Protestant mystical concepts of universal salvation and readjustment of the world can be traced back to the doctrine of Tikkun ha-olam in the Lurianic Kabbalah 41 . In addition, a number of transformed kabbalistic ideas were bor- rowed from European mystics of the 18 th century such as E. Swedenborg, F. Oetinger, L.-C. de Saint-Martin; some Russian masons were known to be ac- quainted with them personally . 41 This kabbalistic school was established by Isaak Luria (Ha-Ari) in Safed in the 1570s. On the influence of Lurianic doctrine on European mysticism see: Coudert, The Impact of the Kabbalah in the Seventeenth Century , esp. 120-132; Burmistrov, ‘ Kabbala Denudata Redis- covered’ ; id. ‘ Kabbalah in European Culture’ . Tikkun ha-olam (Heb., “ Improvement of the Uni- verse” ) – in Lurianic Kabbalah, the process of universal restoration and redintegration of the primeval harmony, destroyed by the general cataclasm of the “ breaking of vessels” ( shevirat ha- kelim ). A special task in tikkun is entrusted to man who is to make the improvement of the lowest regions of the universe and to liberate the sparks of light imprisoned there by means of his personal illumination and cleaving to the Holy One.

At the first stage, it teaches him to possess the light of the perennial, supernal Being, Adam Kadmon , and he should strive toward His perfection. At the second stage, it offers him the integrated image of the kabbalistic world of ten Sefirot and four Olamot 42 . This is especially important at the third stage when Kabbalah be- comes necessary for understanding the “ spiritual language” of the Scriptures and this by use of Kabbalistic hermeneutics. It is not strange that precisely the rules and methods of kabbalistic hermeneutics were so important for Russian masons; we can find their description in almost all masonic manuscripts de- voted to kabbalistic matters. Notwithstanding all the differences and the diversity of the masonic sys- tems, one may discern some basic concepts, or models, of comprehension un- derlying the masonic Weltanschauung, or, more strictly , of masonic epistemol- ogy which determines, to a great extent, the masonic outlook. The attitude was formulated in brief by N. I. Novikov in his ‘ Notice to readers’ in the masonic magazine V echerniaia zaria (1782). Speaking about the aims of his new maga- zine, he writes: When the wise Creator of the universe made the visible world, to give light upon it, He fastened on the firmament countless number of glittering lights. Within the small world, i.e. man, for enlightening his ways, He fired the light of mind which was so great at the beginning that there was no secret so deep that he could not penetrate it. But not for long could man use this light; he appropriated it, and reflected back the Divine beams, and became gloomy. Darkness covered his pre- vious enlightenment 43 . In fact, the concept of the perennial man, Adam Kadmon, his Fall and his Return, is the very heart of the masonic system. It is precisely this idea which underlies their doctrine of the primordial unity of mankind which has been destroyed and is to be repaired. The mason himself is likened here to Adam, that is to one who has possessed, from the very beginning, numerous virtues and true knowledge. This symbol is very important for masonic myth. It is highly syncretic: it includes elements drawn from biblical, apocryphal, her- metic, Gnostic, Christian and kabbalistic texts. The teaching about two Adams plays a special role here. The first Adam has the features of Adam before the Fall , with the universalism of Adam Kadmon, the perennial supernal being in 42 On these kabbalistic concepts see Scholem, Kabbalah , 96-116. 43 (Anon.), ‘ To the readers’ , V echernyaya Zarya ( Evening Glow ) 1 (1782), 2."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"KABBALAH AND RUSSIAN FREEMASONS 39 whose image man and the world were created and whose soul contained souls of all people, and of perennial Jesus-Messiah . The second Adam, or Jesus incarnated, is considered a manifestation, or Hieroglyph, of the first Adam 44 . The writings of Russian masons belong to a Christian (probably heterodox) tradition, but Adam Kadmon is interpreted here in accordance with kabbalistic views. Thus in discussing the problem of the manifest and non-manifest God, an author notes: In order to make these emanations and images of Divine features and powers, the infinite Primitive Cause, infinite Spirit or infinite Light emanated [from itself] the fundamental First Principle through which come further emanations. It is Adam Kadmon , i.e. archetypal perennial Man ( Urmensch ). This first-begotten Lord’ s [Son] was revealed in ten kinds of emanation, or in ten images, and pro- duced outwardly the same number of sources of lights: they are called Sefirot , Sefirs, primordial figures, figures of things ( Urzahlen ) 45 . For masonic myth, the concept of the Fall which was identical with the loss of wisdom, perennial Knowledge, and Light by Adam, is of extreme importance. All masonic activity is aimed at restoring this lost wisdom. Like Christian kab- balists of the fifteenth– sixteenth centuries, the Russian masons often consid- ered Kabbalah the perennial knowledge granted to Adam in Eden. For exam- ple, in the same masonic text one may read: The kabbalists say that God declared this secret knowledge to Adam, but Adam, because of his fall, tore away from the Kingdom of God and the Lord’ s Anointed, and because of this he lost this wisdom, realized the importance of his loss, again returned to the source of felicity, and passed this truth on to his posterity. There is nothing here that we could not accept. But in Kabbalah (excluding many addi- tions filled with lies), this is expressed in the language of images. Kingdom ( Kö nigreich = Malchut ) here is the most inferior Sefirot [i.e. Sefirah ] in which is concentrated the light of all the Sefirot emanated from the infinite Source of Light through Archetypal Man ( Urmensch = Adam Kadmon = Son of God). By its Almighty Power, It [i.e. Light] leads man and all the creatures out to their Beati- tude. Inasmuch as Adam had a desire to be his own lord for himself, or to be equal to God, he tore away this Sefirot [i.e. Sefirah ], i.e. the Kingdom of God, and together with it tore away the Leaf, or the Twig from the Tree of Sefirot (tore away Nature from the influence of the Heavenly Light), and after that he was covered with shame by the sensation of the death that he attracted to himself by his tearing away from the Tree of Life and from the Light which is the Heavenly Man 46 . It is suggested that one may attain great wisdom due to the process of self- knowledge; this is considered to be the cognition of both Nature and the Crea- 44 See Saint Martin, On Errors and Truth , 35, 70. 45 DMS RSL, F . 14, N 992 (‘ A Short Notion on Kabbalah’ , the early 19th century), f. 14-14r. 46 DMS RSL, F . 14, N 992, f. 3r-4."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"40 KONSTANTIN BURMISTROV & MARIA ENDEL tor, because of the isomorphism of the macrocosm (“ the universe” ) and mi- crocosm (“ the small world” , “ man” ). As it is said in a masonic song, ‘ While trying Nature in myself, / the Creation and the Creator shall I comprehend; / striving to penetrate into myself, / I can know Him by my soul’ 47 . Florovsky notes reasonably that ‘ dogmatically freemasonry was, in es- sence, a revival of Neoplatonic and Gnostic doctrines, renewed since the Ren- aissance. The most important thing was the idea of the Fall, “ a spark of light” captured by the darkness. Not so much a strong feeling of sin as a sensation of impurity was typical of the masons. And it is resolved not so much by penance as by abstinence’ 48 . It is interesting that self-knowledge, at least in its first stage, presupposes that the man involved is frightened by his sins and chooses the way of im- provement. Masonic mystical knowledge, mystical illumination, up to the un- ion with the Godhead, is possible only for ‘ bearers of spirit’ who, by way of moral self-correctio n, ‘ developed in themselves abilities that, after their full revelation, raise him up to the lower regions of the realm of angels’ 49 . Preach- ing about personal self-perfection and mysticism are tightly connected here with each other, ‘ for the truth is a mystery that may be revealed not by mental efforts but by moral great deeds of the will [... ] one can know everything only by overcoming the sinfulness of human nature’ 50 and with the attainment of the knowledge and light that were lost by the first man, Adam. As mentioned above, Adam is an archetype for the mason, who is sinful, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, has the opportunity to return to the previous sinless and perfect condition. This condition can be attained after numerous trials whose first preparatory stage is moral self-correction. Also we are not deprived of this light, it is present within us, but it is obscured and suppressed by our wicked deeds. It shines also in Nature but as it does not shine within ourselves we could not see it outside. And so the true sages of the ancient and modern times declare self-knowledge the first exercise of the man [... ] Self-knowledge ought to begin with perception and improvement of our moral acts, and after that we can learn the intrinsic mysteries of human nature 51 . In fact, at the next stage, ‘ when our spirit is prepared in such a way , and the light within us is unveiled, then we can put our attention to the external things or the nature, and to recognize the great perfection, skills, and the greatness of 47 Published in: Magazin svobodno-kamensh chicheskiy ( Free-Masonic Magazine ) 1:1, 142. 48 Florovsky, Paths of Russian Theology , 119. 49 Kiesewetter, ‘ Moscow Rosicrucians of the Eighteenth Century’ , 116. 50 Ibid., 117. 51 (Anon.), ‘ To the readers’ , 3."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"KABBALAH AND RUSSIAN FREEMASONS 41 its Architect in its marvelous construction. Finally , who desires to see the great wisdom in its full brightness, let him start to read Holy Writ ardently and zeal- ously; he will find there all the mysteries of the Divine and Natural explained by the spiritual language’ 52 . Therefore the masonic theory of knowledge requires the initiate to pass through three stages. In the first stage, he is occupied with moral self-correc- tion and knowing the mysteries intrinsic to man. In the second stage, he must come to know Nature. In the third stage, the mysteries of Nature and God are understood at a higher level using the “ spiritual language” of the Scriptures 53 . This three-stage path is considered the return to that time when ‘ the book of nature was opened for human understanding, and man could comprehend all its mysteries by his mind’ 54 . This return is possible, however, due to mastering the knowledge Adam possessed in Paradise. The masons believe that after his fall he kept everything in his memory [... ] and through his memory , he taught his de- scendants the sciences that he had known in Eden about nature and its Ruler. Afterwards, some of them kept these teachings of wisdom and transmitted them by word of mouth to the next generation [... ] One may claim with great confi- dence that the teachings of our forefathers were transmitted to posterity with great accuracy [... ] However because of the multiplication of the human race over the surface of the Earth, and their dissemination throughout the world, the precepts about knowledge and truth taken from the First Man were transformed into fallacies [... ] that is why they have been kept in all their previous power and perfection in but a few people 55 . Thus, an ancient and authentic tradition was necessary to save this knowledge. When Russian masons travelled throughout Europe, studying the works of Western mystics, alchemists and Christian kabbalists, masonic and Rosi- crucian documents, they sought just this tradition. In this way , they had the greatest respect for Kabbalah. 52 Ibid., 3-4. 53 Similar reasoning can be find in several MSs for example in Besedi iz T eoreticheskogo Gradusa Solomonskih vedeniy ( Conversations from the Theoretic Degree of Solomon Cognizances , DMS RSL, F . 14, N 250, f. 93-93r) we read: ‘ Y ou are sufficiently learned that God teaches us in three ways: (1) He points us at the Nature as the manifested Wisdom Divine; (2) He gives to us the rule for Improvement of our Manners; (3) through all this, He guides us to True Innermost Theology, or to living cognition of the Divine Word. And this threefold teaching we must transform thoroughly in our activity, in order that it came, day by day, in our life, and our inner man was fed on this, grew and strengthened in God’ . 54 From (Anon.), ‘ The Condition of Man Before the Fall’ , 235. 55 Ibid., 238."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"42 KONSTANTIN BURMISTROV & MARIA ENDEL The true Kabbalah Russian masons considered the “ true Kabbalah” 56 an essential part of the pri- mordial Wisdom, which is required for the fallen man to return to “ Eden” . ‘ When people began to forfeit these gifts [those of primordial Wisdom], they were forced to transmit their knowledge about the nature and God Himself to their offspring by means of “ inscriptions” or hieroglyphs’ 57 . And it is just the Kabbalah which contains those hieroglyphs, that ‘ represent attributes of things in the world’ 58 . Moreover, up to the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, Kabbalah was the only source of the primeval Light and primordial Wisdom Adam had taken out of Paradise. Similar views are expressed in the works of Ivan Elagin, one of the most outstanding Russian masons of the 18 th century: Kabbalah is a symbolic or formative doctrine of Divine mysteries received and accepted from God, which is essential and useful for the holy God-seeing. There- fore, this teaching is considered the true knowledge of allegories, symbols, and hieroglyphs of the Divine words [... ] [Solomon] bade to extract sense and under- standing from the law of Holy Scripture on grounds of kabbalistic doctrine. Thus the main essence of Kabbalah is to leave the external and literal sense of Holy Scripture and word of God, and to penetrate the interior thoughts of the Holy Ghost 59 . In the opinion of J. Schwarz, the leader of Moscow Rosicrucians in the early 1780s, masonry was a secret science whose first adepts were Jewish sectarians. T he principle underlying the doctrine of Rosicrucians is the con- cept of a “ spark of light” transferred from one wise man to another through the chain of Tradition. ‘ Thus this mystery [i.e. the primordial doctrine, received by Rosicrucians] passed to the religious Jewish sects of Essenes and Therapeutes which existed in the days of Christ and were renowned for their virtuousness [... ] Just from these Essenes was derived a glorious Order of Rosicrucians who received the “ spark of light” , together with the virtue of 56 A conditional term denoting a special masonic version of Jewish Kabbalah based on its interpretation by Christian kabbalists of the fifteenth– seventeenth centuries.

In such a way, according to Russian masons, was the funda- mental masonic tradition established 61 . Tikkun ha-olam: the aims of masonic activity and Kabbalah Masonic activity was not reduced however to self-knowledge, knowledge of Nature, and God. Its underlying principle was a kabbalistic and alchemical impulse for the improvement and salvation of the world fallen with Adam. The process of universal improvement ( tikkun ) is described in some masonic texts. The clearest exposition is contained in the treatise “ An Oration of the Man of Eziless ” 62 . The necessity of tikkun is caused by a disruption in the process of creation that resulted in serious structural alterations in the world. Like medi- eval kabbalists, masonic authors, however, were sure that this disruption was an inevitable stage on the way of transformation, or “ softening” of the Divine attribute of Judgment (Sefirah Din ), which is intrinsic to the very nature of God. Indeed, ‘ as God is omniscient, He could not help knowing what hap- pened with His creation; and as He is omnipotent, He could have built in such a way that no corruption would happen afterwards’ 63 . However, the art of Creation is similar to the work of a goldsmith, in whose arms ‘ gold [... ] is transformed in different ways, needless parts are detached and gathered again, they are purified and become better then they have been before’ 64 . The amend- ment and improvement of the creation, i.e. the transformation of the force of Judgment into the force of Charity , is likened also to the alchemical transmuta- tion of Copper (=Judgment, Sefirah Din ) to Silver (Charity, Sefirah Hesed ) 65 . Anyway, it is man who must purify and amend the spheres of the Universe accessible to him; special groups of elected initiates, i.e. masons, played a pivotal role in the process. 60 Semeka, ‘ Russian Rosicrucians and the works by Catherine II against Masonry’ , 350. 61 See ibid., 358. It is noteworthy that one of the masonic pseudoepigrapha, Letter of the Rabbi of Lisbon to the Rabbi of Brest (1817; originally written in Polish), states that the Craft (or “ Hafshim Goderim” Sociery) has been established by the biblical characters; masonry itself is considered there a secret Jewish order whose members, inter alia, acknowledge Christianity .

Just this impulse induced the masons to work for charitable causes, in the field of public education and amendment of manners, and at the same time to carry out alchemical experi- ments aimed at the “ improvement” and “ salvation” of gross metals and their transmutation into gold. Kabbalistic hermeneutics Biblical hermeneutics and kabbalistic methods of interpretation played an es- sential role in the masonic system. Masons believed that by unveiling the hid- den meaning of the Scriptures they would be able to comprehend the depth of the universe, to establish an intercourse with the spiritual world and to dis- cover the ways for emendation of the fallen world including human society and human nature. With this end in view , some of them studied Hebrew and tried to read and interpret the Hebrew Bible while turning to kabbalistic sym- bols and methods ( gematria , notarikon , temurah ). W e cite below an excerpt taken from a private letter where an active Rosicrucian, prince Nikolay N. Trubetskoi (1744-1821) 66 , explains to a mason of a higher initiation, Aleksey A. Rzhevski (1737-1804) 67 , the importance of Kabbalah for masonic work. This text is especially significant for our discourse for it reflects the real inter- ests and everyday problems of Russian masons. In the beginning, its author writes about ‘ the importance and necessity of Hebrew’ for masonic art 68 . Then he argues that you should not study kabbalistic interpretation s of the Scrip- tures (i.e. “ spiritual matters” ) until you have comprehended the science of na- ture (i.e. “ material matters” ). I guess that the mysterious sense of Mosaic writings is conceivable not by calcu- lation, or creation of a new word from each letter; for the words as Moses has written them are not the same now as they were at his time [... ] The direct way to the achievement of truth is that of Abraham who, at the beginning, had known a slave and engendered with her Ishmael, and afterwards he got Isaac from Sarah. For this science [i.e. Kabbalah] not only unveils spiritual things but we may say that it is spiritual by itself; but how can a mortal know about the spiritual matters until he has known about the material ones [... ] Those who practise this science 66 He was one of the most active and devoted Rosicrucians, a member of the Friendly Learned Society and masonic “ Typographic Company” .

Therefore, Moses himself could not attain spiritual matters when he was completely unfamiliar with the material ones. This is why I conclude that the meaning of [what Moses has said] is going from mouth to mouth up to our times, and that this mysterious meaning is contained not in letters but in the words themselves. For example, in the first chapter of Genesis, the word “ et” (“ eth” , in Hebrew) indicates the clearest es- sence; but also it is the conjunction “ and” , therefore it was translated as “ and the earth” ; it is still possible to translate as “ essence of the earth” . However if some- body had previously an experience in studying the material matters in nature and has some knowledge of Hebrew, then he is able easily , without calculation, to recognize the true meaning of Moses’ [words... ] And one who knows the true sense of the [word] Elohim , the acting person in the first chapter of Genesis, will understand easily that the material matters should be conceived before the spir- itual ones... I hope however for your modesty , venerable Brother, that after reading you will tear this letter into pieces, and will not discuss its content with anybody... 69 . Referring to the masonic tradition as a whole, we can conclude that Russian masons used Kabbalah, firstly, as a basis for their cosmogonic system, ex- plaining the hierarchical construction of the heavenly world, and for commu- nication with this world. Secondly , Kabbalah provided the keys for interpret- ing the Scriptures and discovering the deepest and secret layers of the biblical text. It is possible to discern, moreover, behind the masonic soteriology some adapted kabbalistic concepts, and first and foremost – the concept of Tikkun ha-olam 70 . For the masons, Kabbalah contains the true knowledge about God, the world, and man and not only facilitates the process of universal amend- ment but also determines its paths and ways. Kabbalistic texts in the literature of Russian masons As we have also mentioned above, we managed to discover in Moscow State archives a significant number of masonic MSs which indicate a deep interest in and a good acquaintance of Russian Brothers with Jewish Mysticism. We have divided these texts into three main groups 71 . 69 Ibid., 236-237. This letter is dated from the mid-1780s. 70 This kabbalistic concept was adopted and expressed distinctly in the doctrine of the mysti- cal school, established by Martines de Pasqually and his pupil L.C. de Saint-Martin. Their writ- ings and ideas enjoyed great popularity among Russian Brothers.

It should be stressed that masonic translations are hardly similar to translations in the strict meaning of the word. They are rather mixtures of translations and commentaries, loose translations and expositions, with addi- tions made by the translator or interpolations from other texts. Therefore, it is very difficult to identify the different layers in these texts and comprehend all the transformations made from the original texts. Russian masons of the late 18 th century were familiar with one of the basic texts of Jewish mysticism, Sefer Yezirah ( The Book of Creation , 3– 6 centuries C.E.), a short cosmogonic treatise about the creation of the universe and man by means of Hebrew letters and numbers 72 . At least two Russian translations of this text are kept now in MSs collections 73 . Also in several writings one can meet long quotations from Sefer ha-Zohar ( The Book of Splendour , 13 th cen- tury) 74 which appears to have been the most important and well known kabba- listic text for Russian masons 75 . We also found a very interesting translation of the famous treatise Shaare Orah ( The Gates of Light ) by Joseph Gikatilla (the 13 th century) 76 , with nu- merous quotations from the classic commentary to this text written by Mattityahu Delacrut, a Polish kabbalist of the 16 th century . In the same MS codex there is an abridged version of Ma‘ amar ’ Adam de-’ Azilut , an anony- mous text belonging to Lurianic Kabbalah 77 . These texts seem to be a direct translation from Hebrew, but they contain so many interpolations that it is reasonable to conclude their translator was a true Christian kabbalist 78 . 72 This text is very popular in the Jewish tradition; many Jewish mystics and philosophers have commented it. See Scholem, Kabbalah , 23-30. This work was also very important for the Christian kabbalists who translated it to the Latin and other European languages.

In our opinion, texts like these demonstrate their knowledge of Hebrew and quite possibly their acquaintance with Kabbalists who possessed an oral tradition. The second group comprises translations into Russian of the works of Euro- pean Christian kabbalists and researchers of Kabbalah. It is represented by translations made mostly from German and Latin. In this connection such works as True and Right Kabbalah by Wilhelm Kriegesmann, A Short V ersion of the Kabbalistic Teaching by Jacob Brucker, and The Jewish Kabbalah by Caspar Schott should be mentioned 79 . The authors of these writings based their knowledge of Kabbalah on the works of Pico della Mirandola, Johannes Reuchlin, Pietro di Galatino, Athanasius Kircher and other Christian kabbalists of the 15 th -17 th centuries; they used many quotations taken both from these works and from the kabbalistic texts, first of all, from Sefer ha-Zohar .

Only these texts allow us to reconstruct masonic views related to Kabbalah. It seems very im- portant to find out who were the putative authors or translators of these texts. As we mentioned above, the “ kabbalistic” texts belong not to the “ intra- masonic” writings but rather to the “ circle of masonic reading” . This means that the Russian masons were not obliged to share the concepts contained in these texts. Besides, the number of the texts was relatively small – several dozens versus several thousands of extant masonic manuscripts 81 . 79 See DMS RSL, F . 14, N 1613, or F . 147, N 193 (original text: Kriegesmann, Die wahre und richtige Cabalah , Frankfurt, Leipzig 1774); DMS RSL, F. 14, N 1644, Pt.5.

It should be noted that in almost every manuscript, data about the author and source are lacking. Besides, they could also be influenced by “ primary sources” of the Christian Kabbalah, e.g., the famous book De Occulta Philosophia by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim (the first complete edition – Cologne, 1533): see DMS RSL, F . 14, N 705, N 1625-27. 80 The principal concepts presented in these texts are reviewed in Burmistrov and Endel, ‘ Kabbalah in Russian Masonry’ , 33-43.

The head of the Palace chancel- lery, he played an important role in political life 82 . It is known that Catherine herself sometimes jokingly signed documents as “ Chancellor of Mr. Elagin” . Joined to the Craft in 1750s, in 1770 he had been elected Grand Master of the Grand Provincial Lodge of Russia under the auspices of the Berlin Grand Lodge, “ Royal Y ork” . Thus he became the chief of the first masonic union in Russia. On February 26, 1772 he received from the Great Master of the United Great Lodge of England the certificate of the first Provincial Grand Master of the Empire of Russia in Russian history . In the middle of the 1770s, Elagin’ s System included not less than 14 lodges and maintained contacts with many European lodges 83 . The new stage in his activity began in the late 1780s, when he established a renewed masonic association and became its Grand Master. In the closing stages of his life, he wrote a voluminous composition A Treatise on Russia ( Opit povestvovaniya o Rossii ), an uncompleted work on Russian his- tory , where his masonic views were presented 84 . In the Introduction to one of his unpublished writings, Elagin described in detail his spiritual biography . He joined masonry in his youth but did not find anything attractive there and soon left the lodge. After a short period of enthu- siasm for V oltaire and Helvetius he returned to masonic activity with much more serious intentions. He looked for the teachers who could initiate him into the mysteries of Divine knowledge, he was ready to learn and to teach this knowledge all his life. By his own words, it was his high position in masonry that impelled him continuously ‘ to strive hard to solve [i.e. to understand] this mysterious and numinous teaching’ 85 . For, as he writes in the same Introduc- tion, ‘ my sincerity did not allow me to lead my Brothers in the way unknown to myself. Therefore I began with all my thoroughness to spend vast sums of 82 On Elagin and his masonic system see V ernadsky, Russian Masonry in the Reign of Catherine the Great , 44-70, 94– 98; Semeka, ‘ Russian Masonry in the Eighteenth Century’ , 139- 149; Pypin, Masonry in Russia , 96-137; Pekarski, Supplements to the history of Masonry in Russia in the Eighteenth Century , 50-55; Smith, Working the Rough Stone , 104-105.

The result of these expenses was, however, an understanding that it is impossible to buy truth for money , and that ‘ for real [i.e. common] gold’ you can receive but ‘ the search for imaginary gold’ . Thus at the end of 1770s Elagin was disappointed in the English system of masonry which was taught in Russian lodges when he had been their Head. In despair, Elagin immersed himself in reading the Old and New Testaments and Fathers of the Church. Then he began to feel the neces- sity of studying Greek and Hebrew . On this new path, the most important role was played by his acquaintance with Baron Johannes George von Reuchel (1729-1791) 87 . Baron von Reuchel was the Head of lodges that worked according to the Swedish-Berlin system of Johann Wilhelm Ellenberger (von Zinnendorf) (1731-1782 ), known as the “ System of Relaxed Observation” (“ Laxe Observanz” ) 88 . V on Reuchel’ s ma- sonic union, established in St. Petersburg in 1771, was in fact an opponent to Elagin’ s masonry , and therefore rather complicated relations were established between them. At the same time, von Reuchel became Elagin’ s mentor on his spiritual path. In the words of Elagin, this ‘ respectable brother, initiated in the true masonry’ , explained to him ‘ an ancient mysterious knowledge called the Sacred Wisdom’ 89 . There is some evidence that Reuchel also was interested in Kabbalah and Talmud 90 . It was Reuchel who provided Elagin with various mystical MSs and explained their secret and symbolic meaning. He gave him many masonic texts and for many years (at least, from 1777 up to 1786) he induced Elagin ‘ to read the books which he had earlier disdained as stupid’ 91 . In Elagin’ s archive, one can find various MSs related to von Reuchel. In our opinion, von Reuchel facilitated Elagin’ s interest in “ secret knowledge” , in- cluding Kabbalah; but this interest developed to the full extent due to his ac- quaintance with another mentor. 86 Ibid. 87 ‘ Reuchel was sent in Russia by the National Lodge of Berlin (working after Zinnendorf ’ s System) “ to break the absolutism of Englishmen” . He headed in Russia the so-called “ Reuchel’ s” masonic system.

The gentleman spoken of is a certain Stanislaus Pines Eli (or Ely) who, in the words of Elagin, ‘ was an expert in our science, in the art of healing, and in Hebrew and Kabbalah’ . For many years, Eli taught him ‘ everything what is necessary and needful for comprehension of mystical sense and out- landish sayings which are so plenty in the writings of Moses and other proph- ets’ . 92 Considering the name of this man, and his knowledge of Hebrew and Kabbalah, we may suggest that he was a converted Jew . He was a native of Kolin (Bohemia) who received medical education at Berlin and Frankfurt-am- Oder. In 1778 (or 1776) 93 Eli arrived in St. Petersburg where he got a certifi- cate for medical practice 94 . About that time he met Elagin and became his mentor. He also was able to cure his pupil from a fatal illness. Elagin reported that Eli was the author of a masonic book Fraternal Admo- nitions to Some Brethern Free Masons written by Br . Seddag ( Bratskiye uve- shchaniya k nekotorim brat’ yam svbdn kmnshchkm. Pisani bratom Sedda- gom ) 95 . In Pypin’ s opinion, this book was ‘ a typical example of Rosicrucian nonsense, with its false depth and theological and alchemical inventions’ 96 . It was very popular among Moscow Rosicrucians. It is written in symbolic and rather abstruse language and contains some elements that may definitely relate to Jewish mysticism. Thus one finds there a lengthy discourse on the great mystical power of the Tetragrammaton, with its numerical interpretatio n. The author also teaches his Brothers how to study the Scriptures in a specific “ kab- balistic” way: Read, my brother, read the Holy Creation, read its gradual consequences, read it by the clear inner eye ‘ of sages whose eye is in their head’ as overwise Solomon 92 RSAAA, F . 8, N 216, Pt. 3, f. 8r.

Novikov mentions Eli among the members of Elagin’ s lodges 98 . In 1786 Eli was appointed (probably with a help of Elagin) to the position of head of the Economic Chancellery at the Medical Board; he was also a member of the Free Economic Society 99 . This is almost all the information available about Dr. Eli who appears to be one of the most important figures relevant for our topic. Kabbalistic studies of Elagin We can estimate the results of Elagin’ s kabbalistic studies by the content of his manuscript collection, and especially by two of his own works. He planned to write a large composition devoted to the history of masonry and mystical doc- trines from ancient times up to the end of the 18 th century: Doctrine of ancient philosophy and divine knowledge, or knowledge of Free Masons and diverse makers, profane, ecclesiastic, and mystic, collected and presented in five parts by I.E., the Grand Master of the Russian provincial lodge 100 . He began to write the book in 1786 but two years later, in 1788, he had finished only a part of what he planned 101 . Thus we must judge about his design taken in its entirety by an extant project. It is noteworthy that in the project (in the 2 nd book) there were a chapter 3 titled About T almud and T argum , chapter 5 About kabbalistic Art. On Sefirot, on the Names of God , and chapter 10 About the 32 grades and the 50 gates for the great wisdom 102 . In the course of work the project was, however, changed significantly .

In the 2 nd book, instead of Talmud, there is a description of the first two degrees of masonry. The 3 rd book contains an explanation of two other degrees of masonry . The 4 th book that was devoted to the 5 th –7 th degrees is missing, and only some sketches devoted to “ the confirmation of the Existence of God and Incarnation” remain of the 5 th book 103 . In the available MS, there are, in particular, twelve pages all devoted to the interpretation of Hebrew words. T hus the composition does not correspond to its earlier plan, and speculations on Kabbalah and Talmud are presented there only fragmentarily. The second of Elagin’ s compositions, named Explanations of the mysteri- ous meaning [of the text] about Creation of the Universe in Holy Scripture, which is a key for understanding of the Book of Truth and Errors is mostly devoted to his kabbalistic studies (unfortunately only some parts of this com- position are available) 104 . The text represents an extensive kabbalistic com- mentary to the main points of the masonic doctrine: God and Creation, ele- ments and Divine names, etc. On the basis of Holy Scripture – using the kabbalistic concepts Ein-Sof , emanation of the Sefirot , Adam Kadmon , four worlds- Olamot , as well as the hermeneutic techniques of gematria , notarikon , and temurah – Elagin developed a kabbalistic version of the masonic cos- mogony . This composition is especially interesting for another reason: one can see here a discerning and decoding of the kabbalistic subtext in the book Des Erreurs et de la Vé rité (Lyon 1775) by Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin which is absolutely unclear for uninitiated readers. T he kabbalistic and non-Christian interpretation of the New Testament in Elagin’ s text appears to be especially strange. Thus Elagin treats Jesus Christ as the perennial man, Adam Kadmon, whilst he looks upon the historical Jesus from Nazareth as a mason and one of the “ hieroglyphs” , or “ effective images” of the Perennial Jesus. Elagin is an outstanding phenomenon that shows to us how strong was the interest in Kabbalah among educated Russian people in the late 18 th century. Though he was a prominent statesman and Orthodox Christian, he devoted most of his life to the study of a tradition that seemingly was very distant from the Russian life of that time. However, when we try to understand the reasons for this strange interest, and consider the influence Jewish thought had on the Weltanschauung of people similar to Elagin, we get a chance to better under- 103 The Introduction to the work has been published twice.

The Moscow Order of Rosicrucians As mentioned above, Kabbalah also was very significant for the members of the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross 105 . The tradition of perception, inter- pretation, and transmission of kabbalistic texts established by these people existed for almost a century and a half, from the 1770s through the 1920s. They translated a truly great number of writings of European mystics, alche- mists, natural philosophers, and Christian kabbalists: all in all, hundreds of volumes. In addition, they created many original mystical texts. When ma- sonry was prohibited in Russia in 1822, masonic activity continued, but with- out the Lodges; and only after the communist revolution did it completely cease. The great bulk of the texts were composed in the late 18 th - early 19 th centu- ries in the circle of Moscow “ theorists” (or “ theoretical masons” ). The most prominent members of the group were Johann Schwarz, Nikolay Novikov, Semion Gamaleya (1743-1822), Nikolay Trubetskoi, and, in the early 19 th cen- tury , Joseph A. Pozdeev (1746-1820), Ruf S. Stepanov (1745-1828) etc. These people were members of the Order of Gold and Rosy Cross and had higher masonic degrees known as the Theoretical Degree of the Solomon Sci- ences and Rosicrucian degrees. Most of the texts available now were kept in the collection of a masonic “ dynasty” Arsenievs (DMS RSL, F 13-14 – V .S. Arseniev’ s stock) which included a considerable part of the manuscripts be- longing to the Moscow “ theorists” 106 . It should be noted that the Arsenievs not only kept the old MSs: during the whole 19 th century these texts were continu- ously studied and commented, and new translations and original works were added to this Library . 105 On this Order see also Vernadsky, Russian Masonry in the Reign of Catherine the Great , 102-120; Tukalevsky , ‘ N.

Lopukhin (1756- 1816) as well as people possessing an extraordinary spiritual authority (though they might have no special social status), such as Semion Gamaleya 107 . Their activity was concentrated around Moscow University , the biggest Moscow publishing houses and printers, and magazines. All these people differed from each other in many respects but were united due to the rite of Rosicrucian initiation. The Rosicrucian hierarchy was divided into nine stages, or “ degrees” . The first one, an introductory “ Junior” degree, followed immediately the fourth degree of regular masonry (“ Scottish Master” ). Then came the “ Theoreticus” (the “ Theoretic degree of Solomon Sciences” ), and everybody who attained this degree became a Rosicrucian. The next seven degrees were named the higher degrees 108 . It is known that in Russia only about two dozen people pos- sessed these higher degrees. The most advanced among them were J. Schwarz, G . Schrö der, N. Novikov and N. Trubetskoi 109 . Each degree implied study of certain secret sciences and some practical activity (in the field of magic, theurgy , alchemy , etc.). In the seventh degree, Adeptus exemptus, initiates got familiar with the stone of wisdom, Kabbalah, and natural magic; those who attained the ninth degree (Magus) ‘ knew everything and mastered everything like Moses, Aaron, Hermes’ 110 .

They themselves might deny this for fear of being accused of conspiracy . Thus, the Head of the Order, Novikov , answered during examination that the Brothers did not have such a possibility; the archive materials available allow us how- ever to be strongly suspicious of his words. The content of masonic archives, and translations of kabbalistic texts as well as original compositions of Rus- sian masons devoted to Kabbalah which we discovered in the archives are indicative of their deep acquaintance with this tradition. It seems obvious that they tried to use their knowledge in practice, though they themselves tried to look like “ pure” theorists. As a scholar noted, ‘ the Brothers of Gold and Rose Cross were selected among the selected. The Rosicrucians strove to reach a super-natural state, to converse with God, to invoke spirits, to command them and having known all the secrets of the nature, to become the lords of their own destiny [... ] Many Rosicrucians bore witness that it is impossible to de- scribe the blissful and immortal state of body into which they sunk when striv- ing to attain an ecstatic experience’ 112 . Johann Schwarz Let us consider in detail an outstanding figure, Johann G . Schwarz (1751- 1784) 113 who was the founder of Moscow branch of the Order and the spiritual leader and preceptor of Russian masons. He was one of a few Brothers who 111 For example Semeka suggested that ‘ Russian Rosicrucians did not carry out alchemic experiments because they did not go beyond the “ Theoretic Degree of the Solomon Sciences” ’ . See Semeka, ‘ Russian Rosicrucians and the works by Catherine II against Masonry’ , 365-366. This sceptical view is based mainly on the confessions of masons themselves made during ex- aminations. Thus the leader of Moscow “ theorists” N. Novikov answered investigation officer S. I. Sheshkovsky: ‘ Neither of us could practise Magic and Kabbalah, having attained only lower degrees, and I do not know anything about these sciences except their names’ .

There is every reason to believe that some Moscow Rosicrucians were occupied with practical application of the masonic tripar- tite doctrine – “ Magic-Alchemy-Kab balah” . As Kiesewetter notes, ‘ Lopukhin, Trubetskoi and Kutuzov were highly interested in the art of Rosicrucian Alchemy and dreamed that they would attain higher degrees. For this aim Kutuzov was sent to Berlin to practise alchemy near the very fount of Rosicrucian wisdom’ . – Kiesewetter, ‘ Moscow Rosicrucians of the Eighteenth Cen- tury’ , 103-104.

He re- ceived a law degree at Jena University , and spent some time in Asia as official of the Dutch United East Indian Company. After his meeting with a Russian mason, Prince I.S. Gagarin (1752-1810) 115 , he arrived in Mogiliov (Russia) in 1776. He settled in Moscow by 1779 where he had various positions at Mos- cow University (in particular, he was appointed “ professor in ordinary in phi- losophy” ). He had great authority with the students of the University . In addi- tion, he initiated the establishment of the Pedagogic and Translator seminaries, the first Russian student society , “ Association of University Alumni” , and the “ Friendly Learned Society” . These institutions became centers of the intellec- tual life of the time 116 . It is known that Schwarz gave lectures not only at the University but also at home, where he discussed the most “ esoteric” themes 117 . Among his listeners were many masons who later became famous Rosicrucians, e.g. A.F. Labzin (1766-1825) 118 and M.I. Nevzorov (1762- 1827) 119 . In his writings, Schwarz refers to Kabbalah many times.

Kabbalah in masonry in 1792-1822 In 1792, the Russian government destroyed the circle of Moscow Rosicru- cians; afterwards, many masonic lodges gave up their activity. The lodges re- mained and were reopened but existed secretly and were in fact illegal. T he most interesting among them was “ the Lodge of Neptune” opened in Moscow in 1798. Its members continued Rosicrucian activity , read and translated the works of European mystics, and collected a great library of mystical books 121 . At the beginning of the 19 th century , some small circles of “ theorists” func- tioned in St. Petersburg (under the guidance of A.F. Labzin) and in Moscow (guided by I.A. Pozdeev) 122 . Even after the official legalization of masonic activity in 1803, they continued to work inconspicuously . Taking into consid- eration the extant part of Pozdeev’ s library , the members of his lodge had inter- est in Kabbalah. In this collection, there are some kabbalistic books that be- longed formerly to the voluminous library of a mason Ivan Filatyev . An interesting mystical Illuminati society “ T he New Israel” (or “ The Peo- ple of God” ) was founded in 1785 by a Polish nobleman Tadeusz (Thaddeus) Leszczyc-Grabiank a (1740-1807) at Avignon and moved in the early 19 th cen- tury to St. Petersburg 123 .

Pozdejev joined the Order in 1784 and afterwards became one of the leaders of “ theo- retical” masonry of the age of Alexander I. See Serkov, Russian Masonry , 649-50. 123 Grabianka was a member of the secret society Academi des Vrais Maç ons, established in 1780s by the mystic and alchemist Benedictine abbé Dom A. Pernety (1716-1796). The Academie was especially active in Avignon, Lion and Montpellier. This body probably was a continuation of the Acadé mie des Sages (dating back to the second half of the seventeenth cen- tury), which had branches in Avignon, Montpellier, Douai and Mohilev (Ukraine).

Pleshcheyev and Prince N.V . Repnin) but after his arrival in St. Petersburg (in August, 1805) Grabianka found numerous admirers among the aristocracy (meetings of the society took place in the Marble Palace, in the rooms of the crown-prince Konstantin Pavlovich). Among the members were almost all eminent Russian Rosi- crucians; they predicted that ‘ by God’ s order, the Second and near Advent of our Lord Jesus Christ, and His glorious reign on the earth’ would occur in 1835. A select part of the members of the society constituted a “ Council of Prophets” and had “ correspondence with heaven” 124 . The prophesies were ac- complished in an ecstatic state, and the preparation to this experience required keeping the fast and solitude. Grabianka, the “ King of the New Israel” , is known to have had a keen interest in Jewish mysticism; he was a pupil of the abbé Louis-Philibert de Morveau (Brumore) (?-1786), a famous mason, alche- mist and kabbalist, ‘ a wiseman “ who had a voice [i.e. the gift of prophecy]” through the science of numbers, or Kabbalah’ 125 . M. Longinov suggested that ‘ Grabianka had to read the Bible very assiduously, and studying it he expected to attain an understanding of the higher magic that was promised to him due to kabbalistic computations’ 126 . His prediction of the Second Advent was prob- ably based on these “ computations” 127 . Another outstanding figure within masonry of the early 19 th century was Johann A. Fessler 128 , the well-known reformer of masonry who established his own “ scientific system” (“ sientificheskuyu sistemu” ) in which central atten- tion was concentrated on the moral principles of the masonic teaching. He came to Russia in 1809 in order to be the head of the Hebrew Chair at St. Petersburg Ecclesiastical Academy . Around him, a circle of scholars including authoritative masons was assembled. He probably taught the masons inter- ested in Kabbalah the language of the Old Testament.

Ruf Stepanov, one of the most respected Russian masonic elders 129 , taught in secret masonic meetings, that though ‘ external lodges have been closed [... ] nobody can prohibit [us] to work in our internal lodges; and though Freemasonry may be exterminated, the Order ’ s goal can not be abol- ished’ 130 . At the same time, the number of people who were involved in this activity was rather small, hardly exceeding 80 members 131 . In addition, some “ theoretic” masons belonged to the “ interior” Rosicrucian Order, whose meet- ings occurred four times a year 132 . The meetings did not include any rites (except for initiation ceremonies); the Brothers were occupied with reading mystical works and commenting on them. All their activity was directed to self-correction and restoration of the primeval pure nature in the soul. They continued to pay special attention to translations of various works on mysticism, alchemy and Kabbalah. In particular, in the MSs collection of Arseniev’ s family there are several very important compositions written in the 40s– 50s of the 19 th century ‘ by the hand of A.A. Filosofov’ 133 . In all probability, the author had a knowledge of Hebrew; his notes on Hebrew , and mystical meaning of Hebrew letters are indicative of his acquaintance with the language. Within his papers we find a relatively correct translation of Sefer Y ezirah , some fragments of Sefer ha-Zohar , Sefer ha-T emunah , and other kabbalistic texts. At the same time, “ theoretical” masons continued their public activity and cherished plans of social and moral amendment in Russia. In the mid 19 th cen- tury , their main bases were Moscow University, Moscow governor general Chancellery , Moscow and Tula Clubs of the nobility, and Moscow depart- ments of the Senate. Masonic influence on the Orthodox Church and ecclesias- tical censorship was especially strong 134 .

A. Golubinsky; on a member of the Holy Synod V .I. Kutnevich, etc. A number of priests and abbots also were among the “ theoretical” Brothers.

Gagarin was its chairman, a mason S.P . Shipov its vice-chairman). The Society became a stronghold of Russian liberal noblemen, whose belief in social reforms was based on the masonic outlook. These people had a certain influence on the abolition of serfdom in 1861 135 . It is noteworthy that one of the main proponents of the reform was S.S. Lanskoy (1787-1862) 136 , one of the heads of Russian masonry and Minister of Interior, who had close relations with the Brothers, the members of this Society 137 . The Secretary of the Society was S.A. Maslov (1793-1879) , one of ideolo- gists of the “ theoretical” masonry and a Rosicrucian of higher initiation 138 . He also founded The Agricultural Magazine ( Zemlyedel’ cheskiy Zhurnal ) where his ‘ translations [of the articles] on agricultural problems’ were printed. At the same time, Maslov translated into Russian the fundamental work Philosophie der Geschichte oder ü ber die Tradition ( Philosophy of History, or On Tradi- tion ) by Christian kabbalist F .J. Molitor (1779-1861) . It is noteworthy that Molitor had a high masonic degree and was historiographer of the masonic Order of the Asiatic Brethren which was tightly connected with the Rosicru- cian movement. The doctrine and rites of this Order are known to be deeply influenced by kabbalistic and Frankist ideology 139 . Molitor’ s bulky work is devoted to a detailed analysis of Christianity and Judaism and a comparison between Jewish and Christian mysticism. In G . Scholem’ s opinion, Molitor was the last Christian kabbalist who had a deep comprehension of the Jewish mystical tradition, ‘ he revealed [... ] an insight into the world of Kabbalah far superior to that of most Jewish scholars of his time’ 140 . Molitor’ s book also had an essential effect on the views of Scholem himself 141 .

A MS of this book translated into Russian in 1861 is in Arseniev’ s archive. Gradually , activity of “ theoretic” masons was fading away . Regular meet- ings continued up to the 1870s, and the last case of reception occurred in early 20 th century when V .S. Arseniev (1829-1915) , the Supreme leader of the Order and a preserver of masonic heritage, initiated into the Order his son and grand- son 143 . It is worthy of note that the last representative of this tradition, Father Johann Arseniev, studied in the first years of the 20 th century the same treatise by Samuel Richter Die wahrhaffte und vollkommene Bereitung des philoso- phischen Steins der Brü derschafft aus dem Orden des Gü lden und Rosen- Creutzes (1710) from which, as a matter of fact, began the history of the “ new Rosicrucians” 144 . Conclusions It is obvious that the interest of Russian masons in Jewish mysticism was far from superficial, as might seem to be the case at first glance. They looked on Kabbalah as a tradition that preserved invaluable grains of ancient wisdom, true knowledge which had been granted to mankind through revelation. In addition, Kabbalah, pari passu with Magic and Alchemy, was an integral part of the masonic doctrine. It elucidated the structure of divine and terrestrial worlds and the relationship between them, and assisted in revealing the hidden sense of the Scriptures. Moreover, masonic enthusiasm for Kabbalah was aimed at rather practical purposes. Kabbalistic concepts of the universal man ( Adam Kadmon ) and global improvement ( tikkun ha-olam ) served as an ideo- logical basis for the masonic program of radical reformation of social, politi- cal, moral and religious conditions in Russia. It is known that the masonic teaching, in general, and its kabbalistic ele- ments, in particular, played a significant role in Russian literature, and not only in the writings of “ masonic” authors like M. Kheraskov and S. Bobrov but also in the work of V . Odoyevski, N. Gogol, A. Stepanov, D. Begichev, etc. 145 . 142 Molitor’ s ideas were circulated not only in masonic circles; among his readers was, e.g., a Russian writer and Romanticist V . F. Odoyevski. See Catalogue of V .F . Odoyevski’ s Library , 368 (N 3101). 143 See about Arseniev’ s masonic dynasty Serkov, Russian Masonry , 69-71. 144 A copy of this rare book with handwritten notes made by V .S. and I.V .

T hus, social and politic concepts of mystical masonry be- came an ideological basis for 18 th century Russian conservatism. In the early 19 th century when rationalist masonry was expanded anew, the Rosicrucians typified the conservative ideals. T heir religious and political views exerted a great influence on the development of Russian Romantic philosophy and so- cial utopianism in the first half of the 19 th century as well as of the Slavophile movement 146 . Obviously enough, these ideas remained very important in Rus- sian religious philosophy of the late 19 th -early 20 th centuries (V . Soloviev, S. Bulgakov, P . Florenski, N. Berdyaev) 147 .

Jahrhunderts zu erforschen. Die Untersu- chung ist auf die groß e Menge der Handschriften die sich in russischen Archiven befinden und auf die wenig bekannten V erö ffentlichungen in russischen freimaurerischen Zeitschriften be- grü ndet. Die russische Freimaurerei war augenscheinlich die einfluß reichste geistige, gesell- schaftliche und politische Kraft am Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts. Die synkretische freimaurerische Lehre kombinierte die Elemente von verschiedenen religiö sen und esoterischen Traditionen, dar- unter waren die jü dische Kabbala und ihre christlichen Auslegungen. Der Artikel analysiert kabbalistische Ä uß erungen in der Lehre der freimaurerischen Logen und geheimen Orden. Die Entstehung der russischen Logen und ihrer Verbindungen mit den geheimen Gesellschaften in Europa betrachtend, versuchen die Autoren die wichtigsten esoterischen Strö mungen am Endes des 18. Jahrhunderts, die die russischen Brü der (vor allem, Rosenkreuzer und Martinisten) zum Erlernen der Kabbala trieben, zu ermitteln. Die russischen Rosenkreuzer waren die hauptsä chli- chen Anhä nger der Kabbala. Sie haben den Hauptanteil der kabbalistischen Texte ü bersetzt. Und viele Werke, unter Verwendung jü disch-mystischer Konzepte, geschrieben. Alle diese Texte sind unverö ffentlicht und sind nur als Handschriften vorhanden. Es wird argumentiert, daß das Interesse der russischen Freimaurer am jü dischen Mysticismus nicht oberflä chlich war. Sie betrachteten die Kabbala als eine Tradition, die unschä tzbare Samen der uralten Weisheit bewahrt hatte – Wissen das der Menschheit durch Offenbarung geschenkt worden war. Auß erdem war die Kabbala, wie Magie und Alchemie, ein Bestandteil der freimau- rerischen Lehre. Sie erklä rte den Aufbau der gö ttlichen und irdischen Welten und ihrer Bezie- hungen, und sie half den verborgenen Sinn der heiligen Schrift zu enthü llen. Die freimaurerische Begeisterung fü r die Kabbala hatte auch eine praktische Richtung. Die kabbalistischen Konzep- tionen der universellen Menschheit (Adam Kadmon) und der allgemeinen V erbesserung (tikkun ha-olam) waren ideologische Grundlagen des freimaurerischen Programms zur radikalen Refor- mation des gesellschaftlichen, politischen, moralischen und religiö sen Lebens in Ruß land."}]
